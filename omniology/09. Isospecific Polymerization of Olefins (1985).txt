Preface 
The discoveries of organometallic catalysts for olefin polymerization by Karl Ziegler 
and that of stereoregular olefin polymers by Giulio Natta are probably the two most 
important achievements in the areas of catalysis and polymer chemistry in the 
second half of this century. They led to the development of a new branch of chemical 
industry, and to a large volume production of high-density and linear low-density 
polyethylene, isotactic polypropylene, ethylene-propylene rubbers, isotactic poly-
I-butene, and poly-4-methyl-l-pentene. These discoveries merited the Nobel prize, 
which was awarded to K. Ziegler and G. Natta in 1963. 
The initial works of Ziegler and Natta were followed by an "explosion" of 
scientific papers and patents covering all aspects of polymerization chemistry, 
catalyst synthesis, and polymerization kinetics as well as the structural, chemical, 
physical, and technological characteristics of stereo regular polyolefins, polydienes, 
and olefin copolymers. It is sufficient to say that in the twenty-five years after the 
first publications more than 15,000 papers and patents appeared on subjects related 
to the area. 
. 
The development brought about the establishment of several prominent groups 
of scientists occupied with the study of olefin polymerization. The most important 
of these were scientific schools in Italy, Germany, England, the United States, 
Japan, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Venezuela. In addition, many major 
chemical and petrochemical corporations throughout the world established labora-
tories devoted to the development of the technology of catalyst synthesis and olefin 
polymerization. 
The number of publications on the subject reached a maximum in the early 
1960's, then started to decline, and gradually became very modest compared to such 
traditional fields of polymer chemistry as organic polymer synthesis or radical 
polymerization. On the other hand, the flux of patents dealing with new important 
catalysts and polymerization technologies continued. This meant that the impor-
tant "initial accumulation" period was over and the center of activity in the research 

V111 
Preface 
had shifted to industrial laboratories where important advances in the technological 
development of the catalytic processes were made. 
In the beginning of the 1980's a revival of academic interest and activity in olefin 
polymerization was inspired by the discovery by commercial firms of very active 
supported isospecific catalysts. Several special meetings on the subject (Italy, 1980; 
USA, 1981 and 1982) emphasized the lasting importance of research on isospecific 
polymerizations. 
In the past, several important books on the topic were published. The first of 
them, "Linear and Stereoregular Addition Polymers" by N.G. Gaylord and H. 
Mark (Wiley, 1959) described the first spectacular discoveries of olefin polymeri-
zation catalysts and polymer structure but, being written only a few years after the 
original publications, it was understandably narrow in scope and in the interpre-
tation of the available data. 
In 1972 Professor T. Keii presented the first unified kinetic scheme for propylene 
polymerization in his book "Kinetics of Ziegler-Natta Polymerization" (Kadan-
sha, 1972). A very thorough although nondiscriminative review of all existing data 
on the chemistry and kinetics of olefin polymerization was published in 1976 in 
Russian by N.M. Chirkov, P.E. Matkovsky, and F.S. Dyachkovsky: "Polymeriza-
tion with Complex Metalloorganic Compounds" (Khimia, 1976). Finally, J. Boor, 
Jr. published in 1979 a wide review of the area with the main emphasis on reaction 
chemistry in his book "Ziegler-Natta Catalysts and Polymerizations" (Academic 
Press). This book remains the most important source of information on the basics of 
olefin polymerization and catalyst composition. 
The area of Ziegler-Natta catalysis has always been the most demanding from 
the experimental point of view. The catalysts are very sensitive to virtually all 
chemical compounds and are easily poisoned. As a result, very stringent require-
ments of reagent purity and care in all manipulations with the catalysts and in the 
polymerization reactions themselves are mandatory for achieving experimental 
reproducibility and reliability. As Professor T. Keii once commented to the author 
of this book, Ziegler-Natta catalysis is one of the scientific areas where the repro-
duction of some experimental finding is as important as the finding itself. 
For this reason a significant effort was undertaken to compare critically experi-
mental data published by various authors and to find theoretical approaches which 
allow direct comparison of the results. These attempts were found to be quite 
fruitful. In many cases such comparisons, after some transformation of the data 
published by different authors (frequently unaware of other publications), were 
successful, thus adding greater validity to the results. In the cases where such 
comparisons could not bring about reconciliation of the data the problems were 
emphasized. 
The main purpose of this book is to describe how the centers of heterogeneous 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts polymerize olefins and why they do it stereospecifically. In 
other words, the author analyzes the two most important problems related to olefin 
polymerization: the existence of a special polymerization mechanism in the case of 
catalysis by organic derivatives of transition metals and the ability of the polymeri-
zation centers to order spatially growing polymer chains. For this reason the 
problems and experimental facts discussed in the book fall into the following

categories. Chapter I presents the kinetics of isospecific olefin polymerization. A 
unified kinetic scheme is developed and olefin reactivities in the polymerization 
reactions are compared. Chapter II discusses the formation and functioning of 
isospecific active centers. The principal chemical and kinetic characteristics of 
heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts are analyzed. Chapter III deals with iso-
specificity of heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts. A new concept of catalyst 
stereospecificity is presented and the main factors influencing the stereospecific 
characteristics of the catalysts are examined. Chapter IV analyzes polydispersity of 
the properties of active centers and discusses possible correlations between distri-
butions of active centers and various parameters: isospecificity, reactivity, etc. In 
Chapter V the mechanism of isospecific olefin polymerization is discussed. Existing 
mechanistic ideas are reviewed on the basis of the experimental data presented in the 
book. 
Preparation of this book was much facilitated by numerous discussions I held 
with scientists of many countries engaged in the study of olefin polymerization. I 
would like to express my sincere gratitude to all of them. I also wish to thank Gulf 
Research and Development Company for the permission to publish the book. 
Special thanks are expressed to Professor H.J. Harwood (Institute of Polymer 
Science, Akron, Ohio) who read the manuscript and made many useful suggestions.

Chapter I 
Kinetics of Olefin Polymerization with 
Heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta Catalysts 
Introduction 
The kinetics of any catalytic polymerization process, including olefin polymeriza-
tion with heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts, is essentially the overlap of three 
simultaneous events: the time-dependent change of catalyst activity (sometimes 
influenced by the monomer presence), kinetics of the polymerization process itself, 
and the time-dependent diffusion processes. 
The influence of diffusion processes on the overall polymerization kinetics is one 
of the most disputable problems of olefin polymerization. Obviously these pro-
cesses are a nuisance as far as mechanistic studies of olefin polymerization are 
concerned and can be avoided by application of catalysts of a relatively low activity, 
by maintaining low monomer concentration in the polymerization processes (es-
pecially when the monomers exhibit high reactivity, like ethylene or propylene), and 
by the study of the initial stages of polymerization processes. 
Separation of the first two time-dependent events, the polymerization process 
itself and the change in catalyst activity with time, is a more difficult problem. These 
two processes are usually strongly interwoven both in time and by their nature. For 
example, deactivation of polymerization centers is one of the termination reactions 
in the polymerization reaction scheme. The simplest way to avoid the interference of 
these two processes is to use stable systems of relatively low activity such as all 
catalytic systems containing unground iX-TiCI3 , VCl3 at relatively low tempera-
tures, and such commercial catalysts as J-TiCI3-AlEt2Cl. For this reason, most of 
the information presented in this chapter is related to these stable heterogeneous 
systems; whereas the reasons for the high activity and instability of modern catalytic 
systems are discussed in the next chapter. 
A few comments about the experimental conditions of olefin polymerization 
with heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts which are adopted by the majority of 
research workers for laboratory studies follow. In the vast majority of cases the 

2 
I: Kinetics of Olefin Polymerization with Heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta Catalysts 
polymerization runs are carried out in glass at low (usually constant) monomer 
pressure or in stainless steel autoclaves at increased pressure. Vigorous stirring is 
always applied to avoid diffusion retardation of polymerization. 
There are two main types of experimental conditions with respect to monomer 
concentration: 
(i) A gaseous monomer (ethylene, propylene, I-butene) is fed into a stirred suspen-
sion of a solid catalyst in an inert medium (preferentially saturated linear 
hydrocarbons, i.e., n-heptane) at constant pressure. This allows one to maintain 
a constant monomer concentration in solution. 
(ii) The polymerization reaction is carried out in pure liquid monomer or in its 
mixture with a saturated hydrocarbon, for example, a propane-propylene 
mixture. The total pressure over the liquid phase in such experiments depends 
on the monomer boiling point. The polymer formed in such runs usually is not 
soluble in the reaction medium 1 and the monomer concentration during the run 
is constant (when undiluted liquid monomer is used) or nearly constant (when 
mixtures rich in monomer are used). 
In the last variant, a special calculation technique [1] has been applied to 
make allowance for the gradual decrease of monomer concentration during a 
run. These two experimental procedures at constant monomer concentration 
make it possible to avoid the "conversion-time" dependencies typical for 
studies of the free radical or ionic vinyl polymerizations in closed systems in a 
liquid monomer medium or in solution. 
The main macro kinetic parameters used in this book are: 
Polymerization rate R: moles or grams of monomer converted to polymer during 
some period of time (i.e., mol/min, g/h, etc.) 
Specific polymerization rate Rs: moles or grams of monomer converted to poly-
mer during some period of time per unit amount G(mol, g) of a heterog-
eneous catalyst; Rs = R/G (i.e., mol/mol catalystÂ· h or gig catalystÂ· h) 
Effective rate constant kerr: kerr = Rs/CM where CM is the concentration 
(mol/liter) of monomer in solution. The usual dimension of kerr is 
liter/gÂ· min. Neither Rs nor kerr depends on the liquid phase volume. 
Corresponding integral parameters are: 
Polymer yield Q(T): Q(T) = J6 Rdt (mol, g) 
Specific polymer yield Qs: Qs = J6 Rsdt (mol/mol, gig, g/mmol, etc.), where Tis 
the polymerization run duration. 
Monomer concentration in solution in the case of ethylene and propylene 
polymerization in a hydrocarbon medium is usually calculated by application of the 
Henry equation: 
1 Some of the exceptions: poly-I-butene is partially soluble in liquid I-butene at elevated temperatures; 
the same is true for polymers of many higher linear alpha-olefins.

(I-I) 
where PM is the monomer pressure (atm) over the solution, KJ:Â· exp(E/RT) is the 
Henry constant at temperature T (molfliterÂ· atm), and E is an empirical parameter 
(cal/mol) describing dependence of KH on temperature. Some important values of 
KJ: and E for ethylene and propylene are: 
Ethylene-heptane: KJ: = 1.15 X 10-3 mol/literÂ· atm, E = 2700 cal/mol [2]

[author's data] 
Apparent information on ethylene and propylene solubility in aliphatic and aroma-
tic hydrocarbons can be found also in Refs. [7, 8]. 
Until ca. ten years ago molecular weights of polyolefins were usually measured 
by the viscosimetric method and were calculated by use of the Mark-Houwink 
equation: 
[11] = kM~ 
(1-2) 
where ['1] is the intrinsic viscosity of the polyolefin solution, Mv the viscosimetric 
average molecular weight (corresponds approximately to the weight average mole-
cular weight Mw), and k and Q( are empirical constants estimated by appropriate 
calibration procedures. A list of k and Q( values for different polyolefins is presented 
in Table I-I. Unfortunately the precision of the Mv estimation from viscosimetric 
data is not high: sometimes even the estimations for the same polymer sample from 
intrinsic viscosities measured under different conditions can differ by as much as a 
factor of three. This is especially true for the high molecular weight polymers (Mw 
= 5 x 105-1 X 106) that are typically obtained in polymerization reactions con-
ducted in the absence of special chain transfer agents. Low precision of molecular 
weight estimates is the main reason for the low precision in calculated elementary 
polymerization constants (Section I-2-c) and their ratios (Section I-2-a). Presently, a 
more precise method of molecular weight estimation is used, based on the gel 
permeation chromatography (GPC) technique, which allows the simultaneous 
measurement of both the number average molecular weight Mn and the weight 
average molecular weight Mw. 
In the GPC method, dilute solutions of polyolefins are pumped through a series of 
columns containing a polymer gel. Polymer molecules are separated by the gel according to 
size. GPC is a powerful analytical technique. In principle it provides detailed information 
about the molecular weight distribution of polymers, which previously could be obtained 
only by tedious multiple extraction or precipitation methods. 
Virtually all polyolefins are insoluble at room temperature and require high temperature 
GP chromatographs. The only exception is isotactic polystyrene which remains in solution in 
toluene or xylenes at 20Â°C. As a rule, a-dichlorobenzene or 1,2,4-trichlorobenzne are used as 
solvents and the process is carried out at 11O-140Â°C.

GPC has no theoretical calibration procedure and depends on a series of standards for 
calibration, polymers with a very narrow molecular weight distribution of independently 
measured molecular weight. The most popular standards are samples of atactic polystyrene 
prepared by anionic polymerization. No high-quality standards for polyethylene and isotac-
tic polyolefins have been described in the literature. For this reason, calibration of the GPC 
method is usually based on the universal calibration principle [9, 10] according to which 
retention of polymer coils in the gel is determined by their hydrodynamic volume, which is 
proportional to the '1Mv product. 
The calibration procedure consists of two steps. First, a series of polystyrene standards is 
analyzed and the calibration curve for polystyrene is plotted as a function of the elution 
volume V of the chromatograph. Usually the curve is plotted in coordinates log M - Vand has 
a complex shape described by a polynomial 
Parameters of the equation, D~s, D~s, D~s, and D~s, are calculated with the application of 
various computer optimization procedures. In the second calibration step, a new calibration 
curve is calculated in the same coordinates but with a new set of D values which are estimated 
for a particular polyolefin (PO) as: 
where 
a = __ 
I _ log kps . b = cxps + I . 
cxpo + I 
kPO ' 
cxpo + 1 ' 
and k and cx are parameters of Eqn. 1-2 for polystyrene and the polyolefin measured in the 
same solvent and at the same temperature. These values for polystyrene, polyethylene, and 
polypropylene in o-dichlorobenzene solutions are presented in Table I-I.

The comparison of numerous kinetic data on olefin polymerization provides the 
possibility to make the following classification of the typical kinetic curves in 
coordinates "rate-time" and "yield-time"--see Fig. 1-1. The simplest variant of 
the kinetic curve corresponds to a constant or nearly constant polymerization rate 
throughout a run. Two examples of such kinetic curves are presented in Fig. 1-2 
for propylene polymerization with the 
IX-TiC12-AlEt3 system [42] in the

merization with the (X-TiCI3-AlEt1CI system in n-heptane at 60Â°C (curve 3) [43]. 
Similar dependences were found also for l-pentene polymerization with the (X-
TiC13-AlEt3 system in liquid monomer at 70Â°C [44], as well as for styrene [45, 46] 
and isoprene [46] polymerization. These kinetic curves can be usually obtained in 
polymerization experiments even at relatively high temperature, 60-80Â°C, and at 
high Cm if moderately active and stable systems are used. 
The second type of kinetic polymerization curves in Fig. 1-1 differs from the first 
type by the existence of a clearly pronounced acceleration stage which can last from 
a few minutes to a few hours. After the end of the acceleration stage the polymeri-
zation rate remains constant for a significant period of time. Such kinetic curves are 
very characteristic for olefin polymerization with many stable catalytic systems at 
low temperatures (20-50Â°C) and at low Cm. Several examples of such kinetic 
behavior can be found in literature for ethylene polymerization [15, 47], propylene 
polymerization [48-52], polymerization of 4-methyl-I-pentene [43,53,54] (see Fig. 
1-3), vinylcyclohexane [55], etc. Other examples of kinetic curves of this type are

presented later in Section 2-b where the kinetic explanation for the acceleration 
stage is given. 
The third type of kinetic curves presented in Fig. 1-1 (the decay type kinetic curve 
according to the classification given in Ref. [15]) is typical for olefin polymerizations 
with highly active Ziegler-Natta catalysts, especially with commercial ()-TiCl3 â¢ 0.33 
AICl3 and with supported catalysts at high Cm and relatively high temperatures. 
Several such curves are presented in Fig. 1-4 for propylene polymerization with 
different catalytic systems containing TiCl3 of different origin [56]. Similar data for 
styrene polymerization [57] are presented in Fig. 1-5. The extent of the decrease in 
activity depends on the catalytic system and on temperature. In some cases it does 
not exceed 30-50% (see Fig. 1-4) but for some supported catalysts the activity can 
fall by a factor of 3-5 during the first 30-60 minutes [58]. 
The fourth type of kinetic curves presented in Fig. 1-1 is in effect a combination of 
the curves of the second and the third type: the polymerization rate increases with 
time, reaches a maximum, and then gradually decreases. Many kinetic curves for 
this type of olefin polymerization can be found in Ref. [15] and throughout Chapters 
I and II of this book. Such dependencies are usually typical for olefin polymeri-
zation at low Cm in the presence of highly active catalytic systems, especially at low 
temperatures. The reasons for the activity decrease are discussed in Section 11-7. 
In spite of the wide variation in the kinetic behavior presented in Fig. 1-1 and in

the catalytic activity, all heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts have similar chem-
ical composition (see Chapter II), produce isotactic polyolefins (see Chapter III), 
and most probably contain identical or very similar active centers. For this reason 
the complex overall polymerization kinetics exhibited by some catalysts (especially 
the highly active ones) and represented by curves 3 and 4 in Fig. 1-1 can be regarded 
as a manifestation of changes in active center concentration with time. Numerous 
catalyst aging experiments have shown that this change practically does not depend 
on the presence of monomer in the reaction medium. Some of these experiments are 
discussed in Chapter II. 
On the other hand, the existence of stable catalytic systems (curves 1 and 2 in 
Fig. I-I) represents an evident advantage from the point of view of polymeriza-
tion kinetics. These examples show that the active centers of heterogeneous 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts are potentially extremely stable. The duration of the 
stationary stage in these processes (immediately after the monomer admittance, as 
in curve 1 in Fig. I-I, or after the completion of the acceleration step, as in curve 2) 
can be very long, up to 30 h even at 70Â°C [48]. If one takes into account that the mean 
duration of the polymer molecule growth under these conditions is not longer than 
10 min (see later, Section 1-3) it is evident that every active center during such runs 
can produce up to several hundred polymer chains with Mn ~ 1-1.5 x 105, i.e., the 
active centers of heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts are real catalytic centers not 
only with respect to the transformation of monomer to polymer but also with 
respect to polymer molecule formation. 
Additional evidence for the high stability of the active centers of heterogeneous 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts is provided by numerous experiments in which monomer is 
removed from a reaction vessel. The first such experiment [48] (see Fig. 1-6) 
demonstrated that the active centers are potentially stable for a long time in the 
absence of monomer and that after the readmittance of the monomer (or 
admittance of some other monomer) they can produce polymer at a virtually un-
changed rate. Several similar experiments are discussed in Chapter II. 
The active centers have been shown to be stable at temperatures up to 80Â°C.

Figure 1-7 shows the rate of ethylene polymerization with two catalytic systems, 0-
TiC13-AlEt3 and o-TiCI3-Ali-Bu3, in experiments where the temperature was 
changed several times during a single run [59, 60]. The activity level after the third 
temperature jump to 80Â°C was approximately the same as at the beginning of the 
run, which demonstrates good reversibility of the polymerization process. Similar 
data exist for ethylene polymerization with the 0-TiCI3-AlEt2CI system [15] and for 
propylene polymerization with various catalytic systems based on TiCl3 [60, 61]. 
Numerous studies of the change of polyolefin molecular weight with time re-
vealed two different types of behavior, schematically presented in Fig. 1-8. In the 
first case molecular weight increases for some period of time and then becomes 
constant. Such dependencies were found for ethylene polymerization with the y-
TiCI3-AlEt2CI catalyst [47], propylene polymerization with the oc-TiCI3-AlEt3 
system [48] (see Fig. 1-9) and with the VCI3- Ali-Bu3 system [56], as well as for linear 
olefins [62, 63], styrene [57] (see Fig. 1-5), etc. This situation can be regarded as 
intermediate between radical polymerization under stationary conditions, where 
polymer molecular weight virtually does not depend on time, and anionic poly-
merization in the absence of transfer agents, where polymer molecular weight 
increases linearly with time ("living chain" conditions). The duration of the first 
stage of the polymerization process in Fig. 1-8 depends strongly on the polymeriza-
tion temperature and Cm â¢ 
When the process is carried out at relatively low temperatures, as in Fig. 1-9, the 
molecular weight growth can be observed even for a few hours. On the other hand, if 
the polymerization process is carried out at relatively high temperatures (for 
example, 70-80Â°C) and at high Cm the stage of the molecular weight independence 
on time can be reached early in a run [64]. This independence means that the 
reaction rates of chain initiation and chain termination are equal, a situation 
formally similar to the stationary state in radical polymerization. 
The second typical variant of the "molecular weight-time" dependence pres-
ented in Fig. 1-8 (curve 2) is characterized by the absence of the "leveling-off" 
phenomenon typical for the first case. Polymer molecular weight continues to grow 
during the duration of the polymerization but the rate of this increase diminishes 
with time. This behavior is typical for ethylene polymerization [65], propylene 
polymerization [65-67] (see Fig. 1-10), and for 4-methyl-l-pentene polymerization

[43] with the ~-TiCI3-AIEt2CI system. Such dependencies can be explained in 
principle as a particular case of the general dependence represented by curve 1 in 
Fig. 1-8 if one considers that the duration of these experiments was not long enough 
for the polymerization process to reach an equilibrium between chain initiation and 
termination reactions. The experimental data discussed in Sections 1-2 and 1-3 
confirm this suggestion. 
Thus, in spite of the variety of heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts and a 
significant diversity of their kinetic behavior (Fig. 1-1), it is evident that the existence 
of stable catalytic systems gives one the possibility to separate two overlapping 
phenomena, the polymerization reaction itself and the catalyst activity change in 
time, and to investigate the principal kinetic dependencies of the polymerization 
process: the dependence of the polymerization rate and the molecular weight of a 
polymer on such variables as Cm' CCat' temperature, etc. The next step in such a 
study is the development of a phenomenological kinetic scheme of olefin polymeri-
zation in the same manner as is usually done in the case of radical and ionic 
polymerizations. This approach makes it possible (by the application of generally 
used procedures) to estimate such important kinetic parameters of the olefin poly-
merization reaction as the values of initiation, propagation, and transfer rate 
constants, their temperature dependencies, propagation rate constants in copoly-
merization reactions, etc. These data allow one to compare the reactivities of 
various olefins in homopolymerization and copolymerization reactions and to find 
the correlations between these kinetic parameters and the electronic and steric 
characteristics of the substituents at the olefin double bond. 

14 
I: Kinetics of Olefin Polymerization with Heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta Catalysts 
1-2. 
Phenomenological Kinetic Scheme of Olefin Polymerization 
To elucidate this scheme one has to examine the dependence of two principal 
polymerization characteristics, the rate of polymerization, R or R., and the molec-
ular weight of the polymer, Mm on the duration of the polymerization reaction T 
and on the reaction variables, the monomer concentration em and the concentra-
tions of the catalyst components. 
The time dependences of Rand Mn were discussed in the previous section. They 
showed that at least in some cases the number of active centers in a given amount of 
a catalyst is constant throughout a run, from the beginning of the polymerization 
process or after the end ofthe acceleration stage. It is obvious that these examples of 
isospecific olefin polymerization are the easiest to interpret and to describe quant-
itatively. For this reason the subsequent presentation is subdivided into three 
sections. In Section 1-2-a the cases of stationary polymerization processes are 
examined and the reaction scheme is presented. Section 1-2-b deals with the origin 
and kinetic description of the initial acceleration stage (curve 2 in Fig. 1-1) and 
Section 1-2-c contains some kinetic dependencies for the most general behavior 
of these reactions including both acceleration and deactivation stages (curve 4 in 
Fig. 1-1). 
1-2-a. Stationary Polymerization Process 
Reaction Rate. Numerous data demonstrate that in the case of stable catalytic 
systems polymerization activity of a given catalyst sample is always proportional to 
the amount of the solid component (transition metal halide). Such dependence can 
be easily envisaged if one takes into account that chemical interactions between the 
active centers on the surface of any heterogeneous catalyst are hardly possible (with 
the exception of some closest neighbors). The prolonged stability of these systems 
by itself can be regarded as proof that the inter-site interactions in these catalysts are 
negligibly small. Experimental data confirming the first-order dependence of R on 
the amount of transition metal halide can be found practically in every article 
dealing with olefin polymerization kinetics (see, for example, books [15, 68, 69] and 
reviews [48, 52, 70]. 
Generally the dependence of Rand R. on the concentration of a co-catalyst 
(organometallic compound MRx is more complicated. This problem is discussed in 
detail in Section 11-4 in connection with the problems of catalyst formation and 
functioning. Fortunately, it was found in many cases of stable heterogeneous 
catalysts that when1the organometallic compound concentration in solution is high 
enough and the molar [MRx] : [TiCI3 ] or [MRJ : [VCI3 ] ratio is higher than 0.5-1, 
R is not influenced by the co-catalyst concentration [45, 46, 48, 62, 71-76]. 
The dependence of R on em is the most important characteristic of any poly-
merization process. Numerous studies definitely have demonstrated the first-order 
dependence of R (or R.) on em over a very broad monomer concentration range. 
The proportionality between R (R.) and em was shown for all monomers studied: 
ethylene [47, 77, 78], propylene [48,52,79-83,203], I-butene [72], I-pentene [74], 1-
hexene [62], 3-methyl-l-butene [44], 4-methyl-l-pentene [43, 75, 76], styrene [45, 46,

"leveling-off" in the linear dependence of R on em was noticed even at the highest 
em up to pure liquid monomer media, i.e., usually no transition from first-order to 
zero-order dependence of R on em takes place. This finding has a considerable 
significance for the elucidation of the olefin polymerization scheme. Only recently 
the first example of a zero reaction order with respect to em was reported for styrene 
polymerization with the VCI3-Ali-Bu3 system, noticeable at low temperature 
(30Â°C) and at em ca. 2 mol/liter [85]. 
On the other hand, when the monomer concentration was significantly decreased 
the dependence of R (or R.) on em sometimes increased gradually from first order to 
second order (see Fig. 1-11). This phenomenon was observed for propylene [52, 70, 
79], 4-methyl-l-pentene [86], and vinylcyclohexane [55] and was explained as the 
manifestation of the slow initiation step in the polymerization scheme (see further). 
Molecular Weight. 
The most typical molecular weight-time dependence in the 
case of stable heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts is presented in Fig. 1-8 (curve 
1). Experimental data show that the speed with which M n increases with time during 
the initial polymerization stage is mainly determined by em. This period can be 
regarded in the first approximation as a period of "quasi-living" chain growth, 
because in the beginning of a polymerization reaction the molecular weight of a 
polymer frequently grows linearly with time. The situation is complicated by the 
fact that this process usually coincides in time with the increase of the polymeri-
zation rate (Fig. 1-1, curve 2). The overlap of these two processes is examined 
quantitatively in Section 1-3. When the M -t dependence shown in Fig. 1-8 levels off, 
the stationary value of M n at a given temperature (provided that no special chain 
transfer agent has been added to the system) depends mainly on one system variable, 
the organometallic compound concentration. This implies two principal chain 
transfer reactions: transfer to the organometallic compound (the increase of its 
concentration results in a decrease in M n) and transfer to monomer. If no transfer to 
monomer takes place, the stationary polymer molecular weight would increase with 
increase in em.

I: Kinetics of Olefin Polymerization with Heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta Catalysts 
The Simplest Polymerization Scheme. 
The following polymerization scheme was 
developed for the case of stationary heterogeneous catalysts of relatively low 
activity which are characterized by the polymerization kinetic curves 1 or 2 in Fig. 
1-1. The scheme is based on the principal assumption that the total amount of active 
centers in the systems, Co, remains constant throughout the polymerization 
experiment. 
Following Refs. [59,70,79,82], Co consists of two different parts, the amount of 
propagation centers Cp on which the propagation reaction takes place in a parti-
cular moment of time and the sum of the amounts of different initiation centers 
Li Ci on which an initiation reaction takes place in that particular moment. 
Cp + L Ci = Co 
(const.) 
i 
The initiation reaction is assumed to be the addition of the first monomer 
molecule (M) to an active center Cati 
Initiation reaction:Cati + M ~ 
Cat-Polymer (v = 1) 
(1-3) 
(Cat-Polymer-a propagation center, v-the polymerization degree of a chain). 
The assumption of monomer participation in the initiation reaction is based on 
the experimental finding [52, 72] that the duration of the acceleration period varies 
inversely with Cm (see details in Section 1-2-b). This definition of the initiation 
reaction is similar to those used in the kinetic schemes for anionic and cationic 
polymerizations. At the beginning of a polymerization process, all initiation centers 
have similar characteristics and one can use a single symbol Cati (and concentration 
C;) but during the course of the polymerization process different chain transfer 
reactions occur and new initiation centers appear in the system with characteristics 
which, in principle, can differ from those of the initial Cati (see later in this section). 
The chain propagation reaction is the addition of a monomer molecule to a 
propagation center Cat-Polymer: 
Propagation reaction: Cat-Polymer (v) + M ~ 
Cat-Polymer (v + 1) 
(1-4) 
In the phenomenological polymerization scheme, all propagation centers are 
assumed equally active, independently of their location on the catalyst surface and 
of the polymerization degree v of the chain they bear. Although the independence of 
the center activity on v is generally accepted (the only exception is Ref. [87]), the 
assumption that all centers of a given catalyst sample have equal activity (i.e., the 
same kp ) is usually not true. As is discussed in Chapter IV, all heterogeneous 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts exhibit a rather broad distribution of their propagation 
centers with respect to kp â¢ For this reason all characteristics of Cat - Polymer (as well 
as those of Cat;) discussed in this chapter are, in effect, some average values. 
Chain Termination Reactions. 
Usually three reactions of polymer chain termin-
ation are considered in the case of isospecific olefin polymerization-if no special 
chain transfer agent is added to the polymerization system. The formulation of these 
three reactions is based on a large volume of experimental data which is discussed 

1-2: Phenomenological Kinetic Scheme of Olefin Polymerization 
17 
later in this section. As soon as the catalyst activity remains constant for a consider-
able time, all these reactions from the kinetic point of view are transfer reactions, 
i.e., they result in the regeneration of Cat; or even Cat-Polymer [79]: 
Transfer with a monomer: 
k:' 
Cat-Polymer (v) + M -
Cat; + Polymer (v) 
(1-5) 
Transfer with an organometallic compound: 
k!"R 
Cat-Polymer (v) + MRx ~ 
Cat;' + Polymer-MRx_1 
(1-6) 
Experimental data show that organometallic compounds participate in this reaction 
in monomeric form [88,89], i.e., the order (IX) of this reaction with respect to the 
concentration of the organometallic compound MRx (CMR) is 0.5 for AlEt3, 
AlEtzCl, AlEtzl, and BeEtz (these substances are dimeric in solution) and 1 in the 
case of monomeric Ali-Bu3 and ZnEtz' 
Spontaneous chain transfer: Cat-Polymer (v) ~ 
Cat;" + Polymer (v) 
(1-7) 
Three new initiation centers formed in reactions 1-5-1-7 have different chemical 
structures (see also Section III-I). For example, if propylene polymerization is 
carried out with MRx = AlEt3 or AlEtzCl, the schematic structures of these initi-
ation centers are: 
Catt = Cat-H 
where "Cat" stands for some catalytic center. It is conceivable that the initiation 
reactions involving these different initiation centers may proceed with different k;s. 
In some papers a fourth chain transfer reaction is considered involvil1g the 
transition metal halide. It manifests itself in a decrease in Mn with increase in the 
catalyst concentration [48,54,79,90-92]. The most probable source of this chain 
transfer process is some unidentified soluble impurity in the transition metal halide 
(for example, TiC14 in TiC13). 
If we are interested in the stationary polymerization process, only the steady-
state condition with respect to the concentration (Cp) of propagation centers 
dCp = 0 
dt 
has to be considered, i.e., the initial acceleration process can be neglected. 
(1-8) 
The condition ofEqn. 1-8 corresponds to the equality ofthe sums of the initiation 
and chain transfer reaction rates: 

18

L Rinitiation = L Rtransfer 
(1-9) 
j 
j 
Following Refs. [79, 82], the existence of the general equality 1-9 implies the 
existence of three detailed equalities corresponding to the three transfer reactions 
1-5,1-6, and 1-7, and the three initiation reactions that follow these transfer reac-
tions (general equation is Eqn. 1-3): 
(1-10) 
where CMR is the concentration of an organometallic compound. 
Combining Eqns. 1-2 and 1-10, one obtains the following expression for Cp 
(I-11) 
It is evident that in the case of any polymerization reaction the overwhelming 
fraction of the total monomer consumed in the polymerization reaction is that spent 
in the propagation reaction ofEqn. 1-4. In such a case, the rate of polymerization, R, 
is (from Eqn. 1-11) 
k 
kp Co C;;, 
R = 
pCpCm = Cm + (JC:'Cm/ki) + (kr;'RGtR/kD + (k?/k'[) 
(I-12) 
When the molecular weight of a polymer does not change in time (as in Fig. 1-8, 
curve 1), the expression for v (using Eqns. 1-10) is 
(I-13) 
These two equations, 1-12 and 1-13, describe the principal features of stationary 
olefin polymerization with stable heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts. 
When Cm is sufficiently high the following modifications of Eqns. 1-11-1-13 can 
be made: 
(i) The denominator in Eqn. 1-11 can be reduced to 1 + (k';'/k;) and 
(I-14) 
i.e., the concentration of the propagation centers does not depend on Cm and, if 
the assumption k; ~ kp Â» JC:' [79,88] is valid,

i.e., at high Cm virtually all active centers exist as propagation centers. 
(ii) The denominator in Eqn. 1-12 can be reduced to Cm + (k';'Cmlkl) and

i.e., the polymerization rate is proportional to Cm and to the amount of the 
heterogeneous catalyst Co (which is proportional to the catalyst weight G) [48].

i.e., at sufficiently high Cm the molecular weight of the polymer formed in a 
stationary process should not depend on any polymerization variable. 
The treatment of the experimental data with the application of Eqns. 1-12 
and 1-13 gives one the possibility to estimate many important characteristics of 
olefin polymerizations. For example, if the reciprocal of Eqn. 1-13 is used 
(1-17) 
a plot of 1 Iv versus 1 I Cm for polymers prepared at constant CMR should be a straight 
line having k';'lkp as the intercept and ~RG.tRlkp + /c"P/kp as the slope. Similarly, 
when 1 Iv is plotted versus G.tR for polymerization dat~ obtained at constant Cm, a 
straight line will result havingk';'lkp + k';P/kpCm as the intercept and k~RlkpCm as the 
slope, which gives one the possibility to estimate all ktlkp ratios. One example of 
such linearization of the experimental data for propylene polymerization with the 
VC13-Ali-Bu3 catalytic system is presented in Fig. 1-12 [52]. Table 1-2 contains some

representative data on k':'/kp in the case of olefin polymerization with different 
heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts and Table 1-3 contains data for ~/kp and 
14P/kp- It is obvious that the precision of such estimations is determined by two 
requirements: 
(i) The application of Eqn. 1-13 is justified only in the case of a stationary 
polymerization process (with kinetic curves such as 1 and 2 in Fig. I-I) and only 
when the polymer molecular weight does not change with time (as in Fig. 1-8, 
curve 1). 
(ii) The estimations are based on the value of the degree of polymerization v (Le., 
the number average molecular weight Mn). Usually the molecular weight 
estimations are based on viscosity data (Eqn. I-I) and are close to Mw' 
Cases where Mw and Mw/ Mn ratios were measured simultaneously are relatively 
rare (they are marked a in Tables 1-2 and 1-3) and in all other cases Mw/Mn was 
assumed to be in the 5-10 range (see details in Chapter IV). If one takes into account 
that the precision of the Mw estimation from viscosity data is not high and that 
Mw/Mn varies significantly depending on the type of monomer, the type of a 
catalytic system, polymerization conditions, etc., it is evident that the precision 
of the kt/kp estimates given in Tables 1-2 and 1-3 is usually not better than Â± 100-
ISO%. 
The analysis of the data presented in Table 1-2 shows that the values of k':'/kp for 
propylene polymerization with all TiCI3-MRx systems (MRx does not contain 
halogen atoms) at 60-70Â°C are in a relatively narrow range (4-20) x 10-4 â¢ From 
the kinetic point of view these reactions, that of chain propagation (Reaction 1-4) 
and that of the transfer to monomer (Reaction I-S), are parallel processes involving 
the participation of the same reagents (an active center and a monomer molecule). 
The incidence of the propagation step is 2S00-S00 times more probable than that of 
the transfer reaction. Judging by Eqn. 1-16, the maximum molecular weight of 
polypropylene obtained at 70Â°C with cc-TiCI3-MRx catalytic systems has to be of 
the order Mw = 42 x (Mw/Mn)(kp/k':') ~ 2 x 105-S X 105 and cannot be exceeded 
at any monomer concentration or for any polymerization duration. The existence of 
this molecular weight limit in the case of polypropylene obtained with the cc-
TiC13-AlEt3 system at 70Â°C was confirmed experimentally. The intrinsic viscosity 
of such polymers (measured in tetralin at I3SÂ°C) never exceeds 3.2-3.S. 
However, the situation changes considerably when one studies a catalytic system 
such as <5-TiCI3-AlEt2Cl which also exhibits relatively stable kinetic behavior (see 
Figs. 1-3 and 1-4). Table 1-4 contains the data on propylene polymerization with this 
system. Analysis of these data in terms of Eqn. 1-17 gives (see Fig. 1-13) k':'/kp '" I.S 
x 10-5â¢2 This ratio is at least 30 times lower than that for the cc-TiCI3-AIEt3 
system. Some manifestations of this change in the probability of the transfer 
reaction are apparent: 
(i) the maximum molecular weight of polypropylene obtained with this catalyst is 
significantly higher and can reach I.S-2 x 106 â¢ 
2 The Mwl M. values (2.3-2.8) measured in Ref. [87] are substantially lower than the usual values (5-10). 
If the latter Mwl M. values are used for these calculations, k~ Ikp increases to 3-6 x 10-s.

(ii) the denominator ofEqn. 1-13 in this case cannot be reduced to k'('Cm (as in Eqn.

contribution to the total chain transfer process, even at high Cm in the absence 
of special chain transfer agents. 
The reaction of chain transfer with an organometallic compound was introduced 
in the polymerization scheme (Reaction 1-6) to take into account the well-known 
experimental fact that the molecular weight of polyolefins obtained in the stationary 
polymerization process decreases when the organometallic compound concentra-
tion increases. Two examples of this decrease are:

Such data give one the possibility to estimate ~R/kp as was discussed previously. 
These ratios for some typical heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts are presented 
in Table 1-3. It is necessary to mention that ~R values for the case of AlEt3, BeEt2, 
and AIEt2CI are effective ones and include the equilibrium constant for dissociation 
of these substances into their monomeric forms 
If one takes into account that the values of Kdiss for these organometallic com-
pounds in hydrocarbon solutions are very small (--2-4 X 10-4 [100]), the real 
reactivities of these substances in the chain transfer reaction are much higher than 
indicated in Table 1-3 and are of the same order of magnitude as the reactivity of 
ZnEt2. Thus, the well-known phenomenon of the high efficiency of ZnEt2 as a 
transfer agent in olefin polymerization reactions (see Table 1-3), is determined 
primarily by the absence of association in hydrocarbon solutions of ZnEt2 at 
increased temperatures rather than by the differences iii metal-carbon bond 
strength between ZnEt2 and AlEt3 as suggested in Ref. [88]. On the other hand, 
Ali-Bu3 has much lower real reactivity in this process, which is explained by the 
steric differences between the isobutyl and ethyl groups [60]. 
Spontaneous chain transfer (Reaction 1-7) is a relatively inefficient process for 
polymer chain termination as indicated by the ~P/kp values listed in Table 1-3. At 
the usual monomer and organometallic compound concentrations it can be 
neglected. 
As follows from Table 1-4, polypropylene samples obtained with the 
commercial system (j-TiCI3-AlEt2CI at high Cm have a very high molecular weight 
(> 106) and a low melt index. This falls beyond the range convenient for typical 
polymer processing techniques. For this reason, special chain transfer agents are 
usually added to the polymerization medium. The most important of these agents is 
H2. The chemical reaction involved is: 
k:' 
Cat-Polymer + H2 ---+ Cat-H + Polymer-H 
(1-18) 
To account for this chain transfer reaction, the additional term k~CH2 [47,101] or 
k~(CHyI2 [15, 48] should be added to the denominator of Eqn. 1-13. Hydrogen is a 
very effective chain transfer agent: k~/k'(' is of the order of 2 x 102 ([47], ethylene 
polymerization with the y-TiCI3-AlEt3 catalytic system at 40Â°C) to 2.5 X 103 

1-2: Phenomenological Kinetic Scheme of Olefin Polymerization 
25 
([101], propylene polymerization with the TiCI3-pyridine-AlEt3 system at 70Â°C). 
Addition of H2 to a polymerization medium usually is accompanied by a poly-
merization rate decrease due to the slow re-initiation reaction Cat-H + M 
-+ Cat-Polymer (v = 1) similar to the re-initiation after spontaneous chain termin-
ation. A detailed description of the effect of H2 on the olefin polymerization 
reaction with different heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts can be found in Refs. 
[15], [68], and [69]. 
One specific feature of the polymerization mechanism (Eqns. 1-3-1-7) discussed in this 
Section is that according to Eqn. 1-12 at low monomer concentration, when 
the rate of olefin polymerization has to depend on the second power of Cm. This was 
confirmed experimentally in the case of propylene and vinylcyclohexane polymerizations [52, 
55, 70, 79, 82]. The Cm range where the polymerization reaction order changes from first to 
second is < 0.1 mol/liter for propylene polymerization with the 0(-TiCl3-AlEt3 and 0(-
TiCl3-BeEt2 systems at 70 DC, <0.15 mol/liter for propylene polymerization with the 
VCl3-Ali-Bu3 system at 60Â°C, and < 0.8 mol/liter for vinylcyclohexane polymerization with 
the 0(-TiCl3-AlEt3 system. 
One of the most difficult problems in the study of olefin polymerization is the estimation 
of the initiation rate constants k;, k;', and kt. As can be seen from the Eqn.I-12, if ki is very 
small one expects that increase of the organometallic compound concentration will result in a 
decrease of the stationary polymerization rate. It was found experimentally, however, that an 
increase of the AlEt3, BeEt2, and AlEt3-ZnEt2 mixture concentration virtually does not 
influence the rate of propylene polymerization [48, 90-92]. Semiquantitative estimations 
show that ki for AlEt3, BeEt2, and ZnEt2 are of the same order as kp. Other estimations [82] 
give kp/k;' ~ 60-120 for the 0(-TiCl3-AlEt3 system in the presence ofZnEt2. When Ali-Bu3 is 
used a co-catalyst ki is 300 times (the 0(-TiCl3-Ali-Bu3 system [79]) to 9000 times (the 
VCl3-Ali-Bu3 system, [52, 99]) lower than kp. kt can, in principle, be estimated from the 
combination of the data on the dependence of CmGTiCl3/R on l/Cm and from the k;P/kp value 
but the precision of this estimation is low [79]. kt/kp is ca. 1400 for the 0(-TiCl3-BeEt2 system 
and ca. 560 for the 0(-TiCl3-AlEt3 system. As can be seen from the analysis ofEqn. 1-12, there 
is a 'priori no possibility for the estimation of k; from the kinetic data. In Ref. [79] the k;/kp 
ratio was assumed to be close to 1. 
I-2-b. 
Initial Acceleration Stage of the Polymerization Process 
Usually in Cm is not very high and if the temperature is in the range 20-40Â°C the 
polymerization kinetic curves exhibit an initial acceleration stage (see Fig. I-I, 
curves 2 and 4). The duration of this acceleration period '0 1/2 (or '03/4) is propor-
tional to the reciprocal of Cm [48, 61] 
(1-19) 
(where '01/2 corresponds to R = O.5Rstat and A is a constant).

The nature of the acceleration period was for a long time the subject of significant 
controversy. It was first proposed [48) that the origin of this phenomenon is the 
"grinding" of a catalyst (IX-TiCI3 or VCI3) by the growing polymer chains. This 
suggestion can in principle explain the dependencies shown by Eqn. 1-19: the higher 
Cm is, the higher R is and the shorter the period sufficient to pulverize initial catalyst 
particles to some final dispersion state. 
Attempts were made to prove this assumption and to eliminate the initial 
acceleration period by the mechanical grinding of 0I:-TiC13 samples [48). Such 
treatment indeed shortens the acceleration periods considerably (see Fig. 1-14) but it 
changes the catalyst behavior as well: the polymerization process becomes unstable 
which is quite uncharacteristic for the original 0I:-TiCI3-AlEt3 catalytic system. 
Moreover, the data presented in Fig. 1-14 show that mechanical grinding is sub-
stantially more effective than the proposed "grinding due to polymer formation": 
the maximal activity of both ground samples, however, short in duration, is nearly 
twice as high as Rstat of the unground samples. Subsequent thorough studies of 
catalyst grinding (see Sections 1I-1-b and 11-6) demonstrated that mechanical 
grinding always resulted in a substantial activation of these catalysts (at least 
temporary) which could not be reconciled with the suggestion of "grinding due to 
polymer formation" as the single explanation of the acceleration phenomenon. 
Another objection to the "grinding" explanation is related to the experimental 
observation that the relative activity of these catalysts (values of R/Cm or Rs/Cm) 
during the stationary state of the olefin polymerization is always practically inde-
pendent of Cm and the amount ofthe polyolefin formed. As R/Cm is proportional to 
Co (see Eqn. 1-15), which presumably increases with the catalyst grinding, it is 
dufficult to visualize some mechanical grinding process which always stops at the 

1-2: Phenomenological Kinetic Scheme of Olefin Polymerization 
27 
same level of crystal dispersion, independent of the amount of the "grinding agent," 
i.e., polymer. 3 
An alternative kinetic explanation of the initial acceleration stage was proposed 
in Ref. [15], [52], and [70]. The acceleration process was regarded as the manifes-
tation of some slow initiation reaction similar to those discussed in the preceding 
section: 
k!n 
Cati + M ~ 
Cat-Polymer (v = 1) 
(1-20) 
were kin corresponds to the "initial" initiation reaction and kin Â« kp â¢ If, following 
Ref. [15], one assumes that Cp = Co in the stationary state that follows the acceler-
ation period (see Eqn. 1-14-a), i.e., that Co = Ci + Cp , then the solution of the 
differential equation 
(I-21) 
gives: 
(1-22) 
and 
(1-23) 
which at t --. 00 coincides with Eqn. 1-15-a (the stationary stage). If, following Refs. 
[52] and [70], one assumes that all initiation reaction constants discussed in the 
previous section have the same value (k; = k;' = k'(,), equal to kin, i.e., that all 
initiation centers have equal reactivity regardless of their structure and the same 
initiation rate constant ki' then, taking into account reactions 1-20 (i.e., Eqn. 1-3) 
and transfer reactions 1-5, 1-6, and 1-7, the following differential equation can be 
written: 
(I-24) 
After integration of Eqn. 1-24 one obtains: 
(I-25) 
and 
3 In the case of highly active commercial t5-TiCl3 samples, olefin polymerization is indeed accompanied 
by a significant catalyst dispersion [102, 103] during the few first minutes of the process (not several hours 
as in Fig. 1-14). This phenomenon is discussed in Section 11-6.

which coincides with Eqn. 1-12 at t -T 00 (stationary stage) and if ki = kif = kt, 
Equation 1-26 was used for the evaluation of some important kinetic character-
istics of the polymerization process including k i , kp, and Co [52, 70, 104]. However, a 
comparison of Eqns. 1-23 and 1-26 with the shapes of the experimental kinetic 
curves reveals their inadequacy. Both these equations correspond to exponential 
"saturation" R versus t curves, typical for first-order reactions. On the other hand, 
the real acceleration curves usually have a different shape (see Fig. 1-15). At low 
temperatures they frequently exhibit a characteristic S-shape, whereas at 60Â° -70Â°C 
they usually have a quasi-linear form. The acceleration curves similar to those 
shown in Fig. 1-15 for the oc-TiCI3-AlEt3 system are quite typical. They have also 
been found in the case of the oc-TiCI3-BeEt2 system [90,91], pure TiCl2 [105], 
VCI3-Ali-Bu3 [52, 75, 76, 104], and VCI3-AlEt2CI [106]. Fig. 1-16 presents a 
comparison of two kinetic curves, the real curve of propylene polymerization with 
the catalytic system VCI3-Ali-Bu3 at 60Â°C [52, 104] and the curve corresponding 
to Eqns. 1-23 and 1-26. This curve was drawn to fit two experimental parameters: 
Rstat and the slope of the curve at t -T 00. These two curves obviously to not coincide. 
The shape of the polymerization kinetic curves in Figs. 1-15 and 1-16 suggests the 
existence of two consecutive reactions in the acceleration period: the reaction gen-
erating active centers (without monomer participation) and the initiation reaction

where kf is the rate constant of the center formation reaction. To use the reactions of 
Eqn. 1-27 for the description of the acceleration period, one has to make some 
assumptions about the values of the rate constants for the initiation reactions 
following transfer reactions 1-5 to 1-7. As was discussed in Section 1-2-a, according 
to the experimental data k'f values for the re-initiation reactions following chain 
transfer reactions with AlEt3 , BeEt2, and ZnEt2 are close to kp â¢ It also follows from 
Table 1-3 that the reaction of spontaneous chain termination is a very slow process 
and can be neglected in a fair approximation. In addition, it can be assumed 
(following Ref. [79]) that ki ~ kp â¢ In this case, the only important initiation reaction 
in a polymerization system is the "initial" reaction of chain initiation represented 
by the second reaction in Scheme 1-27. Thus, the acceleration polymerization stage 
can be represented by the following set of differential equations:

where Cs is the concentration of potential centers. If at t -+ 0, Cs -+ Co the solution of 
these equations gives:

and 
(1-30) 
where Rstat = kp Cm Co. 
Equation 1-30 correctly describes the shape of polymerization kinetic curves 
similar to those presented in Figs. I-IS and 1-16 and gives one the possibility to 
estimate k;n and kf by adjusting the calculated curves to the experimental ones. One 
example of such adjustment is presented in Fig. 1-17 where all experimental curves 
(the same as in Fig. I -IS) represent data on propylene polymerization at 70 and 56Â°C 
with the 0(-TiC13-AlEt3 catalytic system [48]. The values of kf and k;n for this 
catalytic system and for two other stable catalytic systems are given in Table 1-5. 
The kin and kr values for the 0(-TiCI3-AlEt3 system at 70Â°C make it possible to 
describe quantitatively the kinetic data for propylene polymerization at different 
monomer concentrations; see Fig. 1-18.4 The data for the dependence of kf on the 
polymerization reaction variables are scarce but, judging by data presented in Fig. 
1-17, this parameter is not influenced by CMR â¢ Possible chemical interpretations 
of the center formation reaction are discussed in Chapter II where interactions 
between the components of heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts are examined. 
All experimental data discussed previously in this Section were obtained with 
catalysts oflow activity, which are usually characterized by prolonged acceleration 
periods (see Figs. I-IS, 1-16, and 1-17). Recent experimental studies in this field are 
4Jt is evident from the analysis ofEqns. 1-29 and 1-30 that they can satisfactorily describe the initial quasi-
linear parts of the polymerization rate curves (see Figs. 1-17 and 1-18). On the other hand, it follows 
from Eqns. 1-29 and 1-30 that at t-+ 0 both Cp and R -+ 0, i.e., the calculated R versus t curves are always 
S-shaped and have a zero slope at very small t. The estimation of some "acceleration" parameters like R/t 
from the early stages of the polymerization curves (as was done in Refs. [IS, 52, 104)) has no kinetic 
meaning as far as the reaction scheme 1-27 is concerned.

usually carried out using highly active catalysts and at higher monomer con-
centrations. This prevents the detailed study of the shape of the acceleration curves. 
In these cases the acceleration phenomena are noticeable at low temperatures only 
(20-40Â°C) and are manifested by the appearence of "acceleration periods" such as 
those observed in the yield versus time plots in Fig. 1-1, curves 2 and 4. If precise 
estimation of polymerization kinetics is possible for a very short period of time after 
polymerization commencement (1-2 min), the acceleration effect can be discovered 
even for ethylene polymerization with commercial catalysts at very high tempera-
ture, 180Â°C [107]. 
If one applies the kinetic scheme of Eqn. 1-27 for the description of this effect the 
Q-t dependence is (using Eqn. 1-30):

It is necessary to note that some cases of acceleration processes cannot be described by the 
reaction scheme of Eqn. 1-27. These are processes of olefin polymerization at low tempera-
tures (see, for example, the data for 32Â° and 43Â°C in Fig. 1-15) and kinetic data for olefin 
polymerization with MeTiCl3-containing catalysts [108], which are characterized by very 
long S-shaped acceleration curves. Some of these curves can be described only by the reaction 
sequence: 
c. -+ C~' -+ C; 
( + M) -+ Cp 
or even by more complicated schemes. It is quite possible that the first steps in these reactions 
involve a removal of various catalytic poisons from the catalyst surface; see Section 11-5. The 
discussion of the change of polymer molecular weight during the acceleration stage of olefin 
polymerization is presented in Section 1-3. 
1-2-c. 
General Scheme of Olefin Polymerization 
As was discussed in Section I-I, many heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts are 
unstable. Their activity in olefin polymerization decreases either from the beginning 
of a polymerization process (curve 3 in Fig. I-I) or after the acceleration period 
(curve 4 in Fig. I-I). Such behavior is typical for many pre-milled catalysts (see, for 
example, Fig. 1-14), for catalysts containing c5-TiCI3, especially in combination with 
AlEt3 (Fig. 4), for VClrbased catalysts, and for many supported catalysts. 
Numerous experiments [15, 56, 109, 204] have demonstrated that usually this 
deactivation does not depend either on em (and hence the amount of the polymer 
formed) or on the presence of monomer itself in the reaction medium. It also does 
not depend on polymer solubility in a polymerization medium: in the case of the 
supported TiCI4/MgCl~ catalyst, the rates of deactivation were found to be similar 
both in propylene polymerization (insoluble polymer) and in I-decene polymeriza-
tion (soluble polymer) [110]. Thus the rate of catalyst deactivation can be regarded, 
to a first approximation, as some kinetic phenomenon which is independent of a 

34 
I: Kinetics of Olefin Polymerization with Heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta Catalysts 
polymerization process. For this reason, as far as the polymerization reaction is 
concerned, this decay can be attributed to some nonspecified chemical reaction 
without monomer participation. The only role this reaction plays in the phenomen-
ological polymerization scheme is that of a chain termination reaction: when a given 
polymerizaton center stops to polymerize olefin, the molecular weight of the poly-
mer chain it bears ceases to increase. 
Experimental data show that two different types of deactivation should be 
considered. If the polymerization reaction is carried out with TiCl3-based catalysts 
(see, for example, Fig. 1-4), the decrease of the catalytic activity usually never results 
in total catalyst deactivation. The decrease in catalyst activity levels off after 1-2 h. 
In such cases, following Ref. [15], the total amount of active centers Co in a catalyst 
can be divided into two parts. The first type of active center (amount Co. d remains 
stable throughout a run and is responsible for the catalyst activity at the final stages 
of the polymerization reaction. The second type of the active center (amount Coâ¢2 ) 
is unstable and is responsible for the apparent catalyst deactivation with time. 
Co. 2/( Co.l + Coâ¢2 ) = Co. 2/ Co is the parameter of catalyst instability. It depends on 
the polymerization conditions and on the type of catalyst and can be both very high, 
0.8-0.9 in the case of ethylene polymerization with the o-TiCI3-AlEt2Cl system 
[Ill], and rather low, 0.2-0.3, propylene polymerization with the oc-TiCI3-AlEt2Cl 
system [66] (see Fig. 1-4) and with supported catalysts [203]. It is usually assumed 
that both these types of active centers are characterized by the same kp-
Studies of the deactivation processes showed that in a first approximation they 
are not influenced by CMR [15]. The deactivation is a complex topochemical reaction. 
However, it can be reasonably well described as a first-order reaction [15, 56, 77, 78, 
109, 112] with some rate constant kd â¢ Attempts were made to describe deactivation 
as a second-order reaction [58, 113, 205], or as a mixed first- and second-order 
process [114] but because the real chemical nature of this reaction is not known (and 
most probably is different in different catalytic systems-see Section II-7), it seems 
appropriate to use the simplest first-order approximation in any further analysis. 
Thus the general reaction scheme for the olefin polymerization reaction is:

35 
The first two reactions in this scheme represent two consecutive initiation reac-
tions, analogous to the reactions of Eqn. 1-27. They are sufficient to describe the 
acceleration processes in olefin polymerization. The propagation reaction and the 
two principal chain transfer reactions are the same as in the case of the stationary 
polymerization process (Reactions 1-4, 1-5, and 1-6). The deactivation process of 
unstable centers is modeled as a first-order reaction with the participation of both 
propagation centers (amount Cp,2) and initiation centers (amount C;,2) to account 
for the apparent insensitivity of the deactivation process to the presence of mono-
mer in the reaction medium [109, 112, 115]. It can be seen that for stable centers 
(Co, 1, C;, 1, Cp,1) the reaction scheme is identical to that described in the previous 
Section (reactions of Eqn. 1-27). The corresponding expressions for the principal 
kinetic characteristics are: for Cp ,1' Eqn. 1-29; for R, Eqn. 1-30; and for the polymer 
yield, Eqn. 1-31.

Equations 1-39 are usually used for the description of polymerization kinetics in 
the case of the modern active catalysts at high monomer concentrations when all 
active center formation and "initial" initiation reactions are completed during the 
first few minutes of a polymerization process [15, 56, 107]. Table 1-7 contains some 
data on the values of Roo and kd for propylene polymerization with the TiCl3-AlEt3 
system at different temperatures. 

1-2: Phenomenological Kinetic Scheme of Olefin Polymerization 
37 
Figure 1-19 presents a comparison between precise experimental data for propy-
lene polymerization with a highly active unstable catalytic system (<5-TiCI3-AlEt3' 
taken from Ref. [15]) during the first six minutes of the polymerization reaction at 
57Â°C5 and the kinetic curve calculated by the application of Eqn. 1-38 with Co,l 
= 0.1, Co,2 = 0.2, kf = 0.5 min-I, kIn = 3.3 liter/mol' min, and kd = 0.25 min-l. 
The calculated curve was adjusted to match the experimental one by varying two 
parameters, Rmax and tmax ' A comparison ofrate constants with those in Table 1-5 
shows that both kf and kIn are much higher for this catalytic system than for the 0(-
TiCI3-AlEt3 system. Whereas the kf difference can be interpreted as the manifes-
tation of the differences in the interaction reactions of AlEt3 with 0(-TiCl3 and <5-
TiCl3 (see Section II-2, II-4, and II-7), the difference between kIn values is surprising 
and causes doubts about the simple chemical interpretation of this reaction as the 
first addition of monomer to the active center (Reaction 1-20). It can be suggested 
that this "initial" initiation reaction is in effect the last stage of the active center 
formation which proceeds with monomer participation.

It was discovered [52,70, 104] that the deactivation reaction for the VClr AIR3 catalytic 
systems (the reaction of VCI3 reduction) is first order with respect to both Cp and con-
centration of AIR3 and that Co,l = O. The modification of Eqns 1-36 (Coâ¢l = 0, kdCMRinstead 
of kd) results in the following expression for the polymerization rate for the VCI3-MRx 
system 
S The kinetic curve was obtained in the course of a polymerization run in which the 15-TiCl3 suspension in 
n-heptane was saturated with propylene and then AlEt3 was added to the system.

Figure 1-20 shows a comparison between the experimental polymerization curve (propyl-

and [104] and the curve calculated by the application of Eqn. 1-41 for kp Cm Co = 52.4 X 10-3 
liter/min' g (see Fig. 1-16), kf and kin from Table 1-5, and kd = 0.18liter/molÂ·min [104]. 
The complex expressions for R in the general phenomenological polymerization 
scheme (Eqns. 1-38 and 1-41) give one no possibility to estimate the rate constants 
involved (kin, kf' kd' kpCo) by the linearization procedures typical for classical chem-
ical kinetics. These parameters can be found by curve adjusting methods with the 
applicaton of the computer nonlinear least-squares methods [107]. On the other 
hand, if the polymerization process is carried out at high Cm and the maximum 
catalytic activity is reached early in the experiment (kinetic curve 3 in Fig. I-I), 
kd can be easily calculated from a plot of In(R - Roo) versus t by application of 
Eqn. 1-39 [15].

1-3. Molecular Weight Growth in the Beginning of a 
Polymerization Reaction and the Estimation of the 
Propagation Rate Constants 
1-3-a. General Description 
The initial period of olefin polymerization is often characterized by a gradual 
increase of the polymer molecular weight up to some constant value (see Fig. 1-8). 
This behavior is especially typical for olefin polymerization at moderate tempera-
tures (lower than 50Â°C) and at low Cm. It is frequently accompanied by the 
acceleration phenomena described in Section 1-2-b. This behavior is very much 
reminiscent of anionic polymerization behavior and is usually explained in a similar 
way, as the manifestation of a "quasi-living chain" mechanism. 
The standard quantitative procedure for the theatment of the experimental data 
on the molecular weight growth was discussed in Ref. [48]. The number average 
degree of polymerization v is expressed as 
_ 
Number of monomer molecules consumed in polymerization 
v = 
(1-42) 
Number of polymer molecules formed 
The numerator of Eqn. 1-42 is the polymer yield for some polymerizaton time T 
divided by the molecular weight of the monomer. The denominator of Eqn. 1-42 
consists of two terms: (a) the number of "dead" polymer chains terminated during 
time T in different chain termination reactions (Cterm) and (b) the number of 
polymer molecules which at time T are still in a stage of growth ("living chains"). 
This last number is equal to the number of polymerization centers (Cp) in the system 
at T. Taking into account general expressions for the polymer yield and the rate of 
chain termination, Eqn. 1-42 can be rewritten as: 
_ 
roT Rdt 
Q(T) 
JI 
v = Cp + Cterm = Cp + [T LR!dt 
Jo j 
(1-43) 
where the R! are the rates of different chain termination reactions (see Section 1-2-a). 
The simplest particular case of Eqn. 1-43 is when all its parameters, Cp , R, and R!, 
are invariant with time [48]. In this case Q = RT, f~LjR!T = LjR!T, and Eqn. 
1-43 can be reduced to: 
I 
Cp

i.e., a linear correlation should exist between l/Vand l/Twith slope Cp/R = l/kpCm

(see Eqn. 1-I5-a) and intercept LiR!/R = l/Voo (see Eqn. 1-16). Another widely used 
variant of Eqn. 1-44 is 
(1-45) 
which can be used for the Cp determination in stationary polymerization processes if 
the experimental data are plotted in coordinates Q(T)/Vversus Q(T) [52, 64, 77, 78, 
117] or Q(T)jV versus time [118]. An apparently good example of the application of 
Eqn. 1-45 is [77, 78] ethylene polymerization at 85Â°C with the very active supported 
catalyst (Mg(OEth-TiCI4) + AlEt3 â¢ It exhibits a practically constant polymeri-
zation rate from the beginning of the experiments up to one hour. These data are 
presented in Fig. 1-21. Mn values were calculated from Mw (viscosimetric estimation) 
and Mw/Mn (OPC data). The same approach was used for the study of propylene 
polymerization with the highly active supported TiCI4/MgCI2-AlEt3 and TiCI4/ 
MgCl2/ethyl benzoate-AlEt3/ethyl benzoate catalysts at 60Â°C [64, 119]. These 
catalysts are stable for the initial 100 s of reaction and polymer molecular weight 
(measured by OPC) grows during the first 15-20 s indicating a very high kp â¢ The 
average kp for the first system is in the 250-750 liter/molÂ· s range. However, the 
centers of the highest isospecificity (constituting,...., 10% of total Cp) exhibit also 
the highest activity: kp for them is 500-1500 liter/molÂ· s. Unfortunately, such an 
approach has only a limited application because, as was discussed in Sections 1-2-b 
and 1-2-c, the initial period of molecular weight growth usually coincides with the 
acceleration period when both Cp and R increase with time. 
A more general approach is based on the modification of the original Eqn. 1-43. 
Ifone takes into account that Cp at any moment Tcan be substituted by R(T)/kpCm 
(where R(T) is measured experimentally for this moment T) and that both Q(T) 

1-3: Molecular Weight Growth in the Beginning of a Polymerization Reaction 
41 
and Cterm have the same dependence on T, 6 Eqn. 1-43 can be rewritten as 
(1-46) 
where R(T), Q(T), and yare measured for the same time T, and Nis a constant for a 
particular set of polymerizaton conditions (l/N = y;"). It follows from Eqn. 1-46 
that the experimental data on the molecular weights at the beginning of polymeri-
zation can be linearized in a general case by plotting l/yversus R(T)/Q(T). Such a 
plot will have a slope of l/kpCm . 
An example of the application ofEqn. 1-46 is presented in Figs 1-22 and 1-23. The 
experimental data in Figs. 1-22(A) and 1-22(B) represent the principal kinetic 
dependencies of Q(T) and Mw on time for propylene polymerization with the J-
TiC13-AlEt2Cl system at 50Â°C [67]. Both these figures feature typical character-
istics of olefin polymerization as described by Scheme 1-35: the polymerization rate 
increases for the first 20 min and then slowly decreases due to catalyst deactivation 
while molecular weight increases with time for 60 min and then levels off due to 
chain transfer reactions. The crucial step in the estimation of kp from these data is 
the correct measurement ofY. The procedure includes two steps: calculation of Mw 
from polymer specific viscosity data and the experimental estimation of Mw/Mn. As 
was discussed previously, different authors use different parameters of the 
Mark-Houwink equation (Eqn. 1-2) for the calculation of Mw from ['I]-see Table 
1-1.7 In addition, the variation of Mw/Mn in the course of olefin polymerization was 
studied in only few cases [36,51,66,120, 121]. The lack of data for these values is one 
of the main sources of error in the kp estimations. In the following examples a typical 
Mw/Mn range of 5-10 was used for the estimation of y where experimental Mw/Mn 
values were absent. More details on Mw/Mn are given in Chapter IV. The precision 
of the kp estimation is not better than Â± 50% 
The results of the treatment of the experimental data shown in Figs. 1-22(A) and 
1-22(B) are presented in Fig. 1-23 in coordinates of Eqn. 1-46 and give kp ~ 3-6 
liter/molÂ·s. Two other examples of the application of Eqn. 1-46 are presented in 
Figs. 1-24 and 1-25. Experimental data in Fig. 1-24(A) are given for propylene 
polymerization with the highly active and highly unstable J-TiCI3-AlEt3 system at 
43Â°C and are taken from Ref. [15]. The treatment of these data in Fig. 1-24(B) gives 
6 The dependence of Q(T) on Tin a general case is given by Eqn. 1-40. According to the definition given 
above, Cte,m = sr'LR!dt. Here every particular term R, has a form klCpC{ where kl is the transfer or 
termination rate constant and C/ is the concentration of a transfer agent. The particular expressions are 
given by Eqns. 1-10. If the C/ are constant throughout a given experiment the integration of'LRfis in 
effect an integration ofthetype J6 C. dt, with the general expression for C. as in Eqn. 1-38. This integration 
gives the same Cte,m dependence on T as that for Q(T) in Eqn. 1-40:

all cases when ['1] was measured in decalin at 135Â°e.

Important Particular Cases 
Several particular cases illustrating the use of the general Eqn. 1-43 for kp estimation 
alternatively with Eqn. 1-46 are examined below. 
If the polymerization temperature is low, the values of the reaction constants of 
different chain transfer reactions in the reaction scheme ofEqn. 1-35 and the rate of 
catalyst deactivation can be so low that the chain termination processes occuring 
during a particular polymerization run can be neglected as a first approximation. It

Figure 1-25. Styrene polymerization with the a-TiCI3-AlEt3 system at 70Â°C. Experimental 
data of Fig. 1-5 in coordinates of Eqn. 1-46. 
Starting from this moment, Q(T) will change linearly with time (see Eqn. 1-31). v 
will also change linearly with time or with Q(T). An example of such a dependence 
for propylene polymerization with the i5-TiC13 - AlEt2 Cl system at 30Â°C is presented 
in Ref. [50]. Mn for the polypropylene samples were measured by the GPC method. 
The linear dependence between v and Q(T) for this polymerization is evident from 
Fig. 1-26(A). However, the treatment of the same experimental data in coordinates 
of Eqn. 1-46 (Fig. 1-26(B)) reveals that the straight line obtained does not go 
through the coordinate origin, i.e., that Cterm in Eqn. 1-43 is not equal to zero and 
some small but definite chain termination process occurs. Thus the existence of a 
linear correlation between vand Q(T) cannot be regarded as sufficient proof of the 
"living chain" polymerization mechanism implied by Eqn. 1-47 because a small 
curvature of the v-Q(T) dependence can be overlooked. kp for propylene poly-
merization at 30Â°C in this system as calculated from Fig. 1-26(B) is ca. 0.26 
liter/molÂ·s. 
A special warning should be given about the often practiced usage of the linear 
portions of the v-Q(T) plots for the calculations of Cp and kp â¢ The apparent reason 
for this procedure is the notion (see Ref. [81] as an example) that the linearity of the 
v-Q( T) plot is proof that the number of polymer molecules is constant in time and is 
equal to Cp , the number of polymerization centers. However, v is a cumulative 
quantity and, if the acceleration step of the polymerization reaction is long enough,

the calculation of Cp as AQ(T)/AMn [50, 81] from the linear part of the V-Q(T) 
dependence, instead of the application of the more general Eqn. 1-46, can result in a 
significant (by a factor of up to 2-3) overestimation of Cp and a corresponding 
underestimation of kp â¢ For example, the application of this linearization procedure 
to the data presented in Ref. [54] (Fig. 1-26(AÂ» gives kp -- 0.1 liter/molÂ· s instead of 
0.26 liter/mol' s from Fig. 1-26(B). 
When olefin polymerization is carried out at high Cm and at relatively high 
temperatures (50-70Â°C) the initiation steps in Scheme 1-35 are so rapid that the 
polymerization rate is constant (for stable systems) or decreases from the very 
beginning of the polymerization. If the polymerization reaction with these con-
ditions is studied for a very short period of time (e.g., a few minutes for unsupported 

1-3: Molecular Weight Growth in the Beginning of a Polymerization Reaction 
47 
catalysts, a few seconds for supported catalysts) Eqn. 1-44 can be used for the calcula-
tion of Cp and kp â¢ For these short polymerization durations the second term on the 
right side of Eqn. 1-44 is much smaller than the first one and the conditions typical 
for the uncomplicated variant of the "living chain" mechanism can be applied (see 
also Eqn. 1-15-a):

If one takes into account that the acceleration step in the polymerization reaction 
is not instantaneous and that some chain transfer reactions take place, even during 
short periods of time, it is obvious that this approach gives minimal possible values 
ofkp â¢ 
A few examples of the application of Eqn. 1-48 for the estimation of kp follow: 
(i) The following results were obtained for propylene polymerization with the {}-
TiCI3-AlEt2Cl system in propane-propylene mixtures at 70Â°C: Mw = 1.7 x lOs for T 
= 2 min and em = 6.3 mol/liter [56]. Assuming the typical Mw/Mn range for such 
polymers (ca. 5-10) one obtains kp ~ 0.5-1.0 liter/molÂ· s. 
(ii) If propylene is polymerized with the very active TiCI4/MgCI2-AlEt3 system its molec-
ular weight increases only during the few first seconds of the reaction [119]. When this 
reaction was carried out for 5 s at 40Â°C and em = 0.45 mol/liter polypropylene with Mw 
= 424,000 was obtained [122] which corresponds to kp ~ 500-1000 liter/molÂ· s for the 
same Mw/ Mn range. 
(iii) It was found that Mn of polypfopylene (measured by the GPC method) obtained with the 
soluble V(acach-AlEt2Clsystem'at -78Â°C increases linearly with time [123]. kp for this 
reaction is - 5 x 1O-3 Iiter/molÂ·s:Â· 
(iv) Polymerization of 4-methyl-l-pentene with the {}-TiCI3-AIEt2Cl system in heptane at 
60Â°C and em = 1.2 mol/liter produces polymer with Mn ~ 47,000 after 5 min of reaction 
and polymer with Mn ~ 135,000 after 10 min [43]. These results give a kp range for this 
reaction of 1.5-2.2 liter/molÂ· s. 
If olefin polymerization is carried out with highly active unstable catalysts like 
b-TiCI3-AlEt3 at relatively high temperatures (50-80Â°C) and at high Cm (1-7 
mol/liter), i.e., under conditions typical for the commercial application of these 
catalysts, the initial acceleration period is short and can be neglected but the process 
of catalyst deactivation is pronounced. Equation 1-48 can be used only for very 
short Tin such cases and for longer reaction times the following expressions should 
be used: Polymerization rate-Eqn. 1-39. Polymerization yield-Eqn. 1-40-a. 
Number of "live" polymer chains-Eqn. 1-39. Number of "dead" polymer chains

Circles are experimental data from Ref. [49]. Calculations (solid line) were carried out with 
Eqns. 1-39, 1-40-a, 1-44, and 1-49 for the following parameters: CO,l = CO,2' kp = 100, k;' = 
0.01, fGdR = O.oI (all in liter/molÂ· min), kd = 0.04 min-I, Cm = 1 mol/liter. 
This last equation was obtained by the integration of differential equations corre-
sponding to Scheme 1-35 in the case of very fast initiation steps. 
The example of the v-Q(T) dependence for this case was calculated with applica-
tion ofEqns. 1-44, 1-39, 1-40-a, and 1-49 and is compared in Fig. 1-27 with the experi-
mental v-Q(T) dependence for propylene polymerization with the o-TiCI3-
AlEt2CI system (experimental data are from Ref. [49]). This dependence is char-
acterized by a rapid initial growth ofv with Q(T) with the subsequent slow increase 
in v in the final stage of the polymerization reaction. Similar v-Q(T) depen-
dencies are presented in many papers dealing with olefin polymerization: ethylene 
[65, 111], propylene [62, 81, 87, 124, 125], and 4-methyl-l-pentene [43, 126]. In the 
case of highly active supported catalysts used at moderate temperatures the high 
rate of catalyst deactivation (kd can reach 1 liter/molÂ· min) in combination with 
increased kp results in very short periods during which the molecular weight increases 
with time. This prevents reliable estimation of kp by this method [127, 128]. 
It is interesting to note that if such unstable catalysts are used at low temperatures, when 
k;' -+ 0 and fGdR -+ 0, the correlation between v and Q(T) becomes linear (using Eqns. 1-43, 
1-40-a, 1-49, and 1-39)

i.e., the condition generally used for the "living chain" mechanism holds in spite of the 
presence of an important chain termination step, the reaction of the active center deactiv-
ation, characterized by kd â¢ One such example is presented in Ref. [111] for ethylene poly-
merization with the (j-TiCI3-AIEt3 system at OÂ°C in liquid paraffin-see Fig. 1-28. 
Even reactions proceeding with very high kp can be studied quantitatively with a 
method resembling the stop-flow technique [129]. According to this technique, 
solutions or suspensions of a catalyst and a co-catalyst are effectively mixed in the 
presence of monomer in a stream flowing with a high speed. After a very short 
polymerization time (0.7-2.5 s) the reaction is terminated by addition of alcohol 
and the polymer products are analyzed by GC or GPC methods. When the 
TiCI4-Al(Oct)3 system was studied by this method (ethylene polymerization at 
20Â°C) only low molecular weight polymer products were obtained. kp estimated 
from the length of the highest molecular weight component (measured by GC) was 
,..., 70 liter/molÂ· s. When the supported catalyst TiCI4/Mg(OEt)2/ Al (Octh was in-
vestigated by the same technique it was found that ca. 80 wt. % of the polymer 
product formed also had a low molecular weight (kp = 400 liter/mol' s at 40Â°C). 
However, 20 wt. % of the product had a high molecular weight indicating the 
presence of some amount of very highly active centers (kp at 40Â°C up to 6 X 105 
liter/molÂ·s). Obviously, this supported catalyst has a wide distribution of poly-

merization centers with respect to their activity (see Chapter IV for more informa-
tion) and even the possibility of the existence of chemically different active centers 
in the same catalyst should be considered. 
Data on the molecular weight change of poly-I-butene in the initial stage of its isospecific 
polymerization are less straightforward than similar data for other olefins. The data obtained 
at high temperatures [120, 121] show that M. of poly-I-butene obtained with the 8-
TiCI3-AIEt2CI system slightly decreases with time at 60Â°C under conditions where M. of 
polyethylene and polypropylene increases. Moreover, this M. decrease is accompanied by an 
increase in Mw/M. from ~ 5 after the first 15 min of polymerization up to ~ 12 after 2 hours. 8 
As a result, Mw of poly-I-butene increases with time which is in accordance with the data on 
the viscosity increase of poly-I-butene with the polymerization conversion at 30Â°C, presented 
in Ref. [65]. 
Experiments performed with different catalytic systems at low temperatures (OÂ°C) showed 
that both Mw [130,131] and M. [36] for poly-I-butene increase with time, much in the same 
way as for polyethylene and polypropylene at this and higher temperatures. However, this 
increase is restricted to a very short polymerization duration, 2-3 min, and, if kp is estimated 
by applying the general approach (Eqn. 1-46) (see Fig. 1-29) the kp values are much higher 
than those expected from general considerations of olefin reactivity (discussed in detail in 
8 According to Refs. [120, 121] the Mw/M" ratios for polyethylene and polypropylene obtained under 
similar conditions remain virtually constant throughout polymerization runs.

Section I-S-b) and from the data on olefin copolymerization (Section 1-4). For example, kp for 
I-butene polymerization at DoC estimated from these data is 23 liter/mol' s whereas the same 
parameter for propylene polymerization at 30Â°C does not exceed 3-Sliter/mol' s. It should be 
taken into account that the catalyst activity in these experiments at DoC is very low. The 
absolute amount of poly-I-butene collected for the initial 2-3 min is usually in the range of 
0.03 to 0.1 g per run [130]. The concentration of polymerization centers in these runs 
calculated with Eqn. I-IS-a for the data presented in Ref. [36] (R for the first 2 min is ca. 0.7 
x 10-2 mol I-butene/mol-TiCI3 . s, I-butene concentration in the system is 4.3 mol/liter, and 
kp estimated in Fig. 1-29 is 23 liter/mol' s) is ca. 7 x 10- 5 mol/mol TiCI3. This concentration 
is at least SO-ISO times lower than the average concentration of polymerization centers in the 
heterogeneous systems based on <5-TiCI3 (2 x 10-3-1 x 10-2 mol/mol TiCI3) estimated in 
numerous studies which are discussed in Chapter II (see Tables 11-8-11-10). 
The suggestion can be made that all these effects can be explained by a specific pheno-
menon: a wide distribution of polymerization centers in heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta 
catalysts with respect to their activity. This phenomenon is discussed on a quantitative level 
in Chapter IV. The following situation can be visualized. At low temperatures, during the 
first few minutes of the reaction only the most active centers have enough time to complete 
initiation steps and to start the growth of polymer chains with a high propagation rate 
constant. Subsequently new centers become activated (polymerization rate increases in time) 
but these centers are characterized by lower kp and, as a result, Mn ceases to increase and there 
is even a tendency for Mn to decrease with time [120, 121]. The same phenomenon was also 
found for ethylene and propylene polymerization (see Section IV-2) but apparently its 
manifestations are much more pronounced in the case of I-butene polymerization at low 
temperatures. 
1-3-c. Mean Lifetime of a Polymer Chain 
Some authors, following the procedure outlined in Ref. [48], present their experi-
mental data on molecular weight growth with time in terms of the parameter "mean 
lifetime of a polymer chain," [50, 80, 87]. By definition [48], L is the time necessary 
for a given polymerization center to form a polymer chain with the stationary 
molecular weight Mn(stat) (or the stationary degree of polymerization v.tat). The 
definition on' 
stat has been given in Section 1-2-a (see Eqn. 1-13). 
The intrinsic rate of growth of a polymer chain on a polymerization center is 
kpCmo Hence, the definition of Lis: 
(I-51) 
To find the correlation between L and measurable polymerization parameters, V, 
Q(T), R(T), the general relationship given by Eqn. 1-46 can be applied. Its differen-
tiation gives: 
d(1/v) 
(I-52) 
Substituting Eqn. I-52 into Eqn. I-51 one obtains:

v.tat in Eqns. I-51 and I-53 is equivalent to I/N 9 = I/Voo in Eqn. 1-46 and can be 
estimated as the intercept of a I/V-R(T)/Q(T) plot: see, for example, Figs. 1-22-B, 
1-23, 1-24, 1-25, 1-26, and 1-29. This last method for the estimation on'stat is very 
beneficial because in many olefin polymerization experiments, especially those 
performed at low temperatures, v.tat can be reached only in very prolonged runs [67, 
80,125]. 
If a catalyst used in a reaction is stable and the initial acceleration stage is short, 
the last expression can be simplified using the relation R/Q(T) = I/T[l5, 48,87]

(I-54) 
In Ref. [87] the experimental data on propylene polymerization with the f>-
TiC13-AlEt2 CI catalytic system were treated using Eqn. I-54 for the L calculations. 
The application of Eqn. I-54 for this purpose, instead of the more general Eqn. I-53, 
is apparently justified for this polymerization because the catalytic system employed 
exhibits sufficiently stable behavior (mandatory for Eqn. I-54): even at 70Â°C Rp 
decreases only by a factor of 1.5 during the run. The estimation of L gives one the 
possibility of determining kp using Eqn. 1-51. These data are presented in Table 1-8. 
Such treatment of the experimental data for the v-Q(T) dependence is equivalent to 
the method based on the application of Eqn. 1-46 but it is less precise for the 
estimation of kp because it involves the estimation of v.tat which corresponds to a 
very high stationary molecular weight: Mw(stat) ~ I x 106 â¢ Activation parameters of 
propylene polymerization calculated from kp in Table 1-8 are: Eact = 8.3 kcal/mol, 
InA = 6. 
The physical meaning of L is explicit in the case of stationary polymerization 
when Eqn. I-54 holds. The expression forv.tat in this case is that given by Eqn. 1-13. 
Substituting Eqn. 1-13 into Eqn. I-51 one obtains: 
9 N = C,erm/Q(T}.

(I-55) 
i.e., L for stationary polymerization is equal to the reciprocal of the sum of the chain 
transfer reaction rates. If transfer to monomer (Reaction 1-5) is the principal chain 
transfer reaction (with the ct-TiCI3-AlEt3 system, at high Cm) k'('Cm > krRC~R 
+ k:P and L ~ l/k'('Cm , i.e., it is reciprocal to Cm. On the other hand, if the principal 
chain termination process is the reaction with an organometallic compound (Reac-
tion 1-6) and krRC~R > k'('Cm + k:P, L ~ l/krRC~R' i.e., it is independent of Cm. 
Judging by the data presented in Ref. [87], the last case is characteristic for olefin 
polymerization with the <5-TiCI3-AlEt2CI system at high temperature. 
The L value is quite meaningful when compared with the polymerization dur-
ation T. If ct-TiCl3-based catalytic systems are used for propylene polymerization at 
high temperatures (i.e., 70Â°C) in combination with AlEt3, BeEt2, etc., the estima-
tion of L can be done from the following parameters: 
[l1]stat (measured in tetralin at l35Â°C) = 2-3 
-
5 
Mw(stat) (from Ref. [25]) = 2.2-3.6 x 10 
v,tat (assuming Mw/Mn = 5-10) = 500-1700 
kp ~ 5 liter/molÂ· s (see later, Section 1-5) 
If the polymerization is carried out at low monomer concentration (i.e., 0.5 
mol/liter, corresponding to propylene pressure of ca. 1.5 atm), L ~ 3-10 min which 
coincides with experimental estimations [48, 132, 133]. If propylene concentration is 
high (5-8 molJliter, in liquid propylene or propane-propylene mixtures) L ~ 1 min, 
i.e., under these conditions the overall dependence of molecular weight on time for 
stereospecific olefin polymerization is close to that for typical radical polymeriza-
tions of vinyl monomers. One should not confuse L, as defined in Eqn. I-51, with 
the semiquantitative estimations of polymerization duration after which polymer 
molecular weight becomes independent of time (1["l=constJ Mw and Mn for a polymer 
sample obtained in a particular experiment are cumulative values and 1["l=const. is 
usually several times higher than L. 
When polymerization temperature is decreased to 15-20Â°C kp decreases to ca. 0.3 
liter/molÂ· sand [l1]stat increases to 5 (for AlEt3 [52])-10 (for BeEt2 [90, 91]), v,tat 
increases to 1600-3900. Correspondingly, for Cm = 0.5 mol/liter, L increases to 
150-300 min, i.e., if Tis 2-3 h the polymerization process can be regarded as a 
"quasi-living" one: polymer chains grow during most of the polymerization time. 
This conclusion is in qualitative agreement with the experimental data [48]: at 15Â°C 
1["l=const. is 1-3 h. 
The problem of estimating L, in the case of catalysts based on <5-TiCI; and 
supported catalysts, remains the subject of significant controversy, which was 
emphasized in Ref. [125] where principal differences between findings of different 
authors were indicated. Some workers found that Mw is virtually constant through-
out polymerization runs [64, l32-l34] whereas others demonstrated a gradual Mw 
growth with time [67, 80], i.e., the existence ofliving chains. 

54 
I: Kinetics of Olefin Polymerization with Heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta Catalysts 
As can be seen from the previous discussion, the formulation of the "living 
chain" mechanism depends on the relation between two values, the polymerization 
duration T and the mean lifetime L. L is proportional to Vstat reached under 
particular conditions (Eqn. I-51). As was discussed in Section I-2-a, the 15-
TiCl 3-AlEt2Cl system exhibits substantially lower k';'/kp and substantially highly 
Vstat values compared to the ct-TiCI3-AlEt3 system but the polymerization activities 
of both systems are similar. The review of many papers dealing with the subject [49, 
56, 67, 70, 80, 125] indicates that Mw(stat) for polypropylene obtained with the 15-
TiC13-AlEt2Cl system at 60-70Â°C is of the order (1-2) x 106 , i.e., Mn(stat) ~ (1-2) 
X 105 and v"tat ~ (2.5-7) x 103; this value of Mw(stat) is 4-6 times higher than that 
for polypropylene obtained with the ct-TiC13-AlEt3 system under these conditions. 
Assuming that kp for this system is 2-5 liter/molÂ· s (see Sections I-3-a and 1-5) one 
obtains for low propylene concentration (0.5 mol/liter) L values in the range of 
20-90 min. At 50Â°C, v"tat increases and kp decreases to 1-2 liter/molÂ· s, increasing L 
to 100-500 min which is comparable to the usually used duration of polymeri-
zation, T. Polypropylene is produced commercially with the 15-TiC13-AlEt2 Cl 
system in the 70-80Â°C temperature range and at em = 5-8 mol/liter. Under these 
conditions the L values are of the order of a few minutes and the conditions of 
"living chain" polymerization are not met, i.e., each polymerization center pro-
duces several polymer macromolecules per run. At low temperatures (20-30Â°C) kp 
for propylene polymerization is low and the polymer chains can grow for up to a few 
hours [50, 66], i.e., these polymerization processes can be defined as "quasi-living" 
ones. 
Higher olefins have kp values lower than that for propylene and v"tat for their 
polymers are of the same order as for polypropylene, i.e., their L values are usually 
higher than those observed for propylene polymerization. On the other hand, many 
supported catalysts (TiCl4 on MgCI2, TiCl4 on Mg(OEt)2) are characterized by 
very high kp values compared to kp for conventional catalysts, whereas v"tat values for 
these polymers are close to those obtained with 15-TiCl3-based catalysts [36, 64, 119, 
127, 28]. For such catalysts, L does not exceed a few minutes at high monomer 
concentrations. This is confirmed by experimental observations: 1['11=const. for such 
catalysts is usually very small (1-2 min) [64, 119]. 
I-3-d. 
Olefin Block-Copolymers 
The discovery of substantial mean lifetimes for polyolefin chains associated with 
some of the heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts discussed in the previous section 
suggests the possibility of synthesizing olefin block-copolymers with these catalysts. 
The copolymers would have the following structure 
-(AAAAAAAAAAAAAA) (BBBBBBBBBBBBB)-
where A and B are different olefin units. Of course, this structure represents only the 
simplest possibility and more complex sequences can be easily visualized, viz. 

1-3: Molecular Weight Growth in the Beginning of a Polymerization Reaction 
55 
-(AAAAAAAAAA) (BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB) (AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA)-
-(AAAAAAAAAA) (AB)random(BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB)-
-(AAAAAAAAAAA) (BBBBBBBBBBBBBB) (CCCCCCCCCCCCCCC)-. 
The idea of the synthesis of these block-copolymers comes from the area of 
anionic polymerization where the virtual absence of any chain transfer or termi-
nation reactions gives one the possibility to obtain precisely tailored binary and 
ternary copolymers of styrene, butadiene, and isoprene. As was discussed in Section 
1-2, the situation is different in the case of typical heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta 
catalysts. All these catalytic systems exhibit different chain transfer reactions both 
at high and low temperatures. In addition, some of these systems are unstable with 
time (Section 1-2-c) which implies an additional chain termination reaction in the 
systems. All such reactions interfere with the formation of products having a 
uniform structure. 
The stringent requirements for the synthesis of olefin block-copolymers with a 
regular structure were formulated in Ref. [69]. They included the following 
conditions: 
(i) all polymerization centers must become active simultaneously, 
(ii) all of the centers must stay alive during the polymerization (i.e., no catalyst 
deactivation process should occur) and all polymer chains must remain at-
tached to the centers, 
(iii) all of the centers must have equal activity, 
(iv) all of the centers must be equally accessible to the available olefin molecules, 
(v) the crossover propagation rate (-AAAAO + Band -BBBBBo + A) must be 
high for these centers, 
(vi) the centers must be isospecific for olefin polymerization and produce linear 
polyethylene molecules. 
These requirements were formulated while keeping in mind the principal features of 
typical anionic initiators (sodium naphthalene, lithium alkyls, etc.) and most of 
them definitely do not hold for real heterogeneous catalysts, especially the first one 
(initiation reactions are significant in many cases; see Section 1-2-b), the second one 
(both chain transfer reactions and catalyst deactivation reactions exist), and the 
third one (the centers of heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts are characterized by 
a wide distribution of activities; see Chapter IV). 
There have been numerous experimental attempts to obtain olefin block-
copolymers and this subject has been reviewed [65, 69, 135]. The attempts were 
mainly devoted to the synthesis of propylene block-copolymers with the principal 
goal of improving mechanical characteristics of polypropylene at low temperatures. 
Most of the copolymerizations studied were those of propylene with ethylene (types 
PPPPPEEE and PPPPPP(EP)random>. However, propylene block-copolymers with 
I-butene [69, 135], 4-methyl-I-pentene [43], and vinylcycIohexane [136] have also 
been described. Some of these products are produced on a commerical scale. 
How justified are the claims in numerous patents on this subject (see lists of 

56 
I: Kinetics of Olefin Polymerization with Heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta Catalysts 
patents [65,69,135]) with respect to the real structure of the products? It is evident 
that any failure to comply with the requirements listed above will result in the 
formation of compositionally inhomogeneous products and ultimately in mixtures 
of homo polymers rather than the claimed block-copolymers. 
Data presented in the previous section can be used to elucidate conditions for the 
synthesis of olefin block-copolymers and to estimate the purity of the products. 
Some general preliminary suggestions can be made concerning the choice of 
catalysts and polymerization conditions suitable for the synthesis. It is evident from 
the estimation of L presented in Section I-3-c that a temperature decrease usually 
favors an increase in L, a prerequisite for block-copolymer formation (see Table 1-
8). The preferential property of a catalyst suitable for this purpose is stability in 
combination with reasonable activity, because decrease in catalyst activity with time 
reflects a decrease in active center concentration which will eventually result in a 
decrease in product uniformity. All catalytic systems discussed in this book can be 
roughly divided onto three groups as far as their application for block-copolymer 
synthesis is concerned: systems of the type Il(-TiCI3-AlEt3 (stable, medium activity); 
b-TiCl3-AlEt2CI systems (moderately stable, medium activity), and supported 
TiCl4-based catalysts used conventionally for propylene polymerization (usually 
highly unstable, very high activity). A detailed description of these catalysts can be 
found in Section II-I. 
The catalysts of the first type usually exhibit one kinetic feature that is disadvan-
tageous from the point of view of block-copolymer synthesis: the principal chain 
termination reaction for these catalysts is chain transfer to monomer (Reaction 1-5) 
which results in short L (see previous section). Moreover, in this case L cannot be 
manipulated by varying monomer concentration because both the propagation and 
the chain transfer steps are first-order reactions with respect to em. This disadvan-
tage is substantially reduced for the b-TiCl3-based catalysts for which chain transfer 
to monomer is less pronounced (Section I-2-a) and L is higher under comparable 
conditions than for the first type of catalysts. Typical supported catalysts are very 
unstable (activity at 40Â°C drops by a factor of two after the first 8-10 min) and have 
much higher kp than conventional catalysts [64,119,122,127], which reduces Land 
prevents the formation of uniform block-copolymers. 
The generally adopted procedure for the synthesis of the simplest block-copolymer of the 
type (AAAAAAAAAA)(BBBBBBB) includes three stages [65, 69]: 
(i) polymerization of the first monomer (usually propylene) for some time T1; 
(ii) complete removal of the monomer from the polymerization medium; 
(iii) an immediate admission of the second monomer (usually ethylene) and its subsequent 
polymerization for some time Tz at the same or changed conditions. 
Two questions should be answered to determine the purity of the product formed: what part 
of the polymer chains of the AAAAAA type are still in the growth stage at time T1 , and what 
part of the polymer chains of the BBBBB type will be connected to the AAAA blocks, the 
remaining BBBB chains being separate macromolecules formed after chain transfer reactions 
during the second polymerization stage? 
Let us consider a simplified variant of the general scheme of Eqn. 1-35 for high monomer

concentration, when initiation steps can be neglected and only the propagation, chain 
transfer, and catalyst deactivation steps are relevant. Time dependencies for Cp , R(T), and 
Q(T) for this case are given in Eqns. 1-39 and 1-40-a. After the first step of the block-
copolymer synthesis is over (time Td the fraction of living chains (c5uv) (compare with Eqn.

The number of these living chains at time Tl is Cp(Tl) (see Eqn. 1-39-a) and the weight fraction 
of monomer units in living chains (~liv) is: 
Cp(l1)Viiv

~liv = 
Q(Tl ) =

(1-60) 
and in the case of stable catalytic systems when Q(Tdl R(l1) = Tl 
(1-60-a) 
These expressions allow an approximate estimation of the living chain "survival" under 
particular polymerization conditions. For example, if the data presented in Table 1-8 for the 
D-TiCI3-AlEt2Cl system are used for the evaluation of Dliv and ~liv under conditions in-
dicated in this table, and if the first stage of block-copolymerization is carried out at 30Â°C for 
Tl = 60 min, Dliv and ~liv in the case of the stationary polymerization (Eqns. 1-57-a and 1-60-a) 
are 0.79 and 0.77, respectively, i.e., most of the polymer chains are still in the growth stage 
after I h of polymerization. If a catalytic system deactivates at this temperature and at Tl 
= 60 min, Q(Tl)IR(Tl ) = 116 min (which corresponds to the scheme with Co. 1 = 0, Co, 2 = 1, 
kd = 0.02 min- l ), Dliv and ~IiV decrease to 0.66 and 0.6, respectively (calculations with Eqns. 1-
57 and 1-60). If the block-copolymerization reaction is carried out at 50Â° for 1 h, Dliv and ~liv 
decrease to 0.45 and 0.29 (stationary polymerization) and to 0.30 and 0.09 (a decaying 
system). 
Approximate estimation of the fraction of block-copolymer molecules in the total product 
after the completion of both stages of this reaction can be based on the applicaton of the same 
approach as used for obtaining Eqns. 1-57-1-58: 
(1-61) 
where k~, c:;;., and L' are the propagation rate constant, monomer concentration in the 
polymerization medium, and the mean lifetime for the second monomer in the reaction. 
One of the most difficult problems in the synthesis of olefin block-copolymers is 
that of molecular weight control. It is evident that any attempt to decrease the 
molecular weight of the copolymers either during the first or the second stage of 
their synthesis will result in decrease of L and, as follows from Eqns. I-57, 1-60, and 
1-61, this will lead to a substantial decrease in the fraction of real block-copolymers 
in the final product. 
Experimental studies of the molecular structure of olefin block-copolymers meet 
one principal difficulty: in the case of the simplest di-block copolymer pf the type 
(M1)n-(Mz)m only one M1-Mz unit is present in each polymer macromolecule 
which consists of thousands of homo-monomer (i.e., M1-M 1 and Mz-Mz) links. It 
is questionable that this single link can be observed by spectroscopic methods (see 
later). Fractionation attempts also do not give unambiguous results: see Table 1-9 
[137]. It is known that the polypropylene fraction soluble in boiling ether has a very 
low stereoregularity (see Chapter III) and the lack of block-copolymer solubility in 
this solvent indeed suggests bonding between its polypropylene and polyethylene

segments, which are virtually insoluble in ether. However the absence of structural 
data for the block-copolymer fractions prevents their definite description. 
It has been firmly established in many publications that polymer products 
obtained under conditions suitable for block-copolymer synthesis exhibit many 
beneficial mechanical and thermo-mechanical characteristics, primarily high 
strength and decreased brittleness at low temperatures compared to mechanical 
mixtures of polypropylene and polyethylene [65, 69, 135-137]. These properties 
have been attributed to the existence of links between structurally incompatible 
polyethylene and polypropylene domains in these plastics which are absent in the 
case of homopolymer mixtures. Especially important is the fact that these specific 
properties were exhibited not only by block-copolymers as obtained by the poly-
merization reaction but also by these polymers after they were re-precipitated from 
different solvents at high temperatures [65]. However, no direct evidence for block-
copolymer formation and no reliable estimation of the block-polymerization frac-
tion in the total product was presented in these papers. Attempts to distinguish 
between ethylene-propylene block-copolymers and mixtures of polyethylene and 
polypropylene based on their thermal behavior (in particular, on the differences in 
their crystallization processes [138, 139]) were also shown to be nonconclusive [140]. 
Recently new attempts to obtain ethylene-propylene block-copolymers were 
undertaken via the gas-phase polymerization of ethylene and propylene with the 
standard b-TiCI3-AlEt2 Cl system at 40-50Â°C [140-142]. The application of a 
"dry" catalyst has two advantages: the complete removal of the first monomer after 
the end of the first reaction stage is readily attainable (by system evacuation) and 
some chain transfer reactions, especially those to organoaluminum compounds, are 
apparently suppressed. However, when used in a dry state the 6-TiCI3-AlEt2CI 
system exhibits two features which have a negative effect on the formation of olefin 
block-copolymers. The system is unstable (propylene polymerization rate decreases 
by a factor of two after 60 min and by a factor of three after 120 min), which results 
in a substantial yield of homopolymer during the first reaction stage, and the overall 
activity is low-polypropylene yields are in the range of 10.5-3.3 gig Ti for 120 min 
[141, 142]. 
A new technique for the differentiation between homopolymer mixtures and real 

60 
I: Kinetics of Olefin Polymerization with Heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta Catalysts 
block-copolymers has been applied [141, 142], based on the complex formation 
between polyethylene and urea in solutions at high temperatures [143]. This com-
plex has a melting point (142Â°C) higher than that of polyethylene or of urea which 
permits its easy identification. Polypropylene does not form complexes with urea. 
The procedure of urea complex formation (in xylene solutions of polymers at 
120Â°C) was applied to two block-copolymers, a ternary polymer (E)n-(P)m-(E)p 
with two flank polyethylene blocks and a central polypropylene block and to a 
ternary polymer (E)n-(R)m-(E)p with two polyethylene blocks and a central block 
of a random ethylene-propylene copolymer. 11 In the first case the block-copolymer 
was divided into two fractions, one forming the urea complex and the second 
remaining in solution. A 13C-NMR study of the first fraction (leached out from 
urea with methanol) indicated the presence of polypropylene while the 13C-NMR 
spectrum of the second fraction exhibited polyethylene signals, thus confirming the 
formation of real block-copolymer under these conditions. Application of the same 
procedure to the (E)n-(R)m-(E)p copolymer revealed that it consists of pure 
polyethylene (forming the complex with urea) and uncomplexed block-copolymer. 
This study demonstrated the high degree of inhomogeneity of the block-copolymers 
which can be expected if one takes into account the existence of several chain 
transfer reactions in the polymerization system and the kinetic instability of the 
catalyst. 
The final prooffor real block-copolymer formation was provided [141,142,144] 
by the 13C-NMR spectrum of a multi-block ethylene-propylene copolymer (see 
Fig. 1-30). This copolymer was obtained with the same <5-TiC13-AlEt2 CI system by 
alternating ethylene and propylene polymerizations for very short time intervals 
(for 10 and 30 s, respectively, with the vacuum removal of residual monomers 
between the additions) for a total time of365 min [141]. The peak assignment in this 
spectrum is: 
The presence of S",~+, S(J;;+' and Sy;;+ signals in the spectrum unambigously 
confirms the existence of chemical links between polyethylene and polypropylene 
sequences. It should be noted, however, that these results were obtained for the 
products formed under very specific conditions (gas-phase polymerization, low 
polymer yields). A similar study of other olefin block-copolymers synthesized using 
more conventional conditions in suspension polymerization is necessary'to demon-
strate the formation of real block-copolymers. 
11 Judging from the IR spectrum of the (P)n-(R)m-(P)p block-copolymer formed with the dry i'i-
TiCI3-AlEt2 Ci system [141] it provides very poor randomness for ethylene-propylene copolymers and 
long polyethylene sequences can be expected in the "copolymer" blocks of these products,

Consecutive Copolymerization 
The technique of block-copolymer synthesis gives one the opportunity to study 
some important kinetic parameters of olefin polymerization. One of the examples is 
the study of consecutive propylene and 4-methyl-l-pentene polymerization with the 
b-TiCl3 - AlEt2 Cl system [43]. The kinetic curves of the second stages of this reaction 
are presented in Fig. 1-31 for polymerization at 30, 45, and 60Â°C. In every case the 
second monomer was introduced into the polymerization system after the complete

removal of the first monomer. A comparison with the kinetic curves for the first 
stage of this process (Fig. 1-3) demonstrates that polymerization rates are nearly 
constant for both stages, but, in contrast to the first stage, no acceleration period 
was observed for the second stage, even at 30Â°C. This can be regarded as one of the 
kinetic manifestations of real block-copolymerization: the second monomer, when 
admitted into the system, interacts with completely formed polymerization centers 
which already bear "foreign" polymer chains and no initiation reaction takes place. 
Table 1-10 contains data on the effective rate constants for these block-
copolymerization reactions and corresponding homopolymerization process. It

ceed with the same rate constant, suggesting that the concentration of polymeriza-
tion centers on the catalyst surface is the same in both cases. On the other hand, the 
rate of propylene polymerization on "4-methyl-l-pentene" centers is always lower 
than for propylene homopolymerization. This can be explained if the assumption is 
made that in the first case propylene molecules interact only with the existing "4-
methyl-l-pentene" centers and, kp for propylene polymerization being the same, the 
difference in keff reflects the decreased number of these active centers [Cp (4MIP)] 
compared with the number of centers formed in the propylene homopolymerization 
reaction [Cp(P)]. 
If this assumption is correct Cp(P) : Cp(4MIP) is '" 1.3, i.e., propylene creates ca. 
30% more polymerization centers on the catalyst surface than 4-methyl-l-pentene 
does. It follows from these data that the kp ratio for propylene and 4-methyl-l-
pentene polymerization with this catalytic system is in the range of 2.0-3.0 and is 
virtually independent of temperature. 
A similar approach was used in Ref. [145] for the study of consecutive propylene 
and ethylene polymerization with the <5-TiCl3-AlEtz CI system. The following 
estimations were reported: 
Cp (ethylene) : Cp (propylene) = 2.0 
kp (ethylene) : kp (propylene) ~ 20 
I-4-b. 
Statistical Copolymerization 
The kinetic study of simultaneous polymerization of two monomers provides an 
additional tool for the estimation of propagation rate constants for different olefins. 
This method is especially convenient for many branched olefins because their 
homopolymers are very poorly soluble, even at high temperatures, which prevents 
reliable molecular weight estimation. 
The overall rate of copolymerizaton (or the rates of consumption of individual 
monomers in a copolymerization reaction) depends on the activities of the parti-
cipating monomers as well as on their relative concentrations in a polymerization 
medium. The simplest kinetic scheme of stationary copolymerization of two mono-
mers, Ml and Mz, is:

(1-62) 
where kll and k22 are the propagation rate constants for homopolymerization of 
Ml and M2 and k12 and k21 are the cross-propagation rate constants. 
The standard treatment of Scheme 1-62 [146] consists ofthe introduction of two 
reactivity ratios: 
(1-63) 
If the copolymerization of two monomers is carried out at constant monomer 
concentrations the reactivity ratios can be easily calculated from the relationship 
between the monomer concentration ratio. F = (CM,/CM)mon and the copolymer 
composition ratio /= (CM./CM,)cop, where (CM,)cop and (CM)cop are molar con-
centrations ofMl and M2 in the copolymer formed in the comonomer mixture with 
CM, and CM,: 
(1-64) 
Calculations of '1 and '2 can be performed either by graphical linearization 
methods [147] or by numerical and curve fitting methods [148-150]. All necessary 
details Of'l and'2 calculations can be found in Ref. [146]. 
The method of estimation of, 1 and, 2 is in effect non-kinetic: no real kinetic data 
are used and the calculations are based solely on measurements of copolymer 
compositions (usually by spectroscopic methods) corresponding to different com-
positions of monomer mixtures. The values of, 1 and '2 for different olefin pairs can 
be found in Refs. [69, 151, 152]. Some typical values are discussed later (see Table 
1-13). '1 and '2 for different olefin pairs have a great theoretical significance: they 
are good quantitative indicators of olefin reactivity and can be used for the com-
parison of olefin structure and reactivity (see Section 1-5-b). 
The measurement of copolymerization kinetics provides an additional oppor-
tunity to estimate propagation rate constants of olefin polymerization as well as k 12 
and k 21 â¢ The approach to the analysis of copolymerization kinetics is based on the 
assumption that Cp is independent of the composition of the monomer mixtures. 
This assumption does not represent a very crude approximation because kinetic 
copolymerization experiments are usually carried out in a relatively narrow range of 
F, whereas, as was discussed in the previous Section, Cp(M 1)/CP(M2) is of the order 
1.5-2 for typical heterogeneous catalysts. Cp consists of two parts, the amount of

centers with Ml the last unit (Cp(M 1)) and the amount of centers with M2 the last 
unit (Cp(M 2)): see Scheme 1-62. 
(1-65) 
There are many copolymerization experiments in which one of the comonomers 
is a liquid (styrene, vinylcyclohexane, 4-methyl-l-pentene at low temperatures, etc.) 
and the second comonomer is a gas (ethylene, propylene). Consumption of a 
gaseous monomer Ml in the copolymerization reactions can be measured in the 
same manner as is done for homopolymerization of M 1, i.e., the liquid comonomer 
M2 is regarded as part of the solvent. If CM, is kept constant throughout the 
copolymerization reaction (as is done in a homopolymerization reaction), the 
expression for the rate ofM 1 consumption [R(Ml)] can be written [43, 153] as 
(1-66) 
If the concentration of M2 in the liquid phase changes little in the process (for 
example, if the copolymerization reaction is carried out for a short time) the steady-
state copolymerization conditions can be applied [146] 
(1-67) 
i.e., 
(1-68) 
The combination of Eqns. 1-65 and 1-68 gives 
(1-69) 
Substituting Cp(M 1) and Cp(M 2) from Eqn. 1-69 in Eqn. 1-66 and taking into 
account that the rate of homo polymerization ofMl(Rhomo) is (compare with Eqn.

i.e., a linear correlation exists between the combination of experimentally measured 
polymerization rates ofthe same monomer M 1 in the homopolymerization reaction 
(Rhomo) and copolymerization reactions [R(Ml)] and F. The slope of this de-
pendence gives k12/k21 if rl is estimated independently from Eqn. I-54. Fig. 1-32 
presents kinetic curves of propylene consumption during its copolymerization with 
vinylcyclohexane with the b-TiC13-AlEt2Cl system at 70Â°C [153]. Polymerization 
rates decrease with time at this temperature and initial rates of propylene consump-
tion were calculated from this Fig. and were used for the calculation of k12/k21 
according to Eqn. 1-71. This correlation is presented in Fig. 1-33. Similar kinetic 
data for the propylene-4-methyl-l-pentene pair can be found in Refs. [43, 126]. 
Now, ifit is possible to estimate kll independently for Ml (for example, from the 
molecular weight change with time, as described in Section 1-3) for the same 
catalytic system and under the same polymerization conditions, then k 12 = k l1/r 1, 
k21 = k 12/(k 12/k21 ), and k22 = k 21 r2Â·

<5-TiCI3-AlEt2Cl system at 70Â°C gives [153] '1 = 80; '2 = 0.049; kll = 6.1 liter/ 
molÂ· s (an independent estimation), k12 = 0.08 liter/molÂ· s; k21 = 0.45 liter/molÂ· s 
(from the data in Fig. 1-33); k22 = 0.022 liter/molÂ· s. 
An analogous estimation for the propylene-4-methyl-l-pentene pair (the <5-
TiC13-AlEt2Cl system, 70Â°C) gives [43, 126] '1 = 6.4; '2 = 0.31; kll = 6.1 
liter/molÂ· s (the same value as in the previous case); k12 = 0.95 liter/molÂ· s; k21 
= 7.5 liter/molÂ· s, k22 = 2.35 liter/molÂ· s. 
These examples have the advantage that the consumption of a single gaseous monomer 
can be measured. If both monomers are gaseous (or both are liquid) such separate rate 
measurement is impossible and the estimation of propagation rate constants from copoly-
merization kinetics becomes more complicated. Nevertheless, a rough estimation of k1 dk22 
is feasible in such cases also. The general expression for the weight rate of binary copoly-
merization is 
(1-72) 
where M1 and M2 are molecular weights of the comonomers. 
Following the procedure outlined earlier in this section and using Eqns. 1-72 and 1-69 the 
following expression can be obtained for the ratio between R;;'op and the weight homopoly-
merization rate for one of the monomers, Ri:omo = k 11 Cp CM, M 1 (compare with Eqn. 1-70):

A similar approach based on the combination of data on copolymerization kinetics and 
the copolymer composition as a function of F was used for the study of ethylene-I-butene 
copolymerization in the 50-120Â°C range [155,156]. Kinetic parameters of this reaction at

Principal Kinetic Parameters for Olefin Homopolymerization 
and Copolymerization 
The propagation rate constants presented in Sections 1-3 and 1-4 can be regarded 
as "intrinsically" kinetic values, i.e., they were obtained in the study of "undis-
turbed" catalytic systems. The methods described for the measurement of elemen-

68 
I: Kinetics of Olefin Polymerization with Heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta Catalysts 
tary reaction constants are by no means the only available ones. Many complemen-
tary methods were designed to estimate these parameters based on intervention 
during the regular course of a polymerization reaction, "killing" the catalytic 
system with labeled alcohols or other reaction stoppers, or by the preliminary 
poisoning of a part of the active centers. All these methods, however effective and 
ingenious, are nevertheless not as straightforward as those described above and, 
what is more important, they are usually not as unequivocal. 
All heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts are extremely sensitive to virtually all 
chemical compounds (saturated hydrocarbons are the only real exception) and 
careful study usually reveals that the "forced" methods, like reaction inhibition or 
termination, frequently result in some unexpected modification of the system which 
gives rise to suspicions concerning the validity of these data. The literature on this 
subject contains many controversies in the interpretation of virtually identical and 
apparently "simple" experiments. 
It seems sensible for this reason to discuss all these supplementary data in 
connection with the general problem of catalytic poisoning-the principal problem 
of each catalytic study (see Section II-5). It is sufficient to say here that, generally 
speaking, the results obtained by the "poisoning" methods are in good qualitative 
agreement with the kinetic data presented in this chapter as shown, for example, in 
Tables II-8-II-1O. 
Kinetic methods discussed in Sections 1-3 and 1-4 give one the possibility to solve 
the principal "chemical" problem of olefin polymerization with heterogeneous 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts: to compare reactivities of different olefins in homopoly-
merization and copolymerization reactions and to correlate these reactivities with 
the structural features of olefins. 
1-5-a. 
Propagation Rate Constants of Olefin Polymerization: Comparison 
with Other Polymerization Reactions 
In the following discussion kp values for olefin polymerization should be treated as 
"quasi-elementary" rather them elementary constants. The first reason for this is 
that, according to existing views, the propagation step in this reaction consists of 
two consecutive steps, monomer coordination and insertion (see Section II-8 and 
Chapter V). Some attempts at semiquantitative evaluation of these two steps are 
presented in Section III-8. The second reason to regard kp as "quasi-elementary" 
is that, according to numerous data discussed in Chapter IV, these catalysts exhibit 
a very wide variation in the absolute values of these constants, i.e., the active centers 
situated in different places on the catalyst surface have widely different activities 
both in homo polymerization and copolymerization reactions. Hence, kj1 values are 
in effect averages of very wide distributions. Table 1-11 contains some representa-
tive kp values for different olefins and for different catalysts. When these data are 
compared and analyzed it should be remembered that the precision of these mea-
surements is at best Â± 100%. Nevertheless, these data can serve as a basis for the 
comparison of different olefins. 
Data presented in Table 1-11 make possible a rough estimation of activation

parameters for olefin polymerization if the comparison is made of kp values ob-
tained by the same authors. Eact values are in the range: 
13.0 kcaljmol-propylene polymerization in the 30-90Â°C range [80] 
8.3 kcaljmol-propylene polymerization in the 30-90Â°C range (based on the 
experimental data presented in Ref. [87]) 
12.6 kcaljmol-4-methyl-l-pentene polymerization in the 30-60Â°C range [43]. 
These Eact do not differ substantially from the effective Eact for olefin polymeri-
zation with heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts calculated from the temperature 
dependence of keff (10-13 kcaljmol, see reviews [15, 52, 68-70]) and are typical for 
many catalytic reactions involving double bond opening. 
It would be very instructive to compare kp for different olefins with similar data for other 
polymerization processes, radical and ionic. Unfortunately, a broad comparison of this kind 
is impossible. Most olefins, with the exception of ethylene (at high pressures or in complexes 
with transition metal ions [160]) and styrene, cannot be polymerized by radical and anionic 
mechanisms and their cationic polymerization includes isomerization processes which makes 
the comparison worthless. Some data on ethylene and styrene polymerization are collected in 
Table 1-12. 

72 
I: Kinetics of Olefin Polymerization with Heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta Catalysts 
The comparison of kp in Tables I -II and 1-12 shows that both ethylene and styrene are 
more reactive in radical polymerization than in usual Ziegler-Natta processes. The dif-
ference between styrene reactivity in Ziegler-Natta polymerization reactions and in free ionic 
processes is especially impressive. If the polymerization reaction with Ziegler-Natta catalysts 
is described as a "coordination anionic" reaction, the comparison with kp for styrene 
polymerization indicates that these catalysts should be regarded as very close ion-pairs 
indeed. 
A few data for propylene polymerization with supported catalysts containing 
TiCI4/MgCI2 as a solid component are presented in Table 1-11. They indicate that 
the average propagation rate constant for these catalysts is several orders of 
magnitude higher than that for the catalysts containing "solid" TiCI3 â¢ This finding 
was confirmed in a study of propylene polymerization with these catalysts using 
different poisoning methods (see Chapter II). Obviously, MgCI2 , which has a 
crystal structure similar to that ofTiCl3 , has a significant influence on the activity of 
polymerization centers. 
1-5-b. 
Monomer Reactivity in Isospecific Polymerization and Its 
Correlation with Olefin Structural Features 
It is generally accepted that the best way to compare monomer reactivities in a 
particular polymerization reaction is by comparing their reactivity ratios. A com-
prehensive list of '1' and '2 for values olefins is presented in Ref. [151]. Some 
characteristic '1 and '2 values are given in Table 1-13. The diagonal of this table 
contains some selected values of kp that are typical for polymerization of these 
olefins with TiCl3-based catalysts. 
Two qualitative conclusions can be made from Table 1-13: 
(i) A satisfactory correlation exists between kp for different olefins and their 
relative activities in copolymerization reactions as represented bY'l and '2' 
(ii) Reactivities of different olefins in the polymerization reaction with heteroge-
neous Ziegler-Natta catalysts vary over a wide range, e.g., the ratio of k/s for 
ethylene (the most active olefine) and vinylcyclohexane (one of the least active 
olefins) is ca. I x 104 â¢ 
Data on olefin copolymerization also make possible a thorough quantitative 
comparison of monomer reactivities. The propagation step in both olefin homo-
polymerization and copolymerization reactions (Reaction 1-4) is the reaction be-
tween a polymerization center (designated Cat-Polymer (v) in Reaction 1-4) and a 
monomer molecule. According to the established ideas on the mechanism of this 
polymerization reaction (which are discussed in detail in Chapter V) this polymeri-
zation step involves insertion of olefin into the metal-carbon bond between a metal 
atom (belonging to a polymerization center "Cat") and a polymer molecule. In 
general, (i.e., for a copolymerization reaction) this insertion step can be written as:

I: Kinetics of Olefin Polymerization with Heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta Catalysts 
where M; and Mj are different olefin molecules in the case of copolymerization and 
the same molecules in the case of homopolymerization. 
Reactions 1-74 imply that the reactivity of a polymerization center for a given 
catalytic system is not a constant value but depends on the structure of the last 
monomer unit in the growing polymer chain, the M; unit in this case. It is evident 
that the first step in the estimation of olefin reactivities should be a separate 
evaluation of two reactivities, those of an olefin and a polymerization center. 
We shall start with the discussion of the reactivities of polymerization centers 
which have different last units connected to them [192]. It was proposed in Ref. [193] 
to estimate these reactivities by the comparison of copolymerization and homopoly-
merization data. The definition ofrl and rz for the copolymerization ofMl and Mz 
is given in Eqns. 1-63. On the other hand, when the kinetics of two homopolymeriza-
tion reactions are compared, the ratio of the homopolymerization reaction rates is 
(from Eqn. I-IS-a) 
kll Cp(Ml)CM , 
k zz Cp(Mz) CM2 
where kll and kzz are the two homopolymerization rate constants. 
(1-75) 
A comparison was made [193] of the reactivity data for several substituted 
styrenes (M l) and unsubstituted styrene (Mz), under the assumption that Cp(Ml) 
= Cp(Mz) (the same catalytic systems were used both for the homopolymerization 
and copolymerization reactions). It was discovered (see Fig. 1-34) that an excellent 
correlation exists between R(Mz)CM,jR(Ml)CM2 and Ijrl for corresponding 
Ml-Mz pairs. This means that 
and, hence, k12 = kzz, i.e., the rate constant of Mz (styrene) interaction with an 
active center does not depend on the nature of the last monomer unit in a growing 
polymer chain-see Reaction 1-74. The mechanistic implications of this conclusion 
are evident: if the variation of the electronic parameters of the substituent R' in 
Cat-CH, 6-CH'-POlym", 
R' 
over a wide range (the Hammett parameter (J varies from -0.22 for R' = p-OMe to 
+ 0.39 for R' = m-Cl) has no apparent effect on styrene activity the polymerization 
step appears to be restricted mostly to the interaction of a monomer molecule and 
the "Cat" group and does not involve the last unit in the polymer chain.

75 
1/q 
Figure 1-34. Reactivities of substituted styrenes (standard: styrene) in homopolymerization 
reactions vs. l/rl values for styrene copolymerization with these monomers. Experimental 
data are from Ref. [193]. 
It is necessary to take into account, however, that the reaction center of the 
polymer molecule, the CH2 group attached to "Cat," is separated from the phenyl 
group by the substituted carbon atom CHPh. Usually the introduction of such a 
group between a reaction center and a conjugated system results in a substantial 
decrease of reaction sensitivity to the type of aryl group. For example, the damping 
effect of a single CH2 unit inserted between a reaction center and an aryl group is of 
the order of 0.4-0.5 [194,195], i.e., the p parameter for reactions ofR'-C6 H4 -
CH2-X is 2-2.5 times less than in the case of R'-C6 H 4-X. Thus, only a high 
reaction sensitivity to the electronic properties of R' can be discovered by this 
method. Another drawback of this approach is the assumption that Cp(Ml) 
= Cp(M2). Whereas no objection can be made to this assumption in the case of 
substituted styrenes, it evidently does not hold when monomers of widely different 
nature are compared (like styrene and ethylene)-see Section 1-4. 
An alternative approach to the evaluation of polymer chain influence on the 
polymerization activity is the direct comparison of different kij in olefin copoly-
merization reactions. The methods for k ij estimation were discussed in Section I -4-b. 
Some kij for different olefin pairs are collected in Table 1-14. 
Even if one takes into account significant uncertainty in the evaluation of these 
constants it can still be seen from the table that the rule kll = k21 (or k22 = k 12)

does not hold in the majority of cases and kij for a given monomer ''j'' depends on 
the nature of the last unit "i" in the growing polymer chain: 
for ethylene polymerization: U = ethylene) kjj/kij = 1.5-9 (i = propylene) and 
-7 (i = 3-methyl-l-butene) 
for propylene polymerization: U = propylene) kj)kij = 0.014-0.19 (i = ethyl-
ene) and -14 (i = vinylcyclohexane) 
Table 1-15 contains data on inductive Taft parameters (1* and three steric 
parameters for different branched alkyl groups CHRCH2 CH3 in 
attached to the end-CH2 group in a "polymer" chain consisting in this case of a 
single monomer molecule inserted into the Cat-CH2-CH3 bond. 
It can be seen from the table that the (1* values do not differ substantially for 
different models of polymer chains and the effect of variation in kij/kjj for polymer 
chains with different last monomer units can be attributed mostly to the steric 
influence of these last units which varies over a wide range. 
Chains with small R groups in a position P to the end-CH2 group increase the 
reactivity of a given monomer compared to its reactivity in a homopolymerization 
reaction. For example, if the last unit is ethylene (R=H) it increases reactivities of 
all other olefins while if the last unit is propylene (R=CH3 ) it increases reactivities 
of monomers with bulky alkyl groups like 4-methyl-l-pentene and vinylcyclo-
hexane (see Table 1-14). On the other hand, chains with bulky R groups P to the 
end-CH2 group inhibit reactivity of olefin molecules. 
This conclusion was confirmed when the first stages of ethylene-propylene 
copolymerization (initiation and two first chain growth reactions) with the b-
TiCI3-AlMe3-ZnMe2 system were examined [205]. The ratios between reactivities 
of ethylene and propylene, k1/k2' in reactions 
were found to depend strongly on the type ofR: For R = CH3 kdk2 is in the range 
of 3.5-4.9 whereas for R = n-Pr or i-Bu the ratio is ca. 20-25. 
Another argument in favor of this conclusion can be found if one compares, 1 
and, 2 for different olefin pairs. The definition of an ideal random copolymerization 
('1'2 = 1) implies:

or, in other words, kil/ki2 is independent of i, i.e., the relative reactivity ofM1 and 
M2 does not depend on the structure of the last unit i in a growing polymer chain (it 
can be produced either from Ml or M2). The examination of reactivity ratio tables 
for different olefin pairs (see, for example, Table 1-13 or Table 5 in Ref. [151]) 
reveals that there are many cases when r1'2 is much higher than 1, especially if the 
steric structure of M1 and M2 is stongly different. Some examples (from Table 
1-13) are: for the ethylene-4-methyl-I-pentene pair kE-E/kE-4M1P ~ 5(k4M1P-E/ 
k4M1P-4M1P); for the propylene-styrene pair kp_p/kp-st ~ 4-6(kst-p/kst-sJ; for the 
propylene-vinylcyclohexane pair kp_p/kp-VCH ~ 4(kvCH-P/kvCH-VCH). 
Thus, the ratio of reactivities for two monomers is not some constant value 
determined by the nature of the polymerization centers (in all previous cases they 
wen~ formed in systems containing TiCl3 and organoaluminum compounds) but 
depends on the structure of the last unit in the polymer chain. All kil/ki2 values in 
the examples are much higher than 1 (ethylene is much more reactive then 4-methyl-
1 "pentene, propylene is much more reactive than styrene and vinylcyclohexane) and 
it can be seen that the introduction of a bulky substituent in the last unit of a 
growing chain levels-off the difference between reactivities of these monomers. On 
the other hand, when both participating monomers have alkyl groups of similar 
sizes (pairs such as 4-methyl-I-pentene-vinylcyclohexane, 4-methyl-l-pentene-3-
methyl-I-butene, styrene-vinylcyclohexane, etc.) '1'2 products are close to 1 [lSI]. 
The same is true for copolymerization of substituted styrenes examined in Ref. 
[193]. 
To sum up the results of the discussion about the influence of the last unit in a 
growing polymer chain on olefin reactivity: no significant effect of the electronic 
properties of the last unit was found (however, only large effects can be noticeable in 
principle) but strong evidence exists for the steric influence of these last units in 
polymer chains on monomer reactivity. 
Now we will discuss monomer reactivity. It was found early in the study of olefin 
polymerization with Ziegler-Natta catalysts that great differences exist in the 
reactivities of olefin molecules. Examination of the data on their copolymerization 
provides a quantitative basis for this comparison. The theoretical basis for it was-
discussed in Ref. [198]. If one studies copolymerization of some standard monomer 
M1 with various monomers, M2, the value of l/r1 = k12/kll is a quantitative 
measure of the relative reactivity of M2 and M1 in the reaction with the same 
polymerization center carrying polymer molecules with the same last unit M1.12 
If one can neglect the role of the transition metal complex (designated as "Cat" in 
Reaction 1-74) in the propagation step, then these reactions represent an attack (tf 
the end-CH2 group in a growing chain (belonging to M; in Reaction 1-74) on the 13-
carbon atom of the olefin molecule CH2=CHR: 
(1-76) 
If steric properties of R in the olefin molecule are neglected, the kinetically 
controlling factor in Reaction 1-76 is the acceptor characteristics of the f3-carbon 
atom in the olefin molecule with respect to the end-CH2 group, and 1/'1 or r2 
12Ifthe standard monomer is designated as M2 the measure ofreactivity is r2 = k 22/k21 â¢

should be correlated with such electronic characteristics as Hammett () parameters 
for substituted styrene molecules or Taft ()* parameters for olefin molecules, 
However, if the role of "Cat" in the propagation reaction ofEqn. 1-74 cannot be 
neglected and the interaction between "Cat" and the approaching olefin molecule 
CH2=CHR is taken into account, the donor-acceptor interaction between the 
double bond and "Cat" should be examined and this is determined by olefin 
basicity. Thus, in a quasi-anionic reaction (which is generally applied for the 
description of olefin polymerization with Ziegler-Natta catalysts, see Chapter V) 
the monomer molecule plays the role of an electron acceptor in its interaction with 
the growing end of a polymer chain and the role of an electron donor in its 
interaction with the transition metal atom in "Cat." The study of the dependence 
between 1/r1 (or r2 ) and the characteristics of R in CH2=CHR enables one to 
evaluate the relative significance of these two interactions in the propagation step. 
This analysis is correct only if the steric characteristics of R are similar for 
different olefins. This condition is apparently met when styrene derivatives are 
studied [193]. The values of logr2 estimated for copolymerization of different 
substituted styrenes and unsubstituted styrene are correlated in Fig. 1-35 with () 
values. The resulting p value is - 0.95 whereas p for the anionic vinyl copolymeri-
zation reaction is + 5 [199]. This difference between p values implies that the limiting 
step of olefin insertion into the metal-carbon bond (Reaction 1-74) is not the olefin 
interaction with the end-CH2 group of a growing polymer chain (Reaction 1-76) 
but the interaction between the olefin molecule and the electropositive transition 
metal atom in "Cat" [193]. 
However, this conclusion cannot be correlated with the reactivity of other olefins 
in this copolymerization reaction. If the main characteristic of an olefin molecule 
responsible for its reactivity is nucleophilicity (the ease of electron release to "Cat") 
the olefin reactivity in copolymerization reactions can be correlated with their first

ionization potentials. Judging by these values (presented in Table 1-17) the order of 
olefin reactivity should be: 
styrene> I-decene > I-hexene ~ 3-methyl-I-butene ~ I-butene 
> propylene> ethylene, 
whereas the reactivity data given in Table 1-13 show that the real order is the reverse. 
Thus, some other factors in addition to olefin nuc1eophilicity play an important 
role in the propagation step. 
As was discussed above, the reactivity of different olefins should be compared in 
the copolymerization reaction with some standard olefin to avoid interference from 
the effect of the last unit in a growing chain on reactivity ratios. In the following 
discussion, propylene is chosen as this standard olefin Ml and klilkll = I/rl is the 
measure of olefin i reactivity in relation to propylene reactivity. 
Unfortunately experimental data for propylene copolymerization with some olefins are 
lacking. The following semiquantitative procedure for the estimation of kulkll was adopted 
for such olefin pairs. 
It was discussed earlier in this section that the principle of the ideal random copolymeriz-
ation ('1'2 = 1) usually does not hold in the case of olefin copolymerization and klllk12 
and k2dk22 can differ by a factor as high as 5-6. However, examination of the tables of 
reactivity ratios for different olefin pairs [151] shows that the average '1'2 value is -1.8. 
This means that, on an average, the effect of the last unit in the polymer chain on the reactivity 
of a polymerization center does not exceed Â± 100% and it is usually much lower than the 
difference between reactivities of different olefins. In such cases the approximation klllk12 
~ k21lk22 can be used for semiquantitative comparison of olefin reactivity or, more gener-
ally, klllk12 ~ kjt/kj2 Â· 
Thus when no direct experimental data on the reactivity ratios exist for propylene and 
some other olefin i but the ratios are known for the pairs propylene-x and i-x, where x is 
some third olefin, the following procedure can be used for the estimation of kulkll: 
~ 
_ kxi _ kxi . kxx _ '1 (pair x-I) 
kll - kxl - kxx kxl - '1 (pair x-i) 
(1-77) 
i.e., kulkll for an olefin i is equal approximately to the ratio of'l for two monomer pairs: 
x-propylene and x-i. 
Table 1-16 confirms the validity of Eqn. 1-77 for the estimation of kulkll and enables the 
precision of such estimations to be evaluated.

atoms. 
The experimental data on the relative olefin reactivity towards copolymerization 
with propylene (some of them real experimental data and some estimations with 
Eqn. 1-77) are presented in Table 1-17. These data correlate well with the 
previously published qualitative data on the order of reactivity for olefins [151]:

groups branched in [3- and y-positions > styrene> I-vinylnaphthalene

The reactivity order for linear olefins [151] is: 
propylene> I-butene> I-pentene > I-hexene ::::= I-heptene > I-decene 
> l-octadecene. 
Dependence oflinear a-olefin reactivity on the length of its alkyl group is shown 
in Fig. 1-36 where '2 values for copolymerization of ethylene and linear C6-C32 
olefins with the supported TiCI4/MgClz-AlEt3 system [200] are plotted versus the

from -0.1 to -0.2113 and hence the correlation between olefin reactivity and 
electronic properties of their alkyl groups is meaningless. 14 On the other hand, the 
role of steric factors Es in olefin reactivity can be evaluated dependably due to a large 
variation of these factors in the olefin series. The correlations between the logarithm 
of the olefin reactivity ku/kll and different Es are presented in Fig. 1-37. In spite of 
the significant scatter of the data the mai.n tendency is obvious; the increase of alkyl 
group bulkiness in the olefin molecule results in a significant decrease of its reacti-
vity. It seems reasonable to separate all points in Fig. 1-37 into two groups. The first 
group includes data for all olefins except for compounds with IX-branched alkyl 
groups. The b parameters in the steric component of the Taft equation: 
log (reactivity) = bsEs 
(1-78) 
for these olefins are: bs(Taft) = +0.9, b; = +0.65, (j~ = +0.72. i.e., substantial 
reaction sensitivity to olefin steric characteristics is evident. The data for olefins with 
IX-branched alkyl groups (3-methyl-I-butene, 3-methyl-I-pentene, vinylcyclo-
hexane) do not follow these correlations, indicating special sensitivity of the poly-
merization reaction to the substituent volume in close vicinity to a double bond. 
This feature of the reaction can be attributed to a severe space limitation in the 
transition state of the propagation step. This possibility is discussed in Chapter V. 
These conclusions find support in data on the relative activities of different 
olefins in the chain initiation reaction (Reaction 1-3) with the b-TiCI3-AIMe3-
ZnMe2 system [202]: 
(1-79) 
Relative values of k; estimated by the 13C_ NMR method are presented in Table 1-18 
together with a* and Es values of corresponding alkyl groups. 
These data are in good agreement with estimations of olefin reactivities in chain 
propagation reactions (Table 1-17), indicating the predominance of steric factors in 
both these reactions. The lack of activity of 3.3'-dimethyl-l-butene is especially 
significant, confirming special importance of space requirements in close vicinity to 
a double bond. 
Finally, the following mechanistic conclusions can be made from the 
"reactivity-structure" correlations for last units in polymer chains and olefin 
molecules: 
(i) Electronic characteristics of the last unit in a growing polymer chain appa-
rently do not influence the polymerization activity of active centers, which 
13 Some authors [20 I] argue that the inductive parameter u* reflects in effect steric properties of alkyl 
groups also. 
14The usage of the inductive factors for ethylene and styrene for this purpose is not justified because the 
H atom (the "alkyl" substituent in ethylene) has no constant u* value (it differs for different reaction 
series) and u* for the phenyl group is too strongly "contaminated" with resonance factors to be of any 
real help. If should be added also that Es for aromatic substituents are very imprecise.

implicates monomer coordination at the polymerization center as the rate-
controlling step of the propagation reaction. 
(ii) Steric inhibition of the polymerization reaction by bulky last units in growing 
polymer chains is apparent from the study of kil values for different olefins. 
(iii) The order of olefin reactivity: 
ethylene> propylene> I-butene, etc., 
is that apparently characteristic for typical anionic polymerization where the 
limiting stage is the attack of the anionic center on the olefin double bond [193, 
198]. However, the quantitative approach to the reactivity-olefin structure 
correlation presented above shows that, at least in the case of alkyl-substituted 
ethylenes, the origin of this order is not related to olefin electronic factors 15 but 
is primarily due to the steric characteristics of alkyl groups in olefin molecules 
which can influence both the interaction of olefin molecules with the poly-
merization centers (Cat) and with the last units of the growing polymer chains. 
Thus, the data on olefin reactivity in homopolymerization and copolymerization 
reactions with isospecific Ziegler-Natta catalysts demonstrate the substantial in-
fluence of steric factors on the reactions which masks any possible electronic 
influence and does not allow an unreserved conclusion to be made about the 
limiting stage of the reaction-the interaction with "Cat" or the addition to the 
growing end of a polymer chain. Experimental data for substituted styrenes advo-
cate the first interaction to be the limiting stage but the clear manifestation of the 
steric influence of the last unit in a growing polymer chain on polymerization 
activity of olefins contradicts this conclusion and reveals the significance of the 
second reaction stage. However, this contradiction is possibly only apparent: the 
rates of these two stages are probably comparable (see Section III-8) and olefin 
characteristics influence both of them.

the fact that styrene readily copolymerizes with olefins with these catalysts with the formation of 
statistical copolymers (see Table 1-13).

Chapter II 
Heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta Catalysts: 
Chemistry and Kinetics of the Formation 
and Functioning of Active Centers 
Introduction 
In the previous discussion no particular description of active centers has been given 
and the only quantitative parameter used for their characterization was Co, the 
total amount of active centers in the system. This amount was assumed constant in 
the case of stable heterogeneous catalysts (with the exception of the initial acceler-
ation period, see Section I-2-b) whereas in the case of unstable catalysts this value 
consisted of two parts: stable centers (Co,l) and unstable centers (Co, 2 = Co - Co,l)' 
This chapter contains information on the active centers: their location in the 
catalysts, their relative concentration, their chemical structure, the reactions leading 
to their formation, and their principal chemical characteristics, such as thermal 
stability, interaction with different chemical substances, etc. All these topics are 
usually involved in the study of any heterogeneous catalyst without regard to the 
type of product formed by the catalyst, i.e., whether it be a low molecular weight 
compound or a polymer. 
We start with the discussion of the last topic: does the fact that the product 
formed is a polymer bring about any principal difference in the behavior of these 
catalysts compared with other heterogeneous catalysts producing low molecular 
weight compounds? One of the differences is obvious: polymer molecules formed on 
the active centers usually do not migrate from the catalyst particles; they immedi-
ately produce crystallites and encapsulate the particles. However, these polymers 
are chemically inert, have a strong tendency to crystallize, and are not adsorbed 
(either chemically or physically) on the catalyst surface, i.e., the polymer crystallites 
are connected with the catalyst particles only by a few polymer chains that are in the 
process of growth. Thus the catalyst particle encapsulation by a polymer has no 
relation to the well-known phenomenon of catalyst deactivation resulting from the 
adsorption of reaction products on active centers. 
Still another possibility exists: the polymer may have a physical influence on the

polymerization process by imposing diffusion limitations on the reaction. Virtually 
all unsupported heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts are nonporous solids and 
hence only one diffusion process should be considered-the diffusion of monomer 
to the external surface of a catalyst particle. Careful quantitative estimations of two 
competitive processes, the chemical reaction of polymerization and the monomer 
migration from solution through polymer to a catalyst particle [1, 2], showed that 
"diffusion is not a consideration in propylene polymerization systems using an 
organometallic catalyst" [1]. Calculations demonstrated that even if the assumption 
that polymer produces a homogeneous film around a catalyst particle is valid, the 
diffusion limitation does not manifest itself for all heterogeneous catalysts with a 
specific surface area So more than 1 m 2jg whereas typical So values, even for 
unground catalyst samples, are usually of the order of 3-7 m2 jg. 
The Thiele modulus a can be used as a measure of the influence of diffusion control on a 
polymerization rate [2]: 
Here Dm is the monomer diffusivity, Ris the polymerization rate, C;,. is the monomer 
concentration in a polymer-solution system, and Ro is the initial radius of a catalytic particle 
(Ro :::::: 1 x 10-4 cm from microscopic observations). Calculations of a for different experi-
mental conditions showed that for ethylene and propylene polymerization with typical TiCI3-
based catalytic systems the order of magnitude of a is (1 -
10) x 10- 2, i.e., much less than the 
diffusion control limit (a ~ 1). The morphological study of nascent polymers [3, 4] demon-
strated that the crystallites of isotactic polyolefins produce complex open-work structures 
exhibiting substantial porosity [5], which further decreases the possibility of a diffusion 
influence on the catalyst activity.

a A shorter Ti-CI distance (2.22-2.21 A) was estimated recently by the analysis of the y-TiC13 extended 
X-ray absorption fine structure [8]. 
These conclusions can be supported by kinetic evidence. When stable catalytic systems of 
relatively low activity (for example, those based on cx-TiCl3) are used for olefin polymeri-
zation, the polymerization rates are virtually constant during many hours of the reaction (see 
Sections 1-1 and 1-2), confirming the practical absence of any polymer influence on the 
catalyst activity. On the other hand, when highly active unstable catalysts are studied (for 
which a decrease in catalyst activity by catalyst encapsulation is the most strongly suspected) 
the rate decrease was shown to be independent of the amount of polymer produced. When 
polymerization runs carried out at greatly different Cm and hence with greatly different yields 
were compared, kinetic plots of R/Cm versus time virtually coincided [6]. Additional proofs 
for the insignificance of diffusion phenomena were obtained in studies on ethylene and 
propylene polymerization using highly active supported catalysts [7, 280]. 
Thus it can be stated that no significant diffusion limitation is usually encoun-
tered in olefin polymerization reactions conducted under typical conditions, pro-
vided that effective mixing of the polymerization slurry is attained and the poly-
merization rate does not exceed the rate of gaseous monomer dissolution in the 
solvent. 
ll-l. Structure of Solid Components of Ziegler-Natta Catalysts 
II-I-a. Crystal Structure 
All chemical substances usually used as solid components of typical heterogeneous 
isospecific Ziegler-Natta catalysts, i.e., most different TiCl3 modifications (see 
later), VCI3 , CrCI3 , etc., belong to the same crystal class (FeCI3-or CdClz-type): the 
lattice consists of stacks of elementary sandwich-like sheets of atoms, each contain-
ing a layer of metal atoms arranged in regular hexagons of graphite-like structure 
surrounded by two layers of hexagonally packed halogen atoms. This elementary 
motif is presented in Fig. II-I where the top halogen layer is removed to reveal the

pattern of the metal atom layer. The Cl-Cl and M-M distances in the lattice are 
of the order of3.4-3.5 A; all M-Cl distances are equal [8] and are of the order of 
2.4-2.5 A (see Table II-I). 
The coordination number of all metal atoms is 6 and that of the halogen atoms 
(with respect to the metal atoms) is 2, i.e., each halogen atom makes a bridge 
between two neighboring metal atoms in the layer. The difference in Pauling 
electronegativities between such metals as Ti, V, or Cr (1.5- 1.6) and typical halo-
gens (2.8-3.0) is relatively small and the ionic character of metal-halogen bonds in 
the lattices is 30- 40% [13]. 
The lattice layers of TiCl3 shown in Fig. II-I can be stacked in two different 
regular ways. In the first case chlorine atoms exhibit closest hexagonal packing 
[9, 10]. This form ofTiCl 3 is called the a-form (see Fig. 11-2). The elementary layers 
in crystals of VCl 3 and CrCl3 are stacked in the same way. The second type of 
sandwich layer stacking in the case ofTiCl 3 corresponds to closest cubic packing of 
halogen atoms (Fig. 11-2). This form is named y-TiCI 3 . The distance between the 
transition metal layers in the crystals ofMCl3 is of the order of 5.6-5.8 A. The high 
resolution transmission electron microscopy technique gives the possibility of di-
rectly observing these stacked structures with spacing 6 A in the case of very small 
a-TiC13 crystallites [14]. 
Two additional crystalline forms were found for TiCI 3 . One of them (named b-
TiCI 3) contains the same sandwich layers as in the (1.- and y-forms (Fig. 1-1) and is 
characterized by a random disordered stacking of the layers: see Fig. 11-2 [12,15]. 
The last crystalline TiCl 3 form (fJ-form) has a different structure. It consists of 
linear polymeric TiCl3 structures (see Fig. 11-2): 
These are stacked together resulting in closest hexagonal packing of chlorine atoms 

98

[12]. Hexagonal cell parameters for this TiCl3 form are: a = b = 6.27 A, c = 5.82 A; 
Ti-Cl distances are 2.45 A; CI-CI distances within the chain are 3.4 A and 3.51 A, 
and Ti-Ti distances are 2.91 A [12]. 
Different methods for the synthesis of transition metal halides are thoroughly 
described in many handbooks on inorganic chemistry. Some examples of these 
syntheses follow: 
(1.-TiCl3 is obtained by TiCl4 reduction with H2 at temperatures higher than 
500-600Â°C or with different metals (Na, Si, Ti, etc.) at 400Â°C. The most 
frequent reducing agent is Al in a hydrocarbon medium at 250Â°C. The 
product of the TiClcAI reaction has the composition TiCI3Â· 0.33AICI3 â¢ 
AICI3, one of the products of this reaction, exists at low temperatures in a 
dimeric form (A12 C16 ) which perfectly co-crystallizes with (1.-TiCl3 and 
usually cannot be removed from it. 
j)-TiC13 is obtained by reducing TiCl4 with Al or organometallic compounds at 
low temperatures (usually in the O-lOOÂ°C range) or by reducing TiCl4 with 
H2 in an electrical discharge. 
'l'-TiCI3 is obtained by reducing TiCl4 following the same procedures as for (1.-
TiCl3 but at lower temperatures, in the 150-200Â°C range, or by heating j)-
TiCl3 above 150Â°C. In the case of TiCl4 reduction by AI, the reaction 
product also has the TiCl3 . 0.33AIC13 composition. 
8-TiC13 is obtained by prolonged dry grinding of (1.- or 'l'-TiCI3 or by their co-
grinding with AICl3 [12, 16]. 
VCl3 is obtained by reducing VCl4 with different metals and organometallic 
compounds or by its photoreduction. 
A scanning electron microscopy photograph of (1.-TiCI3 is presented in Fig. 11-3 
[5]. The (1.-TiCl3 crystals are usually well-shaped flat hexagons with large, nearly flat 
basal (001) faces consisting of chlorine atoms. Relatively narrow lateral faces of (1.-
TiCl3 contain, in addition to chlorine atoms, a significant amount of exposed Ti 
atoms which are coordinated to only five chlorine atoms instead of six, which is the 
case for each Ti atom inside the sandwiched layer (Fig. II-I). The existence of the 
exposed titanium atoms is the consequence of crystal electroneutrality which does 
not allow Ti atoms on the layer periphery to preserve their coordination number of 
6. The detailed description of these vacancy configurations and their incidence was 
published [17]. Typical parameters of unground (1.-TiCl3 crystals are: diameter, 
(main hexagon diagonal) 4-10 microns; thickness, 0.5-1 micron; specific surface 
area So, 1-2 m 2jg [16]. The semiquantitative comparison of So for unground TiCI3, 
made by the BET method and by crystal size measurements from electronic micro-
graphs, shows that these samples have very little if any porosity [1]. 
The morphology of 8-TiCl3 is quite different from that of (1.-TiCI3. The 8-form is 
obtained in the course of prolonged TiCl3 grinding (see next section) which results 
in a substantial decrease of the crystal size. The primary particles of 8-TiC13 usually 
have a globular form of diameter 0.03-0.7 micron [17, 18]. These primary particles 
are agglomerated in large (20-40 microns) secondary particles [18]. The apparent 
"external" So of these secondary particles is ony 0.1-0.3 m 2jg, whereas the real So of

the b-TiC13 primary particles is 10-20 m 2jg. The structure of the b-TiC13 secondary 
particles is relatively loose and they exhibit porosity of the order of 0.6 mljg [16] due 
to voids between the primary particles. When olefin polymerization of such particles 
begins, these voids are rapidly filled with polymer, after which secondary particles 
disintegrate into primary particles [16, 18, 19]. Depending on the amount and 
properties on the polymer formed in this inital period the separated primary 
particles either disperse in a slurry or remain loosely bound by the polymer in 
aggregates resembling the secondary particles in shape but with greatly increased 
size [18]. Figure II-4 gives a rough idea of the structure of the agglomerated b-TiC13 
particle. 
II-I-b. Catalyst Grinding 
Grinding of the solid components of heterogeneous Ziegler- Natta catalysts is one 
of the most important methods for increasing their activity. In this section the dis-
cussion of this subject is limited to studies on grinding processes and the mechanism 
of crystal dispersion, whereas data correlating grinding parameters and catalyst 
activity are presented in Section II-6, where they are related to data on active center 
concentration. Important data on the grinding of MCl3 salts (mainly TiCI3) are 
presented in Refs. [16], [20], and [21]. 
Forces responsible for the stacking of layered TiCl3 sheets (see Fig. II-I) in the 
three-dimensional structure are predominantly van der Waals forces, which are

weaker than the chemical bonds within these sheets. For this reason, according to 
the mechanism presented in Ref. [16], catalyst grinding causes extensive sliding 
between CI-Ti-Cllayers and this eventually results in a random packing of these 
layers with respect to each other, i.e., in the formation of the 6-TiC1 3 modification. 
This is especially pronounced when these solids are milled in a dry state [16]. In the 
case of very prolonged milling in a dry state a further crystallographic transforma-
tion to the fJ-modification is possible [16]. 
The second evident effect of grinding is a decrease of crystal size and a corre-
sponding increase of So . This process can be followed by two independent experi-
mental techniques: by So measurement using the BET method (N2 adsorption) and 
by the estimation of the mean crystal dimensions from the width of peaks in X-ray 
diffractograms. 
The BET adsorption method [22] is widely applied for So measurement in catalyst 
research [23, 24]. It gives one the possibility to estimate the total surface area open 
for the adsorption of small (N 2) molecules. The only apparent problem connected 
with its application for solid components of heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts 
[16] is that the removal of adsorbed gases prior to the measurements in a high 
vacuum (usually at 200-400Â°C) is accompanied by substantial crystallographic 
transformations (for example, the 6-modification is transformed into the ('J.-
modification) and by a crystal size increase. A decrease of the degassing temperature 
to 80- 100Â°C was recommended to circumvent this undesirable change. 
The method of crystal size measurement from the peak width in X-ray diffrac-
tograms is based on the simplified Laue-Scherrer equation [24-26]: 

II -1: Structure of Solid Components of Ziegler-Natta Catalysts

KA 
D = --:--::-:---=-
(13 - 130) cos {} 
(II-I) 
where D is the volume-weighted crystal thickness in a direction normal to the 
reflecting plane considered (angstroms), A is the wavelength of the X-ray 
(angstroms), {} is the Bragg angle for a corresponding plane peak, 13 is the peak width 
parameter-the integral or the width at half of the maximum intensity (radians), 
and K is the dimensionless shape factor [27]. K = I if 13 is the integral peak width and 
is close to 0.9 if 13 is the peak half-width. 130 is the correction factor for the instru-
mental broadening (for example, determined for large regular crystals) (radians). 
The crystal thickness, D, measured by this method is determined by all disrup-
tions in lattice regularity, not by the outer crystal boundaries only but also by all 
lattice defects, like layer slippage boundaries, strain surfaces, internal voids, etc. The 
X-ray method has its limitations: one cannot measure the size of big perfect crystals 
with D > 1000-1500 A (when 13 is close to 130) and the measurements of D < 50 A 
are unreliable, the most suitable range being 50-500 A [26]. One big advantage of 
the X-ray method is the possibility of the independent measurement of the sizes of 
different crystal planes. 
The expression for So of a powder with mean particle size D is [28]: 
(II-2) 
where do is the density; Â¢J is the form factor (for spheres of diameter D, Â¢J = 1; for 
cubes with length D, Â¢J = 1; for hexagonal pyramids with heights equal to the plane 
width, Â¢J = 0.84, etc.); s is the standard deviation of the D distribution. 
The transformation of Eqn. II-2 for the case of regular hexagonal crystals (like 
those shown in Fig. II-3) gives the following expressions for the correlations 
between the surface areas of the two principal crystal faces, basal and lateral, and 
crystal sizes perpendicular to planes <OOl), D(OOI>, and <hOO), D(hOO>. In the case of 
TiCl 3 crystals with do = 2.68 g/cm3 [9] and for typical S = 0.2-0.3 [28]:

where both D are measured using Eqn. II-I, in A. 
Few data exist for the comparison of So measured by the two methods [24]. It was 
found that for metal particles deposited on inorganic supports the estimations ofthe 
two methods are close [23, 27]. On the other hand, in the case of relatively soft 
molecular crystals of the layered type described above one can expect substantial 
discrepancies-So measured by the X-ray method is higher than the value measured 
by the adsorption method. This is due to the significant amount oflattice strain and

internal cleavage which produces surfaces inaccessible to gas molecules. Experi-
mental data on CaC03 grinding confirm this conclusion [29]. 
Table II-2 contains some data relating to this comparison and to the TiCl3 
grinding process. So values measured by the BET method were taken from Refs. [16] 
and [21] and So (X-ray) were calculated from D(OOI) and D(hOO) values presented in 
these papers. The data presented in Table II-2 can be rationalized in the following 
way. Initially unground samples (0(-TiCl3 and 0(-TiCl3 . 0.33AICI3) have small outer 
surface areas (small SoBET and small So visual [1]) but, as a result of the crystallization 
process, they have many internal cracks inaccessible to N2 but detectable by the X-
ray method. Thus they are characterized by high Sox-raY/SoBET ratios. These crystals 
can be visualized as tight stacks of thin regular platelets. These agglomerates are 
relatively stable and only prolonged milling in the presence of a solvent separates 
them into the initial platelets with virtually unchanged crystalline structures [16] and 
mean crystal sizes ca. 1000 A [14]. The Sox-raY/SoBET ratio for such samples is in the 1-3 
range, which can be regarded as a reasonably good correlation, taking into account 
differences in the surface area averaging (volume averaging in the case of the Sox-ray 
measurement and surface area averaging in the case of the SoBET measurement) and 
the existence of crystal defects in TiCI3 â¢ 
In contrast to "wet" milling, dry milling is a complex process consisting of the 
following overlapping stages: 
(i) The crystallographic transformation of TiCl3 occurs. Both 0(- and y-forms are 
transformed into the b-form and, after prolonged dry milling, to the p-form 
[12, 16]_ 
(ii) Numerous defects arise in the crystals. This results in a rapid decrease of both 
D(hOO) and D(OOI) as measured by the X-ray method (see Fig. II-5). The areas of

basal and lateral faces measured by the X-ray method become virtually equal: 
see Fig. II-6 [16, 21]. 
(iii) Significant crystal cleavage occurs along these defects with the formation of 
new surfaces as measured by the BET method: see Fig. II-7 [16, 20]. 
(iv) After dry milling of 0(-TiCl3 for a prolonged time (more than 100 h) a new effect 
emerges. Newly formed small crystals (the !5-form ofTiCl3) have a substantial 
tendency toward agglomeration [14, 16, 30]. These agglomerates are usually 
rather loose and have the form of shapeless porous globules [17, 18] but some of 
the newly formed small particles stick to each other very tightly with a partial 
loss of So, as measured by the BET method (see Fig. II-7). Even simple 
agitation of such dry-milled TiCl3 samples in an inert liquid medium results in a 
partial SoBET recovery [20]. The tight agglomeration is especially pronounced in 
the case of the dry milling ofy-TiCl3 crystals [16]. The s/-raY/SoBET ratios for the 
dry-milled TiCl3 samples are in the 4-8 range which is higher than for the wet-
milled TiCl3 samples and suggests the existence of numerous inner defects in 
the crystals inaccessible to N 2 during adsorption measurements. 
The structure of the defects formed in the course ofthe TiC13 grinding (as well as 
of the defects present in the original crystals) was studied by the ESR method at

both liquid nitrogen and room temperatures [20, 30-34]. The similiarity between the 
ESR signals of ground TiCl3 samples and the signals typical for the reaction 
products of the TiCl3-alkyl aluminum interaction (see Section 11-3) suggested the 
attribution of these signals to surface TiCl3 defects appearing after chlorine atom 
elimination [20, 31]. The study at low temperatures [32-34] revealed more detailed 
information. Several different defect types were discovered. They were subdivided 
into two types, the first existing in (J(-TiCl3 . 0.33AIC13 and {3-TiCl3 (with gil = 1.894, 
g1- = 1.942, g = 1.925) and the second in y-TiCI3 Â· 0.33AIC13 (gl = 1.733, g2 
= 1.807, g3 = 1.927, g = 1.823). Both these ESR signals are assigned to Ti3+ ions 
which have no Ti neighbors, for example, those surrounded by AICI3 â¢ The defect 
level never exceeds 10% of all Ti atoms in the TiCl3 samples. 
The correlation between the grinding duration and the characteristics of the 
resulting catalysts strongly depends on the milling conditions. Typical results for 
milling by stainless steel balls in a nitrogen atmosphere are presented in Fig. 11-7. 
The acceleration of the milling procedure can be achieved by the application of 
vibratory mills at low temperatures [16] or by milling in the presence ofinert liquids 
and special powder stabilizing agents [14]. 
II-I-c. Structure of Supported Ziegler-Natta Catalysts 
The development of a new generation of heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts 
started in the mid-sixties. It followed the typical route of the modification of any 
heterogeneous catalyst: the synthesis of supported highly dispersed catalysts with 
enhanced activity. The first important breakthrough was reported in two patents 
[35, 36] and was followed by several more patents [37-40]. Lists of the principal 
results in this field can be found in several reviews [41-44]. These supported 
catalysts can be roughly divided into two clas~es: catalyst; designed for ethylene 
polymerization and catalysts designed for isospecific olefin polymerization. 
Supported Catalysts for Ethylene Polymerization. 
Numerous inorganic and 
organic supports were examined, both chemically inert supports (polyethylene, 
polypropylene, graphite, carbon black, polystyrene) and supports possessing reac-
tive chemical groups either on their surface (silica, alumina, MgO, Ti02 , CaCI2 , 
NaCl) or inherent to the support structure (Mg(OH)CI, polymers with reactive OH, 
NH2 , COOH groups, etc.) [41-46]. The principal active components of these 
supported catalysts were TiCI4, Ti(OR)4' VCI4, VO(ORh, and VOCI3 â¢ The 
catalyst preparation procedure usually consisted of two stages: deposition of the 
transition metal compound on the support and its reduction by an organometallic 
compound. The study of these reactions by chemical methods, IR spectroscopy, and 
ESR spectroscopy revealed their principal features [32, 45-51]. If the support has no 
chemically active groups (like polyethylene or polypropylene powders) the final 
products of these two reactions are crystalline TiCl3 or VCl3 of very high dispersity. 
If the support contains reactive chemical groups (for example, OH) the deposition 
reaction of TiCl4 can be described as: 

106

(Support )-0-H 
(Support )-0""",-
+ TiCl4 -+ 
/' TiCl2 + 2HCI 
(Support)-O-H 
(Support)-O 
(II-4) 
In the case of MgO with surface OH groups the deposition reaction results in the 
disappearance of the 3770 cm -1 IR band typical for OH interacting with surface 
cations [48], HCI formed in this reaction readily interacts with MgO and MgOH 
resulting in the formation ofMg(OH)CI, MgCl2 [48,49], and water which produces 
new (Support)-OH groups [49]. The relative proportions of singly- and doubly-
anchored Ti species after the completion of Reaction 11-4 depend both on the 
surface concentration of OH groups and on the acidity of the support (i.e., on its 
ability to interact with HCI formed in Reaction 11-4) [32, 48, 50, 51]. 
The reaction of the supported transition metal species with organometallic 
compounds (usually AIR3 or AIR2 CI) results in two effects. The first one is 
alkylation of these species with the formation of transition metal-carbon bonds 
(studied by IR spectroscopy) [47, 48, 50, 51]: 
./"'" (Support)-0-TiCI2R + AIR2CI 
(Support)-O-TiCl3 + AIR3 
-"""(Support)-0-AIR2 + TiCl3R 
The second reaction is the reduction of various alkylated products of Ti4+ to Ti3+ 
species (observed in ESR spectra) and even to Ti2+ species. 
The overall effect of these two reactions is the breaking of nearly all (Support) 
-0-Ti anchor bonds and the formation of highly dispersed TiCl3 crystals 1 [32, 
47,50]. The X-ray study of these species showed that the structure of the TiCl3 crys-
tals depends on the Ti concentration and the reaction temperature. High activity of 
these supported catalysts is attributed to high So values ofTiCl3 and to the existence 
of numerous crystal defects. The small amount of isolated Ti3+ ions found in some 
supported catalysts has no apparent effect on their catalytic activity [32]. 
A comparison of the polymerization activity of conventional TiCI4, TiCl3-based 
catalysts, and these supported catalysts for ethylene polymerization showed [41-44, 
46, 52] that the latter exhibit 20-100 times greater activity i.e., polyethylene yield per 
unit amount of transition metal under similar reaction conditions. This was at-
tributed both to the increased number of active centers (see Section II-6) and to the 
direct influence of the support on their reactivity. The same is true for many Ti- and 
V-based catalysts supported on polymers with functional groups [45]. Apparently 
the simplest supported catalysts for olefin polymerization were obtained by the 
direct deposition of TiC14 (from heptane solution at lOODC), or by either TiC13 or 
Ti2(S04h deposition (from aqeuous solutions at 20DC) on such generally used 
supports as Si02, y-A1203' or Y-zeolite with subsequent heating of the resulting

the presence of Si0 2 [32].

solids under vacuum at 100-500Â°C for 3-6 h [53]. These solids by themselves can 
polymerize olefins at 65-75Â°C. Their activity was attributed to the formation of 
Ti3+ species on the catalyst surface which was proved by the ESR method. 
Isospecific Supported Catalysts for Olefin Polymerization. 
Supported Ziegler-
Natta catalysts of the type described in the previous section usually perform poorly 
when used for propylene and other a-olefin polymerizations: they produce up to 
30-40% of an amorphous material of little commercial value. Attempts to modify 
the catalysts by the selective poisoning of aspecific centers were mostly unsuccessful: 
an increase in crystalline polymer content was usually obtained but it was accom-
panied by a drastic activity decrease [43]. 
A significant breakthrough in this field was obtained by achievements discussed 
in several patents [54-56]. The general scheme of the catalyst synthesis consists of 
two steps [55, 56]:

Active solid component. [Ti] = 1.3-2.2 weight %, So = 150-200 m 2jg. 
The first step is the preparation of an activated support with a lattice structure 
similar to that of TiC13 . The most suitable solids for the support are anhydrous 
MgC12 or MgBr2 with H20 contents less than 1 wt. %. Several alternative processes 
for their activation were developed: (a) thorough prolonged grinding in a pure state, 
in the presence of electron donors (esters of aromatic acids, ethers, diamines) at 
[MgX2] : [donor] ratios from 2 to 15 or in the presence of TiC14 ; (b) chemical 
activation of MgX2 by electron-donor compounds or organic compounds with 
2 In some cases steps I and I' can be used consecutively for the support preparation [57]. 
3 In Ref. [58] two consecutive treatments with TiCl4 were proposed. They were separated by washing of 
the solid catalyst with a halogenated hydrocarbon, i.e., with CCI4 â¢ 
3'The two steps can be combined if MgCl 2 is ball-milled in the presence of TiCl4 [281, 282]. 

108

active hydrogen (i.e., alcohols); or (c) the synthesis of highly dispersed MgXz via 
reactions of Grignard reagents with halogen-containing compounds. Activated 
supports formed in these processes are typically fine powders with high So and 
deformed crystal lattices that contain numerous defects which manifest themselves 
in a strong asymmetric widening of X-ray diffractogram lines similar to that 
described above for the ground TiCl3 samples [55, 56, 59-61, 281, 282]. The 
formation of a new crystalline phase on the MgClz surface after its interaction with 
electron donors was also reported [61]. 
The second step of the catalyst preparation consists of supporting a tetravalent 
titanium derivative (preferentially TiCI4 ) on this activated solid. This reaction is 
usually carried out in liquid TiCl4 at 80-135Â°C for several hours. The catalysts are 
subsequently filtered, thoroughly washed with a hydrocarbon (hexane, heptane), 
and dried. These catalysts are fine powders of dark gray or yellow color with So in 
the range of 150-200mz/g. They contain 1.3-2.2 weight % ofTi and 62-69% ofCl. 
Titanium compounds in these catalysts are strongly bound to the surface and 
cannot be extracted either by liquid hydrocarbons or liquid TiCI4 . Most of the 
titanium remains in a tetravalent state (from 44 to 62% [57]). However, both 
titration data and the presence of signals in their ESR spectra show that some of 
these adsorbed species contain Ti3+ (from 28 to 47% [57]). If one assumes that one 
titanium-containing molecule occupies 30-40 A z on the catalyst surface then the Ti 
content in a monolayer on a support with So ~ 150-200 m?/g corresponds to 3-5 
weight % ofTi, i.e., a substantial fraction of the support is covered by Ti-containing 
products. The surface structure of these solids resembles that of 15-TiCl3 [62]. 
These supported catalysts when combined with pure AlEt3 exhibit very high 
activity in propylene polymerization, more than twenty times higher than conven-
tional 15-TiCI3. However, the polymers contain up to 50% of an amorphous atactic 
fraction [63]. On the other hand, if a mixture of AlEt3 and an organic compound-
an electron donor-is used at [AlEt3] : [Donor] ratios of 2.5-7, usually 3, the 
amorphous fraction content decreases to 2-7% while the catalyst activity remains 
high both in the absence and presence of Hz [55, 56]. Isospecificity of these catalysts 
does not depend on polymerization duration [283]. 
AlEt3 rapidly interacts with all organic compounds which are used as electron 
donors, especially at the increased temperatures that are typical for polymerization 
experiments, with the formation first of 1 : 1 AlEt3-donor complexes and later of 
ethylaluminum alkoxides (in the case of esters, ketones, aldehydes), alkylaluminum 
amides (in the case of amines), or salts (in the case of organic acids). These 
compounds in combination with unreacted organoaluminum compounds form 
very effective co-catalysts for isospecific olefin polymerization. The behavior of 
these mixed co-catalysts is discussed in detail in Section II-5 in connection with 
poisoning and modification of heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts. 
In Ref. [54] another method is described for the preparation of a highly active 
catalyst suitable for alpha-olefin polymerization. The preparation consists of three 
principal stages: 
(i) Reduction of TiCl4 by an organoaluminium halide (preferably AlEtzCl) under 
mild conditions (in hydrocarbon solution at 0-20Â°C for several hours) with the 

11-2: Formation of Active Centers of Heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta Catalysts 
109 
formation of P-TiCI3 crystals containing ca. 0.3 mol of an aluminum com-
pound (mostly AICI3) with very low So, ca. 1 m2/g. 
(ii) Treatment of this P-TiCl3 with a complexing agent, an organic compound with 
electron-donor characteristics, i.e., an ether, thioether, thiol, amine, amide, 
ketone, or ester. This treatment is carried out in an inert medium at 0-80Â°C and 
at a [Donor]/[Ti] molar ratio of 0.5-2.5. It results in the partial inclusion of the 
complexing agent in the solid, which retains its low So. 
(iii) Treatment of the product of the previous stage with TiCl4 either in a pure state 
or in a concentrated (30-40%) hydrocarbon solution at 60-80Â°C for 1-3 h 
with the subsequent removal of soluble reaction products. 
This last treatment is accompanied by structural and morphological changes of 
P-TiCI3 â¢ The prolonged heating results in the transformation of P-TiCI3 into ~Â­
TiCl3 and in the development of high So (75-200 m2/g) even ifno catalyst grinding 
was applied. The solid particles formed are characterized by a specific morphology 
featuring the existence of very small crystallites with the basal and lateral faces 
having dimensions from 50 to 100 A. They are agglomerated into particles with a 
diameter of 0.1-0.3 micron. The solids also exhibit other features typical of highly 
dispersed b-TiCI3 : broad peaks in their X-ray diffractograms and substantial par-
ticle porosity, higher than 0.2 ml/g. These small particles are further agglomerated 
into large (15-50 microns) relatively uniform particles with apparent densities ca. 
0.8 g/ml. 
The solids obtained in this procedure make, in combination with AlEt2CI, 
excellent catalysts for olefin polymerization exhibiting both high activity ('" 8.4 
X 104 g/gTiCI, at 70Â°C) and high stereospecificity: the amount of amorphous 
polymer formed is 2-5% in the case of propylene polymerization carried out under 
typical conditions. A comparison of this catalyst synthesis procedure with that for 
the supported catalysts containing MgCl2 shows many similar stages (the treatment 
with electron-donor organic compounds, the treatment with TiCl4 at increased 
temperatures) and it suggests that the catalyst synthesis described in Ref. [54] 
represents in effect the formation of a supported catalyst containing TiCl4 in which 
the support is ~-TiCl3 instead of MgCI2. It is quite conceivable that in this catalyst 
both the products ofTiCl4 transformation (in its reaction with electron donors) and 
the initial TiCl3 contribute to the catalytic activity. Two principal differences 
between catalysts as prepared in procedures described in Refs. [54-56] are: the 
elimination of the stage of the support grinding in Ref. [54] (but it is absent also in 
Step l' in Ref. [55]) and the application of AlEt2 CI as a co-catalyst in Ref. [54] 
instead of the AlEt3-electron donor combination employed in Refs. [55] and [56]. 
11-2. 
Formation of Active Centers of Heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta 
Catalysts 
Isospecific active centers of heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts are formed in 
the course of the interaction between solid catalyst components MClx (TiCI3 , VCI3 , 
CrCI3 , TiCI4/Si02, TiCI4/MgCI2, etc.) and organometallic compounds, usually 

110 
II: Chemistry and Functioning of Heterogeneous Catalysts 
organoaluminum compounds. The only important exception is TiCl2 which pro-
duces isospecific active centers without any additives, by interaction with olefin 
monomers. The apparent simplicity of the reaction generating active centers (only 
two components of a well-known structure are involved, the reaction is easily 
reproduced over a wide temperature and concentration range, the active centers in 
some cases are very stable, etc.) has been deceptive. In spite of numerous efforts 
during the last twenty-five years many details of this reaction and the chemical 
composition of the active centers remain unknown. Moreover, substantial attempts 
to study these active centers by various spectroscopic methods, like IR spec-
troscopy, ESR, etc. (see Section 11-3), which have proved so important and helpful 
in other fields of heterogeneous catalysis, gave very modest results. 
When unground samples of a-TiC13 (like that shown in Fig. 11-3) or VCl3 are 
treated with a solution of an organometallic compound (for example, AIEt3 or 
AlEt2 CI) in a hydrocarbon medium no apparent change in the crystalline compo-
nent was observed under a microscope: the crystals do not split and the only change 
noted was that their sharp edges become somewhat rounded [64]. On the other 
hand, when initially ground TiCl3 samples are treated with the same solutions their 
porous secondary particles usually disintegrate into very small primary particles 
[65]. However, both types of these products, either those remaining intact or those 
that have disintegrated, produce the same isotactic polymers and it can be assumed 
that the process of catalyst particle disintegration is not a vital part of isospecific 
center formation. One can suppose that this dispersion of secondary particles of 
ground <>-TiCl3 effects an increase in the number of active centers but does not 
influence their structure. 
Early chemical studies of the MCl3-organometallic compound interaction 
showed that this interaction is not vigorous. For example, significant Ti3+ -+ Ti2+ 
reduction in the a-TiCI3-AlEt3 system takes place only at high temperatures 
(> 100Â°C) and AlEt2CI does not reduce a-TiC13 in the 50-100Â°C range at all [66]. 
These findings, combined with the general observation of easy olefin polymeriz-
ation with these catalytic systems over a wide temperature range, supported the 
earlier view that the real active centers of isospecific olefin polymerization are 
organometallic compounds adsorbed on the TiCl3 surface. However, more detailed 
chemical studies revealed some definite although limited chemical reactions be-
tween MCl3 and organometallic compounds. 
As the first step in the examination of this interaction it is pertinent to study the 
interaction between an organometallic compound and ScCI3, a nonreducible crys-
talline analogue of TiCl3 or VCl3 which has the same crystalline structure as a-
TiCI3. The interaction between solid ScCl3 and ZnEt2 in isooctane medium at 20Â°C 
was studied by radiotracer (65Zn, 14C) methods [67]. Chemical analysis of the solid 
product formed after the 2-h interaction showed that it contains both carbon 
atoms (",,2 x 10-3 equivalent of ethyl groups per mole of ScCI3) and Zn. The 
[Et] : [Zn] ratio in this product was in the 2.7-5.6 range. This means that not only 
ZnEt2 adsorption on the ScCl3 surface takes place but that chemical interaction 
between ScCl3 and ZnEt2 occurs, i.e., an alkylation reaction: 
(11-5) 

11-2: Formation of Active Centers of Heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta Catalysts 
111 
All experimental data on the interaction between catalytically active MCl3 and 
organometallic compounds can be divided into two groups: (a) studies of the 
interaction in "dry" systems, i.e., in the absence of any solvent (the organometallic 
compound being admitted to the MCl3 crystals as a gas phase); and (b) studies of 
this interaction in an inert solvent suspension. 
ll-2-a. Interaction between Catalysts and Co-catalysts in the Gas Phase 
A careful and exhaustive examination of the "dry" interaction between catalysts 
and co-catalysts (mainly between tX-TiCl3 and AIMe3) has been conducted [68-70]. 
The first stage of the interaction between finely ground tX-TiC13 (So = 139-158 
m2jg) and AIMe3 vapor is a fast exchange reaction between the TiCl3 surface 
(mainly basal faces consisting entirely of chlorine atoms, see Fig. II-I) and AIMe3. 
This results in the appearance of chloro-organoaluminum compound in the gas 
phase: 
(11-6) 
This reaction is analogous to that of ScCl3 alkylation (Reaction 11-5). The rate of 
this reaction rapidly decreases with time [70], which is a characteristic of many 
topochemical processes. 
Another reaction which accompanies Reaction 11-6 is the fixation of or-
ganoaluminum compounds on the TiCl3 surface. It has been assumed [68-70] 
that only AIMe3 (but not AIMe2CI formed in Reaction 11-6) interacts with the 
surface and is adsorbed on it. If this inference is correct the balance between the 
amounts ofTi atoms on the TiCl3 surface, Al atoms, and Me groups indicates that 
the principal product of Reaction 11-6 has an average composition Ti2CIsMe, i.e., 
for every two Ti atoms on the surface (both together initally having three chlorine 
atoms situated above them in a layer, see Fig. II-I) one has now a methyl group. 
These metal-alkyl bonds on the TiCl3 surface do not exist for a long time. Most of 
them (63% in 155 s, 77% in 1180 s) interact further with AIMe3 resulting in the 
formation of complexes with the average composition Ti2CIsAIMe4, i.e., the 
complexation reaction takes place. These two reactions, those of alkylation and 
AIMe3 complexation, jointly result in a significant heat evolution, about 10 kcal per 
mole of the organoaluminum compound involved [71]. The Ti2CIsAIMe4 com-
plexes decompose slowly with methane evolution (approximately two molecules per 
each complex) and with the formation of products TiCI2AIC2.3Hs.2 [68, 
69]-TiCl2AIC2H4 [70]. 
Careful chemical and structural examination of these surface complexes showed 
that they most probably can be approximated by structural formula 11-7 
(11-7) 

112 
II: Chemistry and Functioning of Heterogeneous Catalysts 
in which both methyl groups are connected to an Al atom and one of the Ti atoms is 
apparently reduced to the 1 + valency. One of the methyl groups is sterically 
exposed on the TiCl3 surface and has substantial reactivity: it can be exchanged with 
other organometallic compounds, for example, AI(CD3h, whereas the second 
methyl group is sterically hindered and does not participate in the exchange reac-
tion. Complexes II-7 cover all basal planes of IX-TiCl3 and according to Ref. [68, 69, 
72, 73] they are not catalytically active when exposed to a gaseous monomer 
(propylene). 4 
In a similar reaction between r/.-TiCl3 and AlEt3 vapor at 65Â°C most of the AlEt3 
is transformed after 60 min into AlEt2 CI due to an alkylation reaction similar to 
Reaction 11-6. Both proposed surface complexes, Ti2Cl5Et and Ti2C15AlEt4 , de-
compose more easily in the reduction reaction than the corresponding methyl 
derivatives. The principal products of the reduction reaction are ethane and ethyl-
ene [68.69,71]. Evolving ethylene usually polymerizes on the active centers formed 
in the TiCI3-AIEt3 reaction [74-76]. 
II-2-b. 
Interaction between Catalysts and Co-catalysts in Hydrocarbon 
Suspension 
Chemical aspects of the interaction between MCl3 and organometallic compounds 
have been studied by many authors [33, 71,77-84]. Interaction between IX-TiCI3 and 
a hydrocarbon solution of AIR3 (AlEt3, Ali-Bu3) at [AIR3] : [TiCI3] ratios of2-2.5 
results in a rapid transfer of some chlorine atoms into the solution (in the form of 
AIR2 CI), i.e., a rapid exchange reaction takes place similar to that found in the 
"dry" systems (Reaction 11-6) [33, 78-82]: 
(11-8) 
The conversion in this reaction depends strongly on three parameters: So of 
TiCI3, the concentration of AIR3 in solution, and temperature. When unground 
TiCl3 samples with low So were used and the temperature did not exceed 70Â°C, the 
amount of chlorine released in solution was not high and increased slowly with time 
(see Fig. II-8). If one compares the amount of chlorine atoms which went into 
solution (0.3-0.5% of all CI in IX-TiCI3 with So = 4.8 m 2jg at 30-70Â°C) and the 
fraction of chlorine atoms on the TiCl3 surface5 (ca. 0.4%), it is evident that 
practically all surface chlorine atoms are removed even in the first few minutes of the 
interaction and that significant destruction of the crystal surface subsequently takes 
place as the additional chlorine is released. The substantial increase of chlorine 
release at 90Â°C for such samples (see Fig. 11-8) after'" 1 h of reaction approximately 
coincides with the beginning of catalyst deactivation. This is typical even for stable

catalysts of low activity and is accompanied by catalyst dispersion: So increases 
from ca. 5 to 12.2 m2/g [79]. 
When finely ground TiCl3 samples (So = 145.5 m2/g) are treated with AIR3 
solution the quantity of chlorine released in solution is larger than that for the 
unground samples for two reasons: (a) the higher surface area of the ground samples 
makes a larger amount of surface chlorine available for reaction (12% for So = 150 
m2/g); and (b) the finely ground TiCl3 samples have increased reactivity. For such 
TiCl3 samples, all surface chlorine atoms are released in solution even at 1O-30Â°C 
and at 70Â°C up to 50% of all chlorine atoms in the TiCl3 samples become linked with 
Al in the form of AlEt2CI (see Fig. II-9). The admittance of monomer into the 
system and the beginning of polymerization decreases the amount of chlorine 
released to 20-30% but does not halt it completely. 
Thus the first difference between the "dry" and suspension systems in the case of 
the TiCI3-AIR3 interaction involves the conversion in Reactions II-6-II-8: only 
33% of all surface CI is removed from the TiCl3 surface in "dry" systems even in the 
case of highly dispersed TiCl3 samples whereas in suspension at least all surface CI 
atoms are removed practically at once. The same effect was found in the reaction 
between VCl3 and Ali-Bu3 [85, 86]. A similar reaction takes place between TiCl3 and 
AIEt2 CI but the amount of surface CI exchanged in this case is more difficult to 
measure due to the problem of the small change in the [AI] : [CI] ratio in AlEt2 CI

solution [83, 84]. Reaction 11-8 leaves alkyl groups bound to Ti or V atoms on the 
catalyst surface. Their amount was estimated (after washing out organoaluminum 
products adsorbed on the surface) by the application of Ale4C2Hsh [77]-see 
column 5 in Table 11-3. 
The second chemical reaction in suspension systems is also similar to that found 
for "dry" systems: organometallic compounds are fixed on the catalyst surface [77, 
79-82]. The amount of these adsorbed products depends on the reaction conditions. 
When they are mild, only 1.2-2.9% of all Ti atoms bear aluminum complexes [82] 
which are most probably situated on the catalyst surface. When reaction tempera-
ture is high (90-110Â°C), this amount increases to 24% (unground a-TiCI3 , 90Â°C, 
4 h) [81] or even to 43% (finely ground a-TiCI3 , 50Â°C, 4 h) [79]. These are conditions

characteristic for significant catalyst deactivation and they can result in a substan-
tial transformation of the catalyst crystalline structure, particle agglomeration, and 
a decrease in So [79]. 
The estimation of the [R] : [AI] ratio in these complexes is very vague (both Ti and 
adsorbed Al species contain alkyl groups) but usually the ratio between the total R 
content (Et, i-Bu, etc.) and the amount of adsorbed Al is 1.5-2.3 [80-82], i.e., the 
adsorbed aluminum species are most probably AlEt2 CI or even AlEtC12. The direct 
experimental confirmation of this conjecture was presented in Ref. [71]. When [3-
TiCl3 was formed in the reaction between TiCl4 and AlEt3 (heptane, 30Â°C, 30 min), 
separated from the liquid phase, and dried at 40Â°C, it contained a significant 
amount of adsorbed organoaluminum compounds which could be removed from 
the TiCl3 surface by repeated washings using pure heptane as a solvent. The first 
washings contained AlEtz CI and in the course of the tenth washing AlEtCl2 was 
removed from the surface. These washings did not destroy Ti-Et bonds on the 
catalyst surface: the washed solid retained catalytic activity (see Section II-4-d). 
The third important catalyst reaction in suspended systems is gas evolution. 
When AlEt3 is applied the evolving gas is mostly ethane and in the case of Ali-Bu3 
both isobutane and isobutene are formed [33, 8S, 86]. The amount of the gases is 
significant: in the case of the Ali-Bu3-<5-TiCI3 system at 30Â°C the molar ratio 
between the evolved isobutane and surface CI atoms is ca. 1 whereas in the case of 
the Ali-Bu3 - VCl3 system it is ca. S, clearly indicating that the original alkylation 
process encompassed the whole of the catalyst surface [8S, 86]. The source of these 
gases is the decomposition of organometallic compounds on the catalyst surface 
with reduction of the transition metal 
(II-9) 
Ethylene formed in Reaction 11-9 easily polymerizes under these conditions to 
polyethylene or, if some other monomers are present in the system, copolymerizes 
with them [74, 7S]. On the other hand, isobutene is not polymerized by 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts but can be polymerized by acidic impurities (AICI3) in them 
[33]. If such impurities are absent (in VCI3) the [i-C4HS] : [i-C4H 10] ratio is very 
close to 1 [85, 86]. When Reaction 11-9 is carried out under mild conditions ( ,,;; 70Â°C, 
low [AI] : [Ti] ratios, low AIR3 concentrations) the conversion in this reaction is low 
[33, 66] but it becomes significant at high temperatures and in the case of highly 
dispersed TiCl3. For example, at 80-90Â°C for 2 h the TiCl3 reduction proceeds to 
30-3S% [33, 81] and a substantial decrease of catalyst activity always results [77, 87, 
88]. AlEt2 CI practically does not reduce 0(-TiC13 in the SO-lOOÂ°C range [66]. In 
VCI3-AIR3 systems [89, 90] AlEt3 also reduces VCl3 to VCl2 at temperatures higher 
than SOÂ°C whereas AlEt2I practically does not reduce VCl3 even at 90Â°C. The 
reducing power of organometallic compounds in their reaction with VCl3 at 90Â°C 
decreases in the order: 

116 
II: Chemistry and Functioning of Heterogeneous Catalysts 
This order does not correlate with the activity of these compounds in propylene 
polymerization [90]. 
The mechanism of Reaction 11-9 is obscure. Most probably it does not involve 
free radical formation but proceeds via dialkylated derivatives of transition metals. 
There also exists a second possible source of olefin evolution from heterogeneous 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts; it is equivalent to the spontaneous chain termination 
reaction (Reaction 1-7) [76]: 
(11-10) 
The process of dealkylation of the alkyl derivatives of transition metals on the 
catalyst surface never goes to completion. Some of these derivatives remain on the 
surface even after long aging of the catalysts. They can be observed directly if 14C_ 
labeled organoaluminum compounds are used in the reaction (see later) or in-
directly, by their reactions. One such reaction is the displacement of the alkyl group 
(in the form of an olefin) by another olefin molecule. For example, if styrene or IX-
methylstyrene are added to the aged Ali-Bu3- TiCl3 or Ali-Bu3- VC13 system at low 
temperatures, additional isobutene is released immediately (apart from the olefin 
formed in Reaction 11-9) [85, 86]: 
Newly formed transition metal styryl species were identified (in the case of IX-
methyl styrene) by their reaction with tritiated methanol with the formation of 
labeled cumene [85, 86]. The amount of displaced isobutene in the case of the TiCl3 
sample with So = 20.5 m2/g was found to be 2.6 x 10-3 mol/mol TiCl3 indicating 
that the amount of Ti-i-Bu bonds on the catalyst surface constituted ca. 10% of 
the total Ti atom content of the surface. Similar results were found in the case of the 
VC13-derived catalytic system. 
These undecomposed alkyl derivatives of transition metals constitute initiation 
centers of heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts, as discussed in Chapter I, and the 
displacement method described in Refs. [85] and [86] represents a convenient 
technique for their quantification. 
When a monomer is admitted to the preformed catalyst and polymerization 
begins, the alkyl groups bound to the catalyst surface are incorporated into polymer 
chains as end-groups. This process was definitely proved when 13C_ and 14C-labeled 
organoaluminum compounds were used for the catalyst preparation [43, 91, 92]: see 
Table 11-3 and Chapter V. Careful kinetic studies [91, 92] showed that the amount of 
labeled groups present in the polymer gradually increased with time (Fig. 11-10). 
There are two reasons for this increase: (a) chain transfer to an organometallic 
compound (in this case a labeled compound, Reaction 1-6) and (b) copolymeriza-
tion with 14C-labeled ethylene, the minor product of the decomposition of labeled 
organotitanium compounds (Reactions 11-9 and 11-10) [76]. Ethylene is the most 
active of all olefins in the polymerization reaction and practically all ethylene

formed in the decomposition reactions incorporates into polyolefin chains [74-76]. 
This copolymerization effect is especially pronounced when the olefins used for 
polymerization have low activity,like 3-methyl-I-butene [70] or styrene [75]. Direct 
measurements showed that in such cases every polyolefin molecule contains more 
than one or two labeled groups [75] (usually from 5-6 to 60) which restricts the 
application of the 14C-Iabeled organometallic compounds in active center measure-
ments to ethylene and propylene polymerizations [76]. In such cases the ordinate 
intercept in Fig. 1-10 corresponds to the total concentration of active centers in a 
catalytic system. The estimations of these concentrations presented in Refs. [77], 
[90], and [91] are compared in Section 11-6 with analogous data obtained by other 
methods and with estimations of the active center concentration that are based on kp 
measurements (Sections 1-3 and 1-4). 
The following qualitative picture of the interaction between transition metal 
halides and organometallic compounds can be envisaged from the data presented 
above. Unground MCl3 samples when mixed with solutions of AlEt3 or AlEt2CI 
under conditions typical for olefin polymerization (0-80Â°C, [AI] : [M] ratios from 1 
to 10) undergo a mild reaction that is restricted mostly to their surface. This 
interaction includes three main reactions: (a) substitution of chlorine atoms on the 
MCl3 surface by alkyl groups, i.e., the formation of organic derivatives of the 
transition metals; (b) partial destruction of these organometallic compounds result-
ing in the liberation of gaseous products and transition metal reduction; and (c) 
complexation between the remaining surface alkyl derivatives of the transition 
metals and the organoaluminum compounds present in solution. These three reac-
tions are sufficient for the formation of active centers capable of polymerizing 
olefins stereospecifically, but the role of the second and the third reactions in the 
formation of the polymerization centers is not as evident as that of the alkylation 
process. Whereas the quantitative dependencies will be discussed below, it is perti-
nent to say here that abundant complexation (existing, for example, in "dry" 

118 
II: Chemistry and Functioning of Heterogeneous Catalysts 
systems) and substantial transition metal reduction (at high temperatures) can 
dramatically reduce the catalytic activity. 
When highly dispersed TiCl3 samples are used in combination with organoalum-
inurn compounds (typical components of commercial catalytic systems) the rates of 
all these reactions increase drastically. This influences the catalytic activity in two 
ways. On one hand, the presence of numerous defects in the ground solids induces 
easy cleavage of the crystals with the formation of fresh surfaces and an increase in 
the catalytic activity. On the other hand, the increase in the rate of the reduction 
reaction results in instability of the centers. Apparently this phenomenon is the 
principal reason for the decay-type polymerization kinetics that are characteristic of 
highly active catalytic systems like b-TiCI3-AlEt3 (see Section I-2-c). 
A more complicated situation was found in the case of highly active supported 
catalysts for olefin polymerization. As a typical example, MgCl2-containing 
catalyst can be examined [93]. The original solid catalyst is produced by TiCl4 
deposition on specially prepared, finely ground MgCl2 (So = 50-200 m2 jg) contain-
ing admixtures of ethyl benzoate and p-cresol. The treatment is carried out at 100Â°C 
and results in the deposition of2-4 wt. % ofTi. More than 50% of the Ti remains in 
a tetravalent state, the rest being reduced to Ti3+ (38%) and even TF+ (8%). The 
reduction occurs due to the interaction of TiCl4 with admixtures of organic com-
pounds present in the MgCI2 â¢ 
When such a catalyst is treated with a mixture containing AlEt3 and methyl p-
toluate (the mixture has a 3: 1 molar composition and contains free AlEt3, its 
complex with the ester, and aluminum alkoxides) significant reduction of titanium 
occurs: the Ti4+ level decreases to 8% and the Ti3+ level increases to 75%. These Ti 
ions exist in two identifiable states. About one third of them are isolated on the 
MgCl2 surface (they exhibit a specific ESR signal) while the rest form associates of 
different size which can be viewed as very small TiCl3 crystallites. 
11-3. 
Attempts to Study Active Centers Directly 
The exceptional importance of direct spectroscopic methods (IR and electronic 
spectra, X-ray, ESR, ESCA, etc.) for the study of heterogeneous catalysts is 
generally recognized both for the elucidation of the active center structure and for 
the examination of reagent and product adsorption. In addition to the numerous 
studies of alumina and silica by the IR method and of transition metal oxides by the 
IR and ESR methods, there have been significant achievements in IR studies of 
olefin adsorption on metals and metal oxides, in which it proved possible to 
distinguish between physical adsorption and two main types of chemisorption-
those due to associative and dissociative mechanisms [94-98]. It is natural that 
many efforts have been made to study heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts by 
these direct methods. 
Unfortunately, these efforts up to now have brought no significant breakthrough 
in the study of active center structures and their interaction with olefins. There are 
some apparent technical reasons for this. First, the usual solid catalyst components 

II-3: Attempts to Study Active Centers Directly 
119 
(TiCl3, VCl3, etc.) strongly absorb in most of the visible and IR range which 
prevents the use of thick layers of these substances in spectroscopic studies. Second, 
the suspected active centers of these catalysts-alkyl derivatives of transition metals 
and their complexes with organometallic compounds-have no adequate models of 
known structure and their main absorption bands in IR spectra lie in the far-IR 
region (lower than 700 cm- 1 [99]) where many other substances absorb, contrary, 
for example, to the 0-Hand C-H stretching regions that are free of such overlap. 
The first target of these spectroscopic studies was the investigation of the 
interaction between MCl3 species and organoaluminum compounds. Studies of the 
model system TiCl4 - M'Rx were very encouraging in this respect [100-103]. In-
frared spectra of these systems demonstrated conclusively the equilibrium form-
ation ofTiCl3R both in the gas phase [100] and in heptane and CC14 solutions [101]. 
A similar reaction between TiC13 dissolved in tetrahydrofuran and AlMe3 or 
AlMez Cl also resulting in Cl exchange was shown to occur by NMR and IR studies 
[102]. Unfortunately, no NMR parameters of the TiClzMe species were measured 
due to a drastic broadening of the signals of the methyl groups attached to the 
paramagnetic titanium atoms. 
When the reaction between p-TiCl3 and AIMe3 was studied in a "dry" system 
[104], the IR spectra of the products contained some IR bands which were assigned 
to chemisorbed AlMezCl in the form of complex 11-7. The spectrum of this product 
was in general very similar to that of the AIMezCl dimer. Similar features were found 
in the spectrum of the P-TiCl3-AlMezCl system whereas the spectrum of the p-
TiCl3-Al(CD3h system was close to that of the Al(CD3hCl dimer. The similarity 
between the spectra of these surface products and those of AlMez Cl invites the 
alternative interpretation that these IR data are due to the AlMez Cl dimer chemi-
sorbed on defects of the TiCl3 surface that is etched by its interaction with AlMe3 or 
AlMezCl. 
Whatever the structure of these complexes, they do not polymerize olefins: the 
admittance of ethylene to the "dry" system results in superposition of the spectra of 
these unchanged complexes and polyethylene [105, 106]. No definite manifestation 
of Ti-C bond formation was found in the spectra of the p-TiC13-AlMe3 system 
when TiCl3 Me was used as a model for the interpretation of the IR spectra [104]. 
The only apparent hint concerning such bond formation appeared when the interac-
tion ofTiCl3Me and Hz was studied [104-106]. TiCl3Me is readily reduced by Hz 
with the formation of a brown powder which is characterized by the 1370 cm -1 band 
in its IR spectrum. This was assigned to the methyl deformation mode of the Ti-
CH3 bond. The admittance of Cz D 4 to this system results in a significant decrease 
of this band intensity and in the appearance (in addition to polyethylene-D4 bands) 
of a new band at 986 cm -1 which was assigned to the a-C-p-C stretching mode of 
a Ti-C-C group. These data can be explained by the following reactions: 
A second attempt to study the "dry" p-TiC13-containing system was described in

Ref. [107]. It was found that the interaction of highly dispersed /3-TiCl3 with gaseous 
AIEt3, Ali-Bu3' and Ali-Bu2 Cl results in the formation of nonvolatile surface 
products that cannot polymerize isoprene. However, the admittance ofTiCl4 vapor 
to these complexes produces active centers for isoprene polymerization. 
Another approach to the direct study of the active centers of heterogeneous 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts was based on the ESR method [32-34, 108-112]. In spite of 
the fact that TiCl3 contains paramagnetic Ti atoms, samples of un ground a-TiCl3 at 
20Â°C have no signals in their ESR spectra due to fast spin-lattice interactions in 
the crystals [32] or to Ti-Ti dipolar coupling [113]. Mechanical breaking of the 
crystals produces numerous lattice defects which manifest themselves in the ap-
pearance of signals with a g-factor of 1.93-1.94 [33,34, 110] (Fig. II-II). The same 
signals were found in the spectra of all commercial highly active TiCl3 samples. The 
intensity of the signals strongly increases when AICl3 co-crystallizes with TiCl3 in 
the catalyst synthesis stage (see Section II-I-a) [112]. Moreover, the treatment of any 
TiCl3 sample with AIEt2Cl or AIEt3 gives rise to similar (g = 1.93-1.94) signals 
from the solid precipitates in addition to a strong liquid-phase signal at g = 1.972 
[109, 111]. This increases with time and is attributed to a soluble complex of AIEt3 
with TiCl4 that is occluded in the bulk of the TiCI3. A similar signal was found in the 
liquid-phase spectrum of the TiCIcAIEt3 system [109]. Purified TiCl3 samples do 
not produce this intense liquid-phase signal when treated with AIEt3 but only a 
small signal at g = 1.972 in the solid phase [110]. In the case of the a-TiCI3-Ali-Bu3 
system the new solid phase signal is at g = 1.98 [33]. 
Thus, the ESR studies of active center formation reveal no significant structural 
features of these centers apart from one general effect (a signal at g = 1.93-1.98) 
indicative of TiCl3 lattice defects, probably chlorine deficiency. However, the 
admittance of olefins to these systems results in the appearance of a new intense 
signal of an intermediate width at g = 1.97 [110]. The intensity of this new signal 
correlates with the polymerization activity of the catalytic systems containing TiCl3

The same signal was found in the spectrum ofthe TiCI3-AlEtzCl-acetylene system 
[Ill]. We also found a similar signal in the spectrum of the b-TiCI3-AlEt3-ethylene 
system at 20Â°e. 
Unfortunately, these data give practically no information on the structure of the 
active centers. The appearance of a new signal in the presence of olefins can be 
explained: (a) as the manifestation of olefin participation in the process of active 
center formation due to their direct involvement in its structure or (b) to a chemical 
reaction with a potential center, for example, in the initiation stage. 
A detailed ESR study of a MgClz-based supported catalyst for olefin polymeriz-
ation has been reported [113]. The solid component of this catalyst, TiC14/MgClz 
(obtained by ball-milling MgClz with ethyl benzoate followed by reactions with p-
cresol, AlEt3, and TiCI4 ), contains ca. 30% of all its Ti atoms in the 3 + state. 
Twenty percent of these Ti3+ species are observable by the ESR method. They 
represent isolated Ti ions on the catalyst surface with a trigonally distorted octa-
hedral (D3h) ligand field symmetry. The remaining 80% of the Ti3+ ions cannot be 
detected by this method, probably because of a very strong line broadening due to 
dipolar coupling or to super-exchange interactions. These species can be visualized 
as Ti3+ clusters on the catalyst surface or as micro-fragments of the TiCl3 lattice 
bound to the crystallographically similar MgClz lattice. When this solid reacts with 
an AlEt3 solution, at least three new Ti3+ species are formed, which are attributed to 

122 
II: Chemistry and Functioning of Heterogeneous Catalysts 
isolated Ti3+ ions in centers of different symmetry. These species are sensitive to the 
presence of propylene, the same effect as described earlier for the TiCl3-based 
catalysts. If an AlEt3-aromatic ester mixture (molar ratio 3 : 1) is used instead of 
pure AlEt3 the reduction ofTi4 + to Ti3+ is milder. Only one dominant type ofTi3+ 
species is formed. It has rhombic symmetry, is unstable at polymerization tempera-
tures, and is rapidly transformed (during 10 min at 50Â°C) into another Ti3+ species 
with axial symmetry. Again, the information obtained for the supported catalysts is 
not sufficient for the elucidation of the detailed structure of polymerization centers 
and cannot be correlated with the polymerization kinetics. 
11-4. 
Organometallic Compounds and Catalyst Activity 
The role of organometallic compounds is one of the most complicated problems in 
understanding the phenomenon of Ziegler-Natta catalysis. These compounds play 
a vital role in catalyst formation. On the other hand, it was definitely demonstrated 
that as far as kinetically stable catalysts are concerned, variation of the con-
centration of organometallic compounds over a very wide range virtually does not 
influence the catalyst activity. For example, according to different estimations, the 
[AI] : [Ti] ratio range over which no substantial influence of AlEt3 concentration on 
the TiCI3-AlEt3 system activity exists is 1-8.5 [77], 0.3-10 [114], 1-5 [87, 88], 
0.31-5.4 [115]. A similar absence of the influence of organometallic compound 
concentration on olefin polymerization rate was also found for polymerization of 1-
butene [116], I-pentene [117], and styrene [115, 118]. 
This effect is characteristic only for stable heterogeneous systems of relatively 
low activity whereas highly active unstable systems and most supported catalysts 
exhibit a significant dependence of their activity on the organometallic compound 
concentration. This behavior is usually connected with their instability with time. 
It is evident from the data presented in Section II-2 that organometallic com-
pounds can in principle influence catalytic activity in many ways: 
(i) Their amount and properties can influence the kinetics of active center for-
mation and the number of centers formed. 
(ii) These compounds can directly influence the concentration and activity of the 
active centers, provided they participate in their structure. 
(iii) Organometallic compounds not only form active centers but can decrease their 
concentration as well, by means of the reduction of transition metal complexes 
or the formation of catalytic poisons. 
(iv) Organometallic compounds are effective scavengers of impurities in poly-
merization media. All heterogeneous Ziegler-N atta catalysts are very sensitive 
to many impurities that may be present in monomers or in solvents (see Section 
II-5) and organometallic compounds decrease the level of these impurities 
(including water, Oz, etc.) in a reaction medium. 
All these problems will be discussed in the following sections of this chapter.

11-4-a. 
Organometallic Compounds and Center Formation 
The initial interaction of transition metal halides with organometallic compounds 
apparently manifests itself in the existence of induction stages and acceleration 
periods in the polymerization kinetics. A quantitative description of these pheno-
mena was presented in Section 1-2-b.1t is evident from the data discussed there that 
the total polymerization initiation step can be subdivided into two proces:>es: (a) a 
monomolecular reaction resulting in the formation of active centers and (b) the 
initiation reaction itself which proceeds with monomer participation (see Reactions 
1-27). If this formal kinetic scheme is compared with the chemical data presented in 
Section 11-2 it can be suggested that the reaction of center formation is the sum of 
different interactions between the MCl3 species and organometallic compounds: the 
alkylation reaction, complex formation between alkylated transition metal species 
and organometallic compounds etc. The overall kinetic characteristics of this 
process in the case of (X-TiCl3 and VCl3 are presented in Table 1-5. The duration of 
the inital period of the center generation strongly depends on the activity of the 
organometallic compounds. For example, when CH3 TiCl3 was used as an organo-
metallic compound6 in combination with (X-TiCI3 and P-TiCI3 at 40Â°C for 
ethylene polymerization, the "induction" period lasted for ca. 6 h after which the 
acceleration process developed and eventually a stable catalytic system was formed 
[119]. 
The importance of this sequence of reactions for the center formation raises a 
question: are the reaction conditions used for the interaction between transition 
metal halides and organometallic compounds adequate for the development of the 
maximum possible amount of potential active centers on the surface of a given 
catalyst? If this condition is not met it is quite possible that the decreased activity of 
a particular catalytic system has no direct connection with the properties of the 
organometallic compound used as the component of the active centers but merely 
can be attributed to inadequate or insufficient interaction between the catalyst 
components prior to monomer admittance to the system. 
Following this type of reasoning, the well-known reduced activity of the catalytic 
systems MX3-AlEt2CI compared to the systems MX3-AlEt3 can be explained as 
the result of one of the following circumstances: 
(i) The reaction conditions are inadequate in the case of the MX3-AlEt2CI 
systems for the formation of the maximum possible (for a given MX3 surface 
area) number of potential active centers. 
(ii) The number of potential active centers in the two systems in close but real active 
centers are formed as a result ofthe equilibrium adsorption of organometallic 
compounds on potential active centers and the complexation power of AlEt2 CI 
is lower. 
(iii) Both systems possess roughly the same amount of real active centers but the 
6 CH3 TiCl3 in a pure state does not polymerize olefins but can decompose with formation of p-TiCl3 and 
acts as a co-catalyst for it [119].

centers containing complexed AlEt2 Cl have lower activity (lower k p ) than the 
centers containing AlEt3. 
Whereas the discrimination between the last two possibilities represents one of 
the most difficult problems of heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysis (see later in 
this chapter and Chapter I), the evaluation of the first possibility can be made on the 
basis of published data. The most straightforward method to do this is to study 
catalyst aging without monomer using the same conditions as are employed in 
polymerization runs. Detailed experimental data on this subject have been pub-
lished [30, 77, 120-122]. They refer to the "standard" polymerization conditions: 
temperature in the range of 30-70Â°C and [AI]: [Ti] ratios of 1-15. These experi-
ments revealed two types of effects-catalyst activation with time and catalyst 
deactivation (see next section). The degree of activation depends on the TiCl3 type, 
the type of organometallic compound, and temperature. In the case of the b-TiCI3-
AlEt3 system the activation effect is usually small (not higher than 30%), the 
only exception being ethylene polymerization at 50Â°C where it exceeds 70% [120], 
whereas for the stable ex-TiCI-AIEt3 system aging does not improve the catalyst 
performance at all [77]. In the case of the b-TiCI3-AlEt2Cl system the activation 
effect is more pronounced and depends on the [AI] : [Ti] ratio [120, 121]. When it is 
small (2-3) the activation effect can be equal to 70- 100%, whereas at high [AI] : [Ti] 
ratios (10-15) it does not exceed 20- 30%. Thus, substantial kinetic effects in the 
interaction of MCl3 with organometallic compounds undoubtedly exist, especially 
in the case of highly active catalysts. However, they are not large enough to explain 
exclusively the intrinsic differences between different catalytic systems (for example, 
the b-TiCI3-AlEt3 system is ca. 8 times more active in propylene polymerization 
than the b-TiC13-AlEt2 Cl system) which are mostly of an equilibrium nature. Data 
on the variation of catalyst activity with temperature in the course of a single run 
were published both for ethylene polymerization [123-125] (see Fig. II-l3) and 

II-4: Organometallic Compounds and Catalyst Activity

propylene polymerization [123, 126] in the 30-60Â°C and 40-70Â°C ranges. They 
proved that the equilibrium quantity of active centers does not change irreversibly 
with temperature. Thus, it can be supposed that in this temperature range most of 
the usually used organometallic compounds are active enough to produce practi-
cally all potential active centers on the catalyst surface for a relatively short time. 
However, the preliminary interaction between catalyst components at elevated 
temperatures sometimes does increases the catalyst activity very substantially [83, 
84]. For example, such dramatic increases were found for: 
(i) the b-TiCI3-AlEt2CI system at 95-135Â°C for 60 min (2-2.3 times), 
(ii) the b-TiCI3-AlEt1.5CI1.5 system at 95Â°C for 60 min (3.8 times), 
(iii) the a-TiC13 (H2 reduced)-AlEt3 system at 95Â°C for 60 min (2.2 times), 
whereas a similar treatment of pure b-TiCl3 gave no noticeable effect and the 
activity of the b-TiC13-AlEt3 system was reduced (all data on catalyst activity were 
obtained during subsequent propylene polymerization at 50Â°C). One of the possible 
explanations for the apparent differences between the cited data may lie in the fact 
that in the 95-135Â°C temperature range the interaction between the transition metal 
halides and the organometallic compounds is much stronger (see Section II-2-b) 
and can lead to an increase of catalyst So due to lattice splitting that is unobservable 
at lower temperatures or for more chemically stable solids. 
II-4-b. 
Destruction of Active Centers by Organometallic Compounds 
Numerous studies have demonstrated that in many cases organometallic com-
pounds not only form active centers but can decrease their quantity as well. These 
phenomena are especially pronounced in the case of highly active and supported 
catalysts and they are partly responsible for the instability of these catalysts. 
Two different effects have to be distinguished: (a) an irreversible destruction of 
active centers (mainly due to the reduction reaction described in Section II-2) and 
(b) the reversible poisoning of active centers by the products of organometallic 
compound transformations. 
According to Ref. [122] the decrease in catalyst activity in the case of propylene 
polymerization with the highly dispersed a-TiC13 (So = 80 m2/g)-AlEt3 system is 
independent of monomer presence and is due to TiCl3 reduction (Fig. II-14). A 
similar effect, strong catalyst deactivation with time, is usually noticed for poly-
merization with the highly active b-TiC13-AlEt3 system [108, 120]. Kinetic behavior 
of the VCI3-Ali-Bu3 system in the propylene polymerization reaction at 60Â°C [123] 
is explained similarly as VCl3 reduction to VCl2 (see Fig. II-15). An increase in the 
concentration of organoluminum compounds accelerates VCl3 reduction which 
results in instability of the catalytic system and in a decrease of the maximum 
attainable polymerization rate. 
A similar reduction reaction takes place even in the case of relatively stable 
catalytic systems, i.e., a-TiCI3-AlEt3' when the components interact at increased 
concentrations [83, 84, 127] (see Fig. II-16). When a mixture of a-TiC13 (So = 7

monomer in propane medium, some part of the initially formed active centers was 
destroyed and the effective polymerization constant (measured after addition of 5 
volumes of propylene to the system, at 70Â°C) was decreased. It is interesting that the 
polymerization rate in all these experiments was nearly constant for 1-2 h after 
propylene addition, independently of the preceding aging effect. Two explanations 
can be given for the apparent paradox that the system decays during the aging stage 
but is stable during subsequent polymerization at the same temperature: 
(i) A fivefold decrease of the AIEt3 concentration at the beginning of the poly-
merization stage. 
(ii) The polymer formed on the catalyst causes a specific protection effect.

The apparent decrease of the TiCI3-AlEt3 interaction rate in the presence of 
monomer was mentioned earlier (Section II-2-b). 
A fundamentally different deactivation effect of organometallic compounds on 
olefin polymerization was described in the case of catalytic systems containing 
AlEt2 Cl. The reducing power of this compound is lower than that of AIR3 and when 
it is used in combination with a-TiC13 [6] or VCl3 [89], the catalytic systems are 
relatively stable. However, when AlEt2CI is used in combination with highly active 
b-TiCI3, the polymerization rate usually decreases with time [6, 128]. This effect was 
attributed [128] to the interference of AICl3 which is usually present in significant 
amounts in these b-TiCl3 samples. When, during the course of propylene polymeriz-
ation with the b-TiCI3-AlEt2CI system, the solution over the catalyst is removed 
and fresh AlEt2CI is added to the catalyst, the reaction rate increases stepwise (see 
Fig. II -17). On the other hand, addition of AlEtCl2 to the polymerization system 
always results in a rate decrease (Fig. II-17).1t was suggested [128] that this catalytic

system contains a "built-in" inhibitor precursor (AlC13) and that AIEtC12 forma-
tion proceeds in the system as follows: 
Addition of substances producing stable complexes of AIEtC12 (e.g., NaCl) or 
transformation of AlEtC12 back to AIEt2Cl (i.e., in reaction with K [Et2AlC12] or 
AIEt3) gives one the possibility to maintain high and stable activity [128, 129]. This 
explanation is by no means the only possible one. For example, J-TiC13-AlEt2Br 
catalytic systems usually exhibit a fairly stable (however low) activity in spite of the 
possibility of AIEtClBr formation in the reaction between AlC13 and AIEt2Br [6]. 
Nevertheless, the possibility of the reversible poisoning of active centers by some 
organometallic compounds has to be taken into account. Some related data are 
presented in Section II-4-e. 
ll-4-c. 
Organometallic Compounds as Impurity Scavengers 
Everyday practice of all workers in the field of Ziegler-Natta catalysts gives many 
examples of the extreme sensitivity of the active species to the majority of chemical 
compounds and of the important role of organometallic compounds as impurity 
scavengers. Many examples of these reactions are presented in Section II-5. Among 
well-known phenomena of this type is the disappearance of induction periods in 
olefin polymerization with the increase of organometallic compound concentration 
in a reaction medium. This effect is especially pronounced at low temperatures. As 
was discussed earlier (Section 1-2-b), prolonged acceleration curves of the S-shape 
can be regarded as the manifestation of the removal of different catalytic poisons 
from the catalyst surface via their reactions with organometallic compounds. 
As one of the most striking examples of this sensitivity ofZiegler-Natta catalysts 
to impurities in a polymerization medium, it is pertinent to mention here a closely 
related subject, ethylene polymerization with the soluble catalytic system 
(CsHsh TiClr AIEt2Cl in an aromatic hydrocarbon medium. After twenty years 
of careful study of the polymerization kinetics and the mechanism of this reaction 
by many workers (see reviews [20, 30, 108]) with largely reproducible and persua-
sive results, it was finally demonstrated that this system, when pure, is virtually 
inactive and that the formerly observed significant activity is due to the presence of a 
minute amount of H20 in the polymerization medium and in the monomer [130, 
131]. These data justify the application of extreme caution in the treatment of 
experimental kinetic data when they are obtained at low concentration of orga-
nometallic compounds.

Organometallic Compounds and the Number and Activity of 
Polymerization Centers 
The usual approach to the study of the influence of organometallic compounds on 
catalytic activity in olefin polymerizations is the study of the effect of the orga-
nometallic compound concentration on catalyst activity in a stationary region of a

kinetic curve in the case of stable catalysts based on 0(-TiCl3 or VCl 3 or on the 
catalyst maximum activity in the case of highly active commercial catalysts. Such 
"activity-concentration" dependencies usually have one of two general forms: 
(i) The polymerization rate increases with an increase of the organometallic com-
pound concentration or with the [MRx] : [TiCI3] ratio up to a certain limit and 
then becomes independent of this concentration (see Fig. II-I 8) [20, 77, 87, 88, 
114, 118, 120, 129, 132-141]. Sometimes, when low concentrations of orga-
nometallic compounds (or low [MRx] : [TiCI3] ratios) are not tested, the prin-
cipal feature of such correlations is the virtual independence of the catalyst 
activity on the organometallic compound concentration [77, 87, 88, 114-118, 
135, 136, 142]. 
(ii) The second typical "activity-concentration" dependence is presented in Fig. II-
19. Here when the organometallic compound concentration or [MRJ: [TiCI3] 
ratio increases, the catalytic activity reaches a maximum and then gradually 
decreases [120,143-151]. 
The concentration dependencies presented in Fig. II-18 are very suggestive of 
Langmuir adsorption curves. Due to this similiarity such correlations have usually 
been regarded as a clear manifestation of a polymerization mechanism according to 
which polymerization centers represent organometallic compounds chemisorbed 
on the surface of a transition metal halide or on some defects on this surface which 
either exist on the initial catalyst surface (for example, on TiCl3 lateral crystal faces 
[17]) or are produced during initial MRx-M'X3 interactions [20, 134, 141, 152]. 
The discussion has been concentrated [20] on the problem of whether 
organoaluminum compounds (most usually used for polymerization) are adsorbed 
as the dimeric forms that exist in solution or as monomeric forms. In the first case, 
the expression for the polymerization rate constant is [20, 141, 152]: 

11-4: Organometallic Compounds and Catalyst Activity

and in the second case [134]:

(11-12) 
where CAl is the organoaluminum compound concentration 7 and K and K' are the 
corresponding adsorption equilibrium constants. 
The values of these equilibrium adsorption constants should depend on the type 
of organometallic compound, the type of transition metal halide, and temperature. 
However, it was discovered that even when all these parameters were similar K 
measured by different authors varied over an extremely wide range. For example, 
for the TiC13-AlEt3 system K estimations gave: 21.2 liter/mol (50Â°C [143]), 60 
liter/mol (57Â°C [20]), and 600 liter/mol (56Â°C [141]). 
The simple mechanistic scheme presented above and described by Eqns. II-II or 
11-12can be questioned from many points of view. The first obvious objection is that 
when low CAl are employed the role of poisonous impurities in the solvent or 
monomer can be substantial. These impurities will destroy some part of the orga-
nometallic compound present in the system which distorts the initial part of the 
adsorption isotherms presented in Figs. 11-18 and 11-19. The second source of CAl 
decrease is the interaction of organoaluminum compounds with the transition metal 
halides. This is especially significant for highly active b-TiC13 samples and for 
supported catalysts (see Section 11-2). For example, when the b-TiC13 - AlEt3 system 
was studied at very low AlEt3 concentration (2.6 x 10-4 mol/liter), not only were 
polymerization rates substantially lower than at higher AlEt3 concentrations but 
the stereoregularity of the polypropylene formed with the catalyst was identical to 
that obtained with the b-TiC13-AlEtzCl system, i.e., nearly all AlEt3 in the system 
reacted with b-TiC13 with the formation of AlEtz Cl [134]. It should be noted that 
when data similar to those presented in Figs. 11-18 and 11-19 are based on polymer 
yields for some constant polymerization duration (a very popular practice in such 
experiments [124, 129, 134]) rather than on polymerization rates, the existence of 
acceleration periods and their dependence on polymerization conditions is not 
taken into account, which can change substantially the "activity versus MRx 
concentration" dependences. 
Many sophisticated experiments have been described for the separation of the 
processes of center formation and functioning. These experiments resulted in sig-
nificant modification of the simple adsorption hypothesis. Some of these experi-
ments are described in this and in the following section. 
As was discussed earlier (Section I-2-b), the initial acceleration stages of olefin 
polymerization using heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts can be interpreted as 
7 Typical solid components of heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts have low adsorption capacities. 
Therefore the decrease of CAl due to adsorption can be neglected and initial concentrations can be used 
for the equilibrium constant calculation.

an overlap of at least two independent processes: (a) active center formation by 
interaction between an organometallic compound and a transition metal halide 
(including MRx adsorption on the catalyst surface) and (b) the initiation reaction 
with monomer participation. According to the adsorption hypothesis presented 
above, the process of catalyst aging in the absence of monomer should result in the 
shortening of the subsequent acceleration period (only the initiation stage remains) 
but stationary polymerization rates (or maximum ones) should remain unchanged 
as soon as the catalytic system composition is the same. However, detailed experi-
ments [120, 121, 153] showed that not only were the acceleration stages shorter or 
completely eliminated but the maximum polymerization rates were substantially 
increased after catalyst aging, probably due to the appearance of new polymeriza-
tion centers. What is more important, the inflection points on plots similar to those 
presented in Fig. 11-18 (the points at which catalyst activity does not change more 
with increase is MRx concentration) moved to lower MRx concentrations or to 
lower [MRx] : [M'Xn] ratios (see Fig. 11-20). This means that adsorption equilibrium 
constants of organometallic compounds on the catalyst surface are in reality much 
higher than those estimated from the usual "rate versus MRx concentration" 
curves, as in Fig. 11-18, i.e., under standard condition all catalyst surface is com-
pletely covered by organometallic compounds. Most characteristic from this point 
of view are data on I-butene polymerization kinetics [153] where the comparison was 
made of two c5-TiCI 3-AlEtzCl systems at 60Â°C, one freshly formed (as is usually 
done in olefin polymerization experiments) and the second containing c5-TiCI 3 
samples that had been pretreated with AlEtz Cl at 60Â°C for 20 h in the absence of 
monomer with the subsequent removal of the AlEtz Cl solution and the washing of 
the solid residue with a pure solvent. The kinetic data are shown in Fig. 11-21. When 
the data for the original (untreated) c5-TiCl3 are analyzed both in terms of poly-l-
butene yield in 1 h (as in Ref. [153] itself) or in terms of initial or maximum 
polymerization rates the same conclusion is evident: AlEtz Cl has relatively poor

data for the pretreated c5-TiCI3 samples (equivalent to prolonged aging) definitely 
show the virtual absence of an effect of AlEtz CI concentration on catalyst activity. 
Thus, according to Ref. [153] the "activity versus MRx concentration" curves for 
untreated TiCl3 samples similar to those shown in Figs. II-18 and 11-21 represent the 
overlap of two phenomena, the irreversible intetaction of c5-TiCl3 with AlEtz Cl and 
the reversible adsorption of AlEtz CI, i.e., the simple adsorption equations 11-11-11-
12 cannot be applied to these data directly. 
The second type of experiments devised to evaluate the lower level of the organo-
metallic compound concentration sufficient for the formation of active centers 
was described in Refs. [77], [87], and [121]. In Fig. 11-22 data are presented for 
ethylene polymerization with a P-TiCI3-AlEtzCI catalyst that was obtained by the

mixing of equimolecular quantities of TiCl4 and AIEt3 at 30Â°C. When this catalytic 
system is used for olefin polymerization its activity gradually decreases with time 
(see the upper curve in Fig. II-22 for ethylene polymerization at 30Â°C and P = I 
atm). When the solid part of the catalyst was separated from the mixture by 
centrifugation and then mixed with the same volume of pure n-heptane the poly-
merization rate remained the same and the catalyst decay rate remained unchanged 
also. This phenomenon is difficult to explain on the basis of a simple adsorption 
hypothesis (Eqns. II-II and II-I2) because the removal of the overwhelming part of 
the AlEt2 CI from the system should result in a substantial desorption ofthe AlEt2 CI 
initially bound to the active centers (and this desorption was indeed observed 
experimentally), and correspondingly in an activity decrease. Two bottom curves in 
Fig. II-22 show the activity of the same catalyst after the third and tenth successive 
washings of the catalyst with pure n-heptane with subsequent addition of fresh n-
heptane to the system. These washings resulted in a gradual decrease of the AlEt2CI 
content in the system: after the third washing only ca. 25% of the initially adsorbed 
AlEt2CI remained in the system and after the tenth washing only ca. 5% remained. 
Nevertheless, at the beginning of these polymerization runs in pure n-heptane the 
initial rate did not decrease in a similar manner: after the third washing the activity 
remained virtually unchanged and after the tenth washing it dropped only to 44%. 
This means that of all the AlEt2Cl present in the initial system, only 5% was 
sufficient to make most of the polymerization centers active. Of course, these 
washings brought significant increases of the catalyst deactivation rate but this 
effect by no means could be explained by desorption phenomena. A desorption 
process is a first-order reaction from the kinetic point of view and the time of its half 
conversion cannot depend on the surface coverage. Rather, this rapid catalyst 
deactivation after the tenth washing can be explained as the result of active center 
poisoning by some impurities in the monomer which are normally neutralized by an 
organometallic compound in solution over a catalyst. 
Another explanation of this fast deactivation process has been suggested [154]: 
the decrease of polymerization rate may be due to the spontaneous chain termi-
nation reaction (Reaction 1-7 in Chapter I): 
Cat-Polymer -+ Cat-H + Polymer 
(II-13) 

II-4: Organometallic Compounds and Catalyst Activity 
135 
If any organometallic compound is present in the system a fast activation reaction 
follows: 
Cat-H + MRx~Cat-R + MHRx- 1 
but in the absence of MRx the reinitiation reaction 
Cat-H + Monomer~Cat-R 
is very slow. 
Finally when the ten-times washed catalyst was mixed with the initial liquid phase 
(AIEtzCI solution) the polymerization activity and stability were completely re-
stored. Similar data were presented for the (j-TiCl3-AlEtz CI catalytic system [128]. 
When the solution containing AlEtz CI was removed from the' system and was 
substituted by a pure solvent the catalytic activity of the catalyst in propylene 
polymerization slowly decreased from the starting point (according to Ref. [128] 
due to catalyst poisoning by AlEtClz) and the addition of fresh AlEtz CI instantly 
restored catalyst activity. 
Additional experiments challenging the simple adsorption hypothesis are de-
scribed in Refs. [152] and [155]. The catalytic systems used were (a) (j-TiCI3-AlEtzX 
(X = Et, I) which are characterized by a significant decrease of catalytic activity 
after a short initial acceleration period (ca. 10 min, see curve A in Fig. 11-23) and (b) 
the stable catalytic systems (j-TiCI3-AlEtzCI and (j-TiCI3-AlEtzBr. In all these 
cases, the solutions over the catalysts, which contained most of the organometallic 
compounds present in the systems, could be removed and after the addition of a 
pure solvent, propylene polymerization continued with virtually unchanged initial 
rate starting at any point on the basic polymerization curve A [152, 155, 156]. The 
rate of catalyst deactivation in such experiments was slightly higher than in the 
presence of AlEt3 solution (see curve B in Fig. 11-23) but the subsequent addition of 
a fresh AlEt3 solution restored the "basic" kinetic curves. 8 However, if a AlEtz CI 
solution was added to the "organometallic compound-free" active system instead of 
the AlEt3 solution (curves C, C' in Fig. 11-23) the polymerization activity sharply fell 
to the level characteristic for the (j-TiCl3-AlEtz CI system (curve D). It is difficult to 
explain the differences in the slopes of curves Band C by a slow desorption of AlEt3 
from the polymerization centers because such desorption cannot be accelerated by 
the addition of another co-catalyst, AlEtzCl. On the other hand, curves C can be 
readily interpreted as a rapid substitution of AlEt3 (remaining on active centers) by 
the added AlEtz Cl. Similar substitution phenomena were described for several 
other pairs: AlEt3 ~ ZnEtz, AlEtzCl ~ CdEtz, AlEt2CI ~ AlEt3 [155]. As was 
discussed earlier the increased rate of catalyst deactivation in the absence of a free 
organometallic compound over a catalyst (see Figs. 11-22, 11-23) can be interpreted 
either as the result of gradual active center poisoning by some impurities present in 
the system or as a spontaneous chain termination reaction with subsequent reactiva-
8 This increased deactivation is especially clearly seen when similar experiments are carried out with the 
potentially stable b-TiCI 3-AlEt2Cl or b-TiCI 3-AlEt2Br catalytic systems [152,155].

tion of the center. In both cases, the rate constant for deactivation should depend 
on the type of organometallic compound and on the amount remaining in the 
system after the washing and its desorption from the catalyst surface. Experimental 
data on the deactivation rates of washed catalysts confirm this suggestion [152, 157]. 
The rapid catalyst deactivation at low organometallic compound concentration 
(Figs. II-22, 11-23) accentuates the significance of the proper choice of kinetic 
parameters for the study of the dependence of catalyst activity on the concentration 
of organometallic compounds. Such studies are mainly concerned with the region of 
very low concentrations where deactivation phenomena are prominent. In these 
cases the initial polymerization rate is the most correct measure of catalytic activity 
rather than polymerization rates measured from some other points of the kinetic 
curves or polymer yields, as in Fig. II-21. 
The main conclusion from the above discussion can be formulated as follows: 
The simple adsorption hypothesis described by Eqns. II-II and 11-12 with the 
equilibrium constants K of the order 50 liter/mol is not adequate for the explanation 
of the experimental data. Significant amounts of organometallic compounds in 
solution are necessary for the maximum activity of many heterogeneous 
Ziegler- Natta catalysts (as shown in Figs. II-18 and II-19). This cannot be inter-
preted as solely related to their low adsorption power and is in effect due to the 
complex combination of many factors that determine the interaction between the 

II-4: Organometallic Compounds and Catalyst Activity 
137 
components of the catalysts. When these interactions involve a significant part of 
a catalyst (in the case of many commercial catalytic systems, for example) the 
necessary [MRxl : [M'Xn] ratios are of the order of3-5 [120,133, 141] or even 20-50 
[120, 139, 158] whereas in the case of coarse IX-TiCl 3 samples where this interaction 
is minimal the ratio can be as low as 0.3 [114]. Judging by the data presented in 
Ref. [87] this ratio can, in principle, be decreased further to 0.05-0.1, i.e., to the value 
approaching the number of active centers on the catalyst surface (see Section II-6). 
Kinetic data [87] (see Figure II-22) show that the complete removal of 
organoaluminum compounds from the catalyst surface by a conventional washing 
technique is hardly attainable and would result in such an unstable catalyst that the 
estimation of its initial activity would become very dubious. If organometallic 
compounds indeed participate in the structure of active centers through their 
adsorption (as described by Eqn. II-ll or 11-12) the adsorption equilibrium con-
stants should be very high and the coverage of active centers with organometallic 
compounds can be regarded as virtually complete at any real concentration of 
organometallic compounds. For example, a rough estimation of the adsorption 
constant from the data on the initial catalyst activity presented in Fig. 11-12 gives 
K ~ 1 X 103 liter/mol. The only apparent exception to this rule is ZnEt2. The 
catalytic system IX-TiCI 3-ZnEt2 is characterized by a very low activity for propylene 
polymerization, 100 times lower than that of the IX-TiCI3-AlEt3 system with the 
same IX-TiCI 3 sample [140, 155]. This activity substantially depends on the ZnEt2 
concentration even at its highest levels, up to 0.4 mol/liter. The adsorption constant 
for this compound is of the order of3-4Iiter/mol at 70Â°C (based on the kinetic data 
[140]) and it strongly depends on temperature. More definite data about the 
participation of organometallic compounds in the functioning of polymerization 
centers can be found in papers examining the effects of mixtures of different 
organometallic compounds (see next section). 
Finally the data presented in Fig. 11-19 can be discussed. According to these data, 
a significant increase of the organometallic compound concentration results in a 
gradual decrease of catalytic activity. As was discussed earlier (Section II -4-b) it is 
necessary to distinguish two sources of this catalyst deactivation. The first source is 
the irreversible destruction of active centers by the excess of an organometallic 
compound, for example, in reduction reactions. This effect depends on the aging 
time of a catalytic system prior to monomer admittance and on the total duration 
of a polymerization experiment as well as on the organometallic compound con-
centration. It is especially pronounced when highly active, finely ground TiCl3 is 
used for catalyst preparation [120]; see Fig. 11-24. Such deactivation at high MRx 
concentrations is also typical for the VCI3 - MRx systems. For example, an excess of 
Ali-Bu3 readily destroys the active centers of this system (see Fig. II-IS). 
The second phenomenon related to Fig. 11-19 is the reversible deactivation of 
heterogeneous catalytic systems at high MRx concentrations [124, 143, 146, 159] 
(see Fig. 11-25). Two different explanations were presented for this phenomenon: 
(i) Following Refs. [143] and [146] the decrease of the polymerization rate can be 
described within the framework of a polymerization scheme according to which 
the polymerization step is the reaction involving two adsorbed molecules, a

monomer and an organometallic compound. Corresponding adsorption con-
stants at 50Â°C are 0.163 and 2.12 liter/mol. When the AlEt3 concentration is 
very high, it interferes with olefin adsorption and the polymerization rate 
declines. This approach was questioned in Ref. [20]. The discussion of the values 
of adsorption equilibrium constants for MRx presented in this section makes 
this assumption even less plausible. 
(ii) Following Refs. [124] and [159] organometallic compounds can be adsorbed on 
polymerization centers (monometallic according to the hypothesis in Refs. 
[124] and [159]) and temporarily deactivate them. 
It can be seen from Fig. 11-25 that this equilibrium deactivation of the catalyst 
occurs only at very high AlEt3 concentrations (ca. 0.5-1 mol/liter) and it can be 
neglected when polymerization experiments are carried out with standard (ca. 0.01 
mol/liter) concentrations.

II-4: Organometallic Compounds and Catalyst Activity 
II-4-e. 
Polymerization with Various Organometallic Compounds and 
Their Mixtures 
139 
Numerous studies showed that the activity of the same transition metal halide when 
used in combination with different organometallic compounds varies over a very 
wide range. Relative activities of different organometallic compounds are presented 
in Table II-4 in which the activity of AIEt3 is defined as 100. It is important to note 
that the activities of different TiCl3 samples used with the same organometallic 
compounds also vary substantially, e.g., the b-TiC13-AlEt3 system is approximately 
10 times more active than the system containing coarse ct-TiCl3 and AlEt3. Hence 
the activity order presented in Table II-4 is only to a first approximation indepen-
dent of the type of solid catalyst. 
Taking into account the data on kinetic aspects of the interaction between 
transition metal halides and organometallic compounds (Section II-2) and the lack 
of any unified procedure for the estimation of reactivity9 the data presented in Table 
II-4 can be restated in a more qualitative manner: 
BeEt2 (~250) > AlR3 (100-130; R = Et, Pr, i-Bu, n-C1oH21 , etc.) > AIR2X 
(5-12; R = Et, i-Bu; X = CI, Br, I) > ZnEt2 ( ~ 1) > AlEtCl2 (0). 
Similar data for VCl3-based systems are available for only a few organometallic 
compounds. Activities of trialkyla1uminum products in 4-methyl-I-pentene poly-
merization at 30Â°C vary according to the ratios: AlEt3 : Ali-Bu3 : Aln-Bu3 : Aln-
Dec3 = 100: 112: 68 : 29 [171]. The principal question is; what is the reason for 
these differences? Are they due to differences in kp for various organometallic 
compounds or due to differences in concentrations of active centers in the catalysts, 
or both? 
As was discussed in Sections 1-3 and 1-5, the precision of the experimental 
methods for the kp and Co measurements are insufficient for an unambiguous 
answer. Different authors have different opinions: some propose that this pheno-
menon is primarily due to differences in kp, the Co values being roughly the same 
[160]; others state that the effects are mainly due to differences in Co [124,134, 152, 
159], or that both sources contribute to the overall effect [154, 156]. This problem 
has one important mechanistic implication: if kp for all these catalysts are the same 
independently of the type of organometallic compound, the probability is high that 
the polymerization centers do not include these compounds in their structure, i.e., 
they are monometallic, whereas the dependence of kp on the structure of orga-
nometallic compounds suggests their direct participation in the center structure. 
Experiments which can answer the question are those performed with mixtures 
of different organometallic compounds or those which involve substitution of 
organometallic compounds in the course of a single polymerization run. 
The experiments using mixtures of organometallic compounds were performed 
9 For example, the data for ex-TiC1 3 in Table II-4 correspond mainly to stationary polymerization rates 
[135, 136, 160, 161] or average rates [162], whereas the data for b-TiC13 are mainly based on polymer 
yields for some definite polymerization duration (usually 45 or 60 min) [141] or on maximum rates [152].

AlEt3-ZnEtz (with (X-TiCl3 [163]), 
AlEt3-AlEtzCl (with J-TiCI3 [141, 172] and y-TiC13 [168]), 
AlEt3-AlEtClz (with J-TiCI3 [141, 172] and /3-TiCI3 [87, 88]), 
AlEt3-AlzEt3Cl3 (with J-TiCl3 [141,172]), 
AlEt3-AlEtz OH (the first product of AlEt3 hydrolysis, with (X-TiCl3 [173, 174]),

AlEtzCl-AlEtClz (with J-TiCI3 [128, 134], p-TiCl3 [87], and y-TiC13 [168]). 
Good reversibility is characteristic for most of these experiments (see, for example, 
Fig. 11-26), i.e., the observed effects usually can be regarded as equilibrium ones. 
Before discussing these data it should be noted that AlEtClz and AlzEt3Cl3 under 
conditions typical for olefin polymerization rapidly react with AIEt3 causing

AlEtzCI formation [176, 177] and mixtures such as AlEt3-AlEtClz or AlEt3-
AlzEt3Cl3 are in effect mixtures of AlEt3 and AlEtzCI if AlEt3 is in excess. 
One of the simplest examples of the effect of organometallic compound mixtures 
on catalyst activity was found for the AlEt3-ZnEtz pair (with (X-TiCI3 at 50Â°C) 
[163]; see Fig. II-27. Addition of ZnEtz to the reaction system results in a gradual 
decrease of kerr measured in a stationary stage after 60-90 min of reaction. However 
the kerr limit for the (X-TiCI3-AlEt3-ZnEtz system ( ~ 1.2 x 1O-31iter/minÂ· g TiCI3) 
is significantly higher than that for the pure (X-TiCI3-ZnEt3 system: 3.45 x 10-5 
liter/minÂ· g TiCl3 at 50Â°C for the same (X-TiCI3 sample [140]. 
Two main conclusions can be made: 
(i) ZnEt3 is an inadequate co-catalyst for (X-TiC13 as far as active center formation 
is concerned even at high concentration. When used with the centers formed in 
the IX-TiCI3-AlEt3 system it is a potent co-catalyst-it is only ca. 3 times less 
active than AlEt3 compared with the ca. 100 fold difference between pure AlEt3 
and ZnEtz. 
(ii) As soon as the concentrations of ZnEtz (up to 1 mol/liter) and AlEt3 (0.36 
mol/liter) in the experiments presented in Fig. II-27 become very high and far 
exceed the concentrations sufficient for the formation and full coverage of all

polymerization centers, even in the most conservative estimations (see Section 
II-4-d), a straightforward way to explain the data is by assuming the following 
equilibrium complexation process 
(II-14) 
where (MRx)l and (MRx)2 are the two organometallic compounds involved 
(here AlEt3 and ZnEt2) which are present both in solution (superscript sol) and 
adsorbed on active centers (superscript ads) so that the sum of both amounts 
Center . (MRx)~ds + Center . (MRx)~ds = Cp and K is the equilibrium constant. 
If both active species present in the system, Center' (MRx)1dS 
and 
Center . (MRJ~d., are characterized by different propagation rate constants, k'p and 
k;, and if the sorption capacity of a solid catalyst component is low (i.e., if the 
concentration decrease of both organometallic compounds in solution due to their 
adsorption can be neglected) the expression for the effective polymerization con-
stant is 
(II-IS) 
where GCat is the weight of the catalyst. 
This equation is based on the simplified version of a standard Langmuir equation 
for the adsorption of two substances on a surface. Its linear form can be obtained by 
taking into account that the expression for the polymerization rate constant in the 
presence of any pure organometallic compound is keff = RjCmGcat = kpCp 
(II-I 6) 
where k'eff is measured with (MRx) 1 and k~ff is measured with (MRxh. This equation 
is valid only if Cp is the same for polymerization with both pure organometallic 
compounds and with their mixtures i.e., if a polymerization system responds to a 
change ofMRx as shown in Figure II-26. 
An important particular case ofEqn. II-IS is when k; = 0, i.e., when the complex 
[Center' (MRxhl is inactive in olefin polymerization. Then

(II-l 8) 
The data presented in Fig. II-27 for the ex-TiC13-AlEt3-ZnEtz system can be 
treated by application ofEqn. II-16 and they give K ~ 5.2, i.e., ZnEt2 has a 5.2 times 
stronger affinity for active centers than AlEt3 (these calculations were carried out 
without consideration of a possible dissociation of the organometallic compounds 
in the adsorbed state). Data for the b-TiC13-Ali-Bu3-Ali-BuzH system [172] can be 
treated similarly and give K ~ 1 at 56Â°C. Another example of the equilibrium 
complexation system is b-TiCl3-AlEtzCl-AlEtzl (propylene polymerization in 
toluene medium at 70Â°C) [165]. Figure II-28 shows the dependence of catalyst 
activity on the [AlEtzCl] : [AlEt2I] ratio and the transformation of these data in the 
coordinates ofEqn. II-l6. Kfor this pair of organoaluminum compounds is ca. 5.5. 
A similar situation exists in the case of the TiCl3-AlEtzCl-AlEtClz catalytic 
systems. Published experimental data for these systems are collected in Fig. II-29 
(from Refs. [128, 134, 141, 165, 168], temperature range 40-60Â°C). 
Equations II-17 and II-18 can be applied for the treatment of these data because 
AlEtClz is not active as a co-catalyst: see Table II-4. Figure II-30 shows the 
experimental data of Fig. II-29 in the coordinates of Eqn. II-17. The apparent value 
for K in this system is in the 4-8 range. 
It should be noted that the treatment of experimental data for binary co-catalyst systems 
as done in Figs. II-27, II-28, and 11-30 represents only a first-order approximation approach.

Most organometallic compounds are associated in solution and mixed associates are easily 
formed in their binary systems. For example, the equilibrium 
(II-19) 
exists in AIR2CI-AIR2Br mixtures with the equilibrium constant for R = Me being in the 
1-3 range [177, 178], i.e., halogen distribution among these three dimers is close to random. 
Moreover, all these three products are in equilibrium with monomeric compounds, AIR2CI 
and AIR2Br, which are present in solution in very low concentration. Similarly, the 
equilibrium 
(II-20) 
exists in AIRCI2-AIR2CI mixtures with equilibrium constants in the range of 5.5 (for R 
= Me)10 to 0.8 (for R = Et) [179], all components of which are by themselves in equilibrium 
with monomeric AIR2CI and AIRCI2. 
lOThe equilibrium constant for R = Me in toluene at -40Â°C is 77 [180].

Attempts were made to take these equilibria into account and to examine the effects of 
particular associates or particular monomeric forms of organoaluminum compounds on 
catalytic activity in terms of Reaction II-I4 and Eqn. 11-16 or 11-18. However, the best linear 
fits were found when total organoaluminum compound concentrations were considered (as 
shown in Figs. II-27, II-28, and II-30) rather than concentrations of associates or monomeric 
compounds. Two reasons can account for this: (a) high lability of these dimersll and (b) a 
more complex process of interaction between the potential active centers and the organome-
tallic compounds than that represented by the simple redistribution reaction II-I4. 
Another case when the substitution reaction scheme II-14 can be readily applied 
is the mixture of AlEt3 and AlEt20H in the presence of 0(-TiCI3. A study on the 
effect of water on propylene polymerization with the 0(-TiCI3-AIEt3 system at 70Â°C 
revealed (see details in Section II-5-a) that the interaction between AIEt3 and water 
proceeds in two steps [174,181]:

(II-22) 
11 Dimerization not only through halogen atom bridges but also through alkyl group bridges is possible 
in these compounds [177, 179].

II: Chemistry and Functioning of Heterogeneous Catalysts 
In hydrocarbon media (heptane, propane-propylene mixtures) and at very low 
water concentration, 1-5 x 10-5 mol/liter, this reaction is not especially vigorous 
and the two reaction stages, Reactions 11-21 and II-22, are separated in time. The 
bimolecular rate constant for Reaction 11-22 is ca. 25 times lower than that for 
Reaction 11-21 [174].12 Usually addition of water to the 0:-TiCI3-AlEt3 system 
results in significant induction periods in olefin polymerization (see Section 11-5-a). 
However, when AlEt3 and H20 solutions in heptane are aged for some time prior to 
the 0:-TiCl3 admission, i.e., when Reaction 11-21 is practically completed [173, 174] 
(usually after, 1-1.5 h at 70Â°C), no induction periods were found. Propylene 
polymerization in these cases exhibits a stationary kinetic behavior but with rates 
always lower than in absence of water because AlEt20H is inactive as a catalytic 
center component (see Table 11-4) and replaces AlEt3 in Reaction 11-14. The 
application ofEqn. 11-18 to these data [174] showed that K for the AlEt3-AlEt2 OH 
pair in Reaction 11-14 is ca. 120, i.e., the inhibitor AlEt20H has 120 times stronger 
affinity for polymerization centers than the activator AlEt3. This estimation is 
related to dimeric forms of both compounds. The final product of the AlEt3-water 
interaction, aluminoxane (AlEt20AlEt2) (Reaction 11-22), does not interfere with 
olefin polymerization [174, 175]. 
A more complex situation was found in other studies of binary mixtures of 
organometallic compounds. The AlEt3-AlEt20Et system was tested in combina-
tion with 0:-TiC13 for propylene polymerization at 70Â°C [166]. AlEt20Et can be 
introduced in the system as such or it forms practically instantly if C2H 50H is 
added in a small amount to AlEt3 solution. Experimental results for these two cases 
coincide completely. Some typical kinetic polymerization curves are presented in 
Fig. 11-31. Polymerization with the AlEt20Et-AlEt3-0:-TiCI3 system has a very 
low initial rate, but it gradually accelerates and after ca. 40 min the catalytic system 
becomes stable and highly active. The conditions for propylene polymerization in 
these experiments (the stable 0:-TiCI3-AlEt3 system, 70Â°C, propane-propylene 
mixtures) were such that in the absence of AlEt20Et polymerization is very stable 
and exhibits no acceleration due to the initiation processes (Section I -2-b): see curve 
3 in Fig. 11-31. For this reason the existence oflong acceleration periods after the 
addition of AlEt20Et to this system was regarded as the manifestation of some 
specific interaction in the AlEt3 -AlEt2 OEt mixtures [166]. Pure AlEt20Et by itself 
is not an active co-catalyst for olefin polymerization (see Table 11-4) and judging by 
initial polymerization rates (Fig. 11-31) it effectively inhibits polymerization pro-
cesses in the presence of AlEt3. The value of K for the AlEt3-AlEt20Et pair 
calculated for the redistribution reaction 11-14 with Eqn. 11-18 (k~ = 0) is ca. 160. 
The subsequent acceleration of the polymerization reaction was attributed to the 
reaction 
(II-23) 
12 Direct experimental data for a similar ZnEt2-H 20 interaction confirm that, under mild conditions, 
the reaction is not fast: at 200e and with 0.02 mol/liter ZnEt2 in benzene the formation of ZnEtOH in a 
I : I component mixture takes ca. 30 min to complete (k20,c = 0.33 liter/molÂ· s) [182].

system at 70Â°C [166]. CTiC13 = 1.6-2.1 mmol/liter. Concentrations of AIEt3 and AIEt20Et 
(mmol/liter): (I) 3.6, 1.3; (2) 5.0, 5.0; (3) 8.7, 0; (4) 4.7,1.1. 
It is known [176-178] that dia1kylaluminum alkoxides are strongly associated in 
solution and and that their reaction with other organoaluminum compounds with 
the formation ofhemi-alkoxides (as in Reaction II-23) is very slow even at increased 
temperatures. It was suggested [166] that the hemi-alkoxide is an active co-catalyst 
for olefin polymerization. When the data for the activity ofthe AlEt3-AlEt20Et-a-
TiCl3 system after the completion of the acceleration period (see Fig. II-31) were 
plotted vs. the [AlEt20Et]: [AlEt3] ratio in Fig. II-32 it became evident that the 
hemi-alkoxide formed in Reaction II-23 is more active than pure AlEt3 [166, 168]. 
The activity increase is ca. 50% and persists up to a [AlEt20Et] : [AlEt3] ratio of 1, 
i.e., in the system (AIEt3)z-Et2AIEtÂ· EtOAlEt2 the second compound not only is 
more active as a co-catalyst but easily replaces (AlEt3)2 in active centers in Reaction 
II-14. 
A similar situation was found in the AIEt3-AIEt20i-Pr-b-TiCI3 system (propylene 
polymerization at 70Â°C) where the hemi-alkoxide is ca. 50% more active than AIEt3 itself 
[166]. When the [AIEt20Et] : [AIEt3] ratio exceeds I the competition in Reaction II-13 is 
between an active co-catalyst Et2AIEtÂ· EtOAIEt2 and inactive (AIEt2 0Et)2 (see Fig. II-32). 
The K value for this pair, calculated with Eqn. II-17, is 1.8, i.e., the adsorption power of the 
inactive dimer is a little higher than that of the hemi-alkoxide. These data represent the most 
direct evidence up to now in favor of the assumption that organometallic associates partici-
pate in the equilibrium of Reaction II-14 rather than their monomeric forms. It is evident 
from Fig. II-31 that Reaction II-23 is not especially rapid either in solution (5.2Iiter/molÂ· min 
at 70Â°C, [166]) or on the IX-TiCI3 surface. The acceleration stage c;an be eliminated virtually 
completely if dimers of AIEt3 and AIEt20Et interact in solution for a sufficient time in the 
absence of TiCI3 (Fig. II-31).

Data on other AlEt3-AIEtzOR-IX-TiCI3 (R = Me, n-Bu, n-Hex) systems are not as easily 
explainable as those for R = Et [166, 183]. Not only does the activity reported for these 
tertiary systems differ in different papers (activation ca. 50% for all R in Ref. [166], but ca. 
20% deactivation for R = n-Bu in Refs. [138] and [183]) but the [AlEtzOR]: [AlEt3] range 
for nearly constant activity of the systems exceeds 1 as is typical for the AIEt3-AIEtz OEt pair 
(Fig. II-32) and reaches 1.5-2. Ethylalkoxyaluminum chlorides AIEt(OR)CI (R = Et, i-Pr) 
are very poor co-catalysts for olefin polymerization [166, 170] (see Table 11-4). However, this 
is true only in the case ofTiCl3 samples that are free from AlCI3. It was shown [170] that the 
AlEt(OEt)CI-b-TiCI3 system containing AlCl3 exhibits substantial activity in propylene 
polymerization, comparable to that of the AlEtzCI-b-TiCI3 system. This effect was at-
tributed to AlEtzCl formation by a disproportionation reaction between AlEt(OEt)Cl and 
AICI3. This phenomenon probably partIy accounts for different effects in the ternary 
AlEtzCl-AlEt(OR)CI-TiCI3 systems (R = Et, i-Pr) for propylene polymerization [166, 
184]. AlEt (OR) Cl in these systems was generated in situ by the reaction between AlEtz CI and 
ROH [185]. It was found [166] that an increase in the [AlEt(Oi-Pr)CI] : [AlEtzCl] ratio in the 
AlEt2CI-AlEt(Oi-Pr)CI-TiCl3 systems results in a monotonous activity decrease for propyl-
ene polymerization at 70Â°C both in the case of IX-TiCI3 and b-TiC13 containing AICI3. The 
decrease is similar to that found for the AlEtz CI-AlEtCI2- TiCl3 systems (Fig. 11-29) and can 
be described by equilibrium reaction 11-14 with K ~ 6. On the other hand, the data presented 
in Ref. [184] demonstrate that the AIEtzCI-AIEt(OEt)CI-b-TiCI3 catalytic system exhibits 
enhanced yields in propylene polymerization at 75Â°C compared to the AlEt2CI-b-TiCI3

system up to an atomic O/AI ratio ~ 1, i.e., the pure AlEt (OEt) CI-TiCl3 system. Apparently 
a more detailed kinetic study of the catalytic system is necessary to elucidate this controversy. 
The last mixed catalytic system to be discussed is AlEt3-AlEt2 CI-TiCI3. Most 
kinetic experimental data published in the literature on this system are plotted in 
Figs. II-33 and II-34 in coordinates of relative reactivity versus [AlEt2CI] : [AlEt3] 
ratio. They encompass data on ethylene and propylene polymerization with 6- and 
[3-TiCl3 samples in the 30-60Â°C range [87, 141, 172]. In some cases the initially used 
organoaluminum compounds were AlEt3 and AlEtCl2 which rapidly form AlEt2 Cl 
in solution under these conditions. Qualitatively the dependence is the same as that 
for the AlEt3-AlEt20Et system: catalyst activity remains approximately constant 
up to a certain [AlEt2Cl] : [AlEt3] ratio and then gradually decreases to the level 
typical for the AlEt2 CI-TiCl3 system (marked in the figures). An unusual feature of 
these data is that the rate decrease starts not from the I : 1 ratio as in Fig. II-32 but 
from [AlEt2CI] : [AlEt3] ratios of 1.5-2 or higher. A similar situation was found for 
the [3-TiCI3-Ali-Bu3-Ali-Bu2CI system (ethylene polymerization at 60Â°C and 
monomer pressure of I atm) [167]: the increase of the [Ali-Bu2CI]: [Ali-Bu3] ratio 
up to 2 resulted in a catalytic activity decrease of only 12.5%, whereas the Ali-

mers do not provide a quantitative explanation for the experimental data presented 
in Fig. 11-33 and 11-34. Apparently existence of a more complex equilibrium than 
that in Reaction II-14 should be considered for the AlEt3-AlEt2CI system. 
In spite of this uncertainty some definite conclusions can be made from the 
analysis of the data presented in this section. In general, the variation ofheteroge-
neous catalyst activity with the type of organometallic compound (Table 11-4) can 
be explained as the overlap of two effects: (a) differences in kp for the centers 
containing different organometallic compounds and (b) difference in the number of 
these centers. In such systems as ZnEt2- TiCl3 the main reason for the poor catalyst 
performance is the small amount of active centers rather than the difference 

I1-5: Effects of Catalyst Poisons and Modifiers 
153 
in k p â¢ On the other hand, in many cases the principal reason for the activity 
variation is the variation in k p â¢ For such systems catalytic activity of tertiary 
(MRxh -(MRxh-TiCl3 systems at high and low [(MRx)l] : [(MRx)2] ratios is close 
to the activity of the (MRx)l-TiCl3 and (MRxh-TiCl3 systems, even when the 
conditions for the formation of potentially active centers are adequate (for example, 
even when the tertiary systems are examined at constant [AlEt3] : [TiCI3] ratios as 
for some of the data in Figs. II-33 and II-34). 
The principal mechanistic implication of these data is that organometallic com-
pounds do participate in the structure of active centers at least as far as their 
reactivity is concerned. In many cases this participation in the active center structure 
is reversible and can be described, to a first approximation, as an equilibrium 
adsorption with a very high adsorption constant. The value of this constant appa-
rently cannot be measured by varying the [MRxl : [TiCI3] ratio (as is discussed in 
Sections II-4-a-II-4-e) but the existence of this equilibrium adsorption is clearly 
manifested by the data for organometallic compound mixtures. Experimental data 
for some binary mixtures of organometallic compounds hint that organoaluminum 
compounds are adsorbed on active centers in the form of associates (usually dimers) 
rather than as monomeric forms. 
11-5. 
Effects of Catalyst Poisons and Modifiers. The Measurement 
of Active Center Concentration 
All heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts are very sensitive to the overwhelming 
majority of organic and inorganic substances. Examples of real catalytic promotion 
are very rare (some amines) and most chemical substances reduce catalytic activity 
drastically or halt in completely, i.e., they can be regarded as classical catalytic 
poisons. The significance of the study of catalyst poisoning in the case of 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts is twofold. First, it helps in the understanding of some 
important features of the catalytic polymerization mechanism (as poison studies 
usually do) and it helps to reveal the role of co-catalysts (organometallic com-
pounds) in the polymerization reactions. Second, catalyst poisons are widely used 
for the quantitative estimation of active center concentrations in these catalysts by 
various direct or indirect procedures. It seems pertinent to discuss both these 
applications in parallel. 
Generally speaking, any effect of a catalytic poison in the case of Ziegler-Natta 
catalysts can be classified as one of three different effects: 
(i) Interaction with an organometallic compound usually results in the formation 
of a new organometallic compound which effects catalytic activity through 
competition with the initial organometallic compound. Many examples of such 
competition were presented in the previous section. 
(ii) Interaction with a solid catalyst component usually results in the formation of 
new derivatives of the transition metal and (after interaction with an orga-
nometallic compound) in the formation of a new catalyst.

data are from Ref. [127]. 
(iii) Interaction of a poison with polymerization centers usually deactivates the 
centers either reversibly or irreversibly. 
Careful selection of polymerization conditions gives one the possibility to separate 
these effects in many cases. 
II-S-a. Water 
Water is the most typical poisonous impurity in Ziegler-Natta catalyst studies. 
Whereas its addition to a polymerization system in a significant amount invariably 
brings the polymerization process to a complete halt due to the complete destruc-
tion of all catalyst ingredients, studies on the effects of very low water con-
centrations revealed more complex and diversified phenomena [127, 173, 174]. The 
three effects discussed above were separated by the aging technique, i.e., by the 
preliminary interaction of water with one of the catalyst components. 
Interaction of MRx with Water. 
As was mentioned earlier (Section II-4-e) this 
interaction is not very fast in hydrocarbon solution. For this reason, the kinetics of 
olefin polymerization in the presence of minor amounts of water is characterized by 
significant induction periods followed by acceleration periods (see Fig. II-35) [173, 
183]. It was suggested [173] that H 20, when added to the AlEt3-cx-TiCl3 catalytic 

iI-5: Effects of Catalyst Poisons and Modifiers 
155 
system, is strongly but reversibly adsorbed on the TiCl3 surface and that formation 
(or activation) of polymerization centers is prevented until all free water is removed 
from the system. The interaction between H 20 and AlEt3 (presumably Reaction 
11-21) proceeds both in solution (with the rate constant k 2 ) and on the TiCl3 surface 
completely covered by water molecules (k1), i.e., 
(11-25) 
If one assumes that the induction period (rind) in olefin polymerization in the 
presence of water (see definition in Fig. 11-35) roughly corresponds to the moment 
when all water has reacted with AlEt3, i.e., at t = Lind CH20 = 0, then the expression 
for the induction period as a function of reaction conditions is [173]: 
The values of reaction constants at 70Â°C are [127, 173]: 
k1So = (2.0-2.3) x 1O-4 Iiter/gÂ·min 
(for 0(-TiC13 with So = 7 m2/g, kl ~ 2.8 x 1O-6 liter/minÂ· m 2 ) 
k2 = 4.0-4.3 liter/molÂ· min 
(11-26) 
Equation 11-26 with these parameters correlates well with the experimentally 
measured induction periods for the 0(-TiC13-AlEt3 system [173]. 
When AlEt3 and H 20 are allowed to interact in the absence of TiCI3, the 
subsequent induction periods can be substantially shortened and, if this interaction 
is long enough, they can be avoided completely. Detailed experiments with different 
aging periods showed that the AlEt3-H20 interaction proceeds in two stages, 
Reactions 11-21 and 11-22. The first product of this reaction, AlEt20H [174,181], is 
an effective inhibitor of polymerization centers and competes with the remaining 
AIEt3 (Section 11-4-e) for the centers. The second reaction product, aluminoxane 
Et2AIOAlEt2 , has no influence on the activity of the center. For this reason, the 
catalyst activity in a stationary state (see Fig. 11-35), i.e., after the completetion of 
the induction and acceleration periods, is lower than in blank experiments but, if 
AlEt3 and H 20 are allowed to interact in the absence ofTiCl3 for a long time (30-40 
h), the subsequent activity is the same as in blank runs. 
Interaction of Water with TiCl3 and Active Centers. 
Unexpected data were obtained 
in experiments when water was allowed to interact with TiCl3 in the absence of AlEt3 for 
different periods of time and when propylene polymerization kinetics were measured after 
the subsequent addition of AlEt3 to the system (see Table 11-5). A comparison of the data 
for runs 2, 3, and 4 in Table 11-5 indicates that the duration of the TiCI3-H20 interaction 
virtually does not influence the kinetic characteristics of the subsequent propylene polymeri-
zation with this catalyst. This means that the TiCI3-H20 interaction, if exists at all, is very 
fast and the subsequent aging does not change the solid component. 13 A comparison of this 
13This could not be the case for TiCI3 samples containing AICI3.

catalyst's activity with that of a catalyst in a control run (run 1 in Table 11-5) shows that, after 
interaction with water, TiCl3 increased its activity ca. 1.5 times. More detailed data on the 
TiCI3-H20 interaction are presented in Fig. 11-36 (curve I) where kerr values measured in the 
stationary polymerization stage (see Fig. 11-35) are plotted vs. the CH,O/CTiCl3 ratio. The 
curve has a complex shape and exhibits both a minimum and a maximum. It should be 
remembered that the data on the catalyst activity are obscured by the competition between 
AIEt3 and AlEt20H for polymerization centers as described in Section 11-4-e. This compe-
tition can be taken into account quantitatively by the application of Eqn. 11-18, i.e., by the 
calculation of k'.ff' the effective polymerization rate constant in the presence of pure AlEt3 as 
a co-catalyst. These values are also presented in Fig. 11-36 (curve 2). 
If AlEt20H did not compete with AIEts for the polymerization centers the activity of the 
catalyst after the TiCI3-H20 interaction would increase approximately threefold. To prove 
this conclusion, two polymerization experiments were performed (runs 5 and 6 in Table 11-5) 
where after the completion of the induction period (precalculated with Eqn. 11-26) an 
additional amount of AIEt3 was added to the system to decrease the [AIEt20H1: [AlEt31 
ratio.14 It can be seen from Table 11-5 that keff indeed improved significantly and in both 
cases exceeded that for a blank run. These data, after recalculation for a new 
[AlEt20H] : [AIEt31 ratio, fit well with curve 2 in Fig. 11-36. 
The data presented in Fig. 11-36 correspond to the following relation between the amount 
of H20 and the TiCl3 surface area: 
The beginning of the keff increase in curve 2: at ~ 1.5 x 10-3 g H20/g TiCI3 ~ 0.07 H20

These calculations are made for So = 7 m2/g and with the application ofthe TiCl3 lattice

centration variation by itself.

parameters presented in Section II-I-a. They show that the interaction between TiCl3 and 
H20 results in a rapid modification of the TiCl3 surface (probably due to H20 adsorption) 
and, after the subsequent addition of AlEt3 and the complete removal of H20 from the 
surface during the induction period, new catalytic centers emerge with increased activity. The 
alternative explanation ofthe effect of water on TiCl3 as seen in Fig. II-36 is the etching of the 
TiCl3 surface by water and the increase of the specific surface area of the resulting catalyst. 
When a small amount of water is added to a G(-TiC13-AlEt2Cl system at 70Â°C, its activity 
also can be increased ca. 1.5 times. However the further addition of water up to a 40 ppm 
concentration deactivates the catalyst completely [187]. On the other hand, the treatment of 
6-TiC13 containing AICl3 with water invariably deactivates this solid as a polymerization 
catalyst [153]. 
Effects of Water and the Concentration of Active Centers. 
Two stages of the 
polymerization process in the presence of water were discussed earlier in this 
section-induction periods and stationary polymerization reactions. They are sep-
arated by the acceleration period which, according to Ref. [127], corresponds to the 
situation when the polymerization solution is free from water and the water-AlEt3 
interaction is being completed on the TiCl3 surface. During this stage, some portion

where CfI20 is the water concentration on the TiCl3 surface and (CfI20) corresponds 
to complete coverage. A part of the surface (1 -
I1H20) is free from water and 
contains active centers for polymerizing olefins. By combining Eqn. II-25 for water 
consumption and Eqn. II-18 for the competitive adsorption of AlEt3 (active co-
catalyst) and AlEt20H (inactive co-catalyst), the following expression was obtained 
for the acceleration period of olefin polymerization [127] 
(II-27) 
where k~ is the elementary constant for the AlEt3-H20 interaction on the catalyst 
surface, SH20 (m2/mol) is the area occupied by one mole of water on the surface, 
k~SH20 = kl (see Eqn. II-25), and CAlEt3 ~ CXlEt3 -
C~20. 
Figure II-37 presents experimental data for kerr as a function of time and two 
curves calculated with Eqn. II-27 for two values of SH20. One of them corresponds 
to the ca. 13 }..2 area of one water molecule estimated in experiments on water 
adsorption [188], i.e., to SH20 = 7.84 X 104 m2/mol (curve 2). This curve evidently 
does not fit the experimental data. Curve 1 in Fig. II-37 was calculated by a simple

adjustment method and corresponds to SH20 = 2.12 X 105 m2/mol, i.e., 35 A2 per 
one water molecule. 
Two alternative explanations can be given for this correlation [127]: 
(i) One water molecule covers an unusually large area on the TiCl3 surface and 
prevents the formation of active centers. 
(ii) During active center formation on the TiCl3 surface in the reaction between 
TiCl3 and AlEt3, water molecules migrate to these centers, coordinate with 
them (one molecule per center), and prevent olefin polymerization. 
The second explanation seems more plausible: the complexes which can be 
formed in the reaction of water with transition metal atoms in proposed active 
centers (see Chapter V) should be more stable than the complexes of water with 
halogen atoms covering the virgin TiCl3 surface. If the second explanation is 
correct, the concentration of active centers on the catalyst surface in these experi-
mentsisoftheorderof3 x 1018 centers/m2 0rca. 5 x 1O-6 mol/m2. 
TI-5-b. 
Alcohols 
Alcohols are widely used for the termination of olefin polymerization reactions. 
Tritium-labeled alcohols are frequently used as radioactive stoppers for the quanti-
tative estimation of the active center concentrations in heterogeneous Ziegler-
Natta catalysts. As was found in the case of water (see the previous section) three 
different effects can be separated in aging experiments: interaction of alcohols with 
organometallic compounds, interaction of alcohols with transition metal halides, 
and reaction of alcohols with polymerization centers. 
Interaction of Alcohols with Organometallic Compounds. 
This reaction in a hydro-
carbon medium is very fast and results in alkoxide formation [177, 185]: 
(II-28) 
The rate constants for the reaction of methanol, ethanol, and isobutanol with AlEt3 
at 20Â°C in heptane solution are ca. 2 x 103-2 x 104 liter/molÂ· s. 
Alkoxides AlEt20R form stable dimers (or trimers for R = Me) which virtually 
do not dissociate in hydrocarbon solution. As was discussed in Section II-4-e, these 
dime ric alkoxides inhibit olefin polymerization with heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta 
catalysts due to their competitive (with AlEt3) adsorption on the active centers. 
When mixtures of (AlEt3h and (AlEt20R)2 contain an excess of AlEt3 they slowly 
rearrange to hemi-alkoxides AlEt3 . AlEt20R (Reaction II_23),15 which are effec-
tive co-catalysts of olefin polymerization [166]. 
15 This reaction can be followed, for example, by electroconductivity measurements. It is virtually absent 
in the case of R = i-Pr [166].

When alcohols are adsorbed on TiCl3 surfaces, Reaction 11-23 proceeds signifi-
cantly slower than in solution. For this reason when the order of component mixing 
in the TiCl3-AlEt3-ROH systems is (TiCl3 + ROH) + AlEt3, polymerization 
curves exhibit pronounced induction periods corresponding to the interaction of 
adsorbed alcohols with AlEt3 and the subsequent acceleration stage (Reaction 11-
23) followed by stationary polymerization (see curve 6 in Fig. 11-38). These induc-
tion periods do not depend on the total alcohol concentration in the system because 
the alcohol remaining in solution reacts with AlEt3 very rapidly and only adsorbed 
alcohol molecules react slowly. The total duration of the induction and acceleration 
stages is 35-45 min for IX-TiCl3 with So = 7 m 2jg. 
If alcohol has a bulky alkyl group (e.g., phenyldimethylcarbinol), the alkoxide 
formed in its interaction with AlEt3 (Reaction 11-38) exhibits, in the presence of 
excess of AlEt3, a significant modifying effect on the the supported TiCl4 jMgCl2 
catalyst [214]. This effect is discussed in Section IV-l-b and is shown in Fig. IV-12. 
The modifying behavior of such alcohols is qualitatively similar to that of aromatic 
acid esters (see Section 11-5-e). 
Interaction of Alcohols with TiCl3. When IX-TiCI3 is brought into contact with an 
alcohol solution and is allowed to react for 1-120 min before AlEt3 is added, the polymeri-
zation rate in the stationary stage, i.e., after the completion of the induction and acceleration 
stages, is always lower than in thc case when the mixing order is (AlEt3 + ROH) + TiCI3. It 
was suggested that alcohols slowly interact with the TiCI3 surface, possibly according to the 
substitution reaction

which results in eventual catalyst deterioration. The degree of this deterioration depends on 
the type of alcohol: it is small for methanol and isopropanol and more significant for ethanol, 
butanol, and hexano1 (see Table 11-6). 
When the Â£5-TiCI3-AlEt3 system is used for propylene polymerization at 70Â°C the prelimi-
nary interaction of Â£5-TiCI3 with isopropanol sharply reduces the catalytic activity: kerr 
decreases from 173 liter/min . gTiCl3 in a control run to 5-9 liter/min . g TiCI3, whereas when 
isopropanol interacts with AlEt3 first, the subsequent catalytic activity increases: kerr rises to 
250-270 liter/min' g TiCI3. 
Interaction of Alcohols with Polymerization Centers. 
Alcohols are generally used 
for the interruption of olefin polymerization reactions with Ziegler-N atta catalysts, 
both in industrial and laboratory practice, i.e., they are effective destroyers of 
polymerization centers. According to general belief, the reaction involved is similar 
to that between organometallic compounds and alcohols (Reaction II-28): 
Cat-Polymer + ROH ~ Cat-OR + Polymer-H 
(II-29) 
A prerequisite for completion of the reaction is total (or nearly total) destruction 
of all organometallic compounds present in the polymerization medium due to a 
very high rate of Reactions II-28 in solution. If this condition is not met (for 
example, if the amount of ROH added to the system is small) the polymerization 
reaction is inhibited only temporarily [161, 190] (see Fig. II-38) and it restarts 
spontaneously after a short induction period. 
Different explanations can account for these deactivation and activity restora-
tion processes. The first one is the destruction of polymerization centers and their 
subsequent regeneration as the result of the action of free AlEt3 remaining in the 
system [161, 190]. The second explanation is temporary reversible deactivation of 
polymerization centers by (AlEtzOR)z (rapidly formed in solution) and the sub-
sequent activation of the centers by hemi-alkoxides (Reaction II-23). 
Reaction II-29 results in the formation of polymer chains with saturated end-
groups bearing hydrogen atoms that previously belonged to the alcohol molecules. 
This conclusion was experimentally proved [191] by using tritium-labeled alcohols

for the termination of ethylene polymerization with the TiCIcAlEt3 system. It later 
was confirmed many times for polymerizations of ethylene, propylene, I-butene, 1-
hexene, and isoprene with catalytic systems containing a-TiCI3, ~-TiCI3, VCI3, and 
various supported catalysts [161,190,192-198]. In all cases a substantial part ofthe 
polymer molecules was labeled with tritium. This reaction represents an effective 
method of label introduction into polymer molecules connected to active centers 
and it is widely used for the estimation of polymerization center concentration. 
II-5-c. 
Measurement of Active Center Concentration Based on Alcohol 
Reactions 
Data presented in the previous section provide two methods for the measurement of 
active center concentration. The first method is based on the selective inhibition of 
the centers by adsorbed alcohol molecules and the second method is based on the 
utilization of Reaction 11-29. 
Kinetic data on propylene polymerization with the a-TiC13-AlEt3 catalytic 
system in the presence of small amounts of methanol are shown in Fig. 11-38. When 
this system is free from alcohol the polymerization proceeds at a constant rate from 
the beginning of the run (curve 7 in Fig. 11-38). When the amount of methanol is 
sufficient for the complete coverage of the a-TiC13 surface, the polymerization 
curves exhibit an induction period of ca. 25 min (due to alcohol removal from the 
surface) and an acceleration stage, the origin of which was discussed above. If the 
amount of alcohol added to the system is insufficient for complete catalyst surface 
coverage, the induction period is absent; the polymerization starts immediately 
after the addition of AlEt3 and proceeds with acceleration (curves 1-5 in Fig. 11-38). 
This phenomenon was attributed [127] to incomplete poisoning of active centers by 
alcohol rather than by incomplete surface coverage. The acceleration in these runs 
depends on two factors: (a) the liberation of new polymerization centers (blocked by 
alcohol molecules) and (b) a gradual formation ofhemi-alkoxides in Reaction 11-23, 
as in run 6. It is important that the polymerization reaction in the first moments 
proceeds on the same active centers as in the absence of alcohol though con-
centration of the centers is lower than in the blank run (run 7). The initial rates can 
be compared with the rate in the blank run in the following way 
(11-30) 
where C ROH is the alcohol concentration in the system and Co is the concentration of 
polymerization centers on the TiCl3 surface (mol/m2). In the blank run, Ro 
= kpCTiCI3SoCoCm.

coordinates of Eqn. II-31. The concentration of active centers on the catalyst 
surface calculated from the slope in this figure (for IX-TiCI3 with So = 7 m2/g) is 2.9 
x 1018 centers/m2, which corresponds to an area of ca. 35 A2 per polymerization 
center. The amount of Ti atoms in the centers constitutes ca. 0.5% of the total 
amount ofTi atoms in the catalyst and ca. 45% of the total amount ofTi atoms on 
the catalyst surface. This estimation is based on the assumption that one molecule of 
alcohol coordinates with and blocks one active center. 
Tritiated Alcohols as Polymerization Stoppers. The idea of the estimation of Cp by 
the interaction of the centers with tritium-labeled alcohols (Reaction II-29) is very 
appealing because it apparently allows the discrimination between most of the 
"dead" polymer molecules detached from active centers through chain transfer 
reactions (see Section 1-2-a) and those polymer chains which are connected to the 
centers at the moment when the alcohol is introduced into the polymerization 
system. Unfortunately, there are some other polymer molecules which are "dead" 
and still react with alcohols, those terminated via Reaction 1-6 (chain transfer with 
an organometallic compound) and bearing an organometallic group on their ends. 
This reaction can be represented by Reaction 11-28 if one substitutes one of the ethyl 
groups in an organoaluminum compound by an aliphatic polymer chain. Thus the 
reaction with a labeled alcohol allows one to estimate the combined amount of two 
types of polymer molecules, Cat -Polymer and AI-Polymer, which is designated as 
MPB (metal-polymer bonds). 
The expression for the amount of MPB in a polymerization system is [182, 193, 
196]: 
[MPB]total = Cp + IT R~Rdt 
(II-32) 
where R~R is the rate of chain transfer to MRx and T is polymerization duration. 

164 
II: Chemistry and Functioning of Heterogeneous Catalysts 
Equation 11-32 is valid only ifno other reactions involving a labeled alcohol and a polymer 
molecule take place. This problem was thoroughly examined in Ref. [199]. The possibility of 
polymer contamination with tritium through the catalytic isotope exchange between ROT 
and polymer molecules was discussed. Experiments [199] demonstrated that such exchange 
between ROT and polyethylene, isotactic polypropylene, poly-4-methyl-l-pentene, and 
polystyrene can be activated by cationic species (AlCI3, AIBuCI2, in petroleum ether at 60Â°C) 
present in some heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts. This means that a third term should 
be added to the right-hand side of Eqn. 11-32, that of (MPB)cxchange' The relative significance 
of this term depends on the type of catalytic system and the polymerization conditions. Of 
five exchange catalysts tested [199], VCI3 and Ali-Bu3 showed no exchange activity at all in 
the CH30T-polyolefin reactions and the activity of other catalysts increased in the order: 
Ali-Bu2CI 
(defined as I) 
< 
AlEtCI2 
(6.5) 
< 
AICI3 
(10.8) 
which parallels the order of Lewis acidity of these compounds. The study of different 
polyolefins gave an unexpected result: 
polypropylene 
(defined as 1) 
< 
poly-4-methyl-I-pentene 
(5.3) 
< 
polyethylene 
(67.5) 
< 
polystyrene. 
(248) 
Whereas the lability of polystyrene in this reaction is easy to understand, the high activity 
of polyethylene in the exchange reaction is mysterious and can not really be explained by the 
steric accessibility proposed in Ref. [199]. No interference from the exchange reaction is 
expected for propylene and 4-methyl-l-pentene polymerization with the IX-TiCI3-AIR3 and 
VCI3-AIR3 systems but problems can arise if commercial TiCI3 is used for this purpose (it 
contains AlCI3 as a component). However, independent studies showed that an apparently 
negligible exchange reaction occurs in the case of propylene polymerization with 8-
TiCI3Â· 0.33 AICI3 [197] and supported catalysts [248]: a very low (MPB),o,al value was 
determined for the 8-TiCI3-NEt3 system, at least 1000 times lower than that for the 8-
TiCI3-AlEt2CI and 8-TiCI3-AlEt3 systems (see Table 11-8). The same is true for TiCI2 in a 
pure state [200]. As to the possible role of AIR2CI as an exchange catalyst, the data presented 
in Ref. [199] showed that (MPB)cxchange for polypropylene in reaction with CH30T at 60Â°C is 
25 times lower than (MPB),o'al for propylene polymerization with the 8-TiCI3 . 0.33 
AlCI3-AIEt2CI system [188]. On the other hand, use of AlEtCI2 , especially for ethylene 
polymerization, can result in a gross overestimation of Cp if (MPB)exchange is neglected. 
The expression for Cp in a general case of olefin polymerization is very complex: 
see Sections I-2-b and I-2-c. However, if one takes into account the general ex-
pression for R~R 
(II-33) 
and the general expression for polymer yield 
(II-34) 
(compare with Eqn. 1-40) the second term in Eqn. II-32 can be presented as 
(k~R/kp)(CMRjCm)Q for constant Cm and CMR â¢ Then, dividing both sides of Eqn.

11-32 by CMX3, the concentration of transition metal halide in the system (mol/liter 
or g/liter), one obtains 
(11-35) 
It follows from Eqn. 11-35 that when some organometallic compound MRx is 
present in a polymerization system and if ~R > 0 the relative MPB amount should 
depend on two variables, Cp and Q. If Cp is constant with time, a linear dependence 
exists between [MPB]/CMX3 and Q. However, if Cp changes with time, which is 
typical for many highly active commercial catalysts (see Section I-2-c), the 
[MPB]/CMX3 versus Q dependence can be quite complex. 
The simplest situation exists when a polymerization system is entirely free of 
organometallic compounds. In such case the [MPB] change with time reflects the Cp 
change only. One of the examples of such simple systems is propylene polymeri-
zation with the "alkyl-free" oc-TiCI3-Et3N system which exhibits a very low catalytic 
activity [197] (see Fig. 11-40). The concentration of active centers Cp/CTiC13 is very 
low in this case and its apparent variation with time does not exceed the experi-
mental error. 
Estimation of Cp/CMX, by the reaction of a catalyst with ROT is characterized by

one unknown parameter, the kinetic isotope effect kH/kT â¢ A priori, this effect can be 
as high as 10 (judging from maximum kH/kD effects known), which could result in a 
substantial overestimation of Cp/ CMX3 ' Experimental estimations by different 
authors [108, 201, 202, 284] give its range as 1-4.5 which apparently determines the 
precision of the Cp measurement with this method. Some principal data on Cp values 
for propylene polymerization with TiC13-based systems are presented in Fig. 11-41 
in coordinates of Eqn. 11-35. As was discussed in Section 1-2-a, organometallic 
compounds participate in the chain transfer reaction 1-6 in a monomeric form,16 
16 Experimental data on [MPB]/CriCI, at high Q (when Cp/CriCI, Â« [MPB]/CriCI,) presented in Ref. [196] 
for different CA1El, confirm this conclusion.

167 
i.e., in the case of catalytic systems containing organoaluminum compounds, CMR 
= (KdissCAI)1/2, where CAl is the concentration of an organoaluminum compound. 
Thus, the experimental data for MPB are presented in Fig. II-41 in coordinates of 
[MPB]/ CTiCl3 (mol/mol) versus Q Cl~/ CTiCl3 Cm (liter1/2 /moI1/2). All catalytic systems 
represented in Fig. II-41 are characterized by a similar level of catalytic activity as 
can be seen from the caption to this figure. keff for these systems is in the range 2-S 
liter/mol' min. The following conclusions can be made from the data presented in 
Fig. II-41: 
(i) Independent data on MPB obtained by different authors coincide well, to a 
first approximation, and confirm the dependence presented by Eqn. 11-3S. 
When polymerization systems are stable [192, 194, 203] (Cp does not change 
with time) the linear dependence of [MPB]/CTicI3 on Q holds, at least for the 
initial periods of polymerization. Unexpectedly though, the same linear de-
pendence also holds when the polymerization rate steadily decreases with 
time [193]. On the other hand, when a kinetic curve exhibits pronounced 
acceleration [190] the [MPB]/CTiCl3 versus Q dependence deviates from linear-
ity at low Q (initial stages of the polymerization reaction) because, as can be 
seen from Eqns. 11-32 and 1-29, for t -+ 0 not only Q -+ I but also Cp -+ O. It is 
evident that extrapolation to Q = 0 cannot be used for Cp/CMX3 estimation in 
the case of polymerization reactions with pronounced acceleration stages. A 
similar situtation can be found, for example, in the case of 4-methyl-I-pentene 
polymerization with the VCI3-Ali-Bu3 system [14] which also exhibits an 
acceleration stage. 
(ii) Cp/CTiCI3 ratios (ordinate readings at Q = 0 in Fig. 11-41) fall in the range of 
(S-IS) x 10-3 mol/mol, i.e., polymerization centers constitute O.S to I.S% of 
all Ti atoms in these catalysts. These data are discussed further in Section 11-6. 
(iii) The slopes in Fig. 11-41 correspond to the ratios ~R Kdiss 1/2/kp for AlEt3 and 
AlEt2CI in the range (7.S-1S) x 10 -4 mol 1/2 /literl/2. This type of chain transfer 
reaction is one of the most important for propylene polymerization with the b-
TiCl3-based catalytic systems. For example, experimental estimations [193] 
showed that for polypropylene obtained for 30 min with the b-TiCI3-AlEt2CI 
catalytic system at SOÂ°C, from 9S% (short chains) to 40% (long chains) of all 
polymer molecules present in the system are connected to a metal atom (mostly 
AI).

For this reason olefin polymerization with the oc-TiCI3-AlEt3-HCI system closely 
resembles that with the oc-TiCI3-AlEt3-AlEt2Cl systems (see Section 11-4-2). Some 
kinetic results are presented in Fig. 11-42 (from Ref. [78]) and can be compared

qualitatively with data in Fig. II-33. The only apparent difference between the two 
systems is the composition of the polypropylene. At an [AlEt3] : [HCI] ratio of 1 the

TiCI3-AlEt2C1 system it is ca. 15%. 
Oxygen. The influence of dry O2 on the polymerization activity of heterogeneous

O2 at room and elevated temperature readily interacts with alkylaluminum com-
pounds in two stages [177] 
AIR3 + Oz ~ RzAIOOR 
(II-37) 
Thus, as a first approximation, the influence of Oz on the TiCI3-AIR3 catalytic 
systems should be equivalent to that of AIRzOR (discussed in Section II-4-e) or 
alcohols (discussed in Section II-5-b). Some experimental data on the correlation 
between catalytic activities of the TiC13-AlEt3 systems in ethylene and propylene 
polymerization and the [Oz] : [AlEt3] ratio are shown in Fig. II-43. The catalytic 
activity remains virtually unchanged or even increases slightly up to a molar 
[AlEtzOEt] : [AlEt3] ratio of I and then decreases. This is in agreement with the data 
presented in Fig. II-32. The apparent disagreement between the data on the catalytic

activity of pure AlEt20Et (this compound is inactive in combination with TiCl3 
when prepared in Reaction II-28 but active when prepared in Reaction II-37; see 
Fig. II-43) is probably related to the fact that Reaction II-37 is always accompanied 
by several radical side reactions giving many products that influence catalytic 
activity (7-9%, aldehydes, ketones, esters, etc.) and decrease the amount of 
AlEt20Et formed per mole of02. 
More complicated effects were found in the case of the b-TiCI3-AlEt3-02 
catalytic system [204] (propylene polymerization at 60Â°C). The catalytic activity of 
this system sharply decreases with time to some constant level (characterized by rate 
Ra,); see Section 1-2-c. This value monotonously decreases with the [02]/[AlEt3] 
ratio and is close to 0 when this ratio is 0.7. 
As was discussed in Section II-4-e the b-TiCI3-AlEt(OEt)CI catalytic system 
containing AICl3 in the solid phase exhibits substantial catalytic activity in olefin 
polymerization, apparently due to AlEt2CI formation in the reaction between 
AlEt(OEt)CI and the AICl3 present in b-TiC13 [170]. This effect as well as the 
peculiarities of olefin polymerization in the tertiary AlEt2CI-AlEt(OEt)CI-b-TiCl3 
system (see Section II-4-e) can explain the effect of oxygen on propylene polymeri-
zation with the b-TiCI3-AlEt2CI-02 system. The catalytic activity of this system 
(characterized by polymer yields after 2 h) slightly increases with increase in the 
amount of oxygen up to an atomic O/AI ratio!::::: I (i.e., the pure AlEt(OEt)CI-TiCl3 
system) and then falls sharply to a very low level. Virtually the same effect was found 
for the AlEt2CI-C2HsOH-b-TiCI3 system [184]. 

170 
II: Chemistry and Functioning of Heterogeneous Catalysts 
When oxygen is allowed to interact with TiC13 ftrst, the catalytic activity of the 
products formed (after their activation by an organometallic compound) depends 
on the type of TiC13. If fresh J-TiC13 samples react with O2 the activity of the 
subsequent catalyst always deteriorates [153, 184,204], especially if AlEt2Cl is used 
as a co-catalyst. On the other hand, it was reported that when P-TiC13 was used 
(obtained in the TiClcAlEt3 reaction) the oxidation of TiC13 in aliphatic and 
aromatic solvents proceeded as 
(II-38) 
and the species formed after reduction of these products with organometallic 
compounds exhibited enhanced catalytic activity. For this reason the presence of a 
small amount of O2 when ethylene is polymerized with the TiClcAlEt3 system 
([AI] : [Ti] ~ 1-2) results in the stabilization and substantial activation of the system 
[169]. 
Sulfur- and Selenium-Containing Compounds. 
The effect of H 2S and thiols on hetero-
geneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts resembles in many respects the much better evaluated effect 
of H 20 and alcohols. The interaction between thiols and alkylaluminum compounds results 
usually in the formation of aluminum thioalkoxides which affect olefin polymerization in a 
manner resembling that of aluminum alkoxides [IS3]. 
SeOCI2 is an effective poison for the fJ-TiCI3-AlEt3 system [205]. A possible form of the 
interaction between SeOCI2 and A1Et3 is: 
SeOCl2 + 2AIEt3 -+ 2AlEt2CI + EtSeOEt 
(11-39) 
(compare with the A1Et3-SOCI2 reaction [206, 207]) and selenoxide EtSeOEt or its complex 
with AlEt3 inhibits olefin polymerization. The fJ-TiCI3-A1Et3 system in propylene poly-
merization at 30-60Â°C exhibits a complex behavior described by kinetic curves similar to 
curve 4 in Fig. 1-1. The value of Roo decreases monotonously with the increase of the 
[SeOCI2] : [AIEt3] ratio and becomes negligible at a ratio close to 0.5, thus confirming Reac-
tion 11-39. The equilibrium constant K for the competition between A1Et3 and the product 
of its reaction with SeOCI2 estimated using Eqn. II-IS from the data presented in Ref. [205] 
changes from 1.2-1.S at 31Â°C to 4.9 at 61 Â°C. If SeOCI2 is allowed to interact with fJ-TiCI3 
prior to the introduction of AIEt3 its inhibiting effect on propylene polymerization is even 
more strongly pronounced. A [SeOCI21 : [A1Et31 ratio ca. 0.25 is sufficient for the complete 
inhibition of the reaction due to its strong adsorption on the TiCI3 surface which apparently 
prevents the formation of active centers. 
II-5-e. Organic Esters, Ketones, and Ethers 
Organic esters (mostly esters of aromatic acids) are widely used in the practice of 
Ziegler-Natta catalysis as modifters of highly isospeciftc supported catalysts for 
polymerization of oleftns (see Section II-I-c). Usually they are used in two different 
ways: (a) as a part of the solid component of such catalysts (a typical example is the 
product obtained by grinding MgC12 in the presence of ethyl benzoate with the 
subsequent deposition of TiC14 on the ground mixture) and (b) as modifters of 

11-5: Effects of Catalyst Poisons and Modifiers 
171 
organoaluminum compounds. The principal reason for their application as 
modifiers is their ability to poison selectively nonspecific polymerization centers 
[151, 189,208-210]. 
A good example of this selective poisoning is presented in Ref. [151] where the 
effect of ethyl benzoate was examined in propylene polymerization with the 
AlEt3- TiC14/MgC12 system at 41Â°C. Increase of the [ester] : [AlEt3] ratio from 0 to 
0.25 has only a small effect on the rate of propylene polymerization to isotactic 
polymer: R. decreases from 440 to 300 g/gTiÂ· h. However, the rate of the formation 
of amorphous polypropylene decreases from 400 to 20 gig Ti . h in the same region, 
i.e., the fraction of amorphous polypropylene in the total product decreases from 48 
to 6%. These effects are discussed in more detail in Chapter IV (Section IV-I-b) 
where the distribution of polymerization centers with respect to isospecificity is 
examined. 
Typically AlEt3 is mixed with the organic ester in a ratio of 3 : 1 to 2.5 : 1 in an 
inert solvent and then the mixture is added to the solid component of the catalyst, 
followed by the introduction of a monomer. The first step of the interaction between 
an organic ester and any trialkylaluminum compound is the very rapid formation of 
a 1 : 1 complex [183, 189,206,211,212,285]: 
AlR3 + R'C( O)-OR" -+ R3Al +- O=C(R')OR" 
(11-40) 
The complex can be easily identified by its infrared spectrum: it is characterized 
by a long-wavelength shift of the C=O stretching band and by a simultaneous 
short-wavelength shift of the acid c-o band. These shift ranges are: for the 
AlEt3-vinyl acetate complex; 1760 -+ 1679 cm-I and 1220 -+ 1325 cm-I ; for the 
AlEt3-methyl methacrylate complex, 1725 -+ 1670 cm-I and 1305, 1328 -+ 1340, 
1360 cm-I ; for the AlEt3-ethyl benzoate complex, 1730 -+ 1664 cm-1 and 1223 
-+ 1328 cm-1 [189, 213, 285]. 
The complex formed in Reaction 11-40 is relatively stable only in the absence of 
free AlR3 [212, 214, 285]. If AlR3 is in excess (a situation typical for the application 
of esters as modifiers), ester reduction takes place [183,189,211,212,215,216,285] 
(11-41) 
Infrared studies [189, 285] showed that interaction of AlEt3 and ethyl benzoate at 
25Â°C (concentrations of the reactants ca. 0.1 mol/liter) yields Et2AlOEt, 
Et2AlOC(Et)2Ph, and minor amounts of other aluminum alkoxides. 
A UV method was used to study the kinetics of Reaction 11-41 under conditions 
similar to those employed in using esters as catalyst modifiers (in heptane, at a 
concentration of ca. 10 mmol/liter in the 25-75Â°C range) [189]. This reaction 
involves a second-order interaction between the complex (formed in Reaction 11-40) 
and free AlEt3:

C Aging at reagent concentrations five times higher than those in the polymerization reaction. 
Rate constants of this reaction at 25, 50, and 75Â°C were 2.9 liter/molÂ· min (an 
average value for the reaction at different AlEt3 : ester ratios), 14.4, and 59.6 
liter/mol' min, respectively, which corresponds to Eac! + 12.5 kcal/mol (52.0 
kJ /mol). The reactivity of the aromatic acid esters in their reaction with AlEt3 
depends on their structures. When ethyl anisate reacted with AlEt3 under similar 
conditions at 50Â°C the rate constant of Reaction II-41-a was found to be 2.4 times 
less than that for ethyl benzoate. 
These data indicate tliat the AlEt3-aromatic ester complexes formed in Reaction 
II-40 disappear from the reaction systems due to their conversion into a mixture of 
aluminum alkoxides in Reaction II-41. 
Table II-7 contains data on ethylene polymerization with the TiCI4/ 
MgCI2-AlEt3-aromatic acid ester system aged in the absence of monomer for 
different periods of time. Apparently this aging and transformation of the esters 
into alkoxides (in all these aging experiments less than 2% of the original 
AlEt3-ester complex remains unconverted) does not result in any significant de-
terioration of the catalyst performance. Similar results were reported in Ref. [151]: 
preliminary aging of the AlEt3-ethyl benzoate (4: 1) mixture at 20Â°C does not 
change its effect on subsequent propylene polymerization at 41Â°C in the presence of 
the TiCI4/MgCI2 catalyst. 
The overall effect of organic esters was known long before the advent of sup-
ported catalysts for olefin polymerization. For example, Fig. II-44(A) shows the 
effect of ethyl acetate on propylene polymerization with the 0(-TiC13-AlEt3 system

[183]. The system becomes completely inactive when the AlEt3 : ethyl acetate ratio 
decreases to 2, which corresponds to a complete removal of free AlEt3 from the 
system in Reaction 11-41. A very similar picture emerged when the effect of another 
ester, methyl p-toluate, on the highly active TiCI4/MgCI2-AIEt3 system in propyl-
ene polymerization at 70Â°C was examined [2lO]. These experimental data are 
presented in coordinates of "catalyst productivity" versus [Et2AIOR] : [AlEt3] in 
Fig. 11-44-(B). It was assumed that Reaction II-41 is virtually complete, i.e., each 
ester molecule produces two molecules of aluminum alkoxide. The general shape of 
the dependence in Fig. 11-44-(B) is similar to that in Fig. 11-32, where the effect of the 
[Et2AIOEt] : [AlEt3] ratio was examined. This similarity suggests that aluminum 
alkoxides play an important role in the performance of these supported catalysts. 
However, attempts to replace aromatic acid esters in these systems by synthetic 
mixtures of the aluminum alkoxides expected in Reaction 11-41 were only partially 
successful [189]: the isotactic fraction typical for the former systems (96-94% of 
polypropylene insoluble in boiling heptane, see Table 11-7) could be reached only at 
the expense of a significant (at least 5-6-fold) reduction in catalyst activity. It 
should be remembered that all soluble components of these catalytic systems (free 
AIR3, its complex with an aromatic acid ester, aluminum alkoxides formed in 
Reaction II-41, etc.) exist in a complex equilibrium state that includes several 
complexes (all aluminum compounds form complexes with esters) and hemi-
alkoxides (Reaction 11-23) [189, 216]. Apparently when esters are used for the 
preparation of catalytic systems, the resulting complex mixture of various co-
catalysts provides an optimum combination which poisons most of the nonspecific 
polymerization centers but leaves most of the isospecific centers available for olefin 
polymerization. 
Figure II-44(A) presents data for propylene polymerization with the a-
TiC13-AlEt3 system in the presence of acetone [183]. According to Refs. [177], [206], 
and [211] the interaction between AlEt3 and acetone produces aluminum alkoxides 
in a hemi-alkoxide form, for example

Figure TI-45. Kinetic data for propylene polymerization with the fJ-TiCI3-AlEt3-diethyl 
ether system at 41Â°C in coordinates of Eqn. 11-17. Experimental data are from Ref. [217]. 
Ketones are usually more reactive than esters in this interaction with AIR3 [212]. 
This reaction qualitatively explains the data shown in Fig. 11-44(A): at low 
[acetone] : [AlEt3] ratios the effective polymerization rate constant remains practi-
cally unaffected by acetone; then, when the ratio is 0.8-1, it gradually declines and 
the system becomes completely deactivated at a ratio close to 1. This behavior 
resembles closely that of the TiCI3-AlEt3-AlEt20R systems (see Fig. 11-32). 
Complexation between trialkylaluminum compounds and dialkyl ethers is well 
documented [177, 206]. The effect of diethyl ether on kinetics of propylene poly-
merization with the {}-TiC13-AlEt3 system was described in Ref. [217]. This catalyst 
exhibits the unstable kinetic behavior schematically shown earlier (Figure I-I, curve 
4). When the rates for the final stationary stages of this reaction (Roo) were 
compared, the effect of diethyl ether was straightforward: the Roo value decreased 
monotonously as the [ether] : [AlEt3] ratio increased and became negligible when 
this ratio was close to 1, indicating that the Et20Â· AlEt3 complex was inactive as a 
co-catalyst. The equilibrium constant for the competition between AlEt3 and its 
complex was calculated with the application of Eqn. 11-15 from the kinetic data 
presented in Ref. [217] (see Fig. 11-45). It is equal to 4.7 at 41Â°C. 
However when the maximum polymerization rates were compared, the effect of 
the ether was found to be more complex. If the amount of ether was small, at [ether] : 
[AlEt3] ratios up to 0.25, the polymerization system became more active: its Rmax 
increased ca. 25% and its activation time shortened from ~ 10 to ~ 5 min. Only a

175 
subsequent increase of the [ether]: [AlEt3] ratio to 0.7 manifested itself in a gradual 
Rmax drop. This behavior probably involves a chemical modification of the reaction 
system: complexation of the ether with both TiCl3 and AICl3 moieties in com-
mercial b-TiCl3 is possible. 
II-5-f. 
Amines 
Amines are some of the most widely used ligands in coordination chemistry. There is 
no surprise then that the effect of amines on olefin polymerization with transition 
metal compounds has been studied by many authors. Depending on their structure, 
amines interact differently with organometallic compounds. The principal products 
in the case of trisubstituted amines are 1 : 1 complexes whereas mono- and disub-
stituted amines undergo chemical transformations in reactions with metal-carbon 
bonds. 
We will discuss trisubstituted amines first. The 1 : 1 complexes of these com-
pounds with AIR3 are stable [177, 206] and are usually thought to be the most 
probable components of the reaction systems utilizing these amines. However, 
careful examination reveals a more complex picture indicating some difference 
between the action of free amines and their complexes. 
Triethylamine is one of the most studied modifiers for heterogeneous 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts. Its effect was evaluated in propylene and I-butene poly-
merization with TiClrbased catalysts [216, 218-220] and in 4-methyl-I-pentene 
polymerization with VCI3-based catalysts [171]. The reported data are very complex 
and are not open to any straightforward interpretation. For example, if a free amine 
is added in the course of an established polymerization process with the b-
TiC13-AlEt3 system (propylene polymerization, 70Â°C, [220]) its effect is always 
deterimental; the polymerization rate immediately drops and the degree of activity 
decrease parallels the amount of added Et3N. On the other hand, when free Et3N is 
added to the established process of 4-methyl-l-pentene polymerization with the 
VCI3-Ali-Bu3 system at 30Â°C [171] its effect depends on the ratio between Ali-Bu3 
and Et3N. If this ratio is close to or more than 1, the polymerization rate also nearly 
instantly drops to a reduced level, the degree of the reduction being parallel to the 
Et3N amount. However, if the Et3N/Ali-Bu3 ratio is much less than 1 the rate of 4-
methyl-l-pentene polymerization equally rapidly increases by a factor of up to ca. 
2.5, thus ruling out a simple poisoning hypothesis. Additional findings should be 
considered to realize the complexity of the situation: 
(i) Whereas complex formation between R3N and organometallic compounds is 
firmly established, the equilibria of these reactions under conditions typical for 
olefin polymerization (temperatures 30-100Â°C, high dilution of solutions) 
have never been thoroughly examined. The equilibria obviously depend on the 
type of organometallic compound [171, 218, 219]. 
(ii) Transition metal halides easily form complexes with amines [171, 221]. These 
complexes, while inactive by themselves [171], can be easily activated for olefin 
polymerization in the presence of organometallic compounds [171, 221]. 

176 
II: Chemistry and Functioning of Heterogeneous Catalysts 
Judging by the stereo-compositions of the polyolefins they produce, the 
MCI3-Donor-M'Rx systems cannot be reduced to similar MCI3-M'Rx sy-
stems [218, 219, 221]. This suggests a direct participation of amines or the 
products of their transformations in the polymerization reactions. 
(iii) If a preformed AlEt3 . Et3N complex is added to the established polymeriza-
tion system with the <5-TiCI3-AlEt3 catalyst [216,220] it produces a modifying 
rather than a poisoning effect in propylene polymerization: both the shape of 
kinetic curves and the stereo-composition of the polypropylene change. Kine-
tic data [220] show that the <5-TiCI3-AlEt3-AlEt3 . Et3N system resembles to a 
significant extent the TiCI3-AlEt3-AlEt2Cl system (see Figs. 11-33 and 11-34): 
at [Complex] : [AlEt3] ratios up to 2-2.5 initial keff values remain very close to 
that for the unmodified system but at higher [Complex] : [AlEt3] ratios keff 
decreases by a factor of 3-4 and stabilizes at this level. 
(iv) Addition of trialkylamines can partially solubilize transition metal halides 
[171]. The solubilized products form additional polymerization catalysts with 
organoaluminum compounds, thus making the interpretation of the overall 
amine effect even more uncertain. 
These data imply that numerous interactions are possible in reaction systems 
containing amines, transition metal compounds, and organometallic compounds. 
The relative significance of these interactions in olefin polymerization reactions 
depends on many variables which makes attempts to develop a unified explanation 
of the amine effect in these reactions very difficult. 
The size of alkyl groups in trialkylamines also influences their effect on olefin 
polymerization. For example, sterically hindered tribenzylamine can form com-
plexes with AlEt3 [206] but its bulky substituents decrease the equilibrium constant 
of this complex formation (or reduce the inhibition activity of the complex), and the 
presence of this compound in a polymerization system has virtually no effect on the 
polymerization activity even at high [tribenzylamine] : [AlEt3] ratios [183]; see Fig. 
11-44(A). This phenomenon explains why both homopolymerization of unsaturated 
amines CH2=CH(CH2hNR2 (R = i-Pr, i-Bu and their copolymerization with 
olefins are possible with the <5-TiCI3-AIR2CI and <5-TiCI3-AIR3 systems (R=Et, 
i=Bu) in benzene at 50-60Â°C for [amine] : [AI] ratios as high as 3 [222]. 
The effect of secondary amines on Ziegler-Natta catalysts has been examined 
much less extensively than the effect oftrialkylamines [183, 216]. It is known that the 
N-H bond is highly reactive with trialkylaluminum compounds [177, 206]: 
Judging by experimental data presented in Ref. [183] (see Fig. 11-44(AÂ» on the 
effect of Et2NH and by analogy with the previously described role of aluminum 
alkoxides (Section 11-4-e), one can assume that aluminum amides R2AINR~ form 
I : 1 complexes with AIR3 which are active co-catalysts. As a result, polymerization 
activity of the IX-TiCI3-AlEt3-Et2NH system remains approximately constant until 
the [Et2AINEt2]: [AlEt3] ratio is less than 1 (corresponds to [NEt2H]: 
[AlEt3] ~ 0.5) and then the activity decreases to zero for pure Et2AINEt2. 

II-5: Effects of Catalyst Poisons and Modifiers 
177 
Conversion in the reaction between AIEt3 and dialkylamine depends on the size 
of the amine alkyl group. i-Pr1NH and t-BuNHn-Bu behave similarly to EtlNH 
[216]: when added in a 1 : 5 ratio to AIEt3 they only mildly affect the yield of 
polypropylene obtained with the TiCI4 /MgCl1 catalyst, whereas at a 1 : 1 ratio the 
catalyst efficiency decreases by a factor of 10-I 4. On the other hand, sterically more 
bulky 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine has no influence on isospecific centers of this 
catalyst but poisons a significant fraction of nonspecific centers [216]. In this respect 
this compound resembles alcohols with bulky alkyl groups mentioned in Sections 
II-5-e and IV-I-b. 
ll-5-g. Modification of TiCI3-AlEtCl2 Systems 
Combinations of transition metal halides and AIRClz cannot polymerize olefins with the 
formation of isotactic "head-to-tail" polymers.'7 AIRClz is inadequate for this purpose for 
two reasons: its alkylating power is insufficient for the formation of alkyl derivatives of 
transition metal halides, a prerequisite for the formation ofisospecific polymerization centers 
(see Section II-2), and this compound, when added to a working catalytic system, substitutes 
other organometallic compounds in the centers and blocks them (Section II-4-e). It was 
discovered, however, that many organic molecules with electron-donor properties and some 
non-transition metal halides, when added to TiCI 3-AIRClz systems, make them active for 
isospecific olefin polymerization [161, 165, 190,223-226]. One of the donor molecules that 
has received much attention is hexamethylphosphorous triamide [161, 190,225,226]. Com-
plex correlations were found between the [Donor] : [AlEtClz] ratio in the 0.2-0.8 range, the 
catalytic activity of the TiCI3-AlEtClz-Donor system [161, 190], the stereospecificity of this 
system, and the molecular weight distribution of the polypropylene formed [225]. 
Two explanations have been proposed for the donor effect: 
(i) An active organometallic component in these systems is the complex AlEtCI2 â¢ xD where 
D is a donor molecule and the coefficient x depends on the donor type. Usually x = 1; in 
the case of hexamethylphosphorous triamide x = i [226] or 1 [227]. 
(ii) Donor compounds cause the dismutation reaction of AIRCI 2 : 
2(AIRClz)2 + 2D ---+ 2AICI3 . D + (AlRzClh 
(II-42) 
This reaction is favored thermodynamically due to the high stability of AlCl3 â¢ D com-
plexes [165]. 
I H-NMR study of several systems containing AIMeClz and Lewis bases in toluene solution 
at [Donor]: [AIMeClz] = 0.5 in the 38-60DC range [228] showed the presence both of 
AIMeClz'D and (AIMezClh compounds in comparable amounts as well as the presence of 
methylaluminum sesquichloride AlMeClz . AlMez Cl and the AlMe2 Cl . D complex, The 
relative amounts of these products depended of the system composition, temperature, and 
the reaction duration. The equilibrium constant for the reaction

in toluene solution at -40Â°C is 0.45 [180], whereas for the system containing AIMeBr2 it is 
0.064, and in the case of AlMeI2 it is 0.023 [227]. The results of IR studies are in agreement 
with these findings [180, 229]: intense bands in the 550-500 cm -I range assigned to AlCl3 . D 
complexes (D = pyridine, triethylamine, hexamethylphosphorous triamide) were found in 
the IR spectra of the AIMeCI2-D systems in toluene solutions at [AIMeCI2] : [Donor] = ca. 
2, in addition to the bands of AlMeCl2 . D complexes, 18 thus confirming Reaction II-43. It 
was found also that when the [Donor] : [AIMeCI2] ratio approaches 1 a rapid quantitative 
recombination reaction takes place [130, 227]

The fact that the polymerization activity of the TiCI3-AlEtCI2- Donor systems reaches a 
maximum at [Donor] : [AIEtCI2] = ca. 0.5 strongly suggests that the real active co-catalyst in 
these systems is AIEt2Cl [165], or, at least, that this compound is responsible for the 
formation of polymerization centers. However, the role of AIRCI2Â· D complexes as possible 
co-catalysts for the centers formed by AIR2 Cl is still not clear. 
U-5-h. 
Poisons Mainly Affecting Active Centers 
Some of the well-known poisons of heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts do not 
(or virtually do not) interact with organometallic compounds; they affect catalysts 
primarily by interacting directly with polymerization centers. The most studied 
poisons of this type are CO, CO2 , CS2 , acetylene, and allene. Preliminary studies 
[183] revealed high effectiveness of these compounds as catalyst poisons. For 
example, they are more active than water or H 2 S. 
Carbon Monoxide and Carbon Dioxide. 
A thorough study of the effect of CO and 
CO2 on olefin polymerization with heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts was 
presented in Refs. [124], [159], [196], and [230]-[236]. Typical examples of the effects 
of CO and C02 19 are shown in Fig. II-46 for propylene polymerization with the 
relatively stable o-TiCI3-AlEt2CI catalytic system at 50Â°C. Similar effects were 
found for ethylene polymerization with the same system [234] as well as for ethylene 
and propylene polymerization with the o-TiCI3-AlEt3 system when poisoned by 
CO [233, 234]. 
It can be seen from Fig. II-46 that both CO and CO2 instantly "kill" the 
polymerization20 but that this effect is partly (Fig. II-46) or nearly completely [233] 
reversible: when such "dead" polymerization systems are evacuated and fresh 
monomer is added to them the catalytic activity is rapidly restored. The degree of 
this restoration depends on the duration of the exposure of the polymerization 
18 A characteristic band of the AIMe2CI dimer and AIMeCI2Â· AlMe2CI in the 544-549 cm- I range has 
medium intensity and cannot be identified in these spectra with certainty due to its overlap with the 
intense bands of AlCI3Â· D and AIMeCI2' D complexes [180]. 
19C02 interacts with such organometallic compounds as AlEt3 [177, 206] with the formation of 
AlEt20Et when excess AIEt3 is present. 
20CO is 10-100 times more effective as a poison than CO2 [235, 236].

centers to CO. When it is short, the restoration is nearly complete [233, 234] but even 
after a prolonged exposure of the catalysts to CO (17 h at 50Â°C) they regenerate ca. 
40% of their activity after CO evacuation and the admission of fresh monomer 
[234]. 
These effects can be attributed to a reversible chemisorption of CO or CO2 on 
polymerization centers without their destruction. The dependence of residual 
catalyst activity (which is proportional to the amount of unpoisoned catalytic 
centers) on the amount of CO2 added to a polymerization system (based on data in 
Ref. [234]) is plotted in Fig. II-47 using the coordinates of the Langmuir adsorption 
equation 
(11-44) 
where k~ff is the effective polymerization constant in the absence of poison and K is 
the Langmuir adsorption constant. It can be seen that a significant deviation exists 
from the simple Langmuir adsorption law indicating adsorption nonequivalence of 
polymerization centers, the apparent adsorption constant K changing from ~ 300 
liter/mol for the most active polymerization centers to ~ 75 liter/mol for the centers 
most stable to the poisoning. A similar nonequivalence of the centers is manifested 
in the data for CO adsorption also. Such inhomogeneity of active centers is a general

phenomenon in heterogeneous catalysis. This problem is discussed in more detail in 
Chapter IV. 
Catalyst deactivation by CO2 does not depend on the type of olefin used (ethylene 
and propylene) or AIEt2Cl concentration (6.9 x 10-2 mol/liter for propylene poly-
merization,2.08 x 10-2 mol/liter for ethylene polymerization), which confirms the 
simple nature of the poisoning effect. Apparently the heat of adsorption for CO and 
CO2 on these centers is significant and in some cases several repeated evacuation 
steps are necessary for the complete release of these compounds from the centers 
(see Fig. 11-45) and the restoration of the polymerization activity to a final station-
ary level takes 15-30 min [233, 234]. 
When 14CO and 14C02 were used for these poisoning experiments it became 
immediately apparent that the radioactive label can be transferred to polymers [231, 
232]. These results were attributed to the insertion of CO or CO2 into the transition 
metal-carbon bond, the active bond of a polymerization center. This conlusion was 
confirmed by IR experiments [286]. The insertion reaction proceeds through a 
coordination stage

A subsequent addition of alcohol to the polymerization system destroys the 
temporarily "paralyzed" polymerization center and introduces a carbonyl group 
into the polymer chain [240].

Kinetic experiments show [124, 230, 233, 284, 286] that the amount of carbonyl 
groups in polymers increases in time when CO is allowed to react with 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts in the presence of a monomer; see Fig. II-48. 
Two alternative explanations were presented to account for this behavior: 
(i) The insertion of coordinated CO and CO2 (the second step in Reaction II-45) is 
a slow process and the data shown in Fig. II-48 as well as similar data [124, 230, 
232, 284, 286] reflect its development [234]. In usual experiments with short 
exposure of a catalyst to CO (as in Fig. II-45) even after the complete inhibition 
of the polymerization activity there is only time for CO insertion into a few 
percent of the metal-carbon bonds and the rest of the adsorbed CO can be 
easily released when the system is evacuated. This explains why the total 
amount of radioactive tags from 14CO or 14C02 in polymer, when extrapolated 
to zero time,21 is usually significantly lower than the amount of polymerization 
21 As can be seen from Fig. II-48, this extrapolation is not especially precise due to the significant scatter 
of the experimental data. This amount can be more simply estimated approximately as the number of 
tags after some particular exposure, 5 or 10 min, for example.

II: Chemistry and Functioning of Heterogeneous Catalysts 
centers estimated by other poisoning methods, e.g., with radioactive alcohols 
(see Section II-4c). For example, the ratio between the polymer molecules 
labeled with 14CO and Cp (estimated by reaction with CH30H) for ethylene 
polymerization with the b-TiCI3-AlEt3 system is 0.055-0.11 and with the 
TiCI4-AlEt2CI system ca. 0.01 [196], whereas the estimation of the same ratio 
for propylene polymerization varies over a wide range, from 0.0045 
(CO)-0.0115 (C02) [232] and 0.13 (CO) [240] for the b-TiCI3-AlEt2Cl system 
to 0.65 (CO) [196] for the b-TiCI3-AlEt3 system, and to 0.24-0.36 for the 
TiCI4/MgCI2/ester-AlEt3/ester systems [284]. 
The growth of the 14C content in a polymer can be prevented ifPR3 is added 
to the polymerization medium after the 14CO admittance. PR3 is a more 
strongly coordinated ligand than CO and it displaces CO from the coordination 
complex [231, 232] whereas CO cannot displace PR3 when added to the system 
after it [231]. 
(ii) An alternative explanation of data similar to those presented in Fig. II-48 is as 
follows [233]: This kinetic curve consists of two different stages: (a) the rapid 
insertion of the first CO (or CO2) molecule into the metal-polymer bond 
(Reaction II-45) which is completed after ~ 5-10 min and (b) the subsequent 
slow copolymerization of CO and olefin. Acceleration of the polymerization 
reaction after the CO evacation and readmission of monomer can be attributed 
in this case to the unblocking of polymerization centers M-C(=O)-Poly-
mer by removal of coordinated CO and their participation in the polymeriza-
tion reaction. If this reasoning is correct, the ordinate intersection of the curve 
in Fig. II-48 represents the amount of polymerization centers in a catalytic 
system. 
Published data [241,242] favor strongly the first explanation of the effects related 
to CO and CO2 poisoning. If the active centers of the b-TiCI3-AlEt2CI system 
(propylene polymerization at 60Â°C) are poisoned by CO2 after monomer is removed 
from the polymerization system (i.e., when the copolymerization reaction between 
propylene and CO2 is impossible), the amount of radioactive tags in the polymers 
increases with an increase of exposure to CO2 for 5-6 h, much in the same way as it 
increases in the presence of monomer (Fig. II-48). This can be attributed to the slow 
second step of Reaction II-45 [241]. The same effect was found when, after the 
TiCI4/TiCI3-AlEt2Cl system (Solvay catalyst) was poisoned by 14CO, propylene 
was replaced with N 2: incorporation of CO into the polymer chain continued for ca. 
2 h and resulted in a twofold increase of the polymer 14C content [243]. On the other 
hand, the TiCI4/MgCI2/ethyl benzoate-AlEt3 system in characterized by a high rate 
for the second step in Reaction II-45 [243]. These findings provided the basis for a 
new method for the estimation of propagation rate constants and the amount of 
polymerization centers based on CO and CO2 poisoning [242]. 
According to this method, an aliquot of a polymerization slurry is removed from 
a reactor, stripped from monomer, washed free of organoaluminum compounds, 
and then is poisoned with 14CO or 14C02 for different periods of time. The removal 
of organoaluminum compounds is necessary to prevent the following exchange 
reaction

The application of this method to propylene polymerization with the (j-
TiCl3 . 0.33AICI2-AlEt2CI system at 60Â°C and a monomer pressure of 1.07 bar gave 
the following results. When 14C02 was allowed to react with the live polymerization 
centers for 20 min, only the most active centers underwent Reaction II-45. They 
were characterized by kp = 35 liter/molÂ· s and constituted only 0.47% of all Ti 
atoms in the system. However, when the poisoning was continued for 22 h, Reaction 
II-45 was completed at all centers, which amounted to 1.2% of all Ti atoms. They 
were characterized by kp = 13 liter/molÂ· s [242]. 
An alternative method was developed for the measurement of the amount of 
polymerization centers based on the high efficiency of CO and CO2 as catalyst 
poisons [243, 244]. According to this method, small amounts of the poisons are 
added successively to the same reaction system. Each addition results in a nearly 
instantaneous decrease of polymerization activity due to the high affinity of these 
compounds for active centers (the first stage of Reaction II-45). If the reduced 
polymerization rate is plotted vs. the amount of the added poison, complete catalyst 
deactivation will be noted when the amount of poison added is equal to the number 
of polymerization centers (assuming a 1: 1 ratio between the poison molecules and 
the transition metal atoms in the complexes). Of course, CO or CO 2 can, in 
principle, adsorb on some other species on the catalyst surface in addition to the 
polymerization centers. Thus, the method provides information about the lowest 
possible concentration of polymerization centers. This approach was applied to 
several catalysts for propylene polymerization, both conventional and supported 
[210,243,245,246]. 
Carbon Disulfide. 
CS2 and COS are effective poisons for heterogeneous 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts [183]. Infrared studies showed that no chemical reaction 
takes place between equimolar mixtures ofCS2 and AlEt3 (0.1 mol/liter solutions in 
heptane) at 20Â°C. This indicates that CS2 itself, rather than its complex with AlEt3, 
inhibits olefin polymerization [247]. 
The simplest example of poisoning with CS2 is its effect on the kinetically stable 
a-TiC13-AlEt3 system. If CS2 is mixed with AlEt3 and then added to a-TiCl3 the 
process of propylene polymerization with this system at 70Â°C exhibits the same 
stable behavior as does the original a-TiCI3-AlEt3 system (see Section I-2-a) but 
with sharply reduced polymerization rate due to the poisoning. A CS2 concen-
tration in the reaction medium of 4 x 10-3 mol/liter is sufficient to decrease the 
effective rate constant by a factor of '" 25. Equation II-44 can be applied for the 
quantitative description of the effect ofCS2 on this catalytic system. The adsorption 
constant K in this equation is 5 x 103 liter/mol for CS2 at 70Â°C, i.e., the poisoning 
effect of CS2 is much higher than that of CO2 (compare with Fig. II-47). 
More diversified effects ofCS2 were found in the case of the (j-TiCI3-AlEt3 and 
(j-TiCI3-AlEt2CI systems [247]; see Fig. II-49(A). The (j-TiCI3-AlEt3 system ex-
hibits an unstable kinetic behavior (quantitatively described in Section I-2-c). This is

shown by the two upper curves in Fig. II-49(A). Addition of small amounts of CSz 
to this system results in a drastic decrease of the initial polymerization rate (propyl-
ene, 70 DC, in heptane). On the other hand, the effect ofCSz on the b-TiCI3-AlEtzCI 
is less pronounced. A study of the influence of CSz concentration on the initial 
catalyst activity (Fig. II-49(B)) revealed two opposite effects. At very low 
[CSz]: [TiCI3] ratios, CSz activates b-TiCI3-AlEt3 catalytic systems, but the further 
increase of this ratio results in rapid poisoning. However, some part of the poly-
merization centers remains unaffected by CSz even at high concentrations. 
Fractionation of the polypropylene samples obtained in these experiments 
showed that CSz is a more effective poison for the centers oflow stereospecificity than 
for highly stereospecific centers. A comparison of the effects of CSz on the 15-
TiC13-AlEt3 and 15-TiCI3-AlEtzCI systems indicated that both these systems contain 
some amount of polymerization centers that are virtually unaffected by CS2 . These 
centers provide 50% of the 15-TiCI3-AlEtzCI system activity but only 8-10% of the 
15-Ti Cl3 - AlEt3 system activity. A comparison of the molecular weights and fraction 
compositions of polypropylene obtained from these unpoisonable centers showed 
their close similarity. 
Acetylene. 
Acetylene and its derivatives are potent poisons for Ziegler-Natta 
catalysts. The specificity of the effect of acetylene lies in the fact that it slowly 
polymerizes with these catalysts to form black insoluble polymers consisting of 
conjugated linear chains with trans-substituted C=C bonds [248]. 
When acetylene is present as an impurity in olefins, two effects are noted [249]: 
(i) Polymerization rates decrease sharply; the decrease correlates with the amount of 
acetylene in the mixture. 
(ii) Polymers and copolymers of olefins formed in the presence of acetylene are 
colored from blue to violet and black depending on the acetylene concentration in 
the polymerization system. These polymer products are soluble in hydro-
carbons, for example, in tetralin at 135 DC (the solutions are colored also) and 
are truly olefin-acetylene copolymers containing relatively long, conjugated 
double bond sequences. Infrared spectra of these polymers exhibit the 1015 
cm -1 band characteristic of polyacetylene (the out-of-plane bending mode of 
conjugated trans-CH=CH units) and these conjugated blocks easily form 
Diels-Alder ad ducts with dienophiles (e.g., tetracyanoethylene, at 100-l30DC). 
These effects can be explained in the following way. Acetylene effectively adsorbs 
on polymerization centers and blocks them, i.e., it behaves as a true catalytic poison. 
After adsorption it slowly incorporates into polyolefin chains, similarly to CO and 
CO2 (see Reaction II-45). However, in contrast to CO, acetylene can form polymer 
chains and its increased coordination ability compared with that of olefins apparently 
explains the formation of long acetylene blocks, even in copolymers with an overall 
low acetylene content. Another possible explanation of the acetylene poisoning effect 
is the decreased activity of polymerization centers immediately after acetylene inser-
tion into a polymer chain:

Experimental data on the acetylene effect in ethylene-propylene copolymerization 
with the VOC13-Ali-Bu3 catalytic system at - 20Â°C are presented in Fig. II-50 (from 
Ref. [249]). 
The complex dependence of the copolymerization rate on the acetylene: monomer 
concentration ratio (see Section 1-4) prevents a ready quantitative comparison of 
mean rate values at different ethylene concentrations. The treatment of these data (for 
PC2H4 = 3.6 atm) in the coordinates of Eqn. II-44 is presented as an insert in Fig. 
II-50. The dependence is not linear (the same phenomenon as for CO2 , see Fig. II-47) 
which can be attributed to the nonequivalence of polymerization centers with 
respect to acetylene poisoning.

but with a significant proportion of head-to-head attached monomer units (see 
Section III-I-b). The melting point of the polymer is ca. 125Â°C and decreases as the 
amount of monomer inversion increases. 
When admitted to systems where olefin polymerization is proceeding, allene 
behaves much in the same way as acetylene: it sharply reduces the rate of olefin 
consumption in the reaction and participates in the copolymerization reaction with 
olefins.

with 
the 
b-
TiCl3 . 0.33AICI3-AlEt2CI system at 60Â°C were described [243, 253]. When a small 
amount of allene is injected into a reactor in which stationary polymerization of 
propylene is taking place a fast and sharp decrease of the propylene polymerization 
rate occurs (Figure II-51 (A)). Subsequently propylene polymerization resumes 
because allene is consumed in the copolymerization reaction with propylene. The 
restoration is nearly complete, indicating that no irreversible poisoning of the poly-
merization centers takes place but rather that they are blocked from attack of the 
propylene molecule due to the superior coordination power of allene. The degree of 
the activity decrease upon allene admission is proportional to the amount of allene 
introduced into a reaction system [253]; the same phenomenon was described earlier 
for CO, COz, CSz, and acetylene. If one neglects the amount of allene involved in 
copolymerization during the first few minutes after its admission (i.e., if allene is 
regarded as merely a poison) a relationship between the amount of allene introduced 
(Call) and the relative polymerization activity of the remaining centers, kefrlk~ff' can be 
represented by a modified Langmuir equation 

188

(11-47) 
where Co is the concentration of polymerization centers and K is the Langmuir 
adsorption constant. This equation takes into account the distribution of allene 
between the solution and the catalyst surface but it neglects the amount of allene in the 
gas phase. When Call is high (i.e., when kefrlk~ff Â« 1) the equation predicts a linear 
dependence between Call and k~ff/keff' Figure 5l(B) shows experimental data for the 
effect of allene on propylene polymerization (taken from Ref. [253]) in coordinates of 
Eqn. 11-47. A deviation from linearity is obvious: at relatively low allene con-
centrations its adsorption constant K is higher than at the further stage of catalyst 
poisoning. These results are consistent with other data presented in this section: 
polymerization centers of heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts are inhomogeneous 
with respect to their activity. The most active of them (providing more than one-half 
of the total catalyst activity) constitute only ca. 0.1 % of the total Ti content in the 
catalyst [253] which for the (j-TiCl3 . 0.33AlEt3-AlEt2 CI system (So = 22 m2/g) 
corresponds to ca. 3% of the Ti atoms on the catalyst surface. However, another half 
of the catalyst activity is provided by less active centers, accounting for a significant 
portion of the surface transition metal atoms (see further, Section II-6-b). 
Additional information on the concentration of active centers can be extracted 
from data on the reactivation of the catalyst in the process of allene consumption 
(Figure 11-5 1 (AÂ». From the kinetic point of view, this process is a complex copoly-
merization phenomenon (generally described by the set of reactions 1-62) in which the 
concentration of one of the comonomers changes with time and thus prevents the 
application of the steady-state conditions (Eqns. 1-67 and 1-68). According to Ref. 
[253], kinetic analysis of the catalyst reactivation allows an independent estimation of 
Co which for the (j-TiCI3 . AICI3-AlEt3 system constitutes ca. 0.3% of the total 
amount ofTi atoms in the catalyst.

Concentration of Active Centers 
Some data on the relative amounts of the polymerization centers (the ratios between 
Cp and the total amount of transition metal atoms in a catalyst) are collected in 
Tables 11-8-11-10. They are based mainly on studies of catalyst poisoning (by 
alcohols, water, etc.) and on the transfer of radioactive labels from poisons to 
polymer chains. Included also in these tables are some estimates of the Cp/CTi ratios 
based on the values of kp measured from data on the molecular weight increase with 
time (see Section 1-3). 
The following principal conclusions can be made from these data:

II: Chemistry and Functioning of Heterogeneous Catalysts 
(i) Two sets of kinetic data, one based on kp measurements from the molecular 
weight-time dependencies and the second based on estimates of the 
concentration of active centers from poisoning data, are in reasonably good 
agreement. As one example of this agreement, the kp values for propylene 
polymerization at 60-70Â°C with TiCl3-based catalytic systems can be 
considered. According to different authors these estimates are: 
from the Mn vs. t relationships (Section 1-4), kp = 1-7.5 liter/molÂ· s 
from Cp/CTi values (Table 11-9), kp = 0.9-18 liter/molÂ· s 
In the case of ethylene, this comparison is not as good but nevertheless kp 
values estimated by different authors for similar conditions do not differ by 
more than a factor of 5. Taking into account the numerous sources of possible 
experimental and methodological errors encountered by everyone working in 
the field of heterogeneous catalysis, such agreement can be regarded as quite 
good and it gives substantial credit to these kinetic studies. 
(ii) The ratio between the amount of polymerization centers and the total amount 
of transition metal atoms in unsupported heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta 
catalysts, Cp/CTi , is of the order of 5 x 10-3-5 X lO-z, i.e., it is in a range very 
typical for heterogeneous catalysts having a low specific surface area. Deviations 
in both directions exist, of course. Cp/CTi is only 8 x 10-6 for the 6-TiCI3-Et3N 
catalyst which exhibits a very low polymerization activity whereas for some 
supported catalysts for ethylene and propylene polymerization this ratio 
reaches 0.6-0.7. 
Active centers for olefin polymerization in heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta 
catalysts are situated on the catalyst surface, as in all other heterogeneous catalysts. 
The increase of the catalyst surface by grinding, if performed properly and under 
pure conditions, always results in a more or less proportional increase of catalyst 
activity [16, 20, 32, 135, 136, 146, 230]. For this reason commercial catalysts for 
stereospecific polymerization or their supports are usually activated by milling. 
Data on the correlation between catalyst activity for olefin polymerization 
(mainly propylene) and So for different ground TiCl3 samples are presented in Refs. 
[16], [20], [146], and [270]. Reasonably good linear correlations were found between 
these parameters for various ground samples of TiCl3 in combination with AlEt3 
and AlEtzCI at 43Â°C (propylene polymerization in toluene at Al : Ti ratios ~ 1, So 
range 7-55 m2/g)22 [20], for ground IX-TiCI3 with AlEt3 at 50Â°C (propylene 
polymerization in heptane, So range 7-90 mig), [146] (see Table 11-11), and for 
ground IX-TiCI3 and IX-TiCI3Â· 0.33 AICl3 with AlEt2CI at 80Â°C (propylene poly-
merization in xylene, So range 1-32 m2/g) [16] (see Fig. II-52). 
As was discussed in Section II-I-b, the method of So estimation based on X-ray 
data gives substantially higher So values than the BET adsorption method. Analysis 
22 It was shown [20] that when TiCl3 samples are ground in a dry state a substantial agglomeration of 
particles (and an apparent So decrease) takes place when So exceeds 35-40 m2/g. To measure So of these 
samples correctly it is necessary to treat the samples with an inert solvent (heptane, toluene, 20Â°C, 30 
min). This results in the breaking up of particle agglomerates and an increase in the apparent So.

of the experimental data [16, 32, 200] shows that a linear correlation between 
polylrterization activity and S. (X-ray) also exists (see Fig. II-52). The correlation 
between the data of different authors, presented in Fig. II-53, can be regarded as 
good if one takes into account the differences in polymerization temperatures and 
in propylene solubilities in xylene [16] and heptane [32,200]. It should be noted that 
the limit of the TiCl3 grinding level corresponds to S. ~ 50-60 m2 / g when measured 
by the BET method [20] or 300-350 m 2/g when measured by the X-ray method [16]. 
Additional grinding does not increase the specific activity of TiCl3 [20]; it even 
results in its decrease [16] (the "over-milling" effect), possibly due to the b-TiC13 to 
/3-TiCl3 transformation [16]. 
The data presented in Tables 11-8-11-10 give one the possibility to estimate 
semiquantitatively the density of polymerization centers on the catalyst surface. 23

These estimates are given in Tables II-8-I1-10 (fourth columns in Tables I1-8 and II-
9, the fifth column in Table II-lO). They are based on So values measured by the BET 
method. Most of the estimates are given for two types ofTiCl3 : IX-TiCI3 with low So 
and b-TiC1 3 with So ca. 20-22 m 2jg. The IX-TiCI3 crystals do not cleave to any 
significant extent into smaller particles during the polymerization reaction and the 
So values are related to their external surfaces of the crystals. As can be seen from 
these tables, CpjC~irface for these catalysts is in the 0.2-0.5 range, i.e., every second 
to every fifth transition metal atom on the surface is part of a polymerization center. 
The second generally used type of TiCl3 is the b-form, which is activated by 
prolonged dry milling. As was discussed in Section II -I-b, this form usually consists 
of relatively large "secondary" particles formed from dense crystalline "primary" 
particles that are loosely connected by surface forces or, if the b-form is obtained by 
reduction ofTiCl4 with organometallic compounds, by a small amount of polymer 
(polyethylene) formed in the course of the decomposition of the organotitanium 
compounds [18]. These secondary particles usually dissociate into primary particles 
soon after the incidence of polymerization [5, 18,65] due to polymer formation on 
the surfaces of the primary particles. Depending on polymerization conditions, the 
primary particles can be separated one from another [65] or remain bound in single 
large polymer particles which increase in size with time [18]. The last process can be 
visualized as the uniform expansion of secondary particles due to polymer growth, 
which usually results in preservation of the shape of the secondary particles [18]. So 
values typical for b-TiCl3 (20-22 m2 jg) approximately correspond to the surface

199 
area of primary particles (Section II-I-b). When the amount of polymerization 
centers is related to this surface area, the Cp/CWface ratios measured at 50-80Â°C 
usually are in the range 0.1-0.6. i.e., every second to every tenth transition metal 
atom on the catalyst surface is part of an active center. This is qualitatively the same 
situation as for the a-TiCl 3-based catalysts. 
There exists an upper limit of the Cp/Cfrface ratios for these catalysts which is 
lower than 1 and can be estimated approximately as the maximum number of 
isotactic polymer chains which can be placed perpendicular to the catalyst surface, 
provided they form a single crystal over the surface [127]. The cross-section areas for 
polyolefins are: polyethylene, 18.1 A2, isotactic polypropylene, 34.4 A2, poly-1-
butene, 45.3 A 2, poly-4-methyl-I-pentene, 70 A2, polystyrene, 69.2 A 2. If one takes 
into account that the area occupied by a transition metal atom on the surface of 
MCI3 crystals is ca. 16 A2 the upper limit for the Cp/Ct:f'face ratio is: for ethylene 
polymerization, 0.88; for propylene polymerization, 0.46; for I-butene polymeri-
zation, 0.35; for 4-methyl-l-pentene polymerization, 0.23; for styrene polymeriza-
tion, 0.23. 
These estimations are deliberately exagerated. In reality, isotactic polyolefin 
molecules do not grow over the catalyst surface as monolith crystals but form loose 
bundles of crystallites. For this reason, to obtain a more realistic estimation of the 
upper limit for the Cp/Cfyrface ratio these values should be decreased by at least a 
factor of2-3 and cannot exceed 0.3-0.4 for ethylene polymerization and 0.1-0.2 for 
polymerizations of other olefins. These numbers are in reasonably good agreement 
with the experimental estimations of the densities of active centers on the catalyst 
surfaces, as presented in Tables II-8-II-1O. They suggest that the surfaces of 
heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts are covered by polymerization centers rela-
tively densely. 
Some deviations from this situation are apparent from these tables. In the case of 
TiClz, the surface concentration of polymerization centers (ethylene polymeri-
zation at 75Â°C [200]) is significantly lower than for other examples. On the other 
hand, Cp/Cfrface for some t5-TiCI3-based propylene polymerization catalysts is 
substantially higher than the limiting value of 0.5, which suggests that additional 
catalyst dispersion occurs during the course of polymerization. 
In the case of all supported catalysts Cp values are usually higher than those for 
unsupported systems because most ofthe transition metal atoms are situated on the 
catalyst surfaces. The relationship between activity and specific surface area for 
such catalysts is more complex than for unsupported catalysts. In the case of several 
supported catalysts for ethylene polymerization, approximate proportionality be-
tween So and polymer yields has been established [271, 287]. Such catalysts usually 
contain inert supports of high specific surface area (MgO, Alz0 3 , etc.) which are 
structurally incompatible with the crystal lattices of typical solid polymerization 
catalysts (TiCI3 , VCI3 , etc.) (see Section II-I-c). It is believed that these inert 
supports merely provide space on their surface for the formation of small crystallites 
of TiCl3 which serve as the real catalyst precursors [32, 47, 50]. In such cases an 
increase in So of the support translates into an increase in the number of these active 
microcrystallites and in a corresponding increase of ethylene polymerization 
activity. 

200 
II: Chemistry and Functioning of Heterogeneous Catalysts 
Supported catalysts for isospecific olefin polymerization are prepared by pro-
longed ball-milling of MgCl2 in the presence of aromatic acid esters or TiCl4 (see 
Section II -I-c). The milling, apart from rapid increase of the support So to a limit 
value of ca. 150-200 m 2/ g, induces formation of numerous defects on the support 
surface [281, 282]. These defects are thought to be the principal sites of the sub-
sequent interaction with TiCl4 and the formation of isolated or clustered potential 
polymerization centers. As a result, activity of such supported catalysts, though 
being approximately proportional to the catalysts' So, can be predominantly corre-
lated with the degree of crystal disorder in the supports [281, 282]. 
II -6-b. Location of Active Centers on the Catalyst Surface 
As was discussed in Sections II-I-a and II-I-b the crystals of all solid components of 
heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts have two structurally different surfaces: 
basal faces which in initial compounds (TiCI3 , VCI3 , etc.) are covered by halogen 
atoms and which are stripped of these atoms after interaction with organometallic 
compounds (see Section II-2) and lateral faces which initially contain both halogen 
and transition metal atoms.24 The natural question is: where are the polymerization 
centers situated, on the basal or the lateral surfaces of the crystals? 
This question can be answered in a first approximation by the comparison of the 
active center densities (Tables II-8-II-1O] with data on crystal morphology (Sec-
tions II-I-a, b). In the case of un ground oc-TiC13 samples, the area of the basal faces 
roughly corresponds to 90% of the total catalyst surface (see Fig. II-3) and when 
every second to every fifth Ti atom belongs to the centers the largest number of 
centers should be situated on the basal faces on the catalyst. In the case of highly 
ground TiCl3 samples, which usually have the b-structure (Section II-I), the situ-
ation is more complicated. For these powders the areas ofthe basal and the lateral 
faces are approximately equal, judging by microscopic observations (Fig. II-3) and 
X-ray data (Fig. II-6), and the preferential position of the centers becomes uncertain 
[16, 21]. It should be noted also that the precision of the Cp/crrrface estimation is 
insufficient for a definite answer to this question. 
Several attempts were made to observe directly the active centers in the course of 
olefin polymerization [14, 72, 73, 105, 106, 272-274]. These studies did not give an 
equivocal answer either. If olefin polymerization is carried out in the gas phase 
on large leaflets of oc-TiC13 activated by AIMe3 vapor, the initial polymer 
(polypropylene in this case) appears as dots forming regular patterns on the large 
basal planes of the TiCl3 crystals [72, 106, 273]: see Fig. II-54. These patterns 
strongly resemble the growth spirals that are characteristic for many inorganic and 
organic crystals. These growth spirals represent small steps on the basal faces with a 
surface structure similar to that of the lateral faces. For this reason, it was suggested 
[72, 73, 106, 273] that the active centers of olefin polymerization are situated 
primarily on the lateral faces whereas the basal faces are covered by organoalum-
24The lateral faces are at a 62Â° angle to the basal faces in sublimed IX-TiCI3 crystals, which are 
characterized by an especially regular shape [72].

inum complexes that are inactive for olefin polymerization (see Section II-2-a). It is 
surprising, however, that the principal lateral faces of the same crystals (which can 
be clearly seen on Fig. II-54 as very bright and dark areas) are apparently free from 
the polymer. Another important comment about this figure is that it corresponds to 
a very early stage of polymerization (judging by the small amount of polymer 
formed) and that the polymerization was carried out under conditions where a 
significant blockage of polymerization centers by organometallic compounds can 
occur, which is confirmed by the decreased Cp/C~?Tface values for such catalysts (see 
Table II-8). 
Important information concerning the growth of polymer on the catalyst surface 
was presented in Ref. [272]. In this case ethylene polymerization was studied on 
large sublimed IX-TiCl3 crystals that were immersed in concentrated solutions of 
AlEt3 in hexane (CAl::::: 1.6 mol/liter). When ethylene polymerization with this 
catalyst was carried out for a long time, the polymer growth on the large flat basal 
surfaces of IX-TiCl3 was evident (see Fig. II-55) whereas the narrow lateral faces of 
the crystal were free from polymer as in the previous case (Fig. II-54). It should be 
noted that the picture in Fig. II-55 was obtained at low magnification and each 
polymer "ray" visible on the picture has a width at least 1000-2000 A, i.e., it consists 
of at least lOO-300 macromolecules. However, a more detailed study of polyeth-
ylene formation on basal TiCl3 surfaces at higher magnifications (Fig. II-56) revealed 
that the polymer is not formed uniformly but rather along numerous tiny cracks on

the surface which were formed during the course of the preliminary interaction 
between TiCl3 and the concentrated AlEt3 solution. The structure of these "etched" 
TiCl3 areas is unknown but most probably they contain exposed Ti atoms. The data 
presented in Ref. [272] showed also that polymer is formed readily on freshly formed 
TiCl3 surfaces (cleaved edges) and on damaged areas of the surface where it 
produces large nodules resembling enlarged copies of the dots visible in Fig. II-53.

The comparison of the polymer types obtained with this catalyst, the fibrillar 
polymer growing on its lateral faces (Figs. II-55 and II-56) and nodules growing on 
the freshly formed surfaces (mainly lateral), suggests the existence of two popula-
tions of polymerization centers, one very active and producing nodular globules 
and the second less active and producing polymer "rays" over basal TiCl3 faces. It 
should be noted, however, that these experiments were carried out at very high 
AlEt3 concentration; under such conditions typical Ziegler-Natta catalysts exhibit 
strongly reduced activity due to the equilibrium blockage of their centers by AlEt3 
(see Section II-4-d and Fig. II-25). 
Additional information concerning polymer growth on the TiCl3 surface was 
presented in Ref. [254] where the experiments were performed under close to typical 
polymerization conditions. Figure II-57 shows the surface of TiCl3 during the 
earliest stage of ethylene polymerization. Polyethylene nodules are seen uniformly 
covering flat basal surfaces of TiCl3 but leaving lateral faces mainly unaffected. 
Unfortunately, all previous electron microscopic data were obtained at insuffi-

ciently high magnification for a more definite attribution of the location of poly-
merization centers. Attempts to apply this technique at higher resolution [14], 
although highly successful in the study of the smallest TiCl 3 particles and their 
detailed structure (see Section II-I), could not pinpoint the precise location of the 
centers either. 
A comparison of the data presented in Figs. U-55-II-57 indicates that the 
polymerization centers of heterogeneous Ziegler- Natta catalysts are not restricted 
to some specific features of the catalyst surface but can be found everywhere on the 
surface. Their distribution on the faces is not uniform and most probably they are 
situated in chemically damaged areas where organoaluminum compounds etch the

crystal surface, remove the upper chlorine layer from it (possibly several lattice 
layers), and expose inner parts of the crystals to olefins. Chemical reactions respon-
sible for this etching were discussed in Section II-2-b. 
II-6-c. 
Activity of Different Modifications of TiCl3 
Several types ofTiCI3 have been described which differ in their structure (Section II-I-a) and 
chemical composition: ex-TiCI3 , ex-TiCI3 â¢ 0.33 AICI 3 (the product ofTiCI4 reduction with AI), 
f3-TiCI3 (usually contains some amount of Al compounds), y-TiCI3 , y-TiCI3 . nAICI 3 , b-
TiCI3 , and b-TiC13 . nAICI 3 (n = 0.2-0.4, usually 0.33). It is well known that these products, 
when used under the same conditions and in combination with the same organometallic 
compounds, exhibit widely different activities per unit weight of catalyst. As is evident from 
the above discussion, this comparison should take into account significant differences 
between specific surface areas of the compounds. When this is done, the range of catalytic 
activity for different TiCI3 samples partly decreases but the data of different authors still 
remain contradictory [6, 16,20,21, 133]. 
According to Ref. [6] TiCI 3 samples of different origin, when ground in a dry state, exhibit 
similar activity for propylene polymerization, when used in combination with the same 
organoaluminum compounds: see Fig. 1-4 (note that the kerr comparisons take into account 
different monomer concentrations in these tests). The only apparent difference is between Al-
and Si-reduced samples, but even in these cases the difference in kerr is always less than 
twofold and, if polymer yields are compared instead of polymerization rates, the activities are 
very close. The same conclusion was reached when the activities of b-TiCI3 and b-TiCI3 . 0.33 
AICI 3 were compared for these catalysts ground in a wet state (initial samples had the ex-form 
but were transformed into the b-form during grinding) [16]: see Fig. II-52. On the other hand, 
the activity of b-TiCI3 Â· 0.33 AICI 3 ground in a dry state is several times higher than that for 
dry ground b-TiC13 of the same So [16, 21, 133] (see Fig. II-52). 
Such activity comparisons have great importance from the theoretical point of view. Two 
possibilities can be visualized: 
(i) The presence of AICI 3 in the TiCI3 lattice can influence the activity of polymerization 
centers through electronic effects (the amount of AICI3 on the catalyst surface is close to 
the number of polymerization centers). 
(ii) The presence of AICI 3 in TiCI3 crystals can lead to an increase in So. AICI3 easily reacts 
with AlEt3 and AlEt2CI at increased temperatures with the formation of soluble pro-
ducts. This process should lead to an increase in the number of Ti atoms accessible to 
organometallic compounds25 [21]. 
When attempts are made to choose between these two possibilities discrimination between 
two overlapping effects apparent in the experimental data is necessary: 
25 According to Ref. [65] removal of AICI 3 from the TiCI3 . nAICI3 lattice is close to complete and results 
in the disintegration of all catalyst particles into Tis CI24 clusters, each containing two polymerization 
centers. The evident drawback of this hypothesis is that it postulates a very high amount of active centers 
in the catalysts based on TiCI 3 . nAICI3 and hence a very low reactivity of these centers compared with the 
centers formed on usual (X-TiCI 3 crystals which do not contain AICI 3 and do not disintegrate after the 
treatment with organoaluminum compounds but have similar activity to that of the TiCI3 . nAICI3 
samples with the same So [6, 20]. 

206 
II: Chemistry and Functioning of Heterogeneous Catalysts 
(i) Macrokinetic effects. Catalysts of different origin have different rate-time dependencies 
(Section I-I). Clear manifestations of these differences are presented in Fig. 1-4 where 
kinetic data on propylene polymerization are shown for several TiCl3 samples of 
different origin but having similar So (15-21 m2/g) in combination with AIEt3 , AlEt2Cl, 
and AlEt2Br [6]. The TiCl3 sample obtained by reducing TiCl4 with Si with subsequent 
grinding exhibits a stable behavior during 2 h of polymerization independently of Cm. 
On the other hand, TiCl3 samples obtained by reducing TiCl4 with AI or AIEt3 (Le., 
containing AI) with subsequent grinding deactivate with time: they are ca. 2 times more 
active than the first TiCl3 sample initially but ca. 2 times less active than it after 1.5 h. It is 
evident that if polymer yield for a particular polymerization time is used as a measure of 
catalyst activity (as in Fig. II-51) the comparison of different catalysts becomes uncertain 
and the conclusions depend on the polymerization duration. If one takes into account 
that not only total catalyst activity but also the shape of the rate-time dependence 
changes with the catalyst grinding time (the longer the grinding duration, the higher the 
rate of catalyst deactivation with time, see Fig. 1-14) the problems involved in choosing 
an activity parameter which can be used to compare different TiCl3 samples becomes 
evident.26 The best parameters for such comparison would be kp and Co/CTiCh ' So 
estimated by using the same experimental technique. 
(ii) The "real" catalyst surface area. As was discussed in Section II-l-b, the two methods of So 
measurement (BET and X-ray methods) usually give substantially different estimations. 
Several circumstances should be taken into account in this connection. The BET method 
gives the correct So values for initial TiCl3 samples (the surface accessible by N2 
molecules) whereas it does not take into account internal lattice dislocations and crystal 
voids which the X-ray method "sees." The treatment ofTiCl3 crystals with organometal-
lic compounds results in a significant modification of the crystal surface (Figs. II-55, 11-
56) and it can lead to an increase in So due to crystal splitting, especially for highly ground 
powders with a large number of cracks. Additional crystal splitting is induced by a 
polymer growing on the crystal surface. The degree of this So increase is not known but 
one can assume that it is proportional to the initial So, which explains the correlations 
between catalyst activity and initial So in Fig. II-52. 
The data presented in Table 11-2 show that a change in the grinding procedure results in a 
change of s;oray/s:ET which can be explained by the different mechanisms of the "dry" and 
"wet" grinding procedures. When the grinding is carried out in a solvent, the solvent prevents 
the agglomeration of the newly formed crystallites. A similar effect was found when ground 
TiCl3 samples were treated with a solvent after milling. This increased their So substantially 
[20]. For such TiCl3 samples S:ET is apparently a good estimation of the "real" catalyst 
surface area. It should be remembered, however, that S;oray/s:ET for the wet-ground 
TiCl3 . 0.33 AICl3 samples is still close to 3 (Table 11-2), which means that numerous voids 
and dislocations are present in the samples that are still inaccessible by N 2 â¢ There is virtually 
no information as to whether these defects are opened in the course of the crystal treatment 
with organometallic compounds and olefin polymerization or to what extent. If this ad-
ditional breaking-up of agglomerates really takes place effective Cp/c~~rface values presented 
in Tables 11-8-11-10 should be decreased by a factor of ca. 2.5-3. 
If the TiCl3 grinding is carried out in a dry state the results depend on the TiCl3 structure. 
When an oc-TiC13 sample was ground in this way s;oraY/S:ET for the sample (3.8, Table 11-2) 
26The application of Rmax for this purpose (see Fig. 1-1, for example), as is done in Ref. [21], is not 
justified either because this value varies in a complex way with many polymerization parameters (see 
Eqn. 1-38) and it is by no means a direct measure of kp or Co. 

II-7: Origins of Catalyst Instability 
207 
was still close to the ratio typical for the wet-ground samples, suggesting the same level of 
crystal imperfection. Correspondingly, the activity versus So relationship for this sample 
coincides with that for wet-milled catalysts. On the other hand, when different a-TiCI3 Â· 0.33 
AlCl3 samples were ground in a dry state the resulting s;-raY/S:ET values are much higher 
(7-8, Table II-2). It can be suggested that when these samples are immersed in an inert solvent 
at the outset of polymerization, some of the agglomerated crystals are dispersed and the 
"real" So is increased compared to the estimates made for the initial samples. If this 
suggestion is valid, the BET method substantially underestimates the "real" So values for 
such crystals and if a correction is made for this underestimation, the experimental points for 
the TiCl3 . 0.33 AlCl3 samples ground in a dry state in Fig. II-52 should be shifted to the right 
side, thus decreasing the differences between the activities of the different TiCl3 samples. This 
conclusion is in accord with the experimental data [20]: the correlations between activity and 
"corrected" So are very close for different TiCl3 samples, both those containing AlCl3 and 
those free of it. 
The previous discussion indicated that a comparison of "true" polymerization activity for 
different TiCl3 samples requires a very careful account of all variables involved. This problem 
is not completely resolved yet but the discussion of the data presented in Figs. II-52 and II-53 
as well as the data presented in Ref. [20] suggest that the principal parameter determining the 
catalyst activity ofTiCl3 is its So. The presence of AlCl3 in its structure influences primarily its 
chemical and morphological properties-increasing its activity in reactions with organome-
tallic compounds and enhancing the tendency of its crystals to break during this interaction and 
during crystal grinding-rather than the "true" activity of its polymerization centers. 
n -7. 
Origins of Catalyst Instability 
All heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts used for olefin polymerization can be 
roughly subdivided into two categories with respect to their stability: (a) stable, e.g., 
exhibiting a nearly constant activity for many hours of polymerization, and (b) 
unstable, the rate of polymerization with which falls, sometimes dramatically, 
during the first 1-2 h of the reaction. Many examples of both types of such catalysts 
have been discussed in Chapters I and II. It is not easy to point out any particular 
features of catalyst structures which make them stable or unstable or to find a 
correlation between the stability of a catalyst and its chemical or structural 
characteristics: 
(i) Unground samples of a-TiC1 3 with low So exhibit stable behavior after an 
initial acceleration stage (see Section 1-2-b) or immediately after the beginning 
of polymerization in an overwhelming number of cases; see Fig. 1-2. However, 
the same samples sometimes become unstable even after a short period of 
grinding [122,144, 192]. 
(ii) Samples of b-TiC1 3 . nAlC13 (n = 0.2-0.4), typical second generation catalysts, 
are unstable in a majority of cases. The presence of AlC13 is one of the principal 
features of kinetically unstable catalysts [275]. Nevertheless, some examples 
were presented (e.g., in Refs. [194] and [230]) where these catalysts demon-
strated a fairly stable behavior for ca. 2 h in ethylene, propylene, and I-butene 

208 
II: Chemistry and Functioning of Heterogeneous Catalysts 
polymerization at 60-75Â°C in the presence of AlEt3 and AlEt2Cl. These 
catalysts are usually stable at low temperatures (20-30Â°C) [148, 260]. 
(iii) Unground samples of VCl3 can exhibit both very stable and unstable poly-
merization kinetics, depending on the Al : V ratio [123, 276]. 
(iv) Supported Ti-containing catalysts are usually unstable [7, 209, 261, 283, 284] 
but in several examples these catalysts remain very active and stable in ethyl-
ene, propylene, and 4-methyl-I-pentene polymerization, even in combination 
with AlEt3 [46, 230, 265]. 
From the quantitative point of view, the kinetic behavior of Ziegler-Natta 
catalysts can be described by Scheme 1-35, as discussed in Section 1-2-c, and Eqn. 1-
38, or, if the acceleration process is sufficiently fast, by Eqn. 1-39. In this equation 
the total amount of polymerization centers in a catalytic system is divided into two 
parts, stable centers (Co, 1) and unstable centers (Co, 2)' 
The principal problem is: what are the particular reasons for the instability of 
catalysts with time? What features of a catalyst determine the Co, 1/( Co, 1 + Co,2) 
ratio (the level of catalytic activity after completion of the deceleration reaction) and 
the value of the catalyst deactivation constant kd (see reaction scheme 1-35)? 
Attempts to explain the catalyst deactivation phenomenon usually follow three 
main lines of argument: 
(i) Diffusion retardation of the polymerization process. 
(ii) Reactions of polymerization centers with impurities or components of the 
polymerization medium. 
(iii) Intrinsic instability of some part of the polymerization centers. 
Diffusion explanations for catalyst deactivation are usually proposed when 
highly active catalysts are examined that produce large volumes of polymer in a 
short time provided the monomer supply to the polymerization system is not 
restricted. This possibility was discussed previously (see Introduction to Chapter II) 
and it was demonstrated that neither experimental data nor calculations of diffusion 
kinetics confirm this effect as a universal explanation for catalyst deactivation. It is 
pertinent to repeat here some principal kinetic evidence against this explanation (for 
more details see Refs. [2] and [153]): 
(i) The reaction of catalyst deactivation does not depend on the amount of 
polymer formed. Kinetic curves for propylene polymerization with the 0-
TiCI3-AlEt2CI system, in coordinates keff versus time, are independent of the 
monomer concentration and hence of the amount of polymer, which can differ 
by as much as a factor of lO for the same polymerization duration in different 
runs [6] (see Fig. 1-4). 
(ii) When polymerization experiments are carried out with aged catalysts, the 
catalyst deactivation phenomena in many cases do not depend on the duration 
of aging [20, 122, 152, 280], i.e., catalyst activity decreases independently of the 
polymerization reaction. 
(iii) Similar deactivation phenomena are demonstrated sometimes by catalysts with 

11-7: Origins of Catalyst Instability 
209 
very different levels of activity, i.e., the c5-TiCI3-AlEt3 and c5-TiCI3-AlEt2Cl 
systems [6]; see Fig. 1-4. In other cases catalysts with different activities exhibit 
stable behavior regardless of the amount of polymer formed [230]. 
(iv) The estimation of the Thiele modulus for the majority of ethylene and pro-
pylene polymerization reactions shows that the modulus is significantly lower 
(1.5-4.3 x 10-2) than the value that corresponds to the transition from kinetic 
to diffusion control [2]. 
The role of different organometallic compounds as deactivators of hetero-
geneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts was discussed in Section 11-4-b. Two different 
effects were examined in the literature. One is the reversible deactivation of poly-
merization centers byAlEtCl2 , the product ofthe interaction between AlEt2Cl and 
AICI3, which is present in many highly active compositions based on TiCl3 [128, 
153]. This explanation is supported by independent data on the catalytic activity of 
tertiary TiCI3-AlEt2CI-AlEtCI2 systems (Section 11-4-e). When AICl3 is absent 
from the solid component (e.g., ('/.-TiCI3, VCI3) the amount of AlEtCl2 formed in the 
reaction between MCl3 and AlEt2Cl is small and these catalysts are usually stable 
over a wide temperature range. 
When AlEt3 is used as a co-catalyst in combination with many transition metal 
halides, one of the principal reasons for catalyst deactivation is the irreversible 
destruction of polymerization centers due to their reduction. This effect is well-
pronounced in the case of highly active c5-TiC13-AlEt3 systems (Figs. 1-19, 11-14), 
VCI3-Ali-Bu3 systems (Fig. 11-15), and supported TiCI4/MgCI2-AlEt3 catalysts, 
especially at high temperature [50, 127]. It should be noted that these irreversible 
reactions exhibit different kinetic behavior: in the case of the TiC13-AlEt3 systems 
the rate constants for catalyst deactivation, kd' do not depend on the AlEt3 con-
centration in solution [20, 122, 277] (a reaction with adsorbed AlEt3 can be sug-
gested), whereas in the case of the V03-Ali-Bu3 system, kd is proportional to the 
Ali-Bu3 concentration in solution [276, 278]. 
As was discussed in Section 1-2-c and in the beginning of this section, the catalyst 
deactivation reaction can be described kinetically as a first-order process including 
some part Co,2/(Co,l + Co,2) of all active centers. It should be remembered, how-
ever, that this approach to the description of catalyst behavior is very formal and it 
hardly can be used for the study of the true deactivation mechanism. 
The deactivation reaction is evidently a complex topochemical process that 
includes several stages (i.e., alkylation, the formation of complexes with organome-
tallic compounds present in the system, dealkylation) which are superimposed on a 
polymerization reaction. Any attempt to describe these processes by a simple kinetic 
law would be an oversimplification. Similarly formal is the division of all polymeri-
zation centers into two distinct types, stable and unstable, the first accounting for 
the polymerization at the final stage of the catalyst "life" and the second disappearing 
from the system completely. This division cannot be due to some intrinsic feature of 
a particular catalyst but rather it is a result of all conditions under which polymeri-
zation centers are formed: the type of organometallic compound, its concentration 
in the system, temperature, the concentration of defects in the solid catalyst, etc. 
The following qualitative picture can be visualized. The higher the alkylating and 

210

reducing ability of an organometallic compound (i.e., AlEt3 vs. AlEt2Cl) the higher 
is the concentration of the polymerization centers it can produce (see Section II-2) 
due to modification of the crystal lattice. This modification is especially facilitated 
when AICl3 is present in the solid catalyst component. However, a significant part 
of the centers are situated in an environment full of defects and they are especially 
prone to destruction, either through interaction with organometallic compounds 
or through monomolecular reactions. The centers are not homogeneous either with 
respect to their activity or their stereospecificity (see Chapter IV), and in the case of 
organometallic compounds of high alkylating power this distribution of activities is 
wider.

Monomer Coordination Stage: Its Chemical and Kinetic 
Manifestations 
Early in the study of heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts the "coordination-
anionic" mechanism for olefin polymerization with these catalysts was proposed 
[77]. According to this mechanism the addition of monomer to a polymer chain 
consists of two consecutive steps: 
(i) The coordination of an olefin molecule with the transition metal atom of a 
polymerization center, i.e.,complex formation. 
(ii) The insertion of the olefin molecule between the metal atom and the growing 
polymer chain 
/C 
k'" 
Cat-Polymer (v) + C=C ~ Cat-Polymer (v) ----+ Cat-Polymer (v + 1) 
/C' 
â¢ 
(II-48) 
The existence of the first stage was postulated on the grounds of a well-known 
phenomenon, the reversible formation of n-complexes between olefins and tran-
sition metal ions, whereas the second stage, the irreversible olefin insertion, has a 
well-documented analogue, ethylene insertion into AI-C and Mg-C bonds (see 
reviews of these reactions in Refs. [177] and [206]). This mechanism is discussed in 
detail in Chapter V. The main subject ofthis section is the kinetic implications of this 
mechanism. 
The polymerization scheme II-48 can be compared with the thoroughly studied 
reaction of CO insertion into the Mn-C bond in the following reaction [237-239] 
(II-49) 
The application of labeled CO in this reaction showed that the insertion stage 
included an already coordinated CO molecule rather than the attacking CO 
molecule 

11-8: Monomer Coordination Stage: Its Chemical and Kinetic Manifestations 
211 
(II-50) 
A nucleophile, the attacking CO molecule, plays an important role in the reaction 
when the solvating power of the solvent is low [238], the same situation as in typical 
olefin polymerizations with Ziegler-Natta catalysts. The carbonylation reaction II-
50 differs, however, from the olefin polymerization reaction II-48 in two significant 
ways. Here the insertion stage is reversible but the coordination stage is irreversible. 
The expression for olefin consumption (i.e., for the polymerization rate) for 
Scheme II-48 (assuming that Cat-Polymer (v) and Cat-Polymer (v + 1) are kineti-
cally indistinguishable and [Cat-Polymer (v)] + [Cat-Polymer (v + 1)] = Cp ) [154, 
202, 279] is: 
/ck"'C 
R = CPk'Cm + kIf: /C", 
(II-51) 
i.e., this is the standard equation for the Michaelis-Menten reaction. It can be 
rewritten as 
k"'C 
R = CpC 
m 
m+ K 
kIf + /C" 
with K= 
k' 
(II-52) 
Three variants of the relationship between the rate constants in Eqns. II-51 and 
II-52 are usually considered [2, 154,202]: 
(i) /C Cm Â» kIf + k"'; strong coordination of a monomer on a polymerization cen-
ter. In such a case the rate of polymerization would be independent of Cm, 
which contradicts experimental findings (see Sections I-I and 1-2). 
(ii) /C'Â» /C Cm: very weak monomer coordination. In this case 
k'/C"C 
C C /C" 
R-C 
m= pm 
-
Pk"+k'"

(II-53) 
i.e., a first-order dependence of Ron Cm is maintained for all concentrations, in 
accordance with experimental data, and the effective rate constant keff is /C" /K, 
i.e., it depends on the characteristics of both coordination and insertion stages. 
(iii) /C"Â» /C Cm and /C" Â» kIf; a very fast insertion stage. In this case 
(II-54) 
e.g., the polymerization reaction has a limiting stage of monomer coordination 
and also exhibits first-order kinetics with respect to Cm. In addition, keff = k'. 
If the olefin polymerization reaction is described as a heterogeneous catalytic 
reaction, the same dependencies II-51-II-54 are applicable after the following 

212 
II: Chemistry and Functioning of Heterogeneous Catalysts 
substitution of definitions: "adsorption" instead of "coordination", "adsorption 
rate constant" instead of "coordination rate constant", k', and "desorption rate 
constant" instead of "dissociation rate constant", k". For example, one of the 
standard schemes of catalytic polymerization examined in the literature is equiva-
lent to reaction scheme II-48. 
Polymerization center + Monomer tdsorptio~ Monomer complex Polymerizatio~ 
Polymerization center 
Two other catalytic schemes usually discussed [21] are the Rideal mechanism, 
which involves a direct reaction between a monomer molecule and an organometal-
lic compound adsorbed on the catalyst surface, and the Langmuir-Hinshelwood 
mechanism, which involves an interaction between a monomer and an organome-
tallic compound, both molecules being adsorbed on the catalyst surface. It is 
assumed in both mechanisms that monomer adsorption is very weak. This results in 
a first-order dependence of Ron Cm, the same as in the just discussed variant (ii). 
The Rideal kinetic scheme can be used for the description of the dependence of 
the polymerization rate on the concentration of an organometallic compound. This 
depenpence is discussed in Section II-4-d. It was demonstrated [21] that the 
Langmuir-Hinshelwood adsorption scheme is inapplicable to the description of the 
olefin polymerization reaction from the point of view of the statistical mechanical 
theory of stationary polymerization. 
Most experimental evidence that the coordination stage is the first stage of the 
olefin polymerization reaction comes from the study of catalyst poisoning (see 
Section II-S-h). Several catalytic poisons were found which can adsorb on poly-
merization centers and halt olefin polymerization. This adsorption is an equilibrium 
process and it does not alter or damage the centers. The removal of these poisons 
from polymerization centers can be nearly complete and it results in the restoration 
of the polymerization activity (Fig. II-4S). The data on acetylene and allene inhi-
bition of olefin polymerization are especially instructive. These monomers not only 
effectively block the access of olefins to the polymerization centers but they incorpo-
rate into polymer chains, i.e., they most probably coordinate with a transition metal 
atom of a polymerization center in the same manner as olefin molecules do (see 
Chapter V). 
It is evident from the previous discussion that two variants of Scheme II-48 
satisfy the experimental data on olefin polymerization (the first-order dependence 
will respect to Cm): variant (ii) corresponding to weak monomer coordination and 
variant (iii) corresponding to a fast insertion stage independent of the characteristics 
of the coordination stage. Experimental data allowing discrimination between these 
two possibilities are not conclusive. As was discussed in Section I-S-b, the data on 
homopolymerization and copolymerization of substituted styrenes [279] indicate 
that the coordination step is the controlling stage of Reaction II-48. However, 
quantitative analysis of the data on olefin copolymerization (Section I -S-b) demon-
strated the influence of the structure of the last monomer unit in the polymer chain 
on the rates of the copolymerization reactions, thus indicating the significance of the 
second step in Reaction II-48 (the insertion reaction) in the overall kinetics. Some

data about the relative influence of both these steps on the process of monomer 
addition to a polyolefin chain will be discussed later in Section III-8.

Chapter III 
Stereospecificity of Heterogeneous 
Ziegler-N atta Catalysts 
Introduction 
The most prominent feature of heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts is their 
ability to produce isotactic olefin polymers exhibiting a combination of outstanding 
mechanical characteristics. This ability adds a new dimension to the description of 
the catalysts and the polymerization processes: the study of catalyst and polymeri-
zation parameters influencing polyolefin stereo regularity . Such studies usually pur-
sue two goals: improvement of catalyst isospecificity and understanding of the 
mechanism of isotactic polymer formation. It is the second topic that constitutes the 
main subject of this chapter. 
The theory of polymer stereoregularity was developed in the classical works of 
Natta and his coworkers and, as such, has no intrinsic relation to Ziegler-Natta 
catalysts apart from the fact that all isotactic polyolefins can be obtained with them. 
The main principles of stereoregularity have been presented in many books and 
reviews (see Introduction in this book). For this reason only a few essential defi-
nitions are given below. 
Stereo regularity in effect is the existence of some order in the spatial structure of 
a polymer- chain. This ordered spatial structure is determined by two phenomena. 
First, during the polymer synthesis monomer units are linked with each other in a 
chain in some definite manner which depends on the properties of the catalyst or on 
polymerization conditions. Second, this regularly built polymer chain sponta-
neously arranges itself in some spatially ordered form (usually in a helix form). 
Regularity of the first type (the regularity of the monomer unit linking) arises 
during macromolecule synthesis and cannot be altered or changed during subse-
quent physical transformations of a polymer. 
If one draws a polymer chain with its backbone in a flat zigzag form (see Fig. 
III -1) two regular substituent patterns are easily envisaged in the case of monosub-
stituted vinyl units:

Figure III-I. Representations of chains of polY-IX-olefins in the flat zigzag conformation. (I) 
isotactic, (II) syndiotactic, (III) atactic. 
(i) All substituents R uniformly lie on one side of the zigzag plane (above or below 
it); such polymers are named isotactic. 
(ii) The substituents R alternatively occupy positions above and below the back-
bone plane; such polymers are named syndiotactic. 
(iii) If no regular pattern exists in the arrangement of substituents the polymer is 
said to be atactic. 
When one deals with imperfectly stereoregular polymers (and most polyolefins 
obtained with Ziegler-Natta catalysts are imperfect in a steric sense) the problem of 
a simple and convenient stereostructure nomenclature is very important. Whereas 
the structural description of low molecular weight compounds with asymmetric 
carbon atoms is explicit and minutely regulated no similarly universal rules for 
polymer description as yet exist. Strictly speaking, tertiary carbon atoms in 
polyolefih chains are not asymmetric in a general chemical sense because two of 
their substituents are similarly built, practically infinite polymer sequences (these 
atoms are often called "pseudo-asymmetric"). For this reason generally accepted 
symbols of asymmetric carbon atoms (R and S) can not be applied here. What 
matters in the polyolefin chain structure is the relative position of the nearest 
substituents with respect to the monomer unit under consideration. We may choose 

III -1: Chemistry of Olefin Polymerization 
223 
the symbols D and L to designate two possible configurations of tertiary carbon 
atoms in poly olefin chains (or the positions of the substituents R with respect to 
each other). It is necessary to stress that no particular meaning is connected with this 
designation other than the possibility to distinguish between similarly situated 
substituents: 
DDDDDDD or LLLLLLLL-isotactic sequences, 
alternately situated substituents: 
DLDLDLDLDL-the syndiotactic sequence, 
or randomly situated substituents: 
DLDDLDLLLDLLLLDDLDDLL-an example of the atactic sequence. 
Regularity of the second type (the regularity of the polymer chain spatial 
structure) is determined by the kind of regularity in the mOnomer unit linking. The 
flat spatial structure of an isotactic polymer presented in Fig. III-I is entirely 
imaginary. In reality the chain nearly never adopts this extended form but is coiled 
in a helix. The form of the helix depends mainly on the substituent R. Usually, for a 
given R only one helical form is stable but sometimes different types of helices can 
be formed depending On melt crystallization conditions (for example in the case of 
isotactic poly-I-butene). The main types of polyolefin helices are presented in Fig. 
III-2. These helical structures exist below the polymer melting temperature, both in 
the crystalline state and in solution at low temperatures. In the melt state, helical 
structures also exist but they are of short length and are connected by chain 
segments of irregular conformation. Polymer chains in a helix conformation easily 
form three-dimensional regular conglomerates (crystals). 
The principal subject of this chapter is the discussion of the factors determining 
the isotacticity of polymer chains produced by different heterogeneous 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts.

Normal Reaction Pattern 
As can be seen from Fig. III-I the regular "head-to-tail" chemical structure of a 
polymer chain is a necessary prerequisite for polymer stereoregularity. Indeed, it 
has been demonstrated that olefin polymerization with heterogeneous catalysts 
proceeds in a regular "head-to-tail" fashion. The end-group of the growing chain 
is CH2 (the "coordination-anionic" mechanism, see Chapter V) which results in 
vinylidene group formation at the end of a polymer chain after some termination

investigations concerning the structure of polypropylene saturated end-groups [2].

This reaction results in metal-allyl compound formation. The new active center 
produces polypropylene containing vinyl end-groups. In the vast majority of cases 
all these reactions proceed without isomerization of the substituent R. This fact, now 

226 
III: Stereospecificity of Heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta Catalysts 
generally being regarded as trivial, has been proved many times, mainly by IR and 
NMR methods. 
The chemical structure of isotactic and atactic polypropylene has been confirmed 
in Ref. [4]. The absence of isomerization of the substituent R has been demonstrated 
for poly-I-pentene [5], poly-3-methyl-l-butene, 1 etc. 
The presence ofvinylidene double bonds at the ends of poly olefin chains has been 
also demonstrated in the case of polypropylene [1], poly-l-pentene [5], and poly-l-
octene [7]. The isomerization of substituents R takes place only when they contain a 
double bond (see Section III-I-c). 
llI-l-b. Monomer Unit Inversion 
One of the important chemical deviations from a regular olefin polymerization 
pattern is a "head-to-head" addition of monomer units:

This phenomenon has been carefully studied by IR and NMR methods in the case 
of polypropylene. The formation of the CHz-CHz sequences in polypropylene 
chains can be identified by the appearance of the 750 cm -1 band in the IR spectra 
of polymers and the formation of CH (CH 3)-CH(CH3 ) sequences by the ap-
pearance of the 1120-1130 cm -1 band [8, 9]. Table 111-1 contains data on the "head-
to-head" unit content in different polypropylene samples. The value presented is 
the percentage of "inverted" monomer units in a polymer. 
Apparent differences in the estimation of inverted unit amounts for polypropyl-
ene samples obtained with the same catalytic systems are partly related to differ-
ences in the extinction coefficient value for the 750 cm -1 band for different model 
compounds and polymers [23-26].z It follows from Table 111-1 that most typical

low temperatures is accompanied by a rapid isomerization reaction with the formation of -CH2-
CH 2-C(CH 3)2- units [6].

III: Stereospecificity of Heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta Catalysts 
heterogeneous catalysts for olefin polymerization based on TiCl3 and VCl3 are 
characterized by very low, or zero, incidence of monomer unit inversion in the 
course of polymer chain growth and the polymers formed on them can be, in good 
approximation, regarded as chemically pure "head-to-tail" products. 
On the other hand, catalytic centers existing in VCI4 - and VOCl3-based systems 
are characterized by a significant ability to invert propylene units. The same is true 
also in the case of poly-4-methyl-l-pentene obtained with the VOCl3-based catalyst 
(the 750 cm -1 band oflow intensity in present in the IR spectrum). This relatively 
high occurrence of monomer inversion in the case of polyolefins obtained with some 
V-containing catalysts was related to a specific mode of propagation: secondary 
monomer insertion into the V-C bond [20, 27, 28]. The detailed assignment of 
13C-NMR signals for inverted units in polypropylene is given in Ref. [29]. 
III-I-c. Monomer Isomerization 
Two different isomerization processes are characteristic for many heterogeneous 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts. The first process is the isomerization of the substituent R in 
the case when it contains a vinyl double bond. For example, in the course of the 
polymerization of nonconjugated dienes CH2=CH-(CH2)n-CH=CH2' when 
the first double bond takes part in polymerization the second double bond can easily 
react with the same active center to form a ring [30, 31]: 
A highly cyc1ized polymer of 1 ,5-hexadiene (n = 2) is a crystalline polymer with the 
flat zigzag conformation and with a melting point of 140-146Â°C. When this 
monomer was polymerized with the catalytic system TiC14-AlEt3 at 80Â°C the 
cyc1ization reaction was not complete; for the poorly soluble fraction the cyclization 
degree was 75% and for the easily soluble fraction, ca. 50%. Although this cyc1iza-
tion reaction can formally be regarded as an isomerization polymerization process, 
it is in effect a specific copolymerization reaction. 
On the other hand, typical heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts contain some 
species which easily isomerize olefins. Different types of isomerization processes 
were discovered: 
(i) Cis-trans isomerication (in the case of cis-CHD=CHD, [32]). It takes place 
with the TiC14-AlEt3 system at high Al : Ti ratios independently of the poly-
merization process and the trans-CHD=CHD formed copolymerizes with the 
original cis-CHD=CHD. 
(ii) Isomerization of j3-olefins to a-olefins. This reaction is responsible for the 

111-2: Methods of Measurement of Poly olefin Stereoregularity 
229 
polymerization of p-olefins into regular polY-I>:-olefins. According to data 
presented in Refs. [33]-[38] such olefins as 2-butene, 2-pentene, 2-hexene, and 
2-octene first independently isomerize to an equilibrium mixture of 1>:- and P-
olefins and then these I>:-olefins polymerize in a standard manner to yield 
isotactic polymers. The identification of olefin types in the polymerization 
solution showed that the two processes involved, those of isomerization and 
polymerization, are not synchronous and are probably performed by different 
catalytic species [37]. A similar double bond shift reaction is responsible for the 
migration of the double bond during 1,5-heptadiene polymerization [39]: 
........ 
......... 
/CH-CH 2-CH 2-CH=CH-CH3 -> /CH-CHz-CHz-CH 2-CH=CH 2 
(iii) Isomerization of I>:-olefins to p-olefins. This type of isomerization is especially 
pronounced in the case of vinyIcyclohexane polymerization [40]. This mono-
mer easily isomerizes to a mixture of ethylidenecyclohexane, l-ethyl-, 3-ethyl-, 
and 4-ethyIcyclohexenes, which prevents complete conversion of vinyIcyclo-
hexane to a polymer even at high polymerization duration. The limiting values 
for conversion to polymer at 80Â°C are [40]: 70% for the I>:-TiCI3-Ali-Bu3 
system, 55% for the TiCIcAlEt3 system, 50% for the TiCI4-Ali-Bu3 system, 
and 10% for the TiCIc AlEt2Cl system. A similar shift ~H-CH2-CH2-
CH-CH2 -+ .)cH-CH2-CH=CH-CH3, was found in 1,5-hexadiene 
polymerization [31]. 
One of the most probable sources of the isomerization activity in both P -+ I>: and 
I>: -+ P isomerization is TiCl3 itself which easily isomerizes pure cis-2-butene, trans-2-
butene, and I-butene to their equilibrium mixture [35] and l-octadecene to trans-2-
octadecene [7,33]. Other sources of isomerization activity are unidentified products 
of the interactions of catalyst component. The most probable isomerization mech-
anism involves n-complex formation between olefin and a transition metal atom 
with subsequent double bond migration by n-allylic or t:5-alkyl mechanisms [41].

11I-2-a. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. Sequence Classification 
The importance of NMR methods as absolute methods for the study of polymer 
configuration and as precise quantitative methods for the measurement of polymer 
stereoregularity cannot be overestimated. Nowadays NMR methods enjoy absolute 
acceptance as the principal theoretically proven methods used for the study of 
different aspects of vinyl polymer regularity and monomer unit distribution in 
copolymers. Exhaustive reviews of this subject [42-44] make it unnecessary to 
describe here the basic principles of the correlation between polymer configuration

III: Stereospecificity of Heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta Catalysts 
and the number and position of peaks for different hydrogen (in 1 H-NMR spectra) 
or carbon (in 13C-NMR spectra) atoms of a polymer chain. 
Wide application of NMR methods to steric structure characterization of vinyl 
polymers gave rise to a specific classification of monomer sequences in polymer 
chains. This classification is based on the characteristic features of any polymer 
NMR spectrum: the chemical shift (and, in the case of lH-NMR spectra, multipli-
city) of the signal belonging to some particular chemical group in a polymer chain 
depends on the arrangement, structure, and symmetry of neighboring chemical 
groups [42-44]. When one examines the CH2 group signal of a polyolefin chain 
consisting of regular "head-to-tail" linked monomers two different situations can 
exist regarding the positions of the closest neighbor groups: 
(i) this CH2 group belongs to the monomer unit isotactically connected to the 
previous unit: 
.... (CH2-CH-)-CH2-CH- .... 
/

i

R

Such a configuration can be designated as a DD (or LL) sequence if one applies 
the classification described in the introduction to this chapter or, according to 
Ref. [42], it can be designated as a meso-dyad (symbol m) if one adopts the 
classification used for 2,4-disubstituted pentanes. 
(ii) this CH2 group belongs to the monomer unit syndiotactically linked to the 
previous unit:

This configuration is defined as a D L (or LD) sequence or, following Ref. [42], a 
racemic dyad (symbol r). 
When one examines the CH group signal or the signals belonging to the atoms in 
the R group in the polymer chains three different situations can exist: (the group 
considered is in the center of the sequences): 
(i) -CH2-CH -CH2-CH -CH2-CH -, an isotactic triad, DDD (or LLL);

The NMR spectra of most poly ole fins are sensitive not only to the configuration of 
the closest neighbor units, as shown previously, but also to the configuration of 
more remote units. The classification of these longer sequences is based on the same 
principles and is presented in Table III-2. 
The best example of the significance of NMR methods for the determination of 
absolute configuration in the case of polyolefins is the study of the high-resolution 
IH-NMR spectra of different products of deuterated propylene polymerization 
[45]. 
In the case of syndiotactic polymer both protons of the CH2 groups (marked by 
asterisks) are in nearly equivalent positions with respect to all other groups in the 
polymer chain and their signal is a singlet in the 1 H -NMR spectra due to the virtual 
absence of any splitting by neighboring deuterium atoms (in usual polypropylene 
spectra this signal is a triplet due to splitting by neighboring CH protons). On the 
other hand, the same marked protons in the isotactic chain are evidently nonequiva-
lent which results in their complex splitting-see Fig. III-3. The same results were 
obtained in the study of the IH-NMR spectra of isotactic and syndiotactic poly-
2,3,3,3-propylene-d4 [46]. This NMR study of the propylene polymers obtained 
with heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts indisputably confirmed the isotactic 
nature of the products formed (the first definite proof of the structure was obtained

The following is a short review of NMR methods used for polyolefin stereore-
gularity measurements. 
Polypropylene IH-NMR Spectra. 
Significant efforts have been undertaken to assign 
the IH-NMR spectra of polypropylene. Two effects made this assignment difficult: strong 
interaction between protons of CH and methyl groups and small difference between the

chemical shifts ofCH, CHz, and CH 3 protons [42-44]. Nevertheless, the application of high-
resolution spectroscopy enables one to separate the signals of different groups [42, 47]-see 
Fig. III -4. The spectrum of the syndiotactic polymer is relatively simple and consists of the 
CH3 doublet (splitting by CH protons), the CHz triplet (both protons of this group are in a 
similar arrangement and the chemical shifts of their signals coincide; splitting by CH 
protons), and the CH multiplet. The spectrum of isotactic polypropylene in Fig. 111-4 is more 
complex. It consists of the CH3 doublet with a chemical shift different from that of the 
syndiotactic polymer, the CH multiplet approximately in the same place as in the syndiotactic 
polymer spectrum, and two CHz multiplets-one (clearly visible in the spectrum) at 'C = 
8.739 ppm [48] and the second one strongly overlapped with the CH3 signal at 'C = 9.135 
ppm [48]. The separation of the two CHz proton signals is due to their different shielding by 
neighboring groups. The spectra of stereoirregular polypropylene samples are very complex 
[49] (see Fig. 111-5) and consist of many strongly overlapped signals belonging to different

stereosequences. Theoretical interpretation of these spectra as well as those of partially 
deuterated samples of atactic polymers [48, 49] was discussed in Refs. [50] and [51]. This 
analysis revealed the presence of all possible CH 2 tetrad configurations in these polymers. 
Contradictory conclusions were derived from the analysis of the IH-NMR spectra of 
predominantly isotactic polypropylene samples containing small amounts of stereo-defects. 
The low intensity of the signals of these stereoirregular sequences, their complex shape, and 
controversy in the theoretical prediction of their positions all resulted in a strenuous dis-
cussion which continued for many years and strongly influenced current ideas on the 
mechanism of isospecific center functioning [42, 48, 50-55]. The most significant break-
through in this problem was reached in Ref. [56]. The comparison of the spectra of nascent 
and epimerized polypropylene samples as well as the thorough study of the NMR spectra of 
trans-CD 3-CD=CHD, cis-CD3-CD=CHD, and CD 3=CD-CH 2 polymerization 
products revealed that the main type of irregularity in isotactic polypropylene is mrrm (see 
Table 111-2) which gives rise to two octets oflow intensity in the CH2 region (rrm tetrad) and 
to two doublets in the CH3 region, one for the mr triad and the second for the rr triad. Another 
type of irregularity was found to be rrr (a triplet in the CH2 region). Stereochemical conse-
quences of these findings are discussed in Section 111-3. 
Quantitative Methods. 
Two main approaches were explored. The first one was 
measurement of the syndiotactic dyad content in a polymer by calculation of the 
relative peak areas for CHz protons in syndiotactic and isotactic dyads or the 
relative peak area for the syndiotactic dyad normalized to the total amount of 
(CHz + CH 3) units [46, 57-60]. Unfortunately these signals in spectra recorded 
at 60 or 100 MHz are strongly overlapped, which complicates the measurement 
procedure. In one of the methods [46] the ratio is measured of the areas for one of the 
syndiotactic CHz peaks, at T = 8.99 ppm, and for the overlap of syndiotactic and 
isotactic peaks at T = 9.06 ppm. Mixtures ofisotactic and syndiotactic polypropyl-
ene were used for calibration. According to Ref. [45] the method [46], when applied 
to stereo block or atactic polypropylene samples, underestimates the amount of 

III-2: Methods of Measurement of Polyolefin Stereoregularity 
235 
isotactic block content. However, the error is insignificant in the case of highly 
isotactic samples. An increase of the spectrometer magnetic field gives one the 
possibility to reduce the above-mentioned overlap of different CH2 signals (at 220 
MHz) or even to almost eliminate it (at 300 MHz) [56, 61]. The second approach in 
the application of 1 H -NMR spectra of usual polypropylene samples to the quantita-
tive estimation of stereoregularity is based on the difference in the positions of CH3 
proton signals for iso-tactic, hetero-tactic, and syndio-tactic triads (see, for 
example, Figs. 1II-4 and III-5) [57, 63, 64]. The precision of this method is severely 
limited by the strong overlap of these peaks (see Fig. III-5) as well as by the 
interference from some of the CH2 protons (see Fig. III-4(AÂ» which results in an 
overestimation of hetero- and syndio-dyad content in highly isotactic polypropyl-
ene samples. 
Thus, strictly speaking, the 1 H-NMR spectra of polypropylene do not provide a 
convenient and straightforward means for polymer stereo-regularity evaluation, as 
is the case for many vinyl polymers [42, 43]. Of course, resolution can be improved 
significantly when one uses deuterated polypropylene samples for this purpose [12, 
49,56,64]. 
Unfortunately the synthesis of such samples in significant volume and under 
various polymerization conditions is very expensive. For this reason no systematic 
study of the dependence of polypropylene stereoregularity on polymerization con-
ditions has yet been performed with the application of deuterated polymers. 
Polypropylene 13C-NMR Spectra. 
13C-NMR spectra of polypropylene have been 
widely studied and the analyses of such spectra has proved to be the most reliable 
and accurate quantitative method for the measurement of stereo regularity. The 
decoupled spectra of purely isotactic and syndiotactic polymers are simple and 
consist of three peaks, readily assigned to CH2 , CH, and CH3 carbon atoms (see 
Fig. III-6 [65]) using the method given in Ref. [66]. High-resolution studies [67, 68] 
showed that all these signals are sensitive to the stereochemical environment in a 
polymer chain. Especially beneficial for quantitative measurement is the stereo-
chemical splitting of the CH3 signal which provides the ready possibility to estimate 
triad, pentad, and even heptad (at 90 MHz) stereo sequence distributions in polypro-
pylene samples. The assignment of particular peaks to different triads, pentads, and 
heptads is based on calculations of stereochemical shifts [67-71], on the study of 
13C-Iabeled model compounds [67, 72], on comparison with IH-NMR spectra, on 
the spectrum of epimerized isotactic polypropylene [56, 61], and on the comparison 
of different spectra and statistical calculations [21, 73-75]. The generally accepted 
assignment of the CH3 region in the spectrum of predominantly isotactic polypro-
pylene is shown in Fig. 1II-7(A) and the heptad assignments for an atactic polymer 
in Fig. III-7(B) (from Ref. [68]). The evaluation of polypropylene stereo structure is 
usually based on relative peak areas. 
The stereochemical splitting of the CH2 signal can be used also. Hexad re-
sonances were assigned in high-resolution spectra [67,68] but substantial overlap of 
several tetrad resonances (especially those ofrmr, rrr, mmr, mmm, and mrr tetrads) 
makes this spectral region much less reliable for polypropylene structure determi-
nation than the CH3 region.

Poly-i-butene. 
The overlap of signals in the 1 H-NMR spectra of poly-I-butene is 
so strong that the interpretation of these spectra becomes unreliable [42]. For this 
reason no data about the estimation of poly-I-butene stereospecificity parameters is 
available in the literature. 
On the other hand, the 13C-NMR spectra of this polymer are much more 
promising (Fig. 1II-8) [76, 77]. Whereas the signals of the main chain CH2 groups 
are practically insensitive to the sample stereoregularity, all other signals demon-
strate such sensitivity. The spectra allow precise measurement of different triads and 
in some instances even stereopentads. For example, the stereo triad composition in 
different atactic poly-I-butene samples is: [mm] = 0.21-0.51; [mr] = 0.25-0.35; [rr] 
= 0.27-0.36 [76]. 
Polystyrene. 
Polystyrene was the first polymer whose lH-NMR spectrum was 
recorded and now this spectrum is interpreted in full detail [43, 78]. The comparison 
of the spectra of the isotactic and atactic polymers showed that they differ mainly in

the signals due to CH protons of the main chain [42, 43, 78-82]. A closely spaced 
quintuplet (300 MHz) at b = 2.1 ppm in the spectrum of isotactic polystyrene is 
assigned to mm triads whereas a broad signal in the range b = 1.6-2 ppm, present in 
the spectra of radical and cationic polystyrene samples, was initially assigned to rr 
triads. This resulted in the conclusion that these polymers are predominantly 
syndiotactic. The r dyad content for radical polymer was estimated to be in the 0.7-
0.75 range [83]. However, the study of epimerized isotactic polystyrenes [78] and 
theoretical calculations [84] showed that the peak in the b = 1.6-2 ppm range 
belongs not only to rr triads but to mr and rm triads as well. Corresponding re-
evaluation gave r dyad content for radical polystyrene of only 0.55-0.56 [78, 85], 
i.e., this is virtually an atactic polymer. 1 H-NMR study of polystyrene-d7 [86] sim-
plifies stereo sequence assignment.

The 13C-NMR spectra ofisotactic and atactic polystyrene were studied in detail 
[87-94] as well as those of some polymer models [95-97]. The quaternary aromatic 
carbon signals are especially sensitive to the polystyrene stereostructure (Fig. III-9) 
and enable one to measure the stereo-pentad composition. Examination of the 13C_ 
NMR spectra of "isotactic fractions" of polystyrene obtained with the TiC14-AlEt3 
catalytic system in heptane solution at 80Â°C [98] reveals no mr or rr signals, 
indicating a very high (>95%) mm content for the sample. This conclusion is 
consistent with the results of the 1 H -NMR spectra study of isotactic polystyrene-d7 
[86] which yields an estimate of the steric purity of the polymer of 97.6%. On the 
other hand, a partly isotactic polystyrene sample obtained with the alfin catalyst 
contains both long isotactic and long atactic sequences [99]. 
Two quantitative methods have been proposed [89, 90] for estimating the isotac-
ticity of polystyrene from 13C-NMR spectra. One of them was developed for highly 
isotactic specimens and the second for polystyrene samples of relatively low isotac-
ticity. Raw polystyrene obtained with heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts usu-
ally contains a certain amount of the cationic polymer as an impurity. When this 
sterically irregular polymer is separated from the mixture (usually by extraction 
with ketones) isotactic polymer with low molecular weight is also dissolved. Its 
amount in such extracts was estimated [100] by the 13C-NMR method. The method 

240 
III: Stereospecificity of Heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta Catalysts 
is based on the separation of the peak area of the mm-quaternary carbon signal into 
two components, one belonging to the soluble isotactic polymer and the other to the 
atactic cationic polymer. The last value was estimated from a statistical relationship 
between the [mm] : [mr] : [rr] ratios and the experimentally measured [mr] : [rr] ratio. 
ill-2-b. Infrared Spectroscopy 
Theoretical Principles. 
In contrast to NMR methods, the theory for the interpretation 
of IR spectra of nonideal polymer chains cannot be regarded as generally accepted and is still 
in a state of refinement. For this reason it seems justified to outline briefly the main ideas con-
stituting the method. 
The first stage in understanding the vibrational spectra of nonideal polymer chains is, of 
course, interpretation of the vibrational spectra of perfectly regular polymers. The principal 
solution to this problem was given [101] by applying factor-group analysis to the selection 
rules of polymer vibrational spectra. This method was successfully used for the calculation of 
vibrational (IR and Raman) spectra of different polymers and now is regarded as the 
established theory. The calculations of the vibrational spectra of different polyolefins include 
those for isotactic polypropylene [102-105], isotactic poly-I-butene [106], and isotactic 
polystyrene [107]. Without discussing details of the theory it is expedient to say that the 
calculations were carried out for infinite polymer chains obeying the equivalence rule: all 
monomer units are geometrically equivalent with respect to the symmetry elements of a 
macromolecule [108]. Inter-chain interactions are usually not taken into account. 
Only two types of chain vibrations are active in the IR spectra of regularly built macro-
molecules [109, 110]: 
(i) Modes involving in-phase vibrations of all equivalent atoms in the chain (A-type modes). 
These modes have their transition vectors parallel to the macromolecule axis and the 
corresponding bands in IR polarized spectra exhibit parallel dichroism. 
(ii) Modes with a definite phase shift for the movements of neighbor unit atoms, which is 
equal to 2nnjp (n-the identity number of a helix,p-the number of units in the identity 
period). The bands of this type (in a general case E-type modes) exhibit perpendicular 
dichroism in polarized IR spectra. 
It is evident that the requirement of infinite length is not realistic even for configuration-
ally regular polymers because they usually exist in lamellar crystalline form with conforma-
tionally regular blocks (helix segments) ranging in length from 100 to 200 A. Nevertheless 
theoretical <:alculations of vibrational normal modes performed for infinite chains usually 
agree well with the experimental results for crystalline polymers, i.e., conformationally 
regular blocks of a finite but significant length are sufficient for selection rule fulfillment. 
The situation changes when one examines chains with some number of defects. To a first 
approximation, the origin of these defects is of minor importance. They can be conforma-
tional (when the polymer is in an amorphous form), configurational (when, for example, an 
isotactic polymer chain contains syndio-defects), or chemical (in copolymers). Introduction 
of these defects results in three spectral changes: 
(i) New modes appear, concentrated in the vicinity of the defect (local modes). 
(ii) Selection rules become "softer", i.e., new modes become active in addition to the 
previously mentioned A- and E-modes. These new modes usually produce IR bands of 
low intensity and they can be neglected to a first approximation. 

III -2: Methods of Measurement of Polyolefin Stereoregularity 
241 
(iii) The most important consequence is that the decrease of the regular block lengthj brings 
about a monotonous change of the allowed mode frequences Vi and a monotonous 
change of the absorption coefficients Kj for the bands. For this reason, when the length 
of a regular polymer chain is reduced by any means, some of its IR bands broaden asym-
metrically due to the appearance of many closely spaced bands belonging to short blocks 
of various lengths. 
The expression for Vj of a regular monomer sequence consisting ofj units is [111, 112] 
2

(III-I) 
where Ak is a constant, and M is usually 1 or 2. For many polymers with carbon main chains 
M = 1 [112] and the above expression is reduced to 
Vf = A - Bcos-11:-
} 
j + I 
(III-2) 
Usually whenjis large Vj does not depend on the defect structure but this dependence becomes 
more pronounced as j decreases. Equations 111-1 and 111-2 are valid for the spectra of both 
isotactic and syndiotactic polymers. Whenj increases Vj asymptotically approaches the value 
of v'" for an ideally regular infinite macromolecule. A decrease of j results not only in the 
change in Vj but also in a change of the absorption coefficient K j â¢ The problem of the Krj 
dependence is only beginning to be studied theoretically [ll3, 114]. Usually Kj decreases with 
a decrease inj. 
Thus one can predict the following influence of jon vJ and 10: whenj is large enough both 
Vj and 10 remain practically constant but asj decreases both these parameters begin to change 
gradually. If a polymer chain contains regular segments of different sizes the corresponding 
IR band has a complex asymmetric shape. The ideal approach to stereoregularity measure-
ment would be the separation of the individual components forming such a complex band 
and the estimation of monomer unit distribution in different regular blocks, much the same 
way as in 13C-NMR spectra. Unfortunately, these components are usually so closely spaced 
that they overlap completely. Moreover, usually the parameter A in Eqn. 111-2, as well as the 
Kj versus j dependence, are unknown. For this reason a simplified method was developed: the 
band absorption is measured at v'" (the band position for a regular chain) under the assump-
tion that the contribution of short blocks to this absorption is negligibly small because their 
band maxima are shifted significantly from v'" and their 10 are smaller. This qualitative des-
cription can be formulated quantitatively using a threshold approximation: for all short 
blocks (smallj) the 10(v",) values at the wavenumber v'" are zero and starting from some par-
ticular effective value jeff, 10 is independent of j and is equal to Kj =",: 
forj <jeff K(v",) = 0 
for j > jeff 
K(v",) = const. 
The threshold approximation was formulated in Ref. [l15] and used by many authors [59, 
116-120]. Its possible limitations are discussed in Ref. [117]. The usefulness of the threshold 
approximation is especially clear when one considers a frequent particular case of the 
theoretical scheme described above; Vj depends weakly onj but 10 depends strongly on it. In 
such a case an increase in defect concentration in the polymer chain decreases the mean j 

242 
III: Stereospecificity of Heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta Catalysts 
value; no real broadening of a regularity band takes place but its absorption decreases 
significantly. In such a case the threshold approximation is the only plausible approach that 
can be used to treat the experimental data. The Jeff values are usually estimated from the 
spectra of olefin copolymers (best of all from the IR spectra of the copolymers of nondeuter-
ated and deuterated derivatives of the same monomer) or by comparison ofthe IR and NMR 
data for polyolefins [120]. 
It can be seen from the preceding discussion that IR and NMR methods measure different 
stereo regularity parameters. Whereas NMR methods give information about the content of 
different stereosequences, both regular (for example, mmmm or rrrr pentads) and irregular 
(like mmrr or mrmm pentads), the IR spectroscopic method measures only the fractions of 
monomer units situated in the sum of sufficiently long regular blocks, i.e., the sum of units in 
the blocks of the type L(D)nL or D(L)nD (isotactic sequences) or D(DL)nL (syndiotactic 
sequences) where n ;;;;: Jeff' Infrared spectroscopy usually cannot identify irregular sequences 
of the type DLDD (the rrm tetrad) or DDLLD (the mrmr pentad). As was mentioned 
previously, all three usual types of polymer chain disorder-conformational, configu-
rational, and chemical-produce approximately the same changes in polymer IR spectra. 
Hence, if one studies homopolymers which have practically no chemical disorder (no second 
monomer units and practically no isomerized and "head-to-head" linked units-see Section 
III-I) and wants to estimate the configurational disorder (stereoregularity) one has to 
eliminate conformational defects from the polymer samples as completely as possible. There 
are two general ways to do this: 
(i) to study IR spectra of polymer solutions at low temperature [116,118-120], 
(ii) to study IR spectra of carefully crystallized polymers [59, 119-121]. 
Both methods in principle yield helical conformations for practically all stereoregular seg-
ments as evidenced from the study of polymer mixtures and block -copolymers [120, 121]. The 
application of the first method is severely limited by the low solubility of most isotactic 
polymers (isotactic polystyrene is the only exception) but the second method is very conve-
nient and has been widely applied. The most appropriate crystallization technique is the 
annealing of polymer samples in vacuum at temperatures 10-20Â°C below their melting points 
[122]. 
Polypropylene. 
Figure III-IO shows the IR spectra of isotactic and syndiotactic 
polypropylene both in a crystalline and in an amorphous form. The spectra provide 
a good opportunity to distinguish the type of stereoregularity and to make quantita-
tive measurements. There are two types of bands suitable for isotacticity measure-
ment (see also Table III-3). Some bands observed in the spectra of the crystalline 
samples are absent in the spectra of the polymer melt and in the spectra of atactic 
polypropylene samples (1220, 1168, 998, 900, 841, 809 cm -1) and, following the 
empirical classification presented in Ref. [123], can be named "helix" bands. In the 
syndiotactic polypropylene spectrum they are at 1005, 977, and 867 cm -1. The 
reason for the disappearance of these bands from the melt spectra is that the 
effective regular sequence length jeff for the corresponding modes is higher than the 
average length of helix blocks in the melt [59, 120, 124, 125]. Decrease in the 
intensity of these bands in the spectra of irregular samples is not accompanied by 
their asymmetric broadening. Table III-3 includes the most popular methods of 
polypropylene isotacticity measurement based on IR band absorbances. As is often 
the case in studies of polymer IR spectra, internal standard methods are employed.

a All bands in polypropylene IR spectra are assigned to the modes of isolated polymer chains [123] and 
polymer crystallinity in a strict sense (a three-dimensional order) has no influence on the spectra. The 
existence of the correlation between the A84dA1168 ratio and polypropylene density can be explained by 
an obvious reason: polymer crystallinity measured under some standard conditions depends on its 
s tereoregularity. 
The IR spectra of amorphous polypropylene samples are also sensitive to the 
type of polymer regularity. The most pronounced difference is in the 900-1000 
cm -1 region-see Fig. III -11. Amorphous isotactic polypropylene is characterized 
by a single asymmetric band at 973 cm-1 [59, 115, 120, 134-137] and amorphous 
syndiotactic polypropylene has two bands. The first one is at 977 cm -1 and belongs 
to the helix segments with the TTGG conformation and the second one is at 962 
cm -1 and belongs to chain segments with the planar TT conformation [138]. A 
polymer with a structure very close to perfectly atactic (obtained at 20 0e in AgN0 3 
aqueous solution in the presence of the radical initiator (NH4)2S20S' [59]) has in 
this region a broad, weak unresolved band with a maximum at 968 cm -1 and two 
shoulders at 960 and 973 cm -1, whereas in the IR spectra of partially isotactic 
polypropylene samples, the 973 cm -1 band is skewed on the long wavelength side 
due to the absorption of short isotactic sequences. The presence of the intense 973

cm -1 band in the spectra of predominantly isotactic polypropylene samples was 
used for the measurement of polypropylene isotacticity [59, 139]. The "spectral 
isotacticity degree" CJ. is calculated as 
CJ. = A973/A 1460 X 100 (%) 
N 
(III-3) 
where N is the absorption coefficient ratio (N = 0.265). This simple expression for CJ. 
is valid only in the case of samples with relatively high isotactic contents, whereas in 
the case of less stereo regular polymers a special correction is necessary to account 
for the syndiotactic block contribution to A973 [59]. Theieff value for the 973 cm-1 
band is 4-5 [59, 120, 125, 134-137]. Another method of polypropylene isotacti-
city estimation that is based on the 973 cm -1 band makes use of the band shape 
which is symmetric in the spectra of highly regular polymers and is highly asym-
metric in the spectra of irregular samples [140]. 
Judging by the ieff values, the relative sensitivities of different IR methods for 
polypropylene isotacticity measurement are not the same and decrease in the order: 
AS41/A973 (or AS4dA1170) > A998/A 973 (or A998/AI460) > A973/AI460' When 
highly isotactic samples are examined, measurements of the A84d A973 or 
A998/A973 ratios have significant advantages over the CJ.(A973/AI460) measurement. 
These precise methods require careful sample annealing before recording of the 
spectrum [122] to exclude conformational defects. On the other hand, the CJ. value 
(Eqn. III-3) is practically insensitive to sample aggregation [59] and this measure-
ment is the only plausible IR method for isotacticity estimation for samples of low 
regularity when all "helix" bands (see Table III-3) are virtually absent from the 

246

spectra. Special warning has to be given against direct numerical comparison of 
isotacticity parameters derived from different IR data as well as the comparison of 
IR and NMR data for the same sample. Such comparisons can only be done 
correctly using statistical parameters calculated from the spectral data. The 
methods for calculating these statistical parameters and the parameter comparisons 
are presented in Section 111-4. 
Poly-I-butene. 
Isotactic poly-I-butene exists in four polymorphic modifications 
[141, 142], which complicates significantly the estimation of its stereoregularity by 
the IR method. Two types of bands are present in the IR spectrum of poly-I-butene 
in modification 1 (stable hexagonal polymorph) [143]: 
(i) "helix" bands at 1208, 1098, 1059, 1028,922,849, and 816 cm -1. These bands 
are absent from the spectra of poly-I-butene melts. 
(ii) regularity bands at 1221, 972, and 917 cm -1. These bands are specific for 
isotactic poly-I-butene in all aggregate states. 
A correlation exists between the relative intensity of the 1221 cm-1 band and 
polymer specific volume d 3 (the 1151 cm-1 band absorbance was used as the 
internal thickness standard): 
47.05 
(A122t!A1151)solid = 54.96 - -d-
A linear correlation was proposed between the (A1221/A1151)solid ratio and the 
isotacticity parameters IB : 
(111-4) 
Caution is necessary when one applies this expression to the IR spectra of freshly 
molded poly-I-butene films because these films contain mainly the tetragonal 
modification II of the polymer. The transformation of modification II to modifica-
tion 1 can be achieved by film annealing (3 weeks at 20Â°C or 16 hours at 60Â°C) or, 
more simply, by stretching the films 25-35% [144]. 
Poly-3-methyl-l-butene. 
Figure 111-12 shows the IR spectra of crystalline and 
molten poly-3-methyl-l-butene [145]. The "helix" bands most sensitive to the poly-
mer stereoregularity are situated at 1218,940, and 778 cm-1 and can be used for 
isotacticity estimation. The 1178 cm -1 band can be conveniently used as an internal 
measure of the polymer film thickness because its intensity is not significantly 
influenced by polymer crystallinity and it is present in the IR spectrum of totally 
atactic poly-3-methyl-I-butene that is obtained by hydrogenation of atactic poly-

Poly-4-methyl-I-pentene. Comparison of the IR spectra of crystalline isotactic, 
molten isotactic, and atactic poly-4-methyl-l-pentene [146, 147] reveals "helix" 
bands at 1129, 996, 943, and 848 em -1. The 996 cm -1 band is the most convenient 
one for isotacticity measurement. Thejeff value for this band is 5-6 [120, 146, 147].

Isotactic Polystyrene. The IR spectra of isotactic and atactic polystyrene samples 
have been carefully studied [118-121, 148] and many "helix" bands of the isotactic 
chain were found (see review [120]): at 1085 cm -1 (jeff = 5), 1054 cm -1 (jeff = 10), 
985 cm-1, 918 em-I (jeff = 9-11), 901 cm-1 (jeff = 17),586 cm-I, and 565 cm-1 
(jeff = 5-6), etc. Unfortunately most of these bands strongly overlap with bands 
that are characteristic of atactic polystyrene (1070, 965, 805 cm -1) which prevents 
their use for quantitative stereoregularity analysis. However, a qualitative estima-
tion is easy to make, for example, from the 1100-1040 cm-1 region and it is very 
helpful for a rapid structure assignment [149]. The most convenient band for quanti-
tative measurement is the 565 cm -1 band which is relatively free from overlap with 
the nearest band at 540 cm -1 which is assigned mostly to syndiotactic sequences. 
The 1603 cm -1 band can be used as an internal thickness standard because absorp-
tion coefficients of this band are very similar in the spectra of the isotactic (16.0 liter / 
molÂ· em) and atactic polymers (16.8 liter/molÂ· cm). The isotacticity parameter of 
polystyrene Ips, can be calculated as: 
Ips = AS6S/A1603 X 100 (%) 
N 
(111-7) 
where N is the absorption coefficient ratio and is equal to 1.85. This simple 
expression is valid only for polymers with a low level of syndiotactic sequences 
because it does not take into account the overlap of the 565 and 540 cm -1 bands. 
III-2-c. 
Melting Point and Polyolefin Stereoregularity 
The theoretical expression for the correlation between the melting point of a 
semicrystalline polymer and its thermodynamic and structural characteristics is 
[151] (Flory equation): 
(111-8) 
where Tm is the polymer equilibrium melting point, T:' that for the perfectly regular 
polymer, ABu the heat of polymer fusion per crystallized unit, R the gas constant, 
and p the probability for a given stereo-unit selected at random to be followed by a 
unit with the same structure and configuration. This expression predicts a signifi-
cant melting point depression with a decrease of the polymer regularity character-
istics. Such melting point behavior has been proved experimentally in many cases 
(see, for example, Refs. [152] and [153]). The most familiar example is the melting 
point depression of branched low density polyethylene (120-125Â°C) with respect to 
linear polyethylene samples (135-140Â°). Another example is described in Ref. [56]: 
when the racemic dyad concentration in polypropylene was increased from 2 to 
13% (in the course of the epimerization reaction) the polymer melting point

249 
dropped from 162 to 126Â°C. The statistical meaning of the p parameter is explained 
in Section III-4-a (Eqn. III-27). 
In principle, the method of stereo regularity estimation based on melting point 
measurements is very straightforward and the data obtained can be readily com-
pared with NMR and IR data (Section 111-4-a). However, the method has two 
significant practical shortcomings. First, the I1Hu value is difficult to measure 
precisely and different authors give widely diverging estimations. For example, the 
I1Hu estimations for isotactic polypropylene range from 2600 cal/mol [154, 155] and 
2370 cal/mol [156] to 460 cal/mol [12]. The second shortcoming is the Tm measure-
ment procedure itself. The measurement of an equilibrium Tm is a complicated and 
time-consuming procedure and it is usually replaced by more rapid techniques like 
DT A analysis which as a rule result in substantial underestimation of both Tm and 
T/:.. For these reasons the application of melting point measurements for estimation 
of the absolute stereoregularity parameters (p, for example) is limited. On the other 
hand, application of Tm values and effective p values as empirical parameters 
indicative of polyolefin regularity (especially for isotactic polypropylene) is very 
popular. It is especially useful when all measurements are performed by the same 
authors and with application of the same Tm measurement technique. The param-
eters of Eqn. 111-8 are: 
for polypropylene I1Hu = 2600 [154, 155], 2370 [156], or 1900 [157] cal/mol, 
T/:. = 170De [120,155], 176 De [158-160], or 184De [157]. 
for isotactic polystyrene I1Hu = 2069.6 cal/mol [161], T/:. (equilibrium) = 228 De, 
T/:.(DTA) = 213 or 220De (for samples crystallized at 140 and 190De, 
respectively) [162]. 
for polyethylene I1Hu = 1120 [163]-960 [164] cal/mol, T/:. = 135Se [164]-
141 DC [163]. 
Recently a modification of Eqn. 111-8 was proposed [165] which takes into account 
the formation of short-range quasi-crystalline ordered regions, even in completely 
atactic polymers. This modification results in decreases of effective I1Hu values, by a 
factor of up to 1.8-1.9 in the case of polypropylene. The method is based on the 
application of Eqn. 111-8 and cannot be used for stereoregularity estimations of 
polymer samples with low molecular weight (in the case of polypropylene, lower 
than 30,000) because Tm values of low molecular weight polymers, even those of 
high steric purity, are substantially lower than those of their high molecular weight 
analogues [159].

Enantiomorphons Statistical Model of Stereospecific Olefin 
Polymerization and Its Experimental Proof 
Experimental data based on NMR studies have demonstrated that isotactic 
polyolefins obtained with typical heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts are not 
ideally regular. Being highly isotactic they nevertheless contain some small but 
definite amount of short syndiotactic monomer sequences. The estimations for 

250 
III: Stereospecificity of Heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta Catalysts 
different polypropylene fractions based on the 1 H-NMR method [56,57,59] and on 
the 13C-NMR method [12, 166], as well as the estimations for isotactic poly-l-
butene by the 13C-NMR method [76], showed that the racemic dyad content of 
polyolefin fractions (even those insoluble in boiling heptane) varies from 1 to 5%, 
i.e., all these polymers exhibit some steric defects in their chain structure. 
The principal question arises: what kind of stereo-defects are present in 
polyolefin chains? This problem is a very important one because exact data on the 
defect structure can give significant insight into the mechanism of the stereospecific 
action of heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts. Early in the study of stereospecific 
vinyl polymerization two principally different "errors" in stereoregular polymer 
chains were considered [167]. The first one is the change of monomer unit chirality: 
.. . DDDDDDDLLLLLLL . .. 
This kind of steric defect is traditionally connected with the idea of "growing 
chain end control" [168]. If the stereo regularity ofthe step of monomer addition to a 
growing polymer chain is governed by electronic or steric interactions between the 
approaching monomer molecule and the last unit of the growing chain (a free 
radical or an ion) and if such interactions result in an isotactic sequence (as shown 
above) then the accidental change of the addition stereochemistry, DL instead of 
DD, leads to the change in the last monomer unit chirality and all subsequent 
monomer molecules will add to the growing chain end, forming an L-type block 
instead of a D-type block (or vice versa). The same type of a stereoerror can be 
explained by a different mechanism which is more consistent with the idea of 
heterogeneous catalysis. Imagine some catalytic center producing D-type se-
quences. Accidentally the polymer chain separates itself from the active center by 
some unspecified dissociation process and attaches to some other active center 
(formerly free) which is able to polymerize olefins to the L-typechains. In such a 
case the concentration of the stereo-defects will be determined by the frequency of 
the polymer chain migration. 
Another kind of a simple steric error can be envisaged as: 
... DDDDDDDDLDDDDDDDD ... 
or 
... LLLLLLLLDLLLLLLLL . .. 
This error occurs when a stereospecific active center normally producing a given 
isotactic polymer chain (D- or L-type) makes an error and then merely "corrects" 
itself in the next addition step and continues to produce the same type of polymer 
chain. Following the idea that the steric peculiarities of olefin polymerization are 
controlled by the steric structures of the enantimorphous catalytic centers [169, 
170], this type of steric error is a manifestation of the "enantiomorphous" control of 
chain growth [168]. 
When one examines predominantly isotactic polymer chains with only a few 

111-3: Enantiomorphous Statistical Model of Stereospecific Olefin Polymerization 
251 
steric defects that are separated from each other (i.e., when the accidental proximity 
of two defects can be ignored) the two principal types of errors can be readily 
distinguished by the NMR method. If we use a standard NMR notation for the 
description of stereo sequences (see Section III-2-a) we have: 
Chain end control 
DDDDDLLLLL 
mmmmrmmmm 
Enantiomorphous center control 
DDDDDLDDDDD 
mmmmrrmmmm 
These two stereocontrol mechanisms correspond to different relationships between 
the amounts of various steric sequences: 
For "chain end control": 
Triads: only mr and rm sequences are present,4 [rr] = O. 
Tetrads: [mmr] + [rmm] = 2[mrm]; [mrr] = [rrm] = O. 
Pentads: [mmmr] + [rmmm] = [mmrm] + [mrmm]; [mmrr] = [rrmm] = [mrrm] 
=0. 
Hexads: [mmmmr] + [rmmmm] = [mmmrm] + [mrmmm] = 2[mmrmm]; [mmmrr] 
= [rrmmm] = [mmrrm] = [mrrmm] = O. 
For "enantiomorphous center control": 
Triads: [mr] + [rm] = 2[rr] 
Tetrads: [mmr] + [rmm] = [mrr] + [rrm]; [mrm] = O. 
Pentads: [mmmr] + [rmmm] = [mmrr] + [rrmm] = 2[mrrm]; [mmrm] = [mrmm] 
=0. 
Hexads: [mmmmr] + [rmmmm] = [mmmrr] + [rrmmm] = [mmrrm] + [mrrmm]; 
[mmrmm] = O. 
Numerous experimental data on the IH-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra of differ-
ent polypropylene and poly-I-butene samples demonstrated that the "enantiomor-
phous control" mechanism operates in the case of isospecific olefin polymerization 
with heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts: 
(i) rr and mr triads exist in polypropylene chains [56] and in poly-I-butene chains 
[76] in small but detectable amounts. 
4 In the case of polyolefins, reverse sequences (e.g., mr and rm, mmr and rmm, mmmrm and mrmmm, etc.) 
are indistinguishable and are always present in chains in equal concentrations, e.g., [mr] = [rm], [mmr] 
= [rmm], etc.

The most elaborate experimental data confirming the applicability of the enant-
iomorphous control mechanism have been presented in Ref. [12] where the number 
average length ofisotactic sequences containing at least 3m-dyads, 73 = ([mmmm] 
+ 2[mmmr])/([mmrr]/2), for different fractions ofisotactic polypropylene was com-
pared with statistical calculations (see Fig. 111-13). It was demonstrated that "while 
isotactic polymers are made up ofisotactic stereoblocks interrupted by rr-pairs and 
follow the sequential statistics generated by enantiomorphous propagational model 
strictly, moderately isotactic polymers would also contain isotactic stereoblocks 
joined by sequences generated by a different propagation model." These deviations 
from the simple enantiomorphous model in the case of so-called "stereo block" and 
"atactic" polyolefin fractions were also found in Ref. [166]. This problem is dis-
cussed in Section IV-I. 
In addition to the proofs of the enantiomorphous stereocontrol mechanism 
presented above, some independent data exist confirming the mechanism. The first 
of these proofs is related to chemical defects in polyolefin chains (Section 111-11) 
and the second to the study of stereoselectivity in the process of copolymerization of 
optically active monomers (Section 111-10). The consequences of the enantiomor-
phous control mechanism governing isotactic polyolefin formation are very impor-
tant for the elaboration of the polymerization mechanism discussed in detail in 
Chapter V. It is necessary to mention here that in the case of syndiotactic polypro-

pylene formation with soluble Ziegler-Natta catalysts at low temperatures, the 
stereocontrol mechanism is different ("chain end control" [54, 173, 174]) and 
the main defects in polypropylene chains are of the type DLDLDLLDLDLD 
(rrrrrmrrrrr). These polymers also have chemical chain defects such as "head-to-
head" monomer linking, in addition to steric defects [54]. 
ID-4. Statistics of Olefin Homopolymerization and 
Copolymerization on Stereospecific Active Centers 
As can be seen from the previous section, isospecific centers of heterogeneous 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts usually link monomer units in a polymer chain with the 
formation of isotactic sequences, but occasionally they make errors and produce 
syndiotactic links. As a rule, such errors are corrected by the centers in the next 
polymerization step and polymer growth is continued in an isotactic mode. The 
more isospecific a catalytic center is, the less frequently such errors occur. Of course, 
different centers present on the catalyst surface are characterized by different 
frequencies of steric errors but in the following discussion only centers of equal 
stereospecificity are considered. The data on the distribution of active centers with 
different stereospecificities are discussed in Section IV-I. The purpose of the statis-
tical analysis presented below is to correlate two characteristics of active centers: (a) 
stereoregularity parameters of polyolefins they produce (which are measured by 
NMR, IR techniques, etc.), and (b) the principal kinetic parameter of the active 
centers, the frequency with which they generate steric errors in the polymer chains. 
Ill-4-a. Homopolymerization 
Any imperfectly stereoregular polymer can be regarded from a stereochemical 
point of view as a copolymer containing two types of monomer units, designated, 
for example, D and L. The "copolymer composition" and its unit distribution are 
functions of polymer stereoregularity and the types of steric errors the polymer 
contains (see previous section). In the simplest case, the formation of a stereoregular 
homopolymer is the result of four propagation reactions: 
kDD 
Cat-D-Polymer + M __ Cat-D-D-Polymer 
kDL 
Cat-D-Polymer + M-- Cat-L-D-Polymer 
kLL 
Cat-L-Polymer + M-- Cat-L-L-Polymer 
(III-9) 
kLD 
Cat-L-Polymer + M-- Cat-D-L-Polymer 
Here, kDD and kLL are propagation rate constants for isotactic enchainment, and kDL 

254 
III: Stereospecificity of Heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta Catalysts 
and kLD are propagation rate constants for syndiotactic enchainment. (Note, that in 
the symbols kDL and kLD the first letter of the subscripts defines a configuration of 
the last unit in a polymer chain before addition of a monomer and the second letter 
ofthe subscripts defines a configuration of the monomer after the moment it entered 
the chain and became the last unit in it). 
The kinetic approach to the statistical treatment of this simple "copolymeri-
zation" scheme is well established [175]. Copolymerization of two different co-
monomers is described by two parameters, reactivity ratios '1 and'2 (Eqn. 1-63). 
By analogy, two stereo-reactivity ratios, Rl and R 2 , are introduced to describe 
stereospecific homopolymerization of a single monomer (Reactions III-9):

where [D]pol and [L]pol are fractions of D and L units in a polymer chain. 
A few comments about terminology are necessary before statistical correlations 
for homopolymers are presented. The area of measurement of polymer stereore-
gularity was dominated during the two past decades by NMR spectroscopists. They 
developed a system of notation (described in Section III-2-a) which was well suited 
to the peculiarities of NMR spectroscopy-sensitivity of chemical shifts of parti-
cular hydrogen or carbon atoms in a polymer chain to configurations of neighbor-
ing monomer units. This phenomenon brought about widely used notations: meso-
and racemic dyads, isotactic (DDD and LLL), syndiotactic (DLD and LDL), and 
heterotactic (DLL, LDD, LLD, and DLL) triads, etc. 
However, from a chemist's point of view the parameters of principal importance 
are (as far as Reactions III-9 are concerned) four propagation rate constants, kDD' 
kLL' kDL' and kLL' and, in particular, the ratios of these constants, R1 and R 2 , which 
describe the preference of isotactic enchainment (DD and LL) with respect to 
syndiotactic enchainment (DL and LD). For this reason, the words "isotactic" and 
"syndiotactic" are used throughout the book to describe steric structure of polymer 
chains and corresponding statistical relationships. Terminologies used by specialists 
in NMR and IR spectroscopies are introduced only to describe parameters es-
timated by the respective methods of measurement. 
Following Ref. [175] the probabilities ofisotactic and syndiotactic placements in 
a polymer chain are:

III: Stereospecificity of Heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta Catalysts 
As can be seen in a general case two kinetic parameters, Rl and Rz, are sufficient for 
the description of a stereo regular polymer structure. However, these expressions 
can be considerably simplified when one takes into account two particular models 
of stereoregular chain growth, those involving enantiomorphous control and chain 
(!nd control. 
Enantiomorphous Control Mechanism. 
As was discussed in Section 1II-3 this mech-
anism of stereo sequence generation operates during olefin polymerization with 
heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts. According to this model, the surface of a 
heterogeneous catalyst contains two types of active centers in equal amounts. One 
type produces predominantly D-isotactic chains independent of the structure of the 
last unit in the growing chain (D-centers). For such centers the following relation-
ships between different propagation rate constants hold 
(the formation of a D monomer unit is preferred). Another type of active center (L-
center) produces predominantly L-isotactic polymers also independently of the last 
unit structure. For the L-centers: 
The kinetic parameters for these two types of active centers are: 
for D-centers: 
R = kDD > 1Â· 
1 
k 
' 
DL 
(III-I 6) 
for L-centers: 
(III-17) 
Both types of active centers (D and L) possess equal stereo regulating power, i.e., 
Rl for a D-center is equal to Rz for an L-center. This single kinetic parameter 
(denoted R, R > 1) represents the ratio of two propagation constants, one corre-
sponding to typical isotactic addition (DD for aD-center, LL for a L-center) and the 
second to a catalyst "mistake" (DL for aD-center, LD for an L-center): 
(III-I 8) 
When the amounts of D- and L-centers are equal, statistical expressions for polymer 
molecules obtained on one type of center are also applicable to the polymer as a 
whole. 
Usually for better understanding, polymer statistics are described as some variant of the 
Markoff chain process (depending on the stereoregulation mechanism). Peculiarities of the 
enantiomorphous mechanism can be made more clear if dyad formulation of a polymer chain

mmmrrmmmmmmmrrmmrmrmmmm 
It is evident that the probabilities of meso (isotactic) placements involving DD and LL pain, 
are not equal. Neither are probabilities for the two possible racemic (syndiotactic) place-
ments, DL and LD. If one takes these differences in probabilities into account and denotes 
sequences: DD = m', LL = m", DL = r', and LD = r", the chain segment presented above 
can be rewritten as 
nl' m' m' r' r"nl' m'm' m' m' m' m' r' r" m' nl' r' m" I'" m' m' m'm' 
Probabilities for different dyads in these chains are (using Eqns. 111-12, 111-16, and 111-17): for 
m', P;so; for m", I - P;so; for r', I - P;so; and for r", P;so' The transition probability matrix for 
the latter chain is

The matrix shows that from the probabilistic point of view the enantiomorphous control 
model corresponds to a Markoff chain of the first order, the four primitive events of which 
are m', mil, r', and 1'''.

As was described in Section III -2-b IR spectroscopic methods in the first approx-
imation give one the possibility to measure the fraction of monomer units belonging 
to sufficiently long stereoregular blocks. Thus the absorbance of a regularity band 
in a polymer IR spectrum, from the statistical point of view, is proportional to 
x(iso )n+l where n + 1 = jeff. The absorbance (A) of such a band is given by 
A = Kx(iso )n+l1 
where K is the absorption coefficient of the regularity band and I is the sample 
thickness. As was discussed in Section III-2-b, IR spectroscopic methods are usually 
normalized and use the internal standard technique. Thus the estimated isotacticity 
parameters are in effect the x(iso )n+1 values or x(iso )k/x(iso)m ratios. The following 
equations give the statistical meaning of various IR spectroscopic parameters used

These IR methods give one the possibility to estimate R values, i.e., the ratios of 
isotactic and syndiotactic addition constants. In some instances (poly-I-butene, 
poly-3-methyl-I-butene), corresponding Jeff values for analytical IR bands are 
unknown and the isotacticity parameters can be used only as empirical character-
istics of polymer isotacticity.

In {!rinciple, the statistical description of stereoregular polymer structure pro-
vides the possibility to compare the results of different methods employed for the 
measurement of polyolefin isotacticity, for example, NMR and IR methods. As was 
discussed in Section III-2-b, direct comparison of numerical values of isotacticity 

III-4: Statistics of Olefin Homopolymerization and Copolymerization

parameters obtained by different techniques has no physical basis and the only 
correct procedure is to compare R (or some related statistical parameters) cal-
culated from different spectral data. When making such comparisons two consider-
ations have to be kept in mind: 
(i) The precision of the R estimation is not high, especially for highly isotactic 
samples. For example, a typical value of the IR A998/A973 parameter for 
moderately isotactic polypropylene is 0.92-0.94, which corresponds to an R 
value range of 19-26, taking into account the uncertainty in the jeff estimation. 
Similarly, a mmmm pentad range of 88-90% corresponds to an R range of 
38.5-47. 
(ii) The precision of the two most important types of methods used for polyolefin 
stereo regularity measurements (NMR and IR) decreases when highly isotactic 
polymers are studied. The reasons for this decrease are different for the two 
methods. In the case ofIR methods, it is the influence of conformational defects 
on the spectra (increased sensitivity of IR parameters to the film preparation 
technique) and, in the case ofNMR methods, it is an insufficient signal-to-noise 
ratio for weak peaks of irregular sequences and the problems involved in precise 
comparison of these weak peaks with highly intense peaks of regular sequences. 
This explains the sometimes substantial differences noted between R values 
estimated from NMR and IR data which are presented in the following sections of 
this chapter. One example of such a comparison between R values is shown in Fig. 
III-14. Also included in this figure are values ofa secondary statistical parameter, 
the tacticity function T [59]

Chain End Control Mechanism. 
This type of stereo regulation mechanism is not character-
istic for isotactic polyolefins and it will be discussed very briefly. This model is of considerable 
importance for many other polymerization processes (radical, free-ionic, etc.) and has been 
elaborated in much detail [42, 175]. Applications of this model to olefin polymerization are 
probably restricted to soluble catalytic systems producing syndiotactic polypropylene. 
When stereoregularity of monomer addition to a growing chain is governed by the 
interactions between an approaching monomer molecule and the last unit of the growing 
chain, the following relationships between stereopropagation constants hold: 
kDD = kLL 
for isotactic monomer addition 
kDL = kLD 
for syndiotactic monomer addition 
In such cases (see Eqns. III-1O-III-15):

This simple statistical scheme corresponds to a Markoff chain of zero order (Bernoulli chain).

III: Stereospecificity of Heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta Catalysts 
In some cases of anionic vinyl polymerization a more complicated statistical scheme holds 
which takes into account a penultimate effect (the first-order Markoff chain) [42, 176, 177]. 
Corresponding expressions for distribution of monomer units in isotactic blocks are pre-
sented in Ref. [176] and those for different n-ads in Refs. [42] and [177].

Heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts can easily copolymerize different olefins with the 
formation of rubbery or partially crystalline products. The study of the copolymer structure 
is an important tool in the elucidation ofthe mechanism of stereospecific activity (see Section 
III-II). The quantitative approach to the description of the copolymer structure is based on 
copolymerization statistics. 
The statistics of usual binary copolymers is one of the most advanced concepts in polymer 
kinetics. All necessary expressions for the copolymer composition and monomer distribution 
in the case of the simple four-reaction scheme [175, 178], as well as for those for the 
penultimate effect [176, 179, 180] and the antepenultimate effect [181], were obtained by the 
kinetic method and by an approach based on the Markoff chain theory [182-184]. 
When examining binary copolymers obtained with heterogeneous stereospecific catalysts 
it is important to consider not only the effect of mixing the monomer units in the copolymer 
chain but also the effect of a catalytic system on the steric structure of monomer sequences in 
the copolymers. If one neglects penultimate and higher-order effects in the copolymerization 
of two olefin monomers Mt and M2 and assumes that the standard scheme of chain growth, 
similar to that described in the preceding section holds, the following set of 16 propagation 
reactions can be written:

Reactions 1-4 correspond to the stereospecific homo polymerization of M 1 and 
Reactions 9-12 to that ofM2 . 
General statistical expressions for this 16-reaction scheme are rather complex but 
they can be significantly simplified assuming two models of the stereocontrol 
mechanism described above. 
Enantiomorphous Control Mechanism. 
In accordance with the previous analysis of 
homopolymerization statistics the following relationships between different propagation 
constants hold 
Two stereospecificity parameters (stereo-reactivity ratios) are used: 
for the monomer Ml 
R' 
(III-45) 
for the monomer Mz 
(R' is not necessarily equal to R".) Consistent application of the enantiomorphous model 
gives the following correlations for the inter-monomer propagation reactions 
i.e., the stereocontrol of the addition of a given monomer to the chain ending with another

Similar expressions for the M2 unit distribution can be easily obtained from Eqns. 
1II-49-1II-52 by substituting r2 for r1, R" for R', and l/Ffor F. 
If one neglects the distribution of monomer units in stereosequences and examines the 
distribution of the units in chemical sequences or if a monomer has no side groups (a very 
important monomer ofthis type is ethylene) one can easily simplify Eqns. III-49-III-52 to the

Following are some important expressions for chemical and stereochemical n-ads employed 
in the NMR spectral analysis of olefin copolymers. All these expressions are normalized over 
the total amount of all units in a copolymer, both MI and M z. In these equations,z was 
substituted for 'Irzlrl. The equations are given for MI only. To obtain corresponding 
expressions for M2 one has to substitute R" for R', r2 for r1 , and IIFfor F.

If one compares all statistical expressions for binary copolymers presented above and the 
equation 
(III-58) 
which follows directly from Eqn. 111-46 describing copolymer composition [186] it is evident 
that all distribution functions depend on three parameters: the copolymer composition ratio 
f, the stereospecificity parameter of a catalyst R' (or R"), and the reactivity ratio product r 1 r 2. 
This conclusion is equivalent to a well-known statement that the distribution of chemical 
units in a copolymer chain (Eqns. III-53) depends only on the copolymer composition ratio! 
and the reactivity ratio product r1r2. The application of these statistical equations for the 
quantitative analysis of some olefin copolymers obtained with heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta 
catalysts is presented in Section III -11.

syndiotactic blocks of propylene-I-butene copolymers obtained with syndiospecific soluble 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts based on VCI4 [120]. Equations for chemical unit distribution in the 
case of the penultimate effect are given in Ref. [176] and methods for the statistical descrip-
tion of multi component copolymers are discussed in Refs. [191]-[193]. 

111-5: Parameters Characterizing the Stereoregulative Ability of Active Centers 
271 
III -5. 
Parameters Characterizing the Stereoregulative Ability of 
Active Centers 
Heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts contain active centers of various stereore-
gulative power. This phenomenon became evident after the very first polymeriza-
tion experiments with these catalysts. Thus, fractionation of polypropylene sam-
ples even with the application of a single solvent (usually with n-heptane, the same 
solvent that was initially used as the polymerization medium) easily enables one to 
separate these products into three fractions which differ in both molecular weight 
and stereoregularity: 
(i) the fraction soluble in n-heptane at room temperature which is usually amor-
phous and is referred to as "atactic," 
(ii) the fraction insoluble in cold n-heptane but soluble in boiling n-heptane-the 
"stereo block" fraction, 
(iii) the fraction insoluble in boiling n-heptane-the "isotactic" fraction. 
In spite of the evident arbitrary nature of such division (application of a single 
solvent, the choice of fractionation temperatures), this fractionation procedure 
became the main method of polypropylene stereo regularity estimation and was also 
applied with minor modifications (change of solvent) for the characterization of 
other polyolefins. Application of this method for more than twenty years has 
demonstrated its undeniable usefulness and has justified its further use. Indeed, it 
easily enables one to separate three important constituents of any stereoregular 
poly olefin; its amorphous, semicrystalline, and highly crystalline fractions. For this 
reason the fractionation method remains one of the most popular procedures for 
stereoregularity estimation. 
However, a more detailed analysis reveals that it is not free from significant 
shortcomings which become an obstacle as far as mechanistic problems are con-
cerned. Two main deficiencies of the fractionation procedure are: 
(i) More complicated fractionation studies showed that the so-called "atactic'; and 
"stereo block" fractions are not homogeneous in a steric sense and can be 
further divided into sub-fractions of various molecular weight and stereore-
gularity. This subject is treated in detail in Chapter IV. In brief, nascent olefin 
polymers usually consist of many components with different stereoregularity. 
This allows one to qualify distribution of polymer fractions with respect to 
stereo regularity as quasi-continuous. On the other hand, "isotactic" polypro-
pylene fractions (insoluble in boiling n-heptane) usually cannot be further 
subdivided into fractions of different stereoregularity (see Section IV-I). Thus, 
the fraction of a polymer that is insoluble in boiling heptane remains an 
objective parameter characterizing polymer stereoregularity and it will be used 
in the subsequent discussion. 
(ii) According to the definition above, all polypropylene fractions insoluble in 
boiling n-heptane are regarded as identical, perfectly isotactic products. How-

ever, NMR and IR data easily demonstrate that this is not true: different 
"isotactic" fractions of polyolefins obtained with different catalysts have dis-
tinctly different isotacticity parameters (see next sections of this chapter). 
Figure III -15 schematically shows the distribution curve for some "stereore-
gular" polymer: the kinetic stereoreactivity parameter l/R = kSyndio/kiSO (see Sec-
tion III-4-a, Eqn. III-I8) versus the cumulative weight of the fractions. Experi-
mental data confimiing such dependences are presented in Section IV-I. It is clear 
from this figure that two independent stereochemical parameters can be defined 
which characterize the stereospecificity of any heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta 
catalyst. 
The first parameter is the minimum l/R value (or the maximum R = kiso/ksyndio 
value) which corresponds to the maximum stereoregulative power of the most 
isospecific active centers on the catalyst surface. R.;,ax can be approximately es-
timated as the R value for the polypropylene fraction insoluble in boiling n-heptane 
or n-octane (see Section IV-I). 
The minimum (l/R) value for polypropylene is always higher than 0, i.e., no 
heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalyst can produce perfectly isotactic polypro-
pylene (see following sections). On the other hand, similar fractions of polystyrene 
show no signs of irregularity in their 13C-NMR spectra [85], indicating that the 
stereoregulative power of the polymerization centers depends on the type of olefin 
also. R.nax characterizes the limit of the stereoregulative properties of a particular 
catalyst and it is directly related to such catalyst parameters as the transition metal 
type, properties of the organometallic compound, etc. 
The second important independent parameter characterizing a catalytic system is 
the fraction of polymer exhibiting these limiting stereoregular properties. This value 

111-6: Effect of Transition Metal Compounds on Catalyst Stereospecificity 
273 
can be roughly estimated as the weight of the fraction insoluble in a particular 
solvent under particular conditions (for example, the polypropylene fraction insol-
uble in boiling n-heptane). This second parameter characterizes the distribution of 
active centers with respect to their stereospecificity: the property which ideally 
would be described by a distribution curve like that in Fig. III-IS. This fraction 
content cannot be unambiguously correlated with such catalyst parameters as 
structural properties of catalyst components because the distribution of active 
centers with respect to their stereospecificity depends not only on the characteristics 
of the components but on the method of catalyst preparation, the conditions of 
component interaction, and other polymerization variables as well. 
Both parameters, R.nax and the fraction composition, are independent of each 
other, the former being the measure of the limiting stereospecificity of the active 
centers, and the second, a measure of the uniformity of active center specificity. For 
this reason a careful distinction is necessary between these two parameters when 
examination is made of catalyst properties which determine them. 
One vivid example demonstrating the importance of this distinction is found 
when propylene is polymerized with the TiCI4/MgCI2-AlEt3 catalyst. At 60-70Â°C 
only ca. 50% of the polymer is insoluble in boiling n-heptane [194, 195]. Modifica-
tion of this catalyst with ethyl benzoate dramatically improves its performance: the 
fraction of boiling heptane-insoluble polymer increases typically to 90-95% [194]. 
However, the properties of these two insoluble fractions are very similar indicating a 
similar stereoregulative power for most of the isospecific centers. This means that 
ethyl benzoate, while being a very effective poison for aspecific centers, has virtually 
no modifying effect on the limiting isoregulative ability of the polymerization 
centers in this catalyst. 
Finally it should be noted that in some papers dealing with the stereospecific 
polymerization of olefins, use is made of different average spectroscopic parameters 
(usually IR or NMR) determined for "whole" unfractionated polyolefins. As is 
evident from Fig. III-IS, such average polymer characteristics always represent 
some integral properties of a polymer that combine both Rmax and the fraction 
composition of the polymer. Quantitative definition of these integrated parameters 
is presented in Chapter IV. It is clear that extreme caution is necessary when such 
integral parameters are correlated with the catalyst structure. 
111-6. 
Effect of Transition Metal Compounds on Catalyst 
Stereospecificity 
As was discussed in the previous section the most rational procedure for correlation 
of the stereo regulative ability of active centers and the structure of transition metal 
halides MXn is the comparison of the limiting kinetic stereoregularity parameters 
R.nax for the most regular fractions of -the polyolefins obtained with these com-
pounds. This was done independently by different authors with the application of 
the two most important spectroscopic methods, NMR and IR.

III-4 contains some data for polypropylene obtained with the MCln-AlEt3 catalytic 
systems at 70Â°C in heptane or liquid monomer media. The first five examples 
correspond to propylene polymerization with solids having the same lattice type: 
stacks of elementary sandwich-like sheets, each containing one layer of transition 
metal atoms arranged in regular hexagons of graphite-like structure surrounded by 
two layers of hexagonally packed chlorine atoms (see Fig. II-I). The parameters of 
the hexagonal cell as well as the M-CI and M-M (CI-Cl) distances for these 
crystals were given in Table II-I. It follows from the data of Table III-4 that the 
limiting stereo regulative power of the catalytic systems tested decreases in the order: 
This order is close to the order of the decrease in M-M and CI-CI distance in the 
MCI3 lattice (Table II-I). 
13C-NMR data for the MCI3-AlEt2 CI systems (propylene polymerization at 
15Â°C) are presented in Table III-5 (from Ref. [166]). 
If one takes into account that the presence of rrrr pentads in the first polypropyl-
ene sample shown in Table III-5 is most probably connected with the presence of 
partially syndiotactic polypropylene (see discussion of this problem in Section IV-I) 
and renormalizes the pentad distribution for the sample to exclude these pentads, 
the mmmm pentad content increases to 89.5% and the corresponding kiso/ksyndiO 
ratio increases to ca. 45 (presented in parentheses in Table III-5). The NMR-based 
order of the limiting catalyst stereospecificity is: 
Thus, reasonable agreement exists between the IR and NMR data in the conclu-
sion that VCl3-based catalysts produce less isospecific centers than those based on 
TiCI 3 whereas no agreement exists about the relative isospecificity of TiCI3- and 
CrCl3-based centers. The differences in the organoaluminum compound type and in 
polymerization temperature can apparently explain this controversy. 
The principal difference between the stereo regularity of the fractions insoluble in 
boiling n-heptane exists also for poly-3-methyl-l-butene samples obtained with the 
TiCI 3- and VClrbased catalysts [145]-see Table 111-6.

On the other hand, the data presented in Tables lIlA, II1-5, and 11I-6 show that 
the differences between the limiting stereoregulative ability of different TiCl3 types 
((X, {J, and b) are relatively insignificant. {J-TiCI3 usually produces a little less 
isotactic polymer-see Table II1-4 and Ref. [13]. As was described in Section II-I-a, 
(X-TiCI3 and b-TiC13 have stacked layered structures whereas {J-TiCI3 has a specific 
crystal structure consisting oflinear polymeric (TiCI3)n fragments. The similarity in 
the limiting stereospecificity of all these TiCl3 types leads to the assumption that the 
stereoregulation process of olefin polymerization with these catalysts is confined to 
some relatively small regions on the catalyst surface and only weakly depends on the 
three-dimensional structure of the crystals. 
The comparison of transition metals in different valence states is restricted to 
data on TiCl3 and TiCI2 â¢ Infrared data for the catalysts are compared in Table lIlA 
(pure TiCI2 , TiCI2-AlEt2CI, and b-TiCI3-AlEt2Cl) and NMR data for these 
systems are given in Table 11I-7 (from Ref. [171]). 
On one hand, the IR data in Table III -4 indicate definite differences between pure 
TiCl2 and TiCl3-based systems which were related to the assumption that, in the last 
case the active centers are most probably situated on the vacancies on the TiCl2 
lateral faces and have a structure different from that of the TiCl3 centers [132] (see 
discussion in Section V-4). Addition of AlEt2CI produces new polymerization 
centers with improved performance resulting in a general increase of polymer 
stereoregularity. On the other hand, the comparison of NMR data [171] in Table 
II1-7 with NMR data for polypropylene obtained with TiCl3-based systems (see 
Table II1-5) shows no difference between these catalytic systems. One possible 
explanation of this apparent controversy is that the comparison was made between 
polymer samples obtained at different temperatures, 15Â°C for data shown in Table 
11I-5 and 70Â°C for data shown in Table II1-7, as well as with relatively low precision 
of pentad content evaluation in rather "noisy" 13C-NMR spectra in Ref. [171]. The 
problem becomes even more complicated if one takes into account that, according 
to current assumptions, the active centers of TiCIz-based catalysts are in fact Ti3+ 
centers produced during the course of oxidative addition of monomer to TiC12 
[196]. 
Table II1-8(A) contains some IR stereoregularity parameters of polypropylene 
obtained with two series of catalysts, TiCI3-TiBr3-TiI3 and VCI3-VBr3, all in

combination with AlEt3. The isotacticities of the n-heptane-insoluble fractions 
remain virtually unchanged for the TiCI3- TiBr3- TiI3 5 series but improve after 
substitution ofCI by Br in the V-based catalysts. Interesting information on doping 
of the surface of TiCl3 by Br and I was presented in Refs. [197] and [198]. When 
conventional l5-TiCI3 is treated by AII3, AlEtIz, AlEtzI, AlBr3, AlEtBrz, AlEtzBr, 
or BBr 3 in heptane suspension at 40Â°C [198] and is subsequently separated from the 
additives, the chlorine atoms on the TiCl3 surface are partially substituted by 
bromine or iodine atoms so that the [I] : [Ti] ratio, for example, exceeds 0.5% of all 
Ti atoms in the sample. Taking into account the catalyst surface area (17 mZ/g), this 
corresponds to a [I] : [Ti]surface ratio of ~ 0.2. The catalytic activity of these treated 
TiCl3 samples is roughly the same as that of the initial TiCl3 but the treatment 
5 Similar isotacticities for boiling n-heptane-insoluble fractions were reported also for polypropylene 
obtained with the TiC13-AIMe3 and TiI3-AlMe3 systems [264].

significantly improves the stereoregulative power of the systems. A detailed NMR 
study of polymers formed under similar conditions showed [10] (see Table III-8(B)) 
that not only the relative amount of highly isotactic fraction in the total polymer 
increased but the stereoregularity of these fractions was also improved significantly. 
Thus it can be stated that the treatment of TiCl3 with AlEtnX 3 - n (X = Br, I; n 
= 0-2) at relatively low temperatures makes it possible to obtain practically pure 
(97-99%) and nearly perfectly isotactic polyolefins [10, 199] (see also next section). 
Such polymers are characterized by extremely high crystallinity (up to 78-79% for 
polypropylene) and by very high melting points (l77Â°C for polypropylene, 136Â°C 
for poly-I-butene) [200]. Similarly, treatment of a-TiC13 with liquid TiCl3I at 70Â°C 
[197] produces a catalyst with noticebly improved isospecificity. 
The analysis of the body of data presented in this section unambiguously 
demonstrates that the structural parameters of transition metal derivatives in the 
catalytic systems have a significant influence on the isospecificity of active centers. 
However, the exact nature of these effects is not clear. Several possibilities can be 
envisaged: 
(i) Optimum geometrical conditions in the vicinity of the centers may exist corre-
sponding to the M-X distance ca. 2.50 A. A decrease in the distance brings 
about reduction of centers' isospecificity (in CrCI3, VCI3, or FeCl3-see Table 
III-4) whereas an increase of the distance (in TiBr3 and TiI3-see Table III-8-
(A)) has no appreciable effect on the center performance. 
(ii) Variations in the type of transition metal or halogen atoms in MX3 are 
accompanied by the changes in the M-X bond polarities and in the metal atom 
charges. These changes can influence energies of the metal-olefin coordination 
complexes (which are formed prior to olefin addition to polymer chains-see 
Chapter V) as well as geometry of the complexes. 
(iii) Variations in the types of transition metal and halogen atoms in MX3, as well 
as doping of TiCl3 with Br or I, can influence interactions between MX3 and 
organometallic compounds and the structure of active centers. 
A more detailed study of different MX3 series is necessary to elucidate the problem.

Effect of Organometallic Compounds on Catalyst 
Stereospecificity 
The study of the influence of the organometallic co-catalysts on polyolefin stereore-
gularity was historically one of the principal areas where confusion in definitions of 
stereospecificity (discussed in Section III-5) resulted in many controversial 
conclusions. 
If one uses extraction methods to characterize stereoregularity of polypropylene 
obtained with a-TiCI3-based systems (Table III-9) one readily concludes that the 
influence of the organometallic compound type on polypropylene isotacticity is

very marked-catalyst stereospecificity increases as the ionic radius of the metal 
decreases. The evident conclusion from these data is that the organometallic com-
ponent of a Ziegler-Natta catalyst is the vital component of the active center and 
strongly influences its stereo regulative power [1]. However, measurements of the 
crystallinity of polypropylene fractions by X-ray and IR methods reveal that this 
correlation is artificial to a significant degree and that polyolefin fractionation is a 
complex process that is determined not only by polymer stereo regularity but by 
polymer molecular weight as well. In particular, the use of ZnEt2 as a co-catalyst 
results mostly in a molecular weight decrease rather than in a deterioration of 
catalyst stereospecificity-see Table III -10. In addition, the inverse correlation 
between extraction parameter and metal ionic radius does not hold in the case of 
VCl3-based systems [203]-see Table III-9. 
The comparison of IR stereoregularity parameters for unfractionated polypro-
pylene samples obtained with C(-TiCI3-based systems (Table III-ll) confirms that 
the stereo regulative ability of the active centers of C(-TiCI3-MEtn catalytic systems 
hardly depends on the MEtn type [201, 202, 204]. This conclusion does not mean, of 
course, that organometallic compounds do not participate in the active center 
structure at all but merely that their influence on the stereo regulation process is 
small. 
The influence of the nature of R in AIR3 on the catalyst stereospecific character-
istics is also insignificant. Judging by the extraction method, catalyst stereospeci-
ficity decreases in the following order [206, 207]: Et (79.4% insoluble in boiling 
n-heptane) > i-Bu (74.5%) > n-Pr (71.8%) > Ph (65.4%) > n-C6H13 (64.0%) 
> C16H 33 (59.0%). However, if one compares the IR stereo regularity parameters 
of the unfractionated polymers the difference becomes insignificant (Table III-12) 
and when one compares IR isotacticity parameters for the polypropylene fractions 
insoluble in boiling n-heptane, the difference between AlEt3 and Ali-Bu3 virtually

vanishes (Table 111-13). Thus, it can be concluded that the R type in AIR3 influences 
the distribution of active centers with respect to their stereospecificity (which is 
reflected in fractionation data) but does not significantly influence the stereoregula-
tive power of the most stereospecific centers on the rx-TiC13 surface. 
A similar situation exists when One of the R groups in AlEt3 is substituted 
by a halogen atom. The composition of polypropylene obtained with the rx-
TiC13-AlEt2X system markedly depends on the nature of X [200, 208, 209] with the 
percentage of boiling n-heptane-insoluble fraction decreasing in the order AIEt2I 
(98-97%) AlEt2Br ~ AlEt2SPh (95%) > AlEt2SePh (94%) > AlEt2Cl (93091 %) 
> AlEt2F (83%) ~ AlEt3 (83%). However, comparison of IR stereoregularity 
parameters of the fractions insoluble in boiling n-heptane in the case of polypro-
pylene samples obtained with the rx-TiC13-AlR2X and b-TiClc AlR2X systems re-
vealed (see Table 111-14) that, at least in two cases, AlEt3 and AlEt2Cl, the limiting 
stereoregulative properties of the catalysts do not depend on the presence of halogen 
atoms in the organometallic compound. Similar results were obtained when NMR 
stereo regularity parameters were compared for polypropylene obtained with 15-
TiC13-AlEt3 and b-TiC13-AlEt2Cl [10] (see Table III-I 5) and for polypropylene 
obtained with the YC14-AlEt2X catalytic system (X = Et, Cl) at 41Â°C where the 
most probable catalyst is YC12 [210]. 
As for the improved performance of the rx-TiC13-AIMe2I catalytic system (Table 
111-14) it apparently has the same origin as that described in Section 111-6: the 
halogen atom exchange between rx-TiC13 and AlMe2I produces new, chemically 
modified active centers which are characterized by nearly perfect stereospecificity 
(compare with Table III-8).

Temperature Effect on Catalyst Stereospecificity and the 
Reaction Pathway of the Propagation Step 
The significance of the stereospecificity-temperature dependence is twofold: it 
throws light on the reaction pathway profile of the isospecific olefin polymerization 
and provides researchers with data on optimum synthesis temperature. 
If extraction methods are used for the evaluation of polypropylene stereoregular-
ity the conclusion is unanimous: the isotactic fraction content either remains 
approximately constant or it steadily declines with temperature, depending on the 
temperature range and the catalytic system used [159, 206, 211]. The same is true if 
one examines IR parameters of unfractionated polypropylene samples: they too 
remain approximately constant or decrease with temperature (See Tables 111-16, 
III-17). The analysis of the data in Table III-16, as well as some related data [210,

case of catalytic systems especially prone to reduction reactions (like [)-
TiCI3-AIEt3), it occurs at 70Â°C [212]. 
However, the approach outlined in Section III-5 gives a different picture. Tables 
III-IS and III-19 contain data on polypropylene stereo regularity for samples ob-
tained with different catalytic systems over a wide temperature range [213]. It can be 
seen that, as far as fractionation data are concerned, the results presented in these 
tables confirm the above conclusion: the amount of the fraction insoluble in boiling 
n-heptane decreases with temperature, especially in the high temperature region. On 
the other hand, the data on the stereoregularity of these fractions reveal a more 
complex and unexpected picture. The stereoregularity parameters go through a 
weakly pronounced minimum for the samples obtained in the 30-50Â°C range

The observed phenomena cannot be explained by the temperature effect on 
molecular weight. A comparison of samples obtained at 30Â°, 70Â°, and 90Â°C with

Table III -18) confirms an increase ofthe limiting stereospecificity with temperature. 
Catalyst aging at high temperature does not influence the limiting stereo regulative 
ability either (see data for 50Â°C in Table 111-19), i.e., the stereo regularity parameters 
of the most isotactic fractions depend on the synthesis temperature rather than on 
the previous history of the catalyst. 
The data presented in Table 111-18 and 111-19 allow discrimination between two 
alternative kinetic schemes for polyolefin growth on heterogeneous catalysts which 
cannot be distinguished by usual kinetic approaches (see Section 11-8). 
The simplest one-stage mechanism for the propagation step which does not take 
into account preliminary monomer coordination is (the same as in Scheme 111-9):

zation with typical heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts (see Tables III-18 and

addition to a polymer chain includes two consecutive processes (see Section 
II-8)-monomer coordination and its addition to a polymer chain end-which 
are written below for a general case of monomer addition to a catalytic center of 
the D type (irrespectively ofthe structure of the last unit in the growing chain which 
is characteristic for the enantiomorphous mechanism) [213, 214]:

In this scheme MD and ML in the transition coordination complexes I and II stand 
for monomers of the D-type (preferential) and L-type (minor) at coordination 
positions on the D-type active center, i.e., those coordination types which eventually 
will result in D- or L-type monomer addition to a polymer. The structures of these 
two coordination complexes are discussed in Chapter V.

rangement reaction (A3 :;:; 1013). As to the interrelations between the E values, the 
estimation [215] predicts that (EISO - EiyndiO) is a negative value and is equal to a few 
kcal/mol. Another qualitative scheme ofthe reaction pathway [214] is based on the 
assumption that A.Gf < A.Gj for both isotactic and syndiotactic routes, (A.G1)iso 
< (A.GDsyndio (as in Ref. [215]), (A.Gl)syndio < (A.Gl)iso, and A.A.Gt = (A.Gj)Syndio 
- (A.Gj)iso ::::= 2.5 kcal/mol which ensures an m-content in a polymer of the order of 
0.98. 
The semiquantitative data for the kiso/ksyndio-temperature dependence presented 
in Fig. III-16 for two catalytic systems give one the possibility for a new estimation 
of the activation parameters involved. The approximate computer simulation of the 
R-Tdependence (Eqn. 1II-69) for the 0(-TiC13-AlEt3 system gives [213] A~so/A~yndiO 
= 1.5; Â£IsO - EiyndiO = -3.5 kcal/mol; Aindio/AjyndiO = 1.5 x 104 ; A~so/A;sO = 10; 
Erndio - E3yndio = 6.0 kcal/mol; mso - mso = -0.9 kcal/mol. The R-T depen-
dence corresponding to these estimations is presented in Fig. III-16 (the dashed 
line). As can be seen from the comparison of the experimental and calculated R-T 
dependencies, only qualitative agreement was achieved. The differences between the 
two curves are especially pronounced in the high temperature region. Nevertheless, 
some interesting relations were revealed-see Fig. III-17. 
The EIso - EiyndiO value is, as was formerly proposed [215], a negative value of a 
few kcaljmol which determines the preferential iso-coordination of a monomer on 
an isospecific active center, i.e., coordination which, in the case of aD-center, 
eventually results in the formation of a D-isotactic polymer chain. 
On the other hand, the insertion step itself proceeds more easily after syndio-
coordination of a monomer, i.e, the iso-complex I in Scheme 1II-66 is possibly more 
stable with respect to its rearrangement in step 3 than the syndio-complex. The 
dissociation reaction 2 in scheme III-66 for the syndio-complex is much more 
favored sterically than that of the iso-complex judging by the ratios of the pre-
exponential factors. The existence of the minimum on the R - T curve (Fig. III -16) is 
thus the result of a complex interplay of activation and entropy factors of two 
parallel routes, iso- and syndio-monomer addition to a chain. 
The similarity between the R versus T curves for both catalytic systems studied, 
0(-TiC13-AlEt3 and VC13-AlEt3 , suggests that they operate by idential mechanisms

in spite of the fact that the stereo regulative power of the VCl3-based catalyst is 
always lower than that of the oc-TiCI3-based catalyst (compare with Section 
III-6). 
All data presented above are related to stable catalytic systems in which observed 
stereospecificity changes can be safely attributed to a real effect of temperature on 
the polymerization step. Quite a different situation can be found when one examines 
the so-called "pseudo-homogeneous" systems TiCI4-AlEt2CI, VClc AlEt2CI, 
VOCI3-AlEt2CI, etc. In such cases temperature strongly effects not only polymeri-
zation steps but also the structure of the catalytically active species. A demonstra-
tive example of such dependence was presented in Ref. [21] where data were given 
for polypropylene obtained with the VCl4 - AlEt2 CI system over a wide temperature 
range ( - 78Â° to + 41Â°C). As the temperature is raised from - 78Â°C this catalytic 
system goes through three different stages. From - 78Â°C to - 30Â°C the catalyst is 
homogeneous and produces highly syndiotactic polymer. From - 20Â° to + 20Â°C 
the catalyst is heterogeneous and produces virtually atactic polypropylene with a 
large amount of monomer inversions in polymer chains (see Table III-I). Above 
+ 20Â°C a second heterogeneous catalyst is formed that produces mildly isotactic 
polypropylene (at 41Â°C the mm triad content in the unfractionated polymer is 0.59, 
i.e., kiso/ksyndio ~ 5), similar to that obtained with the VCl3-based systems but 
having a significant amount of monomer inversions in the polymer chains. The 
change in the nature of the active center for this catalytic system with temperature 
manifests itself also in a change of polymer molecular weight distribution [216]. 
The VOCI3-Ali-Bu3 catalytic system in the -100-+20Â°C temperature range 
produces polypropylene with a wide distribution on stereoregularity (see Chapter 
IV). The average degree of stereo regularity is rather low and it slowly decreases as 
temperature increases (Table 1II-20). 
111-9. 
Role of Catalyst Modification 
The literature on Ziegler-Natta catalysis is abundant with data on the modification 
ofthe catalysts. The targets of the modification are various: an increase in catalyst 
activity, improvement of their stereoregulative ability, the enhancement of their 
stability, change of the polymer granular composition, etc. There are four main

catalyst stereospecificity) are also similar for these samples. 
approaches to the modification of these catalysts: 
(i) Grinding of MCI3 , 
(ii) Promotion of the catalysts with different organic substances, 
(iii) Promotion of the catalysts with inorganic substances, 
(iv) Preparation of supported catalysts. 
A more detailed description of these modification methods as well as of the 
polymerization kinetics observed with the modified catalysts is presented in Chap-
ters 1 and II. The purpose ofthe following discussion is to compare the stereospeci-
ficity of different modified catalysts and their unmodified analogues. 
III-9-a. Catalyst Grinding 
TiCl3 grinding is one of the principal methods for increasing the activity of 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts. Grinding processes (both dry and wet procedures) have 
great commercial significance. Some relevant data can be found in [217] and in 
Section 1I-1-b of this book. When conventional 0(-TiCl3 samples are ground without 
a solvent their surface area can be increased from a few m2 / g up to 40-60 m 2 /g [217] 
and even to 150 m2/g [218]. This results in a proportional increase of the catalyst 
activity toward olefin polymerization (see Section 11-6). This grinding usually leads 
to an increase of polymer nonuniformity with respect to stereoregularity, for 
example, to the growth of polypropylene fractions soluble in cold and boiling n-
heptane, probably due to an increase in the amount of defects on the catalyst 
surface. However, when the unfractionated samples with similar amounts of these 
soluble fractions are compared (Table 111-21) their IR stereoregularity parameters 
are close, i.e., the grinding process does not influence the properties of the active 
centers formed in the course of the subsequent interaction of organometallic com-
pounds with the ground samples.

Addition of organic compounds (usually electron donors) to TiCl3 sometimes 
results in a substantial increase in its catalytic activity and in the improvement of 
polyolefin steric composition [219-222]. For this reason such organic compounds 
as amines (aliphatic and aromatic), urea derivatives, ethers, esters, etc., are often 
used for catalyst treatment before the admittance of an organometallic compound. 
The treatment conditions-temperature, solvent, treatment duration, etc.-vary 
depending on the nature of the organic compound and the type of TiCI3 . Most of 
the available data can be found in patents which usually do not contain any 
information on the catalyst stereospecificity apart from polymer fractionation. 
Some examples presented in Table III-22 are related to the interaction of IX-TiCI 3 
with amines and ureas [212]. In these cases, the best results were obtained at a TiCI3 : 
donor ratio close to 1 and were attributed to the formation of a complex between the 
reagent and TiCI3 , altering the crystal structure of TiCl 3 . 
It can be concluded from these data that the addition of organic promoters 
usually reduces drastically the amount of amorphous fraction in polypropylene but 
in many cases it does not influence the limiting stereo regulative power of the best 
isospecific centers in these catalysts. Such influence was found only in b-TiCI3-Et3N 
and IX-TiCl3-thiourea complexes producing polypropylene of increased stereo-
regularity. 

292 
III: Stereospecificity of Heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta Catalysts 
A similar effect was discovered for TiCI4/MgCI2 supported catalysts in the 
presence of AlEt3: addition of aromatic esters to the co-catalyst sharply reduced the 
amount of stereoirregular polypropylene (from", 50 to 3-5%) but the stereoregular-
ity of the heptane-insoluble fractions in these polymers hardly differed from that for 
similar fractions of polymers produced with unmodified systems. 
ill-9-c. 
Inorganic Promoters 
Catalyst modifications by different metal halides can, in principle, be carried out by 
co-grinding techniques, by reduction of TiC14 or VCl4 with different metals, or by 
reduction of these substances with various organometallic compounds. One of the 
best known and most important examples of such modification is the commercial 
form of ~-TiCl3 usually produced by TiCl4 reduction with Al and subsequent 
grinding, and containing up to 33% AICI3. Data presented in Table III-4 indicate 
that such modification does not change the limiting stereospecificity of the catalyst's 
polymerization centers to any significant extent. 
Another example of such modification is a heterogeneous catalyst obtained by 
the interaction of TiCl4 and n-CsH17MgBr [224]. The interaction, which is carried 
out in isooctane medium for 48 h, followed by heating of the mixture in decalin at 
150Â°C, results in the formation of the modified P-TiCI3 structure. This solid residue, 
in combination with Ali-Bu3 or AI(CsH17h, readily polymerizes propylene in the 
40-70Â°C temperature range. The NMR and IR stereo regularity parameters of these 
polymers (obtained in isooctane at 40Â°C) are compared in Table III-23 with the 
same parameters for usual commercial polypropylene samples. 
In spite ofa significant scatter of the data presented in Table III-23, it can be seen 
that the stereoregularity parameters of commercial polypropylene samples (virtu-
ally insoluble in heptane) and the heptane-insoluble fractions of the polymers 
obtained with Mg-modifiedcatalysts are in the same range, which is not surprising 
when one takes into account that the mixed "Ti-Mg" systems are, in effect, highly 
dispersed TiCl3 mechanically mixed with Mg compounds [224]. 
llI-9-d. 
Supported Ziegler-Natta Catalysts 
Several different methods used for the preparation of supported Ziegler-Natta 
catalysts were discussed in Section II-I-c. These catalysts can be roughly divided 
into two major groups: those tailored for the manufacture of polyethylene and those 
for the manufacture of polypropylene. Catalysts of the first group usually contain 
inert supports of high specific surface area, irrespective of their crystal structure: 
such substances as inorganic oxides (usually MgO, Si02 , A120 3, etc.) or polyolefin 
powders [225, 226]. The first attempts to use these catalysts for the polymerization 
of propylene and other higher olefins usually failed: polymerization rates were low 
and the proportion of crystalline polymer in the polymerization products was low 
also. Similarly unsatisfactory results were obtained with such supports as Mg(OHh 
and Mg(OH)CI containing chemically bound TiCl4 [225, 226, 227].

a Experimental data are from Ref. [231]. 
Much more promising results were obtained with inert suppports structurally 
similar to TiC13 and VC13 (most frequently MgCl2) [225, 226, 228-230]-see 
Section II-I-c. The absolute majority of the earlier publications concerned with 
supported Ziegler-Natta catalysts lacked any information about the structural 
features of the polypropylene formed apart from the fractionation of the products. 
One of the rare exceptions [231] was the description of catalysts obtained by the 
interaction ofTiC14 with different supports in heptane at 98Â°C without any reducing 
agent. These products were used in combination with AlEt3 for propylene poly-
merization in heptane at 50Â°C. Some results can be found in Table 1II-24. 
Most supports, with the exception of MgC12 and possibly FeC13, give catalysts 
producing predominantly amorphous polypropylene of low regularity.6 Careful 
study of different Mg derivatives, the first candidates for inert supports ofTi-based 
catalysts, showed that TiC14 supported even on the best of them, Mg(OH)Cl and 
crystalline Mg(OH)2, in combination with AlEt3 produces polypropylene with IR 
isotacticity parameters lower than those of polypropylene samples obtained with 
solid CrC13 (65%) or TiC13 (70%). [231]. 
Subsequent development of the catalysts including MgC12 as a support and TiC14 
as the source of active species formed in the presence of combinations of AlEt3 and 
aromatic esters made it possible to obtain highly active catalysts producing polypro-
pylene with a high content of crystalline fraction (94-97%) [225, 230]-see Section 
6 CrCI3 cannot be regarded as a true support because in combination with AlEt3 it can polymerise 
propylene to an isotactic polymer even without addition of TiCI4 -see Table III -4.

â¢ Polymerization conditions: 60Â°C in n-decane, at propylene pressure = 1 atm [232). 
II-I-c. NMR and IR stereoregularity parameters of these crystalline fractions are 
virtually the same as those for similar polypropylene fractions obtained with TiCI3-
based catalysts [172, 232] (compare Tables III-5 and III-25), indicating that these 
inorganic supports have no effect on the stereoregulating ability of active centers 
with the highest stereospecificity. 
Finally it should be noted that some Ti-containing systems which cannot form 
TiCI3, such as Ti(OC3H7)cAlEt3, pure Ti(CH2C6Hs)4' Zr(CH2C6Hs)4, (n-
CsHs)TiMe3, etc., can produce isotactic polypropylene in a limited volume when 
they are supported on inert solids (Si02 , A120 3, CoCi2 , Mg(OH)CI) [226, 233] 
whereas in the unsupported state they either produce amorphous polypropylene 
only (Ti(OC3H7)cAlEt3 at 70-80Â°C, [205]) or do not polymerize propylene at all 
(Ti(CH2C6Hs)4, etc. [226, 233]). According to ESR data [226, 233] the active 
centers of such supported catalysts contain various Ti3+ complexes.

Stereoselective and Stereoelective Olefin Polymerization 
Among the various olefins which can be converted to isotactic polymers by hetero-
geneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts with isotactic polymer formation there exist some 
olefins that contain asymmetric carbon atoms in their alkyl groups. Whereas kinetic 
characteristics of their polymerization are trivial, the presence of asymmetric car-
bon atoms in their side groups has helped to reveal some important additional 
features of the polymerization mechanism: ability of polymerization centers to 
"feel" the type of this asymmetric carbon atom [168, 214]. 
Let us examine a polymerization scheme involving an ex-olefin containing an 
asymmetric carbon atom in its alkyl group. If this monomer is obtained by some 

296

standard chemical method (without the separation of enantiomorphic molecules) it 
exists as an equimolar mixture of two enantiomers with different absolute configu-
rations of the asymmetric carbon atom (CH 2=CHR* and CH2=CHS* enan-
tiomers) giving correspondingly-CH2-CHR*- and -CH2-CHS*- mono-
mer units in a polymer chain. When this equimolar and optically inactive (racemic) 
mixture is polymerized with some catalyst two alternative limiting possibilities exist 
concerning the distribution of monomer units in the resulting polymer chains, viz.:

In the first case the polymerization product consists of a racemic mixture of two 
different homopolymers (both isotactic if the catalyst is some heterogeneous 
Ziegler-Natta catalyst). These two types of macromolecules most probably will co-
crystallize, but in principle they can be separated into two polymer fractions with 
the same physical characteristics but with opposite signs of optical rotation in 
solution. Such a polymerization of the racemic mixture of optically active mono-
mers has been termed" stereospecific stereoselective" polymerization. (No straight-
forward correlation exists between the signs of optical rotation and the absolute 
stereoconfigurations of monomers and polymers. For example, (-)(S)-4-methyl-
l-hexene polymerizes with Ziegler-Natta catalysts of form isotactic ( + ) (S)-poly-
4-methyl-I-hexene, whereas (+ )(S)-3,7-dimethyl-I-octene produces isotactic 
( +) (S)poly-3, 7-dimethyl-I-octene [234]). 
The second route in Scheme III-70 corresponds to the formation of a random 
copolymer containing both comonomers in virtually equal amounts. 7 No separ-
ation technique can produce fractions of this copolymer exhibiting any optical 
rotation in solution. The ability of such copolymers to form crystals will depend on 
the nature of their side groups. 
The crucial test for distinguishing between these two alternative possibilities of enant-
iomorphous olefin polymerization involves macromolecule separation. Since ptae~cally all 
physical properties of enantiomorphous R* and S* homopolymers in Scheme 111-70 are 
identical, the only plausible method for their separation is to use some optically active 
polymeric sorbent in the hope that its ability to interact with the R*- and S*-homopolymers 
will be different. Two such separation techniques were developed [237, 238]: the solvent 
extraction procedure with the application of an insoluble crystalline support, poly-S*-3-
7In principle, the amounts of R* and S* monomeric units in every copolymer molecule cannot be 
strictly equal due to the statistical nature of copolymerization. This small imbalance can result in a small 
optical rotation of different copolymer fractions. However statistical calculations showed that this 
imbalance is negligibly small for any sufficiently long macromolecule [235] and an experimental study of 
a model R*, SO-copolymer found no optical rotation in the copolymer fractions (hydrogenated poly-
(R*,S*)-CH-CH-CHMeEt [236]).

methyl-1-pentene and elution chromatography with the same crystalline polymer. The 
separation efficiencies of both methods are not high [214, 239]. Nevertheless, these separation 
methods demonstrated the existence of stereoselective polymerization with heterogeneous 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts [214, 236-238]. The degree of stereos election was estimated from: (a) 
data on the optical rotations of different polymer fractions that were obtained by the 
separation procedures, (b) the absolute values of the optical rotation of the analogous pure 
optically active polymers [240, 241], and (c) separation efficiency. 8 The data are presented in 
Table III-26. 
A partially stereoselective polymerization process, e.g., the overlap of both 
processes in Scheme 111-70, can be described as a copolymerization of two mono-
mers, R* and S*, in equal concentration (i.e., with a value of the monomer feed ratio 
Fin Eqn. 111-46 of 1). Ifthe stereoselection process is pronounced, the polymeri-
zation product is a pure R*-homopolymer (and a pure S*-homopolymer) and if 
stereoselection does not occur the product is a copolymer with the composition 
ratio f = [(R*)/(S *)] = 1 (Eqn. III -96). The application of a general copolymeriza-
tion scheme (see, for example, Eqns. 111-46 and III-58) gives one the possibility to 
estimate the "reactivity ratio" for such copolymerization r' = kR*R*/kR*s* = ks*s*/ 
kS*R* (assuming r'r" = 1). These "reactivity ratios" are presented in Table 111-26. 
As is evident from the table the stereoselection efficiency strongly depends on 
the position of the asymmetric carbon atom with respect to the double bond of a 
monomer. The selection is high in the case of the a-position, is moderate for the 
p-position, and is virtually absent for the ,),-position. The stereo selectivity depends 
on the type of catalytic system also-see Table 111-27 [214]. 
As in the case of the stereospecific polymerization mechanism (see Section 111-3), 
two principal driving forces of the stereoselection can, in general, be envisaged: 
(i) steric interactions between asymmetric carbon atoms of the last unit of a 
growing chain and an approaching monomer molecule-a variant of the chain 
end control mechanism applied to stereoselection. 
(ii) steric interactions between a chiral catalytic center and the approaching mono-
mer molecule which leads not only to isotactic enchainment of the monomer but 
to stereoselection of one of the two enantiomeric molecules ((R*) or (S*)) as 
well [242]. 
Many efforts were made to elucidate the problem. An obvious method for 
examining the role of the last unit in a polymer chain is to study copolymerizations 
of olefins containing asymmetric carbon atoms with ethylene [243, 244]. The idea of 
such experiments is that when an ethylene molecule is positioned between the active 
center and an asymmetric monomer unit

8 Another difficulty encountered in such studies is the low solubility of the polymers. This prevents 
analysis of the fractions with the highest molecular weight and probably the highest degree of 
stereoselection.

III: Stereospecificity of Heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta Catalysts 
the penultimate unit, because of its remote position, cannot influence any stereose-
lection occurring during subsequent chain growth steps (see, for example, Table 
111-26). Should stereoselection be observed in such a case, it can be attributed to a 
catalyst-controlled process, as, for example, in Scheme 111-66. 
Experiments demonstrated [244, 245] that the insertion of ethylene molecules 
into the chains ofpoly-3, 7-dimethyl-I-octene (44% ethylene) and poly-4-methyl~ 
l-hexene (22% ethylene) obtained with the b-TiCI3-Ali-Bu3 system at 15Â°C does 
not reduce significantly the degree of stereoselection: the real separation parameters 
F for these homopolymers are 27.3-33.6% and those for the copolymers are 
23-29%. These facts allowed, the authors of Refs. [243] and [244] to exclude the 
influence of the asymmetric carbon atom of the last monomer unit in the growing 
polyolefin chain on the stereoselection process. 
The elucidation of the role of the active center chirality in the stereoselection 
process is a very complex problem. As soon as the normal stereoselection process 
described above produces equimolecular mixtures of macromolecules with pre-
ferential incorporation of R* and S* isomers it can be supposed that the catalyst 
surface contains equal amounts of active centers with opposite chirality. The 
rational approach in this case would be to suppress the reactivity of the centers of 
one particular chirality or to enhance their reactivity and to produce a stereoelective 
catalyst, i.e., a catalyst which preferentially polymerizes one half of the monomer 
molecules, R* or S*, and leaves the other half mostly unpolymerized-see Scheme 
III-71.

(111-71 ) 
Two empirical approaches to the formation of such stereoelective catalysts were studied. The 
first one is the modification of the behavior of the active centers by the addition of some 
optically active component to them (organometallic compounds, electron donors, etc.) 
[245-248]. The results of these studies were not conclusive. On one hand, when the catalytic 
system TiClc AI-tris-[(S*)-2-methylbutyl] dietherate was used, it was discovered that the 
optically active group migrated to the polymer chain end (polypropylene, polystyrene) but 
this catalyst could not resolve (R*, S*)-4-methyl-l-hexene: no optically active monomer was 
left after partial polymerization of this monomer [245]. On the other hand, the chemically 
similar catalytic system TiClc Zn-bis-[(S*)-2-methylbutyl] produces mildly stereoelective 
centers with the [(R*)/(S *)] activity ratio r' ranging from 1.69 (polymerization of 3-methyl-l-
pentene) to 1.15 (polymerization of 3, 7-dimethyl-l-octene). This results in a small optical 
enrichment (1. 7-3.2%) of the residual monomer mixture [234, 247]. In all cases studied, the 
stereoelectivity was lower than stereoselectivity (compare with Table 111-26) and the nature 
of the catalyst modification by organozinc compounds remained obscure [214]. 
The existence of stereo election became obvious when supported Ziegler-Natta 
catalysts were used for polymerization of the same monomer [249, 250]. When the 
TiCI4/MgCI2-Ali-Bu3 catalyst was used for polymerizations of 4-methyl-I-hexene 
or 3, 7-dimethyl-I-octene (racemic monomer mixtures in both cases) it exibited very 
high activity but relatively poor isospecificity: at 20Â°C the yield of the crystalline 
polymer was ca. 75% for poly-4-methyl-I-hexene and ca. 80% for poly-3, 7-

III -10: Stereoselective and Stereoelective Olefin Polymerization

dimethyl-l-octene [2S0]. Such catalysts are traditionally modified by aromatic acid 
esters to reduce the yield of the amorphous polymer (see Sections II-S-e and IV-I-b). 
It was found that when the aromatic acid ester was optically active Â« - )-menthyl 
anisate), the remaining (unpoisoned) catalytic centers became stereoelective. The 
most unambiguous results were obtained at high concentrations of the ester-see 
Table III-28. 
It is obvious from these data that the optically active ester, or the product of its 
interaction with Ali-Bu3 (see Section II-S-e) which is optically active also, forms 
isospecific polymerization centers which exhibit some degree of stereoelectivity: the 
R-type monomer is more reactive with these centers, leaving some excess of the 
unreacted S monomer. Apparently aspecific centers do not exhibit this electivity 
and the formation of the optically active amorphous material is merely the result of 
the developed optical activity of the unreacted monomer. Judging by the optical 
purity of unreacted monomers and isotactic polymers shown in Table III-28, the 
resolving power of stereoelective centers is much lower than their stereoregulative 
power, which is very high for the active centers of these supported catalysts 
(kiso/ksyndio is ca. 30-S0). The situation becomes even more complicated if the 
amount of optically active ester is decreased. In such systems, several types of 
polymerization centers coexist and they exhibit various degrees of isospecificity and 
stereoelectivity, including centers with various signs of stereoelectivity [249, 2S0]. 
The second approach to stereoelective polymerization is the copolymerization 
of two monomers containing asymmetric carbon atoms, one in the optically active 
form and the second in the form of a racemic mixture [2S1]. The idea of the 
experiment is conveyed by the following scheme:

Catalytic chiral centers of the R*-type, if they exist, will preferentially choose 
from the monomer mixture R* monomers of both types and will produce a copoly-
mer whereas the active centers ofthe S * type will choose preferentially S1 monomer 
and produce its homopolymer. If the selection activities of R* and S* centers are not 
modified by the presence of the R! units in the chain the unreacted second monomer 
will remain racemic. The decrease in consumption of the R! monomer due to the 
copolymerization effect will be negligible because both monomers used, 3-methyl-l-
pentene and 3, 7-dimethyl-l-octene, have very similar arrangements in the vicinity 
of their double bonds and will have very close '1 and '2 values-compare with 
Section I-3-b.

(i) stereoselection of this type really takes place: the copolymers (more easily 
soluble) and "homopolymers" have opposite signs of optical rotation, i.e., the 
polymerization centers of the R* type indeed prefer both comonomers with R* 
asymmetric carbon atoms. In practice this selection was not complete, of 
course. Instead of one random copolymer and one homopolymer as in Scheme 
III-72 two statistical copolymers were formed 
-(CH-rH-)n-(CH-rH-)m-(CH-\H)k-
R! 
R! 
S! 
One copolymer had a high n value, with m Â» k and the sign of its optical 
rotation corresponded to that of poly(CHz=CH-R!), and the second 
copolymer had a lower n value, with k Â» m and the sign of its optical rotation 
was opposite from that of the first copolymer. 
(ii) quite unexpectedly the unreacted monomer mixture after the copolymerization 
became optically active too: the polymerization rate of CHz=CH-R! ap-
peared to be marginally higher than that of CHz=CH -S! (ca. 0.8-1.7%). 
This stereoselection is not connected with the formation of organoaluminum 
compounds containing optically active alkyl groups [214] and can be interpre-
ted in two ways: (a) either the propagation rate constant for the mixture of 
CHz=CH-R! and CHz=CH-R! is higher than the propagation rate 
constant for CHz=CH -S! due to some combination of steric factors, or (b) 
the presence of the optically active monomer CHz=CH-R! activates more 
R*-type centers than S*-type centers, i.e., a real stereoelective process takes 
place. The small optical rotation of the monomer residue can be reconciled 
equally well with both these possibilities. 
A very important contribution to the area of stereoselective polymerization of 
olefins with optically active carbon atoms in their alkyl groups was made when 13C_ 
NMR spectra of various polymers of 3-methyl-l-pentene were analyzed. These 
polymers were obtained with the 13C-Iabeled catalyst <>-TiCI3-AI(13CH3h-
Zne 3CH3)z,9 as well as from the racemic 13C-Iabeled monomer (R*)(S*)-I- 13C-
3-methyl-l-pentene with the application of the unlabeled catalyst [252]. Judging by 
the X-ray data, all polymer products exhibited very high crystallinity indicating a 
very high degree of isotacticity for these polymers. Comparison of the spectra of 
these polymers gives one the possibility to examine the problem of stereoselectivity 
in all its complexity, and, in particular, to make a distinction between stereoselectiv-
ity in the beginning of the polymerization reaction (in its initiation step) and in the 
course of regular propagation steps. Consider, for example, the following sequence 
of chemical steps including the propagation step, the chain transfer step with the 
participation of ZnMez, and the subsequent hydrolysis of the Zn-polymer bond by 
water: 
9 ZnMe2 was used as a component of the system in order to reduce the molecular weight of the polymers 
and to increase the concentration of their end-groups, which yield the most important information about 
the structure of the polymers.

The following simplified steric scheme (Scheme 1II-74) of these reactions can be 
examined for the polymerization of racemic 13C-Iabeled 3-methyl-I-pentene 
(13CH2=CH-C4 H 9) on two types of polymerization centers (D-type and L-type, 
as in the previous discussion) provided that the centers exhibit perfect stereospeci-
ficity, i.e., produce isotactic polymer chains only: the D(L) centers produce chains 
consisting of D(L) monomer units (see Se-ction III-4). 
In this scheme we are concerned with the structure of the last monomer units 
(bearing labeled 13CH3 groups) only. These groups are easily distinguishable in 
13C-NMR spectra from other monomer units in the polymers which have labeled

CH2 groups. Because the reaction of chain termination with ZnMe2 is a completely 
random process one can be assured that the steric structure of these last units 
accurately represents the steric structure of all other monomer units in the polymer. 
The definition of stereoselection exerted by polymerization centers rather than 
by the last units in growing chains assumes that, whereas both D- and L-
polymerization centers can in principle polymerize both S*- and R*-optical iso-
mers, they preferentially choose one of them. In kinetic terms this means that in the 
Reaction Scheme III-74 kl =F k2 and k3 =F k 4 . 
Careful assignment of all peaks in the 13C_ NMR spectra of these polymers [252] 
and analysis of peak intensities resulted in three important findings: 
(i) The stereo selectivity indeed exists. The value of r' = ks*s*/ks*R* defined earlier 
in this section for polymerization of racemic 3-methyl-I-pentene with the J-
TiCI 3-AIMe3-ZnMe2 system at 50Â°C is close to 2.5. This is much less than the 
corresponding value for 3,7-dimetyl-I-octene but higher than that for 4-
methyl-I-hexene-see Table 1II-26 (it should be remembered that both these 
values in Table III-26 were determined by a much less precise indirect method). 
(ii) The stereo selectivity does not depend much on the length of the polymer chain 
attached to the active centers in Scheme III -74. Even in the initiation step, when 
the chain is merely a methyl group, the r' value is close to 2. 
(iii) The 13C-NMR data allowed a precise steric determination of which side of the 
double bond of an optically active olefin molecule is preferentially attacked by 
a polymerization center. This is shown in Fig. III-18 for (R*)-3-methyl-l-
pentene.

Summing up the data for the polymerization of olefins containing asymmetric 
carbon atoms in their alkyl groups, it can be said that they strongly support the 
concept of enantiomorphous catalysis (the existence of two types of active centers 
with opposite chirality) and additionally reveal some kind of interaction between 
the active centers and the alkyl groups of the approaching monomer molecules. This 
interaction is the origin of the stereoselection phenomena. Most probably it has a 
purely steric origin and results in a small (ca. 0.4 kcal/mol) difference in the 
activation energies for the interaction between the polymerization centers and two 
"faces" of the double bond in asymmetric olefin molecules. 
111-11. Stereoregularity of Monomer Sequences in Olefin Copolymers 
The study of olefin copolymer structure is a powerful method of elucidating 
the mechanism of stereoregulation by the active centers of heterogeneous 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts. General considerations reveal three principal possible 
sources of stereoregulation [54, 168]: 
Chain end control. This classic explanation of the stereospecificity-in the course 
of vinyl monomer polymerization by free ionic and free radical species can 
be, in principle, applied to olefin polymerization with heterogeneous 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts also (see also Section III-3). In the anionic-type 
polymerization scheme, the last unit of a chain already possesses an

This asymmetric center by itself can, in theory, be a reason for the stereo-
specific addition of the next monomer unit [253]. 
Helix control mechanism. The most favored conformation of all isotactic 
polyolefins is a helix (of the type 31,72 , or 41) which most probably develops 
simultaneously with the growth of the polymer chain-see Fig. 111-2. The 
existence of a helix segment close to an active center can favor the continu-
ation of the helix formation which, in effect, meanS the continuation of the 
isotactic monomer addition of monomer units to the growing chain. The 
importance of this effect was proposed, for example, in the study of the 
polymerization of N-carboxylic acid anhydrides [168]. 
Active center control mechanism. It is widely recognized that active centers on the 
surface of heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts are chiral (see Chapter V). 
The particular sources of this chirality are discussed in Chapter V. It is 
sufficient to say here that this asymmetry by itself can be responsible for 
isotactic chain formation. 
A priori it is quite possible that all these mechanisms contribute to the formation of 
isotactic polyolefin chains, but their relative significances in the process of chain 
growth are difficult to determine if only homopolymer stereoregularity is studied. 
The study of copolymer chain structure is a convenient method allowing the 
influence of one of the active center characteristics On stereospecificity to be 
evaluated while keeping other properties unchanged. The co-participation of two or 
more monomers in a polymerization process gives one the possibility to modify 
significantly the asymmetric properties of the last unit in the growing chain as well 
as to change the character of a polymer helix in the vicinity of an active center while 
retaining the asymmetry of the center. For example, the elegant studies of the 
structure of ethylene-propylene copolymers obtained with isospecific catalysts 
clearly demonstrated that the chain end control mechanism plays virtually no role in 
the stereochemical process of polyo1efin chain formation. The idea of the experi-
ment was to study the stereochemistry of propylene addition to the growing chain 
just after the moment when the isotactic polypropylene chain growth was inter-
rupted by the addition of a single ethylene unit [254-256]. Two alternative events 
have to be considered in this case:

Prior to this reaction the growing polymer chain had no asymmetric carbon atom 
in the vicinity of the active center. If the isotactic character of propylene addition to 
an isotactic polymer chain is governed by the interaction between the approaching 
monomer molecule and the asymmetric last unit of the growing chain (chain end 
control mechanism) the two stereochemical reactions in Scheme 111-75 (reactions I 
and 2) will have the same probability because no stereochemical control is exercised 
at this stage. On the other hand, if the isotactic character of the monomer addition 
to the chain is governed by the active center asymmetry, reaction route 2 character-
istic for a given center will prevail irrespective of the interruption of the isotactic 
chain by a single ethylene unit. The possibility of examining the role of helix control 
by this method is dubious because the single ethylene unit can easily incorporate 
into the isotactic chain adopting the TG conformation instead of the usual TT 
conformation 11 [257]. 
The 13C-NMR spectra of ethylene-propylene copolymers obtained with iso-
specific catalysts show [254-256], in addition to the polypropylene resonances 
described in Section III-2-a, two additional peaks that may be assigned to two 
carbon atoms ofa single ethylene unit-see Fig. 11I-19(A). The peak assignments 
are as follows [255, 256]: 
The equal intensity of the two peaks in Fig. III -19(A) belonging to the ethylene 
unit is explained by the fact that 13C-enriched ethylene was used for the copoly-
merization reaction in Refs. [254] and [256]. It can be seen from Fig. 11I-19(A) that 
only one narrow resonance appears in the spectrum for every carbon atom of the 
ethylene unit. No broadening of either of these peaks was observed, even at very 
high resolution (67.9 MHz [255]). This rules out the possibility of the coexistence of 
two stereochemical sequences, (1) and (2) in Scheme 111-75, and suggests that all 
these ethylene units are in the same stereochemical configuration, presumably 
stereo sequence (2) in Scheme 111-75, taking into account the isospecific character of 
the catalytic system used. 
11 TG conformations are quite usual for linear hydrocarbons in the amorphous state. In the case under 
examination this TG conformation can be stabilized by the possibility for the defected chain with the 
single ethylene unit to incorporate the polypropylene crystaL

On the other hand, the spectrum of a similar ethylene-propylene copolymer obtained with 
a syndiospecific catalytic system (Fig. 1II-19(B)) is much more complex. The principal dif-
ferences between the spectra of Fig. III-19(A) and III-19(B) with regard to the resonances 
of the single ethylene unit are the following additional features in Fig. III-19(B): 
(i) the resonance at 38.0 ppm is split into two signals with ~'t = 0.8 ppm. This is most 
probably due to the formation of two different sequences [256, 258]

(ii) each of these two signals is split also (see Fig. III-19(B)) and the resonance at 24.6 ppm is 
broadened [256] due to the overlap of the peaks of two stereo sequences corresponding to

reaction routes (I) and (2) in Scheme III-75. This indicates the absence of the active 
center control mechanism in syndiospecific propylene polymerization [254-256]. 
(iii) two additional broad resonances appear at 34.9 and 35.7 ppm. These are assigned to the 
ethylene unit surrounded by two propylene units in a "head-to-head" arrangement [254,

These data demonstrate that the chain end control mechanism can be excluded as 
the principal source of stereoregulation in the case of heterogeneous isospecific 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts, whereas in the case of syndiospecific propylene polymeri-
zation both stereospecificity and regiospecificity (secondary or primary addition 
of monomer molecules to a growing chain) are controlled by the last unit of the 
growing chain [254, 256]. However, additional experiments are necessary to dis-
criminate more clearly between the roles of the asymmetric active center and the 
polymer helix in the formation of isotactic polyolefins. 
Additional important information on the stereo regulation processes in the 
course of olefin copolymerization was obtained in studies of the structure of 
different olefin copolymers in a wide composition range. Figures III-20 and III-21 
contain data on the propylene unit distribution in two propylene copolymers, 
C3H6-C3D6 (catalytic system b-TiCI3-AlEt2 Cl [125]) and C3H6-C2H4 (catalytic 
sustem a-TiCI3-AlEt3) [59, 120, 124]. The C3H6-C3D6 copolymers can be named 
"copolymers" only conditionally. These products remain highly crystalline for all 
compositions and exhibit the same helix conformation independently of the deuter-
ated propylene content. The only characteristics which reveal their "copolymer" 
nature are their vibrational and NMR spectra. On the other hand, ethylene-
propylene copolymers are true copolymers: when the ethylene content of these 
products increases their conformation becomes irregular and their crystallinity 
decreases gradually [120]. Experimental points in Figs. III-20 and III-21 represent 
normalized relative intensities of the 998 and 973 cm -1 bands in the IR spectra of 
these copolymers [59, 120, 124, 125]. These bands characterize isotactic propylene 
sequences in the copolymers. It can be seen from the figures that the amount of 
propylene units in these sequences sharply decreases when the amount of a second 
comonomer in the copolymers increases. The curves in Figs. III-20 and III-21 were 
calculated with the application of statistical dependencies for copolymers described 
in Section III-4-b. They represent the fractions of propylene units in the isotactic 
sequences containing at least n + 1 units (Eqn. III-52). n being 4 for the 973 cm-1 
band and 9-10 for the 998 cm-1 band (see Table III-3). 
One important feature of these propylene copolymers emerges when their IR 
distributional characteristics are compared with statistical calculations (Figs. III-20 
and III-24). In both cases, experimental data coincide well with calculations which 
12 Copolymerization of ethylene and propylene with soluble syndiospecific catalytic systems can be 
regarded as terpolymerization of ethylene and two pseudo-monomers, propylene molecules with two 
orientations with respect to an active center, CH 2=CHCH 3 and CH3CH=CH 2 [256].

take into account only the sequence distribution characteristics of the copolymers 
(represented by the '1'2 product-see Section III-4-b) and the catalyst stereospeci-
ficity (represented by the R = kiso/ksyndiO values) and do not take into account 
conformational characteristics of these copolymers, which are assumed equally 
perfect in the statistical calculations. This coincidence shows that propylene unit 
distribution in sufficiently long isotactic sequences in these copolymers is not 
influenced by the chemical structure, conformation, and crystallinity of the polymer 
products, i.e., the probability ofthe formation oflong isotactic propylene sequences 
does not depend on their neighbors, whether they are situated in perfect helix 
molecules (in C3H6-C3D6 copolymers) or in molecules of varied chemical com-
position and reduced regularity (in C2HCC3H6 copolymers). This means that the 
steric structure of these blocks, and hence the stereoregulative power of the 
polymerization centers, is not affected by the chemical and spatial structure of the 
polymer chains, i.e., it is mainly determined by the structure of the active center 
rather than by the chemical structure of the last unit in the growing chain or the 
shape of the chain in the vicinity of the active center.

13C-NMR data for ethylene-propylene copolymers obtained with the TiCI3-
based catalytic system confirm this conclusion [259]. A careful comparison of the 
NMR spectra of the copolymers with different compositions allowed the assign-
ment of the resonances of many chemical sequences in the spectra. High isospecifi-
city of the catalyst used (see Section 111-6) enables one to suppose in a sufficiently 
good approximation that practically all long sequences of propylene units have 
perfectly isotactic structure. The data on propylene and ethylene unit distribution 
in these copolymers tabulated in Ref. [259] are presented in Fig. 111-22 as functions 
of the copolymer composition. Theoretical curves in these plots were calculated 
with Eqns. 111-54-111-57 for the '1'2 product equal to 1.9 (found by trial and 
error)13 and for R = kiso/ksyndio -+ 00.14 It can be seen from Fig. 111-22 that the 
experimental data for both ethylene and propylene unit distribution agree well with 
the statistical calculations, i.e., the content of propylene units in long isotactic 
sequences (iso-PPPP and iso-PPPPP, i.e., tetrad mmm and pentad mmmm) can be 
described quantitatively by the same R value independently of the copolymer 
composition. This means that the ability of the catalytic centers to produce long 
meso-sequences of propylene units is not altered by the presence of ethylene se-
quences of any length in the copolymer chains. 
Two other examples of monomer unit distribution in olefin copolymers are 
presented in Fig. 111-23 where IR data are compared for two types of copolymers 
containing 4-methyl-l-pentene units: those of 4-methyl-l-pentene with I-hexene 
[120,261] and of 4-methyl-l-pentene with ethylene [120]. Both these copolymers 
were obtained with the same catalytic system, fJ-Ti Cl3 - AlEt2 Cl, under very similar 
conditions. The value of the, 1'2 product for the first comonomer system is ca. 3 
and for the second comonomer pair, ca. 5. Both 4-methyl-l-pentene and I-hexene 
13This estimated value is in excellent agreement with the value of the '1'2 product for the 
c>-TiCI3-AlEt2Cl system (1.9) [260]. 
14 All measurements of propylene unit distribution in Ref. [259] were made using resonances of CH, 
CH2 , and CH3 groups in meso-sequences-see Figs. 111-6 and 111-18.

produce homopolymers with the same chain conformation (helix 72) and these 
monomer units are perfectly isomorphous in their copolymers [262, 263], i.e., from 
the stereochemical point of view, l-hexene units in the copolymer chains can be 
regarded as "disguised" 4-methyl-l-pentene units. These copolymers retain high 
(40-70%) crystallinity in a wide range of compositions [120]. On the other hand, 
homopolymers of ethylene and 4-methyl-l-pentene are incompatible and, when 
these monomers copolymerize, they are not isomorphous. Nevertheless, experi-
mental points characterizing the distribution of 4-methyl-l-pentene units in isotac-
tic blocks in these copolymers (estimated from the relative intensity of the 996 cm-1 
band in the IR spectra-see Section III-2-b) coincide sufficiently well for these two 
types of copolymers, indicating a virtual lack of influence of the structure of the 
last unit on the isospecificity of active centers, as well as the relative insignificance 
of the helix effect compared with the matrix effect of the active centers.

The data presented in this section as well as some related data [120] demonstrate 
that the steric purity of monomer sequences in olefin copolymers is approximately 
the same as that for olefin homopolymers obtained with the same heterogeneous 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts. This means that the active centers of these catalysts form 
isotactic blocks in copolymers in virtually the same manner as they do in a homo-
polymerization process and that the insertion of "foreign" units in polyolefin chains 
practically does not alter the stereo regulative power of the active centers.

Chapter IV 
Inhomogeneity of Active Centers of 
Heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta Catalysts 
Introduction 
Active center inhomogeneity with respect to kinetic characteristics is a well-known 
attribute of any heterogeneous catalyst. In the case of usual catalytic processes, 
where both reagents and products are low molecular compounds, the inhomogene-
ity of the centers is frequently masked by overlapping adsorption and desorption 
phenomena: under a given set of conditions, the most active centers are blocked by 
adsorbed products, the least active centers weakly adsorb reagents, and only the 
centers of medium activity "function." In the case of heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta 
catalysts these masking phenomena have no great significance. The mean olefin 
adsorption capacity of their active centers is low (see Section 11-8) and the reaction 
products, polyolefin molecules, are not adsorbed on the active centers at all. For this 
reason, these catalysts can be regarded as good subjects for the study of active center 
inhomogeneity. 
Experiments with partial catalyst poisoning (see Section 11-5-h) demonstrated 
that such inhomogeneity does exist. The data presented in this chapter deal with 
different aspects of active center inhomogeneity which manifest themselves primar-
ily in the properties of the reaction products, homopolymers and copolymers. 
IV-t. 
Distribution of Active Centers with Different 
Stereospecificity 
IV -I-a. 
Existence and Models of Continuous Distribution 
The very first experiments on polyolefin synthesis with heterogeneous Ziegler-
Natta catalysts revealed that the polymer products are mixtures of macromolecules

which differ not only in molecular weight but also in stereo regularity [1]. Most of 
the papers describing the synthesis of stereoregular polyolefins contain data on 
polymer fractionation by solvent extraction. As was discussed previously (Section 
III-5), n-heptane was chosen as a fractionation agent for isotactic polypropylene 
[1,2]. Despite the fact that this choice was arbitrary, this method for the estimation 
of stereoregularity received general acceptance. It became customary to regard every 
polyolefin (and polypropylene first of all) as a mixture of macromolecules consist-
ing of three fractions which differ in their stereoregularity: 
(i) the fraction insoluble in boiling n-heptane-the highly isotactic polymer (its 
characteristics are described in Chapter III). 
(ii) the fraction soluble in boiling n-heptane and insoluble in cold n-heptane 
(20Â° C)-the so-called "stereoblock" polymer containing relatively short iso-
tactic blocks separated by atactic or syndiotactic sequences. 
(iii) the fraction soluble in cold n-heptane-amorphous atactic polymer. 
When this structural inhomogeneity of poly ole fins is examined, the first question 
which arises is: are these three types of polymers produced on chemically similar 
catalytic centers or are the irregular fractions produced on some chemically differ-
ent centers, e.g., on centers of radical or cationic type? The body of data on the 
chemical structure of polyolefin fractions favors the first assumption: 
(i) atactic polypropylene has a relatively regular "head-to-tail" structure but it is 
apparently less regular than the isotactic fractions (see Table III-I) whereas 
cationic polypropylene is characterized by strong chemical irregularity [3-5]. 
(ii) unsaturated end-groups of atactic polyolefins have predominantly vinylidenic 
structure CH 2=C'::: (see Section III-I-a) whereas cationic polypropylene has 
no double bonds of the vinyl, vinylidene, or vinylene type and radical polypro-
pylene 1 has mainly vinyl double bonds CH2=CH- due to the recombination 
reaction between growing chains and the allyl radical CH2=CH-CH2". 
Thus the existence of macromolecules with different stereoregularity in the 
polyolefin products obtained with heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts in most 
cases can be explained by the presence of catalytic centers of similar nature but 
exhibiting different stereoregulative power. The only apparent exception is the 
atactic polystyrene obtained in the same runs as the isotactic polymer. 
Ethylene-styrene copolymers obtained with the heterogeneous Ti-based catalysts 
in all cases can be separated into two parts, atactic polystyrene (soluble in ketones) 
and true copolymers. This shows that the atactic polystyrene is formed by a different 
mechanism (most probably cationic) [7]. An additional proof of the presence of 
atactic cationic polystyrene can be found in the IR spectra of styrene-propylene 
copolymers [8]. 
Two alternative models can be proposed to explain the formation of polyolefin 
1 Radical polymerization of propylene can be carried out at very high pressure (5000-7000 atm) and 
results in the formation of a low molecular weight polymer [6].

(i) Only two types of catalytic centers exist, one producing highly isotactic polymer 
and the second one producing purely atactic material, other fractions of inter-
mediate stereoregularity being accidental mixtures of these polymers due to 
inefficient fractionation with respect to both molecular weight and 
stereoregularity. 
(ii) There exists a continuous (or quasi-continuous) distribution of active centers 
with respect to their stereospecificity resulting in the formation of macro-
molecules with various degrees of stereoregularity. 
There are three kinds of experimental data which indicate that the second model 
is correct. The first proof of the continuous distribution model is related to the study 
of the melting points of polymer fractions. Table IV -1 contains the melting points of 
polypropylene fractions obtained by a complex multi-solvent fractionation proce-
dure [2]. 
Similar data on the polypropylene fraction melting points are presented in Ref. [9] 
(see Table IV-2) [10-12]. 
The melting point dependence on polymer stereoregularity was discussed in 
Section 11I-2-c. The Flory equation (Eqn. 111-8) predicts a significant melting point 
depression with stereoregularity decrease. On the other hand, the melting points of 
mixtures of isotactic and atactic polypropylene are virtually independent of the 
composition of the mixture and remain close to that of isotactic polypropylene [2]. 
The dependence of the melting points of polypropylene fractions on the IR stereore-
gularity parameter (macrotacticity M; see Table 111-3) is presented in Fig. IV-I. The 
experimental points in this figure are taken from Refs. [2], [10], and [11] and from 
Table IV-4, and the theoretical curves are calculated using Eqns. 111-8, 111-24, and 
III-27 for different kinetic stereoregularity parameters R (see Eqn. 111-17), will T:!, 
= 176Â°C [2,11,13], AHuin Eqn. 111-8 in the 1600-2600 cal/mol range, andjeff values 
for the 998 cm- 1 band equal to 11 and 13 (see Table 111-3). 
Significant scatter of the experimental data is apparent and is probably related to

differences in the procedures used for the melting point measurements as well as to 
the influence of the polymer molecular weight and crystallization methods on the 
melting points [13]. Nevertheless, it is evident that the experimental data can be 
satisfactorily described by the Flory equation, which means that polypropylene 
fractions of intermediate stereoregularity are not mixtures of highly isotactic and 
atactic polymers but are individual products. 
The study of high-resolution 13C-NMR spectra of polypropylene fractions 
confirms this conclusion. Representative data for the polypropylene fractions of the 
polymer obtained with the ()-TiCl3-AlEt2 CI system at 74Â°C [9] are presented in 
Table IV-2 and those for the polypropylene fractions obtained with the p-
TiCI3-AlEt2CI and VCI3-AlEt2CI systems at 15Â°C [14] are shown in Table IV-3. 
This table also contains data for polypropylene obtained with the supported 
TiCI4 /MgCI2-AlEt3/ester catalyst [15]. 
It can be seen that every polymer fraction has an individual combination of 
pentad values which usually cannot be presented as a weighted sum of these values

for the isotactic and the atactic fractions. Note, for example, the relatively high level 
of rmmr pentads and the low level of rrrr pentads in the fractions of intermediate 
isotacticity. 
Infrared data also can be used to demonstrate the continuous distribution of 
polypropylene stereoregularity. Table IV-4 contains some characteristics of poly-
propylene fractions (polymerization with the b-TiCI3-AlEt2 CI system at 70Â°C in 
propane-propylene mixtures). 
The principle of the proof is that the statistical correlations between different IR 
stereoregularity parameters for the fractions of intermediate regularity would be 
different depending on their constitution, i.e., whether they are mixtures of isotactic 
and atactic polymers or individual products. The experimental data of Table IV-4 
are presented in Fig. IV-2 (M plotted against ct) together with some other experi-
mental data for the fractions of polypropylene samples obtained with the b-
TiCI3-AlEt3 , ct-TiCl3-Ali-Bu3 , and ct-TiCI3-pyridine-AlEt3 catalytic systems. 
Curves 1 and 2 in this figure correspond to the statistical dependencies for the 

330 
IV: Inhomogeneity of Active Centers 
enantiomorphous center model (see Eqn. 1II-24): xn+dxs versus Xs for n = 10 
(curve 1) and n = 12 (curve 2). Curves 3 and 4 were calculated with the assumption 
that the fractions of intermediate regularity are mixtures of perfectly isotactic 
polymer and the atactic material characterized by a = 30% (close to statistically 
atactic polymer, curve 3) and by a = 45%. Experimental data coincide well with 
the calculated curves for the case when the fractions of intermediate regularity are 
regarded as individual polymers with some particular R values (see Table IV-4). 
The downward deviations from the correlation for polymer fractions of low 
regularity (a'" 60-70%) are due to the conformational disorder of these polymers 
at room temperature. Sample cooling results in an M value increase (see arrow in 
Fig. IV-2). 
Thus, three independent sources of experimental data (melting points, NMR 
data, and IR data) suggest that the fractions of polypropylene samples obtained 
with different heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts are individual (in a structural 
sense) products formed at particular centers on the catalyst surface. The statistical 
structure of the less regular fractions is more complicated than the structure of the 
fractions with the highest regularity (discussed in Section 1II-3). 13C-NMR data 
show (see Tables IV-2 and IV-3) that these fractions have all possible stereose-
quences in their chains. However, the distribution of different pentads in these 
fractions, including the least isotactic of them, differs substantially from that for the 
ultimate "atactic" polypropylene-the polymer sample epimerized to equilibrium

The lack of randomness (low [mmrm + rrmr], [mrmr], and [mrrr] pentad content) 
and the increased content of isotactic sequences in the first sample is apparent from 
the comparison. 
The most puzzling feature revealed by IH-NMR and 13C-NMR methods is the 
presence in some polypropylene fractions of relatively long syndiotactic sequences 
[9, 14, 17-20]-rrrr pentads. This effect is especially pronounced in the case of 
polypropylene samples obtained with the TiCI3-GaEt3 catalytic system [21]. The 
fractions of this polymer that are insoluble in boiling n-heptane exhibit crystallinity 
of both isotactic and syndiotactic type (examination by the X-ray method). It can be 
easily seen from statistics (see Eqns. 1II-28-1II-31) that this high content of long 
syndiotactic sequences cannot be explained by a simple enantiomorphous center 
model. 
One evident reason for this effect is the presence of syndiotactic polypropylene in 

IV-I: Distribution of Active Centers with Different Stereospecificity 
331 
the "crude" isotactic product obtained with some heterogeneous catalysts. This 
phenomenon was first reported in Ref. [22]. Apparently some heterogeneous 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts contain not only isospecific polymerization centers alone 
but a number of syndiospecific centers as well. These centers are relatively stable at 
high temperatures2 (up to 70Â°C) and produce predominantly syndiotactic polymer. 
The syndiotactic fraction can be removed from the total polymer mixture by 
chromatography using highly isotactic polypropylene as a sorbent [22], by a careful 
multi-solvent fractionation process [22, 23], or by a specific extraction procedure 
(for example, with boiling xylene [19]), and sometimes this fraction disappears 
during the course of chemical treatment of polypropylene with subsequent recrys-
tallization [17]. The solubility of syndiotactic polypropylene in hydrocarbon sol-
vents is usually higher than that of the isotactic polymer, which explains the relative 
abundance of this component in fractions of intermediate regularity [22]. 
The syndiospecific active centers are present in a few heterogeneous catalytic 
systems only. They are relatively abundant in such systems as TiCI3-GaEt3 and 
TiClrLii-Bu (5-10% of syndiotactic polymer in a total product), scanty in (j-
TiCI3-AlEt2CI and a-TiCI3-AlEt2F systems ('" 1 %), and virtually absent in the 
majority of a-TiCI3- and VCl3-based systems [21]. 
Another specific feature of polypropylene fractions with reduced stereoregular-
ity is the increased amount of "head-to-head" unit addition-see Table III-I. For 
example, the inverted unit content in polypropylene fractions varies for polymers 
prepared with different catalysts: 
for VCI3-AlEt3 , 60Â°C: from 0.11 % for the fraction insoluble in boiling heptane 
to 1.2-1.4% for the fraction soluble in boiling ether; 
for a-TiCI3-AlEt2Cl, 74Â°C [9]: correspondingly from 0 to 1 %; 
for VCI4-AlEt3 , 40Â°C [24]: from 1.7 to 6%; 
for TiCI4-AlEt3 , 41Â°C [25]: from 0 to 4%. 
As was briefly discussed in Section 111-5, a convenient method of representing 
poly olefin stereo regularity distribution is by plotting cumulative fraction weight 
versus I/R = ksyndio/kiSO- Four such distribution curves are presented in Figs. IV-3 
and IV-4 for polypropylene obtained with heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts 
(based on NMR and IR estimations of polypropylene stereoregularity). All these 
curves have similar features: a significant amount of polymer with the highest 
isotacticity (lowest I/R values) attainable for a particular catalytic system and a 
more or less pronounced "tail" offractions with decreased regularity. The correla-
tions between the limiting isospecificity of a catalytic system (the lowest I/R value) 
and polymerization conditions are discussed in Chapter III. It is evident from Figs. 
IV-3 and IV-4 that the "isotactic index" of polypropylene (II, the fraction of 
polymer insoluble in boiling n-heptane) is in effect not a measure of catalytic center 
stereospecificity but rather one of the possible quantitative characteristics of the 
2Standard syndiospecific catalytic systems (like VCI4-AlEt2Cl) are unstable at temperatures higher 
than -30 to -40Â°C.

distribution of centers of different stereospecificity. For example, as can be seen 
from Fig. IV -4, "isotactic" fractions of polypropylene obtained at 15Â°C with the f3-
TiCI3-AlEt2 CI and VCI3-AlEt2Cl, catalytic systems are equal in a first approxi-
mation but the limiting stereoregulative power of the f3-TiCI3-AlEt2CI system is 
substantially higher than that of the VCI3-AlEt2CI system. On the other hand, 
fraction distributions of two polypropylene samples obtained with TiCl3-based 
systems (f3-TiCI3-AlEt2Cl, 15Â°C, Fig. IV-4, and <5-TiCI3-AlEt2CI, 70Â°C, Fig. IV-3) 
are different whereas their limiting stereoregulative abilities are similar. The same is 
true for polypropylene obtained with the TiCI4 /MgCI2-AlEt3 systems with and 
without modification with esters [26]. 
Figure IV-5 demonstrates six modified distribution curves for polypropylene 
obtained with three catalytic systems, a;-TiCI3-AlEt3 , a;-TiCI3-AlEt2Cl, and a;-
TiCI3-AlEtCI2-hexamethylphosphoric triamide [12]. The abscissas on both plots 
of this figure give the stereoregularity parameter p measured by the melting point 
depression method (see Section III-2-c). The statistical meaning of this parameter 
and its correlation with the R value are presented in Eqn. III-27. Whereas the 
estimation of the limit p value for most isotactic fractions by the melt depression 
method is not very precise (mainly due to the problem of the estimation of small 
melting point depressions) the general character of these distribution curves is 
similar to those obtained by spectroscopic methods. 
Fig. IV-5(B) demonstrates the effect of temperature on polypropylene stereore-
gularity in the case of the a;-TiCI3-AlEtCI2-hexamethylphosphoric triamide sys-
tem. These data have to be compared with similar data presented in Section III-8. 
It is evident from Fig. IV-5 that a temperature increase does not result in a decrease

of the limiting stereoregulative power of this catalytic system (it remains approxi-
mately constant) but it widens substantially the distribution of catalytic center 
stereospecificities. This accounts for the apparent decrease of isotactic index II. 
The shape of the low regularity "tail" in the distribution curves depends strongly 
on the type of catalytic system. Commercial catalytic systems 15-TiC13-AlEt2 CI and 
TiCI4 /MgCl2-AlEt3/ester are characterized by narrow, widely distributed irregular 
fractions. Catalytic systems generally acknowledged as "poor" from the point of 
view of fractionation usually produce polymers with strongly developed irregular 
"tails"-see Figs. IV-3-IV-S. 
Very instructive distribution curves can be obtained if one uses the crystallinity 
value as the fraction stereoregularity parameter. Some examples of such curves are 
presented in Fig. IV-6. They are based on the experimental data taken from Ref. 
[27]. It is evident that the three catalytic systems 0(-TiCI3-AlEt3, 0(-TiC13-AlEt2 CI, 
and TiCIcAlEt3 (in effect {3-TiCI3-AlEt3)' are characterized by a very close limiting 
stereoregulative ability (crystallinity 64-67%) but differ widely in stereospecificity 
distribution. 
When fractionation is carried out by the standard method (with cold and boiling 
n-heptane) the positions of the division lines on the distribution curves depend on 
the interplay of two polymer characteristics, stereoregularity and molecular weight.

As a result, the stereo regularity parameters of "stereoblock" fractions (soluble in 
boiling and insoluble in cold n-heptane) and "atactic" fractions (soluble in cold n-
heptane or boiling ether) can vary over a wide range. Some examples of such 
fractionation are presented in Table IV-5. It can be seen from this table that IR 
stereo regularity characteristics of "stereo block" fractions strongly depend on the 
catalyst properties. In some cases these fractions have high isotacticity, close to that 
of the "isotactic" fractions, and their high solubility in boiling n-heptane is due 
primarily to their low molecular weight. This is especially characteristic of polypro-
pylene obtained with highly stereospecific catalysts in the presence of high hydrogen 
concentrations (used to control the molecular weight). NMR data show that in 
some cases these fractions also contain appreciable amounts of syndiotactic se-
quences [18, 21]. 
The structure of "atactic" fractions (see Tables IV-I-IV-5) also depends on the 
catalytic system. Some of these "atactic" products possess a significant degree of

isotacticity and are partially crystalline. This becomes especially evident when 
properties of these fractions are studied at low temperatures [28-30]-see, for 
example, Fig. IV-7. On the other hand, "atactic" polypropylene obtained with the 
VClcAlEt3-ZnEtz catalyst at - 78Â°C is in effect a mixture of isotactic and 
syndiotactic polymers [31]. 
The distribution of polymerization centers in supported TiCI4 /MgClz-based 
catalysts depends on the amount of modifier (usually organic acid ester) added to 
the co-catalyst AlR3. As follows from 13C_ NMR spectra of polypropylene ether-
soluble fractions published in Ref. [32], "atactic" polypropylene obtained with the 
unmodified TiCI4 /MgClz-Ali-Bu3 system resembles the same polymer obtained 
with the b-TiCI3-AlRzCl system: the distribution of monomer units in its chains is 
characterized by a slight prevalence of isotactic addition. Addition of ethyl anisate 
to this system brings about the expected result (see Sections II-5-e and IV-I-b): it 
sharply reduces the volume of the amorphous polymer from 36 to ca. 3%. In 
addition, this modification changes the structure of the amorphous fraction. It 
becomes more syndiotactic: the [mmmm]: [rrrr] ratio decreases from 2.1 to 0.7. 
Apparently a modifying agent in the system (either the ester itself or the products of 
its interaction with AlR3, see Section II-5-e) poisons various aspecific centers to a 
different degree. 
Fractionation of other polyolefins obtained with heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta 
catalysts gives similar results: fractions soluble in different solvents have decreased 
isotacticity compared with the corresponding insoluble fractions but remain par-

contains some fractions with irregular structure. As was discussed before, these 
fractions are indistinguishable from standard "atactic" polystyrene and are prob-
ably formed by cationic polymerization. 
All the data presented above characterize macromolecular distributions on the 
basis oftheir stereoregularity. To obtain active center distributions with respect to 
stereospecificity from these data one needs information about the mean propa-
gation rate constants for the active centers of different stereospecificity. Some

experimental data show that the propagation constants for centers of different 
stereospecificity are approximately equal [33].3 If this is true, the distribution curves 
presented in Figs. IV-3 and IV-4 are, in effect, curves characterizing active center 
distributions of heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts with respect to their 
stereospecificity. 
In some simple cases, such as those shown in Figs. IV-3 and IV-4, these curves can be 
quantitatively represented by the model distribution function <p(I/R) which includes a 
portion (Nt) of monodispersed, highly stereospecific centers with R = Rmax (shown by the 
dotted line in Fig. IV-8) and another portion (1 - Nt) of centers with a continuous distri-
bution of I/R values, <p(1/R), so that 
L<P(I/R) = Nt + (1 - Nt) fiRm;. <p(I/R)d(I/R) = 1 
I/Rmu 
(IV-I) 
A simple and adequate approach to the description of the <p function is to apply the 
exponential expression (in a normalized form) assuming Rmin = 1: 
3 Recent data [26] indicate that for propylene polymerization with the TiCI4 /MgCI2-AlEt3 system at 
60Â°C kp for isospecific centers is ca. two times higher than kp for aspecific centers.

expression for the cumulative weight of the fractions with R values from Rl to 1. Approxi-
mate estimates for values of Rmax, Nl , and a from the experimental curves can be easily 
performed by a manual or computer curve-adjusting method with the application of Eqns. 
IV-3 and IV-4 by using Eqns. IV-2 and IV-5 for cp(ljR) and Rp. For example, for the b-
TiCI3-AlEt2Cl catalytic system (Fig. IV-3)

Nl = 0.8, 
a = 3-4, 
and for the VCI 3-AlEt3 catalytic system (Fig. IV-4):

stereospecificities-the effect of various poisons and modifiers on the distributions. 
The most important solid component of the supported catalysts is TiCl4 deposited 
on the surface of finely ground MgCI2 . This solid, when used in combination with 
organoaluminum compounds (AlEt3' Ali-Bu3) forms catalytic systems with a 
very wide distribution of their centers with respect to stereospecificity. Typically, 
the amount of n-heptane-insoluble polypropylene obtained with the catalyst is 
ca. 50-80% [32-36] although some authors give an even lower value, ca. 35% 
[26, 37]. Other olefins give similar results [32]. This means that in terms of the 
distribution of centers with respect to isospecificity these catalysts can be compared 
with such systems as Ci-TiCI3-AlEt3 or TiCIcAlEt3 (Figures IV-5, IV-6). 
Performance of the catalysts can be greatly improved if special modifiers are 
added to them (see Sections II-5-e, II-5-f). Most popular among the modifiers are 
esters of aromatic acids (ethyl benzoate, ethyl anisate, methylp-toluate [26, 32-37]) 
and hindered amines [35] although a large number of other compounds were tested 
[35, 36]. Addition of the modifiers invariably brings about two effects: polymeri-
zation activity decreases, sometimes dramatically (up to 10 times [32, 38]), with 
the parallel significant increase in stereospecificity of the catalyst, the fraction of 
crystalline polymer increasing from ca. 50 to 93-98%. Possible mechanisms of this 
action of the modifiers are discussed in Section II -5 and this section gives a general 
description of this effect in quantitative terms. 
Virtually none of the papers dealing with the effect of modifiers on the supported 
catalysts provides any detailed information about the distribution of polyolefin 
stereoregularities similar to that presented in the previous section (see, for example, 
the effect of hex am ethyl phosphoric triamide on the IX-TiCI3-AlEtCI2 system in Fig. 
IV-5). Typically, polyolefins obtained with the catalysts were merely classified as 
fractions that are soluble and insoluble in boiling n-heptane. The insoluble fraction 
(usually defined as isotactic index II) provided a measure of the polymer produced 
on isospecific centers and the second fraction provided a measure of the atactic 
polymer produced on aspecific centers. This means that instead of the model 
distribution function for polymerization centers schematically shown in Fig. IV-6 
an even more simplified model must be assumed. In this model the concentration 
of isospecific polymerization centers, Ciso (Ciso = Nl Co where Co is the total con-
centration of polymerization centers and Nl is the fraction of highly isospecific 
centers as in Fig. IV-6) is considered to be proportional to the yield of the insoluble 
fraction (Q. II). The concentration of aspecific centers Cas = Co(l - N 1) is assumed 
to be proportional to the yield of the soluble fraction, Q(l - II). 
The effects of the amount of a modifier or the [modifier] : [AIR3] ratio on the 
values of the total yield Q and the yields offractions Q. II and Q(l - II) evaluated 
in several studies [26, 32-39] gave partially controversial results. On one hand, all 
published data are unanimous in the finding that the introduction of the modifiers 
invariably results in a decrease of polymer yields Q due to poisoning of some 
fraction of the polymerization centers, i.e., reduction of Co. This effect and possible 
explanations for it are discussed in Section II-5. It is also generally accepted that the 
modifiers are discriminatory in their poisoning of polymerization centers: Cas is 
affected to a much higher degree than Ciso. However, different papers provide 
different quantitative estimations of the discriminative poisoning. For example,

according to Refs. [34] and [37] introduction of ethyl benzoate to the TiCI4 /MgClz-
AlEt3 system (propylene polymerization at 40-60Â°C) reduces Q(l - II) (and sup-
posedly Cas) while the yield of isotactic polymer, Q . II (and Ciso), is either unaffected 
or even increased (Fig. IV-9(AÂ» due to center modification. On the other hand, 
according to Ref. [32], [35], and [36] the modification of such systems is detrimental 
to both Ciso and Cas and the increase in Q . II is merely a result of the preferential 
poisoning of aspecific centers-see Fig. IV -9(B). 
A generalized approach to these phenomena was described in Ref. [36]. It 
provides a simple basis for the semiquantitative comparison of results obtained by 
different authors on the modification of the supported catalysts. In the proposed 
kinetic model only two types of centers are assumed to exist, isospecific (con-
centration Ciso) and aspecific (concentration Cas = Co - Ciso)' For simplicity, only 
stable polymerization centers are considered: Ciso and Cas do not change with time. 
This assumption, while obviously contradicting experimental data (in these systems 
both Ciso and Cas rapidly decrease with time [34, 37,38]), makes the kinetic treatment 
simple and it can be regarded as reasonably valid if one takes into account that both 
Ciso and Cas decrease at similar rates as evidenced by constant II at various reaction 
durations [101]. The expressions for the total polymerization rate, R, the polymeri-
zation rate on the isospecific centers, Riso, the polymerization rate on the aspecific 
centers, RaS' and the isotactic index II can be written as follows: 
(IV-6) 
where kp is the propagation rate constant (equal for all centers) and Cm is the 
monomer concentration. In the absence of a modifier the same equations hold with 
addition of the superscript 0, i.e., Rfso, R~S' lfO, Ci~o, C;'. 
Modification is assumed equivalent to the introduction of a poison (with the 
concentration Cpo) which is distributed between isospecific and aspecific centers in 
the equilibrium 
(IV-7) 
where the subscript p signifies poisoned (inactive toward polymerization) centers. 
This approach to the equilibrium poisoning is similar to that used in Chapter II for 
the description of the effect of multiple organometallic compounds on polymeriz-
ation kinetics. It implies that the concentration of the poison, Cpo, is less than the 
total concentration of polymerization centers Co since the catalyst always remains 
partially active, i.e., Ciso > 0 and Cas> O. (In reality the concentration of a modifier 
is always higher than Co. The fact that the catalysts remain active in the presence of a 
modifier indicates a much more complex situation including equilibrium of the

The following relationships for concentrations of centers are apparent from Eqn. 
IV-7: Cas,p + Ciso,p = Cpo, Ciso,p + C iso = Ci~o, and Cas,p + Cas = C:s . These ex-
pressions, in combination with Eqns. IV-6 and the expression for the equilibrium 
constant K in Eqn. IV -7, provide the following final expression for the interde-
pendence of catalyst activity in the presence of a modifier (R) and in the absence of 
the modifier (RO), and for the polymer isotactic index in the presence of the modifier

calculations with Eqn. IV-S. The case K = 0 corresponds to the situation when only 
aspecific centers are poisoned, an ideal but so far unattainable modifier behavior. 
All data presented in Fig. IV -10 describe a particular catalyst with Ci~o = C:' (equal 
amounts ofisospecific and aspecific centers) which corresponds to lJO = 0.5 (50% 
crystalline polymer produced by the unmodified catalyst). In such a case an 
exclusive poisoning of aspecific centers (K = 0) results in a rapid twofold decrease of 
polymerization activity (when all aspecific centers are inactive) with the simulta-
neous rapid increase of II to 100%. 
In the case of low K values (ca. 0.01-0.02) the situation is similar but the growth 
of II with the reduction of the catalyst activity is less pronounced and even at a very 
high modifier loading (corresponding to very low Rj RO) II never reaches 100%, i.e., 
some aspecific centers remain unpoisoned-see Fig. IV-JO. This example is similar 
to the real behavior of catalysts modified by aromatic acid esters. Figure IV-II 
presents a collection of these data in coordinates of Eqn. IV-S and of Fig. IV-I0. 
Judging by the data, selectivity of the esters in poisoning aspecific centers remains 
unsurpassed except for the effect of some highly sterically hindered amines [35]. A

similar, although less selective, effect was discovered for phenyldimethylcarbinol 
[36]. This is shown in Fig. IV-12. This alcohol rapidly reacts with AIR3 (Reaction 
II-28) and the real modifier in this catalytic system is dialkylaluminum alkoxide 
with the tertiary alkoxy group. Its behavior can be approximately described by Eqn. 
IV-8 with a Kvalue of ca. 0.1-0.08 (see Fig. IV-IO). The limiting II value for this 
modifier (at RjRO -+ 0) is ca. 95% whereas for aromatic acid esters it is ca. 98% (Fig. 
IV-II). A significant number of organic compounds tested in Ref. [36] exhibited a 
similar behavior characterized by a relatively high K value (K,...., 0.2), indicating 
poor selectivity in poisoning isospecific and aspecific centers-compare Figs. IV -10 
and IV -13. The final curve in Fig. IV -10 corresponds to K ,...., I, a behavior typical for 
a hypothetical nondiscriminative poison which equally affects the centers of both 
types. 
The approach represented by Eqn. IV -8 and Fig. IV -10 has several drawbacks. It 
does not take into account possible activation of isospecific polymerization centers 
by a modifier (as shown in Fig. IV-9(AÂ» and it cannot predict experimental 
dependencies of II on RjRO precisely. However, it is convenient for a semiquantita-
tive characterization of modifiers. As soon as the experiment on olefin polymeriza-
tion with the unmodified catalyst is performed and the IIO value is measured, a set 
of II versus Rj RO curves can be easily calculated with Eqn. IV -8 for various values of 
K (Fig. IV-IO shows only one example of such a dependence for IIO = 0.5). After 
this, a few experiments with a particular modifier allow its placement in the plot and 
an approximate estimation of the K value can be made and compared with K values 
for other modifiers.

Molecular Weight Distribution of Polyolefins and the 
Distribution of Propagation Rate Constants 
IV-2-a. 
Explanations for the Wide Molecular Weight Distributions of 
Polyolefins 
Molecular weight distribution (MWD) is an important parameter of any polymer 
product from the technological point of view and it is widely used for the prediction 
of many properties that are important in the processing and subsequent use of 
polymers. MWD has also an important meaning from the mechanistic point of view 
because it has a close relationship with the conditions and kinetics of polymer 
synthesis. 
As follows from the study of olefin polymerization kinetics (Section 1-2), there 
are many examples of polymerizations which follow a very simple overall poly-
merization scheme where the polymerization process is stationary and can be 
described by a simple set of reaction stages including linear initiation, propagation, 

IV-2: Molecular Weight Distribution of Poly ole fins 
347 
and chain transfer reactions (Eqns. 1-3-1-6). If all active centers involved in these 
reactions have similar activity and if the polymerization process is carried out under 
stationary conditions (constant monomer and catalyst concentrations, constant 
temperature,etc.) the theory of MWD [40] predicts that the polymer formed in 
such a process will have an exponential MWD (Flory distribution): 
(IV-9) 
where qiv) is the number distribution function for polymer molecules with respect 
to the polymerization degree v and the parameter a = 1/V where v is the number 
average polymerization degree (see Eqn. 1-13). 
Expressions for the number average molecular weight Mn and the weight average 
molecular weight Mw are 
(IV-I0) 
where Mo is the molecular weight of a monomer unit. 
These formulas predict that MwlMn, the most widely used quantitative MWD 
parameter, is close to 2 for any real polymerization duration. More detailed analysis 
[41] shows that this conclusion holds true even if the active center concentration 
decreases with time. 
Experimental data on the MWD of stereoregular polyolefins and polyethylene 
are in evident contradiction with these theoretical conclusions. Mwl Mn in the case of 
polyolefins and olefin copolymers obtained with heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta 
catalysts is very high, usually from 4-6 to 10-12 and in some cases it may as high as 
20-30 [42-49]. A few examples are presented in Table IV-8. They are obtained by 
the gel permeation chromatography method (GPC) and are typical with respect to 
the Mwl Mn range for different catalytic systems. More detailed information can be 
found in Ref. [50]. It can be seen from Table IV-8 that whereas soluble catalytic 
systems produce polymers with narrow MWD predicted by the theory, all hetero-
geneous catalytic systems, irrespective of their activity (which, for example, varies 
in the first four examples in Table IV-8 in the order AlEt3: AlEt2CI; AlEt2Br 
30: 6: 1 [59]) exhibit wide MWD and in the case of pseudo-homogeneous systems 
the MWD is even wider, probably due to the strong chemical inhomogeneity of the 
active centers. 
This phenomenon can by no means be regarded as an artifact related to the 
difficulties of polyolefin MWD measurement. When such polymer samples undergo

thermal decomposition their Mwl Mn values decrease down to ""' 2 in total agreement 
with the theory [47]. Inhomogeneity in polyolefin stereo regularity (discussed in the 
previous section) cannot account for the wide MWD either: polypropylene frac-
tions, both insoluble and soluble in boiling heptane, also have MwlMn ratios in the 
range 6-12 [25, 39]. 
This wide MWD can, in principle, be described by several empirical weight 
distribution functions qw(v): 
(i) the Wesslau function [42, 43] 

IV-2: Molecular Weight Distribution of Poly ole fins 
where y is a distribution width parameter; y = MolMw 
(ii) the Tung function [44] 
where y and b are distribution width parameters. 
349 
(IV-II) 
(lV-12) 
It is necessary to stress that neither of these functions has any relation to a 
polymerization scheme4 and must be regarded merely as convenient methods for 
the graphical presentation of wide MWD. The Wesslau function allows lineariza-
tion of experimental weight distribution data in probability coordinates and the 
Tung function does this in double logarithmic coordinates [60]. 
The possibility of linearizing experimental MWD data in some particular set of 
coordinates (quite a general procedure in the literature on polyolefin MWD) does 
not yield by itself any kinetic information but rather it serves as a convenient 
method for the numerical computation of the MwlMn values5-see, for example, 
Refs. [44] and [61]-[63] for polyethylene and [11] and [64]-[67] for polypropylene. 
There are two basic explanations for the wide MWD of polyolefins. Explana-
tions of the first type invoke physical phenomena influencing the polymerization 
process and leading to an increase of Mwl Mn ratios, while explanations of the second 
type are based on chemical reasons for it. Before examining these chemical reasons 
(which from the author's point of view are responsible for the MWD broadening) it 
seems pertinent to discuss possible physical explanations. These are primarily 
related to the role of diffusion processes and polymer-solvent interactions in 
polymerization processes [68-73]. Two such approaches examine possibilities of 
equilibrium transitions involving active centers which bear growing polymer chains 
[68, 69]. In Ref. [68] the process of polymer molecule adsorption and desorption 
from the catalyst surface is examined. The desorption reaction results in an entropy 
gain. In Ref. [69] the possibility of the active center equilibrium dissociation is 
considered. In spite of the close resemblance of these two mechanisms they predict 
different effects. According to Ref. [68] the entropy increase is maximal when 
polymer chains with the highest molecular weight migrate into solution (and stop 
growing). This results in a decrease in the amount of the polymer fraction with the 
highest molecular weight and in a MWD narrowing. On the other hand, according 
to Ref. [69] the existence of an equilibrium between growing (associated) polymer 
chains and those in solution (i.e., temporarily "dead" ones) must lead to a MWD 
widening due to the increased probability of secondary association for the longest 
chains and the resumption of chain growth. 
4 The absence of kinetic grounds for these functions manifests itself most clearly in the fact, for example, 
that the Wesslau function gives M. = o. 
5 Empirical functions IV-8 and IV-9 have one important application-the development of mathematical 
models describing olefin polymerization processes with heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts in which 
empirical correlations are examined between the MWD width parameters (y,b) and polymerization 
process parameters (catalyst component concentrations, H2 pressure, temperature, etc.). 

350 
IV: Inhomogeneity of Active Centers 
A general expression for the distribution function qn(v) [60] takes into account 
two different processes: the equilibrium between active centers in solution and on 
the catalyst surface (determined by the adsorption energy and the entropy factor) 
and the diffusion of monomer through a polymer coil to an active center:

(IV-13) 
where F = (E' - B')/RT, B' is the interaction energy for one polymer-catalyst 
adsorption contact, E' is the conformational entropy increase due to the polymer 
molecule solubilization, b is the same parameter as in the Tung function (Eqn. IV-
12, usually b = 1/2-1/3), K = kp,pK/Dm is the coefficient characterizing monomer 
diffusion to an active center (,p-the diffusion flow in the Fick equation, Dm-the 
monomer diffusion coefficient, K-the correlation coefficient between polymer coil 
radius Rand V1/3), and kp is the propagation rate constant. Some important 
particular cases exist giving one the possibility to calculate the Mw/Mn ratio (with 
Eqns. IV-lO) with the application of the distribution function IV-13: 
(i) A polymer is highly soluble in a polymerization medium, and E' Â» B'. This, for 
example, is the case for diene polymerization with heterogeneous 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts with the formation of stereoregular polydienes. In 
such a case the process is governed by the entropy increase accompaning 
macromolecule solubilization and the MWD becomes narrower, i.e., the case is 
analogous to that presented in Ref. [68]. 
(ii) The 8-condition exists, i.e., F = O. The polymerization is governed by mono-
mer diffusion through a polymer coil and the MWD is rather wide correspond-
ing to a Mw/Mn ratio ~ 6. 
(iii) The polymer exhibits poor solubility in the polymerization medium, i.e., 
B' Â» E' and F < O. In this case the dominant effect is the adsorption of a 
polymer "active end" on the catalyst surface. If b = 1/2 this scheme is analog-
ous to the scheme [69] and results in an Mw/Mn value higher than 6. However, 
due to the low polymer solubility, the higher the polymer molecular weight, the 
higher is the volume of the compact shell it forms around the active center and 
this phenomenon will lead to an Mw/Mn decrease. 
The model [60] is very important for description of the MWD in the case of such 
processes as diene polymerization and isobutene polymerization with heterog-
eneous catalysts. The main application of this model is for those polymers which are 
soluble in the reaction medium (a solvent or a liquid monomer) and do not 
crystallize during polymerization. The other important assumption involved is that 
each polymer molecule determines the reactivity of its growing end. For example, a 
growing polymer molecule can block the approach of a monomer molecule to its 
own active center only if the centers are sparsely situated on the catalyst surface. 
Examination of kinetic data on olefin polymerization with heterogeneous 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts (Chapter I) demonstrates that the appropriate require-
ments for control of MWD by physical processes are not met. Such features of the 

IV-2: Molecular Weight Distribution of Polyolefins 
351 
polymerization reaction as the high kinetic stability of some catalysts (sometimes 
for dozens of hours), the constancy of the effective rate constants over a wide 
monomer concentration range, and the high temperature coefficients of the poly-
merization reactions are not consistent with the operation of diffusion processes of 
the type described above. In addition, active center concentrations on catalyst 
surfaces are relatively high and the polymer molecules formed on adjacent centers 
can co-crystallize. This makes it impossible for a given macromolecule to govern 
exclusively the diffusion processes occuring in the vicinity of its own active center. 
Another diffusion model [70] examines monomer diffusion into the porous 
volume of a heterogeneous catalyst. In this model active TiC13-based catalysts are 
regarded as porous solids. These pores appear in the course of the removal of AIC13 
front the ,catalysts. Two variants of the model were discussed [50]. Both models 
predicted wide MWD with MwlMn ratios approaching 10. However, wide MWD is 
typical not only for polyolefins obtained with highly active catalytic systems (usu-
ally containing AIC13) but also for polymers obtained with Ziegler-Natta catalysts 
of low activity that are based on solid ex-TiC13 samples which have never been 
suspected of being porous. This fact does not allow one to regard the idea of intra-
particle diffusion control as the principal explanation for wide MWDs for all olefin 
polym~rization processes. It is necessary to mention here that diffusion processes do 
influence the MWD width in some cases of commercial olefin polymerization when 
highly active catalysts are used [71] but this phenomenon alone cannot explain all 
existing data on polyolefin MWD. 
Finally it is worth mentioning that the application of general formal catalysis 
models (those of Rideal and Langmuir) for the description of MWD in the case of 
uniform surfaces also results in very narrow MWD with MwlMn in the range 1-2 
[74]6 and even the introduction of surface nonuniformity with respect to polymer 
molecule adsorption on active centers does not lead to Mwl Mn values above 3-4 for 
usual molecular weight ranges. 
The insufficiency of different diffusion models in the formulation of a coherent 
quantitative theory explaining wide MWD of polyolefins obtained with hetero-
geneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts is related to the fact that these models do not take 
into account one intrinsic characteristic of practically any heterogeneous catalyst, 
the kinetic nonuniformity of active centers on the catalyst surface. For this reason, 
suggestions were put forward that there exists some distribution of active center 
activities in heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts. This suggestion was first pro-
posed in Ref. [75]. It was speculated that different active centers on the TiC13 surface 
are characterized by different ai values in Eqn. IV -9. If this active center distribution 
with respect to the ai values is described by a distribution function qJ(i), the general 
number distribution function of polymer molecules will be 
qn(V) = LqJ(i)aie- a,.

(IV-l 4) 
6The model discussed in Ref. [74] was developed for ethylene polymerization with chromium oxide 
catalysts and it cannot be applied to olefin polymerization with heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts as 
such because it predicts Mn values proportional to monomer pressure which is not true in our case (see 
Section I-I).

It is easy to see that any MWD function and any MwlMn can be obtained by an 
arbitrary choice of this <p(i) function. As was mentioned previously, the a parameter 
in Eqn. IV-9 is equal to II" and hence to 'Iktlkp where the kt are the various chain 
termination and transfer reaction rate constants and kp is the propagation rate 
constant (see Section I-2-a). It would be interesting to determine which parameter in 
this ratio is influenced most strongly by the nonuniformity of active centers-
propagation or chain termination rate constants. This question can be answered by 
studies on the MWD of stereoregular polymers obtained at low temperatures. 
IV -2-b. 
MWDs of Polypropylene Obtained at Low Temperature 
As was discussed in Chapter I, olefin polymerization with the o-TiCl3-AlEt2 Cl 
system at low temperatures can be described as a "quasiliving" polymerization 
process: after a short initial acceleration stage the polymerization rate becomes 
constant for a substantial time (usually more than one hour) and a linear relation-
ship exists between the number-average molecular weight and the polymer yield 
[76-78]-see Fig. IV-14. When the polymerization duration exceeds one hour the 
molecular weight growth begins to level-off due to the slow process of chain transfer 
to monomer. Thus, the polymerization process at low temperatures can be de-
scribed by the following simple scheme (compare with Eqn. 1-2): 
kÂ· 
Initiation step: 
Cati + M ~ Cat-Polymer (v = 1) 
Propagation steps: Cat-Polymer (v = 1) + M ~ Cat-Polymer (v = 2)

transfer step:

Cat-Polymer (v) + M ~ Cat-Polymer (v + 1)

(IV-IS) 

IV -2: Molecular Weight Distribution of Polyolefins 
353 
The solution of the differential equations corresponding to Eqns. IV -15 [78] by 
the Laplace method under the assumption that kp is constant gave the following 
expression for the number distribution function, qn(v), which represents the sum of 
two functions, one for "dead" polymer chains, Polymer (v), formed after the 
transfer reaction and one for "living" macromolecules, Cat-Polymer (v), still 
growing at the moment of polymerization termination by alcohol: 
(IV-l 6) 
where Co is the concentration of active centers, Cm is the monomer concentration 
which is constant during a run, T is the polymerization duration, a = kt/kp, and b 
= kdkp. The distribution function IV-16 is very narrow. 7 When it is substituted in 
the expressions for average molecular weights (Eqns. IV-IO) the resulting Mw/Mn 
ratios are as follows: 
(i) if a = 0 (no chain transfer reaction, the case of pure living macromolecules) 
Mw/Mn = 1 for high b (for example, b '" 1) and Mw/Mn = 4/3 for low b. 
(ii) if a > 0 (substantial transfer process) the Mw/Mn value is within the 4/3-2 
range. 
Experimental data on the MWD of polypropylene propared at low temperatures 
are in evident disagreement with the distribution function given in Eqn. IV -16. The 
real Mw/Mn value range is 2.5-5 [78]. The difference between the experimental 
distribution data and those calculated with Eqn. IV-16 is explicitly shown in Fig. 
IV-15 where the two weight distribution functions qw(v) are compared. The ex-
perimental qw(v) function was calculated from GPC curves presented in Ref. [78] 
and the theoretical curve was calculated as 
(IV-17) 
withqn(v) given by Eqn. IV-16, with a and b values taken from Ref. [78], andkp ~ 10 
liter/molÂ· min (from Table 1-11). 
The analysis of the kinetic scheme defined by Eqns. IV-15 and the number 
distribution function IV-16 shows that when the initiation reaction is sufficiently 
fast and the chain transfer reaction is relatively insignificant the only possibility to 
reconcile the theory and the MWD data is to assume that different active centers on 
the catalyst surface are characterized by substantially different kp values and that 
7 If Tis large the distribution of Eqn. IV-16 changes to that determined by Eqn. IV-9.

the experimental MWD data (for example, those presented in Fig. IV-IS) are a 
direct reflection of the propagation rate constant variation. Approximate esti-
mations based on the GPC data (see Fig. IV-16) show that the range of kp for 
propylene polymerization at 30Â°C is from - 21iter/molÂ· min to - SOO liter/molÂ· min 
(the average value is -10 liter/molÂ· min from kinetic data).

where s is the parameter of the distribution width.

IV: Inhomogeneity of Active Centers 
It can be seen from the kinetic scheme in Eqns. IV-IS that all reactions involved 
represent the interaction of a monomer molecule and the same active center, 
Cat-Polymer. For this reason it was assumed in Ref. [78] that the rate constants of 
initiation and transfer reactions in Eqns. IV-IS are distributed in the same manner 
as kp, i.e., that both a and b values in Eqn. IV-I6 are constants. In this case 
substitution of Eqns. IV-16 and IV-I8 into Eqn. IV-19, followed by integration 
(assuming for simplicity of calculations that k';ax _ (0) gives [78]:

The introduction of the kp distribution (Eqn. IV-I8) changes the number distri-
bution function from Eqn. IV-16 to the exponential function IV-20 which is 
equivalent to the Flory distribution function IV-9 and gives Mw/Mn = 2 for any 
polymerization duration T. To widen the distribution function even more, the final 
function was chosen in Ref. [78] as the sum of four functions Qn(v), each character-

the GPC data) for two polyethylene samples, one obtained at very short T (IS s)

weight distribution curve for the second sample is very similar to that for polypropy-
lene in Fig. IV-IS (notice the logarithmic abscissa spacing in Fig. IV-I8). As the

number distribution curve for the first sample shows (Fig. IV-18), the polymer 
obtained after 15 s consists mainly of very short macromolecules. However, the 
distribution has a pronounced long molecular weight "tail" up to '" 5 x 105 , i.e., up 
to v = 2 X 104. To produce such polymer molecules in 15 s (assuming no transfer 
reaction took place during this time) the catalyst has to have active centers with kp of 
the order of2.9 x 103 liter/molÂ· S9 to 6 x 103 liter/molÂ· s. This is nearly two orders 
of magnitude higher than the kp for ethylene polymerization at this temperature (80 
liter/molÂ· s, see Table 1-12). These highly active centers constitute ca. 2% of the total 
amount of polymerization centers [63]. Even a higher variation of kp (by up to a 
factor of 103) was found for the supported TiCI4/Mg(OEt)2-AIOct3 catalyst at 
40Â°C [79]. 
Independent data on the active center distribution with respect to kp were 
obtained in experiments on catalyst poisoning with CO and CO2 (see Section II-5-f 
for details) [80, 81]. Some of these data are presented in Table IV-9. It can be seen 
from this table that the centers most susceptible to poisoning with CO2, ca. 40% 
of the total amount of polymerization centers, have kp ca. 3 times higher than the 
average kp values. 
. 
It can be assumed that kp distributions similar to those described above exist in all 
heterogeneous Ziegler~ Natta catalYsts and are responsible for the wide MWDs of 
isotactic polyolefins: In contrast, the narrow MWDs of polyolefins obtained with 
9 Estimations in Ref. [63] are based on Mwl Mn = 5.2 for the polymer fraction with the highest molecular 
weight.

Compositional Inhomogeneity of Olefin Copolymers and 
Active Center Distribution with Respect to Reactivity 
If, as was discussed in the previous section, different active centers of heterogeneous 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts have different reactivities in olefin homopolymerization, it 
is quite conceivable that the reactivities of these centers in olefin copolymerization 
reactions can vary also. This phenomenon has, in fact, been found in practice and it 
results in compositional inhomogeneity of olefin copolymers obtained with these 
catalysts. 
Figures IV-19 and IV-20 contain data on the fractionation of two ethylene-
propylene copolymers having similar compositions. One of the copolymers was 
obtained with the soluble catalytic system V(acach-AlEt2 CI and the second one 
was obtained with the typical heterogeneous system VCI3-AlEt3 . Both copolymers 
were obtained in liquid propylene medium at constant ethylene pressure and were 
similarly fractionated with the p-xylene-ethylcellosolve and o-xylene-n-propyl 
alcohol solvent systems.

Figure IV-20. Distribution of ethylene-propylene copolymer compositions for the product 
obtained with the VCI3-AlEt3 system at 50Â°C (two different polymers obtained under the 
same conditions). Experimental data from Ref. [92]. 
As can be seen from Fig. IV-19, the overwhelming fraction of the copolymer 
product obtained with the soluble catalyst has practically the same composition (the 
precision of copolymer composition measurement is Â±2%). Similar data were 
reported for ethylene-propylene copolymers obtained with the soluble Ti(Oi-
Pr)4-AlEt2F system at 66Â°C [82]. On the other hand, the compositions of the 
copolymer fractions obtained with the heterogeneous catalyst change over a wide 
range (Fig. IV-20). This phenomenon is very typical for copolymers obtained with 
heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts: these products usually have a significant 
distribution of compositions whereas the copolymers obtained with soluble cataly-
tic systems are compositionally uniform [83-89]. 
There are four possible explanations for the copolymer compositional inhomo-
geneity. The first obvious reason for this phenomenon is the change of the feed ratio 
F during a copolymerization run [90]. However, the compositional inhomogeneity 
was also found in the copolymers prepared in low yield or when the monomer ratio 
was constant. Among such examples are the data presented in Figs. IV-19 and 
IV-20: both copolymers were obtained under similar conditions that provided a 
stable copolymerization process (liquid propylene as a reaction medium, constant 
ethylene pressure during both runs, and strict temperature control) and, neverthe-
less, the compositional inhomogeneity of the second product is evident. It should 
also be remembered that, even in the ideal case, different copolymer molecules have 

362 
IV: Inhomogeneity of Active Centers 
different compositions for purely statistical reasons. However, if sufficiently high 
molecular weight products are examined the distribution is narrow enough to be 
neglected [88]. 
One more possible reason for the copolymer compositional inhomogeneity is the 
copolymerization gel-effect [87]. In the course of a copolymerization run a copoly-
mer swells in a solvent and forms a layer surrounding the active centers on the 
catalyst surface. Different monomers have different diffusion coefficients and their 
relative concentrations (and the real F) in the vicinity of an active center will vary 
with the run duration. This effect must necessarily be accompanied by various 
kinetic effects; the copolymerization rate should decrease with time even in the case 
of stable catalytic systems; the copolymer composition should change in the course 
of a copolymerization run; the monomer concentration ratio in the gas phase should 
change during a run, etc. Generally none of these kinetic effects have been noticed in 
the study of olefin copolymerization with heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts. 
Moreover, the compositional inhomogeneity was found also in the copolymers 
obtained at low monomer conversion when possible manifestations of the gel-effect 
have to be minimal. 
The most plausible explanation for the copolymer compositional inhomogeneity 
is the variation of the activity of different active centers on the catalyst surface with 
respect to comonomers, i.e., the existance of different, 1 and '2 values for different 
active centers of the same catalyst10 [86, 88, 91]. 
This hypothesis can be examined on a quantitative level if one assumes [92] that 
this distribution of active centers with respect to, 1 and '2 is continuous and that a 
correlation exists between this distribution and the distribution of center isospecifi-
cities (discussed in Section IV -1). It is evident that this correlation for a particular 
fraction of active centers (a correlation between the '1 and '2 values and R 
= kiso/ksyndio) cannot be determined directly by the study of copolymer and homo-
polymer products obtained with the same catalytic system because it is impossible 
to determine which copolymer fraction (characterized by particular '1 and '2) was 
obtained in a copolymerization reaction on the same active centers as some homo-
polymer fraction (characterized by a particular R value) in a homopolymerization 
reaction with the same catalyst. Nevertheless, quantitative information about the R 
versus'1,'2 correlation can be obtained if one assumes that this correlation is more 
or less universal for a wide group of Ziegler-Natta catalysts involving the same or 
similar transition metals. Table IV -10 contains some data on the, 1 and, 2 values for 
different Ziegler-Natta catalytic systems (copolymerization of ethylene and pro-
pylene) and the R values for propylene homopolymerization with the same systems 
(from Ref. [95]). 
This table includes also kDE/kDD-the ratio of rate constants for ethylene and 
propylene (isotactic) addition to a growing chain with the propylene unit on its 
growing end. This value can be calculated using the formulas for copolymer 
lÂ°This hypothesis raises serious questions about the kinetic meaning ofrl and'2 values in the case ofa 
multi-center mechanism and about the feasibility of the application ofr1'2 products to characterize the 
monomer unit distribution in the copolymers obtained with heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts (see 
Sections 111-4-b and 111-I I). These problems are discussed on a quantitative level in Refs. [84], [88], [93], 
and [94].

The comparison of Rand kDE/kDD in Table IV-IO shows that a correlation exists 
between the relative activities of the catalytic centers in copolymerization reactions 
and their stereospecificities: the lower the R value, the higher the relative rate of 
ethylene addition to a copolymer chain, in comparison with propylene addition. 
This correlation is presented in Fig. IV-21 in coordinates of kDE/kDD versus I/R

centers on the surface of the VCI3-AlEt3 catalyst and that the '1'2 value is the same 
for all active centers of a given catalyst 11 [92] the following correlation between, 1,

(IV-2S) 
Equation IV-2 shows that the catalytic center distribution on '1 and '2 is 
determined by these centers' distribution on R. This last distribution is presented in 
Fig. IV -3. As was discussed in Section IV-I-a, it can be conveniently described (Eqn. 
IV-I) as the sum of the fraction of highly isospecific centers (N1 = 0.3) and the 
fraction of centers with a continuous distribution of the (IjR) parameter, as de-
scribed by Eqn. IV-2, with the distribution parameter a = 7-8. 
To simulate the experimental data on the compositional distribution of a copoly-
mer obtained with the VCI3-AlEt3 system (Fig. IV-IS) one has to derive ex-
pressions for the composition of a copolymer fraction and its amount. Following 

IV -3: Compositional Inhomogeneity of Olefin Copolymers

Ref. [92], the expression for the composition of a fraction can be obtained from the 
general expression for copolymer composition (Eqn. III-46) and the expressions for 
'1 and'2 (Eqns. IV-25) assuming '1'2 equal to ",0.5 (see Table IV-lO):

The rate of copolymerization is [92]:

The stationary weight rate of copolymer formation is: 
(IV-27) 
(IV-28) 
where f is the copolymer composition ratio and ME and Mp are the molecular 
weights of ethylene and propylene (28 and 42). 
Preliminary calculations showed that variation of the kDD/kED ratio in Eqn. 
IV-27 in the 0.4-1.0 range did not significantly alter the estimations of Reop. If 
one assumes kDD/kED = I and introduces expressions for Reop (Eqn. IV-2) and for 
f(Eqn. 1II-46), into Eqn. IV-28 with '1'2 = 0.5 the final expression for Rweight is 
(IV-29) 
kDD in Eqns. IV-27 and IV-29 is the average isotactic propagation rate constant for 
centers with a given stereospecificity. Following Ref. [33] this parameter was 
assumed to be independent of R (the same assumption as in Section IV-I). The 
expression for the cumulative weight of the sum of copolymer fractions obtained on 
the fraction of active centers with R values ranging from I (centers producing

and IV-2 with parameters Nl = 0.3, a = 7- 8), l/Rmin = 0.05 (Fig. IV-3), and the 
expression for Rweight is presented in Eqn. IV-29. 
Calculations of copolymer fraction compositions (Eqn. IV -26) and their cumula-
tive weight (Eqn. IV-30) were carried out with the application of the empirical '2 
versus R correlation (Eqns. IV -25). The results of these calculations are compared 
in Fig. IV -22 with experimental data on the copolymer composition inhomogeneity 
(the same data as in Fig. IV-20). The region between the two calculated curves in 
Fig. IV-22 corresponds to the zone of the correlation between'2 and R values (Fig. 
IV-21) described by the linear boundaries in Eqn. IV-24. 
The agreement of the experimental and calculated distributional data in Fig. 
IV-22 is very satisfactory, allowing the suggestion that the assumptions involved

in the quantitative model for the copolymer compositional distribution (primarily 
the suggestion of the correlation between r 1 and r 2 of the active centers and their 
stereospecificity characteristics R) are valid. 
As was mentioned before, the phenomenon of the compositional inhomogeneity 
of the olefin copolymers obtained with heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts is 
quite general. A few examples of this copolymer inhomogeneity are presented 
below: 
(i) Data on the fractionation of l-hexene-4-methyl-I-pentene copolymers ob-
tained with the b-TiCI3-AlEt2CI system at 50Â°C at low conversions Â« 10%) 
are shown in Table IV-II (from Ref. [98]). 
(ii) Another similar example is the propylene-4-methyl-I-pentene copolymer 
obtained with the b-TiCI3-AlEt2CI catalytic system at 70Â°C [99]-see Table 
IV-12. 
(iii) Significant compositional distribution was found also for copolymers of sub-
stituted styrenes obtained with the oc-TiCI3-Ali-Bua catalytic system at 75Â°C 
[100]. The composition ranges of the copolymer fractions found for styrene-
p-tert-butylstyrene copolymers (conversion 7.4%) were from 42 to 92 mol % 
styrene; for styrene-o-methylstyrene copolymers (conversion 12.3 %), from 60

(iv) Compositional distribution was found to be especially wide for copolymers of 
styrene and (S)-4-methyl-l-hexene obtained with the TiC14-Ali-Bu3 catalyst 
at 20 DC [102]. Although these comonomers have similar reactivities (r1= 0.76, 
r2 = 1.65) and the copolymers were obtained at low conversions their fractio-
nation revealed components ranging from nearly pure polystyrene to nearly 
pure poly-(S)-4-methyl-l-hexene (see Table IV-13).

Chapter V 
Mechanism of Isospecific Olefin 
Polymerization 
Introduction 
The term "a mechanism of a chemical reaction," especially when applied to such 
complex a process as olefin polymerization with heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta 
catalysts, can have several meanings: 
(i) A reaction mechanism as a sequence of chemical reactions involved in an 
overall polymerization process (the kinetic mechanism). 
(ii) Chemical structure of active species and the nature of reactions between them 
and olefins (the chemical mechanism). 
(iii) Principal electronic characteristics of active species and electronic features of 
the polymerization steps (the electronic mechanism). 
(iv) In the case of stereospecific polymerization there is an additional important 
feature of the reaction, the characteristics of active species or of the polymeri-
zation step which make possible the formation of stereoregular polymers (the 
steric mechanism). 
The first aspect of this mechanism, the kinetic mechanism, was discussed in 
Chapters I and III. The sequence of chemical reactions leading to the formation of 
polyolefin chains is relatively simple and includes initiation, propagation, and 
several chain termination reactions (see Reactions 1-3-1-7). The chain propagation 
step, mechanistically the most important of these reactions, is a kinetically simple 
reaction of olefin addition to a growing polymer chain. It includes the opening of a 
double bond and the formation of a new carbon-carbon single bond:

This reaction is strongly favored from a thermodynamic point of view (!1H~98 ~ 
- 25 kcal/mol) and is completely irreversible. The majority of the reactions involved 
in the formation of a polymer chain follow the "head-to-tail" addition scheme-see 
Secti on III-I. 
This chapter is devoted to the discussion of chemical, electronic, and steric 
mechanisms of olefin polymerization which emerge from recent experimental data 
on the polymerization reactions discussed in this book. Historic reviews of many 
polymerization mechanisms suggested for this reaction over the past 25 years can 
be found in Ref. [1-3].

Chemical Mechanism of Olefin Polymerization: Olefin 
Insertion Reaction into the O"-Metal-Carbon Bond 
Two problems are of the greatest importance in the discussion of the "chemical" 
polymerization mechanism: the chemical structure of the polymerization centers 
present in heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts and the nature of the interaction 
between these centers and olefin molecules. As was discussed in Section II-3 direct 
experimental data on the structure of the products of the reaction between solid 
transition metal halides and organometallic compounds are scarce and incon-
clusive. The only species directly detectable in these products are chemisorbed 
organometallic compounds in monomeric and dimeric states (which do not poly-
merize olefins) and Ti3 + atoms situated in lattice defects. Their ESR spectra change 
in the presence of olefin molecules. 
Chemical evidence is more detailed (see Section II-2). The interaction of transi-
tion metal halides with organometallic compounds results in a rapid exchange 
reaction between halogen atoms of the solid products and organic groups of the 
organometallic compounds. The exchange includes a significant fraction of the 
halogen atoms on the catalyst surface, in the case of the gas-phase interaction, or 
virtually all of them in the case of the solid-solution interaction. Organic derivatives 
of transition metals formed in this reaction are not stable and they partially 
decompose with transition metal reduction, usually from M3+ to M2+. Both the 
organic derivatives of transition metals and their reduced species form complexes 
with all organometallic compounds present in such systems. 
This leaves one with two most probable candidates for the role of polymerization 
centers: organic derivatives of transition metals and chemisorbed organometallic 
(e,g., organoaluminum) compounds. The exact chemical structures of these pro-
ducts on the catalyst surface have never been established with certainty and numer-
ous speculations exist in the literature about their composition and the type of 
interaction between these compounds and the crystal lattice supporting them. 
Several of these proposed structures are discussed later. 
Direct experimental studies of heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts also pro-
vide no straightforward information on the chemical mechanism of olefin trans-
formation into polymer (Section II-3). The most significant direct data on this 
subject were obtained in the study of ethylene polymerization with soluble

V: Mechanism of Isospecific Olefin Polymerization 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts. The best studied of these catalysts is the combination of 
(CsHsh TiCl2 with AlR2Cl (R = Me, Et, etc.). Activity of this system in ethylene 
polymerization in benzene or toluene solutions was discovered more than two 
decades ago [4-6]. The principal chemical features of this system are well studied 
and strongly resemble reactions of heterogeneous catalysts [7]: 
(i) Complex formation: 
(V-2) 
(ii) Alkylation of the Ti compound: 
(V-3) 
(iii) Reduction of the alkylated Ti product: 
(V-4) 
This three-stage scheme represents only a very rough description of the real 
reaction, which includes equilibrium stages of complex formation and rearrange-
ment. Two features of this scheme were, however, established with certainty: 
(i) The formation of the alkylated Ti derivative (CsHsh TiRCl (R = Me, Et). 
These compounds are relatively stable at or below room temperature and were 
isolated in a pure state. The Ti-R bond dissociation energy in (CSHS)2 TiEtCl 
is 35 kcaljmol [8, 9]. These compounds by themselves do not polymerize 
ethylene in solution but they do it readily when combined with acidic 
organoaluminum compounds [10-15]. 
(ii) The final product of (CsHsh TiC12 reduction, the complex (CSHS)2 TiClÂ· 
AIRC12 containing Ti3 +, is catalytically inactive in ethylene polymerization 
[5-7, 15, 16]. Reaction V-4 is the reaction of polymer chain termination if 
R = polymer chain. 
The exact chemical nature of acidic organoaluminum compounds which can 
activate (CsHsh TiRCl is still the subject of substantial controversy. Possible 
candidates include AlEtC12 [to-15], AIC13 [17], and products of the interaction of 
AlEtC12 with water (possibly aluminoxanes) [II, 12, 17-21]. 
A 13C-NMR study was carried out on the (CsHsh TiRCl-AlEtC12 (R = Me, 
Et) catalytic system at low temperatures and of the interaction of this system with 
ethylene [21, 22]. Figure V-I shows the 13C NMR spectra of AlEtC12, 
(C2HSh TiEtCl, and their 2 : 1 mixture in octadeuterotoluene at - 53Â°C together 
with the peak assignments. Mixing of (CSHS)2 TiEtCl and AlEtCl2 results in the 
formation of two complexes as judged by the appearance of two peaks due to the 
CsHs moiety, as well as of two pairs ofCH2 and CH 3 peaks of the Al-Et group. 
One of these complexes (that characterized by the CsHs peak at 0-118.8 ppm) is the 
primary complex formed by the components of this system with the most probable

indicate no participation of this group in any interaction with ethylene.

C2HS bond: 
(Y-6) 
The high intensity of these peaks is explainable if one takes into account that 
the [C2H4] : [Ti] ratio in this mixture is close to 1 : 1. Small peaks at <5-23.1 and 
14.3 ppm in this spectrum are assigned correspondingly to y-CH2 and CH3 
groups in the new Ti-C4H9 bond. 
(vi) Data on peak areas in the spectrum shown in Fig. V-2 indicate that at a 
[C2H4] : [Ti] ratio of 1 : 1 at - 63Â°C, ,.., 30% of ethylene is consumed in Reac-
tion V-6, the remaining ethylene being either unconverted or consumed in 
further insertion reactions of the type V -6 with the formation of short alkyl 
chains (C6H 13, CgH17' etc.) bound to Ti. Peaks of the carbon atoms belonging 
to these chains are situated at <5-30.7 ppm for (C3H7)-CH2-
and <5-23 ppm 
for (C2HS)-CH2-groups-see Fig. V-2. 
The soluble catalytic system described above differs in two important features 
from heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts. Its active center, Complex V-5, con-
tains Ti4+ rather than Ti3+ or Ti2+ which are typical for heterogeneous catalysts. 
The system can only polymerize ethylene or copolymerize it with other ee-olefins. All 
attempts to obtain homopolymers of higher ee-olefins with it have failed3: the 
reaction between the soluble catalyst and an olefin molecule CH2=CHR proceeds 
as [25] 
(Y-7) 
Nevertheless, the data presented in Ref. [21] and [22] can be regarded as appar-
ently the most direct evidence in favor of the suggestion made by many authors a 
long time ago [1, 2] that the polymerization reaction of ee-olefins with heterogeneous 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts represents the insertion reaction of an olefin molecule into 
z A similar effect-the disappearance of the (Ti)-CH 3-group signal in the lH-NMR spectrum of 
(CsHsh TiMeCIÂ· AIMeCI2 in the presence of phenylacetylene was described in Ref. [24]. The (Al)-
CH3-group peak does not change in this reaction.

the transition metal-carbon bond. Whereas many diverging opinions can be found 
in the literature about particular features of polymerization centers, this concept of 
the olefin insertion reaction is accepted virtually unanimously. 
One of the recently proposed alternative insertion mechanisms includes an 
intermediate carbene complex [27]:

This mechanism assumes secondary olefin addition to a metal-carbon bond in 
heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts, which is contrary to numerous experi-
mental data suggesting primary insertion (see Section III-I). The modification of 
this mechanism assuming primary insertion and a H-M=CH-polymer carbene 
derivative was also rejected [28] because the first step of the propylene polymeri-
zation reaction with the labeled M-13CH3 group would result in the scrambling 
of the label

whereas only -CH2-CH(CH3) 13CH3 groups were discovered spectroscopically 
in polypropylene obtained with the TiCI3-AW 3CH3hI system. This suggests that 
propylene inserts into a U-M_13CH3 bond in complete accord with the data for 
soluble catalysts: 
(V-IO) 
Ability of catalytic systems including metal-phenyl bonds, e.g., 0-TiCI3-AIPh3 
or o-TiCI3-ZnPh2' to polymerize olefins isospecifically [91] also excludes the car-
bene mechanism because the first step in Reaction V -8is impossible in the case of the 
Ti-Ph bond. 
An additional confirmation of the existence ofthe insertion reaction was found 
when the gas-phase reaction between the CH3 TiCl2 + ion and olefins was studied 

V-2: Intimate Mechanism of the Olefin Insertion Reaction 
379 
using the ion cyclotron resonance drift technique [29]. CH3 TiCl2 + species were 
generated as the major product in the course of the CH3 TiCl3 fragmentation at 
25Â°C in the gas phase. Admission of ethylene resulted in the following reaction 
(V-II) 
When this reaction was carried out with C2D4 the predominant products were 
C3H2D3 TiCl2 + and HD. Similarly, in reaction with propylene CH3 TiCl2 + gave 
C4H7 TiCl2 + and H2. Neither of these secondary Ti-containing ions reacts with 
olefins. 
The reaction scheme accounting for the gross reaction in Eqn. V-II is a two-step 
process. The first step is the insertion reaction: 
This ion in the gas phase cannot dispose of its excess internal energy in any way and 
undergoes unimolecular decomposition:

Some indirect evidence also supports the idea of olefin insertion into the u-bond 
between a transition metal atom and a carbon atom. According to Ref. [3] the 
most convincing evidence is based on olefin polymerization with metal alkyl-free 
catalysts (e.g., with pure TiCI2). Although polymerization rates with these catalysts 
are lower than in the presence of organometallic compounds, the alkyl-free catalysts 
share many features with typical heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts, including 
their stereo regulative ability (see Section 1II-6). Another indirect proof of the olefin 
insertion mechanism is the polymerization of olefins in the presence of CH3 TiCl3 
used as an organometallic compound. Whatever the interaction between RTiCl3 
and the transition metal halide may be, the only metal-carbon bonds envisaged in 
these systems involve the participation of titanium atoms. 
V -2. 
Intimate Mechanism of the Olefin Insertion Reaction 
Olefin insertion reaction into a metal-carbon bond is an exotic reaction which is felt 
to be much more complex than other known reactions of olefin polymerization: 

380 
V: Mechanism of Isospecific Olefin Polymerization 
double bond interaction with free radicals or free ions. Kinetic comparison shows 
that this reaction proceeds with a rate constant from ~ 10 times less (for ethylene) to 
several thousands times less (for styrene) than corresponding radical polymeriza-
tion reactions and it is many orders of magnitude slower than corresponding free 
ionic reactions-see Tables I -II and 1-12. Detailed data on olefin copolymerization 
demonstrate (Section I -S-b) that electronic characteristics of alkyl groups attached 
to a transition metal atom apparently do not influence the reactivity of the 
metal-carbon bond whereas the steric structure of both the alkyl group R' and an 
olefin molecule in the insertion reaction 
(V-I4) 
have a profound effect on this reaction indicating substantial space limitations in 
the transition state. 
No explicit data on the intimate mechanism of any model reaction of olefin 
insertion into a transition metal-carbon bond are available in the literature up to 
now4 [27, 30] and the only relevant information, however remote, about insertion 
reactions into such bonds is related to CO insertion into the Mn-C [31-33] and 
W-CH3 bonds [27, 30] as well as ethylene insertion into the W-H bond [27,30]. It 
has been demonstrated that in all these cases the insertion reaction proceeds only 
when the nucIeophile molecule is initially coordinated to a transition metal atom 
rather than with a free nucIeophile: 
(V-IS) 
This suggests that olefin coordinates with polymerization centers of heterogeneous 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts prior to insertion into the transition metal-carbon bond-
an idea discussed in the literature for a long time (see reviews [1-3]).

Olefin Coordination

This coordination is usually envisaged as n-complex formation between the 
occupied n-orbital of an olefin molecule (and possibly its antibonding n*-orbital) 
4 The 13C_ NMR data on ethylene insertion into the Ti-C bond [21,22], discussed in the previous section, 
provide no mechanistic information about this reaction apart from the proof of its occurrence.

and the orbitals of the transition metal atom. It should be noted that no direct 
evidence exists confirming the formation of such complexes in the case of hetero-
geneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts. However, several important indirect findings 
permit one to regard this reaction as highly probable. 
First of all, the formation of olefin n-complexes with many transition metal 
compounds is well known. The electronic structure of such complexes can be 
visualized on a qualitative level according to a well-known two-bond scheme [34]. 
(V-17) 
The first donor-acceptor bond (a-bond) is formed between the filled n orbital of 
an olefin molecule and the empty orbital (e.g., dX 2_y 2 orbital) of the transition metal 
atom. If the metal atom has electrons in another d-orbital (e.g., on the dxy orbital) a 
second bond is formed (n-bond) between this filled orbital and the empty n* 
antibonding olefin orbital resulting in back-donation of electrons from the metal 
atom to the olefin molecule. According to Ref. [35] such n-complexes can be 
classified according to the relative importance of these two components in the total 
metal-olefin bond as shown in Table V-I. 
Many such stable olefin complexes with Cu, Ag, Au, Ni, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ir, Ru, Os, 
and Re are known [33]. On the other hand, no stable and well-characterized olefin 
complexes of Ti, V, and Cr in high oxidation states are described in the literature. 
These metals have empty or poorly filled d orbitals and their complexes with olefins, 
if formed in a transition stage of an olefin insertion reaction [Reaction V -16] should 
be oftype II, i.e., they should contain mainly donor n( olefin) ~ M bonds (see details 
in Section V-3). 
Numerous experimental data provide evidence for the phenomenon of reversible 
poisoning of heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts by compounds with electron-
donor properties. Several examples of such poisoning by CO, CO2 , acetylene, and 
allene are described in Section II-5-h. These compounds do not interact with 
organometallic compounds under conditions typical for olefin polymerization and 
they can be removed from a poisoned polymerization system either by evacuation 
(CO, CO2) or through very slow copolymerization with olefins (acetylene, allene). 
In both cases polymerization activity can be restored to a substantial degree after 
removal of the poison. This behavior can be easily explained if one assumes that 
polymerization centers have special vacancies which are occupied by olefin mole-
cules before their incorporation into polymer molecules via the insertion reaction 
(Eqn. V-16) and that the above mentioned poisons readily coordinate on these

vacancies, preventing olefins from polymerization but leaving the centers virtually 
intact. Careful studies with labeled poisons demonstrated (see Section II-S-h) that 
both CO and CO2 can very slowly incorporate into polyolefin chains. It was 
suggested that this reaction represents the insertion of complexed CO and CO2 into 
the transition metal-carbon bond (Reaction II-4S) much in the same way as CO 
inserts into the Mn-CH3 bond (Reaction V-IS). This parallel adds credit to the 
assumption that olefin coordination with n-complex formation is the preliminary 
stage of olefin insertion into the transition metal-polymer bond (Reaction V-16). 
Data on the variation of polypropylene stereoregularity with temperature dis-
cussed in Section III-8 also favor strongly the assumption that the interaction of 
olefin with a polymerization center has multiple stages and includes two alternative 
reversible olefin coordination stages which are followed by the insertion of the 
coordinated olefin (Reaction III-66). As follows from Fig. III-l7, when the iso-
addition of propylene to a polymer chain (the dominant type of polymerization 
reaction) occurs energy barriers for olefin coordination and its subsequent insertion 
are close. As a consequence, olefin reactivity in these reactions is influenced both by 
the structure of the olefin molecule itself and by the steric structure of the last 
monomer unit in a growing chain (Section I-S-b). 
Thus, the body of experimental data on different features of olefin polymeri-
zation with heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts derived from different sources 
(polymerization kinetics, stereospecificity of catalytic systems, olefin reactivity in 
copolymerization reactions, catalyst poisoning etc.), as well as paral1els with the 
mechanism of the CO insertion reaction, indicate the existence of an olefin coordi-
nation step prior to the olefin insertion reaction. 
Kinetic data discussed in Sections J-2-a and 1-8 show that this coordination 
complex is unstable (as would be expected for a complex of a transition metal with 
low occupancy of the 3d electronic shell) and its formation is virtually not mani-
fested kinetically: the first-order dependence of polymerization rate on ethylene and

propylene concentration was established over a very wide range of monomer 
concentrations (see Section I-I), i.e., the proposed n-complexes do not accumulate 
in such systems to any appreciable extent. A quantitative discussion of this problem 
can be found in Section II-S. Only recently the decrease of the order of the 
polymerization reaction with respect to monomer concentration down to zero order 
at 30Â°C for styrene polymerization with the VCI3-Ali-Bu3 system [36] was reported. 
This indicates that the styrene-V n-coordination complex is relatively stable under 
these conditions. Another example of such a change in the reaction order with 
respect to monomer concentration occurs when propylene is polymerized with the 
soluble V(acach-AlEt2Cl system at -78Â°C. Even under these conditions the 
reaction order changes from first to zero order only when the propylene con-
centration is > 5 mol/liter [37]. This explains why no direct experimental confirm-
ation of the n-complex formation was found in the case of heterogeneous 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts (see Section II-3). 
V -2-b. 
Geometry of Olefin Coordination 
Ifthe preliminary olefin coordination stage is considered for olefin insertion (Reac-
tion V -16) the evident questions are-what is the nature of the coordination 
position at the transition metal atom and what is its fate in the course of the insertion 
reaction? Although no experimental data exist to answer these questions directly 
three schemes have been considered in the literature. It should be emphasized that in 
the following discussion, the detailed structure of a polymerization center with all 
ligands attached to it is not examined rigorously and the main point of interest is the 
discussion of the relative positions of three entities: the transition metal atom, the 
polymer chain attached to it, and the approaching monomer molecule. It is usually 
assumed that the coordination around the transition metal atom in a polymeri-
zation center is similar to that in transition metal halides (Section II-I-a). 
Six-Coordinate Transition Metal with One Vacancy. 
This model was presented in 
Refs. [3S]-[40] and due to its thorough development and appeal it is widely accepted. 
According to this model (Fig. V-3) the transition metal atom in a p.olymerization 
center has the coordination number 6. Four of these coordination positions are 
occupied by halogen atoms, the fifth one by the end of a growing polymer chain, and 
the sixth one is vacant and available for monomer coordination-see Fig. V-3. 
After monomer coordination at the vacant site and its subsequent insertion the 
polymerization center regenerates but with the vacancy in the position previously 
occupied by the growing chain. The last step, the vacancy migration, restores the 
initial structure. 
The first and the second steps of this scheme, coordination and insertion of an 
olefin molecule, are generally accepted. However, the postulation of the six-
coordinate metal atom and the requirement that the structure ofthe polymerization 
center be restored (a prerequisite for maintaining isospecific olefin addition to the 
polymer chain-see Section V-4) resulted in the introduction of the vacancy mi-
gration step. This is presumably a unimolecular rearrangement reaction with a

substantial activation barrier (the transition metal-carbon bond has a predomi-
nantly covalent character) involving a complicated cooperative movement of a 
segment of a polymer chain [41]. 
A modification of the reaction scheme presented in Fig. V-3 which avoids the 
chain migration step was discussed in Ref. [41]. According to this modification both 
vacancies in the center, the first one existing initially and the second one formed 
immediately after olefin insertion, are equivalent energetically and monomer co-
ordination occurs at these sites alternatively if their steric arrangements are similar 
and allow an olefin molecule to approach the center. 
Another difference between these models of olefin insertion as discussed in Refs. 
[38]-[40] and in Ref. [41] is the geometry of olefin coordination. According to the 
model of Refs. [38-40] a monomer molecule coordinates to the center with its 
double bond parallel to the M-polymer bond (as shown in Fig. V-3) p(oviding 
facile C-C bond formation in the transition step whereas in the model of Ref. [41] 
the olefin double bond originally is perpendicular to the M-polymer bond and 
rotates to the parallel position in the transition state. 
Six-Coordinate Transition Metal with Two Vacancies. 
A detailed examination of 
the active center model shown in Fig. V-3 which takes into consideration the steric 
arrangement of a polymer chain in the vicinity of the center [42] reveals that the 
vacancy shown in Fig. V-3 will be strongly shielded by the polymer molecule and 
will be virtually inaccessible for olefin coordination-see later, Fig. V-21. It was 
suggested [42] that the polymerization center has two vacancies: one shielded by the 
polymer chain and the second one open for olefin coordination. A scheme involving 
such a center and its reaction with olefin are presented in Fig. V -4. In this figure the 
vacancy shielded by the polymer chain is depicted by a crossed square, the open 
vacancy is shown as an open square, and the polymer chain is shown as a helical 
segment.

According to Ref. [42], this shielding is mainly due to CH2 and CH3 groups of the 
second monomer unit in the chain (see Fig. V-21), the CH 2 group (a y-carbon atom 
of the main chain) being the closest to the metal atom. 
After the first monomer coordination and the insertion step (which proceeds in 
the same way as in Fig. V-3) are over, the end of the growing polymer chain shifts to 
a new position and the previously blocked vacancy becomes open and available for 
monomer coordination. Simultaneously, a new vacancy appears (same as in Fig. 
V-3) which is shielded by the polymer chain. This process can be repeated many 
times. At any moment of time the center has two vacancies, one shielded and one 
open, but the steric shielding of these vacancies alternates, allowing monomer 
coordination at any open vacancy exactly in the same fashion with respect to the 
growing chain. The metal in this center is formally in a more reduced state than in 
the center with one vacancy.s 
5 According to Refs. [40] and [43] three of the halogen atoms in the center with one vacancy (Fig. V-3) are 
shared with other transition metal atoms in the same way as in the TiCl3 lattice (see Section II-I-a) and 
they formally have a valency equal to!. The fourth halogen atom is connected solely to the center. These 
four atoms together with the u-M-C bond make the formal valency of the metal atom equal to 3! . The 
formal valency of the metal atom in the center with two vacancies (Fig. V-4) counted similarly is 2!.

Figure V -5. Mechanism of polymer chain growth on the trigonal bipyramidal center. 
The proximity of a polymer chain to the transition metal atom in a center with 
two vacancies, at the point where the chain shields one of the vacancies, makes 
possible the formation of a nonconventional donor-acceptor bond between the 
saturated y-carbon atom of the chain and the transition metal atom in which 
bonding orbitals of the alkyl chain act as quasi-uncharged electron pairs. The 
possibility of such C-M bonding was revealed in comparative MO calculations of 
Cl3 TiCH3 , Cl3 TiCzHs, and TiC3 H 7 groups [44-47]. Such additional bonding, 
however weak, permits one to regard growing polymer chains as bidentate ligands 
with a weak second donor component. 
Steric features of olefin polymerization with the centers shown in Figs. V-3 and 
V-4 are discussed in Section V-4 and their electronic structure is discussed in Section 
V-3. 
Trigonal Bipyramidal Active Center. 
This model is described in detail in Refs. 
[46]-[48]. It represents the polymerization center as a quasi-trigonal bipyramidal 
complex with no apparent vacancy at its transition metal atom-see Fig. V-5. 
When an olefin molecule approaches such a center the end atoms of the polymer 
chain begin to move away from the olefin molecule (remaining in'the plane formed 
by two X atoms and the end carbon atom of the chain) and a weak coordination 
bond forms between the olefin molecule and the transition metal atom. This results 
in a quasi-octahedral transition metal complex. After breaking of the olefin C=C 
and the M-C bonds and the formation of new C-C and M-C bonds (in total 
constituting olefin insertion into the M -C bond), the original quasi-trigonal 
bipyramidal structure of the polymerization center is restored. Quantum mechan-
ical aspects of this model are discussed in Section V-3. 
Conformation of Alkyl Groups in a Coordinated Olefin Molecule. 
When coordina-
tion of a higher olefin molecule is considered one more problem arises in addition to 
the geometry of the coordinated double bond. This is the problem of the conforma-
tion of the olefin alkyl group in a coordinated olefin molecule. It is known that at 
temperatures typical for olefin polymerization with heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta 
catalysts all possible conformations of alkyl chains in gaseous or dissolved mole-
cules are populated depending on their equilibrium energies due to the low acti-
vation barriers for internal rotation around single C-C bonds. The most stable

conformation of the C(2)-C(3) bond in alpha-olefins depends on the alkyl group 
branching: R-anti for olefins with no 3-substituents and H-syn for 3-alkyl-sub-
stituted olefins:

However, these conformations can change in a coordination state due to the 
steric requirements in the vicinity of a transition metal atom. Analysis of 13C_ NMR 
spectra of copolymers of 3-alkyl-l-pentenes and those of poly-3-methyl-l pentene 
[49,50] suggested that in the case of 3-alkyl-substituted olefins (which usually show 
low activity in iso-specific polymerization due to steric hindrance of their alkyl 
groups-see Section I-5-b), the preferred conformation of alkyl groups in the 
coordinated state deviates from H-syn and most probably is close to H-skew, the 
conformation allowing the least space limitation for the double bond coordination. 
V -2-c. 
Lability of the Transition Metal-Carbon Bond and the Insertion of 
Coordinated Olefin into It 
An olefin molecule, after coordination with the transition metal atom in a poly-
merization center (the first stage of Reacti.on V -16), easily inserts into the transition 
metal-carbon bond of the center (the second-stage of Reaction V -16). The ease of 
this insertion reaction is indicated by the high values of the propagation rate 
constants for olefin polymerization reactions (see Tables 11-7-11-9) and by the 
kinetic analysis of olefin polymerization (Section 11-8). On the other hand, a similar 
olefin insertion into an Al-C bond is a much more difficult process [51]. 
It was suggested originally that the high reactivity of the transition metal-carbon 
bond is determined by the decrease of the energy of the bond after olefin coordina-
tion [40] (see later in Section V-3-a). However, a later more rigorous theoretical 
analysis did not confirm this suggestion [46, 48] and indicated that olefin coordi-
nation does not alter the properties of the transition metal-carbon bond to any 
significant extent. Thermochemical estimates of the energy of the transition 
metal-carbon bonds [52, 53] conclusively demonstrated that the dissociation 
energies of these bonds are quite large and are not appreciably less than those of 
non-transition metal-carbon bonds (Si-C, Ge-C, Sn-C) in compounds of similar 

388 
V: Mechanism of Isospecific Olefin Polymerization 
structure. Consistent with the high bond dissociation energies of transition metal-
carbon bonds in Ziegler-Natta catalysts is the fact that they are not thermally 
labile: some of the reported catalysts exhibit a nearly stable polymerization be-
havior for at least 1 h at temperatures as high as IOOÂ°C, and several reports exist of 
olefin polymerization with Ziegler-Natta catalysts at temperatures higher than 
200Â°C [54]. 
This contradiction between high thermodynamic stability of transition metal-
carbon bonds and their high kinetic lability in olefin polymerization reactions 
has been explained [55] as a consequence of the "triplet instability" of these bonds. 
Calculations of the dissociation energy of the Ti-C bond in TiCl3 CH3 by the un-
limited Hartree-Fock method [47] indicated two reasons for this instability. The 
first reason is the closeness of the energies for 3d, 4s, and 4p electronic levels in the Ti 
atom, and the second one is the low "diffusivity" (extension in space) of its 3d 
atomic orbitals. When the Ti-C bond formed by 3d, 4s, and 4p Ti orbitals and the 
hybrid C orbital starts to elongate in the transition state, either in the bond 
dissociation reaction or in the olefin insertion reaction, the elongation results in a 
rapid rearrangement of the Ti electron structure. Electrons of the singlet couple of 
the Ti-C bond start to separate in space. One of them localizes on the carbon hybrid 
orbital and the second one localizes on the Ti 3d orbital. This means that the Ti-C 
bond, while remaining in the ground state, acquires triplet characteristics, and the 
Ti atom becomes effectively reduced. Calculations showed that this triplet insta-
bility of the Ti-C bond results in a significant decrease of its energy in the transition 
state, thus explaining its kinetic instability in numerous reactions. In this respect, a 
transition metal-carbon bond differs substantially from a non-transition 
metal-carbon (e.g., AI-C) which elongates without spatial separation of electrons 
in its bonding orbital at distances typical for reaction transition states. 
The susceptibility of transition metal-carbon bonds to electron separation at low 
elongation depends to some degree on the environment around the bond [55]. In 
particular, electron donor ligands should enhance the lability of the bond. This 
suggestion has not been examined in detail yet. However, if true, it can explain well-
established effects of catalyst modifiers (both organic and inorganic), as well as of 
supports, on the activity of polymerization centers. 
One of a few well-documented olefin insertion reactions in model compounds, 
in which a coordination complex between a transition metal atom and an olefin 
was isolated and characterized, is ethylene insertion into a Nb-H bond [56]: 
(V-I 8) 
500-MHz lH-NMR study showed that the insertion process is a rapid mono-
molecular process (Kl(60Â°C) '" 5 sec-l) with activation parameters llHt = 15 
kcal/mol and I1St = -9 e.u. 
The similarity between this reaction and the second step in Reaction V -16 is not 
very strong. The Nb-ethylene complex is stable and the equilibrium in Reaction 

V -2: Intimate Mechanism of the Olefin Insertion Reaction 
389 
V-I8 is shifted to the left. On the other hand, kinetic data discussed in Section II-8 
indicate that the corresponding Ti-olefin complexes are very unstable (there are no 
reports on their isolation or characterization) and the insertion reaction of the 
coordinated olefin is virtually irreversible (the second step of Reaction V-I6). The 
reverse reaction for a polymerization center 
Cat-CH2-CHR-Polymer -> Cat-H + CH2=CR-Polymer 
is known for heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts (the spontaneous chain trans-
fer process, Reaction 1-7) but its incidence is very rare (see Table 1-3) whereas for 
Reaction V-I8 Ll > kl [56]. 
V -2-d. 
Participation of Organometallic Compounds in the Polymerization 
Center 
As was discussed in Sections II -4-e and II -4-d, organometallic compounds present 
in a polymerization system influence polymerization activity (possibly the propa-
gation rate constants of active centers) as well as the distribution of active center 
isospecificities (Section IV-I). This influence has been recognized for a long time 
and numerous attempts have been made to "incorporate" organometallic com-
pounds into the polymerization center structure. 
Participation of organoaluminum compounds in the polymerization centers of 
(CsHsh TiC12-AlR2 Cl soluble catalytic systems is now proved experimentally [11, 
12, l7-22]-see Figures V-I and V-2. However, in the absence of direct experi-
mental data for heterogeneous catalysts all attempts to visualize participation of 
organometallic compounds in polymerization centers remain speculative. It is 
usually suggested that organoaluminum compounds are complexed with the tran-
sition metal atom of a polymerization center through two bridge bonds with the 
participation of halogen atoms [48] 
Similar two-bridge structures were discovered experimentally on TiCl3 surfaces that 
were treated with AIMe3 vapor [57] (see Section II-2-a) but they were claimed to be 
catalytically inactive. 
Examination of the steric environment in the models of polymerization centers 
(like those presented in Figs. V -3 and V -4) with attached isotactic polymer chains in 
helical conformations [42] suggested that such bulky ligands as the doubly bridged 
organoaluminum compounds cannot be accommodated in the vicinity of a tran-
sition metal atom bearing a polymer chain and other halogen ligands. For this 
reason it was assumed [42] that organometallic compounds do not form complexes 
directly with the transition metal atoms in such centers but with other transition

In such complexes the influence of organometallic compounds on the reactivity of 
the transition metal atom connected to a polymer chain can be conveyed through 
the halogen bridges. As was discussed in the previous section, such complex ligands 
can exert significant influence on the lability of transition metal-carbon bonds and 
thus facilitate insertion reactions of coordinated olefin molecules. 
V-2-e. 
Cis-Insertion Reaction 
The way in which the double bond of an olefin molecule opens when it incorporates 
a polymer chain is an important clue to the mechanism of an olefin polymerization 
reaction. Significant efforts were made to study this problem for olefin polymeri-
zation with heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts. The principal idea of all such 
experiments was to obtain polymers of deuterium-substituted monomers and to 
study the relative positions of hydrogen and deuterium atoms in these polymers by 
IR or NMR methods. Deuterium-labeled polyethylenes and polypropylenes have 
been employed in these studies. Fig. V-6 shows the structures of the products 
obtained in polymerization of 1,2-d2-ethylenes by two possible mechanisms of 
double bond opening, trans and cis. To make the formation of these polymer chains 
more explicit two stages of the cis-opening process are presented: (a) double bond 
opening with the formation of a chain segment in the eclipsed conformation and (b) 
rotation of this segment with the formation of the final stable trans conformation. 
Electronic and steric differences between hydrogen and deuterium atoms are too 
insignificant to expect the formation of the regular sequences of units presented in 
Fig. V -6, e.g., erytho-diisotactic aaa or a' a' a' sequences from cis-l ,2-d2-ethylene or 
bbb or b' b' b' sequences from trans-l,2-dz-ethylene. Rather one has to expect the 
formation of "random copolymers," for example, the formation of an a-a'-
"copolymer" in the reaction of cis-opening of cis-I,2-d2-ethylene, a b-b'-
"copolymer" in the reaction of trans-opening of this monomer, etc. 
The infrared spectra of the polymerization products of cis- and trans-I,2-d2-
ethylene with the TiC14-AlEt3 system were observed [58] to be different in some 
spectral regions. The most characteristic in this respect are bands of poly(trans-l ,2-
d2-ethylene) at 1335, 1288, 594, and 586 cm -1 and those of poly( cis-l ,2-d2-ethylene) 
at 1306, 597, and 590 cm-1. Normal mode calculations for regularly built polymers 
(e.g., aaa, aa'aa', bbb, bb'bb', etc.) [58] as well as these for random "a-a'-
copolymers" and "b-b'-copolymers" [59] and their comparison with experimental 
spectra clearly showed that C-D bonds in poly(cis-I,2-d2-ethylene) are in a trans 
conformation and those in poly(trans-l,2-dz-ethylene) are in a cis conformation, 

V-2: Intimate Mechanism of the Olefin Insertion Reaction 
391 
Figure V -6. Stereochemistry of double bond opening for cis- and trans-l ,2-dz-ethylene (cis-
and trans-opening). 
i.e., cis-opening of double bonds takes place in these polymerization reactions (see 
Fig. V-6). 
A similar approach was used for isotactic polymers of deuterium-labeled propyl-
ene. It was shown that two isotactic polymers, those of trans-l-d-propylene and cis-
I-d-propylene, have different IR spectra [60, 61]. Two independent sets of calcul-
ations of their normal modes [62, 63] demonstrated that poly(cis-I-d-propylene) is 
an erythro-diisotactic polymer and poly (trans-I-d-propylene) is a threo-diisotactic 
polymer. This assignment is proof of the cis-opening of the propylene double 
bond-see Fig. V-7. 
It is necessary to mention that the planar zigzag conformations shown in Fig. V-7 
are purely imaginary ones. The real conformation of these sequences is TGTG, 
corresponding to the 31 helix of isotactic polypropylene. 
Another proof of the cis-opening of the double bond in isospecific propylene 
polymerization was obtained by the NMR method [64]. The 1 H-NMR spectrum of 
isotactic poly(cis-CHD=CH-CD 3) exhibits A2X2 symmetry with JAX = 7 cps. 
On the other hand, the spectrum of isotactic poly(trans-CHD=CH-CD 3) has 
A2B2 symmetry with JAB = 5.7 cps. A configurational statistical approach to the 
evaluation of comparative J AX and JAB values showed that in poly(cis-CHD= 
CH-CD 3) the hydrogen atom of the CHD groups is in the syn position with 
respect to the CD3 group and that in poly(trans-CHD=CH-CD3 ) it is in the anti 
position. This means that both these polymers were formed by cis-opening of 
the propylene double bonds. NMR spectra of poly(CHD=CH-CD3) and 
poly(CHD=CD-CD3 ) showed that cis-opening is also characteristic for syn-

diospecific propylene polymerization [64, 65] as well as for isotactic sequences in 
amorphous polypropylene fractions [65]. 
The fact that cis-opening of olefin double bonds occurs means that when an 
olefin is incorporated into a polymer chain, both "ends" of an "opened" double 
bond are aimed in the same direction (see Figs. V-6 and V-7), i.e., they remain 
bound during the movement along the reaction coordinate. These findings confirm 
the validity of the olefin insertion mechanism into the O'-metal-carbon bond as 
shown in the polymerization schemes discussed in the previous section (Figs. V-3, 
V-4, and V-5).

Molecular Orbital Calculations of the Propagation Step 
Molecular orbital calculations of the structure of active species and of reaction 
pathways are an important tool in the elucidation of many reactions including 
reactions with the participation of transition metals. Several papers dealing with 
such calculations for the olefin polymerization reaction with heterogeneous and 
homogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts have been published during the last twenty 
years. The calculation methods varied from simple semi-empirical MO calculations 
in earlier papers [66, 67] to the most updated, sophisticated ab initio method [48] 
and the Hartree-Fock-Slater energy band method [68]. This section discusses some 
representative computational results for polymerization centers and reaction 
pathways.

chemical aspects of this model were discussed in Section V -2-6 and the mechanism 
of the interaction of this center with an olefin molecule is shown in Fig. V-3. These 
calculations were preceded by a qualitative discussion of the interaction between 
such a center and an ethylene molecule [40]. The MO energy diagram of this 
complex is presented in Fig. V-8. 
Initially the center has the following MOs which participate in the interaction 
with an olefin molecule (in addition to stable 4s and 4p Ti orbitals and all bonding 
orbitals of the alkyl group): 
(i) A stable M 0 of the Ti -C bond (<PRM) occupied by two electrons. 
(ii) An empty antibonding MO of the Ti-C bond (<P~M)' 
(iii) Degenerate non bonding 3d orbitals of Ti. 
When an ethylene molecule is coordinated with the Ti atom, both of its n-
orbitals, the bonding (n) and antibonding (n*) orbitals, are split as a result of 
interaction with the 3d orbitals of the Ti atom. This splitting changes the energy 
levels as follows: 
(i) A new stable three-nuclear orbital, 1/11, is formed. It is occupied by the electron 
pair formerly belonging to the ethylene n MO. This MO is assumed to be very 
stable energetically. 
(ii) A new MO, 1/12, is formed from the 3dyz orbital of Ti and the n*-MO of 
ethylene. This MO contains one electron, formerly belonging to the Ti3+ atom. 
(iii) Two new empty antibonding MOs, 1/1 rand 1/1 I, are formed also. 
(iv) The remaining 3d orbitals of Ti (dxy and dxz) become slightly split. 
It was proposed [40] that the limiting factor of the olefin insertion reaction is a 
homolytic splitting of the Ti-C bond. The energy required is approximately equal to 

394 
V: Mechanism of Isospecific Olefin Polymerization 
the energy for the transfer of an electron from the stable CPRM level of the Ti-C bond 
of the nonbonding 3d level of the Ti atom. When the complex with olefin is formed, 
a new l/I2{dyz) level becomes available for this electron transfer, i.e., ethylene 
coordination to a polymerization center facilitates homolytic splitting of the Ti-C 
bond, which is followed by the concerted formation of C-C and Ti-C bond, i.e., by 
ethylene insertion into the Ti-C bond, as shown in Fig. V-3. Thus, this qualitative 
picture presents the olefin insertion reaction as a molecular rearrangement with a 
small involvement of polar factors. 
A more theoretical basis was provided for the scheme shown in Fig. V -7 when the 
MO calculations were carried out for this reaction [66, 67] with the application of 
the self-consistent semi-empirical method [69]. These calculations were performed 
for the Cl4 TiCH3 ... C2H 4 complex. They confirmed that the Ti-C bond in the 
initial complex (CPRM) which is formed by the 3dz2, 3d,z, 4s, and 4pTi orbitals and the 
2s, and 2p C orbitals is relatively stable. The gap between this MO and the lowest 
half-filled 3dTi orbital (AEvalue in Fig. V-8, an estimation ofthe case ofTi-C bond 
homolytic dissociation) is in the range of ~ 25 kcal/mol [67] to 42 kcal/mol [66]. 
Ethylene coordination decreases this gap: whereas the position of the Ti-CH3 MO 
remains virtually unchanged {according to Ref. [67] it decreases by 4 kcal/mol)6 the 
energy of the half-occupied MO formed by the Ti 3dyz orbital and the ethylene n*-
MO is decreased significantly (to ~ 13.6 kcal/mol according to Ref. [67]), thus 
reducing the gap to !J.E' ~ 15 [67]-31 [66] kcal/mo1.7 
Data on atomic charges and bond orders in the initial catalytic center, in its 
complex with ethylene and along the reaction pathway of ethylene insertion into the 
Ti-CH3 bond according to Fig. V-3, showed that the Ti-CH3 bond is moderately 
polar: the electron charge on the CH3 groups is -0.37 [66]. However, coordination 
of ethylene at the catalytic center and the beginning of its insertion are not accom-
panied by any noticeable polarization of the Ti-CH3 bond. This means that the 
CH3 group does not leave its position in the center as an anion, as is implied by the 
term "coordination anionic mechanism" frequently applied to olefin polymeriza-
tions with Ziegler-Natta catalysts.

Hexa- vs. Pentacoordinated Centers: Calculations by CNDO

Additional information on the possible mechanism of olefin insertion into the 
transition metal-carbon bond was presented in Ref. [45] where MO calculations of 
the possible structures of polymerization centers were carried out with the applica-
tion of the modified CNDO method. These calculations included the participation 
of Ti 3d orbitals. 
Two model structures of polymerization centers were discussed in Ref. [45], those

with hex a- and pentacoordinated Ti atoms as presented in Figs. V-3 and V-5. 
Ethylene coordination results in the degeneration of these two structures into a 
single hexacoordinated complex (see Fig. V-9) which is further transformed in the 
course of the olefin insertion. 
These calculations unambigously demonstrated that the pentacoordinated struc-
ture (B in Fig. V-9) is more favorable energetically. When an ethylene molecule 
approaches such a center for coordination the energy of the system B must first be 
raised since the methyl group must be shifted, creating a transient vacant site, in 
order for coordination to take place. However the energy released in the course of 
ethylene coordination lowers the energy of the system as a whole and this more 
than compensates for the reorganization at the Ti atom. 
The highest occupied orbital in the coordination complex C in Fig. V-9, accord-
ing to Ref. [45], is the Ti-CH3 bonding MO which is built largely from Ti 3d orbitals 
(mostly 3dz2) and the 2s-2p hybrid C orbital. The interaction with an ethylene 
molecule involves 3dx 2_ y 2 and 3dz2 Ti orbitals, which make a (J bond with the 
ethylene n-orbital, and the 3dyz Ti orbital, which interacts with the ethylene n*-MO 
much in the same way as was proposed in Refs. [40] and [66]. However, this n-
component of the ethylene bonding is very weak and it results in only a marginal 
decrease of the Ti 3dvz level: ca. 2 kcaljmol, i.e, much less than predicted in Fig. V-S. 
Consequently, the gap between the highest filled and the lowest unfilled orbitals 
remains too high (ca. ISO kcaljmol) to be of any importance for the ethylene 
insertion process. Moreover, ethylene coordination apparently stabilizes the 
Ti-CH3 bond. 
When calculations were made for the internal transformation in complex C (Fig. 
V-9) resulting in ethylene insertion into the Ti-CH3 bond and the formation of the 
Ti-C3H7 bond [45], an important finding emerged which was overlooked in previ-
ous calculations-the occurrence of a principal change of the orbital bonding in the 
course of ethylene insertion. As soon as the methyl group in complex B (Fig. V-9) 
begins to move from its initial position to the pseudo-octahedral position character-

istic of complex C, the new symmetry induces bonding (previously forbidden) 
between the methyl carbon atom and the dyz orbital of the Ti atom. Since this Ti 
orbital is already weakly overlapping with the ethylene n*-MO its involvement in 
the bonding of the methyl group brings about a threefold result: it activates the 
Ti-C bond (its energy rises), links it with ethylene, and helps to populate the n*-
MO. This 3dyz involvement is increased to the point where one of its lobes overlaps 
the CH3 orbital and the second one overlaps one of the ethylene carbon atoms-see 
Fig. V-lO. 
Thus, the Ti 3dyz orbital acts as a "transfer agent," allowing the methyl group to 
leave its position near the Ti atom and to attach itself to the carbon atom of the 
coordinated ethylene molecule. This role of the 3dyz orbital fades away after the 
transition state and the new bond between the Ti atom and the ethylene carbon 
atom is formed mostly with the participation of the Ti 3dz 2 orbital. 
The initiation of the electron redistribution reaction (constituting insertion) is 
believed to be at least partially due to a specific charge distribution in complex C 
(Fig. V-9). The methyl group of this complex carries substantial negative charge 
whereas ethylene carbon atoms are slightly positive. This predisposes these atoms 
toward strong interaction and migration proceeds with virtually no activation 
barrier [45]. 
The role of aluminum-containing ligands in complex B (or A) is seen mostly as a 
means for providing a high coordination number for the Ti atom (which is assured 
in real solid catalysts by lattice structure-see Fig. II-I). However, no significant 
electronic contribution of this group to the Ti-CH3 or Ti-ethylene bonds was 
found [45].

A h initio Calculations of the Pentacoordinated Center 
Very detailed calculation of another quasi-trigonal bipyramidal polymerization 
center and of its interaction with olefin molecules were performed by the most 
advanced and theoretically sound quantum mechanical method, the ab initio [48] 
method, which takes into account almost all of the electrons in a system rather than 
just the valence electrons as in the case in all semi-empirical methods.

direction of approach of the ethylene molecule to the center are presented in Fig. 
V-II. It is similar in many details to the center shown in Figs. V-S and V-9 (complex 
B). The center contains a pentacoordinated Ti atom, two chlorine atoms along the 
z axis bound solely to the Ti atom, two chlorine atoms in the xy-plane making 
bridges with the AI(CH3h group, and one methyl group attached to the Ti atom 
and lying in the xy-plane with the Ti-CH3 bond making 45Â° angles with the x- and 
y-axes. If one separates AI(CH3hCI as a constituent unit in this center, the remain-
ing entity has the composition TiCl3 CH3 with the formal valence state of the Ti 
atom being equal to 4. 
The ethylene molecule approaches the center with its C=C bond parallel to the 
Ti-CH3 bond (the same way as in Figs. V-3, V-4and V-S) and coordinates on theTi 
atom, changing its configuration from trigonal bipyramidal to pseudo-octahedral 
due to the rotation of the CH3 group in the direction of the x- axis. 
Figure V-12 shows the change of the total energy of the system as a function of 
the distance between the ethylene molecule and the Ti atom which for steps l-S 
shown in the figure is correspondingly 7.0, S.O, 4.0, 3.0, and 2.S A. The initial 
shallow minimum in Fig. V -12 corresponds to ethylene coordination. It is followed 
by an activation barrier of ca. IS kcal/mol, coinciding with double bond opening, 
and by a final noticeable stabilization of the system. 
Table V -2 contains data on the interatomic distances and electronic charges on 
some of the atoms in the system in Fig. V-II during ethylene approach to the center 
and its insertion into the Ti-CH3 bond. 
What emerges from the information in Fig. V-12 and Table V-2 is a concerted 
process involving two bonds, Ti-CH3 and C=C, and the angle the Ti-CH3 bond 
makes with the coordinate axes; a process similar to that described in Ref. [4S] and 
discussed in the previous Section. In steps 1-4 (Table V-2) the ethylene molecule 
approaches the Ti atom without undergoing any substantial change. The C=C 
distance increases slightly and additional small negative charges develop on its

carbon atoms. However, in the course of this approach the Ti-CH3 bond rotates in 
the xy plane around the Ti atom (aR decreases) providing a coordination site for the 
ethylene molecule. Steps 4 and 5 represent the ethylene coordination stage. The 
coordination does not influence the Ti-CH3 bond much; its length remains the 
same (2.15 A) as well as the polarity. 
Steps 6 and 7 represent the passage of the system over the activation barrier (see 
Fig. V-12) which is associated with the breaking of two bonds, Ti-C and C=C. The 
low height of this barrier (15 kcal/mol) is mainly due to the fact that (a) ethylene is 
already inside the catalyst coordination sphere and (b) new Ti-C(4) and C(3)-C(5) 
bonds begin to build up as the double bond breaks. 
Finally, the new Ti-CH2 bond is formed with the same length as the initial 
Ti-CH3 bond and the initial C(4)-C(5) double bond becomes a single bond with a 
length of 1.54 A. 
Energy calculations in Ref. [48] demonstrated that the highest occupied MO in 
the initial complex in Fig. V-II is localized on the Ti-CH3 bond, as was predicted in 
Ref. [40]. When an ethylene molecule is absent, the lowest unoccupied MO is the 
antibonding Ti-CH3 orbital (designated as CP:M in Fig. V-8), rather than the Ti 3d 
orbital as was proposed in Ref. [40]. When an ethylene molecule approaches the Ti 
atom, the lowest unoccupied MO mixes strongly with the ethylene anti bonding n*-
MO. This results in a drastic decrease of the orbital energy (more than 120 
kcal/mol). This mixing indicates that ethylene coordination occurs through strong 
overlap of the Ti 3dxy orbital and the C Py orbitals of the ethylene molecule. 
However, the gap between the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied MO is 
still too high (ca. 190 kcal/mol) to regard the electron transition between them as the 
initial step of Ti-C bond breaking, as was suggested in Ref. [40]. 
Indeed, ab initio calculations ruled out any CH3 radical liberation in this reaction 
with ethylene and showed that the Ti-CH3 bond breaking is accompanied by 
Ti-C(4) and CH3-C(5) bond formation. However, the Ti-C bond was found to be 
highly labile, permitting the methyl group to behave as a "trapped radical" capable

of reacting readily with ethylene without being expelled from the coordination 
sphere [48]. 
The authors of Ref. [48] suggested also that if another Ti atom is considered as a 
ligand to the Ti atom bearing the methyl group in the center, its main effect will be to 
donate electrons toward the active site, which would facilitate both methyl mi-
gration and n-bond breaking. 
It should be noted with regard to the results described in this section that ab initio 
calculations showed no electronic activation barrier for ethylene coordination to 
the Ti atom but found a substantial barrier for its insertion (Fig. V -12). This implies 
that from the kinetic point of view (see Section 11-8) the following relations hold in 
Eqn. II-47: 
k" > k'" and k'Cm > k'" 
and that the equilibrium constant K in the Michaelis-Menten equation II-51 
becomes equal to k" /k', the equilibrium constant of ethylene coordination. 
Judging from experimental data on the order of the polymerization reaction with 
respect to monomer concentration (which is first order in the majority of cases-see 
Sections I-I and 1-2) the K value in Eqn. II-51 should be high (for example, much 
higher than 10 mol/liter-the maximum attainable monomer concentration), i.e., 
dissociation of the ethylene complex in Reaction II-47 (or in Figs. V-3-V-5) should 
be much less facile than ethylene coordination. This assumption contradicts the 
above-mentioned conclusion of the ab initio calculations (taken literally) which 
predict !!Et ~ 0 for ethylene coordination vs. !!Et ~ 5 kcal/mol for ethylene 
dissociation. 
However, the possibility exists that the olefin approach to a polymerization 
center, however facile from the electronic point of view, involves some steric barrier 
due to repulsive interaction between the olefin and the polymer molecule attached 
to the center. If this molecule is represented by a methyl group (as in Fig. V-II) no 
such repulsion is envisioned. However, it can become substantial if the Ti atom in 
Fig. V-ll bears a polymer molecule of a complex spatial configuration. This 
problem is discussed in more detail in Section V-4.

Molecular Orbital Calculations of a Center in a Crystal Lattice 
All MO calculations discussed previously dealt only with the "cluster" structure of a 
polymerization center containing one transition metal atom. They ignored com-
pletely the fact that these polymerization centers are situated on a catalyst surface 
and are imbedded in a crystal lattice with many neighboring transition metal atoms, 
as shown in Figs. II-I and 11-2. This shortcoming was mended in Ref. [68] where a 
real TiCl3 lattice containing polymerization centers was examined. The catalyst 
surface was modeled by a crystal which is infinite in two directions (corresponding 
to the elementary lattice motif of TiCl3 as shown in Fig. II-I) and is thin in the 
thickness direction, embracing only one "sheet" of the TiCl3 crystal lattice. This 
"sheet" represents a sandwich structure with two chlorine layers surrounding a

crystal. There are two bands in the spectrum- one consisting of predominantly CI

orbitals which is only partially filled (ca. 10%). Such partially filled levels are typical 
for metals.

group 45Â° to the crystal surface, one state is removed from the Cl 3p band and a new 
Ti-R band appears between the Cl and Ti bands (see Fig. V-14(B)). This band is a 
crystalline analogue of the highest filled orbital in the "cluster" models described 
above (e.g., see Fig. V-8), whereas the partially filled Ti 3d band is a crystalline 
analogue of the lowest empty orbital. 
According to the calculations [68] the covalent Ti-C bond is a polar one: ca. 0.79 
e on the C 2p nonbonding orbital of CH3. Similar results for the position and 
features of the Ti - R bond were obtained when the Ti -CH3 bond was substituted by 
the Ti-C2Hs bond. 
Coordination of the center with an ethylene molecule gives rise to three new MOs 
shown in Fig. V-14(B). 
(i) n-Ti-the o--bond between the Ti 3d orbital and the ethylene n-orbital (equiva-
lent of the 1/11 orbital in Fig. V-8). 
(ii) Ti-n*-the n-bonding combination of the Ti 3d and the ethylene n-orbital 
(the 1/12 orbital in Fig. V-8). 
(iii) n*-Ti-the unoccupied antibonding n*-orbital in the ethylene complex (the 
I/I! orbital in Fig. V -8). 
The coordination of ethylene causes only a slight change in the Ti-CH3 band. 
These principal results are in agreement with the previously discussed findings 
for "cluster" models. The calculations showed also that a coordinated ethylene 
molecule has a small positive charge (ca. +0.04 e). The same conclusion was 
reached in Ref. [45], whereas other calculations assign a negative charge to ethylene. 
The main features of ethylene insertion into the Ti-CH3 bond as estimated in 
Ref. [68] broadly coincide with the results obtained by the ab initio method [48]. The 
only principal difference is the substantial occupancy of the Ti-n* band (n*-C=C 
MO, up to 0.14) during the insertion transition step, indicating a significant back-
donation. This effect remained unnoticed in Ref. [48] because the Ti valence state 
was assumed to be +4 rather than +3 as in Ref. [68]. 
These calculations demonstrated also that no significant change in the band 
positions shown in Fig. V -14(B) occurs if an AIC13 molecule is introduced into the 
elementary catalyst cell to model TiCl3 . Ij3AICl3-based catalysts. Equally unim-
portant from the electronic point of view is the alternation of TiCl3 and MgCl2 
elementary sheets, modeling highly active supported catalysts utilizing MgCI2.

Mechanism of Acetylene Polymerization 
As was discussed in Section 11-5-f, acetylene is a specific poison for heterogeneous 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts under conditions typical for olefin polymerization. It blocks or very 
strongly decelerates polymerization of ot-olefins but slowly polymerizes by itself. When 
mixtures of acetylene and olefins are admitted to such catalysts, colored copolymers are 
formed containing relatively long sequences of trans-double bonds. A detailed study of 
acetylene polymerization with the soluble Ti(OBu)cAlEt3 system at various temperatures 
showed [71] that at low temeperature polyacetylene has a predominantly cis structure 
(indicating the cis-opening of its triple bond). With increase in temperature the cis-trans

isomerization of poly acetylene becomes noticeable and at 20Â°C this isomerization reaches ca. 
50%. A similar structure of the polymer was found in the case of acetylene polymerization 
with the TiClcAli-Bu3 system at 23Â°C [72]. 
The poisoning effect of acetylene in olefin polymerization can be explained in two ways: 
(i) Acetylene forms much more stable complexes with transition metal compounds than 
olefins do and occupies most of the available vacancies, thus preventing olefins from 
coordination. One of the reasons for the increased stability of acetylene complexes with 
transition metals can be an additional interaction (in addition to the interaction typical 
for olefins and described in the previous sections-see Fig. V-3)-that between the 
second n-bonding orbital of an acetylene molecule and one of the metal d orbitals with 
appropriate symmetry (e.g., the Ti 3dxz orbital). 
(ii) After acetylene insertion into the transition metal-carbon bond a new chemical bond is 
formed 
M-CH=CH-Polymer 
The last carbon atom in this bond can be bound to the transition metal atom more 
strongly than in a standard M-CH2 bond due to an additional interaction between the 
n*-antibonding orbital of the double bond and the 3d orbital of the transition metal 
atom:

This additional bond increases the activation barrier for olefin insertion but it is not high 
enough to prevent further acetylene insertion, however slow, thus favoring the formation 
of conjugated polyacetylene blocks.

Mechanism of Isospecific Chain Growth 
Formation of isotactic polyolefins is a unique feature of heterogeneous 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts. Whereas isotactic polypropylene can be produced with 
some chromium oxide catalysts and isotactic polystyrene with Alfin catalysts, only 
heterogeneous catalysts containing transition metal halides provide a versatile tool 
for the formation of isotactic polymers from virtually all alpha olefins with vinyl 
double bonds. 8 
8 There were two reports describing the synthesis of isotactic polyolefins with soluble Ziegler-Natta 
catalysts. In one of them, mildly isotactic polypropylene and poly-4-methyl-l-pentene were obtained 
with zirconium benzyl derivatives [73]. A wide molecular weight distribution of these polymers was 
regarded as indicative of their formation on solid colloidal catalyst particles [74]. In another case mildly 
isotacticpolypropylene (ki,o/ksyndio = 6-10) was obtained with the solubleTi(acach CI2-AIEt2CI system 
[75]. It ws suggested that polynuclear clusters containing 5-20 Ti atoms are responsible for the catalytic 
activity [75]. More thorough study of these polymerizations is necessary before isospecific olefin 
polymerization with soluble catalysts can be regarded as definitively proven. 

404 
V: Mechanism ofIsospecific Olefin Polymerization 
As was discussed in Section 111-3, the structure of steric errors in isotactic 
polyolefins suggests that these chains are formed by an enantiomorphous 
mechanism-the mechanism according to which chain stereoregularity is deter-
mined by the steric control of an enantiomorphous polymerization center rather 
than by the steric interaction between a growing polymer chain and an approaching 
monomer molecule. 
The enantiomorphous polymerization mechanism in these reactions is univer-
sally acknowledged nowadays. However, particulars of the structure ofpolymeriza-
tion centers and the intimate mechanism of stereo regulation remain much debated 
subjects. 
A priori, several different features of a polymerization center (with the chemical 
structure discussed in previous sections of this chapter) can account for its stereoreg-
ulative ability: 
(i) an asymmetry in the arrangement of ligands around a transition metal atom, 
for example, the arrangement of halogen atoms. Such asymmetry can exist 
before the beginning of a polymerization reaction, i.e., it can be an intrinsic 
feature of the crystal of a transition metal halide, or it can appear in the process 
of the interaction between the transition metal halide and an organometallic 
compound. 
(ii) the asymmetry can appear due to a specific orientation of a polymer chain end 
at the center and will result in the formation of an asymmetric coordination 
space for an olefin molecule. Such asymmetry does not exist in the center 
initially but appears after the first few polymerization steps. 
(iii) the asymmetry can be a result of the asymmetry of a growing polymer mole-
cule. Under conditions typical for the polymerization reaction most polyolefin 
molecules exist in a helical form. The asymmetry of such a helix in the vicinity 
of a polymerization center can by itself be a reason for the continuous growth 
of an isotactic chain (and continuation of the helix structure). 
These three possibilities were discussed in numerous articles. Whereas no concensus 
exists about the relative importance of these possible asymmetric effects, significant 
experimental evidence accumulated in the literature allows one to examine this 
problem in much detail. 
The next section discusses experimental evidence supporting these ideas. Parti-
cular mechanisms of isospecific polyolefin growth are examined in Section V-4-b. 
V -4-a. 
Experimental Data on Isospecific Chain Propagation 
The first possible source of asymmetry of a polymerization center can be asymmetry 
in the arrangement ofligands around its transition metal atom. The analysis of the 
structure of transition metal halides provides some clues about the nature of this 
asymmetry. 
The first type of such asymmetry was discussed in Ref. [40]. If one looks at the 
basal plane of a MCl3 crystal with the structure discussed in Section II-I (a front 
view of such a lattice is presented in Fig. II-I and a side view is shown in Fig. 11-2)

and examines a transition metal atom with its closest neighbors (six halogen atoms) 
and its second closest neighbors (three other transition metal atoms), the resulting 
structure shown in Fig. V-IS has a symmetry described by the D3 point group and 
possesing a threefold chirality. This chirality is typical for all transition metal 
halides used as catalysts for olefin polymerization. It is easy to see that the optical 
configuration of the central atom is opposite from those of the other three metal 
atoms in Fig. V-IS. Elementary symmetry considerations show that all metal atoms 
in such crystals can be divided into two groups with opposite configurations 
(chirality). Following the IUPAC nomenclature [76], they are designated as ~ and A 
centers. 
However, when transition metal halides interact with organometallic com-
pounds, the sequence of substitution and complexation reactions described in 
Section II-4 results in the removal of virtually all surface halogen atoms (those 
protruding above the plane of the four metal atoms in Fig. V-IS). This transforma-
tion reduces the intrinsic asymmetry of the metal atoms but does not eliminate it 
completely. Some consequences of this asymmetry for polymerization mechanisms 
are discussed in Section V-4-b. 
Another type of intrinsic lattice asymmetry characteristic for crystals of tran-
sition metal halides was discussed in Ref. [77]. The coordination number of metal 
atoms in such lattices is 6. However, when lateral faces of such crystals are examined 
(see, for example, Fig. II-2) it is immediately apparent that this coordination 
number cannot hold for the transition metal atoms on these surfaces. This means 
that these atoms should have vacancies. Careful analysis of the possible structures 
of these vacancies demonstrated that the typical arrangement on the lateral MX3 
surfaces includes [77] (see Fig. V-16): 
(i) an exposed metal atom with one vacancy, 
(ii) four exposed halogen atoms (in addition to one unexposed halogen atom 
bounded to the metal atom which cannot be seen in Fig. V-I6).

Two of the atoms are submerged and form bridges with other metal atoms (halogen 
atoms B). Two other atoms (Fand L) protrude from the crystal. One of them is also 
a bridge atom (F) whereas another one (L) is bound to one metal atom only. This 
loosely bound halogen atom is an obvious candidate for exchange with the alkyl 
group of an organometallic compound. After such an exchange the exposed metal 
atom in Fig. V-16 remains asymmetric because one of the bridged halogen atoms 
protrudes and two other are submerged. This type of asymmetry was also regarded 
as the source of the stereoregulative power of polymerization centers.

were obtained in the analysis of 13C-NMR spectra of various polypropylene sam-
ples obtained with 13C-Iabelled catalysts and of the spectra of 13C-enriched 
polymers. 
These findings were based on the previous discovery of distereotopicity in 2,4,6-
trimethylheptane [78]. This compound has no asymmetric carbon atoms and is not 
diastereomeric 
(V-20) 
However, when its 13C-NMR spectra were examined it was discovered that the CH3 
signal of the isopropyl group in Compound V-20 is split into a doublet with !J..~ 
'" 0.8 ppm, i.e., these methyl groups are not completely equivalent sterically (or 
they are diastereotopic). This splitting arises, according to Ref. [78], from their 
different steric relationships with the central methyl group. This molecule can be 
represented in a Fisher projection as a short segment of the isotactic polypropylene 
chain

The peak assignment in the 13C-NMR spectrum of Compound V-20 was per-
formed by selective deuteration of one of its end methyl groups [79]. The assignment 
is presented in Table V-3. The ratio of the areas of the two peaks of the methyl 
groups is I: 1. The same effect was found in the 13C-NMR spectrum of 2,4,6-
trimethyloctane [79] (Table V-3). This compound exists as a mixture of two diaste-
reomers, (4R), (6R) and (4R), (6S). Not only are the methyl signals ofthe isopropyl 
groups in these compounds split (the same way as in the spectrum of2,4,6-trimethyl-
heptane) but peak positions for these two stereoisomers are also different indicating 
that the methyl carbon atoms in the isopropyl groups are sensitive to the steric 
arrangement of both the closest structural unit and the next one. The same effects 
were found in the 13C-NMR spectra of 2,4,6-trimethylnonane [79]. The final 
assignment of the 13C_ NMR peaks of all four possible structures for polypropylene 
chain ends is presented in Table V-4 (from Ref. [80]).

V: Mechanism of Isospecific Olefin Polymerization 
isopropyl groups are arranged to make pseudo-isotactic or syndiotactic connections 
with the preceding methyl groups. The following definitions are given [79]: C2m and 
C6m methyl groups in 2,4,6-trimethylheptane and the C2m methyl group in 2,4,6,tri-
methyl octane are named erythro-methyl groups (equivalent to the isotactic connec-
tion with the previous group, as in Structure V-21) and Clm and C7m methyl groups 
in 2,4,6-trimethylheptane and the Clm methyl group in 2,4,6-trimethyloctane are 
named threo-methyl groups (equivalent to the syndiotactic connection, as in Struc-
ture V-22). 
The assignment of 13C-NMR peaks for the chain end-groups was used for the 
study of different propylene and I-butene polymers containing 13C labels. A 
summary of these studies is presented in Table V-So 
The following principal conclusions follow from these data: 
(i) When b-TiC13-based catalytic systems are used with such co-catalysts as 
(AlMe3 + ZnMe2)9 or AlMe2Cl, the [threo] : [erythro] ratios for polypropyl-
ene and poly-I-butene are close to 1 : 1, i.e., catalytic centers containing the 
Ti~CH3 bond (formed in the interaction between TiC13 and MRx) are not 
stereospecific. 
(ii) If the original alkyl group is ethyl (b-TiC13~AlEt3~ZnEt2) the centers become 
slightly stereospecific with the [iso/syndio] ratio ~4: 1. 
(iii) However, if iodine is present in a polymerization center (in the b-
TiC13~AlMe21 or TiI3-AlMe3 [92] systems), even centers with the Ti~CH3 
bond are slightly isospecific: the [iso/syndio] ratio is ~ 3 : I. 
(iv) The second propylene insertion into the Ti~CH3 bond can be regarded as the 
first insertion into the Ti~CH2~CH(CH3h bond. Judging by the [iso/syndio] 
ratioslO presented in Table V-S this second propylene insertion is highly 
stereospecific with a ratio higher than 10: 1. It should be remembered that 
the average [iso/syndio] ratio in polypropylene estimated by the l3C-NMR 
method for the b-TiC13-AlR3 (or AlR2Cl) system is of the order of 40~SO and 
that for the b-TiC13~AlR2I systems is ca. ISO (see Tables III-S and III-S). 
However, the low intensity of the end-group peaks in the 13C-NMR spectra in 
Refs. [2S], [SO], and [SI] does not allow more detailed speculation on the 
possible improvement of the stereospecificities of these catalysts by lengthen-
ing the alkyl group attached to them. 
(v) The presence of a chiral carbon atom in the vicinity of a transition metal atom 
(in the Ti-CH2-CH(C2Hs)CH3 bond formed after I-butene insertion into 
a Ti-CH3 bond) does not result in the formation of an isospecific center. 
(vi) Propylene insertion into the Ti-Ph bond is highly stereoselective [91]. 
Thus, the stereospecificity of a polymerization center depends to a significant 
9The principal role of ZnMe2 is to decrease the molecular weight of the polymer (see Section I-2-a, 
Reaction 1-6) and thus to increase the concentration of the end-groups in these samples. 
lOIn the case of Al(,3CH 3h-containing catalysts this ratio is represented by the [iso(iso)/iso(syndio)] 
and [syndio(iso)/syndio(syndio)] ratios and in the case of (13CH 3)-propylene it is represented by the 
[iso(iso)/iso(syndio)] ratio-see Table V-5.

C In this polymer both chain ends have 13CH3 groups but "the last" unit in the chain obtained with the highly isospecific catalyst should have predominantly iso(iso) 
structure which leaves an [iso(iso )/syndio(syndio)] ratio for the "beginning" of the chain of the order of 15 : I. The presence of an atactic material in this polymer

This sequence is attributed [80] to the creation of an asymmetric environment for 
olefin molecules approaching a transition metal atom for coordination. This pro-
cess is discussed in more detail in the next section. 
Another factor contributing to our understanding of the mechanism ofisospeci-
fic polymerization with heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts is the data on the 
polymerization of olefins containing asymmetric carbon atoms in their alkyl groups 
(Section 111-10). These studies demonstrated that these catalysts, in addition to 
being stereospecific, are also stereoselective. If the racemic mixture of two optically 
active olefins, CH2=CH-R* and CH2=CH-S*, is admitted to such catalysts 
and if the asymmetric carbon atom is close enough to their double bonds the 
catalysts can separate these olefins: some centers polymerize preferentially CH2= 
CH-R* and others act preferentially on CH2=CH-S* molecules. As a result, a 
racemic polymer mixture is formed. However, it can be separated into two optically 
active polymers by a co-crystallization technique (see Section 111-10). Quantitative 
measurements indicate that the degree of olefin selection in such polymerizations 
can be quite high (Table 111-25) and can be comparable to the degree of catalyst 
stereospecifici ty. 
As in the case of stereospecificity, the selection does not depend in the structure 
of the last unit in a growing polymer chain (it can be a unit with the same 
asymmetric carbon atom, a unit with an atom of opposite chirality, or an ethylene 
unit) but it depends on the properties ofthe polymerization center itself. Apparently 
two types of active centers are present on the catalyst surface in equal amounts, 
one preferring CH2=CH - R* molecules and the other preferring CH2=CH -S* 
molecules. The mechanism of such selection hardly can be correlated merely with 
the size of an alkyl group attached to a transition metal atom in the active center; 
it apparently relates to some inherent asymmetry of the transition atom environ-
ment (see discussion earlier in this section) which is important for olefin selection 
but does not influence center stereospecificity, as follows from Table V-5. 
It is quite possible that these two effects, stereoselectivity and stereospecificity, 
represent two manifestations of the same intrinsic chirality of polymerization 
centers which reveals itself through the intermediacy of the alkyl group attached 
to the center [80]. This alkyl group, if larger than methyl, provides an asymmetric 
site for olefin coordination and thus ensures repetitive stereospecific olefin addition 
to a growing chain. 
The role of a helical polyolefin molecule already attached to a polymerization 

V-4: Mechanism of Isospecific Chain Growth 
413 
center in the isotactic addition of other olefin molecules to this chain is difficult to 
elucidate. Evidently, this role can be envisaged as an additional influence on center 
stereospecificity apart from the inherent specificity described above and as a prob-
able enhancement of this specificity. 
Some clue as to the possible existence of this effect emerges if one compares the 
kiso/ksyndio ratios for various M-R groups presented above. Apparently they are 
higher when an isotactic polymer chain rather than a short alkyl group is attached 
to a polymerization center. 
Another indirect argument in favor of some helix influence on the catalyst 
performance comes from the study of olefin copolymerization [82]. The examina-
tion of '1'2 products for numerous olefin pairs collected in Ref. [82] shows a large 
number of cases where these products are substantially higher than 1 (usually ca. 
3-5). Statistical explanation of this phenomenon is discussed in Section III-4-b. 
The relation '1'2> 1 meanS that these copolymers contain homomonomer blocks 
in their chains oflonger length than the block length for a purely random monomer 
distribution. This can be envisaged as a situation where a given sequence of 
mOnomer units with a specific helical conformation has an increased tendency to 
perpetuate itself, "choosing" preferentially the same monomer molecules. Such a 
tendency is especially pronounced when the comOnomers have alkyl groups 
of different size (ethylene-4-methyl-l-pentene, propylene-styrene, propylene-
vinylcyclohexane pairs). On the other hand, when alkyl groups of the comonomers 
are of similar bulkiness (4-methyl-l-pentene-vinylcyclohexane, 4-methyl-l-
pentene-3-methyl-l-butene, vinylcyclohexane-styrene) the copolymers formed are 
random or have a tendency toward mOnomer alternation. 
Of course, this effect is not overwhelming in magnitude but its existence was 
noticed many times. Some explanations of this effect can be found in Refs. [83]-[85]. 
According to these references the reaSOn for such monomer selection is an enhanced 
steric repulsion between a part of the polymer helix attached to a transition metal 
atom and an "alien" monomer molecule coordinated at this metal atom compared 
with the situation when this coordinated molecule has the same or a sterically 
similar alkyl group as those in the polymer helix. 
To sum up these experimental findings on the origin of stereospecificity of 
heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts, the main source of their stereospecific 
behavior is an asymmetry of their polymerization centers. This asymmetry origi-
nates from the intrinsic asymmetry of the transition atom environment and, accord-
ing to the 13C-NMR data, is in particular due to the asymmetry of olefin coordi-
nation to a transition metal atom bearing a sufficiently long alkyl group. Some 
additional contribution to the center stereospecificity can also be expected to come 
from the part of a helical polymer molecule attached to the center. 
V -4-b. 
Proposed Models of Isospecific Polymerization Centers 
Several possible models of polymerization centers and specific features of their 
functioning which determine their isospecific action have been discussed in the 
literature. These models differ mainly in the description of the particular intrinsic

asymmetry they assume and in the influence of an alkyl group (a polymer chain) on 
the center stereospecificity. 
The first of the models [43] is based on the chemical mechanism [38~40] presented 
in Fig. V-3. Electronic features of this center are discussed in Section V-3-a. This 
polymerization center has a transition metal atom in an octahedral environment 
with four halogen ligands, one alkyl group, and one vacancy available for olefin 
coordination. The coordination occurs with the olefin double bond parallel to the 
M~C bond (Fig. V-3) and results in olefin insertion into this bond with the 
subsequent migration of the polymer chain back to its former coordination position 
and the restoration of the original vacancy. 
According to Ref. [43], these polymerization centers are situated on lateral faces 
of the crystals of transition metal halides, the areas where chlorine vacancies exist in 
the original crystals (before their interaction with organometallic compounds). The 
precursors of such polymerization centers are shown in Fig. V -16. The existence of 
the vacancy is seen clearly. After the alkylation reaction described in Section 11-2, 
one of the chlorine atoms (that loosely bound to the transition metal atom and 
marked L in Fig. V-16) is removed and an alkyl group is positioned in its place. 
The active center formed in this reaction consists of a square base having three 
chlorine atoms (B~B~F.in Fig. V-16) and an alkyl group (positioned at L in this 
figure) at its corners and a titanium atom in the middle. This square is anchored 
to the lateral face by the fourth chlorine atom (invisible in Fig. V-16, behind the 
transition metal atom). 
Figure V-17 shows the same center as in Fig. V -16 but with a propylene molecule 
coordinated to it. It can be seen from the figure that the plane perpendicular to the 
square base (Cl~Cl~Cl~R) and going through the Ti~C bond is not a plane of 
symmetry, because the exposed and blocked chlorine atoms differ in their surround-
ings. As a result, the two orientations for the propylene molecule that would lead 
to "head-to-tail" addition are not equivalent. In one of them the methyl group of 
the propylene molecule would cover the blocked chlorine atom for the greater part, 
which is sterically unfavorable. In the other orientation (shown in Fig. V-17) the 
methyl group will protrude out of the crystal. Consequently this will be the preferred 
orientation. It will result in a uniform (and hence isotactic) monomer addition to 
the chain [43]. 
The criticism of this polymerization mechanism concerns several of its features. 
First, this mechanism relies solely on the asymmetry of the chlorine atom arrange-

V-4: Mechanism of Isospecific Chain Growth 
415 
ment around the transition metal atom and should be effective independent of the 
type of alkyl group attached to the transition metal. However, experimental 13C_ 
NMR data discussed in the previous section show that this is not true and that an 
alkyl group of a significant size is required for the center to be really isospecific. 
Second, this mechanism assumes alkyl group migration as the last step of a mono-
mer addition reaction (Fig. V-3), a reaction which is poorly understood and which 
should require a substantial activation energy [41]. This step can be avoided in 
principle if the stable coordination around the transition metal atom in the center 
is trigonal bipyramidal rather than octahedral [45, 48]. However, a trigonal 
bipyramidal configuration of the center will result in a substantial shielding of the 
transition metal atom from olefin coordination. 
Further criticism of the center scheme shown in Figs. V -16 and V -17 concerns

the steric features of the center. Figure V-I8(A) shows the same center as in Figs. 
V-16 and V-I7 but situated on the basal TiCl3 face with the layer of outer chlorine 
atoms removed. The center in Fig. V-18(A) contains an ethyl group. The vacancy 
(shown by an arrow) is open for olefin coordination and will result in the arrange-
ment shown in Fig. V-I7. Figure V-I8(B) shows the same center but bearing a 
segment of a propylene chain in a helical conformation. The chain is situated 
approximately perpendicular to the crystal surface. It can be seen from Fig. V-18(B) 
that approach of the olefin molecule to the vacancy at the Ti atom in this case is 
largely blocked by the CH2 and CH3 groups of the second propylene unit of the 
chain (counting from the Ti atom). This blocking will be even more pronounced if 
one imagines a poly-4-methyl-I-pentene or polystyrene molecule with large side 
groups attached to the center in place of the polypropylene molecule shown in Fig. 
V-I8(B). It is virtually impossible to "open" the vacancy at the center by rotating 
the polymer chain along the Ti-C or C-C bonds because of the steric repulsion 
between the chain and the catalyst surface. This rotation should be also very limited 
because the second end of the polymer chain will incorporate in a polymer crystal 
not far away from the active center [86]. 
Additional criticism of the scheme shown in Figs. V -16 and V -17 was based on 
careful calculations of steric interactions for this model [87, 88]. These interactions 
were estimated in Refs. [87] and [88] with the application of Lennard-Jones interac-
tion potentials between nonbonded atoms and they can be regarded as a steric 
counterpart of the MO calculations discussed in Section V-3. 
Figure V-I9 shows the schematics of the polymerization center carrying a poly-
mer chain and an approaching polymer molecule (propylene), as well as dihedral 
angles which were varied in the calculations. These angles include 0, the angle 
between the Ti-C bond and the monomer double bond, and V1, O2 , and 0 3 , angles of 
internal rotation in a polymer chain. All other angles (Cl-Ti-Cl, etc.) are fixed 

V -4: Mechanism of Isospecific Chain Growth 
417 
according to the structure of the TiCl3 lateral face where these centers are assumed 
to be located. 
The calculations showed that the intuitive steric considerations on which the 
model [43] of Fig. V-17 is based are not confirmed. In particular, the surface 
chlorine atoms shown in Fig. V-16 (atoms B and F) do not cause the methyl group 
of the coordinated propylene molecule to protrude out of the crystal as Fig. V -17 
shows. The two possible types of propylene coordination are nearly equivalent from 
the steric point of view. AEsteric for these orientations is ~ 0.1-0.2 kcal/mol. 
Electronic energies for these orientations are also the same. This AEsteric is much 
less than the estimated AE for isotactic propylene orientation in a chain, which is 
equal to a few kcal/mol (see Section III-8). Thus, the asymmetry in the arrangement 
of halogen atoms around a transition metal atom proposed in Ref. [43] as the source 
of the isospecificity of the center is not by itself sufficient to explain the isospecific 
power of real polymerization centers. 
Calculations [87, 88] also demonstrated on the quantitative level one effect which 
is obvious from purely qualitative considerations. If one imagines a polymerization 
center with one vacancy situated in the middle of a flat surface and bearing a 
polymer chain (like the center shown in Fig. V-18(B)) the vicinity of the transition 
metal atom is much too crowded to allow an unrestricted approach of an olefin 
molecule. This conclusion stems from the simple fact that one half of the area 
around the metal atom is occupied by the catalyst body and a major part of the other 
half is occupied by the polymer chain attached to the metal atom. On a quantitative 
level, this means a substantial repulsion energy for the olefin approach to such 
centers. This steric hindrance can be greatly reduced if one assumes that the 
polymerization centers are situated not on crystal faces but only on crystal edges [87, 
88]. Careful analysis of non bonding interactions showed that the preferential 
positions of the centers should be on some edges or protruding parts of the crystal 
lattice, allowing polymer chains to tilt and to expose vacancies, thus providing more 
space for olefin coordination. 
Calculations in Refs. [87] and [88] resulted in the discovery of a specific driving 
force for stereoregulation. This stereo-conditioning factor is the fixed orientation of 
the first C-C bond in a polymer chain (the bond immediately following the M-C 
bond) with respect to the surroundings of the active centre. 
This orientation is represented in Fig. V -19 by the angle VI. Computations 
showed that the minimum steric repulsion energy for propylene coordination can be 
achieved for one particular angle VI for a center of given chirality (A or A, see 
Section V-4-a). These angles are +90Â° for the A center and -90Â° for the A center 
[87]. Figure V-20 shows these two centers with the preferential chain orientations. 
For each center two alternative positions of a coordinated olefin are possible: a- and 
c-positions for the A center and b- and d-positions for the A center in Fig. V-20. 
They both provide for "head-to-tail" monomer insertion (the angle Vo in Fig. V-20 
is 0Â°) but differ in the relative positions of the olefin alkyl substituent with respect 
to the second carbon atom of the polymer chain. According to calculations [87, 88] 
a deep minimum (4-9 kcal/mol, depending on the position of the center on a 
catalyst edge) in repulsion energy was found in the cases where the alkyl group of 
the coordinated olefin and the second carbon atom of the growing chain are in

opposite directions-the a case for the A center and the d case for the d center in 
Fig. V-20. 
Thus, the uniform coordination of olefin molecules and their subsequent uni-
form isotactic addition to a polymer chain for a center with one vacancy are 
governed by the inherent chirality of a transition metal site through a specific 
orientation of the first C-C bond in the polymer chain. On the other hand, the 
positions of other C-C bonds (determined by angles V2 and V3 in Fig. V -19) do not 
influence the stereo-orientation of an olefin molecule [87]. This finding is in good 
qualitative agreement with the experimental data on stereoregulation obtained 
from centers with different alkyl groups, as discussed in Section V-4-a. 
In the calculations presented in Refs. [87] and [88] little attention was paid to the 
conformation of all segments of a polymer chain except for its very beginning, M-
CH2-CH-. As can be seen from Fig. V-19, the polypropylene chain in the 
vicinity of a polymerization center is bent in such a way that it is "moved" as far as 
possible from the metal atom of the polymerization center and does not block its 
only vacancy. However, it seems more reasonable to assume that the chain occupies 
much of the space over the polymerization center. In this case it would interfere 
sterically with the approaching olefin molecule.

A model of a polymerization center which takes into account this interference of 
a polymer chain and still readily explains its isospecific action was presented in Ref. 
[42]. The chemical scheme for the chain growth on this center is shown in Fig. V-4. 
The center has two vacancies in addition to three halogen atoms and a growing 
polymer chain. One of the vacancies is sterically blocked by the chain and another 
is open for olefin coordination. Such a center can be formed as a result of a partial 
reduction of a transition metal atom. The possibility of the existence of polymeri-
zation centers with two vacancies was initially proposed in Ref. [43]. Figure V-21 
shows such a center situated on the basal plane of the MCl3 lattice. The upper layer 
of chlorine atoms was completely removed from the surface as the result of surface 
alkylation and the subsequent reduction of metal atoms. Such centers can be easily 
"placed" on the lateral surface also. When a small group (an ethyl group in Fig.

V-21 (A)) is attached to the center both its vacancies are nearly equally open for 
olefin coordination. However, when the growing polypropylene chain is instead 
attached to the center (Fig. V-21(B)) the situation changes markedly. One of the 
vacancies (marked by arrow I in Fig. V-21(B)) is strongly blocked by the second 
monomer unit of the growing chain. The distance between the CHz group of the 
second monomer unit (the y-carbon atom in the chain) and the transition metal 
atom is so small that electronic interaction between them is possible, making the 
end of the polymer chain a quasi-bidentate ligand with weak secondary bonding

The second vacancy of the center (marked by arrow 2 in Fig. V-21(B)) is free and 
an olefin molecule can easily coordinate to it. 
Two possible orientations of a propylene molecule coordinated to such a center 
that result in "head-to-tail" monomer addition can be envisaged. They are shown in 
Fig. V-22. In both these orientations the propylene double bond is parallel to the 
Ti-C bond. Figure V-22(A) shows the orientation in which the propylene methyl 
group and the first C-C bond of the polymer chain are in opposite directions. This 

V -4: Mechanism of Isospecific Chain Growth 
421 
arrangement corresponds to the propylene coordination shown in Fig. V-20(A) and 
results in the eventual isotactic addition of the propylene molecule to the chain. 
The insertion reaction proceeds in the following way. After the Ti-C bond of 
the center and the propylene double bond are broken and new Ti-C and C-C 
bonds are formed as shown in Fig. V -4, the polymer molecule becomes connected 
to the transition metal atom at the site of the former free vacancy (shown by arrow 
2 in Fig. V-21 (BÂ». During the insertion process the polymer molecule increases its 
length by one monomer unit (2.17 A) and moves away from the center. After the 
insertion is complete, the methyl group of the last added propylene molecule has 
the same position with respect to the chain as the methyl group marked 1 in Fig. 
V-22(A) (these two methyl groups are separated by one turn of the polypropylene 
helix). As a result of the chain movement, the CH2 group of the second unit in the 
chain (marked 2 in Fig. V-22(AÂ» is lifted away from the previously blocked second 
vacancy (arrow I in Fig. V-21(BÂ» and leaves it accessible for monomer coordi-
nation. Finally, the breaking of the original Ti-C bond in the insertion reaction 
creates a new vacancy. The new vacancy is blocked from monomer approach by 
the CH2 group which originally was the last group of the chain and now belongs 
to the second monomer unit of the chain (compare with Fig. V-23). 
Thus, the addition of a monomer molecule to the chain results in the complete 
restoration of the original center structure: it again has the Ti-C bond and two 
vacancies, one of which is blocked and the second of which is open for monomer 
coordination. However, the position of the new Ti-C bond and both vacancies has 
changed with respect to the center: they both have turned by 120Â°. After the 
insertion of the next monomer molecule a further "turn" of the Ti-C bond and the 
vacancy positions takes place, etc. The active centers shown in Figs. V-21 and 
V-22(A) therefore have three interchangeable positions in constrast to the active 
center model presented in Refs. [38]-[40] which has only two such positions. 
Figure V-22(B) demonstrates the type of propylene coordination which eventu-
ally results in syndiotactic addition of monomer to the chain. It is evident from this 
figure that this position is sterically less advantageous than that resulting in iso-
addition (Fig. V-22(AÂ». Detailed analysis shows [42] that at distances between the 
transition metal atom and propylene molecule of the order of2.5-3 A, the dominant 
steric repUlsion for syndio-coordination occurs between the methyl group of the 
propylene molecule and the CH and CH 2 groups of the first unit in the chain as 
well as the CH2 group of the second unit. 
This conclusion was proved on a semiquantitative level by the calculation of the 
steric interaction energy for two modes of approach of a propylene molecule to the 
center, one resulting in isotactic and the other resulting in syndiotactic addition to 
the chain. These calculations were carried out in Ref. [42] with the method of 
atom-atom potentials, similar to that used in Refs. [87, 88]. Only olefin-polymer 
chain interactions were considered, the interactions between the olefin and sur-
rounding halogen atoms being assumed equal for both approaches. 
The results of these calculations are shown in Fig. V-23. They demonstrate that 
the approach of a propylene molecule to the center leading to isospecific coordi-
nation is more advantageous than that leading to syndio-coordination, especially 
at short distances between the olefin and the metal atom. Out-of-plane bending of

olefin in the coordinated state (shown in Fig. V-19) decreases the magnitude of 
the repulsion but iso-coordination remains more favorable. Finally, the cis-opening 
of the propylene double bond and the change ofH-C-C angles from 120Â° to 109Â° 
results in a further decrease of the repulsion energy. But in this case also the 
iso-position of the propylene unit is more favorable (Fig. V-23). The llEsteric value 
between iso- and syndio-additions was estimated [42] to be ca. 7 kcal/mol.

tures ofisospecific polymerization centers presented in Ref. [42] and Refs. [87] and

[87,88] is situated on the crystal edge and the center with two vacancies (center B) 
[42] is situated on the basal face of a MCl3 lattice. Both centers bear ethyl groups, 
shown as two partially overlapped spheres with van der Waals radii of 2 A. 
According to 13C_ NMR data [80] such centers with small alkyl groups provide only 
slight isospecificity for propylene addition to a chain (kiso/ksyndiO ~ 4). 
The unique conformation of the ethyl group in center A is mainly due to 
repulsion between its methyl group and a chlorine atom (marked a in Fig. V-24) in 
the upper halogen layer. This unique conformation leads to preferential propylene 
coordination at the single vacancy (arrow 1) with its methyl group aimed in the 
direction opposite to that of the CH3 group of the ethyl ligand in the center [87,88]. 
The center B with two vacancies also has its ethyl group in a preferred confor-
mation. The preference in this case, however, is mainly due to the repulsion between 
its methyl group and the transition metal atom (marked Kin Fig. V-24) next to the 
transition metal atom of the polymerization center. When such a center with two 
vacancies bears a short alkyl group both vacancies are open for olefn coordina-
tion.11 An olefin molecule can approach the vacancies along directions 2 and 3 
corresponding to the positions of the metal orbitals for octahedral symmetry. It can 
be noticed that when the distance between the center and an olefin is 2.5-3 A (the 
chlorine atom diameter) the propylene orientation can be influenced by transition 
metal atoms close to the center. In particular, for the center B shown in Fig. V-24 
transition metal atoms to the left of both approach paths are closer to an olefin 
molecule than those to the right. This arrangement will condition olefin molecules 
to approach polymerization centers with their alkyl groups in the direction opposite 
to that of the closest metal atom (in this case, with their alkyl groups aimed to the 
right with respect to the approach paths). This asymmetry in the arrangement of 
the metal atoms closest to the vacancies is the result of the lattice chirality (see Fig. 
V-IS) for all MX3 crystals active in olefin polymerization (TiC13, VC13, CrC13, 
TiBr3' etc.). This effect of the closest metal atoms on the isospecificity ofpolymeri-
zation centers explains also why a variation in metal-metal distances in the MC13 
lattice (M = Ti, V, Cr, Fe) results in the variation of the catalyst isospecificity (See 
Section 111-6).

Concluding Remarks on the Polymerization Mechanism 
The scope of the existing experimental data on the mechanism of olefin polymeri-
zation with heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts and proposed models of poly-
merization centers can be discussed within two different mechanistic conceptions: 
(a) olefin polymerization as a particular case of vinyl polymerization, and (b) olefin 
polymerization as a particular case of a reaction catalyzed by organic derivatives 
of transition metals. 
11 As was discussed earlier, when a polymer molecule is attached to such a center, only one of these two 
vacancies is available for olefin coordination (vacancy 3).

V: Mechanism of Isospecific Olefin Polymerization 
Numerous attempts were made to classify this polymerization reaction as a 
radical, anionic, or cationic reaction by analogy with the well-known mechanisms 
of vinyl polymerization-see reviews [1-3]. Usually the term "coordination" was 
added to such definitions to emphasize the possible role of a transition metal atom 
in the preliminary weakening of the olefin double bond. The most popular of these 
attempts was the description of this reaction as a "coordination -anionic" process. 
The following arguments were usually used for the justification of this classification: 
(i) The polymerization is characterized by the primary addition of olefin mole-
cules to the growing polymer chain (Reaction V-14) with the CHz group of 
the added molecule being always the last group of the chain (see Section III-l-a 
for experimental confirmation of this statement). Such monomer addition is 
typical for the anionic polymerization mechanism whereas both radical and 
cationic reactions require the CHR group to be the last group of a growing 
chain. 
(ii) The anionic mechanism is determined by the polarity of the transition 
metal-carbon bond: MH _Co- . 
(iii) Polyolefin chains are usually free of chain defects and branching. Such 
behavior is also typical for anionic polymerization reactions whereas both 
radical and cationic polymerizations processes are prone to chain isomeri-
zation reactions (e.g., short and long branches in radical polyethylene or 
extensive chain isomerization in cationic polypropylene). 
(iv) The significance of the coordination step in the coordination-anionic mecha-
nism follows from the p-value for the polymerization reaction of substituted 
styrenes (Section I-5-b). 
Nowadays most of these justifications are not regarded any more as conclusive. 
For example, qualitative considerations [42] and quantitative calculations [87, 88] 
indicate that the primary addition of olefin molecules to a polymer chain is mostly 
determined by steric factors (polymerization center positioning on the catalyst 
surface) rather than by electronic ones. Experimental data show that propylene 
polymerization with soluble Ziegler-Natta catalysts at low temperature (e.g., 
VClcanisole-AlEtzCl) to the syndiotactic polymer proceeds with the secondary 
addition of olefin molecules to polymer chains whereas the structures of polymeri-
zation centers, bond polarity, and the mechanism proposed (olefin insertion into 
the transition metal-carbon bond) are similar to those envisaged for isospecific 
polymerization centers [89, 90]. The order of olefin reactivity (see Section 1-5), 
which is usually regarded as a manifestation of the anionic mechanism, is deter-
mined mostly by steric factors. 
Thus, whereas the principal features of olefin polymerization with heterogeneous 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts are better described by the "coordination-anionic" poly-
merization mechanism than by other proposed classifications, this mechanistic 
assignment should be regarded as strictly formal and bearing no vital meaning such 
as it has in the case of, for example, styrene or butadiene polymerization with alkali 
metal-aromatic complexes. It is more justified to regard this reaction as a separate

polymerization mechanism of vinyl compounds with its combination of charac-
teristic features. 
On the other hand, the reaction of olefin insertion into a transition metal-carbon 
bond can be regarded to be firmly established as the principal mechanistic step of 
the reaction. Analysis of possible analogies with other reactions of this type (olefin 
oligomerization, dimerization, isomerization, hydroformylation, etc.) involving the 
participation of metal-alkyl and metal-hydrogen bonds have proved to be fruitful. 
The mechanism of stereoregulation in this polymerization process remains poorly 
understood. However, attempts to explain stereo regulation as the consequence of 
the inherent chirality of MX3 lattices, possibly translated into isospecificity of 
polymerization centers through the participation of the alkyl group orientation in 
the center, appear the most attractive.
