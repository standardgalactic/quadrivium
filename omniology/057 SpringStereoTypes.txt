MVC “Controller”
@RestController

adds @ResponseBody

deﬁned by Domain-Driven Design (Evans, 2003) as “a 
mechanism for encapsulating storage, retrieval, and search 
behavior which emulates a collection of objects”
@Service
Indicates that an annotated class is a “Service”, originally 
deﬁned by Domain-Driven Design (Evans, 2003) as “an 
operation offered as an interface that stands alone in the 
model, with no encapsulated state.”
