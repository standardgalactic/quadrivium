long been regarded b y  the
uninitiated as a solitary pursuit.
We are supposed to sit for days
on end, without food or drink,
in s emi- dar k ened r o o m s
huddled over the keyboard
with only the strange glow of
the screen to keep us company.
It c an happen, o f  course,
though I have yet to go for a
period o f  longer than t w o
hours without s ome f o r m
(usually liquid) sustenance. All
the signs point in the opposite
direction but have you tried
convincing people? Show
them the two joystick ports on
the 6 4  a n d  point  t o  t h e
increasing number of  games
which require the use of both.
Tell them about the growing
number of computer clubs and
their ever increasing member-
ship. Show them that programs
are written for useful purposes
and not for their own sakes;
indeed tell them that many
programs, a n d  n o t  j u s t
commercial ones, are written
by teams of people, someone
designing t h e  gr aphic s ,
someone else the music and so
on. All to no avail.
The answer c ould hav e
arrived i n  t h e  s hape o f
Compunet. A t  last Commo-
dore owners can communicate
with each other through the
medium o f  their computers.
By attaching the modem to
your CBM 64 you could be at
6frilviENTE
the forefront of a whole new
form o f  communication. O f
course, viewdata (  o f  which
Compunet is another manifes-
tation) is not new. Prestel and
its offshoot Micronet 800 have
been with us for some years
and it is also true that neither
have really fulﬁlled their initial
promise. Prestel suffers from a
debilitating identity crisis: is it
aimed at the business or the
domestic user? It began as a
method of using all that spare
telephone capacity during off-
peak times but it  was soon
adopted by diverse sections of
the business community. I n
order t o  repair the balance
Micronet 800 was  started.
Directed at the home micro
user it offered an innovative
and well presented package
(and still does) but it is very one
sided — Micronet provides the
information i n  t he for m o f
news, i n f o r m a t i o n  a n d
software a n d  t h e  u s e r
downloads it.
Compunet o f f e r s  t h e
revolutionary advance o f  a
two-way service. The user can
up-load his own software as
well as  down-loading other
people's, You c an ﬁnd out
more in the article on the new
service in this issue, Let me just
ﬁnish by saying that Compunet
offers Commodore owners the
chance to dispel forever the
myth of the computer hermit.
The Plus/4
The other big recent launch
from Commodore is, of course,
the new machines. Last month
we lo o k e d  a t  t h e  VIC's
replacement, the C16 and word
is already coming through that
it's selling extremely well. At
the price and with its speciﬁca-
tions this is not at all surprising.
The Plus/4 which we look at
this month is rather different.
The market does not already
exist for it. Instead it will have
to create its own.
The idea behind the Plus/4
certainly looks promising and
we shall take a look at the built-
in software next month.
For t h e  m o m e n t  t h e
hardware is considered by our
reviewer w h o  i s  n o t  u n -
impressed.
All the best
This issue also contains a large
number of graphics related
articles. T h e  Commodor e
machines are all renowned for
the e x c e l l e n t  g r a p h i c
capabilities but there is also
room for  improvement. You
can choose the solution which
most suits you by reading our
reviews of lightpens, of Logo
and the Turtle, of the Koala Pad
and o f  many o f  the Com-
modore drawing packages.
So whatever your interest
there is something in this issue
of Your Commodore for you.
And strange as it  may seem
(and i t  often confuses u s
although this is the January
issue y o u  s h o u l d  b e
reading this before Christmas:
so fr om a ll o f  us  at Your
Commodore may we wish you
a very merry Christmas and a

Following the review
of the Commodore 16
last month, Mike
Roberts places its big
brother, the Plus/4,
under the magnifying
glass.
THE COMMODORE PLUS/4 IS
Commodore's ﬁrst entry into
the top level home/very small
business b r a c k e t .  C o m -
modore said that i t  wasn't
suitable for running a business
but went on to say that it could
be used in certain applications
by a 'professional' person. This
is one o f  t he most honest
statements that I have heard a
computer company say on the
subject of the business use of a
home c o m p u t e r .  C l i v e
Sinclair onc e said that y ou
could run a power station on a
ZX80 (1K RAM, 4K ROM no
keyboard!)
Wher e t h i s  bus ines s
subject comes from is the four
built in software packages —
wordprocessor, spreadsheet,
database, a n d  graphics —
hence Plus/4, but more about
this is a later article.
Externally the Plus/4 is a
gunmetal, wedge shaped box
with a  keyboard ta king up
most of the room on the top
and ports and interfaces taking
up the whole of the back and
sides. Now it becomesobvious
why Commodore opted for
the smaller type of connector
instead of keeping it the same
as they have for ages. If the
normal 'chunky' ty pe edge
connectors and D  sockets
were used there would not be
enough room around the edge
of the machine.
The magic touch
The keyboard excels even
Commodor e's  b e a u t i f u l
quality although some people
express reservations when
they ﬁrst get their dabble with
it. However, after a period of
use everybody loves it.
The k ey boar d i s  v er y
6 s imilar  t o  the SX-64, and is
angled, s c u lp t u r e d  a n d
curved. This ma k es typing on it
a r eal dream. T h e  layout
consists of 68 k eys, 60 of which
are normal and 4 function key

above the top row and four
cursor control keys arranged
in a cross shape. One odd thing
about these keys is the shape,
they look like arrows —  the
way t h e  arrow is  pointing
indicates the direction that
the cursor will go in.
The ports around the back
and sides of the box show a
departure fr om t h e  64/VIC
stable. The VIC and 64 had
almost identical I/O.
All change
Most things, however, have
been changed; the cartridge/
expansion p o r t  has  b e e n
reduced in size to stop people
shoving CBM 64 cartridges into
it. I do not know whether the
highly advanced structure of
the CBM 64's slot with its
facility for second processors
is duplicated on the Plus/4. But
given t h e  natur e o f  t h e
machine as a small systems/
serious device, this is more
than a distinct possibility.
The Plus/4 support sideways
ROMs; t h e s e  w e r e  ﬁr s t
implemented o n  t h e  BBC
micro some years ago and
computers are starting to get
these featured. Commodore
call t h e m  'F unc tion k e y
packages'. The reason for this
rather strange name is  that
when the machine boots up, it
checks to see if there are any
ROMs attached. If there are
then it will assign each ROM to
a function key. The internal
software uses this system so
pressing Fl gets you into it. If
the ROMs are removed the
function key goes back to its
original state. External ROMs
will go on F2. It is un known
how many ROM cartridges can
be attached to the machine at
once, b u t  t h e r e  i s  t h e
possibility of four (BASIC. the
in-built R O Ms , p lu s  t w o
others).
The two D9 connectors of
the C B M  6 4  h a v e  b e e n
dispensed with and replaced
with min i D I N  connectors.
This means you can only buy
Commodore's  jo y s t ic  ks.
Commodore joysticks are not
the best things in the world.
even their new 'hi-tecP style
ones.
The Cassette r ec or der
soc ket is  also a  mini D I N
connector, this is because the
C16 cassette deck is different
to the old tape decks. The
Plus/4 is at its best with disc
drives, including the new high
speed ones intended for their
new range of machines.
Thanl(fully, Commodore
have left the Serial BUS, and
the audio/video connector
alone. A l l  Commodor e's
existing peripherals, that use
these ports, will work straight
off, s o  t her e a r e  already
printers a n d  d i s c  dr iv es
available f o r  t h e  machine.
However, it may be worth the
wait to get hold of their new
discs which use the cartridge
port and are a lot faster than
the old ones.

H a r d w a r e  R e v ie w
Inside knowledge
Moving o n  t o  t h e  internal
hardware r e v e a ls  s o m e
surprises. Most of the insides is
driven via one big chip. Called
either the 7501 or the TED chip
depending on your inc lina-
tion, i t  c ombines  a  6510
processor a t  2MHz with a
• s o u n d  gener ator , timer s ,
i n p u t / o u t p u t ,  m e m o r y
ban king, a n d  g r a p h ic s
generation. I n  all it  has 19
registers to control things.
Sound quality is as good as
the next mans although it only
has two channels. These can
be two sound channels or one
sound and o n e  nois e ( for
special effects). Nearly all the
advanced sound features of
the SID chip have been left
out lik e AMR, ﬁltering, and
modulation.
Graphics ability is superb. It
is natural that this will b e
compared w it h  t h e  Com-
modore 64 as there are a lot of
similarities in spec. However,
the graphics are different and
there a r e  c ur r ently  t w o
schools of thought as to which
is better the CBM 64 or the
Plus/4.
Simulated sprites
The big difference is sprites.
These wonderful things that
ma ke games programming
easy have been chopped from
the Plus/4. In their place is a
software simulation o f  them
from BASIC where you can
extract an area of the screen
and store it in a string. This
string can then b e recalled
and put back on the screen at
any point. There are also other
options to manipulate these
objects, but they are not true
sprites; a large 120 byte object
takes about a quarter of a
second to write to the screen.
I feel that the world can live
without sprites, for at least
another computer generation
(about 1 8  months ) ; t h e
Commodore 64 and Atari were
just too far ahead of their time.
The trade-off against the
sprites is more colour. The
screen of the C16 can have 128
colours (121 excluding black)
made u p  o f  16 colours, 8
luminenc e le v e ls ,  a n d
ﬂashing. Screen size is 40 x 25
text with four other graphics
modes. The other graphics
modes are 320 x 200 with the
previously mentioned 128
colours being used in a colour
map system. and 160 x 200 in a
multicolour form. Both hires
screens have an option t o
leave four text lines at the
bottom of the screen. There
are s ome other  graphics
modes and options but these
are only available by POKEing.
User deﬁned graphics (UDGs)
are obtained by POKEing and
manipulation of registers.
The manual gives no hint of
these although they are very
straightforward t o  obtain.
When playing with LIDGs one
other f e a t u r e  b e c o m e s
appar ent. A  c h a r a c t e r
generator is 2K long, (256 x 8
bytes) the C16 one is only 1K
long, how come? Well, the
long and short of it is that the
C16 uses a hardware reverse
ﬁeld attribute. The top bit of
the c u r r e n t  c h a r a c t e r
displayed indicates whether it
is inverted o r  not. This has
some advantages a n d  dis -
advantages. The advantage is in
memory consumption. T h e
disadvantages are that you can
only hav e 128 UDGs, and
ﬂashing work s  i n  a  rather
strange way. A  reverse ﬁeld
space is  shown as a  blac k
square. When y ou ﬂash i t
instead o f  getting a  ﬂashing
square nothing happens. This is
quite confusing u n t il y o u
realise that a ﬂashing space
doesn't change.
Other features
Other mo d e s  n o t  d o c u -
mented inc lude Extended
Background Colour  mode,
which gives y ou differ ent
background colours as well as
foreground c olour s , a n d
multicolour characters where
each character can be made
up out of a number of colours.
There may be others but I must
wait until I  get a technical
manual to ﬁnd them out.
This b r in g s  m e  o n t o
another point. The BASIC is
ideal f or  an inexperienced
user or an experienced BASIC
user, b u t  w h a t  about u s
machine c o d e  hac k s  a n d
people w h o  wouldn't us e
BASIC if they were paid to?
The answer is TEDMON.
This is a full feature assembler,
dis as s embler , m o n i t o r ,
debugger. I t  i s  s imilar t o
Extramon 7.5 and is very good
indeed. This ma kes writing
assembly language very easy as
you already have most of the
development software built
in.
The monitor can also be
called b y  using t h e  res et
button. This is a great feature
and is in a little recess just by
the power supply. Press it in
and the machinegoes back to
its power on state — memory
contents are preserved but it
is awkward toget at them. The
beauty of it all is when you
keep the STOP key pressed
down at the same time as you
press in the reset key. The
computer jumps  i n t o  t h e
monitor, key in 'X' (for eXit)
and you are back in BASIC,
complete with intact program.
The manual is  excellent
k i
and way past Commodore's
usual standard. It is informative
and instructional for the ﬁrst
time user. For  t h e  exper-
ienced per s on t h e r e  a r e
memory maps and register
details.
In conclusion
The Plus/4 scores over its little
brother the C16 by having 64K
of memory, and now comes the
good bit — the BASIC has built
in memory ban king so that you
can use the extra memory to
the full. When using hi-res this
only cuts you down to SOK.
Compare that to a BBC that
leaves you with a ﬁfth of that
after hi- r es  has  tak en it s
chun k out. This mammoth
(sorry elefantinel) memor y
will mean that there should be
a lot of huge adventures and
great arcade games o n  t he
mar ket to use these.
The BASIC is identical to
the C16 and all Raid last month
applies her e. This  is  t h e
computer of now, excellent
BASIC, keyboard, software
built in, and best of all a vast
amount of user memory. The
problem is whether it is worth
it at the price — 1299. This is
well below  t h e  BBC w ith
which it  is comparable. But
then the BBC always was over
priced. Only time will tell, as
the Plus/4 is carving a new area
in the market.

COMMODORE W I L L  B E
sponsoring the prestigious 1985
British Computer  Soc iety
Schools' Computer Quiz. I t
commited itself to increasing
the number of computers in
schools in 1984 and sees this
quiz as  a  vehicle f o r  it s
education offensive next year.
Commodore has contributed
sponsorship o f  over £50,000
including prizes, for  schools
worth over £12,500.
In conjunction w it h  t h e
quiz, Commodore is running a
special schools' lo a n  a n d
sponsorship scheme. Every
school taking part in the quiz
will be offered the free loan of
two complete Commodore 64
computer systems for  three
months and, if at the end of the
loan period the school wishes to
keep t h e  loaned systems.
Commodore will match every
£7.00 the school raises with
£3.00.
The quiz comprises a quiz
master and six to eight team
and indiv idual r ounds  o f
questions. Schools in each area
will be asked to select a team of
three pupils — one under 17
years, one under 16 years and
one under 15 years. Local area
heats start in November and
N e w s
the 40 schools thus emerging
as winners of the branch ﬁnals

got t h e  l o t .  Sof t w ar e?
Commodore has just launched
Spirit of the Stones, an arcade
game with 21 locations based
on a scrolling map of the island.
However, as well as a game you
also get the chance to join in a
treasure hunt f o r  4 0 small
talisman, each containing a
single diamond and for  the
Great Wight Eye all of which
have been scattered around
the island. Fortunately, (Or
perhaps unfortunately) y ou
don't have to take the ferry
over to the island to claim the
treasure.
Included with the game is
the book of the Spirit of the
Stones, a tale of smuggling and
the supernatural which tells the
tale of how the talismen came
to be scattered. The book,
written by island resident John
Worsley, is also full of visual
and v erbal c lues  t o  t h e
whereabouts of the stones and
one of the ﬁrst steps for all
would-be treasure hunters
must be the deciphering of the
runes or secret writings which
border the pages.
Those clever enough t o
unlock the key to this puzzle
and ﬁnd one of the talismen
will also be eligible for a share
of the Royalty Fund into which
sop will be deposited for every
package sold. However, the
share-out will not be until 1993
or when the m illio n  ceiling is
reached.

proper keyboard plus RS232, disk-handling, and
serial port facilities, w e  are throwing in a lot of
features of ZX-Interface-1 * as well.
WHY Y O U  S HO UL D G E T A  SPECTRUM SI MULATOR
You can type in (virtually) all these Spectrum
listings from magazines, as well as those for
the 64.
It's a n  incredibly cheap way to  get
facilities of another computer.
And i f you're upgrading from Spectrum to
64, y o u r  o l d  programs d o n 't a l l  become
obsolete.
Spectrum Basic is in many ways easier and
more powerful than Commodore Basic. Why
not compare them for yourself ?

Dear Sir,
I am writing to ask you how do
you program the program-
mable function keys, F1-F8, on
the Commodore 64.
Yours faithfully,
E. Kenworth
Lancashire
We answer,
The function keys on the CBM
64 cannot b e  programmed
from BASIC. If you press one of
these keys, i t  generates a
character and you can then test
for this character using its
ASCII value. They  c an b e
"programmed" using a bit of
machine code. This patches
into the interrupt and tests to
see if there is a function key in
the ﬁrst pos ition o f  t h e
keyboard buffer. If there is, the
keyboard buffer is ﬁlled with
the r e q u i r e d  c o m m a n d
remembering that the buffer is
only t e n  characters long.
Program 1  demons tr ates
this and you can put your own
commands i n t o  t h e  data
statements at the end of the
program. Note that a left arrow
4,--L indicates a carriage return.

Dear Sir,
I am using a Commodore Pet
for my project at school, and
the school has no handbook
for it. I would be grateful if you
could answer these question%
for me:
a) H o w  'do y ou get auto
repeat on all keys on the
PET?
b) W h a t  a r e  t h e  s o u n d
channels and how are they
used?
c) Wh a t  is the PEEK location
for reading the keyboard?
Yours faithfully,
Jim Watts
Portsmouth
We answer,
a. Y o u  cannot get auto repeat
on all of the keys on the
PET.
b. Location 59467 controls the
sound. POKE this location
with sixteen to turn on the
sound and POKE it with
zero to turn the sound off.
If you PRINT CHR$(7) a bell
will sound and automati-
c
cally turn off the sound.
Location 231 h o l d  t h e
chime time of the bell. Try
POKE231,0:PRINICHR$(7).
This location defaults t o
sixteen. Location 59466 sets
the musical timbre of the
sound. POKE this with a
number (0-255) to change
it. The best values to use
are 15, 31 and 51. Location
59464 contains the actual
note to be played.
Location 151 returns which
key is being pressed (255 if
no key psessed).
Location 152 is one when
the s hift k ey  is  being
pressed.
Location 158 holds  t h e
number o f  characters in
the keyboard buffer. Thus
POKE158,0 will clear the
keyboard buffer.
Location 227 is the length
of the keyboard buffer.
Location 623 contains the
characters in the keyboard
buffer. If you extend the
keyboard buffer by using a
command such as POKE
227,40 you will overwrite
ﬁrst cassette buffer which
should be ﬁne in nearly all
circumstances.
Dear Sir,
own a Commodore 64 and
' Your Commodore' covers a lot
of my interests. lam just getting
used to the BASIC language
and am taking great interest in
your 'BASIC Facts' series.
I would like to see more on
graphics, especially 'Fun Grap-
hics', such as how to get 3-0
graphics.
Could you tell me how to
move a graphic using keys on
the keyboard. Also, could you
please t ell me what a  user
deﬁned graphic is.
Yours faithfully,
A. Denman,
Barnsley
We answer,
The program over the page
demonstrates how to move a
sprite about the screen using
the keys indicated in the REMS.
This may be easily adapted to
move any other object.

A User Deﬁned Graphic
(UDG) is a character specially
designed by a programmer (i.e.
you!). The CBM 64 has 256 pre-
deﬁned characters and a vector
pointing at  these. They are
stored i n  R O M .  Yo u  can
change the vector t o point
elsewhere in RAM and deﬁne
your own characters. On the 64
you have to redeﬁne all of the
characters so the best thing to
do is to copy all of the character
information out of ROM and
then redeﬁne as many as you
require.
Dear Sir,
I a m  strongly thinking o f
purchasing a disc drive for my
Commodore 64. But, I  have
read in  different magazines
that the Commodore 1541 disc
drive is a little bit sluggish.
Please could you t ell m e
E
disc drives which are compa-
tible with the Commodore 64.
Yours faithfully,
Graeme Lee
West Sussex
We answer,
There are no other disc drives
that may be directly bolted on
to the .
the specialised serial port used
by Commodore. The speed of
the 1541 is mainly limited by the
speed of this cable. There is at
least one add on extra that you
can buy that will considerably
speed up the 1541 but might
have other memory or buffer
limitations. Alternatively you
can b u y a n  IEEE cartridge
(which should plug. onto the
user port) and this will open up
the whole world of IEEE devices
including t h e  Commodore
single and twin disc versions as
well as hard discs, ten pen
plotters and so on. A cartridge
like this may cost around 00.
Dear Sir,
Two weeks ago I  bought a
Commodore WC 20 computer
from a  lo cal shop, T h e
computer was reduced i n
price from 1129.95 to E99.95.
Not knowing very much about
computers, b u t  interested
enough in buying one for my
own education as well as my
children's, I thought this offer
represented a  g o o d  buy.
Unfortunately, having bought
the item I  n o w  ﬁnd that
software availability is being
run down for this particular
machine. Furthermore, I  am
informed that the supply of 3-
16K RAM may prove difﬁcult as
shops are running down stocks
in order to make way for the
new Commodore 16.
At the time, I was not made
aware o f  t he forthcoming
change in machines and I am
anxious to ﬁnd out if the new
Commodore 16 software can
be used on the VIC 20, or if an
expansion unit can be obtained
to bring it into line with the '16'.
If so, where can I purchase such
a unit?
Having read your ﬁrst issue
of the magazine, lam delighted
that a series on VIC Games
Programming is available in an
easy t o  understand format.
However, i n  view  o f  t h e
difﬁculties described above,
could you let me know where I
can get games such as 'Multi
Tron , described on page 35 of
your October issue, and also
whether my computer can be
updated or not.
Yours faithfully,
P 1 Lycett,
Stafford
We answer,
Commodore 16 software will
not run on the VIC 20. As this
machine is being phased out,
stocks o f  games w ill u n -
doubtedly dwindle although
all the current owners will still
want to buy new games. There
are still plenty o f  shops
stocking a  large range o f
excellent games. If you have
trouble getting software o r
RAM expansion boards then
there are certain to be adverts
in your local press from people
wanting to sell their second
hand equipment. The VIC 20
cannot be upgraded to become
a Commodore 16.

Dear Sir,
I have a VIC 20 and a Zero
Electronics 64K RAM card. I
want to get into, and use, the
'other' 32K since I understand
enough to wreak 32K out of the
card. The October issue o f
Your Commodore said "There
is indeed 64K o f  RAM..."
(Mastering Machine Code,
p.7): although I have a VIC 20,
have 1 some 'ﬁddling around'
to do with my card?
• H e x  doesn't vex but all
helpers I turn to don't speak
English! Can you assist?
Yours faithfully,
B.E. Rivett,
Devon
We answer,
The article was referring to the
CBM 64 when it said "There is
indeed 64K of RAM...", I do not
know anything speciﬁc about
this particular RAM card but
there are some guidelines I can
give. There must be a manual
supplied with it telling you how
to use it. If  this manual is
unclear t h en  t r y  getting
in contact with the manu-
facturers. The principle will
probably b e one of  paging
banks of RAM in and out. This
means that you use bank one
which contains 32K, then you
page this out and page bank
two in and access the second
32K. To access the ﬁrst bank,
you have to page it back in
again. Therefore you can look
at either bank but not both at
the same time.
Dear Sir,
I h ave just purchased a
Commodore 64. Needless to
say I am lost! The hand book
tells the minimum. Could you
advise me on a better book (or
books) where a t  least t he
graphic symbols are listed.
Yours faithfully,
T. Davis

Dear Sir,
Please can you help me with a
simple problem. I  am having
great difﬁculties trying t o
devise a  random number
generator in a machine code
program on my CBM64. Have
you got any ideas?
We answer,
There are a number of ways of
doing this. Firstly. you can use
any of the memory locations in
the 64 which are constantly
changing. A good example of
this is the clock. You can also
time a n y  variable length
operation in your own code
such as how long a  key is
pressed down.

Display the time of
day on the screen
whilst programming
with this handy 4 .
machine code routine
from Les Allan.
HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED
how much time is spent on the
family computer when writing
or debugging a program? Well
here's a chance to ﬁnd out with
a simple screen clock that can
be used either as a digital clock
to keep an eye on things or as a
time elapsed indicator.
Buried away  ins ide t h e
computer i s  t h e  Complex
Interface Adaptor (CIA) chip
which performs as well as many
other things the Time of Day
Clock (TOD). This is a special
purpose timer for  real time
applications. The TOD consists
of a 24 hour (AM/PM) clock
with s e c  resolution being
organised i n t o  4  separate
registers: 10ths of a second,
seconds, minutes, and hours.
The AM/PM ﬂag is located in
SCREEN
CLOCK
'

the MSB of the hours register.
A speciﬁc sequence o f
events must be followed for the
proper setting o f  the TOD.
TOD is automatically stopped
whenever a write is made to the
MS13 register and will not start
again until a write to the 10ths
of a  second register. This
assures that t h e  T O D  w ill
always start at any desired time
since the entered time is frozen
until the ﬁnal write to the 10th
of seconds is made.
Window display
This program creates a window
in the top right hand side of the
screen to continuously display
the time. The interrupt routine
is re-routed to a machine code
program loc ated h i g h  i n
memory SCF08 so that every
time an interrupt occurs the
RE A DY .
clock can be updated. The only
limitation t o  this program is
that the interrupt pointers must
not be altered by  any other
program.
The program work s  b y
taking the HEX value of data,
converting it to binary coded
decimal, carrying out a check
to see if it is within the legal
range a n d  P O K in g  i n t o
memory. Hex data has been
used because it keeps the data
statement tidy, makes it easier
to read and is the working code
of the machine. Providing that
the ﬁnal check sum is OK the
machine c o d e  r o u t in e  i s
activated and the display set to
enter the correct time of day.
Error trapping is  again pro-
vided to ensure that only the
legal range o f  time can be
entered. When the values have
been correctly entered, press-
ing any key will start the clock
from that desired time.

THE COMMODORE 64 IS  A  VERY
sophisticated computer; its sound and
graphics capabilities make it one of the
best devices available to the home user.
But, why, oh why was the machine not
ﬁnished with a state of the art BASIC? This,
it seems was an over-sight, in an effort on
the part of Commodore to get a 64K
computer "out the door" earlier, in case
they were beaten t o the punch by
Japanese Cowboys or English whizz-kids.
Speciﬁcation is everything these days
though, so we are stuck with superb
facilities that cannot be easily accessed.
Or can they? For graphics, we can
purchase software solutions t o  our
hardware problems in the form of
graphics software.
Graphics Software
Let me demonstrate how a problem to a
novice can be easily overcome with
software. To draw a line on a computer
you have to (a) PLOT an invisible point
and (b) DRAW from that point to another
point, and for both of those points you
need precise co-ordinates like so:
10 PLOT 100,100
20 DRAW 50,5
This means you've instructed the
computer to go from the bottom left of
the screen (0,0) to 100 pixels across to the
right and 100 pixels upwards (100,100)
without making any marks on the screen
(PLOT). Then from 100,100 drawing a line
50 pixels up, producing a diagonal line
from 100,100 to 150,150. I don't know
about you, but this kind of thing gives me
a headache after the 400th line of my
drawing.
The same problem on the same 64
becomes simple when you boot up your
graphics program, like PAINTPIC from
Kuma. You can select the "line" option,
move the cursor with your joystick or keys
to the start position, mark it and move to
the ﬁnish position. The second method is
more accurate and less work, especially in
complex drawings where you don't Hant
to have to work out the exact co-ordinates
of single pixels.
There are essentially three types of
graphics software available to the 64 user:
Draw or painting programs, languages,
and Games Designers or Sprite Editors.
Draw programs
E
With Draw programs, or  "painting"
programs as they are sometimes known,
the process of producing graphics screens
or titles for your programs is reduced to
merely "drawing" your design directly
onto the screen, a bit like the old Etch-
a-sketch gadgets. They are however a bit
more sophisticated than that, as you have
the facility to colour individual pixels or
lines, or even whole blocks of the screen
at will.
There are quite a few draw packages
available now. DOODLE by Quicksilva,
for instance. This is a disc based drawing
system, and as such, is quite advanced (if a
teeny bit slow.) You can perform a great
many juggling acts with a  drawing:
copying a section to "stamp" all over the
screen, or use as a brushpoint, "box",
"line" a nd "circle" modes, and
something called ZOOM, which enlarges
an area of the screen, to allow you to draw
with greater precision.
Another two similar packages are the
cassette based systems, PAIN1PIC by
Kuma and PANORAMA by Talent. Of
the two I ﬁnd PAINTPIC the better,
inspite of the fact it's less user-friendly
that PANORAMA, i n  part because
PANORAMA has some really annoying
sounds in it. Why do you need sound in a
drawing program? I ﬁnd myself asking the
same question. The cursor stutters across
the screen to a kind of synthetic bell
sound, which on auto-repeat clatters like
an empty machine-gun. In the end I had
to turn the sound off to concentrate. Not
only that, but if you make any mistake like
entering an option which is not available,
you get the most horrendous noise. I
don't know what it's meant to represent,
but to me it sounds like a metallic
squirrel being cut in half by a circular
saw in an echo chamber! (Screeekra-
nnnnnnnnnnnngggssshhhhhhhhhh!!!)
PAINTPIC is a far quieter piece of kit. It
is fast, accurate and colourful, making full
use of the Commodore's capacity for
multicoloured drawings. It's a shame the
manual ic so difﬁcult to understand.
The last piece I  looked at was
something called ROLF HARRIS'
PICTURE BUILDER. This is a kind of
computer aided nursery block program
from the originators of the machine itself.
You can use the character blocks on the
machines keyboard to build up pictures
of low-res or character graphics. Simple
stuff, you may say, but computer
education must begin somewhere, so why
not with toddlers?

Computer Graphics language
The second type of program is by far the
most far reaching and useful of the three,
as it is the computer graphics language.
ULTRABASIC '64 is the best example
of this type o f  program. T h e disc
based ULTRABASIC 6 4  i s  a n  e x -
tended BASIC, boosting the (not to put
too ﬁne a point on it) prehistoric BASIC
supplied with your machine. This means
you can reap the beneﬁts of built in
TURTLE functions, an d  generally
enhanced control of  colour, line and
sound capability. An excellent piece of
software with an interactive tutorial on
the disc, and well written documentation.

The ﬁnal, and most popular area o f
interest in graphics at the present is
Games Designers and Sprite Editors.
Games Designers do just that; allow you
to create your own games, which you can
play or lend to your friends. Such beasts
for the 64 are the excellent GAMES

friendly. GAMES CREATOR allows the
user to deﬁne his own sprites, back-
grounds, bullets and sound effects, even
music, with no difﬁculty. And they're not
just simple effects either! You've got
jumping and gravity effects, scrolling
backgrounds, animated sprites, f u ll
length musical pieces and explosive, not
to say good'n'noisy sound effects. This is a
very detailed a n d  satisfying games
constructor, the only drawback being the
need to drive all your new games using
the master program. OK, so you can't sell
your game and become rich, but you can
E 2 4 re-design your own favourite game. As
this type o f  program goes GAMES
CREATOR is very good.
GO SPRITE is a bright and racy sprite
creation and animation package, with lots
of icons and arrows pointing to applicable
parts o f  t he screen. I t  displays the
different "frames" of your sprite like
frames of ﬁlm, and animates them while
you watch. You alter the sprite either with
keyboard controls or a joystick, moving
the cursor to the facility you want to use
and pressing the ﬁre button. Of this type
of program, Go Sprite is the best I've seen.
Two other packages are not so good.
GRAPHICS MASTER is OK but nothing
new and a bit oddly laid out. It does
however have more colour combinations
than many other sprite editors I've seen.
GRAPHICS DESIGNER is possibly the
most erratic piece of software I've ever
seen. It is "User-violent", in that at no
time d o  you know what i t  is that
the program is doing! The ﬂimsy manual is
garbled and t h e o n  screen prompts
evasive. For instance, what would you
make of the phrase "F?". I know what I'd
say!
Drawing to an end
The applications of these pieces is up to
you. It is possible to use them for games,
business graphics. animated cartoons or
even art for its own sake. I suggest that
before you buy any package that you
match its facilities with your skill and your
needs.
One last point. I'm fed up with people
buying d raw  programs a n d  doing
"abstract computer art" or "computer.
type" pictures; using an art program like a
computer instead of using a computer
like an artistic tool. For goodness sake,
when you buy a draw program. DRAW!
Be creative. Don't just doodle. There
aren't nearly enough people in the world
who know about computers and the arts,
so there's plenty of room for you in the
computer art world of the future.

FIRST
AID
for your 64
Computers, like people, are fallible. They need the right
combination of code and care to perform effectively in the
business or the home. And that requires ﬁrst hand knowledge
from you to creatc a healthy operating environment for your
Commodore 64.
Knowledge about machine language, about the lesser known
qualities of the 64, about the disc drives, graphics, and about the
tricks and tips to keep your 64 on line. That's why First Publishing
has now launched in the UK a series of high quality books and
software packages to provide a complete health care kit for your
64. Commodore 64 users throughout Europe have already found it
a tonic. We think you will, too.

Simon Rockman calls up
Commodore's new number,
Compunet, an on-line
database ser vice
Commodore 6
COMPUNET IS THE BIGGEST THING
that has happened to the Commodore 64
since the machine was launched two years
ago. When you buy  the Commodore
communications modem you get a year's
free subscription t o the new database
service. Anyone who is used to dial-up
databases will ﬁnd Compunet a  cross
between PRESTEL and bulletin boards.
PRESTEL is a passive system where only
specially authorised people (Information
Providers (IP's) are allowed to put up
pages; however, Compunet has had a
section called T he Jungle".
Here anyone can put up a page of text
or a program and charge for it. When
another user wants to read that page or to
load that program they can buy it. The
money is automatically debited from their
account with half of it going tot he person
who provided the information and the
other half to Compunet. The maximum
price for a page is £999.99.
When dealing with large sums like this
the system needs to be secure against the
intruders and hackers who could put up a
page under their own name and then use
a stolen ID  and password t o read it.
Compunet is one of the most secure pub-
lic systems invented. Every Compunet
modem has its own ﬁngerprint, a code
number built into it which is speciﬁc to
your ID. To use a different account you
need a different modem. This level of
security should open the door to major-
transactions such as booking holidays and
home banking. The system sounds great
so lets look at what happens when you go
to use it.
Compunet in use
After the small black box arrives from
Commodore you rush to the computer
and unwrap the package. The manual is a
single ﬂimsy sheet of paper, the rest of it is
on the system. (I have never understood
why people s till lik e  us ing paper
directories when they could use the
computer they are talking to do the work
of looking things u p  for  them). The
modem contains an 8K ROM. This holds
your secret serial number and some of the
routines necessary f o r  a  conversion
with the Compunet mainframe. The rest
of the routines need to be loaded, from
tape, disc or from the mainframe itself. It
is in this last form that the program is ﬁrst
sent to you.
To call up the mainframe you simply
press shifted C return; this is the connect
command and prompts you with the
question "Dial Number?". Depending on
where you are in the UK you dial a
telephone number given in the leaﬂet
which comes w ith t he modem. The
modem then dials the number out like a
normal telephone. When the modem
ﬁnishes dialling it prompts you with the
message, -
border changes colour as it connects.
Compunet does not have a mainframe to
itself (although this  is  supposed t o
change); i t  shares time o n a DEC 10
mainframe owned b y  ADP computer
services, whose telephone line it also uses.
While the two computers seem to be
doing nothing during logging in they are
in fact chatting away. logging you into the
correct area of the DEC and establishing
who you are (from the code number in
your modem).
When these fermalities are completed,
Compunet asks you for  your ID  and
password. The ID is an eight letter code
which is used to identify you as the source
of any information which you upload. At
the moment the password can only be
changed by  Compunet; however the
facility for the user to change the pass-
word will become available and will add
an extra level of security.
Once logged in ,  Compunet does
the clever trick of interrogating your '64. It
ﬁnds out what software you have loaded
before you logged in. If you have the
latest version of the extra software the
system lets you straight through. If you
have not got anything soft loaded (loaded
from tape or disc) then Compu net sends
you the software you need. This is called
linking and takes a  little while. The
process is a little slower than using a 1541
disc drive and so, although disc users
decide to save on the cost of the tele-
phone call, tape users may decide to link
every time they log in rather than wait for
cassette tape to load. If the extra software
has been updated since you last saved it
the system will send you an update.
Because the mainframe always knows
what system you are using (a Commodore
64) it can send you routines and expect
you to be able to run them. It would be
possible for you to have a program which
shares the work between the mainframe
and the micro. This would speed up any

games which involved player to player
interaction. The mainframe could just
send a code and the software in the micro
would translate it into a sequence of
movements. This is looking to the future;
there is a fair bit on Compunet as it is.
The Jungle i s  ﬁn e  f o r  posting
announcements, b u t  y ou may  want
to send a private message to a few friends.
For this there is the Courier service. This
allows you to send the same information
to up to ﬁve people. When one of them
logs in a small letter box appears on the
title page to tell them that there is mail
waiting. The ﬁrst page of the letter shows
the recipient who else has had the same
letter. No charge has yet been announced
but this is likely to be an inexpensive
service.
Fun and games
Besides all the boring betting, home
banking and estate agent services which
make the database proﬁtable for  the
owners, there is Compucat, a database of
rumour and gossip which is run by a
computer freak who seems to know some
very important people.
Compucat is not to be confused with
Comp-U-Card, a  dis c ount or der ing
scheme which allows you to buy over the
modem w ith a  reasonable discount.
Because Comp-U-Card r equir es  a
scrolling screen the system has to send
you some special software, called a link,
which supplements t h e  C o m p u  net
software.
A similar link is used for the systems
adventure game. This is MUD: standing
for Multi-User Dungeon, it is the best
lor
adventure game written. The vocabulary
is much better than that of the Hobbit
and t h e  lexical analysis allows  f o r
commands like "Get it' and "Kill Him".
There are three types of objects: items
like the crown and swords which can
be c arried, mobiles  — c omputer
generated as s ailants  w h i c h  c a n
be fought and may be carrying treasure
which can be added to your haul and,
thirdly, real people. Other players enter
the same fantasy land: you can follow, talk
to, ﬁght with or  even kiss the other
players. MUD is huge; some people get
really addicted to it, living as an enchanter
or Necromancer is much more fun than
being a computer programmer. There are
so many  facets t o  M U D  that i t  is
impossible t o  cover them in any one
article; the best way to ﬁnd out about it is
to play it. Good luck.

IN THE FOLLOWING SERIES, I
hope to be able to give you an
insight into creating your own
fast, impressive a n d  w e l l
packaged action games. The
series contains four parts, the
ﬁrst three of which will contain
ideas, examples a n d  s ub-
routines.
Part one deals with the
foreground probably the most
important part of any action
game. This emcompasses the
objects which are t o  move.
acting out (1) instructions from
you (the good guy); (2) your
indirect instructions (eg. your
laser bolt, or (3) the computer's
logic (the bad guys).
The ﬁrst thing to consider
concerning the foreground is
tactics and, more especially,
their limitations. It is very easy
to make a game where you

make it more fun. There are
two ways to make a game more
challenging: you can make the
enemy m o r e  intelligent o r
vicious, or you can limit your
own movement/weaponry.
The second choice is better in
this case as it speeds up the
game. Intelligence, or enemy
weaponary, takes up plenty of
processing time and would
turn a BASIC game into a slow
joke. O nc e this foreground
format is decided, you can start
on the background (which part
two will cover).
Now the format is decided,
you have to implement it. It is
up to you how you do this, but
to help speed things up, I have

included some machine code
subroutines. An explanation of
each one follows. Note that the
ﬁrst listing gives a general way
to POKE the machine code to
memory. You can put as many
routines as  y ou want in t o
memory, in any order, and at
any sensible location with the
following limitations : e a c h
routine is no more than 256
bytes long so it is easier if all the
reset before using the routines.
Routine one: on using this
routine via SYS (routine start),
every sprite that you want to
move w ill b e  moved by  a
predetermined amount in  X
and/or Y  directions. T h e
routine is very quick, as you can
POKE in values before the main
part of the game starts, as well
as during it. POKE registers as
below:
POKE 52992+(sprite no.) x 2 ,  X increment
POKE 52993+(sprite no.) x 2 ,  X add(0) or subtract (1)
POKE 53008+(sprite no.) x 2 ,  Y increment

by PEEKing 780 directly using
this routine, the number o f
collisions detected w i l l  b e
given. This is a very quick way
of telling i f  a  collision has
occurred during that go. The
last register that you need to
know about is 53024, which
controls the proximity of the
collision i  how c los e t h e
objects' centres have to be for a
collision). When POKEing a
value here, zero gives a range
of two pixels: one gives four
pixels, two gives eight pixels
etc.
If I have not explained this
clearly enough, listing 2 gives
examples of how to use each
routine.

D y n a m i c  in its execution
The world you are about to enter bears no resemblance to any arena you ever
encountered before. Weapons are of no avail in this small habitat.
The only sources of protection at your disposal are quick wits and fast reﬂexes.
The only reward is to survive against monsters of unbelievable ferocity and
cunning, and to avoid hazards more perilous and deadly than any you might ﬁnd
on a trip through the outer universe. This is the real world, populated by the
creatures of our own inner universe, where nature is red in tooth and claw. Brace
yourself now, and come with Starcade into the still water and deceptive calm of
the SAVAGE POND.

status register are the MASTERING
Branching and the
subjects of this
month's installment of
our machine code
series from A.P. and
D.J. Stephenson.
MACHINE CODE
WHEN PROGRAMMING I N
BASIC, the IF/THEN statement
provides a n  eas y  w a y  o f
introducing a  decision. The
conditions c a n  b e  q u i t e
complex, such as
100 IF A -- 31fral+D) OR C 0
THEN PRINT "WRO NG ":
GOTO 350
Alas, it is not so easy in machine
code. I n the ﬁrst place, the
decision options are known as
branch instructions and there
are only eight to choose from
as can be seen from Table 4.1.
As usual, xx is used to indicate
the operand is one byte long
and can be speciﬁed by two
hex digits.

What does it mean when, to
example, we write BNE? We
can see from the table above
that it  means 'branch if  not
equal' but it immediately poses
the question —  branch i f
WHAT is not equal? The answer
to this is -  if the Z bit in the
process status register is 0. It
would help you at this point if
you turn back to Part 2 of this
series where y ou w ill ﬁnd
details o f  t he ﬂags i n  this
register and t h e  conditions
under which they are set tol or
cleared to O. You will see that
an appropriate ﬂag is updated
automatically after most of the
instructions. So, still referring
to BNE as an example, the
branch will take place only if
the last instruction caused a
non-zero result. That is to say,
the mic r opr oc es s or  w i l l
examine its process register to
see if the Z bit was a O. The
opposite instruction, BEQ can
=

P r o g r a m m i n g
be used to test if the last result
was zero —the branch will now
take place if the Z bit is 1.
Another paid o f  branch
instructions is BPL and BMI_ A
branch takes place with BMI
only if the N bit is 1. You will
remember from Part 1 of the
series that single byte negative
numbers in two complement
notation always have a 1 in the
msb pos ition b u t  pos itiv e
numbers always have a zero.
So, if you are working in twos
complement (but y ou won't
always be), you can use either
BPL or BMI as appropriate, to
test the sign of the last result. It
is worth mentioning here that
these two instructions may not
be used as frequently as the
other branch instructions.
BCS and BCC are another
pair of opposites. These are
used to test if the last operation
caused a result which was 'too
big' to be handled by a single
byte, so forcing a 'carry out'.
This carry bit is captured in the
C bit position o f  the status
register. With BCS, a branch
takes place only if the C bit is 1.
With BCC, a branch takes place
only if the C bit is O.
The ﬁnal pair of opposites
are BVC and BVS. A branch
takes place with BVS only if the
V bit is 1. In other words, you
can test if the last result caused
two's complement overﬂow
because, if it did, the V bit is set
to 1 .  H o w e v e r ,  ' t w o ' s
complement overﬂow' mus t
not be confused with the carry-
out c ondition mentioned
earlier_ Indeed, it is possible for
the overﬂow condition to exist
without a carry out occurring
and vice versa. I n  case this
seems strange to you, consider
what happens if we add 1 to
+127 i n  two's  complement
binary:
+127
add 1
result
0111 11111
1
It we treat the result (128 in
decimal) as  a  pur e binary
absolute number, it  is  ﬂuke
sensible. If, on the other hand,
we interpret the result in two's
complement, i t  i s  c learly
absurd because 1000 0000 is
-128. Although there has been
no carry out, a n  overﬂow
condition is established which
would set the V bit to 1. The
larges t p o s i t i v e  t w o ' s
complement number  whic h
can be held in a single byte is
127 so, if we try to add 1, we
must expect the result to be
invalid — overﬂow in fact. This
is a tricky business so it is worth
one more example:

should be zero, as indeed the

ther efor e n o  o v e r ﬂo w
condition and yet there is a
carry out — which is ignored!
So, the V bit would show a 0 but
the C bit would show a 1 after
this example. T his  s hould
illustrate t h e  point w e  are
trying to make; it is the way we
interpret the arithmetic that
determines whether we ignore
the C bit or the V bit. It must be
ﬁrmly established in your mind
that 'overﬂow' is a condition
which only makes sense if you
are conducting arithmetic in
two's complement form. If you
are work ing w it h  absolute
numbers only (all positive) the
t oncept o f  ov er ﬂow, a s
signalled by the V bit, has no
meaning. Later in the series,
when we deal with peripheral
controls, we shall learn that the
V bit is employed in another
role, q u i t e  unr elated t o
overﬂow.
Calculating branch
operands
We have, in the preceeding
paragraph, frequently men -
tioned that the branch takes
place if — etc etc'. The next
topic of discussion is how we
work out the branch destina-
tion. In BASIC, of course, we
just say GOTO followed by a
line number. We can't do this
in machine code because the
concept of line numbers does
not exist. (Even if we had an
assembler ﬁtted, w e  s t ill
couldn't use a line number as a
branch des tination.)  T h e
operand in a branch instruc-
tion is a number which, if the
condition is true, informs the
microprocessor h o w  many
bytes forward (or backward)
the next instruction is to be
found. This is called relative
addressing because it indicates
a destination address relative to
the present address. Only the
eight branch instructions use
relative addressing.
To understand this mode of
addressing, we should be clear
in our minds as to the role of
the most important register in
the mic r opr oc es s or , t h e
Program Counter (PC). This is a
16-bit register which always
contains the absolute address
of the NEXT instruction byte to
be executed, As you already
know, a  m a c h in e  c o d e
program is simply a set of bytes,
stored in memory in sequential
addresses. Suppos e thes e
program bytes are stored in a
block f r o m  address $C000
(49152 decimal) onwards. To
execute the program, we can
simply enter SYS 49152 and
press RETURN. This will cause
the hex equivalent of 49152 to
be loaded into the program
counter. T h e  sequence o f
events i s  t h e n  e n t ir e ly
automatic: the instruction byte
at address 49152 is brought into
the mic r opr oc es s or  a n d
processed, after whic h t h e
program counter goes up 1 and
the nex t sequential by te is
processed and so on. However,
if a  branc h instruction i s
encountered and conditions
are true, the operand byte of
the instruction is added to the
present c ontents  o f  t h e
program counter. The smooth
sequential ac tion i s  n o w
replaced by a sudden jump to a
new instruction byte address.
Once t he new address has
been reached, the program
counter proceeds in orderly
sequential fashion from that
new address. An example will
help:
1. As s ume t h e  pr ogr am
contains a set of bytes located
from address $C000 onwards.
2. N o w  assume the program
has reached the second byte of
the instruction BNE $07 located
at address $C011. The program
counter w i l l  t h e n  c ontain
$C012 — the next instruction
byte address.

taken, the operand ($07) will
then be added to the program
counter w h ic h  w i l l  t h e n

instruction byte to be executed
will then be taken from this
address — seven bytes forward.
If the branch conditions were
not true, the program counter
would not be altered and the
next instruction byte at $C012
would be executed.

Calculating backward
branches
As y o u  a r e  awar e w h e n
programming i n  BASI C ,
GOTOs can be to higher or
lower line numbers. How do
we calculate t h e  operand
number if we wish to branch
backwards? The answer is that
we resort to two's complement
arithmetic. Relative addressing
can b e  used w ith negative
numbers in  the operand t o
indicate a branch back to an
38 ear lier  address. For example, if
we wish t o  branch 7  bytes
backwards, we must have an
operand of -7. This is where
our previous knowledge o f
tvvo's complement arithmetic is
brought i n t o  us e. I f  y o u

the program counter. Figure

It should be realised, from
previous discussions on two's

maximum number of forward
bytes which can be used with
any b ra n ch  i s  127 a n d  t h e

This is because the operand of a
branch instruction can only be
one byte long.
Fortunately, i t  i s  v e r y

ming t o  r equir e branches
greater than these allowed
limits. However, as we shall see
later, t h e r e  i s  a  w a y  o f
overcoming t h e  pr oblem,
should it ever arise.
Mistakes in machine code
programs can often be traced
to incorrect branch operands
because it is so easy to be one
out in the byte count. Another
pitfall is the status register ﬂags.
When a branch instruction is
encountered, the current state
of the ﬂags determine whether
or not the branch takes place.
Normally, but not always, it is
the effect of the last instruction
which i s  b e i n g  t e s t e d .
However, some instructions do
not effect the status ﬂags, in
which c as e, t h e  t e s t  i s
d e p e n d e n t  o n  e a r l i e r
conditions.
The following instructions
have no effect on the status
ﬂags: STA, STX, PHA, PHP, TXS
and all the branch instructions.
The f a c t  t h a t  b r a n c h
instructions have no effect on
status ﬂags means that branch
instructions c an follow one
another in order to test for two
different conditions.
The status ﬂags effected
depend on the instruction so it
is important to be familiar with
Table 4.2, showing which of the
status ﬂags are affected.

many of the above instructions

the table will be helpful to refer

that there is little point in using

only the N  and Z  ﬂags are
effected by DR. If the carry
was 0, it would have been due
to the effects o f  an earlier
instruction.
Branching w h e n  a n
assembler is ﬁtted
Calculating t h e  number o f
bytes in  t he operand o f  a
branch instruction is fraught
with danger. It is so easy to get
it wrong, particularly w it h
backward branches. I f  t h e
count is out by one, it is highly
probable t h e  program w ill
crash because t h e  branc h
destination c o u ld  b e  t h e
operand instead o f  the op-
code of an instruction. If by
chance, the operand happens
to be a legitimate op-code, the
microprocessor will treat it as
such and execute it! If, on the
other h a n d ,  i t  d o e s n ' t
recognise i t ,  t h e  program
would crash.
One o f  the most useful
aspects of an assembler is the
way it allows us to write branch
instructions. I n s t e a d  o f
counting the bytes, we can use
a label of our choice. Using the
MIKRO assembler, but using
xx to represent example bytes,
a b r a n c h  w o u l d  l o o k
something like:
xx
xx

VOLTS x x

etc
BNE VOLTS
The operand lable i n  t h e
branch has been chosen as
VOLTS. T he assembler w ill
search down the program until
it ﬁnds a line beginning with
VOLTS. N o t e  t h a t  t h e
assembler demands that the
destination label ends with a
space. As an excercise, satisfy
yourself t hat, w ithout a n
assembler, the above branch
instruction i n  hex  machine
code would be, DO 07. The op-
code for BNE is DO and the
branch is 7 bytes forward n o t

status register
When we discussed the status
register bits in connection with
branch instructions, i t  was
established that the relevant
bits are automatically updated
by the microprocessor after
each instruction. However,
there ar e certain situations
where it is necessary for the
programmer to intervene and
manually alter the bits. The
seven instructions available for
this purpose ar e shown i n

It is a trivial 'program' and it is
not expected that you try and
run it. It starts by loading 06
into the accumulator, using
immediate addressing. This will
make t he Z  bit=0. I t  then
branches to the line labelled
JOE. It must do, of course, since
the accumulator is  certainly
not z ero. T he accumulator
contents are then stored in the
absolute address $C401. The
computer then reaches BRK
(which means BReak and is
roughly equivalent to END in
BASIC). If the ﬁrst line of the
program was changed so that
the accumulator was initially
loaded with 00, the branch
would not be taken and the
accumulator contents would
then be stored in $C400 before
reaching BRK. So, depending
on the state of the accumu-
lator, the program will either
stop in the middle or at the
end. Examine the hex code
version carefully, particularly
the branch operand — satisfy
yourself that this is correct.
Note also that the op-code for
BRK is 00. You will no doubt
agree t h a t  t h e  assembler
version is  easier and mor e
informative.
Note we r an , el or r lear t he C
bit, or dear the V bit. We shall
not attempt, at this stage, to
discuss the conditions under
which t hes e ins tr uc tions
should be used. Neither would
it b e  proﬁtable t o  discuss
interrupt masks or D bits. For
the moment, treat Table 4.3 as
reference ma t e ria l t o  b e
consulted later.
Comparison
instructions
There are times when a simple
branch test is not quite what we
want. For example, BEQ and
BNE can only test for zero or
non-zero. What if we want to
ﬁnd out if a register contains
some particular number, 7
perhaps? O n e  w a y  w hic h
comes to mind is to subtract 7
from t h e  number  i n  t h e
register and then use BNE or
BEQ to see if the result is zero.
Obviously, if X--7=0then X must
contain 7. Unfortunately, the
subtraction operation destroys
the number originally in the
register and we may not want
this — it would be destructive
testing. We could, of course.
save t h e  register contents
somewhere before the test and
re-load again afterwards but
this, to say the least, would be
cumbersome. Fortunately.
there a r e  t h r e e  beautiful
comparison in s t r u c t io n s
available which perform the
subtraction for you but without
hurting the register you are
testing. It is called 'transparent'
subtraction. We shall describe
the action of CMP ﬁrst and,
because it  is  the easiest t o
understand. use the immediate
addressing mode for example
purposes.
Suppose w e  wr ite C MP
$07. This will compare the
hex number  0 7  w it h  t h e
number in the accumulator (A)
and update the Z,N and C bits
according t o  t h e  following
rules:
1. I f  operand number ($07 in
this case) = number in register,
Z and C become 1
2. I f  operand number is less
than number in  register, C
becomes 1 and Z becomes 0
3. I f  operand number  i s
greater t h a n  n u m b e r  i n
register. C and 7 become 0
4. I f  operand number is less
than o r  equal t o  number in
register, C becomes 1. It should
be clearly understood that a
compare ins tr uc tion o n l y
effects the status ﬂags. It does
nothing else. Therefore, the
only possible instruction after
CMP is a suitable branch test.
Unless y o u  us e a  branch
immediately afterwards, there
is no point in using CMP in the
ﬁrst place.
Although w e  have used
immediate addressing in our
example, a  w id e  range o f
addressing modes are possible.
Thus, w e  can compare the
contents o f  a  par tic ular
memory address. T h e  f u ll
range of comparison instruct-
ions are shown in Table 4.4.

guidance on how to keep
your cool when lost h a l l
maze.
" M t

LAST MONTH WE LOOKED AT MOVING
into adventure games, with how to map
what we ﬁnd. This is a really vital part of
adventure gaming — unless you are one of
those people with eidetic (photographic)
memory.
To recap, look at ﬁgure 1. This is the
sort of map you would expect to have
after exploring the ﬁrst few locations of a
new game. Each box represents a discrete
location and the lines between them
show how these are linked together.
Arrows signify the direction you may take
to reach the location. Only one arrow
would mean movement i n  only  one
direction and the cross-bars indicate that
no exit (at the moment!) exists in that
direction. The loop to the east of the
'steep river bank shows that i f  y ou
continue going east from this location —
you end up at the same position! This
technique is often used at the 'edge' of
an adventure's known world.
Each box is labelled so that you will be
able t o  relate it's  position t o  t h e
description seen on the screen. Items
found — and if not obvious how found —
are also recorded.
All this  is  fairly  straightforward,
providing you have a large enough piece
of paper  a n d  k eep y our  head —
sometimes literally! Now look at ﬁgure 2.
Ouch, what a mess. One slip of the pencil
and y ou c ould land yourself in  real.
trouble! What's worse, nearly all the
paths are one way only. AND, what if all
four locations had the same description (I
have labelled them ABCD just for the
purpose of this article!)?
Just amazing
As you've surely guessed, you are in a
form o f  maze. Directions n o  longer
necessarily f o llo w  t h e  lo g ic  us ed
elsewhere in  t he game. Going west,
having just moved east, is not likely to get
back to where you started! Figure 2 shows
a four location maze but rarely will you
ﬁnd one with so few 'rooms'. You can
often ﬁnd your way out by just hitting the
direction keys at random, but this is
seldom the whole story and is unlikely to
help you solve the adventure. Either you
have wasted a number of valuable turns
during whic h y our food o r  lamp is
running out — and of course the program
is structured so that it is then impossible to
reach mor e food/oil etc. O r  hidden
C 4 4 somewhere in the heart of the maze,
is something vital to your wellbeing or
vital to a successful conclusion in the
future!
You have got to face up to the problem of
mapping the maze. Mazes seem to be an
accepted part of most adventure games.

Figure
up to wherever you have reached at that
time. Adventure games are very rarely
written with the intention of a player
sitting down and solving them in one
sitting! They are meant to provide you
with days o r  weeks o f  playing time
before you reach a solution.
So use the SAVE facility fairly often —
do not overwrite a previous SAVE all the
time, otherwise you may ﬁnd that the
objects you now hold are the objects
you need — one of those previous SAVEs
may save you a lot of time! Using this form
of recursive approach is not cheating, it is
part of the system by which you learn your
way around.
Right y o u  may ﬁnd yourself in a
maze — so QUIP ReLOAD your last SAVE
and approach the maze carefully! Make
sure you are carrying as many objects as
the game permits — now when you enter
the maze, drop something at location 'A'
Some people would say that they are
unnecessary as they tend to be similar
puizies. But as  t he cunning o f  the
programmer grows, so too does the type
of maze they produce and we the players
have got to look for clues to pinpoint what
varient we are being called to solve!
The 'original' type of maze is not so
difﬁcult t o  overcome and t h e  basic
procedure used to solve it, may well form
the core of how you approach its many
varients. Firstly, you must use a different
form of 'mapping', something like ﬁgure
2 would produce a  very messy and
unreliable map of the area altogether.
Obviously you will not always know in
advance that you are about to enter a
maze! S o  this  immediately hammers
home t h e  need t o  mak e frequent
SAVEings of your progress. Nearly all of
the better adventure games include the
facility to SAVE your character's position

A d v e n t u r e

Figure 2
well just use ﬁg 2 as our maze) say 'a
staff'. Instead of following our previous
mapping technique we'll draw a separate,
and unconnected, box for each location.
Although the descriptions are the
same, location 'A' will also have 'a staff'
lying around! Move in any direction — if
you moved south y ou will return t o
location 'A' ...and will see the staff, but if
you go east you will come to another
seemingly identical place — but without
the staff! So drop something else 
a
cup. East now, and you are back to the
cup, west, and yet another location
drop some keys. North l o  and behold,
back to where you dropped the staff.
B C
To be sure you have mapped the maze
you must try every possible direction
from each location. Having done this you
will end up with a map like that in ﬁgure 3.
You must try every direction; program-
mers are quite devious enough to make
the only acceptable 'NW' move in the
whole game, the way out of the maze to
somewhere vital!
To solve a maze such as this you must
be able to carry enough objects to drop in
the various locations! If you think about it,
you will realise that it is possible to solve
a maLe with one less object than there are
locations. If only one place does not have
something extra, then it is still unique —
mind you, this is a pretty dirty trick and
certainly gets the adrenalin pumping,
until you realise what is happening!
Once you have mapped your maze,
you can either retrace your steps and pick
everything u p  or  QUIT, reLOAD and
travel through carrying your precious
(you hope) artifacts with you — just don't
forget where you are!
Although t h is  k in d  o f  maz e i s
disappearing in favour of more complex
nasties — it still points the way to how to
solve most if not all mazes. You have got
to ﬁnd a way to uniquely deﬁne each
location.

Sometimes the solution t o  a maze is
staring you in the face — literally. Read
the descriptions o f  all locations very
carefully. "You are on a raft in a storm
swept sea there are sharks all around you"
looks very similar to "You are on a raft in a
storm swept sea, there are sharks all
around you". It is easy enough to spot the
difference on this printed page but when
those t w o  descriptions f ollow  o n e
another on your screen — will you always
notice the extra comma? Or a space, or a
full stop at the end of one of them?
Perhaps your maze is a mixture of the
Iwo above types — ouch? Just keep your
cool and hope that there is a logical
solution. "You are on a path in a forest",
"You are on a path in a forest", "You are
on a path in a forest" — how about
EXAMINE TREES or EXAMINE PATH —
you may well ﬁnd a clue at one or all
locations!
Another devious one is  for  y our
location t o  alter something y ou are
already carrying — perhaps your sword
tarnishes o r that magic mirro r you have
been holding onto, wondering what use it
is s h o w i n g  different reﬂections as you
move around the maze?!
The ploys and puzzles within mazes
have by no means been wrung dry and a
well wrought, logical adventure maze can
still give tremendous satisfaction...when
solved!
Thorny subject
Much has been written about tape copy
programs. We all know that one of their
primary uses is t o cheat the software
houses out of their rightful dues. All of
them warn about this usage — but still,
thousands of people "just make a copy for
a friend"!
It is of course nearly impossible to
stop. Software houses can tackle the
problem in three ways: (1) endeavour to
make their programs 'uncopyable' (2)
the bother or (3) increase the price to
make up for losses,
If you want a good product it is almost
certain that it  was costly to produce.
Often, teams o f  programmers hav e
worked on different aspects — music,
graphics, etc — for months.
Figurt 3
Having said my piece, let us look at the
other side of the coin: (1) it is useful to
have y our  own back-up, i n  case o f
catastrophe a n d  ( 2)  although many
adventure games are now on 'Turbo Load'
(and it's many variants), some take a long
time to LOAD...
I recently got a  copy o f  HYPER-
SAVE 6 4  f o r  m y  C BM 6 4  —  pr o-
duced by  DOSOFT of Blackpool. This
utility enables a Hyperspeed copy of a
standard LOAD cassette to be made. Not
all tapes will be accepted but I would
certainly recommend having one to hand,
on the off chance! Impatient that's  me!

reviewers guide you
through another
jungle of Commodore
software.
QUESTION: COULD YOU BE
responsible for the fall of the
House of Usher? Answer: quite
simply, yes. But it  will take
some doing. It's not that there's
anything desperately new to
get u s e d  t o  o r ,  indeed,
anything desperately difﬁcult
about it. No, it's just that there
is a lot to get through. The
concept of the game, however.
is relatively nov el although
perhaps a little disappointing in
terms of excitement value. But
on with the game. The warped
and t w i s t e d  m i n d s  o f
generations o f  mad Ushers
have devised a  variety o f
tormenting challenges. O n
entering the ancestral home
you are given a choice of nine
rooms to enter in each of which
there is a game to play. As stand
alone games go it's fair to say
that they are not up to much.
Sufﬁce to say, although they
are all different, there is a touch
of the 'donkey kongs' about
them all. However, taken as a
w hole t h e y  a r e  q u i t e
challenging because you have
to successfully negotiate them
all before you are allowed to
enter a further two rooms to
complete the game. Whether
you liv e  lo n g  enough t o
mastermind t h e  Fall o f  t he
House o f  Usher is  another
matter though.

I HIS IS A BOOKLET/CASSETTE
educational package whic h
deals with sundry aspects of
road transport.
The booklet starts with a
brief history of roads starting
with the Ridgeway, a possible
stone-age r o a d ,  t h r o u g h
Roman roads and Macadam to
modern motorways. The next
part o f  t h e  book let deals
succinctly with the workings of
a car. Further sections deal with
petrol consumption and the
layout of roads in Britain. An
interesting div ers ion f r om
technicalities is a short extract
from the "Wind in the willows"
(Toad rather enjoys motoring...
if you didn't know), a footnote
suggesting that the child reads
the rest of the book. Finally
there are several games to play
on the theme of car journeys.
The book let i s  v er y  w e ll
thought out and presented.
The program supplied in
the package endeavours to put
into practice what has been
learnt in the booklet. You play
the role of a delivery man and
must make money from your
service b y  using y our van,
petrol and the routes available
efﬁciently. Calculations have to
be made throughout the game.
The graphics are simple but
effective and can be used in
further exercises suggested in
the booklet as well as the main
routine.
Overall t h e  p r o g r a m
appeared to be the weakest
the trouble spot. To transport you around
the attack zone at speed, a helicopter has
been placed at your disposal. You also
have a police car and a boat to use in
uncovering the roads and the rivers in the
area. You transfer from one to another
simply by pressing the allocated function
keys. You can use the helicopter t o
transport both The car and the -
other parts of the attack zone. Points are
scored for uncovering the roads, rivers
and the attack locations and points are
lost for going in the wrong direction or
not moving at all. But watch your fuel
levels closely. Fuel can be transferred to
section o f  the package, but
used as a whole would serve as
a g o o d  a d d it io n  t o  any
classroom.
M.E.W.
the boat and the car from the helicopter
when it runs out but the helicopter must
take on more fuel from the fuel dump
before it crashes. The helicopter has three
'lives'. All locations under attack are
revealed by a shell burst and you must
rush to them immediately. When you get
there the screen changes to show the
area in more detail. Silhouettes of the
terrorists will appear but you must get in
the ﬁrst shot. At the end of the battle the
casualties are counted and the location
declared either safe or in the enemy's
hands. So do your good deed for the day.
A great game.

computer game and a good
one into the bargain. Bristles
has a four player option and
gives each player the choice of
playing two painters. And that's
the object of the game...simply
to paint all the rooms in a
variety of houses as quickly as
possible. There are six skill
levels to progress through and
eight houses in each skill level,
so it's not exactly an easy task.
It's not just a high score you're
after either. On each skill level
there is  a  hidden message
which will appear in part after
every house you complete the
painting contract o n .  T he
ultimate c hallenge i s  t o
discover a ll t h e  messages.
What, no obstacles? Well not
quite. In fact there are quite a
few. Each player starts the game
with ten paint brushes and gets
an extra two for each house
painted but also loses one for
each mistake made. There are
lifts to help you get from ﬂoor
to ﬂoor but unless you time it
right they will splatter you into
the basement. There are also

again, unless vou are quick, the
the lifts will splatter you. But
the major obstacles are the
ﬂying half pints of paint which
you have to jump over or duck
under and the dumb buckets.
The bucket chucker is highly
intelligent and will chase you
from room t o  room. And
there's more. Brenda the Brat is

her is by giving her a sweetie.

and the Ghoul.
Your man, who resembles
a distant relative of a Pacman

THIS GAME HAVING BEEN A
great success on the Spectrum
has now been converted for
the 64. A t  the time o f  it's
original release, ther e was
great acclaim for the unusual
use of the 3D effects. To my
mind the effects on the 64 are
also very good albeit not quite
as impressive as the Spectrum
version.
Notwithstanding the absurd
spiel on the cassette inlay, the
plot is tolerably simple. You
control a  small ﬁgure and
attempt to locate unfortunates
scattered about the deserted
city o f  Antes c her . T h e
buildings o f  t h e  c it y  a r e
represented as blocks and you
get a nice perspective view of
part of the city. As you move
about, t h e  s c ene s c r olls
diagonally showing more o f
the area. By pressing any of the
function buttons, y ou c an
choose any one of four views of
the area. The main problem is
that the city is occupied with
large quantities of giant ants
which have this irritating habit
of killing our hero. To evade
digesting this  appetiser t he
Ghoul, w h o  is  slowly des-
cending o n  y ou, disappears
for a few seconds allowing you
to c o n t i n u e  y o u r  t a s k
unhampered.
If you do die, and I can
assure you it's very likely, the
Ghoul will grin with pleasure.
But y ou s oon ret urn to try and
complete the level and move
on to harder screens. When
your little Pacman completes
the fourth and ﬁnal screen the
Ghoul disintegrates befor e
your eyes and P'acman jumps
up and down.
The game also contains a
facility to turn sound off, which
includes all the sound effects.
It's a very fast game as you have
a time limit to complete each
screen in. There is a high-score
table and a pause button as well
as the fast loading system!
'
def  h, you can either try to out
run them, climb up a building
or throw one of your limited
supply of grenades.
When you encounter one
of the lost souls, they make a
suitably banal comment and, if
you don't run too fast, follow
you to  safety. You must be
careful, however, to  protect
both yourself and the rescued
victim.
The graphics are superbly
simple comprising o f  grey
blocks with different shades of
grey to give perspective. The
movement of the little man is
accurate in as much that you
can climb over, through and
around t h e  buildings. T he
animation o f  a ll ﬁgures is
superb. The use of sound, on
the other hand, was weak.
Overall, whilst the visua
effect is faultless, I found the
play rather boring. After the
ﬁrst half hour, I found myself
dearly wishing that something
new would happen.

This is a copy of a game called Shamus in

THIS IS A N  EDUCATIONAL
game w it h  a  difference. I t
comes as a package of cassette
and booklet. The booklet deals
with real-life spies and those
from ﬁction. After  reading
about spies, the reader is given
activities to try, either writing a
spy story o r  doing further
research. To be a successful stoy
you will need to understand
about codes a n d  s py  kits.
Similarly, a  good grasp o f
Europe a n d  it ' s  c ities  i s
necessary. The booklet gives
information about a ll these
aspects and suggests extra
activities. Hav ing done t h e
background wor k  fr om t he
booklet, the game puts theory
into practice.
Your aim in the game is to
capture an enemy agent who is
travelling about Europe killing
off your resident agents. You
have secondary aims in that
you try to operate as fast as
possible and t o  k eep costs
down. Fail t o  keep t o  your
game, Spinners, Clones, Cyberdroids and
a ghost of a player past. The difference
between this one and other copies is the
task you have to perform.
In this game the player is told what
treasure has to be retrieved and put in the
safe. On the ﬁrst level it is one treasure, on
the next it is two and so on. I must point
out that just before you enter a level there
is this superb sound effect. It only lasts for
a second or so but it's great. Anyway,
there are 16 rooms on each level t o
explore while looking for the treasure, an
indicator in the top right-hand corner
budget and to operate speedily
and y ou w ill end u p  pen-
pushing behind a  desk. A
highly unworthy end f or  a
secret agent!
During t h e  game y our
agents will send intelligence
reports giving clues as to the
whereabouts o f  the enemy.
Some of these reports have the
added difﬁculty o f  being in
code. You can get help from
headquarters to de-code the
message b u t  i t  costs extra
money, as do messages from
informants. When y ou think
you know where the enemy is,
you can dial up a time table of
ﬂights and trains out of town
and t o  other cities, You can
then travel to a city where you
think h e  is  and, with luck,
capture him,
This is a very good package
in that it brings together all
aspects o f education. These
include geography, history, the
need t o  perform simple
decoding and even the ability
to use the 24 hour clock.
In all, this is an excellent
package which can be used as a
fun way to spend time at home,
or can be usefully expanded to
a project for use at school.

are on.
I mentioned earlier the existence of a
ghost. He cannot be killed but he can be
stunned. Obviously as you travel through
each level the spirit, when stunned, isn't
stationary for a long a period_ The game
has reasonable graphics with good sound
accompaniment. It has a pause facility and
a high score table. I would have preferred
the treasures and the safe in a different
colour as they are occassionally hard to
ﬁnd.

YOU H AVE G AINED T H E
upper hand in the war with
your deadly enemy and i t
seems to be your VTOL that has
done the trick. But now the
enemy is about to launch a last
ditch attack to win the war and
it is up to you to prevent them
from succeeding. F o r  t h e
battle, your VTOL has been
armed with both air-to-air and
a ir - t o - g r o u n d  mis s iles .
Although your VTOL is nippy
and highly manoeuvreable, it
requires careful handling. You

slow down ﬁrst. And the enemy
is n o  p u s h o v e r  e i t h e r .
Although they have no VTOLs,
THIS GAME OFFERS TWO GAMES OF
different but unexceptional styles. The
ﬁrst game involves pseudo 3D movement
effects to simulate the view forward from
the cockpit of a spaceship. The idea of the
game is to shoot approaching nasties
before they reach you. You have a cross-
hair sight to assist your aim. The graphics
and use of colour were very nice but the
actual action was appallingly unexciting.
The second game is a maze type and,
much to my surprise, was worse than part
one. You control a robot and must move
about a  maze endeavouring t o  catch
rampant ROMs (Read Only Memories).
Your movement is impeded by patrolling
resistors and RAM chips. If you get into
trouble you can disable the opposition
but you loose 5000 points. Since scoring
was low, I didn't have this option available
very often. Graphically this segment was
only just average.
Overall, !found this package weak and
really not any better than average.

accompanying booklet..."Ballooning is
an accurate simulation o f  a  h o t  air
balloon". In fact it was so accurate that the
ascent took so long that it was very easy to
fall asleep, thus missing the whole point of
the game (you should be observing the
dials giving your altitude and fuel etc.).
You start off at ﬂying school learning how
to ﬂy and land your balloon. Following
this, when you think you are ready, you
take your ﬂying test and hopefully gain
your wings. Should you wish to do a little
extra work, you can keep a record of your
altitude during your ﬂights and try to
make a  duplicate ﬂight. The booklet
accompanying t h e  cassette suggests
alternative games which you can play
using the package.
The booklet covers many aspects of
balloons and ballooning starting with
their history through t o  the scientiﬁc
principles of their ﬂight. Suggestions for
further research are provided so that the
topic can be stretched as far as you want.
An important aspect of ﬂying is the ability
to read maps and estimate the effects of
wind. Again this aspect is discussed in the
booklet.
The display gives a side view of your
balloon moving act:oss the terrain. Along
the bottom of the screen are instrument
dials showing altitude, rate of climb, fuel
and temperature. Overall a reasonable
package although the program seemed a
little slow and tedious.
M.E.W.
the VTOL carries 100 missiles
but you are bound to need to
take on more weapons and fuel
during the course of the battle.
You do this by landing on the
strategically loc ated launc h
pads which remain serviceable
until 75% are destroyed. But
there are dangers in this. You
are vulnerable and the enemy
knows it. So beware otherwise
you'll never make it through
the 16 levels.

NO CONCESSIONS T O  THE FAINT-
hearted with this zapping game. It's
straight in at the deep end with the kind of
difﬁculty levels that killed video gaming as
a pub sport. No sooner had you put your
lop in the slot when the game was over.
There are ten or so different types of alien
craft to zap most of which are ﬁring at you
at the same time and all of which have a
different value in terms of points. Take the
ﬁrst screen for  example. It looks like
you're defending the pyramids and not
only do the aliens ﬂit across the screen
casually dropping tracers but there's one
that homes in on you as well. And, with
such a highly coloured background it's
hard to tell where anything is, let alone
avoid it. Ten straight forward hits, without
taking a shot yourself, pushes you into the
next screen where you have a quick
change into a more horizontal aspect
before moving back t o  screen one's
targets on an even more technicolour
background. What else can I say? Still
having played the game and written about
it, I can t quite make up my mind whether
it's good ro bad. One thing is for sure. It's
extremely irritating to play and lose so
quickly.

IF IT NEVER ACHIEVES ANYTHING ELSE,
this game must have one of the longest
titles in the market. From the instructions
the Strontium Dog is  really a mutant
called Johnny Alpha (does the author
read Harry Harrison?). Our hero is on the
trail o f  a couple of renegade mutants
called the Stix Brothers. The action takes
place on the Planet of the Renegades
where we ﬁnd Johnny shot down in no
man's land. Hence, our  man o f  the
moment must cross the planet shooting,
avoiding a wide range of nasties,
From the nature of the task, you won't
be surprised to hear that the game is of the
scrolling type. You are shown the side
view of the planet. This steadily scrolls
from right to left giving the appearance of
general movement to the right. Scattered
along the way are animated nasties, plants
and the occassiona I rock. Collision with
these has a nasty effect on our hero's
strength. Excessive depletion of his power
results in his demise. Occasionally rather
useful objects yield valuable points. You
can vary your speed across the planet, but
this rapidly depletes your strength. I f
trouble looms you can use electro-ﬂares

Meanwhile, at the bottom

shooting a n d  a n  w it h o u t

new game jumps  o n  t h e
Olympic bandwagon and does
it. very well. The program starts
with the opening ceremony.
The ﬂame is lit and doves are
set loose t o  ﬂy  across the

enter your name and choose
the country you represent. An
approximation to your national
anthem will be played if you
win. ( U p t o  8  players can

to either try a single event or
partake in all. If you wish you
can even practice any events
you choose.
In the diving you have four
dives and you can vary the dive
52 ( a n d  tarrif) b y  deft mani-
pulation of the joystick. Next is
the pole-vault which needs a
lot of dexterity and timing to
clear the bar. The next events
are the 400 metre relay and the
Microdeal are now into the
CBM 64 market. This program
continues the theme set on the
Dragon by featuring Cuthbert,
an overweight schoolboy with
a taste for adventure. As clearly
suggested b y  t he title, this
game is a graphical adventure
set in  a maze of interlinked
rooms. (I believe that there are
in excess of 200 of them!!)
During his travels, Cuthbert
must collect a  number  o f
things. First, keys are necessary
to open doors  barring his
route. There are lanterns, rings,
golden apples and urns which
yield points. All of these items
are found in niches in the walls.
Your travels are impeded in
a number of ways. There are
sundry nasties which appear in
the rooms and will k ill you
given a chance. You are, of
course, armed with a laser with
which the enemy can be shot.
The a i r  between doors  is
lim it e d  a n d  g r a d u a l l y
decreases with time. You must
therefore remember to unlock
doors regularly before air runs
out. There is one other method
of protection. T o  aid y our
movement t h r o u g h  s o m e
rooms, t h e r e  a r e  ma t t e r
transporters. You have three
coloured lamps which can be
used i n  r o o m s  o f  t h e
corresponding colour. I f  the
lamp is full, you can freeze the
enemy once. You must then
reﬁll t h e  la mp  b y  scoring
points. Filling a lamp also lights
up le t t e r s  i n  t h e  w o r d
CATACOMB written at the top
of the screen. When all of the
letters ar e l i t  u p ,  y ou get
another life.
Overall t h is  i s  a  w e ll
designed game with tasteful
graphics and a  jolly  rather
tedious sound track. Certain of
the rooms are designed so that
cunning and tactics must be
adopted to collect treasure or
open doors. As  with many
games, the actual system for
solution is ﬁxed and can be
resolved given time. You can,
however, vary many o f  the
game parameters to increase
the difﬁculty of the game. My
best is room 111 and that leaves
me feeling exhausted. In all, a
nice one.

100 metre dash. Both races are
against the clock as are the two
swimming races.
The gymnastics are great
fun especially as everytime I
tried a vault the gymnast either
landed on her face or rear end!
The most difﬁcult of all was the
skeet shoot, probably because
it was the most realistic. You
have to shoot either single or
double clays f r o m several
positions. The simulation was
most ac c ur ate a n d  e v e n
included the effects o f  shot
scatter.
The graphics in this game
are of a very high standard with
detailed h i g h  r es olut ion
backdrops and excellently
animated sprites. Overall this is
an excellent program and is
probably the best 'Olympic'
program available.
M.E.W.
CAN THIS BE TRUE? I'M SURE
it isn't — I think it is. Yes folks,
it's Galaxians t im e  again.
Swoop is yet another imitation
of that old game which people
just wont let go. The difference
between this one and others is
that if a Galaxian, sorry, Space
Vulture gets past you it lays an
explosive egg in  your path.
Which means if you touch it
you blow up or if you don't you
could b e  cornered and get
blown up anyway!
As y ou progress through
the levels the Galaxians, cops,
space v ultur es  g e t  more
ferocious and it does require a
lot o f  agility on the higher
levels. Yet again, the music on
this Micro-power offering is
outstanding a n d  a  nic e
graphics t o u c h  has  been
added. T h e  stars i n  the
background move at different
rates, giving an impression of
depth and when your craft
explodes the debris is scattered
in a wide arc.
The game has different skill
levels and a high score facility.
There is also a pause button. So
in all fairness it's not a bad copy
of Swoop, sorry, Galaxians!

KOALA PAD TOUCH TABLET
Koala Technologies C o r p -
oration
E79-95
Commodore 64
I K N O W  KO ALAS C O ME
from Australia, but this one is
deﬁnitely American, being an
art package of a high calibre. It
comes f r o m  t h e  K o a l a
Technologies Corporation, the
software is written by Audio
Light UK and distribution is in
the care of Audiogenic.
"Koala Pad" Touch
Tablet.
Attractively packaged i n  a
bright red box, Koala's touch
tablet comes complete with
operating instructions for the
software and touch tablet, plus
a stylus for  drawing on the
touch-tablet.
-tablet.
Readers might ﬁnd useful
the following brief explanation
of how a basic touch-tablet
works. Imagine two sets o f
wires running north to south,
and east t o west. When the
stylus is pressed onto the board
it pushes down on to the wires
and c ontac t between t h e
horizontal and vertical wires
induces x and y coordinates in
one form or another. These are
then translated in t o  signals
which can be understood by
the computer.
The s oftware w hic h i s
supplied is available on tape or
disc and, as usual, it took a
long time to load from tape. In
this int er v al I  t o o k  t h e
opportunity t o  ﬂick through
the manual and immediately
observed that it was written for
the disc-based system, with just
an ins er t f o r  tape-users.
However, s inc e t h e  Koala
tablet is  so easy to use, the
E
concise!
The Koala pad itself is made
of a very strong plastic, and it
plugs into Joystick Port 1. A
long cable facilitates armchair
operation a n d  t her ef or e
greater comfort. I t  uses two
D R A W N
TOGETHER
registers t o  gain t h e  stylus
location information from the
pad. For example, here is a
simple little r outine whic h
changes the colours o f  the
screen as the stylus is moved
around the touch-pad:-
10 A=PEEK(54297):B=PEEK
(54298)
20 P0KE5328,0,A:POKE
53281,13
30 GOT010
It's crude but effectivel
Another application could
be t h e  creation o f  a  new
musical instrument by  using
two different voice registers on
the SID chip. However, I am
digressing from the main thrust
of this article — it is so easy to
indulge in these fascinating by-
plays!
Koala Painter
In conjunction with the Koala
Pad, the Koala Painter opens up
a new world for the user who
wants t o  create high-level
graphics w it h relative ease.
With quick pen strokes you can
switch from facility to facility,
from paint brush t o  paint
brush. This ensemble is by no
means a direct competitor to
the Pluto Graphics machine,
but for around E80, it is good
value for money.
Once loaded, the machine
displays the painter menu. It is
divided into three sections:
commands which ﬂash when
activated; brushes, u n d e r
which relevant item a  small
block appears; colour palette
on which 16 different colours
are displayed, together with a
further 16 patterned colours
below them.
There a r e  1 7  differ ent
commands, of which 14 apply
to graphics. The remaining 3
are facilities for  erasing the
total picture, saving or loading
a picture, and erasing the last
penstroke made.
When you enter the storage
mode you can select either
tape of disc for your medium.
This facility also enables you to
initialise a new disc without
exitting t h e  program. The
"Oops ' c ommand i s  very
useful indeed, because it is
almost certain that at some
time when you are using the
painter, a mistake will be made.
This command will remove the
last penstrokes or "ﬁlls" made
on the picture, enabling you to
start i t  again. T h e  Erase
command simply removes the
picture o n  the ﬁrst screen,
leaving i t  ready for .another
classic masterpiece.
The 14 graphics commands
enable you to simply draw or
construct a picture from the
box or circle commands at will.
A selection of the commands
which I  must mention are,
" X C O L O R "  ( A m e r ic a n
spelling, not mine!) which will
change a particular colour in
the pic ture t o  another by
nominating t he new colour
desired and then placing the
cursor pointer over the target
colour.
The next command is called
"Mirror". This simply splits the
screen into quarters and copies

whatever i s  drawn i n  o n e
section into the others, line for
line. H o w e v e r ,  i f  a f t e r
completing a complex picture,
you w a n t  t o  tr ans fer  a
particular object which y ou
have created to another space
in the picture, the "Mirror"
command will not sufﬁce, as
the objec t i n  ques tion i s
already on the screen; this is
where the "Copy" command
comes into it's own.
Koala's "Copy" command
reproduces t h e  d e s ir e d
graphics and, since it is a square
around the particular shape
you're after, it also reproduces
the graphics on the periphery
of t h e  command's ac tion.
Perhaps the user could beneﬁt
from this useful tip which
picked u p  whils t play ing
around with this section; this
involves the use of another
command c alled " Sw a p " .
Basically what this command
does it to transfer the user from
one screen to a second screen.
I found that, by transferring the
graphics I wished to copy to the
second screen, and then by
using the "Draw" command in
the s ame c olour  a s  t  he
background, I could eliminate
the peripheral graphics not
required, and then transfer it
back to the original screen.
Finally, i n  the command
section I decided to see how
•accurate the "Fill" command
would be_. The manual says that
it can spill into other areas of
the picture if the graphics are
not completely enclosed. This
is logical but attention is drawn
to the fact that you can only use
3 colours and a background
colour in a given space.
With this  information i n
mind, I started to play with the
"Fill". It is most efﬁcient but
colour-collision does  occur
when more than the stipulated
number of colours are used.
feel that this is not so much due
to t h e  limitations  o f  t h e
software, b u t  possibly t  he
computer itself restricts the
more ambitious inclinations of
the exploring user! (Yes, even
the C B M  6 4  c annot d o
everything!)
Brushing up
This package contains more
brushes than Rolf Harris's paint
box! Seriously though, 8
brushes are supplied in  the
Koala Painter from a single line
to ﬁve lines, or even a very
thick brush. So, in conjunction
with some of the commands
such as "Frame" you get some
very pleasant designs to play
with. Instead of getting a single
box on the screen you get ﬁve
or, if you wish, by using the
"Draw ' command, y ou can
literally sign your signature on
the screen. Mind you, it does
not run fast enough to facilitate
a normal writing speed but, at
medium pace, it will give a fair
representation. This is a good
way of discovering how fast a
package r u n s ,  a n d  h o w
accurate it can draw.
We now move on t o an
important part of the software
the "Colour Palette". It is
most interesting to see how this
section has  been designed.
There are 16 solid colours and
16 patterned colours f r o m
which t o  c hoos e. I f  f o r
example, you wished to have a
patterned colour comprised of
red and blue, you would move
the pointer over the red solid
square and press the button on
the pad. The border of  the
screen turns  r ed, a n d  t h e
patterned colours a ll n o w
contain red as one of the two
colours. You then simply move
the pointer over the desired
patterned c o l o u r  w h i c h
appears under the blue colour.
You c an now  paint i n  the
patterned c olour, o r  mor e
frequently it would be used to
ﬁll in a section of the screen.
There is an arrow marker at
the side of the Colour Palette
which indicates the type o f
colour being used e i t h e r
solid or patterned, thus you do
not mistakenly use the wrong
type and have to resort to the
"Oops" command! In theory,
since y ou have available 16
solid and 16 patterned colours,
256 combinations are achie-
vable.
Pictures outside t h e
program
It is  most likely that, if you
create a good picture, you will,
like a l l  ar tis ts  w a n t  a n
exhibition f o r  family  and
friends t o  admire your skill.
You will also want to show it
without all the hassle of loading
the art program. Well, Koala
have had the foresight to put a
program in the manual which
will enable you t o  load the
picture from disc without using
the Koala Painter. You may
have already spotted that I said
"disc" and not "tape" as well. I
would have thought that since

6 4  G r a p h i c s
1E
most c omputer owners a t
present have only cassette and
not disc, it  would be more
advantageous to include a tape
version of the program. As I
said earlier, t h e  manual is
written for disc users and not
the cassette-tied populace. But
even so, this does mean that if
you are an adventure fanatic,
you could design the graphics
for your latest adventure, and
by using the program in the
manual, display them via the
disc.
Now, t h r o u g h o u t  t h k
article, I have not mentioned
anything a b o u t  e x a m p le
graphic screens. The manual
and all the other bits of paper
coming with the Koala Pad do
not mention any extra screens
so, obviously, there aren't any.
Wrong —  there is a picture
contained in the tape directly
after the program itself. This
depicts a jungle scene and is
quite good. So why did they
not say something about it in
the manual? I don't know —
people are funny!
To conclude
Although this is not the only
package available for graphics,
considering all factors, plusses
and minusses, a t  H O  o r
thereabouts i t  is  jolly  good
value f o r  mo n e y  w i t h  a

DESIGNER 64
Studio Software
E32.95
Commodore 64
QUOTING THE MAN U AL,
Designer 64 is a design and
layout application program
which incorporates a screen
character layout editor and a
program generator.
As a l l  Commodor e 6 4
owners know, this computer is
capable o f  t r e m e n d o u s
graphics w i t h  t h e  r i g h t
software. A lot of potential for
good but simple graphics are
built in via the keyboard but, if
you know how, then greater
things are possibie.
I expected to be able to tap
some of the 64's true potential
from this piece o f  software,
especially as it carries the much
desired Commodor e A p p -
roved Logo. It is possible that
the product I received was pre-
release as it came to me in a
plastic b a g  w i t h  a  la b e l
indicating what i t  was. The
manual is substantial (A4) size,
of considerable thickness and
very clear and easy to read.
Aims and ambitions
With this program it was my
intention t o  bang out some
rather nice introduction pages
to some o f  the programs I
write. Also, I was going to lay
out s ome day-to-day diary
pages. I  had success on the
second job but not the ﬁrst.
Read on and I  shall explain
why.
My c opy  c ame w it h  a
second disc which had a few
dempns tr ation pic tur es .
created with the software. The
most interesting part of  the
package was that, after a design
had been created, the program
could translate what you had
into a BASIC program, and that
the BASIC listing could then be
used in your own programs. To
help achieve this, a  merge
routine could be used outside
the program but, I must point
out that it would have nothing
to do with gosubs and gotos so
its use is  limited; however,
used within the context o f
Designer 6 4  i t  i s  perfectly
adequate.
Using thes e facilities, I
designed my  diary page and
saved it to disc. I then wrote a
little bit of BASIC around the
program asking the date and
the day of the week and, also,
for how many days I wanted a
printout. After inputting this
information, it would print out
pages of a diary which I often
use. It is cheaper than a diary
and, of course, I can have as
many diaries as I  choose. A
useful application but hardly
one to stretch a program to its
limits.
Underused
The idea is to choose a shape.
When you have chosen the
shape you want, which must be
a letter, number or graphics
key, you then manipulate the
shape. Y o u  c an magnify ,
reduce, rotate and move i t
around t h e  screen, ﬁll t h e
page with it and so on. The
most important thing to note is
that you are limited to the pre-
deﬁned C ommodor e k ey
shapes. To my mind this was
hardly adequate. I t  was not
possible to draw true straight
lines except by plotting a line of
the relevant characters; a n
absence of commands such as
circle, etc. meant that it was
difﬁcult to make anything look
better than 'lumpy', for want of
a better word. I can achieve
almost t he same results by
clearing the screen, placing the
characters I want to make the
desired picture on the screen,
putting a  l i n e  n u m b e r ,
question mark and a  quote
mark at the extreme left edge
of t he screen and pressing
return. Repeat this down the
screen and youthen have your
design as program lines: most
important o f  a l l  i t  costs
nothing!
Admittedly a  degree o f
animation is  possible w it h
Designer 64 but nothing that
could not be done fairly simply
through BASIC anyway. All this
software does  i s  tak e t h e
graphic capabilities of the 64 at
its lowest level, beef up the
way y o u  c an mov e t h e m
around o n  screen, change
colours and tur n i t  into a
ﬁnished subroutine. Deeper
reading of the manual reveals
that almost half of it  is not
concerned with actually using
the graphics s ide o f  t h e
machine b u t  with disc use
aspects a n d  glos s ar ies .
Without practice this was
not an easy program to use and
there w a s  m u c h  t o  b e
remembered. U s e o f  t h e
keyboard and function keys
was good though, and o n
screen prompts were logical. It
was possible to get good screen
dumps using a  Commodore
pr inter  b u t  t h e r e  w a s
absolutely no help given in the
manual for the many people
who u s e  non-Commodore
machines. If you want screen
dumps from any of the more
popular dot-matrix printers
you would have to work out
your own way of doing it.
More potential
Designer 64 is not an expensive
program compared t o  some
but it  is certainly not in the
pocket money bracket. To be
honest, I don't think I would
buy i t  unless I  had a  very
speciﬁc use for its facilities. I
must stress that i t  is  very
deﬁnitely a  low-resolution
drawing aid and therefore lacks
a lot o f  potential. I  get the
feeling that i t  is  a  wasted
opportunity and that for just a
few pounds more it would be
possible t o  g e t  f a r  more
sophisticated design packages.
Look closely at it before you
buy as I feel that you may not
be getting quite what you
expect. T o  b e  fair  though
it does what it does very well
and, if its design potential is
adequate for what you want,
then it is an excellent product
and should make things a lot
easier.

F.G. Tout invites you
to recover the four
crowns of Adelim and
thus succeed where
lesser mortals have
failed.
IN THE PRE-COMMODORE
days of old. Adelim ruled over
the f o u r  k i n g d o m s  o f
Adelanthia. He held the four
crowns and was a wise and
powerful king. But he had an
enemy — his name was Trewis.
He planned and schemed until
one day he slew Adelim and
stole the four crowns. He took
them back to his dark castle
and hid them. Darkness has
prevailed since that time, and
all efforts to regain the crowns
have failed.
One searcher alone, with
courage and determination,
might succeed where armies
have failed...are y o u  t h a t
searcher?

onwards, it's sprites all the way
— all 8  sprites, in  machine
code, plus fast, smooth screen
scrolling on screen 4.

In the fourth part of
this series, Grahame
Davies shows you how
to write your business
programs to disc.
IF YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOW-
ing this series, then by now you
should have nicely ﬁnished
programs t o  enter data and
present it in a neat fashion. To
store this data we will use a disc
drive. Of course, you may wish
to use a cassette recorder to
store data on, but this is not to
be recommended for several
reasons: ﬁrs tly , a n d  m o s t
obv ious ly , C o m m o d o r e
cassettes are slow, secondly
you can practically only store
data in a sequential format and
so t o  r ead o n e  particular
record, you will always have to
start at the ﬁrst record and scan
through the ﬁle, thirdly you
cannot update one record
w it hout  r e - w r i t i n g  t h e
complete ﬁle and so the only
practical way to use a cassette is
to read the complete ﬁle into
the computer at the start of the
program and to write it all back
at the end of  the program;
doing this will severely limit the
amount of data you can store.
Sequential disc ﬁles
Sequential ﬁles on disc, have
the same qualities as sequential
ﬁles on tape but are faster.
There are good reasons for
using them though —  f o r
instance y ou may require a
transaction list of some sort and
would never need to look at a
single record so a sequential
ﬁle would be suitable. To make
this clearer, say y ou wer e
writing a program to take care
of your record collection. You
would have a ﬁle of record
names together with details
about those records and you
would w a n t  t o  access a n
indiv idual r e c o r d  s o  a
sequential ﬁle would not be
E
wanted to know where all your
records are (who you have lent
them to and so on) then every
time you tell your program you
have lent a record out, it would
make a n  e n t r y  o n  t h e
transaction ﬁle. Every record
returned would also have an
DOING IT
YOURSELF
entrron this ﬁle and each new
entry would be added to the
end of the ﬁle. When you come
to list this ﬁle you will simply
read it from the start and print
out every entry. Reading a
sequential ﬁle from start to end
is faster than doing the same
with relative ﬁles (see below)
and sequential ﬁles are easier
to maintain.
Most of you reading this
article will be using a 1541 disc
drive and if you are then you
must be aware that it has a fault
which can easily be (and must
be) avoided. When overwriting
a directory entry using the ' 0
feature, the ﬁle may become
corrupt. T h is  applies  t o
program ﬁles and sequential
ﬁles. To avoid this, always use
the scratch, rename and save
facilities:
that you end up with a back-up
version of the ﬁle being saved.
Relative ﬁles
Relative ﬁles can look difﬁcult
and clumsy to use at ﬁrst but
are in fact a very good way to
store data allowing plenty of
ﬂexibility. I f  you are using a
machine w i t h  BASIC  4 . 0
instructions then the following
conversions w ill b e  o f  n o
interest although they will still
work. For the rest of us with
BASIC 2.0 as on the VIC 20 or
the CBM 64 all we need to do is
tackle the awkward commands
once a n d  create them a s
subroutines. Having done this
they will become simple to use.
The end result o f  using a
relative ﬁle is that every time
you update a record, it is always
immediately written back t o
the disc whic h means that
starting t h e  program a n d
ending the program does not
involve lengthy waits while
data is being read in or written
back. This also means that we
can store unlimited amounts of
data (you just have t o  buy
another or a bigger disc drive if
scratch ﬁlename + ".bak"
rename ﬁlename to ﬁlename
+ ".bak"
save ﬁlename
You will notice that these are
not BASIC commands but just
general guidelines  t o  t h e
saving o f  ﬁles . A n o t h e r
advantage of doing it this way is y ou run out of space).
to explain the principal of a
relative ﬁle, take a plain sheet
of paper and down the left
hand side from top to bottom
write down the integers 1 to 20.
Each o f  t h e s e  in t e g e r s
represents a record. The blank
space to the right of the record
represents t h e  data that is
stored in  that record. If we
select a record, say number 3,
then we can immediately go to
record number 3  an s tar t
writing data in it. We carry on
writing to it until we reach the
far edge of the paper when we
run out of room. The amount
of data we have now written,
represents the record length.
We could write in every record
of the sheet (the ﬁle) until we
reached the bottom and then
we would take another sheet of
paper and so on. If we wanted
to write so much data against
one record that it would not ﬁt
on that line, then we would
have to throw that piece of
paper away and start with a new
and wider piece. In practice of
course you would probably just
squeeze an extra word or two
in but when using disc drives
you obviously cannot.
A relative ﬁle takes the same
format as your piece of paper:
at the start you decide how
wide it is to be (the record
length) and what name to call
it. These two things cannot be
changed later and s o i t  is
important that you get them
right ﬁrst time. If you try to
write past the end of the ﬁle
(off the bottom of the paper)
then a  r elativ e ﬁl e  w ill
automatically m a k e  its elf
bigger —  t h i s  i s  c alled
expanding. When we create a
relative ﬁle, we will pre-expand
it. The reason for this is that
expanding takes extra time
which you will not want when
your pr ogr am i s  running.
Another point is that if you try
to write past the end of the ﬁle,
the disc drive will ﬁrst of all
return an error (50 — record
not present) which is really just
a warning message. When you
=

print to the ﬁle it will expand
itself and the next time you
access that record the error
message will not be returned.
This means that y our error
checking code will have t o
allow for this and this makes it
messier.
Accessing a record
When accessing a record we
use t h e  equivalent o f  t h e
RECORD command which is in
the form RECORD ﬁle number,
record number, byte position.
The b y t e pos ition i s  t h e
position along the record to
start from. If this is not sent, or
is zero or one, then we will look
at the record starting from the
ﬁrst character. If it is ﬁve then
we will start character number
ﬁve in that record. Of course,
BASIC 2.0 does not have a
RECORD command so there is
a subroutine to replace it but if
you think of it in the same
terms as above, it will be easier
to use.
Expanding a ﬁle
The following listing incorpo-
rates a subroutine to expand a
ﬁle with the ﬁlename given in f$
(less than 17 characters long),
the record length in r% (up to
and including 254 characters)
and the number of records to
pre-expand the ﬁle to in s%
(remember that you can always
make it longer later on). To
expand t h e  ﬁl e  w e  w i l l
RECORD to position s% and
print a  chr$(255) there. The
reason for this is that when a
relative ﬁle is expanded, all of
the empty  rec ords  aut o-
matically g e t  created w i t h
chr$(255) and you can use this
fact to look for empty records
within a ﬁle.
Note that the listing is split into
three subroutines t o  create a
ﬁle, call line 2000, the routine at
2100 is a RECORD routine and
there is a disc status checker at
2900. I suggest you make this a
separate p r o g r a m w h i c h
prompts you for the ﬁle name
and so on. If you want to use
the character position facility
then I  suggest you pass the
subroutines another variable
called bp% and change line
2140 to end with chrS(bp%)
instead of chr$(1). Note this is
for use in your main line code
only and is NOT suitable for
creating a ﬁle. If you alter line
2180 to read gosub2900:return
then y ou c an inc lude t h e
subroutines at 2100 and 2900 1 n

At this point I will just point
out a few other things to be

the INPUT command from disc,
you will ﬁnd that it behaves just
the same as INPUT from the

At this point y ou should

Note that when you use the
PRINT command, t h e  com-

semi-colon ';' as in line 2440.
The reason for suppressing this
extra carriage return is that if
you have a record length of 30
characters and y ou send a
record that is  30 characters
long, when you print this to the
disc, the extra carriage return

record).
Record keeping system
We can now put these routines
to good use by creating a fast
access record keeping system.
The method to be used is called
hashing and you will ﬁnd that it
is well suited to relative ﬁles.
The p r in c ip a l i s  s tr aight
forward. When you want to call
up an item from disc, you have
to tell the computer something
you know about that item and
this information is called the
key. A key can take any form
you like — a part number, a
name, letters and numbers
mixed and so on. The only
restricting factor is that to call
up an item you must type its
key exactly, a s  ju s t  o n e
difference in the key will cause
the program t o  look at the
wrong part of the ﬁle. From this
key, we will form a "random"
number and we will use this
number to calculate where to
look in the ﬁle. The best thing
to use is  the Commodore's
random number generator fo
this purpose but y ou mus
remember that this you
number has to be calculated to
the same result every time you
wish to call up that record.
The next routine creates a
random number from a key
passed to it in kS. If you call this

P r o g r a m m i n g
routine with the same key it
should always return the same
number. You could of course
write your own algorithm in
here and for some applications
this will be very important. This
particular one scans along the
key and takes the ASCII o f
every character and multiplies
it by it's position in the key and
then adds it into a variable 'a'.
The reason t hat  w e  mus t
multiply by the position is so
that a key "ABC" does not give
the same result as "CBA" and
so on. Having done this we
seed t h e  r andom number
generator with the negative
value a n d  t h e n  t a k e  t h e
random of  that number and
convert that into an integer
between one and the ﬁle size

them and I will then explain

RUN the program, type 'c' for
create and type in the key as
"abd" and any data that you
went to be the record. Note
that the program expects a
retative ﬁle called "test" to be
set up with a minimum of one
hundred records and a record
length o f  about ﬁfty bytes.
When this key "abd" is created,
it :s created at position 42. This
will not be true if you typed the
key in upper case or  if you
mixed lower and upper case. If
you want t o avoid problems
with upper and lower case then
change line 2540 to this:

records have got chr$(255) in

would not be able to call up key
"dcr" because this key would
hash t o  42 which is  now a
chr$(255) a n d  t h e  r outine
would say that that is an empty
record and stop searching. If
you don't believe this then
change line 340 to read:
340 k S=c hi$( 2 55): rcii=
"deleted"
Now delete "abd" and try to
amend "dcr". Having done this
change line 340 back to what it
should be. To overcome this
we have a special ﬂag on the
disc. I  have chosen t o  use
chrS(254) a s  y o u  a r e  v ery
unlikely to have this as your key
— if you did use it as a valid key,
you would cause havoc with
your data! Using the above
example, deleting "abd" will
cause a chr$(254) to be written
to the disc at position 42. The
routine for scanning for a key at
2600 will treat this as any other
key and not assume end of
tile. The only special handling
in there is the waiable'dc'. This
is set to zero on entry and if the
scan ﬁnds a chr$(254) it is set to
that disc position. Note that on
one scan, it only sets 'dc' to the
ﬁrst chrS(254) found as there
may be others. This ﬂag is then
used in the create part in line
160. T h e  c r eat e r o u t in e
logically says: check the key
does not already exist : if not
then enter the data :  now
create the record at dr which is
the position of the chrS(255)
found b y  t h e  scan routine
unless w h i l e  w e  w e r e
scanning we found a chrSi 254)
— if so then create it there at
that position (dc).
Using the above methods
you should have a reasonable
fast access system. As  more
items are put on, the access
time w ill s low b u t  should
remain acceptable until the ﬁle
becomes about seventy per
cent full. This will depend on
how g o o d  y o u r  has hing
algorithm i s  and a  certain
amount of luck as to whether
the keys used create a good
spread across the ﬁle.

Simon Palmer comes
out of his shell to
look at the Valiant
Turtle and the
language it speaks,
LOGO.
ONE OF THE BIGGEST STEPS
so f a r  i n  e d u c a t i o n a l
computing has to be LOGO. It
is a language which is  very
powerful yet simple to use.
LOGO is  a language which
children ﬁnd easy to grasp, as
so many of the fundamental
words w hic h mak e i t  u p
are similar or the same as the
recognised English deﬁnitions,
they are designed to achieve.
For example, if a child while
using LOGO graphics system
required the TURTLE on the
screen to move forward a set
number of steps, he would not
have to worry about tormu-
lating the BASIC program but
simply type 'FORWARD' and
then a number of steps. Ease of
use is  a  distinct advantage
when teaching a language.
Now, in the past few years a
valuable extension to LOGO
has b e e n  dev eloped. I n
previous years anyone w ho
owned a TURTLE was either
rich or had built it. However,
they have become much more
freely available, and at a price
that can be afforded by the
everyday user. The TURTLE is a
robot which can be controlled
by the computer using LOGO.
It is mainly used in conjunction
with LOGO's "Turtle Grap-
hics".
When these 'pets' were ﬁrst
introduced they were attached
to t h e  c omputer  b y  a n
umbilical c ord which trans-
mitted the data to the robot.
This was a disadvantage as it
limited the range o f  move-
ment. The robot was also bulky
and expensive which meant
that most schools, could not
afford to own one.
Volume manufacturing has
since led t o  a  decrease in
prices. T e c h n o lo g y  has
improved ten fold and the size
of the components has halved.
0111111111*
This has lead to some exciting
developments such as Valiant
Design s TURTLE.
Welcome to the World
of LOGO.
LOGO is  and has for  quite
a while, been given little or no
acknowledgement o f  i t s
existence in the U.K. by the
general public. A few pockets
of ac tiv ity  i n  schools o r
computer clubs and the odd
article have reminded people
of i t s  existence. Perhaps
because it  doesn't have the
software, games or otherwise,
it has  been unfairly over-
looked, But the time has come
for people to recognise that it
is not just another language but
that it is more powerful than
BASIC.
LOGO i s  a  procedural
language. This  means that
when a program is generated,
it i s  s tr uc tur ed o u t  o f
procedures. These procedures
are either the primitives of the
language or have been created
to perform a certain function_
When a set of procedures are
used together, they may call on
each other  t o  determine a
result as well as performing
their own independent tasks.
Speak the same
language
In LOGO, the language has
been speciﬁcally designed to
bring b o t h  t h e  Englis h
Language and the Computer
Language closer together t o

spectrum of ages. The words

used in LOGO are very similar
to t h e  wor ds  t hat  w ould
describe t h e  func tion i n
English. So in theory, a child or
adult could start using LOGO
almost immediately. LOGO
enables the user to deﬁne a
function and then allow him to
use a word to deﬁne the task in
question. He can then use the
word every time the program
requires t h is  tas k  t o

The best way to describe

PROCEDURE.
Commodore
Logo
In this plain, small, no-frills
box, Commodore supply you
with the Language (on disk),
the manual which totals well
over 300 pages, a utility disk
and a damaged disk replace-
ment card. When I thumbed
through the manual I found it
easy to read and understand,
but if I had been a seven or
eight year old working alone
with LOGO then I would have
had difﬁc ulties . I  w o u ld ,
therefore, suggest that if you
are a parent thinking of buying
LOGO f o r  y o u r  s o n  o r
daughter, make sure that you
can get hold of workbooks for
beginners and then use the
manual as a reference instead
of a tutorial.
After saying that, I  must
confuse the issue a little by
adding that there is a Utility
Disk with some ﬁne examples
of LOGO graphics and other
items c ontained w it h  t h e
Language disk which might
help.
Logo Graphics
This is  t h e  mos t powerful
section in LOGO. It is worth
remembering that a child will
ﬁnd working with a language
more stimulating if he or she
can make pretty patterns or
draw a house or just be very
creative. So it is logical to think
that when this language was
designed with education i n
mind, that it would be heavily
orientated towards graphics.
For example, if I  wanted to
draw a square in LOGO I would
not have to thin kof the various
detils of BASIC, I could simply
type the following:-
Example 1
TO SQUARE
FD 3 0
RT 9 0
FT 3 0
RI 9 0
FD 3 0
RT 9 0
FD 3 0
RT 9 0
END
or
Example 2
TO SQUARE
REPEAT 4(FD 3 0  RT 360/4)
END
Both of the above perform the
same task. One is simply an
abbreviation of the other.
In Example 1, I  gave the
procedure the name SQUARE.
I then gave the command FD
(forward) 30 and RT (right) 90
four times. This made t he
TURTLE move 30 units forward
and turned 90 degrees to the
right four  times. Example 2
does the same, except I have
used a primitive and a different
way of getting the angle by
dividing the total number of
degrees in a circle by the four
sides.
So, after playing with the
standard graphics via LOGO I
decided to move on to higher
things. I  ﬂicked through my
manual until I  came t o  the
Sprites chapter. Within this I
found that the Utilities disk not
only contained examples o f
how the Sprites could be used
but also a  Sprite Editor t o
enable the design of Sprites,
always a tricky problem.
For example, if you wanted
to move a sprite across the
whole of the screen you would
have t o  set the MSB (Most
Signiﬁcant Bit ) ,  w h ic h  i s
Location 53264. This would, in
BASIC, enable a sprite to move
on its Xco-ordinate across to
the righthand edge o f  the
screen wher e t h e  register
would normally b e  greater
than 255. Well, on LOGO that is
already taken care of.
What a b o u t  s pr ite t o
background and sprite to sprite
collision? The detection of a
Sprite hitting another Sprite is
again a complex affair? But on
LOGO t h e r e  a r e  t w o
procedures found o n  t h e
Utilities disk which enable the
computer to gain the necessary
data to decide if a collision has
occurred. They are "TB" which
checks f o r  b a c k g r o u n d
collision and " I S? '  w hic h
checks for Sprite collision. A
not s o complex problem is
getting an enlarged sprite to
appear. With BASIC you have
two locations 53271 and 53277
which c ontr ol expansion.
Whereas o n  LOGO, BIGX,
SMALLX, SMALLY, will sufﬁce
to complete the job.
I was surprised, however,
that the manual does not make
any reference to Multicolour
Sprites. I n  the 21 pages on
Sprites it dealt with everything
from deﬁning to saving, but
nothing at all on Multicolour
mode. It is also worth pointing
out that most of the control of
Sprites, i.e. the commands, can
only be found on the Utilites
disk so it is worth making a
back-up c opy  jus t i n  case
something happens.
Sound
When I loaded the ﬁrst ﬁle for
music o n  t he Utilities disc
called Music, I  watched i t
deﬁne the various procedures
required to gain Sound. I was
expecting more commands to
be deﬁned but unfortunately
only items such as  Attack,
Decay, Sustain and Release are
there. I n  a ll fairness, even
though t h e  p r o c e d u r e s
deﬁned for music are very few,
they are the important items
required for  complex music
making and obviously, if there
isn't enough there, you can
create a  new procedure by
using t h e  v arious  LO G O
machine code primitives.
Machine code
It is  worth mentioning this
subject as we are in LOGO and
LOGO is supposed to make the
execution of jobs easier. Well,
again some former knowledge
of programming is required if
you are going to beneﬁt from
the v a r io u s  c o m m a n d s
supplied.
Brieﬂy, they have supplied
on the Utilities disca copy of an
assembler t o  enable t h e
structuring o f  c ode. T h e
manual then goes on to explain
how t o  r u n  t h e  L O G O

1
R e v i e w s
assembler and also gives an
example o f  how t o  change
colours via machine code.
Words, words, words
Words and Lists is the largest
section in the LOGO language
book even though it covers a
relatively s mall ar ea ( 1 7
primitives). Wher eas  t h e
graphics section would in most
cases be of a direct input and
result nature, Words and Lists
requires indirect operations.
This set of primitives allows
you to generate data bases all
the w a y  t o  " in t e llig e n t "
software. Now I am not going
to get into the argument of
whether computers c an o r
cannot be intelligent, but with
the aid of the primitives the
computer can learn and react
after a  speciﬁc action has
happened.
Commodore has supplied a
game on the Utilities disc to
illustrate this very point.
Finally
Much more on this fascinating
subject can be found out by
using the package and the
TURTLE together or just LOGO
on its own. It is worth bearing
in mind that even though it is a
teaching language, the subtlety
of a high-level language has
been inc orporated. Items
which appear within LOGO
but do not appear in BASIC can
also be found in  the more
powerful languages available
on the open market. So when
the user has learned to work
with c omputer s  h e  c a n ,
without changing languages,
continue on to higher things.
The Valiant designs
Turtle
The Valiant TURTLE, designed
for use with LOGO, is prepared
for battle and ready to run as
soon as you remove it from the
box. It comes complete with an
infra-red controller, a power
supply/recharger, the various
manuals and paperwork, and
obviously the software.
On your marks
Before starting to connect the
TURTLE I  read through the
manual. The points which are
worth noting here are that the
manual can be read by anyone.
If they are being taught, it's an
aid and if you are teaching it's a
guide t o  enable s mooth
operations. The manual does
contain a  large selection o f
cartoons illus tr ating t h e
various stages in  which the
TURTLE can be involved and
these highlight very well, any
problems that might occur
whilst setting the machine up
or airing operation. They also
had the foresight to include a
large s ec tion o n  tr ouble-
shooting a n d  t h e  various
remedies to be administered to
any ailing TURTLES.
The one criticism I  must
make is that even though there
is a  high-quality magazine
called PEN-UP included, I
would like to have seen a few
example programs contained
either with the software or the
manual.
Get set
After perusing the paperwork,
I started to set up the hardware.
Firstly, t h e  TURTLE its elf.
Constructed out of very robust
plastic, the green see-through
shell provides a perfect view of
the internal workings which
have been anchored safely to a
cream base. At the front of the
TURTLE t w o  light-emitting
diodes give an indication of
whether the TURTLE is up to
strength b y  maintaining a
constant light or by ﬂashing to
indicate that recharging isn't
far off. On the main board of
the TURTLE ar e t w o  extra
L.E.D's. These tell you whether
the signals are being received
by the TURTLE or whether it is
recharging safely.
The infra-red transmitter
plugs into the User Port on the
CBM 64. The transmitter is
powered b y  a  transformer
which als o recharges t h e
TURTLE. O nc e t h e  various
items are plugged in and you
have lo a d e d  t h e  L O G O
package into the computer,
the TURTLE software can be
loaded.
Go!
The Valiant TURTLE software,
when loaded, redeﬁnes some
of LOGO's primitives. This
makes writing software, which
will work with the TURTLE, a
little bit difﬁcult as they do not
describe w h a t  has  b e e n
changed. Now everything has
been set up, you can check the
accuracy o f  y our  TURTLE.
Valiant supply with the TURTLE
one marker pen and also one
screwdriver. When the TURTLE
is ready to work you can adjust
the wheels to enable a greater
degree o f  accuracy whils t
drawing.
The most efﬁcient way is to
get the TURTLE t o  draw a
square.
Example
TO SQUARE
REPEAT 4(FD 3 0  R T  360/41
The above procedure in LOGO
should be enough to enable
accurate adjus tment. T h e
adjustment is made by turning
the screws which move the
wheels either  near er t h e
TURTLE body or further away.
Turtle on the run
The TURTLE when working
moves at a steady speed. One
problem I did come across is
that the space between the
wheels and the ﬂoor is very
small. This will lead t o  the
TURTLE catching itself and
being left high and dry. So
make sure it is used on a level
surface.
The ﬁn a l i t e m  t o  b e
connected to the TURTLE was
the marker pen. This is inserted
into a holder which is serviced
by a small servo-motor. The
two LOGO commands to raise
and lower the pen are PEN UP
and PENDOWN (PU and PD for
short). Make sure that when
you wr ite a  procedure t o
incorporate s ome TURTLE
graphics with movement of the
robot you use these commands
otherwise, like I did at ﬁrst, you
will get more lines than you
bargained for.
From start to ﬁnish
I found the TURTLE a pleasure
to use; it is very easy to set up
and even easier to operate.
Commands such as TURTLE
which w ill direct the input
from t h e  computer t o  the
TURTLE or, if the command is
repeated, will stop the signals
are very useful. The operation
of the TURTLE can be speeded
up marginally by  hiding the
computer's sprite version of
the TURTLE. This means there
is less for  the computer to
operate.
So, taking all into account
the TURTLE i s  a  valuable
extension t o  t h e  computer
system.

Dave Crisp throws some light
upon a couple of the more
popular lightpens on the
market.
A COUPLE OF YEARS ,AGO IT WAS ONLY
possible to see lightpens being used on
the mos t expensive computers. Be -
tween now and then the lightpen has
been made t o  seem old hat. Special
monitors now give the user the ability to
simply touch the screen with their ﬁnger
to make a  decision relevant t o  the
program, but it is going to be a long time
before this  system is  available a t  a
reasonable enough price to implement in
the home.
Until then one thing that can take the
place of the keyboard in some respects is a
Ightpen. It is called a lightpen because of
its shape and the fact that it responds to
light emitted from the TV or monitor
screen. A lead connects the pen to a port
on the computer and it is linked to the
main program by short subroutines which
are able to detect the pen's position on
the screen. It is able to do this because the
monitor screen is scanned at a particular
rate. When the lightpen is pointed at the
screen and a switch is pressed, the de-
coding software calculates the position of
the pen from the point at which the scan is
detected.
In older pens ambient light often
made reading the position of the pen a
very hit and miss affair but, with improved
circuitry, it is possible for the pen to react
only to light from the monitor. The main
use for lightpens on home micros seems
to be for drawing and design programs.
Software detects the position of the pen
on the screen and as you move the pen a
line may be drawn or the position of the
pen may be a reference point for the start
of a line, circle or triangle etc. It is also
possible to indicate the part of a drawing
which is to be ﬁlled with colour. All these
things could be done with the cursor keys
but in most cases the use of a lightpen
speeds u p  positioning and improves
accuracy.
Another use for  a  lightpen is  i n
programs where a lot of decisions are to
be made. Since I've had the Stack lightpen
i have been able to write a couple of
educational games where my youngest
daughter c a n  c omplete t h e  w h o le
program without using the keyboard.
There is no need for her to be able to
recognise letters or keys as the options
can b e displayed o n the screen in a
graphic form and the decisions can be
made from this.
It is usually fairly easy to adapt home
written software to work with a lightpen
but it is also easy to go overboard with the
pen. If the user continually has to go from
E
again it becomes as much a trial as a
beneﬁt. I have not seen much software
available to use with lightpens in a useful
way and, as I am a nurse by trade and
have a couple of patients who have lost
most of the use in their arms, I feel that it
should b e  possible for  m e  t o  write
•
software where they are able to use a
computer in many ways using only the
lightpen, possibly in  their mouths t o
amuse, educate and help them.
Datapen lightpen (price: f25_00)
The Datapen Lightpen is easy t o  use
and comes with three programs to get you
started. It is plugged into one of  the
joystick ports and the lead is long enough
to enable you to reach all the screen.
Although that sounds obvious I have seen
a lightpen where it was only possible to
reach one side of the screen. The software
with the pen (tape based) can be saved
easily to disc, and the ﬁrst program simply
tells a  little about the program and
enables y ou t o  move sprite graphics
around the screen. It also shows the way
movement of the pen effects the variable
values used in the detection of the pen
point. The other two programs are both
for drawing on screen. The ﬁrst allows
low-res block graphics in all the colours
on the 64 to be drawn on the screen, the
second allows drawing in high-res mode.
This mode is  single colour but with
practice neat little drawings could be
achieved and then save to tape. In order to
save the disc it was ﬁrst necessary to
slightly adapt the program. My  young
children enjoy ed t h e  t w o  graphic
programs and soon they became quite
proﬁcient. T h e  manual that comes
FA A S T I C
with the pen is of a fairly low quality
but it is packed with useful information
which makes using the lightpen in your
own programs very easy indeed.
Quality of ﬁnish
When you use it in your own software the
switch on the pen can be programmed in
such a way as to make the pen inoperative
until the point is at the desired location or
to perform a particular operation when it
is pressed. This is a feature that was
missing on some earlier pens and it made
them difﬁcult to use. The quality of ﬁnish
on the pen was not fantastic compared to
the Stack lightoen but it was robust. The
hole at the back of the pen from which the
LED sprouted seemed to have been cut
out with a hammer and chisel and the
moulding of the body was rather spoiled
by a large amount of ﬂash. Small points
these but it could have been ﬁnished a
little better. The LED is there to indicate
that the pen is receiving some sort of
signal and gives out a reassuring glow
when plugged in. When the switch is
pressed it glows brighter and serves to
indicate as a visual reminder that the
position has been calculated. I enjoyed
using this pen and I am sure that, given the
time, I shall be able to use it to its full
potential. It can be made into a useful
item as much at home, in business and
education, as in games.

H a r d w a r e  R e v ie w
Stack L ig h t p e n  (Price: 28.00)
Later I  received t h e  Stack Lightpen.
The pen comes in a fairly stout box along
with a manual and tape based software.
With my SX-64 the ﬁrst thing I had to do
was to get the software onto disc. Fairly
dear instructions are given in the manual
on saving the software to disc with a
monitor. However y ou c an r un into
trouble. Most of the software that comes
with the pen can be loaded and saved as
the programs are all BASIC. The better
games and the Paintbox software are in
machine code and is in several parts. As I
said the documentation tells you how to
save this to disc with the aid of a monitor. I
have three monitors and I could not do it
with any of them as they conﬂicted in
memory with the software. I eventually
managed to save it onto disc.
Playing the games was not exactly
mind blowing and had I bought them I
would have been disappointed. However
they are free and you don't look a gift
horse in the mouth!
Clever these Liverpudlians
The accuracy of the lightpen amazed me,
was lucky enough to talk to a young lad
from Stack a few weeks ago at a trade
show and he took a lot of trouble to
explain to me why the pen was so accurate
and reliable. Many pens simply read the
position at which the pen is pointed and
plot that pos ition. T h e  Stack p e n
however, takes sixteen readings, excludes
the four highest and lowest numbers and
then calculates the mean average of the
remaining eight: very clever and very
reliable. The end result of this is that if you
try to draw a straight line freehand then
you usually manage to. No real need to do
that though as it is possible to LOCK the
TRACK of the pen either horizontally or
vertically and draw dead straight lines
with ease. For diagonal straight lines you
simply PLOT a point where you wish your
line to start, move the pen to the point
where you wish your line to end and press
the up arrow key. Bangs a straight line. A
similar method is used to draw squares
and rectangles. Plot one corner, move the
pen to a position where you would like
the opposing corner to be, press 'Qr
and there you have it. Circles were not
quite as successful as the other shapes but
a similar method is employed and you end
up with a slightly squashed circle.
Unlike a few
Some machines when used with light
pens and drawing aids do not like you
drawing over the screen edge and often
come up with an error report. The Stack
pen however allows you to draw over the
edge. Of course nothing is drawn on the
screen border, but the line or shape will at
least go u p to the edge. I  did ﬁnd,
however, that when this occurred there
were odd times when you would get
wrap-round and the rest of the line would
enter the screen at the opposite edge —
Not a serious problem though.
Finishing touches
The Paintbox  pr ogr am h a d  s ome
fantastic little touches. To my mind the
most impressive was that on one screen
you could have a  set o f  diagramatic
designs, and you could 'PICK UP' the
desired design, 'CARRY' it  onto your
work screen and DROP it where you
wanted: excellent for planning etc. You
are provided with electrical component
designs and house part designs on tape
and that saves you having to draw them.
Another extra is the ability to ZOOM into
a small section of your work sheet. Using
this method it is possible to plot pixel by
pixel and also UNPLOT. This made it
possible to do very precise work and
turned the lightpen from a plaything to a
fairly serious design tool.
Pictures to hang
With a Commodore printer it was easy to
get a screen dump of any masterpieces
you had created (if you can stand the wait)
and also using t he Stack Centronics
interface with another printer.
Ready to improve
Talking to Stack, I learned one or two
snippets o f  information. Improvements
are underway and one o r  two little
niggles I  pointed out appear to have
been noted already and acted upon.
the most frustrating of these was the ease
with which it was possible to lose your
picture. One press of the 'c' key and all
was gone. I lost work on more than one
occasion a n d  tur ned t h e  a ir  blue.
Apparently work is being done on it.
Grizzle number two is the switch on
the pen. It comprises two bands of metal
— one near the end of the pen and one
near the top. Unless y ou have very
large rubber hands it is not easy to
put your hand on both contacts at
once ( t o  activate t h e  switch). This
made use of the pen by children very
difﬁcult and I  soon noticed that, very
often, my ﬁve year old daughter was using
two hands to do it. Apparently this too has
been noticed by Stack and I believe that
later they will have the two bands closer
together at the end of the pen.
First class
Almost everything about this pen was well
above average. The quality of ﬁnish, the
quality of the materials used, the actual
Paintbox software, and so on. Only the
quality of the games provided and the
little faults mentioned above scratched
it's highly polished ﬁnish. One thing I
must point out is that it is not a multi-
Colour paintbox. It is possible to globally
change the colours of screen, ink, and
border but it is not possible to have more
than one ink or screen colour displayed at
once, although I  didn't ﬁnd this too
great a problem.
Below is a quick list of its commands
so you should be able to see what a well
thought out piece of software it is.

This month Bryn
Phillips examines the
creation of User
Deﬁned Graphics on
your VIC 20.
THIS IS THE FOURTH OF A
ﬁve part series of BASIC Games
Programming for the VIC 20.
The series is primarily intended
for newcomers t o  games
programming. but there might
well, be a few useful tips for
seasoned programmers.
The VIC 20 has a very well
thought out graphics set which
can be used to good effect in
many games. However, if you
want a  single character t o
represent an object such as a
dog, an alien or a spaceship it's
really stretching t h e  imag-
ination too far to stick to the
standard graphics set. To get a
professional ﬁnis h t o  y our
game you need to deﬁne your
own characters. T h e  steps
involved i n  c reating Us er
Deﬁned Graphics CUDGs) are
outlined below:
1) Make room in the memory
for the graphic set,
2) Calculate the data for the
UDGs.
3) Put t he UDGs int o t he
reserved memory and direct
the VIC 20 to use the UDGs.
It sounds a lot of work, but and
in p r a c t i c e  i t ' s  q u i t e
straightforward. A few POKEs
and D at a statements, a n d
you're there — but let's start at
the beginning.
Making Room for the
UDGs
The standard character s et
supplied with the VIC 20 is
stored in ROM, and it can't be
altered. If you want your own
customised graphic set y ou
have to put it in RAM. The way
you do this depends on what
expansion you have on board.
This m o n t h  w e  w i l l  b e
considering the UNEXPANDED
VIC 20, and I will go over the
procedure f o r  dealing w ith
expansion in the next article.
The memory m a p  f o r  t h e
unexpanded VIC 20 is shown in
ﬁg la. You can alter the top of
BASIC memory pointer to 7167
as shown in ﬁg lb. Switch on
your VIC 20 and enter:

That's it. You've changed the
memory map. Now enter:

It's gone down to 3069. You've
lost some BASIC, but you've
gained enough space for your
UDGs. In fact you've got room
for 64 — that should beenough
for most games.
Designing the UDGs
Each VIC character is made up
from an 8x8 matrix of pixels. as
illustrated by the rocket in Fig 2_
The rocket is made up of 8
rows, each of  which can be
represented b y  a  binar y
number as shown in Fig 213. The
binary number  i s  obtained
simply b y  designating each
pixel which is switched on as 1,
and eac h p ix e l w h ic h  i s
switched off as O. The binary
number is then converted into
decimal as shown in Fig 2c.
8192
7680
4096
2a and 2b
The process is simpliﬁed by
starting off with a blank grid as
shown in Fig 3, shading in the
required squares, and adding
up the numbers shown at the
top of each column to give the
decimal value of each row.
We're almost there now. All
that is  left is  t o  POKE the
character d a t a  i n t o  t h e
allocated memory locations.

Its unlikely that you will
want to re-deﬁne the entire
character set as you'll probably
want quit e a  f e w  o f  t h e

is quite simple. All the data you

then just change the ones you

You can design some really
good characters by making a
block of several UDGs. Even a
modest 2x2 block can look
quite realistic. If you type in
and RUN Listing 3 you'll get a
tank.
By using several UDGs to
represent an object you can get
reasonable animation. You can
really make a  ball look  as
though i t ' s  bounc ing b y
squashing it as it hits a wall, or
you can make a funny little man

Listing 4 — you'll see what I

shows you how to
clarify control
characters by inserting
'REM' lines into BASIC
programs.
HAVE Y O U  EVEN T RIED
typing i n  listings o f  BASIC
programs f o r  yo u r C o m -
modore 64 involving long lines
or cursor controls and colour
commands? I f  so, you will
probably know that decipher-
ing t h e  graphic symbols
representing these controls
can be very difﬁcult. This is a
real problem for programmers
producing programs f o r
publication in magazines such
as this one, as the program will
have to be typed in from a
printed listing. O ne way of
overcoming this problem is to
document your programs with
'REM' statements, explaining
the control characters used.
Here is a simple machine
code routine Which inserts
'REM' lines i n  an y BASIC
program h eld  i n  memory
immediately before every line
that contains the line:
1020 PRINTISHELLO":?
Then a  line 1019 is inserted
showing that a 'cursor right'
and a 'cursor down' character
are to be printed
1019 REM CUD-CUR
1020 PRINTIMIELLO":?
The dash between the twc
commands shows that t h e
control characters are next to
each o t h er. I f  t h ey a r e
separated, then a  space is
printed, e_g_:
1019 REM CUR-CUD-RED
'THERE M O W S
This means that 'HELLO' is
printed in red, 'THERE' in black
and 'YOU' in reversed green.

To execute the  routine, ﬁrst
load o r  type i n your BASIC
program then type 'SYS 49152'
or 'SYS 12*4096' and wait a few
moments (depending on the
length of your program). When
'READY' appears, y o u  c a n
RUN. re-SAVE or LIST your new
program. If the BASIC text has a
line 2 0  containing c ontrol
characters but also has a line 19,
then another line 19 is inserted;
the operation of the program is
unaffected.

David Crisp examines 
r
Practicalc, Practiﬁle and UM
Inventory 64, three pieces of
business software from the
Computer S o f t w ar e. . . 0o
Association for your
Commodore 64.
COMPUTER SOFTWARE ASSOCIATION
has been advertising these for quite a
while now but this is the ﬁrst opportunity I
have had to try them. My ﬁrst intention
was to compare each program with a
similar product from another company
but later I decided to treat them as a
complete but non-integrated package. I
have been using a  spreadsheet a lot
recently and so Practicalc was the one I
dealt with ﬁrst.
The packing leaves a lot to be desired.
It is a ﬂimsy box which suffers greatly in
the post. This type of packing seems to be
the type with all of the programs from
C.S.A. Even when stored under normal
circumstances at home the box is easily
crushed and soon becomes more than
useless. T h e  m a n u a l w a s  q u i t e
comprehensive and it's  small size is
misleading. It is clearly set out and packed
with information laid out in a clear way
with a good tutorial approach. If you have
not used a spreadsheet before then this
would soon get you going. Lacking in this
manual, as in most manuals that arrive
with spreadsheets, is anything that would
point out the potential of a spreadsheet.
For the novice it is difﬁcult to imagine
it as anything other than an elaborate
calculator which can do things such as
cash ﬂow projections and analysis. When
you start to plumb the depths, however, it
is possible t o  suddenly discover how
versatile the sheet can be. To date I have
found no manual which stimulates the
imagination. I have an unusual invoicing
application o n  my  spreadsheet which
allows the to easily raise invoices and
statements for account customers. I can
see at a  glance each account and its
present pos ition. Some crafty pr int
routines giv e t h e  appearance o f  a
standard invoicing program. This is a
function I worked out for myself while
trying t o  justify owning a  powerful
spreadsheet. Enough rambling and back
to Practicalc
Display
Pracucalc seems to load very quickly and
once loaded you are asked how many
columns and how many rows you would
like. The default values are 40r4r25c. For
my own use this is not really big enough
but for many small users it would be
enough. After choosing the size of your
sheet the top left corner of the sheet is
displayed. I cannot really say the display
pleased me as it looked a little bare. The
columns were displayed well enough but
the rows were not marked out at all, and I
had some difﬁculty placing the cursor on
the desired row. At the top of the screen
where I  h a v e  lear ned t o  ex pec t
information such as cells remaining and
memory available there was nothing
except the current row/column and the
word 'PRACTICALC'.
The information there though was
clear on both the 5" colour screen of an
SX-64 and a 14" green screen monitor;
some programs while looking O.K. on
one a re  often almost invisible o n  th e
other.
Standard practice
As would be expected on a sheet, full
mathematical functions are available for
use such as LOG, EXP, ABS, SQR etc, plus a
few extra ones such as AVG (for ﬁnding
the mean average f o r  a  range o f
numbers), MAX AND MIN (for ﬁnding
maximum and minimum values over a
range) and COU (for ﬁnding the number
of entries in  a  range). This is only a
selection of the possibilities which are
available. O n c e  y o u  h a v e  b e e n
introduced to a few of the functions you
are led into a tutorial to show the possible
use of the sheet.
Overshoot
I am a great believer in working through a
manual and this one was no exception. I
entered up the information as instructed
and soon felt I was 'alien zapping'. The
repeat rate on the cursor keys was far too
fast and trying to home in on a box was as
hard as getting the last alien on an invader
game. It was at this point I stopped for
coffee. A series of short stabs at the key
soon enabled me to get around the sheet.
The column numbers on Practicalc are at
the bottom of the screen and on all the
other sheets I have used they are to be
found at the top. It took some time to get
used t o this but with practice I soon
mastered it. Pressing function keys soon
enabled me to bring up the option menu.
This is fortunately fairly standard and as
with most sheets a  single key press
enabled m e  t o  clear, resize, delete
(column/row), format etc. As  usual,
commands could refer to the individual
=

S o f t w a r e
cell, row, column, or to the sheet as a
whole. It is possible to set the display up to
show integers only, text, numerics to two
decimal places and so on. To enable you
to enter formulae faster there is the
replicate function. This allows you t o
repeat a cell's formula across the sheet or
down according to the range you specify.
It would appear to be a vital function but
one whic h i s  n o t  present o n  a l l
spreadsheets.
Pictures
A nice extra with this sheet is the ability to
display sets of ﬁgures graphically. As
spreadsheets tend to contain a large
amount of numeric data it is nice to be
able to display a whole row or column as a
bar chart in order to get an overall picture.
To chart a set of numbers with Practicalc
was very easy indeed and quick. You have
the choice of displaying in low or hi-res
graphics which means a bar of asterisks in
low-res or a bar of solid squares for hi-res:
simple but it does the job.
Printout
It is possible to obtain hardcopy from the
unit using either a Commodore printer or
the built i n  software interface. The
interface is mentioned in the manual but
there is  n o  speciﬁcation. I f  the
speciﬁcation was there i t  should b e
-
custom built cable. I could get some of my
leads to work and not others, so all I can
suggest is to try before you buy.
Practicalc conclusion
I can't quite make up my mind on this
one. It is deﬁnitely not a bad spreadsheet
but on the other hand it is not brilliant. If
you are a ﬁrst time user and were learning -
to use one I think you would take to it
quite easily. However, for someone who
is used to a spreadsheet I think they may
have a few difﬁculties in getting used to
some of the odd quirks, such as column
identiﬁers being at the bottom. I  am
suffering from a  severe bout o f
indecision. The best thing would be to
have a look at it and decide once you have
seen it .  I  would p u t  i t  somewhere
between Busicalc and Richard Shepherd's
Autocalc.
Inventory 64
From t h e  s ame c ompany  c omes
INVENTORY 64. My comments about
packaging are the same as with Practicalc.
The manual is considerably smaller but
the program is considerably simpler as
well. It is an inventory control system in
the words of C.S.A. and is straightforward
to use even without the manual. It is menu
driven and getting used to it only takes a
short while. It is what I call a preformatted
database and so is inﬂexible but that is all
some users will want_
Capacity
You are able to hold approximately 650
items per disc but there is no reason why
more than one disc could not be used. I
will deal with the program in the order in
which it is discussed in the manual. After
loading, the ﬁrst thing that is required is
that you insert the data disc, Relative ﬁling
has been employed in this program and so
the setting up of your ﬁrst disc will take
some t im e  although, onc e i n  us e,
searching for speciﬁc records is fast.
The ﬁrst menu to appear on screen
gives you the option to exit, zero sales to
date, maintain or  produce reports.
Choosing option one (maintain) gives you
the opportunity  t o  manipulate t h e
records. When entering stock for the ﬁrst
time you will come across the ﬁrst restric-
tion. It is necessary to allocate the stock
item a number between 1 and 650; this
cannot be preﬁxed or sufﬁxed with a letter
or anything else and so a stock identiﬁer
will be a meaningless number. This is lazi-
ness from a programming point of view. It
is possible to use a hashing alogrithm to
produce the record number and also to
ﬁnd it again and the algorithm can be a
simple formula. Any  program I  have
written using relative ﬁles has been
written using a hashing algorithm and so
identiﬁers can b e  precise or  at least
meaningful. Another problem caused by
the lack of the algorithm is that you are
unable t o  use the numbers from 337
through to 358. This again is indicative of
lazy programming, but could be put right
in later versions.
Standard options
All the functions you would expect of a
simple stock control program are there.
You can produce a  re-order list, on
predetermined levels, a price list of all
stock held; a stock list for reference etc.
As I said before, it is a simple program and
on the whole performs well. A nice touch
is being able t o  enter t he unit o f
measurement so it is possible to indicate
whether something is stocked by size,
weight, quantity, and so on. On this one it
is possible to zero all sales to date, an
important feature which has been missed
on a  couple o f  other stock control
packages I have looked at.
Printer compatability
This program is written in BASIC. For a
program of this type, BASIC is perfectly
adequate. The other advantage is that
because machine code routines are not
stashed away in corners of your RAM any
printer interface y ou may  have w ill
probably work. My interface software sits
at C000 (hex) and so worked OK. Printouts
were simple and clean with everything
clearly marked, Total parts in stock and
total stock value was clearly marked and
everything relevant was printed_
Inventory 64 conclusion
A simple program which worked well in
what it covers. It is lacking in a few things,
e.g. the use of stock numbers and it was
not possible t o  perform any  batch
operations so if the VAT rate changed and
your price included VAT it would be
necessary to change each record. It is a
stand alone system and so you must assess
whether it will save a lot of time. I feel that
it lacked a  daily sales printout which
would have made it useful in applications
where a storeman could use it for issuing
parts within the factory etc. With the
addition of these things I feel it would be a
very useful program. I f  y ou were t o
consider buying it then I recommend that
you write down the information you
would want from an inventory control
package and then see if this program
provides what you need. All in all it's not
bad for the price.
Practiﬁle
•
From t h e  adv ertis ing infor mation
Practiﬁle was the package I  was most
looking forward to using. I am a fan of
database management systems and I
spend a  l o t  o f  t im e  wr iting o d d
applications on them. They tend to be
extremely versatile and can usually be
used in a simple BASIC menu driven form
or alternatively programmed to perform
many operations automatically.
As t h e  manual i s  fairly thic k  i t
represented a couple of hours bedtime
reading before actually loading. I would
not recommend reading the manual
straight t h r o u g h  unles s  y o u  a r e
conversant with this type of program as
they can be heavy going and you may end
up quite lost, but as so many database
C

S o f t w a r e
management programs are similar I tend
to read through the manual ﬁrst in order
to see if there are any extra tit-bits that
have not been present on other systems.
The pac k ing a n d  t h e  manual,
unfortunately, are much the same as with
the other  t w o  programs. T he only
difference seems to be the thickness and
the number of errors. My  copy came
with a six page addendum, not to correct
mistakes but to clear up parts of the
manual and to explain possibilities not
explained fully in the manual. Most of the
pages a r e  c o n c e r n e d  w i t h  t h e
tranportation o f  ﬁles and data fr om
Practicalc into Practiﬁle and vice-versa.
This indicates that s ome degree o f
integration is possible between the two
programs and other sequential ﬁles. Full
marks for explaining it so well, but could it
not have been concluded in the manual as
loose pages are so easily lost.
In use
This is  only  a  review and not a full
length depth trial I  w ill only  point
out the main features of this package. If
you would like to ﬁnd out more about
what these packages are capable of and
how they can be used then it may be
worth reading a couple of the many good
books which are available on database
management systems.
After loading, the ﬁrst thing I noticed
was the constant need to change discs.
From reading the manual I realised there
would be a need to change discs but did
not fully appreciate just -
need would arise.
As a  simple test I  decided t o  set
up a  fairly basic ﬁle whic h would
enable me to store my ever increasing
stock o f  software. I  wanted s ome
degree o f  mathematical calculation
regarding total values etc and the ability
to search according t o  program type.
Practiﬁle does all this as I expected it
would but to be honest the way it did it
was dismal. The screen displays and
prompts were tatty and simply seemed to
scroll up as you went further through the
format routines. I found myself having to
draw what I wanted on paper and then
translate this into a form that Practiﬁle
could understand. I seemed to be relying
a lot on memory regarding what I had
already put in and if I had made a mistake
it required going through each ﬁeld
deﬁned and conﬁrming that each one was
alright.
Menus were comprehensive but their
layout was basic to say the least and
throughout using it I constantly had the
feeling that I was testing a program to see
if it was functioning OK before sending it
back t o  b e tidied u p  and presented
properly. Unﬁnished is probably the best
way of describing my feelings about this
program.
Plenty of space
E
miserly use o f  ﬁlespace. It's capacity
seemed endless w it h a n  advertised
number o f  3800 ﬁles  p e r  rec ord.
Obviously a  record has t o  b e  o f  a
reasonable size in order for that many
records to be stored but by  anyone's
standards some impressive crunching has
been employed.
You have a choice of ﬁling methods
(sequential or relative) and depending on
the type of ﬁle you desire the speed of
operation will change: a  nice feature
which c ould b e  employed o n  other
databases. Relative ﬁles are fast but if the
records you have are small enough to ﬁt
into RAM then obviously searching and
sorting etc are much faster. Despite my
criticisms, its design features such as this
are impressive. That is one of those small
things that make a complete read of the
manual worthwhile.
It is possible to generate virtually any
type of report from your records and this
is fairly easy to do.
Printing
There i s  a  section concerned w it h
customising Practiﬁle whic h resaves
certain information back to the program
disc; these parameters are used each time
you use PRACTIFILE. I t  covers screen
paper and ink colours, whether you are
using two single drives or dual drives etc.
and the type of printer you are using. As
before, I found that some interfaces would
work and others would not and so I am
afraid I can only (once again) suggest that
you try before you buy.
Another feature of Practiﬁle is the
facility for using a cassette. I could not try
this as I use an SX-64 but, for long term
archival storage of sequential data, tape is
ideal as it is fairly safe and very, very
cheap. Again this is one of those little
things that are changing my opinion of
Practiﬁle.
Yet another of those important but
often neglected little things is the ability
to batch ﬁle. If you are entering a lot of
data even random ﬁling seems to take a
long time and you are soon conscious of
the delay between ﬁnishing an entry and
being able to start another one. Once
again, Practiﬁle saves the day. If batch
entry is chosen, the data that you type in is
temporarily stored in RAM and, at the end
of entry, it is organised and stored into a
random ﬁle. I t  is  surprising just how
much time this can save.
Practiﬁle conclusion
I am still a little numbed at the number of
times I needed to change discs and totally
anaesthetised b y  t h e  'grotty' screen
display but, before all y ou Practiﬁle
devotees have me hanged, drawn and
quartered, may I add that I think this
program is very good: the things I have
covered in 'bits and bobs' make all the
difference. Although I will continue to
feel that this program could be greatly
improved, it  is, without any doubt, a
workhorse. I  grew t o  like it  and will
continue to use it for some applications.

Your Commodore's
Pries on BASIC MEMO
continues with A.P.
and D.J. Stephenson
studying data and
arrays.
THE WORD 'DATA' IS MUCH
overworked. I n  gener al,
anything which has meaning to
the computer could be deﬁned
as data. However, as far as the
practical p r o g r a mme r  i s
concerned, i t  i s  better t o
consider data as the additional
information required b y  a
program. A program, after all,
is little more than a  set o f
instructions for  manipulating
data so it is almost self evident
that, in most cases, it should be
supplied f r o m  outside. For
example, a  program whic h
added the numbers 34, 568, 243
and 123.45 together  a n d
printed out the result may be of
slight interest during the ﬁrst
run but subsequent runs would
provide n o  further inform-
ation. On the other hand, if the
numbers were supplied from
outside, s o that subsequent
runs a c t e d  o n  d if f e r e n t
numbers, the program would,
in spite of its simplicity, have
some justiﬁcation f o r  being
written. As a further example, it
would be a pathetic waste of
time t o  write a program for
calculating t h e  number  o f
factors in 456. Far better if the
program could ﬁnd the factors
of any number supplied from
outside during a run_ Now we
have d e ﬁn e d  d a t a  a s

information required b y  a
B pr ogr am, it is important to be
aware of the different ways in
which it can be supplied. We
can use the INPUT, INPUT# ,
GET, GET # o r  READ/DATA
statements,
THE BASIC
a.00
The INPUT statement
When a program is running,
the instructions are executed
one after the other at lightning
speed — far faster than humans
can think or act. If a program
requires data during a  run,
there must be some provision
for halting the computer, until
such time as the user of the
program has ﬁnished entering
the required data v ia t h e
keyboard. The relevant BASIC
statement w hic h halts  t h e
computer until y ou feed in
some data is INPUT. There are
actually t w o  forms  o f  this
statement, depending o n
whether a prompt message is to
be displayed on the screen or
riot. The syntax of the simpler
form is
INPUT variable
INPUT is the BASIC keyword
and must be followed by  a
variable name o f  your own
choice. For example, suppose
we write the line:
100 INPUT A
The computer will halt at line
100 and outputs the character
'?' to the screen accompanied
by the winking cursor. When
you have entered suitable data
and pressed RETURN, the data
will be placed in the variable
named A and the computer will
resume its high speed progress.
If the data is unsuitable, an
appropriate error message is
displayed. T h e  commonest
cause of error is when string
data is  entered instead of a
number, i n  whic h case the
somewhat c r y p t ic  e r r o r
message 'REDO FROM START'
will appear on the screen. If
strings are to be entered, the
variable mus t b e  a  s tring
variable such as INPUT AS. It is
worth remembering here that
numbers are accepted into a
string v ar iable ( bec aus e
numbers are included in the
deﬁnition of strings), numeric
variables will accept no other
characters but numbers. If the
operator happens t o  press
RETURN before entering data,
any original value which the
variable may have had is still
preserved. I t  is allowable to
enter many data items at a time
into d if f e r e n t  v ar iables ,
providing they are all separated
by a comma. For example:
1
100 INPUT A,DF
1
You e n te r t h e  A  data ﬁrst,
followed by RETURN, then the
DF data, followed by RETURN.
Although this facility is offered,
you are advised not to use it
very often because it could be
confusing to the operator. It is
far better t o use a seperate
INPUT line for each data item.
In fact, we should mention that
the use o f  the simple input
statement described abov e
should be employed sparingly.
A halted program, accom-
panied o n l y  b y  ins olent
looking '?' can strike terror into
the heart of an inexperienced
operator —  remember t h e
person using the program may
not b e  c omputer minded,
What i s  needed i s  some
message t o  accompany t h e
INPUT statement which guides
the poor user. In-other words,
he or she must be prompted.
Because of this, it should be
almost a rule that you use the
following expanded format of
the INPUT statement:
100 INPUT"message":
variable
T
before but this time, a suitable
prompt message is displayed
for guiding the operator. For
example:
1C0 IN PU T "En t er g u n
velocity ":GV
Note that the message must be
enclosed within double tluotes
and that a  semicolon must
separate the message from the
variable. Notice also that a
space has been left between
the end of the message and the
closing quotes. This is  not
mandatory but, if you leave it
out, the data entered will butt
up close to the end of the
message and look messy on the
screen.

although correct in syntax, is
quite daft. For example, if the
prompt is "Enter your age" and
the operator responds with 456
then the accuracy of the data is.
to say the least, suspicious. The
computer will accept i t  o f
course, because it is naive and
quite incapable o f  mature
judgement. I t  is u p  t o the
programmer t o  include"
validation checks on all data
received from the keyboard
The best place f o r this is
immediately, or at least soon,
after the INPUT statement. We
will take the age query as an
example of a validation check:
500 I  NPUT"ENTER YO UR
AGE ";AG
510 IF AG > 120 OR AG < 2
THEN GOTO 500
Line 510 would reject ages
greater than 130 or less than 2.
These limits are naturally up to
the programmer to decide but
it is hardly likely that a child less
than two years old, however
precocious, w o u l d  b e
operating a keyboard. At the
other end of the scale, it is
difﬁcult t o  imagine h o w
someone over the age of 130
would have sufﬁcient strength
left to push down the RETURN
key. However, i t  i s  often
desirable for the program to
include an escape clause. For
example, it may be that the
operator may want to see what
happens if he was 131 years old
— a kind of digital peep into
the future. To cater for such
awkward individuals, t h e
previous -example could b e
modiﬁed as follows:
500 I  NPUrENTER YO U R
AGE ";AG
510 IF AG>= 2 AND AG<= 130
THEN GOTO 540
520 INPUT"ARE YOU SURE
Y/N) ";KS
530 IF KS < >"Y" GOTO 500
540 ...rest of program...
This version incorporates the
'Are you sure?" trick. That is to
say, if  the data supplied is
outside the limits, it is ﬁnally
rejected only after the operator
has been given the chance to
conﬁrm or reject it by entering
either Y or N (yes or no). Notice
that line 510 uses the AND
connective in between the two
limits instead of the OR. If you
think this is wrong try using OR
instead and see what happens.
You can get into some strange
difﬁculties with AND and OR.
For example, if a number is less
than 130 OR greater than 2 then
it could be any number within
the range -inﬁnity to +inﬁnity.
This would be a ridiculous pair
of limits, but if we had used
AND instead o f  O R ,  t h e
number is tightly bound. We

OR and NOT connectives in.

operations. In the meantime,
see if you can re-arrange the
program i n  a  better way.
Remember though, if you have
to use more GOTOs than we
have done it should not be
considered an improvement.
The INPUT statement
The normal INPUT statement is
used for entering data from
devices o t h e r t h a n  t h e
eyboard. Data can also be
tared on a data tape or tape

pleasantries. INPUT i s best
treated later in the series under
the heading of tape and disc
ﬁles.
The GET statement
The INPUT statement is used
for entering o n e o r  more
characters from the keyboard,
the RETURN key being used to
inform the computer that no
more are to follow. The GET
statement is different. It is used
to enter a single character and
does not require the RETURN
key. As soon as we press a key,
the character i s  entered
immediately into the variable,
Thus, if we write GET A or GET
AS, any key pressed is entered
immediately into the variable A
or AS. However, some strange
things can happen unless you
understand the action of th
keyboard buffer. This is a smal
memory, capable of holdin
only ten characters. Wheneve
a key is pressed, the character
code of the key is entered into
the buffer. When we use the

GET statement, one o t  t he
characters is  read in t o  t h e
variable, leav ing r o o m  f o r
another one to be entered into
the buffer. If more than ten
keys have been struck without
an intervening GET, the excess

' following lin e  mus t appear
somewhere in the program:
I 2 0 0  READ A,B,C
M
This will read the DATA items
into the three variables in strict
order. That is to say, 30 will go
into A, 50 into B and 0.5 into C.
There mus t n o t  b e  mo r e

written READ A,B,C,D t h e
computer would get cross and

of provoking an outburst is to
attempt to READ the same data

all the data items at one go. We

numeric constants to illustrate
the features of READ/DATA,
there are no restrictions as to
the kind of constant. They can
be simple string variables or
even long sentences and can
be m ix e d  w i t h  numbers.
However, t h e r e  a r e  t w o
provisos. Any strings in DATA
statements must be enclosed
within double quotes and the

example, i f  a  program i s
running and we idly press a
key, nothing may appear to
happen but the character will
have enter ed t h e  b u f f e r
(providing it was not already
full up). lf ,  later on in  the
program, a GET statement is
reached, the character will be
scooped up from the buffer
without you knowing it. If we
wish to use GET in order to pick
up a particular character, we
must inc lude a  small loop
which halts the computer until
the required key is pressed. For
example:
This is an example of a line
which GOes TO itself unless
some criteria is satisﬁed. The
only way for the computer to
escape from the loop is by
pressing the 'F' key. We can
widen the criteria to include
any key by using:
Note carefully that " ", which is
called the null string (no key at
all), must not have a space
between the quote marks. The
computer stays in the loop until

which character. If we wanted
the computer to halt until the
space bar was pressed, then we
would leave a space between
the quotes.
The GET statament
This is used when we wish t
read a single character from
device o t h e r  t h a n  t h
keyboard, such as from tape

postpone discussion on GET
until later in this series.

uses, w e must delve a little
deeper in t o  other ways o f
holding variables.
Variable arrays
Up to now, we have only dealt
with simple variables like A or
AS because they are relatively
easy to understand. The time
has come for us to delve into
variable arrays. You will ﬁnd
these prov ide a  f a r  mor e

expressing variables and well
worth the extra effort required
to understand them. To start
with, let's see what a simple
array variable such as A(n), or
AS(n) if  it is to hold strings,
looks like. The general form is:
I
Array n a m e ( r i u m e r i c
subscript) A I M
For example, w e  can store
something i n  A ( 1  ) a n d
something else in A(2) etc etc.
In fact we can store something
in A(200) if we wish. The array
name is, in this case, 'A' which
may be considered as a blanket
name for a block of separate
data. Each individual item in
the array is  identiﬁed by  a
number, k n o w n  a s  t h e
subscript. We must be careful
to distinguish between A 2
(which is a simple variable) and
A(2) which is the 2nd variable in
an array called 'A'. It is the
presence o f  t h e  brackets
around t h e  subscript which
informs the computer that it is
one element in an array. The
subscript can be any number
from 0  to 32767 but, unless
,  speciﬁcally wanted, it  is less
'  confusing if  you avoid using
the z er o subscript. M o s t
people, ex c ept c omputer
fanatics, like to count from 1 to
n rather than from 0 to n-1. To
get used to the feel of variable
arrays a n d  t o  consolidate
previous dis c us s ions  o n
DATA/READ statements, study
the following few lines which
will read data items into the'
string array AS(n):
R A D  AS(1):READ
$(2)7READ A$(3):READ AS(S)
1000 D A T A  L O N D O N ,
COPENHAGEN, BERLIN
OSCOW
Type this in and run it. Nothing
• appears to happen because all
we have done is to place the
data items  i n t o  a n  array.
However, it is easy to conﬁrm
that something has happened if
we now use PRINT A$(2) in
direct mode — it should print
our "COPENHAGEN". If there
is a long list of DATA items it
would b e  more professional
and certainly quicker to use a
simple loop to read in the data.
For example:
500 FOR N 1  TO 9
510 READ A(N)
520 NEXT
1000 DATA 3,6,13,8,20,7
1100 DATA 450,200,50
When this  is  run, the ﬁrst
revolution of the loop places 3
in A(1), the next revolution
places 6 in A(2) and so on. To
prove it, try a PRINT A(9)—  you
should see 50 displayed on the
screen. You should try to get
into the habit of using PRINT
in direct mode to test what
happens after a run because it

After all,  ther e c an b e  a

and what actually is. If you want
to h u r l obscenities a t  t h e
computer by all means do so
but, in the end, you will ﬁnd it is
s o m e t h i n g  y o u  h a v e

The DIM statement
In the last .
the loop was from 1 to 9. The
loop was deliberately kept to a
modest size to avoid having to
dimension the array_ I t  is  a
peculiarity of any array that the
computer m u s t  b e  p r io r
informed i f  the number o f
elements in  the array is  t o
exceed eleven, that is to say,
the highest allowable subscript
is 10 (this allows for  -the 0
subscript). T he computer is
i n f o r m e d ,  p r e f e r a b l y
somewhere near the top of the
pr ogr am, b y  t h e  D I M
statement, the general format
of whi( h is as follows
!subscript)
For example:
DIM AS(100) will reserve 101
locations to hold the variables
with subscripts w it hin t h e
range 0 to 100. Once an array
has been dimensioned, you
must now allow the program to
re-dimension or  you will get
the error message, REDIM'D
ARRAY. This is understandable
when you think about it. Once
the computer has gone to the
trouble o f  alloc ating i t s
resources for your array, it is
going to be very annoyed if you
later change your mind within
the same program. If you must
re-dimension, you must ﬁrst
clear t h e  computer o f  a ll
variables (quite a far reaching
excercise and not to be taken
lightly) by using CLR.
Multi-dimensional
arrays
The type of array variable we
have discussed s o  f a r  i s
classiﬁed as a one-dimension
array. It is possible to extend
this idea to include arrays of
two or more dimensions. A two
dimensional array  has  t h e
$.4eneral format:
Array name (1st subscript,
2nd subscript)
Alb
I or example, .A(3,4) i s  o n e
particular variable in the two
dimensional array named 'A'. It
is a little difﬁcult to grasp the
computer's concept o f  t w o
dimensions but suppose w e
consider a matrix of numbers as
follows:
I consists of three rows of four
columns a n d  c o u l d  b e
described as a 3 x 4 matrix, We
could then imagine this stored
in an array A(rows,columns).
Thus, A(2,1) would hold the
number 6 because it is in the
ﬁrst column o f  row 2. The
number 8 is in A(3,3) and the
number 5  is  i n  A(1,2). We
shoulu stress that i t  is  not
essential t o  allocate the ﬁrst
subscript t o  rows  and t h e
second to columns. How you
visualise or use the array is your
own choice — the computer
hasn't got a clue what a column
or row is ...nyway.
The following few lines will
read in the 12 data items into a
two dimensional array and
prints them to the screen as a
matrix of 3 rows and 4 columns:
500 DIM A(3,4)
510 FOR R 1  TO 3
520 FOR C 1  TO 4
530 READ A(R,C)
540 PRINT A(R,C);
550 NEXT
560 PRINT
570 NEXT
1000 DATA 3.5,2,4,6,1,0,4
1 0 I p A  TA 7,9,8,1
The inner loop, lines 520 to 550
begins with R ﬁxed at 1 while
the ﬁrst four constants are read
in and printed. The next four
constants are similarly read and
printed but this time with an R
value of 2. The last four items
are read and printed with an R
value of 3. Note the semicolon,
which terminates lin e  540,
ensures that each row of four
items is printed on the same
line. T h e  separate PRINT
statement a t  line 560 is  t
cancel the semicolon effect in
order that the next row starts
on a new line.

IF YOU LIVE OUTSIDE A LARGE TOWN,
the chances are that you do not have a
shop close-by which specialises solely in
home micros. However, you can probably
buy micros, peripherals and software
from your nearest dealer who will be
either one of the national chainstores or a
shop w hic h s ells  c omputer related
products as an extension to its existing
business, normally, a n  audio/v ideo/
electrical shop.
In many towns and villages, it is unlikely
that a 'computer-only' shop would be a
viable economic proposition so, by selling
computers as a 'sideline', the shop may
increase its turnover by attracting new
customers. It also enables computer users
to purchase equipment without having to
travel long distances.
Despite this being a godsend to a lot of
people, t his  system entails obvious
disadvantages. T h e  mos t c ommon
problem stems from asking an assistant,
who may be as much a computer novice
as yourself, for advice on buying or using a
computer. In some cases, you may be
given incorrect or, as once happened rn
my case, very dangerous information.
In my early computing days„ I wanted
to control my domestic lighting system
with the computer: fortunately, I had a
good idea of what I could and could not
do but, when I asked for a little extra help
at a shop that professed to be 'expert' in
these matters, I was advised to connect
the user port direct to the 240v mains.
Needless t o  say, had I  followed their
advice, I would not be here to tell the
story.
Staff training in  shops is gradually
improving. The large chainstores, on the
whole, prov ide basic b u t  important
training in computer sales and use. Gone
are the days when, if you asked about
'resolution the staff wondered why you
were inquiring about their plans for the
new year!

vast majority of its business.
Minehead Radio received its  ﬁrst
computer t e n  m o n t h s  a g o  —  a
Commodore 64. Suppliers were rapidly
found and, very soon, the whole back
portion of the shop was taken over by
computers. I t  stocks a wide range of
machines including the 64 and the VIC 20
and a corresponding amount of software.
Obviously, it is unwise for a shop in the
outback to stock too many copies of each
title as sales per copy are fairly small.
Printers, a wide range of ﬂoppy discs and
monitors are also stocked by the shop; it is
also their policy to stock many items that
might be difﬁcult to obtain outside the
larger towns. For example, how many
shops do you know where Commodore
printer interfaces may be bought off the
shelf — eertainly not many in Somerset?
A large comprehensive school lies
within walking distance of the school.
Come 4.00 o'clock, it is difﬁcult to get near
the shop as children ﬁle through its door
in their eagerness to try out the latest
game.
Minehead Radio is usually successful
in sorting out its customers problems.
Graham Lawrence, the ﬁnancial director
of t h e  company is  becoming mor e
conversant with each computer. He says
"It is easy to get familiar with our other
lines such as videos, T.V.s etc but, as each
computer c omes  o u t  o r ,  a s  n e w
peripherals hit the market, it is easy to ﬁnd
you are devoting all your time just to
keeping up with what is available and
that's without the constant release of new
software".
Another problem confronting small
retailers is the relatively short shelf life of
many o f  the games. Graham states:
"When we hear that a new release is
available, it is very difﬁcult to assess the
number of units to stock as it is easy to ﬁnd
you have over ordered and, just a few
weeks later, you are left with a box full of
'dead' games. Apart from that it is obvious
that a lot of copying goes on and this has
an obvious effect on the number of sales
per game. Copying is a problem and the
people who are copying are only doing
themselves out in the long run. If a simple
way o f  making programs 'copyproof'
could be found and our sales increased,
we would obviously be able to take on a
wider range of software".
From the conversations I overheard
when I was in the shop, it is obvious that
copying amongst friends is a common
practice.
All muck in
Nobody i n  Minehead R adio deals
ex c lus iv ely  w i t h  t h e  c o m p u t e r
department. Andrew Jordan and Keith
Middleton, who are usually found in
the v an delivering I.V,s, videos and
microwaves, often have to turn their
hands to loading and demonstrating the
latest releases. While they haven't got the
time to become experts in this job, Andy
and Keith have had Commodore 64s at
home in order to learn the basics.
Kate Broderick is responsible for look-
ing after the main computer system in the
back room. She too shows a keen interest
in home micros but, again, she faces the
problem of not having enough time to
keep u p  w it h  t h e  h o me  computer
department,
"Everybody in the shop has to muck in
when things get hectic ', says Graham
Sizer, the director. "It is obviously not the
best arrangement but we can usually sort
out most problems that arise".
Hard to get
From talking to the two Grahams, it is
obvious that difﬁculties arise in the shop
due to the unreliability of supplies. "Take
last Christmas", remarks Graham Sizer,
"Commodore 64s wer e available i n
abundance, unlike other machines, but it
was nearly impossible to get a cassette
unit. We  were stuck with unsaleable
computers. It was possible to get the 1541
drives but how many parents could afford
to buy their children a 64 and a disc drive
in one go?

Pete. w h o  works i n  t h e  service
department makes similar comments
about the components: "I could service
most o f  the machines w e have here
but the supply of I.C.s is so irregular it is
very, v er y  difﬁc ult t o  maintain a n
adequate stock".
The h o m e  computer industry i s
relatively new and still sorting itself out
but, what annoys the two Grahams more
than a n y t h in g  i s  t h e  w a y  t h a t
manufacturers and distributors seem to
'dump' the small retail outlet in favour of
the large multiples when things get short
or at peek times like Christmas, "There
have been times when we have not been
able to get any computers at all. It gives
the impression that we are not doing our
iob properly".
Up to the ceiling
At t he rear o f  the shop, where the
computers live, it was easy to see that
space is a problem. The software was
displayed from ﬂoor to ceiling and, when
the shops gets very busy, it is easy to lose a
considerable amount of stock through
shoplifting.
"Not any more", Graham Sizer tells
me, "We did notice that quite a lot of
stock was disappearing but we now have
closed circuit T N .  _ I t  does have a
deterrent effect as losses have dropped
considerably since it was installed".
Putting the 64 to use
Down at Minehead Radio's video library,
a few hundred yards away from the main
shop, Ron Fitzer is  concealed under
a pile of video tapes. Ron says: "We have
got about 1500 tapes at the moment and
that number is increasing all the time. We
do need to keep some type of inventory in
order to get stock values etc so we are
going to use a Commodore 64. I haveone
at home and use it a lot and I know that it is
capable of doing all that I require."
While talking to Ron, it also became
apparent that using the 64 and a piece of
software such as Superbase, he should be
able to keep an eye on which titles and
types are most popular- With a good
member list and a video list, it should also
be easier to keep members informed.
Minehead Radio seems to be investing
more and more in computers. They are
obviously providing a  service that is
required in the area and seem to be doing
it with a high degree of success. It was
encouraging to see the 64 being used so
much by the shop's staff who have access
to a wide range of machines: Ron, for
example, as secretary of the local rugby
club, is storing the club's records on his
own Commodore 64. This only goes to
show what a versatile machine the 64 is.
Graham is also keen to start stocking the
new Commodore models.
For a small shop, Minehead Radio
offers a wide range of services. Retailing
home micros is obviously a much harde
task than would at ﬁrst appear. It is tim
consuming a n d ,  s o  f a r  a s  c apital
investment goes, expensive. I ﬁnally left at
4.00 o'clock to be replaced by the local

This month we show that
reading can be all fun and
games as Alan Webb assesses
some of the Commodore
games books on the market.
THE MAJOR PROBLEM ENCOUNTERED
by new-comers to computing when they
ﬁrst get their computer is " O K ,  what
do I do with it". Quite understandably a
ready written game or other program to
type in  is  what they really need. I n
response to this requirement, there has
been a veritable ﬂood of books providing
games listings onto the market. Here is a
small selection of such publications.
Book Title: Winning games on the
Commodore 64
Authors: T.P. Barrett and
S.W. Colwill
Publisher: Ellis Horwood Ltd.
Price: £5.95
From the title of this book, it isn't very
clear whether  t h e  b o o k  prov ides
"winning games" or whether it intends
to help you win games. A quick scan of
its contents shows that the book has a
little more than the others of its genre_
There are in fact two main sections, the
second containing 21 reasonable albeit
unexceptional games.
The most exciting bit is the ﬁrst section
which gives a good
the 64. The areas covered include BASIC,
simple animation, outputting information
to screen, Boolean operators, us er
deﬁned graphics, sprites, joysticks
routines and sound. The treatment of the
subject matter was fair giving a good fund
of information for  the beginner. The
section on sound was the exception in
that it as was short and almost of no value
at all. I got the impression that the authors
preferred the graphical side of the 64. The
chapter on the use of joysticks was of
some value in as much that a machine
code routine is provided for the scanning
of the joysticks. This routine was in fact
used in many of the games in section 2.
On the whole the section is probably
marginally better than the user's guide
supplied with the 64.
The games listings provided were
mainly "arcade" type games with the odd
educational program. The instructions or
E
games were generally mediocre. I noted
with some surprise that simulation or
adventure games were included_
Overall, a rather disappointing book
which falls badly between a games book
and a user's guide and isn't really any
good for either purpose.

Book Title: 411/2 Fun projects for
your Commodore
Author: D. Disharoon & H. Kohl
Publisher: Res ton Publishing
Company
Price: $6.95
This book is more of a variety of things to
do rather than games to play and seems to
be aimed at the younger end of the
beginners market. The book is split into
six sections covering w o r d  games,
number games, I Q  exercises, strategy
puzzles, music programs and utilities. To
my view, the strength of many of the
routines given is that apart from being
used as they stand, they can be used as a
rich source o f  ideas and hints  o n
programming techniques.
The most notable routines are a word
search generator, a simple database, a tiny
word processor, and several amusing
puzzles. All programs had introductory
texts describing t h e  program a n d
giving some indication on its operation.
If you want to simply play mindless
zapping games, this book is not for you. If,
on the other hand, you want to use the 64
and exercise your mind and programming
skills, this book is a good starting point.
Book Title: Games Commodore
64 computers play
Authors: Robert Young & Roger
Bush
Publisher: Addison-Wesley
Price: €6.95
At 179 pages, this book was one of the
beeﬁer of this collection. On opening the
book it is pleasant to note that the book is
split i n t o  dis c rete sections, eac h
containing games of a particular type. (As
the title indicates, this is a game only
book).
Section one contains the ubiquitous
"Arcade" games. As  expected these
compromise the usual space, chase and
race types. A nice touch is that a number
have b o t h  k ey board a n d  joy s tic k
options. Overall a  fair  variety which
should offer something of interest to most
people.
Next come the simulations. Four such
programs are given representing the main
types. First there is a space adventure
which, whilst being tolerably short, is
reasonably challenging. Two of the games
are of the "what if' genre where you
change a number of parameters and hope
that the result is correct. These games
enable you to run a farm or control the
Roman Empire. Finally, there is a war
game simulating the Battle of Britain.
Last come the ''mind games" in which
you must try to think faster than a 6510.
These games include 3 D  noughts &
crosses, Reversi, a n d  N im .  N o t  a n
inspiring collection b u t  good honest
staple stuff.
Each pr ogr am has  a  piec e o f
descriptive text which not only gives
instructions on how to play the game but
also indicates h o w  sections o f  t h e
programs function. The introduction has
a full listing of the meaning of the CBM
control characters a n d  t h e  graphics
characters; invaluable if you aren't used
to typing in listings.
Generally, a reasonably friendly text
which should provide hours of harmless
fun at an acceptable price.
Book Title: Challenging games for
the Commodore 64
Author: W. A. Roberts
Publisher: Interface Publications
Price: £3.95
This volume presents a varied mix of 16
games. I got the overall impression that
the games tended to require brains rather
than reﬂexes. In fact the majority of the
games were of the simulation., adventure
or strategy type game. The most notable
B o o k s
inclusions were Reversi and Chequers
programs.
Rather an exciting book  which is
hardly better than average.
Book Title: The Commodore 64
Program Book
Author: V inc e Apps Publishing
Associates
Price: £4.95
This b o o k  c ontains  t w e n t y  ﬁv e
programs of widely varying size and type
including educational programs, games
and utilities. Personally, I welcome this
wide diversity since not all of us live for
zapping aliens. Overall, the programs
tend to be more suitable for the older user
and this book is not suitable as a learning
aid for young users.
All programs use BASIC and I note
with interes t t h a t  t h e  author  has
acknowledged speed limitations of the
language by offering a high proportion of
speed independent programs. There are a
number o f  adventure/simulation pro-
grams which, whilst being lengthy, will
give long term entertainment. For the
lovers of arcade type games, there are a
fair proportion of "zapping" games. In-
evitably, however, these games are all
restricted by the use of BASIC.
For those seeking something more
useful, there are several utilities including
an assembler and a renumber routine. I
consider the inclusion of the assembler to
be a signiﬁcant step forward. The program
is quite versatile providing the ability to
assemble, disassemble, save and load
machine code and run the code. The
book is  almost worth buying for  this
program alone.
The quality of the book is good with all
listings legible a n d  w i t h  adequate
instructions and program descriptions. At
the price, well worth a long look.
Book Title: Crazy games for your
Commodore 64
Authors: H. Renko & S. Edwards
Publisher: Addison-Wesley
Price: 0.95
Here we have a very handy little book of
programs of all types. These authors have
found an interesting blend of games and
novelty programs. I  was  particularly
pleased to see routines for the well known
"Black Box " game and a  program t o
generate Escher patterns. Overall there
are thirty listings ranging from a rather
amusing adventure t o  a Frogger look
alike.
A tolerable amount o f  additional
information is given with the programs.
particularly wher e s ome theor y  o
operation i s  r equir ed. O v er all a n
excellent little book which represents
good value and offers something for
everyone.

Easy to learn, easy to use - something that can't be said of many business programs.
But it's true of all the programs in the BUSICALC series.
BUSICALC 3 can handle all sorts of jobs - budgets, expenditure analysis, stock lists,
price lists, and product costing are just a few of the possibilities. Three-dimensional
formulae automatically access data stored on disk, so that you can easily pull
together information from several different sheets and summarise or manipulate it.
It's simple to transfer data to other programs such as Easy Script. And you can use
virtually any printer with BUSICALC 3, whether dot matrix or daisy wheel,
Commodore or non-Commodore.
For the CBM 64 and PETYCBM 4000 & 8000 series.
