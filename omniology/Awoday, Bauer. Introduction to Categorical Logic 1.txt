is
a

Throughout,
our

F

this

from

the
ob
jects
C
0
and
the
mor-
phisms
C

are
sets
(as

A

2
C
0
the
class
of
morphisms
with
domain
A
and
co
domain
B
is
a
set.
W
e
normally
restrict
atten
tion
to
lo
cally
small
categories,
so
unless
w
e
sp
ec-
ify
otherwise
all
categories
are
tak
en
to
b
e
lo
cally
small.
Next
w
e
consider
sev
eral
examples
of
categories.
1.1.1

The

no

no

The

called

1.1.3

are
other
nite
categories,
for
example
the
category
with

w
o

1.1.4
Groups
as
categories
Ev
ery
group
(G;

),
is
a
category
with
a
single
ob
ject
?
and
eac
h
elemen
t
of
G
as
a
morphism:

The
comp
osition
of
arro
ws
is
giv
en
b
y
the
group
op
eration:
a
√Ü
b
=
a

b
The
iden
tit
y
arro
w
is
the
group
unit
e.
This
is
indeed
a
category
b
ecause
the
group
op
eration
is
asso
ciativ
e
and
the
group
unit
is
the
unit
for
the
comp
osition.
In
order
to
get
a
category
,
w
e
do
not
actually
need
to
kno
w
that
ev
ery
elemen
t
in
G
has
an
in
v
erse.
It
su√Üces
to
tak
e
a
monoid,
also
kno
wn
as
semigr
oup,
whic
h
is
an
algebraic
structure
with
an
asso
ciativ
e
op
eration
and
a
unit.
W
e
can
turn
things
around
and
dene
a
monoid
to
b
e
a
category
with
a
single
ob
ject.
A
group
is
then
a
category
with
a
single
ob
ject
in
whic
h
ev
ery
arro
w
is
an
isomorphism.

P
osets
as

Recall
that
a
p
artial
ly
or
der
e
d
set,
or
a
p
oset
(P
;
),
is
a
set
with
a
reexiv
e,
transitiv
e,
and
an
tisymmetric
relation:

^

z

x
=
y
(an
tisymmetric)
Eac
h
p
oset
is
a
category
whose
ob
jects
are
the
elemen
ts
of
P
,
and
there
is
a

is
the

the
unique

An
tisymmetry
tells
us
that
an

t
w
o
isomorphic
ob
jects
in
P
are
equal.

W
e
do
not
need
an
tisymmetry
in
order
to
obtain
a
category
,
i.e.,
a
pr

w
ould

Again,
w
e

y
dene
a

a

h
there
is
at

the

then
the
limit

its

is
G(lim

So
supp

Then
