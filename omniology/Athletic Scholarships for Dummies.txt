About the Authors
Patrick Britz: Pat Britz began his athletic career at a young age, play-
ing youth league soccer. He continued to play soccer and earned a
partial athletic scholarship to attend the University of North Carolina
at Asheville. While there, he was a four-year starter and ended his
playing career as the second all-time leading scorer in school history
and the leading goal scorer since UNC Asheville went to Division I
(1986). Britz has worked in the world of intercollegiate athletics for
over 14 years, the majority of which he has been involved in NCAA
rules and regulations. He began his professional career as the
Assistant Commissioner for Championships and Compliance for
the Southern Conference and then moved to East Tennessee State
University as the Assistant Athletics Director for Compliance and
Student Services. Britz spent five years working for the NCAA
national office (1996–2001) and was primarily involved in the initial-
eligibility and recruiting process. From there he went on to Texas
Tech University, where he was the Senior Associate Athletics
Director for Compliance and Administration. In August 2005, he
followed his heart and never-ending passion for the game of
soccer and accepted a position with the National Soccer Coaches
Association of America as the Director of Division I Intercollegiate
Programs. Although this is his first book, he has seen the need for
Athletic Scholarships For Dummies throughout his professional career.
Today, Britz lives in Lubbock, Texas, with his newlywed wife, Kim,
their dog, Josie, and their cat, Shortstop. Even though age and lack
of talent forced him to quit playing soccer, Britz is an avid golfer and
sports a handicap of 10.
Alexandra Allred: Alex Allred earned two karate black belts and
was honored Athlete of the Year by the United States Olympic
Committee in 1994 when she was named to the first ever women’s
bobsled team. She went on to become a sports/adventure writer.
Over the years, Allred has had a variety of unusual writing assign-
ments. She test-drove and wrote about Volvo’s Gravity Car, played
as a professional female football player for Sports Illustrated, com-
peted as a fighter (kickboxing), and took a rigorous firefighter
physical — all for a good story. But when coaches began talking
to Allred about her own daughter’s soccer abilities, she began
looking into athletic scholarships. As the author of over a
dozen how-to and sports books, Allred saw the need for Athletic
Scholarships For Dummies. Today, Allred lives in Midlothian, Texas,
with her husband, Robb, their three children, and a variety of ani-
mals. Together, they try to balance soccer practices and games,
horseback riding, tennis camps, karate, running, and volleyball.


Dedication
From Pat: I dedicate this book to Kim, who unfortunately learned
how to be a book widow too early in our marriage; to my dad, who
introduced me to sports and, for some reason, is still a die-hard
Cubs fan; and to my co-author, Alex, who guided me through the
process and showed tremendous patience while I got married and
changed jobs during the writing of this book!
From Alex: I dedicate this book to my family, who endured count-
less phone calls and late-night sessions on the computer, and
especially to Kerri and Katie, for opening my eyes to the book
premise and for your amazing ability and agility on the field. You
are so much fun to watch!

Introduction
W
hen Navy came knocking on Ed Frawley’s door to recruit his
son, he wasn’t at all nervous. He had done his homework.
His son, Nick, had done his homework, too. As a nationally ranked
pole-vaulter, Nick Frawley had been under the recruiters’ micro-
scopes for more than a year, receiving letters and phone calls from
all over the nation. But rather than rest on Nick’s laurels, the
Frawleys went to work, researching schools (both academic and
athletic programs) and scholarships; reading everything they
could get their hands on; and talking to coaches, trainers, athletes,
and parents from all different sports.
Ed Frawley admits that, despite the tremendous research the
family has done, he learns something new each time he talks to
another parent or attends a recruiting seminar. The world of ath-
letic scholarships is a complicated one, with so many rules and
regulations that it very well may seem daunting to you and your
family. If so, you’re not alone. Many families are so intimidated by
the process that they rely on the wisdom of their high school
coaches or guidance counselors.
But when Nick Frawley sat alone, talking to the Navy recruiter, his
father had no worries. The entire Frawley family was familiar with
recruiting terms, rules, and possible violations. Nick was well pol-
ished in what he needed to ask, what he was looking for in a col-
lege, and how he envisioned his own future.
What a wonderful way to enter one of the most important periods
and one of the most important decision-making processes of your
life. Yet Nick Frawley was unusual in this regard. Most college-
bound student-athletes do not share this pleasant experience,
although they could if they just had the knowledge.
You can. In Athletic Scholarships For Dummies, we provide you with
the information to research your colleges so that you can enjoy
this same sense of security and knowledge.

About This Book
This book was designed to be user-friendly. Each chapter should
read as a miniature book on the topic at hand, making the informa-
tion in these pages easy to access.
Athletic Scholarships For Dummies covers everything you, as a col-
lege-bound student-athlete, need to know about securing a college
athletic scholarship. We fill you in on academic eligibility; combin-
ing academic with athletic scholarships; recruiting regulations;
recruiting services; understanding the role of the college recruiter;
the NCAA, NAIA, and NJCAA; self-promotion; working with high
school coaches and guidance counselors; national signing day;
scouting colleges yourself; campus visits; and parent and athlete
do’s and don’ts.
If you want an athletic scholarship, this book is the reference you
need at your side as you try to make your dreams a reality.
Conventions Used in This Book
This book doesn’t have many special conventions, but here are
three you should be aware of:
 We introduce new terms in italics, with a definition that
closely follows.
 Whenever we give you steps to follow in a particular order, we
list them in a numbered list, with each step in bold.
 We put all Web addresses and e-mail addresses in monofont
so you can spot them easily.
When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have
needed to break across two lines of text. If that happened, rest
assured that we haven’t put in any extra characters (such as
hyphens) to indicate the break. So, when using one of these Web
addresses, just type exactly what you see in this book, pretending
that the line break doesn’t exist.
What You’re Not to Read
This book is full of what you need to know and nothing that you
don’t. But occasionally we do go into more detail on a particular
subject than you absolutely need, and when we do, we mark it with
Athletic Scholarships For Dummies

the Technical Stuff icon (see “Icons Used in This Book”). You 
can safely skip these paragraphs if you just want the bare-bones
information.
You can also skip sidebars. Though you’ll find interesting informa-
tion in those gray boxes, they’re not essential to your understand-
ing of the topic at hand.
Foolish Assumptions
As we were writing this book, we made a few assumptions about
our readers. For example, you may be
 A college-bound student-athlete who wants to know the ins
and outs of the recruiting process because you want to attend
college on a full or partial athletic scholarship.
 A college athlete who’s already received an athletic scholar-
ship but who needs help navigating issues like redshirting,
dropped programs, and transferring to another college.
 A parent who believes your kid has a shot at receiving a full or
partial college athletic scholarship, and who wants your kid
(and you!) to be prepared.
 A high school guidance counselor or coach who advises stu-
dents and parents about college athletic scholarships.
Other that that, we make no assumptions about what you do or
don’t know about college athletic scholarships.
How This Book Is Organized
This book has six parts, with several chapters in each part. The
parts are organized based on how the recruiting process works.
Here’s the scoop on what each part contains.
Part I: The World of College Sports
How can you possibly begin choosing a school you hope to attend
if you don’t fully understand what the NCAA Initial-Eligibility
Clearinghouse does or what the differences between the NCAA,
NAIA, and NJCAA are? This section of the book explains scholar-
ship offers, how different scholarships may help you, and where
scholarship offers come from.
Introduction

Part II: Getting Recruited
Getting noticed among college recruiters is critical to getting an
offer. You’ll need to use effective communication strategies when
you’re dealing with different coaches and recruiters — in fact, com-
municating well is key to your ultimate success. You don’t have to
be on a nationally ranked team or break state records to garner
attention. This part helps you come up with a strategy to get your
talent recognized.
Part III: Making College Visits
Before you accept an offer from a specific college, you have all
kinds of issues to consider. Your instinct may be to do back flips
when you get an offer from a major university, but you have to
know what that offer really entails and what it means for you. You
need to know what kind of school is making the offer, what the
school is like, where you would live and train, how the coaching
staff deals with its athletes, and how your academics will fit in with
this recruiting game. This part helps you ask the right questions,
narrow down what it is you want for yourself, and create your own
set of guidelines to go shopping for the best school for you.
Part IV: Committing to a School
Understanding the National Letter of Intent is only the beginning of
your journey into the world of collegiate sports. When and how to
make a verbal commitment to a school, what the long-term ramifi-
cations of a verbal commitment are, and how to negotiate a better
scholarship offer for you and your family are very important steps.
Before you go to college, you want to be sure that you’re happy
with your contract and that you understand what is expected of
you. In this part, we show you how.
Part V: When You’re in the 
Big Leagues: For Existing 
College Students
Not everything goes as planned. Despite your efforts to pick and
choose the best coach, school, or degree, things beyond your 
control can change. This part of the book walks you through each
step of the decision-making process. It also shows you how to
transfer schools properly and maintain your eligibility status at the
same time.

Part VI: The Part of Tens
As its final bow, Athletic Scholarships For Dummies offers some top-
ten lists of recruiting information and questions you need to ask
yourself before making a final decision on your college career. 
If you want a lot of information, but you don’t have a lot of time,
this part is for you.
Icons Used in This Book
To help you recognize certain kinds of information, we use differ-
ent icons to draw your attention. Icons are those little pictures you
see sprinkled throughout the margins of this book. Here’s what
they mean:
When we use this icon, we’re flagging helpful morsels of informa-
tion. These are tidbits that will give you special insights that will
make the process easier for you.
We offer warnings for a reason: They can help you avoid anything
from losing a scholarship or an opportunity to talk to a recruiter to
missing a critical deadline.
This book is chock-full of important information, and some of it
bears repeating. We use the Remember icon to remind you of a
procedure, ruling, or idea that appeared in earlier chapters or
that’s important enough that you should never forget it. Think of
the “Remember” paragraphs as your coach watching over your
shoulder, reminding you of the rules and proper form.
When we get a little technical, providing more detail than you
absolutely need, we flag that info with the Technical Stuff icon. You
can skip these paragraphs if you want — or you can read them and
get even more insight into the topic at hand.
Where to Go from Here
You can dive into this book anywhere you want, using the table of
contents and the index to find exactly what you need. Or you can
start with Chapter 1 and read straight through to the Part of Tens.
How you use this book is up to you.
If you’re early in your high school career, and you don’t know
much about athletic scholarships except that they’re out there,
Part I will be right up your alley. If you’re starting to get recruited,
Introduction

and you’re not sure how to handle the phone calls and letters, Part
II is your ticket. And if you’re already a college athlete, Part V is
where you’ll want to begin.
Although you’ll never have a guarantee in the world of sports and
academics, this book is your guide to making the right decisions.
We hope that you and your family will read this book together, take
notes, and begin the process today. Good luck!

for college recruiting; and what you may expect from an
athletic scholarship. This is your guide to getting started

T
he world of college athletics — however seemingly vast and
organized — is actually a relatively small community filled with
confusing information, regulations, and rumors. There are myths —
like the one that says billions of dollars of scholarship money are
wasted because no one claims them, or the one that says every
athlete who gets a scholarship gets a full ride — and there are
dizzying real-life rules.
But don’t worry. Athletic Scholarships For Dummies is designed to
answer all your questions, address the persistent rumors, and ease
your mind about how you should begin pursuing a scholarship.
In this chapter, we show you how to look at scholarships and how
to think about where you want to play.
Don’t worry about what other teammates are doing or how your
cousin Joey got a full scholarship. We want you to begin thinking
about your future, considering your assets, and making the moves
that are best suited for you.

Sorting Through Scholarship
Opportunities
If you know where to look, there is money to be found. The federal
government is the largest source of funding, but you also can find
all kinds of grants and scholarships available from major corpora-
tions and foundations as well as small mom-and-pop companies, all
of which are committed to higher education.
Although your goal is to be awarded an athletic scholarship, you
can’t reach that goal without understanding where the scholarship
money is coming from, what you have to do to get it, and what
your responsibilities are when you’ve gotten it.
In an effort to raise the standard of education in this country,
Uncle Sam has been a giving uncle, establishing loans, grants,
scholarships, even work-study programs for students and student-
athletes. State governments also award financial aid. And, of
course, both the federal and state governments have vested inter-
ests in the money they award.
Colleges and universities are no different from the federal and state
agencies in one important way: They expect something in return for
the financial aid they offer, whether academic or athletic. Schools’
academic or athletic departments will be interested in you only if
they believe you have something to offer them in return. College
athletic departments want athletes who will lift their programs,
make boosters happy, and help ensure championships.
You need to understand what kind of scholarship is being offered
to you before you sign anything. Chapter 2 shows you what a
scholarship is and what the different types of scholarship are.
Finding the Right Program
Okay, so you’re a top-rated soccer or volleyball player, you’ve broken
state records in football or track, or you’re a standout swimmer or
diver. You show up to all your practices and games, have a great rep-
utation among coaches and competitors, and are widely known and
respected among recruiters. You don’t need to worry about doing
anything except playing the sport you play so well, right?
Wrong. Assuming that all they have to focus on is playing sports
and that everything else will fall into place is probably the number-
one mistake high school student-athletes make.
Part I: The World of College Sports 
10

Think about approaching scholarship searches as you do the sport
you play: In your sport, proper equipment is paramount to your
success. Think about the money you and your family have invested
in shoes, apparel, balls, and sport-specific gear for your practices
and competitions. Think about the time and energy you’ve
invested in practicing, perfecting your technique, and competing.
Think about the time and money your parents have invested in get-
ting you to your practices and games, getting you enrolled in club
leagues, and allowing you to attend select camps. When you’re
going for a scholarship, you have to put in the same kind of time
and effort.
Your educational choices are as wide and varied as are your
choices in sport. But before you can make an informed decision
about what school you want to attend, you have to decide what
you want to achieve with your degree and what, if anything, you
plan to do athletically after you graduate from college. You have to
make this decision because different types of schools offer differ-
ent advantages academically and athletically.
Universities are four-year institutions with a variety of colleges or
professional schools (such as colleges of liberal arts, business, law,
medicine, and theology) and several kinds of degrees in many
areas of study. They offer bachelor’s degrees in arts or sciences
after four years of study; graduate degrees (master’s degrees and
doctoral degrees), which require additional years of study; and
nursing, dental, and medical degrees, which also require additional
years of study after completion of a bachelor’s degree. Universities
are usually much larger than colleges, carry out research, and offer
on-campus housing.
Four-year colleges usually concentrate on one major area of educa-
tion (such as colleges of liberal arts) and offer bachelor’s degrees.
Colleges generally do not support research or offer graduate pro-
grams, but they do have on-campus housing.
Within the category of four-year schools, there are large and small
colleges and universities. Most large institutions participate in
National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) sports. The large,
Division I universities and colleges are the schools that send the
majority of football, basketball, and baseball players into the major
leagues. So, if your dream is to be a professional football or basket-
ball player, you should shoot for attending an NCAA Division I
school.
Many small colleges and universities are superior schools with
excellent academic reputations and prestigious faculty members.
Many student-athletes who are interested in education first and
athletics second attend small universities, which often participate
Chapter 1: Getting the Basics: Athletic Scholarships 101 11

in National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) or NCAA
Division II or III athletics. Many student-athletes also attend NCAA
Division III schools for the opportunities to play in multiple sports
(which is usually not allowed by NCAA Division I schools).
Community colleges or junior colleges offer associate’s degrees,
which typically take two years to complete, and typically do not
have on-campus housing. There are many reasons for attending
two-year colleges:
 Some students are interested in obtaining an associate’s
degree to pursue specific technical careers.
 Some students begin at a community or junior college with
plans to transfer to larger colleges or universities because
they didn’t qualify academically for admission into four-year
schools. They plan to earn the grade point averages (GPAs)
required for admission to four-year schools and then transfer.
 Some student-athletes start out at junior colleges when they
haven’t been accepted by the athletic program at the four-
year school of their choice. They hope to maintain acceptable
GPAs at the junior college, accrue playing time in the National
Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA), and attract the
attention of recruiters from four-year schools.
To understand what the different types of schools mean for you
academically and athletically, and what you need to do to be
admitted to these different schools, check out Chapter 3.
The most difficult chore, of course, is narrowing down the list of
schools in which you’re most interested. You don’t want to choose
a school based on its team mascot, whether your dad went there,
or because it’s where your best friend is going. Finding the right
program requires researching which colleges offer the programs
you’re most interested in, student graduation rates and transfer
rates, academic and athletic success, athletic probation, recruiting
methods, the coaching staff, and more.
For help with researching the right school for you, turn to 
Chapter 11.
Taking the Clearinghouse Seriously
“Nah, I don’t have to mess with that. Coach tells me what I need,
and he didn’t say anything about the clearinghouse.”
Part I: The World of College Sports 
12

Unfortunately, this is an all-too-common response when student-
athletes are asked about the NCAA Initial-Eligibility Clearinghouse.
But if you want to play in the NCAA in Division I or II, and if you
have visions of getting any kind of scholarship, you must register
with and be certified by the clearinghouse. But what is the clear-
inghouse, and why — if it’s so important — might your coach not
stress that importance?
The NCAA Initial-Eligibility Clearinghouse is an agency that offers
certification for prospective student-athletes to become eligible to
play collegiate sports in Divisions I and II of the NCAA. Like every-
thing you do as a student-athlete — the training, the competitions,
the recruiting process, the letters and phone calls — you have to
go through the clearinghouse if you hope to play in Division I or II
of the NCAA.
The clearinghouse is not a recruiting service, nor does it guarantee
that a college will take an interest in you. What it does is review
your academic record to determine if you’re eligible to participate
in Division I or II schools as a freshman athlete (whether you’ve
met the academic and athletic requirements of participating insti-
tutions) and then give colleges the green light to look at you after
you’ve received your eligibility certification. When you understand
and respect the process, you can be sure you’ve taken your first
sure step into the big game: collegiate sports.
Your coach may not have mentioned the clearinghouse to you,
because high school coaches — however wonderful, however nice,
however gifted as coaches — can easily become overwhelmed by
other responsibilities. Most high school coaches or club coaches
hold other jobs. Most high school coaches also teach academic
subjects in school. They’re responsible for dozens of students,
grading, testing, parent-teacher conferences, and school facility
meetings, not to mention games, support staff, and all the other
athletes on your team. The point? You can’t rely on your coach for
all the answers.
Going Through the Recruiting
Process
Believe it or not (and you’d better believe it), just because you’re
the best on your team doesn’t guarantee recruitment or a scholar-
ship offer. Just because you set state records doesn’t mean you’ll
go to the school of your dreams. And just because a college
recruiter is telling you everything you want to hear doesn’t means
you’ll get what’s being promised.
Chapter 1: Getting the Basics: Athletic Scholarships 101 13

Up until the point when you start getting recruited, all the running,
lifting, straining, pushing, sweating, winning, and losing you’ve
done has been the easy part. Again and again, we’ve heard parents
share their dismay at the recruiting process. So many parents had
no idea how exhausting and confusing it is. Many student-athletes
never knew how cold and businesslike recruiting procedures are.
Because they were unprepared, the experience was even more
frustrating. Worse, that lack of preparedness can lead to devastat-
ing consequences.
But you can make your experience a positive one by knowing what
to expect. In Part II of this book, we show you the ins and outs of
college recruiting.
As you begin the recruiting process, you need to:
 Carry a portfolio notebook. This notebook should include 
4-x-5-inch cards on which you can jot down questions you
need to ask coaches and recruiters.
 Have copies of your academic and medical records. Your
medical records should include a detailed medical history on
injuries, allergies, and medical conditions that trainers should
be aware of.
 File and catalog questionnaires you receive from interested
colleges, including the names of recruiters and coaching
staff.
 Begin creating a list of things that are important to you —
and continue to add to it as you go through the recruiting
process. When discussing potential schools, list things that
are most important to you, such as school traditions, athletic
facilities, winning records, graduation rate among athletes, or
geographic location of a school. This list will help you remain
focused as more schools show interest and you research indi-
vidual schools.
 Create a list of pros and cons for each school you make con-
tact with. Include the names of recruiters and coaching staff
you meet, along with your impressions of them. After an
aggressive recruiting period, the names and attitudes of differ-
ent recruiters begin to blend together, and you may not
clearly remember who you liked or disliked (and why).
Making College Visits
College visits come in two varieties: official and unofficial. Official
visits are ones that are paid for in full or in part by the college
Part I: The World of College Sports 
14

that’s invited you to visit, and you can make only five official visits
during your senior year of high school. Unofficial visits are visits
you pay for completely on your own, and you can make as many of
them as you want.
For unofficial visits, be sure to make arrangements ahead of time to
meet coaches and staff and to be able to view the sports facilities
(and perhaps a practice). If you don’t schedule these appointments
ahead of time, you may get to campus and find everyone you
wanted to meet with is away or busy.
Because the experience can be so overwhelming and exciting,
many student-athletes later feel like they were in a haze as they
walked across their first college campus. You can prevent that
from happening by bringing a notebook with you on your visits,
and writing down everything you see and hear. If you’re able to
have family members with you on your campus visits, ask them to
do the same. (But don’t take anyone with you on the official inter-
view.) Your family’s notes and your own notes will help you recall
sites, sounds, conversations, and names of people and places that
you may not remember later otherwise.
Talk to other college students — both athletes and nonathletes.
What makes the school special to them? Ask about the campus
issues that are most important to students. Find out how large the
classes are, what classes are offered in your degree plan, what the
professors are like. Find out what the athletic and dorm facilities
are like and how the team members get along with one another and
with the coach and staff.
Ask your parents or other family members who are with you to
help you notice details like whether the dorms have adequate laun-
dry facilities and what transportation will be available to you. Find
out who will be sharing your living quarters. Seemingly minor
details like these will make a big difference in how you feel about
your college and your dorm room or apartment six months down
the road.
While you’re looking around and scrutinizing the college campus,
you’re being scrutinized by those you’re visiting and those who are
hosting you. How you conduct yourself can play a big part in how
the coaching staff and your potential teammates remember you.
See Chapter 10 for tips on what to take, what to do, and what to
ask on college visits.
Chapter 1: Getting the Basics: Athletic Scholarships 101 15

Committing to a School
Committing to play sports at a school is a huge step — a life com-
mitment. For this reason, you need to refer to your notes and prior-
itize your list when deciding on a school.
Rank the schools you’re considering. If your first choice makes an
offer, you’ve made your choice. But in most cases, the third or
fourth school on your list will make the first offer, leaving you to
agonize about what to do. (“Do I wait for a better offer and risk
losing this one?”)
The answer lies in your notes. Ask yourself the following questions:
 What is it you want and expect from this school?
 What did you like most about the team and coaching staff?
 What did you think of the academic department where you’ll
do the majority of your coursework?
 What can you offer this school?
 What do the academic and athletic departments expect from
you? Are their expectations reasonable?
 How much you are willing to give to go to a specific school?
Are you willing to ride the bench and see almost no playtime
just to be able to say you went to a certain school? If not, and
if you have no realistic chance of playing, pass on these
schools. Take them out of your ranking.
If you’ve ranked a dream school because of its image or status,
giving little consideration to what it may offer you academically or
athletically, you’ve missed the entire purpose of the scholarship
offer. When a school makes an offer to you, it’s pledging money to
you because it believes you’ll be giving something back. You want
this opportunity to improve your education and to give yourself a
promising career, as well as to become a strong and positive force
for the team you’re joining.
As you wade through the very complex process of college recruit-
ing, you’ll begin to understand why your school ranking system
and the research that has gone into it matter.
Part IV of this book outlines what to do when you’re given an offer:
reading a scholarship agreement, knowing whom to talk to, making
a verbal commitment (and understanding how that verbal contract
can be revoked), and signing the National Letter of Intent.
Part I: The World of College Sports

Staying Eligible After 
You’re in College
What? You mean after everything you’ve been through, after all the
hard work, the practice, the playtime, the recruiting, the research,
and the signing, there are still more tests to come? You bet. Your
scholarship is good for one year. Assuming you adhere to all the
rules and regulations, keep up with your studies, maintain an
acceptable GPA, and work hard and perform for the team, you
should be offered a scholarship again for the following year. And
the process repeats itself a year after that.
If you fall below the minimum scholastic level required for compe-
tition, your scholarship may be revoked — and poor grades are an
easy mistake made by incoming freshman overwhelmed by new
responsibilities.
In high school, you have everything under control. You may be
very confident, popular, and organized. You’re the big fish in a little
pond. But in college, be prepared to be a little fish in a very big
pond — at least for the first year or so. There are far bigger, faster,
stronger fish in the college pond with more academic savvy and
competition to their credit. Your absolute best defense to this kind
of competition is to know all the rules and regulations of your
school and its athletic association before setting foot on campus.
Transferring
After you’ve gone through all that work to choose the right school,
you may find that it’s not everything you thought it would be. Or
maybe you’ve intentionally attended a particular school with the
goal of transferring after a couple years.
Whatever the reason, as you consider the notion of transferring,
remember that the college scholarship offered to you is a yearly
gift from your college. This gift doesn’t transfer with you.
Before you act, be aware of the following:
 You cannot have direct or indirect contact with a coach or
anyone from the athletic department from another four-
year school without the permission of your current school.
You must receive a release — in writing — from the athletic
director from the school you’re currently attending.
Chapter 1: Getting the Basics: Athletic Scholarships 101 17

 You must voluntarily withdraw from your sport and relin-
quish your scholarship before moving forward.
 Talk with your coach, athletic director, and guidance coun-
selor to discuss the option or penalties of transferring. You’ll
have to meet certain legal and financial requirements.
 You may want to request an official letter of withdrawal
from your coach.
 If you’re denied the opportunity to transfer, you may appeal
this decision to a committee made up of members outside
the athletic department.
Transferring is a decision that should not be taken lightly. Be sure
to research and compare the academics and athletics, location,
cost, and personal needs. But also be aware of the different rules
and regulations for moving from one division to another.
Chapter 18 is an excellent resource on the different rules and regu-
lations of transferring.

W
atch any Hollywood sports movie, and the sequence is
always the same: Star athlete faced with a personal trauma
or seemingly impossible living situation displays the grit and deter-
mination of a true champion and makes the winning shot/catch/
kick/throw that wins a national championship, all before the unbe-
lieving eyes of a college scout. The player is carried off the field by
his teammates as the scout rushes forward, determined to have
that athlete wear his school colors.
Only in Hollywood.
In the real world, most scholarships are far more complicated and
much less rewarding than movie scripts would have you believe.
If you envision a university as a house, the athletic department of
that university is often referred to as the front porch, or the first
part of the house that people see or hear about. The academics,
research departments, and other areas are then thought of as the
rooms of that house. A successful athletic program can and does
attract the interest of students who may want to apply to that 
university — even if they have no intention of playing sports. This
is why many schools spend millions of dollars to attract the top
athletes in the country (and around the world) in the major sports
through athletic scholarships.
In this chapter, we tell you what a scholarship is and how it works.
Think of this as the reality TV to a Hollywood sports script. Just

because you’re a superstar doesn’t mean recruiters are standing in
line to hand out scholarships. And when that scholarship does
come to you, it’s not for life — you have to know how to keep it.
Understanding the True Value 
of a Scholarship
The reality is, many students simply cannot afford college without
some financial assistance. This is where scholarships come in.
When you’re offered an athletic scholarship, you’ll have some or
all of the following expenses covered: tuition, fees, room, board
(meals), and books. An athletic scholarship is often worth more
than the actual dollar figure that is attached to it. Therefore, the
receipt of such a scholarship can be a major factor in a student’s
decision to attend a college.
Before we go into the variety of scholarships available, we want 
to make sure you know what a scholarship is and how it might
serve you.
Show me the money!
Despite what you may have heard, scholarships do not grow on
trees. They’re difficult to come by. Not all four-year colleges offer
athletic scholarships. Only NCAA Division I and II schools, NAIA
schools, and junior colleges offer athletic scholarships. Plus, not all
varsity sports at a particular NCAA Division I or II school may offer
athletic scholarships. For example, Butler University (a Division I
school) sponsors the sport of varsity football at the I-AA level, but
the sport is considered nonscholarship, which means none of the
players on the team is receiving an athletic scholarship.
No Ivy League school or NCAA Division III school offers athletic
scholarships — these schools offer only need-based and academic
awards. Many parents and student-athletes automatically eliminate
these schools from consideration simply because they don’t offer
athletic scholarships.
Approximately 5 percent of the student body at large universities
play varsity sports, whereas 40 percent play at smaller colleges. A
large school doesn’t automatically mean playtime or a better
scholarship.

Note: An institution shall not provide more than an equivalent of
60 total awards in all men’s sports other than football and basket-
ball in any academic year.
Table 2-3 provides the maximum number of total scholarships
allowed for NAIA sports. These limits pertain to all financial assis-
tance that is funded, controlled, or allocated by the institution.
This includes athletic grants or scholarships, academic scholar-
ships, leadership and/or performance scholarships, outside schol-
arships administered by the institution, tuition waivers, benefits,
room credits, meal credits, institutional loans, and work-study.
What this means is that in baseball, for example, an NAIA school
may not award more than 12 total scholarships (athletic and
nonathletic) to the players on that team. There can be 25 guys on
scholarship, but the total can’t be more than 12 full scholarships.

The NCAA allows a Division I men’s soccer program to award 9.9
scholarships per year. Not all schools that sponsor men’s soccer,
however, will offer 9.9 men’s soccer scholarships due to budgetary
restraints. The same can be said for several other Olympic sports,
such as field hockey, volleyball, tennis, baseball, and so on. If the
school has a successful football and/or basketball program and
generates large amounts of revenue in these sports, it can allow
the athletic department the opportunity to offer more scholarships
in the Olympic sports, which normally don’t operate in the black.
This is why most Division I schools focus the majority of their
budgets on the sports that produce the biggest revenues.
Using the soccer example, how does the coach distribute 9.9 schol-
arships to his team? Remember: The athletic scholarship can con-
sist of tuition, fees, room, board, and/or books based on the cost of
each of these items at a specific school. So, for example, if the cost
of a full scholarship at a school is $12,000, and the school offers
the full 9.9 scholarships in the sport of men’s soccer, the coach
could distribute $118,800 in scholarships to as many players as he
deems appropriate.
Chapter 2: Defining a College Athletic Scholarship 25

Let’s say a coach has $18,000 worth of new scholarships to offer
for the next year. He could offer one really talented player a full
scholarship ($12,000) and divide the remaining $6,000 among three
other players. The coach could even decide not to offer the full
allotment, saving it for one or two players who are not even on the
market but will be in the future.
Very few coaches will use their entire allotment of scholarship;
most leave some money available every year. During a particularly
good recruiting year, a coach may use a large portion of his schol-
arship money, leaving little for the next recruiting class.
The competition for athletic scholarships is high, and parents and
students must understand they are competing not only against
other recruits, but also against other players who are currently on
the team.
A lot of scholarship money is tied to returning players.
Asking the Big Question: What’s 
a Full Scholarship?
While speaking to Ed and Shelley Frawley, parents of pole-vaulting
phenomenon Nick Frawley, we asked about the full ride. Because
Nick ranked third in the nation, placing first in the state of Texas,
the Frawleys invested themselves fully in the world of athletic
scholarships. As they began talking to other parents attending
competitions, they learned that the myth of scholarship money is
still alive and kicking. You know the rumor: There’s millions of dol-
lars in scholarship money just begging to be given away. The real-
ity is that scholarship money is more difficult than ever to get. And
the full ride? “It’s rare,” agree the Frawleys. “Very rare.”
The full ride
A full-ride scholarship is a free ride, right? It is just as you might
imagine, providing for the full tuition, fees, room, board, and
course-related books in exchange for the athlete’s performance for
four or five years (as long as the athlete keeps up his end of the
bargain and remains eligible).
The reality, however, is that full-ride scholarships are very rare and
are becoming more so with the increased pressure from conferences
around the country in favor of one-year renewable scholarships. As
the number of full-ride scholarships declines, the renewable award
Part I: The World of College Sports 
26

is a viable way for recruiters to recognize and reward student-ath-
letes with the promise of a full ride. It is a one-year award that is
renewed at the end of each school year for the standard four-year
academic/athlete career. The renewable award is a good-faith offer.
In other words, student-athletes and their parents must go on faith
that the award will be renewed at year’s end.
We recommend that you talk to recruiters and other athletes from
the schools you’re considering, and investigate their record of
renewing awards for athletes who comply with the academic and
athletic standards set before them.
It is important to understand that athletic scholarships are
awarded directly by each academic institution, not by the NCAA or
NAIA. Within the NCAA, for example, approximately $1 billion in
athletic scholarships is awarded each year. Although that dollar
sum sounds high, the cost of awarding scholarships is even higher,
mainly due to rising tuition costs. For this reason, schools favor
partial or renewable one-year scholarships because they can offer
more money to more athletes.
The numbers count
Some sports are known as head-count sports; they generate more
revenue among boosters, fans, and the residual effects from major
television deals. Some of the bigger head-count sports for Division
I schools are
 Football (85)
 Men’s basketball (13)
 Men’s hockey (18 full scholarships spread out over no more
than 30 players)
 Women’s basketball (15)
 Women’s volleyball (12)
Because they participate in head-count sports, most of these 
student-athletes are on a full scholarship because even if you’re
receiving only tuition and fees or books, you count as one of the
“heads” toward the maximum limit. For example, if you’re playing
women’s volleyball at a Division I school and receiving only a par-
tial athletic scholarship, you still count as 1 of the 12. Obviously,
the schools with deeper pockets will be able to offer more full schol-
arships in these head-count sports, but for a lot of Division I schools
that do not sponsor football, basketball (and sometimes volleyball
or hockey) are the money-makers so these student-athletes receive
Chapter 2: Defining a College Athletic Scholarship 27

full scholarships with the hope of being more successful and, thus,
earning more revenue for the entire athletic department.
Although the debate on commercialism rages on, the reality is,
with scholarship costs increasing, schools need outside revenue to
further their athletics programs. Again, people continue to debate
which sports should benefit from such revenues and how. In the
meantime, logos, sponsored halftime shows, tailgating events, and
in-game and postgame entertainment promotions — as well as
lucrative television deals partnered with big business such as
Coca-Cola, General Motors, and Cingular — are on the rise. Think
of sponsorship (the research and securing of) as a business deal
for the student-athlete’s future — the more revenue a school can
generate, the more scholarships it may be able to offer.
Some people argue that activities such as these are exploiting stu-
dent-athletes and that the school is making money off the talents
and skills of young men and women. In the end, however, athletic
scholarships are a wonderful privilege for student-athletes and an
expensive proposition for any university. Therefore, athletic
departments are becoming more and more creative about how to
generate more revenue in order to allow student-athletes like you
to earn a scholarship!

Can I keep the scholarship 
the church gave me?
If you get a scholarship from your church or the local Rotary Club or any other organ-
ization, you have to be careful. If the scholarship was awarded to you based on ath-
letic merit, this may pose a problem with your potential school.
For example, a baseball player is given a scholarship from his church, but the
number of baseball scholarships at his school is limited. Thus, this gift may be
counted against the school.
It is not uncommon for a coach to give you a choice: Keep the money or play ball,
but you can’t do both.
Whether you’re given money by your church or the local Rotary Club, talk to your
high school counselor, or if you’ve already decided on the college you want to
attend, talk to the financial-aid office. There is a cap on how much money a student
can receive, and you must abide by the rules.
To avoid any trouble, always be open with your coaches and advisors about any
monies you’re offered. Many well-meaning gestures can land you in trouble if you
aren’t careful.

Riding the Full Four Years
The promise of four years doesn’t always mean four years.
Athletic scholarships are renewed every year and may not be guar-
anteed (in writing) for more than one year. In other words, a coach
may tell you that you will receive a scholarship for four (or even
five) years, but that sort of promise may not be in writing. That
said, it’s unusual for a coach not to renew an award simply because
someone isn’t performing well. Coaches are keenly aware of the
recruiting grapevine, and they don’t want to earn a bad reputation
among good athletes. Keep in mind, though, that coaches can lose
their jobs if the team isn’t doing well, so while you may keep your
scholarship even if you aren’t performing well, your playing time
may suffer.
Coaches have the right to reduce or cancel your scholarship after
the period of the award (usually during the summer). If this hap-
pens to you, and you feel it is unfair, you have the right to appeal.
(See the following section for more information.)
Fortunately, Division I and Division II schools have guidelines that
mandate that student-athletes must be notified by July 1 of each
year whether their scholarships for the following year will be
renewed, increased, decreased, or not renewed at all. If a scholar-
ship is decreased or not renewed, the student-athlete must be
given the opportunity to appeal this decision to a committee made
up of members outside the athletic department. Again, although it
is rare for a student-athlete’s scholarship to be taken away based
solely on performance, the revoking or reducing of a scholarship
can happen for a variety of reasons.
How to keep your scholarship
If you talk to almost any coach in the country, he’ll tell you that it
isn’t that difficult for a student to keep his or her athletic scholar-
ship. Give your best effort each day at practice and in games, work
hard in the classroom, and keep a positive attitude. Oh, yeah, and
stay out of trouble!
Many student-athletes believe that, after they’ve been awarded a
scholarship for the year, it can’t be taken away regardless of behav-
ior, performance, or outside circumstances. This is not true. In
reality, a scholarship may be revoked during the period of award
for a number of reasons, including:
Chapter 2: Defining a College Athletic Scholarship 29

 Ineligibility for intercollegiate competition
 Fraudulent misrepresentation on a school application,
National Letter of Intent, and/or financial-aid statement
 Misconduct warranting substantial disciplinary penalty
 Voluntary withdrawal from the team
If your scholarship is reduced or cancelled for one of the preceding
reasons, you’re entitled to an appeal hearing. However, the chances
of a committee overturning your coach’s decision if you’re engaged
in one of these activities generally fall in the slim-to-none category —
unless there are some strong mitigating circumstances. For exam-
ple, you quit the team because you needed to focus on your aca-
demics so you wouldn’t be suspended from the university — the
coach allowed you to keep your scholarship for the remainder of
the year but did not renew it for the next year.
You can’t accept a scholarship, quit the team, and then continue to
receive the scholarship. Your grades, behavior, and commitment to
the team are all extremely important factors in whether or not you
will receive a scholarship for four or five years — or be dropped
after one.
Unfortunately, injuries are a part of athletics, and sometimes those
injuries are severe enough to end a student-athlete’s career. Be
sure to ask your coach if you’ll continue to receive your scholar-
ship if you suffer a career-ending injury or illness. The scholar-
ships that are awarded to student-athletes who will never play
again due to injury do not count toward the team’s maximum limi-
tations we cover earlier in the chapter.
Who decides if you get to 
keep your scholarship?
Ultimately, the decision as to whether you’ll keep your scholarship
and for what amount is made by the head coach. Most coaches
have individual meetings with players toward the end of the spring
semester and let them know their status. This way, it isn’t a sur-
prise when you receive the financial-aid agreement (or a letter
telling you that you aren’t receiving a scholarship) in the summer.
Although the coach is the one who makes this decision, you have
the power to make it a “no-brainer” decision. If you stay away from
the four ways your scholarship can be immediately cancelled that
we discussed in the preceding section and adhere to the following
Part I: The World of College Sports 
30

tips, the chances of your keeping your scholarship for four or five
years will increase to nearly 100 percent:
 Go to every class unless you have an away game or are sick.
Take a schedule to your professors the first week of class, and
let them know the days you’ll be gone for away games.
 Try to schedule your classes around your practice schedule
as often as possible. Just don’t do this at the expense of your
ultimate goal: to get your degree.
 Show up on time (or early) for practices and games.
 Dress appropriately for practice. Don’t wear torn T-shirts
and your hat on backward.
 Dress appropriately to travel to away games. When you’re on
the road, you’re representing your team, your school, and
yourself!
 Work out on your own in the off season to try to improve
your skills and get in better shape. Talk to your coach to find
out the areas in which you need to improve.
 Stay focused and pay attention during practices and games.
Don’t talk to your teammates about the frat party later that
night. During games, avoid waving to your buddies and family in
the crowd. If you’re on the bench, stay ready to play at any time.
 Keep a positive attitude even if you aren’t playing a lot (or
traveling) as a freshman or sophomore. More than likely,
there are juniors and seniors on the team who went through
the same experience.
 Be respectful of your coaches, teammates, and professors.
As corny as it sounds, treat them the way you want them to
treat you!
Even though there are events that can happen beyond your con-
trol, in which you may have your scholarship reduced or cancelled
(for example, your coach quits, or an unexpected star transfers to
your school), following these tips will make a coach want to keep
you on scholarship and as part of the team!
If your scholarship is reduced or cancelled, the school must notify
you of this in writing and give you the chance to appeal the deci-
sion if you think it’s unfair. If you want to appeal this decision, a
committee made up of members outside the athletic department
(for example, the director of financial aid, the dean of students, fac-
ulty members, and so on) will hear the appeal, and their decision is
final. If you have specific questions about this, the director of com-
pliance on campus should be able to help you.
Chapter 2: Defining a College Athletic Scholarship 31

Defining the Term Half-and-Half:
The Academic and Athletic
Scholarship
Your chances of playing sports at the college level are far less than
they were at the high school level — no big surprises there.
According to the NCAA, high school men’s basketball has close to
500,000 players (150,000 of whom are seniors). Approximately
4,500 freshman positions are available at the college level, which
means about 3 percent of high school seniors will play college ball,
and fewer than that will be offered scholarships.
The good news is these figures do not include the NAIA or NJCAA
colleges, and they don’t take into consideration the fact that a lot
of those high school graduates will not attend college. The sport
you play and the college you hope to attend are both factors when
it comes to scholarship availability. For example, if your grades are
not as high as you’d like, your chances of getting into and earning a
scholarship at a top-notch academic school may be limited.
Further, if you aren’t starting on your high school or club team,
you probably won’t get offered an athletic scholarship at a pro-
gram ranked in the top 20.
Half-and-half scholarships may be a fine alternative to the tradition
full-ride scholarship. Textbooks alone can cost upward of $1,000
per year. Half-and-half or partial scholarships may offer financial
aid for both athletic and academic purposes. Books are not the
only costly expenses at college. Room, board, tuition, and com-
puter fees can make higher education impossible — but a partial
scholarship may absorb one or more of these costs.
Part I: The World of College Sports 
32
Winning the scholarship
Vince Lombardi once said that winning isn’t everything, it’s the only thing.
Somewhere along the line, this became a way of thinking in the sports world — a
motto for young rising stars. But we wonder if Lombardi really meant the game.
Although winning the game is wonderful, exciting, and seemingly fulfilling, earning
a scholarship is the real win. Through your scholarship, you’ve been given the gift
of an education, the opportunities that only higher education can offer, and the expe-
rience of a lifetime. Talk to any person who has been out of school 10 or 15 years and
who’s still paying student loans — you’ll discover the value of a scholarship!

Most important, after you’ve met the agreed-upon terms of your
partial scholarship and played to the satisfaction of your coaches
and specific sport departments, you may be able to negotiate for a
full scholarship after your freshman year.
Scholarships cost money — often, more money than a school has.
This is another reason why your grades are critically important.
Although a school may be able to give you only a partial athletic
scholarship, it may be more than happy to find academic monies
for a second partial scholarship to help absorb the costs.
Chapter 2: Defining a College Athletic Scholarship 33
Discovering the FAFSA
The scholarship you’re offered may not be a full ride, which means you’ll have to
come up with some money on your own to pay for college. How are you going to
cover the cost of tuition or room and board? Start by becoming familiar with the
Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). FAFSA is the form you fill out to
apply for federal loans and grants.
If you want to qualify for financial aid, speak to your high school guidance coun-
selor or go to the FAFSA Web site (www.fafsa.org). Applying for financial aid
may sound daunting, but in reality, the form is short and painless. Don’t let the idea
of applying for financial aid scare you away. You may be surprised by everything
financial aid may have to offer you.

lthough football and basketball may dominate when it comes
to television coverage, there are actually numerous sports for
college athletes. Regardless of your sport, you have many options
for where you can play.
There are three main organizations, and you’ll find benefits in play-
ing for each. But before you can choose, you have to understand
what the different organizations and divisions are about. In this
chapter, we help you start thinking about your goals for college
and after college, which school is the best fit for you, and your
chances of getting into the college you want to attend. All of these
factors will help you figure out which organization to focus on.
Understanding the NCAA
The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is made up of
nearly 1,300 colleges and universities, athletic conferences, and
sports organizations devoted to the fair and equal administration
of intercollegiate athletics. The association’s governance structure
consists of divisionwide legislative bodies that govern within their
specific levels; 125 committees that oversee sports rules and con-
duct championships; and the Executive Committee, which serves
as the highest governing body of the NCAA.
More than 360,000 student-athletes compete each year in NCAA-
sponsored sports. And more than 40,000 of these young men and

women compete annually in the 88 championships in 23 sports
held for NCAA member institutions.
Understanding the rules 
and who makes them
A major restructuring of the NCAA in 1973 led to the establishment
of three new membership classifications for sports: Division I,
Division II, and Division III. Further restructurings over the years
have continued to diversify and decentralize the NCAA, adding not
only more bureaucracy (with more people, more levels, and more
money), but also more autonomy for different divisions.
For example, in 1978, NCAA Division I football divided itself into
Division I-A and Division I-AA so that a Division I-AA football

How it all began
You’ll hear many students refer to scholarships as free money — something that 
doesn’t have to be repaid — and for that reason alone, getting a scholarship is 
lucrative.
The idea of scholarships has appealed to people since the mid-1800s, when Harvard
University created the first scholarship system. Lady Anne Radcliffe Mowlson pro-
vided the funds for a student-loan program in 1840. By 1878, Harvard had the best-
funded scholarship program in the nation. But it wasn’t until 1905 that colleges 
and universities seriously considered the health, welfare, and education of student-
athletes.
The early years of football were violent ones — even by gridiron standards — and
many athletes were killed during playtime. Because there were so few rules, plays
such as “hurdle” plays were allowed: Teams would pick up their ball carriers and
launch them over the opposing lines. Mass-momentum plays such as the “flying
wedge” allowed players to link together in a high-speed play of mass momentum.
In 1905, 18 players were killed in play, with another 140 injured. There was a call to
ban the sport of football, and President Theodore Roosevelt came to the rescue. As
a Harvard graduate, former student-athlete, and fan of the sport, he demanded that
the game be reformed or be banned.
The Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (IAAUS) was formed in
1906, but the rules were not rigid enough, and even greater numbers of players con-
tinued to be injured or worse. In the 1909 fall season, 33 players were killed. In 1910,
the IAAUS reconfigured itself with clear rules and regulations. The new organiza-
tion called itself the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The rest, as you know,
is history.

championship could be added. In 1981, 12 women’s sports were
added to the NCAA championship program, a number that has con-
tinued to grow over the years, thanks to Title IX (a law created to
ensure that men and women are given equal athletic and academic
opportunities). In 1997, the NCAA implemented a change in its gov-
ernance structure that provided more control by the presidents of
the member colleges and universities.
Grappling with the divisions
Each division has its own institutional mission and its own athlet-
ics philosophy. Each division also has its own criteria for member-
ship. The more prominent of those criteria pertain to sports-
sponsorship requirements and the amount of athletics-related
financial aid that schools may provide to student-athletes.
Division I: What it means for the athlete
Of the three major divisions, Division I requires its schools to make
the largest financial-aid commitment and sponsor the most sports.
Division I institutions compete at the major-college level. According
to NCAA by-laws, these schools must sponsor at least seven sports
for men and seven sports for women (or six for men and eight for
women, but not the other way around), with two team sports for
each gender and each playing season also represented by each
gender. Each sport must meet certain contest and participant mini-
mums, as well as scheduling criteria.
For sports other than football and basketball, Division I schools
must play 100 percent of their minimum number of games against
other Division I opponents. If a Division I team plays more than its
minimum number of games, at least 50 percent of its remaining
games must be against Division I opponents.
Men’s and women’s basketball teams have to play all but two
games against Division I opponents, and the men must play one-
third of their games in their home arena.
Division I schools that have football are classified as Division I-A or
I-AA. Division I-A football schools are usually fairly elaborate pro-
grams and must meet minimum attendance requirements in one of
the following ways:
 They must sponsor at least 16 varsity sports, including foot-
ball. This must include at least six men’s sports and at least
eight women’s teams.
 They must schedule at least 60 percent of their football games
against other Division I-A schools.
Chapter 3: College Alphabet Soup: NCAA, NJCAA, NAIA 37

 They must have an average of 15,000 spectators (in actual or
paid attendance) per home football game once every two years.
 They must award at least 90 percent of the maximum 85 schol-
arships (76.5) each year (this can be averaged over a two-year
period).
 They must offer at least 200 full scholarships or $4 million on
athletic scholarships for all the varsity sports.
Unlike Division I-A schools, Division I-AA teams do not need to meet
minimum attendance requirements. But all Division I schools —
whether I-A or I-AA — must meet minimum financial-aid awards for
their athletics program, and there are maximum financial-aid
awards for each sport that a Division I school cannot exceed.
Playing for a Division I school is a big deal. It means playing on
high-caliber teams with high-caliber student-athletes. It very often
means playing a higher-profile sport, such as football or basket-
ball, with a great deal of media exposure. Division I schools are full-
scholarship schools, which means that all individual tuition, room
and board, books, and other expenses can be paid for by the
school. But, of course, this means that the standards for getting
into these schools are also higher than those of non–Division I
schools. (For more information on financial-aid or scholarship
opportunities, see Chapter 2.)
Division II: A viable option
According to new NCAA by-laws, Division II institutions have to
sponsor at least ten varsity sports: five sports for men and five for
women (or four for men and six for women, but not the other way
around), with two team sports for each gender and each playing
season represented by each gender. As in Division I, each sport
must meet contest and participant minimums, as well as schedul-
ing criteria.
Division II football and men’s and women’s basketball teams must
play at least 50 percent of their games against Division II or Division
I-A or I-AA opponents. However, there are no attendance require-
ments for football or arena-game requirements for basketball. And
there are no scheduling requirements for sports other than foot-
ball and basketball.
As in Division I, there are maximum financial-aid awards for each
sport that a Division II school must not exceed. According to
Division II athletics philosophy, Division II member institutions
believe they should provide athletic aid to student-athletes to
increase the opportunity to participate in intercollegiate athletics.
Division II athletics programs are financed in the institution’s
Part I: The World of College Sports 
38

budget like other academic departments on campus. Many Division II
student-athletes pay for school through a combination of scholar-
ship money, grants, student loans, and employment or work-study
earnings because there is not as much athletic-scholarship money
available as in Division I.
However, there are some financial-aid requirements that all Division II
schools must meet beginning with the 2005–2006 academic year. A
Division II school must meet at least one of the following require-
ments each year:
 A minimum of 50 percent of the maximum allowable equivalen-
cies (the maximum in men’s basketball is 10.0, so at least 5.0
that sport and a minimum of 50 percent in three others) in four
separate sports, at least two of which must be women’s sports
 A minimum total expenditure of $250,000 in athletically
related financial aid, with at least $125,000 in women’s sports
 A minimum of 20 total full-equivalency grants (full scholar-
ships), with at least ten total full-equivalency grants in
women’s sports
Division II schools are encouraged to offer as many participation
opportunities as possible in regional competition against other
Division II members. As a result, traditional rivalries with regional
institutions dominate the schedules of many Division II athletic
programs. Because most Division II schools have limited recruiting
budgets and are sometimes not well known outside their region,
Division II teams usually feature a number of local and/or in-state
student-athletes.
More important, Division II members believe in promoting the aca-
demic success of their student-athletes and believe that participa-
tion in intercollegiate athletics benefits the educational experience.
Division III: Dispelling the myths
Division III institutions have to sponsor at least five sports for men
and five for women, with at least two team sports for each gender
and each playing season represented by each gender. There are
very few minimum contest and participant minimums for each
sport. Contest and participant minimums do apply to each sport
used for sponsorship purposes (the minimum of five for men and
five for women that the school has to offer).
Division III athletics features student-athletes who receive no finan-
cial aid related to their athletic ability. Their athletic departments
are staffed and funded like any other departments in the university.
Colleges and universities in Division III place the highest priority
Chapter 3: College Alphabet Soup: NCAA, NJCAA, NAIA 39

on the overall quality of the athlete’s educational experience and
successful completion of academic programs. Division III institu-
tions ultimately hope to graduate well-rounded individuals who
have successfully integrated athletics with academics, who have
integrated into the student body, and who have experienced the
full range of college life.
Division III athletic departments place special importance on the
impact of athletics on the participants rather than on the spectators.
The student-athlete’s experience is of paramount concern. Division III
athletics encourage participation by maximizing the number and
variety of athletics opportunities available to students, placing pri-
mary emphasis on regional in-season and conference competition.

Keeping up with NCAA rules changes
You’ve probably figured out by now that NCAA rules and regulations are lengthy,
detailed, and often quite confusing. They also change frequently, which can be frus-
trating because you really do need to stay on top of the most current regulations
that apply to you. So just how do all these rules and regulations come to be, and
who is responsible for creating them?
All NCAA legislation is proposed and adopted by NCAA member institutions and
conferences. Division II and Division III constituents vote on legislative proposals
at the annual NCAA Convention (held in early January). Division I adopts its legis-
lation through a yearly legislative system. New legislation or changes to existing
legislation may occur only through this process; therefore, a rule cannot be changed
without the proposed change going through the normal legislative process. (To
better understand the Division I legislative process, go to www2.ncaa.org/
legislation_and_governance/rules_and_bylaws/submitting_
legislative_proposals/d1_leg_cycle.ppt.)
Next, proposals are submitted by the conference offices or by the committees of
two different cabinets. The two cabinets are the Academic/Eligibility/Compliance
Cabinet (A/E/C) and the Championships/Competition Cabinet (C/C). The A/E/C is
responsible for reviewing and proposing legislation regarding amateurism, recruit-
ing, eligibility, and financial aid. The C/C cabinet deals with playing seasons,
awards/benefits, and any issues having to do with the national championships.
Proposals submitted by the A/E/C and C/C are then sent to the Management Council,
which is made up of athletic administrators (usually athletic directors and senior
administrators) and faculty athletic representatives. After the Management Council
reviews and approves a proposal, it forwards the proposal to the Board of Directors,
which is made up solely of university/college presidents. The Management Council
and Board of Directors review proposals twice in order to give NCAA members the
opportunity to offer comments and opinions over a three-month period.

The Division III athletics philosophy also strives to establish and
maintain an environment that values cultural diversity and gender
equity among their student-athletes and athletic staff.
Jumping In with the NJCAA
The NCAA (whether Division I, II, or III) is not your only option for
playing college athletics, and it may not even be your best option.
In fact, a junior college may be your best bet. Of the nearly 1,200
two-year colleges in the United States, 510 are members of the
National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA), providing
quality athletic opportunities along with valuable educational and
career experiences.
Junior colleges have some excellent programs that may suit your
career interests. There are two programs for students who are
interested in higher education:
 The transfer program enables you to enter the school as a
college freshman, complete one or two years at the school,
and transfer your credits to a four-year school. As a student-
athlete, you can compete in your sport while obtaining an
education — whether you want to transfer to a four-year col-
lege in the hopes of playing for an NAIA or NCAA school or
whether you just want to extend your education to a four-year
degree (without playing sports at the NAIA or NCAA level).
 The terminal program results in graduation after two years
with an associate’s degree and provides you with the qualifi-
cations to find a job in your field of specialization.
What is the NJCAA?
The NJCAA is the governing body of intercollegiate athletics for
two-year colleges. Its programs are designed to meet the unique
needs of a diverse group of student-athletes who come from both
traditional and nontraditional backgrounds and whose purposes in
selecting a junior college may be as varied as their experiences
before attending college. (If you’re a home-schooled, learning-dis-
abled, or international student, for example, Chapter 4 provides
more information on eligibility rules.)
Like the NCAA, the NJCAA is divided into three divisions:
 Division I NJCAA schools award full or partial scholarships to
their student-athletes. This may include transportation costs
to and from the school once per academic year.
Chapter 3: College Alphabet Soup: NCAA, NJCAA, NAIA 41

 Division II schools also award scholarships, but only for
tuition, books, and fees.
 Division III schools are not allowed to award athletic 
scholarships.
Because a limited number of schools sponsor certain sports like
women’s golf and men’s wrestling, they aren’t divided by divisions.
Therefore, it’s common for Division III (nonscholarship) schools to
compete against Division I and II (scholarship) schools. The sports
that are divided up by divisions (such as basketball and soccer)
compete only against other schools in the same division.
Founded in 1938, the NJCAA now comprises 510 two-year institu-
tions, participating in 15 men’s and 13 women’s sports. The NJCAA
sponsors 50 national championships for men and women through-
out the United States, including nine football bowl games.
Playing a sport in a two-year school
Playing a sport while attending a junior college is really a win-win
situation. Junior colleges generally have an open-door admissions
policy, which means that you probably don’t have to worry about
getting in. So you’re able to continue playing the sport you love
while pursuing a higher education — two important opportunities
and privileges that may have seemed out of the question when you
left high school.
Because you’re participating in structured conferences and maybe
even national-championship games, as an NJCAA student-athlete
you’re getting increased exposure and publicity compared to what
you may have received while competing in high school or at the
club level.
The NJCAA is affiliated with a number of national organizations —
the U.S. Olympic Committee, the American Association of Commu-
nity and Junior Colleges, the Women’s Sports Foundation, USA
Basketball, USA Track and Field, and USA Swimming, to name a few.
Not only do these affiliations allow member colleges the ability to
remain actively involved in issues that concern athletic programs
nationwide, but they also provide student-athletes even greater
possibilities for exposure.
Playing in a two-year college is an excellent way to get the atten-
tion of four-year college recruiters. In fact, many NCAA coaches go
after proven talent by raiding the junior-college ranks each year.
Part I: The World of College Sports 
42

Being eligible to play 
later in the NCAA
The opportunities the NJCAA offers student-athletes for increased
exposure and publicity are exactly what student-athletes who want
to move to the NCAA need. If you failed to qualify academically for
an NCAA institution, your dream of competing in the NCAA proba-
bly appeared to have died. But a junior college can offer you a criti-
cal second chance to improve your grade point average (GPA)
while gaining college credits and continuing to play. It can ulti-
mately allow you to transfer to a four-year school to earn a bache-
lor’s degree and to compete on an NCAA team. (See Chapter 18 for
much more information on transferring.)
Running with the NAIA
The third major national collegiate sports organization is the
National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). The NAIA
represents more than 300 four-year colleges and universities.
Mostly comprised of smaller schools, the NAIA is divided into 32
districts and hosts 24 national championships in sports such as
baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swim-
ming, tennis, track, and wrestling.
The philosophy of NAIA institutions is to view athletics as part of
the overall educational process with emphasis on student in the
term student-athlete.
The NAIA is dedicated to academic achievement above athletic
excellence. It expects ethical behavior from its student-athletes,
and it is committed to scholarship, sportsmanship, and leadership.
The organization has been a trailblazer in providing equal opportu-
nities for all student-athletes.
What is the NAIA?
Just as the NCAA was begun largely because of one sport (football),
the NAIA was originally focused on one sport: basketball. Its origi-
nal name — the National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball
(NAIB) — says it all. In 1937, a men’s basketball tournament (which,
by the way, has become the longest continuous national collegiate
tournament in any sport; see www.naia.org/campaign/history/
history.html) tipped off in Kansas City, Missouri. That small-
college basketball tournament, and the resulting formation of the
Chapter 3: College Alphabet Soup: NCAA, NJCAA, NAIA 43

NAIB, were initially the brainchildren of a group of Kansas City
businessmen who wanted to provide Kansas City–area fans with
exciting amateur competition and to provide small colleges and
universities with realistic opportunities to win a national basket-
ball championship.
But the association’s goals and achievements outgrew its founders’
aspirations, and it became much, much more. In 1948, the NAIB
affirmed its commitment to equality by becoming the first national
organization to offer intercollegiate postseason opportunities to
African American student-athletes. Five years later, in 1953, the
NAIB — which had officially become the NAIA the year before —
continued its trailblazing ideals and voted historically black insti-
tutions into its membership.
With the association’s new name came the addition of national
championships in several sports over the years. Then, in 1980, 
the NAIA moved into its second half-century by revolutionizing
national collegiate athletics again with the establishment of athlet-
ics programs for women, becoming the first organization to offer
collegiate athletics to both men and women. The championship
calendar for women began that year with eight sports, and — 
of course — more were added later thanks to Title IX.
Defining how the NAIA 
serves athletes
In 2000, the NAIA reaffirmed its purpose — to enhance the charac-
ter-building aspects of sport — by developing the Champions of
Character initiative. Through this initiative, the NAIA seeks to
create an environment in which every student-athlete, coach, offi-
cial, and spectator is committed to the true spirit of competition
through five tenets:
 Respect
 Integrity
 Responsibility
 Servant leadership
 Sportsmanship
The goal of this program is to “educate and create awareness of
the positive character-building traits afforded by sports and return
integrity to competition at the collegiate and youth levels while
impacting all of society.”
Part I: The World of College Sports 
44

NAIA schools — among the most prestigious colleges and universi-
ties in the country — provide some of the best educational pro-
grams and some of the most successful placement opportunities in
the nation after graduation, both for jobs and graduate school. Not
only are NAIA schools competitive in academics, but they’re also
extremely competitive in athletics, boasting some of the finest ath-
letes in the nation.
There are many advantages to competing in NAIA sports, including:
 Maximum opportunities to participate in regular-season con-
tests and national championships
 Maximum opportunities for athletic scholarships (more than
90 percent of NAIA institutions offer athletic scholarships)
 Minimum recruiting restrictions (fewer than in the other colle-
giate sports organizations)
 Close-knit communities
 Small class sizes, which provide informal and personalized
educations, allowing students more one-on-one time with
their professors
The focus of NAIA schools is on the education and character devel-
opment of the student-athlete. In fact, if you’re playing sports for
an NAIA school, and you feel that the school or team is not the
right fit, you can transfer to another NAIA institution and compete
the next season without sitting out a year, which is not always the
case at the NCAA level.
Although the NAIA has strict academic requirements, the process
of establishing eligibility is streamlined because there is no clear-
inghouse. Unlike the NCAA, each NAIA school certifies the eligibil-
ity of an incoming student-athlete on its own as long as he or she
has graduated from high school and meets two of the following
requirements:
 At least an 18 on the ACT or 860 on the SAT
 GPA of at least 2.0
 Graduation in the upper half of the high school class

Clearing the Clearinghouse
In This Chapter
 Finding out about clearinghouse eligibility rules
 Qualifying for Division I, Division II, and Division III
 Looking at the NAIA and NJCAA requirements
 Knowing what to do if you’re a home-schooled, international, or learning-
disabled student-athlete
N
ow that you’re ready to begin the process of applying to col-
lege, you need to know the different eligibility requirements
for the different athletic divisions or associations. Why? So you
know where you may or may not qualify and where you should or
should not apply.
Deciphering all this information is no small task. Just as each col-
lege has its own academic admissions requirements, you’ll find dif-
ferent athletic eligibility requirements based on your GPA and
ACT/SAT scores for each division in the NCAA, NAIA, or NJCAA.
You may also find different eligibility requirements if you were
home-schooled, if you’re an international student-athlete, or if you
have a learning disability.
The bottom line is that, as a student-athlete, you need to know
about and fulfill both the governing athletic organization’s athletic
eligibility requirements and the individual school’s academic
admissions requirements in order to be admitted to and compete
at the college of your choice. So pay close attention to this chapter,
take notes, and begin the arduous (but very worthwhile) process
of applying for and being accepted to college. With the information
you’ll find in these pages, you’ll already be miles ahead of the rest.

Discovering the NCAA Initial-
Eligibility Clearinghouse
If you intend to participate in Division I or Division II athletics as a
freshman, you must register with and be certified by the NCAA
Initial-Eligibility Clearinghouse. And, of course, that means you
must know all the requirements, fees, and due dates in order to
register.
But before we get to the deadlines and rules, what is this clearing-
house? The clearinghouse is an agency that certifies prospective
student-athletes as eligible to play collegiate sports in Divisions I
and II of the NCAA. The clearinghouse determines your eligibility
(based on grades, completed core course requirements, ACT/SAT
scores, and so on). Then, when colleges request information on
your eligibility, the clearinghouse makes a certification decision
about you and reports that decision directly to the colleges. In
short, the clearinghouse tells those colleges whether or not you’re
eligible to play Division I or II sports. If the clearinghouse says
you’re not eligible, the colleges won’t spend any time considering
you or trying to recruit you.
Three types of eligibility are possible:
 Certification of eligibility for expense-paid campus visits
 Preliminary certification of eligibility to participate in college
sports (meaning you appear likely to meet all NCAA require-
ments, but you haven’t yet graduated)
 Final certification, granted when proof of graduation is
received
The clearinghouse does not work as a recruiting service, a place-
ment agency, or an admissions office; it simply provides your eligi-
bility certification results to any school that requests information
about you as a prospective student-athlete. The clearinghouse
stays on top of your grades, your SAT/ACT scores, and whether
you’ve taken all the courses you’re required to take for graduation.
If you haven’t fulfilled these requirements, you won’t receive certi-
fication of eligibility from the clearinghouse, and you won’t be
allowed to play in Division I or II.
The clearinghouse is also an important source of information for
prospective student-athletes. From the NCAA Initial-Eligibility
Clearinghouse Web site (www.ncaaclearinghouse.net), you can
Part I: The World of College Sports 
48

get information on Division I and Division II eligibility require-
ments, register with the clearinghouse, and access your individual
clearinghouse records.
Facts and figures
The clearinghouse reviews your academic record to determine if
you may participate in Division I or II schools as a freshman athlete.
Understanding this process and keeping up with the latest initial-
eligibility information are essential tools for making your move into
collegiate sports.
For example, the initial-eligibility requirements for Division I and
Division II incoming freshmen have recently changed, and you need
to be familiar with these changes as they apply to you. The new
requirements for 2005, 2006, and 2007 in Division I and Division II
increase the number of required core courses from 13 to 14. The
new requirements for incoming freshmen in 2008, Division I only,
will be 16 core courses. To understand what core courses are and
where the additional courses must come from, see “Core course
requirements,” later in this chapter.
The SAT and ACT also have made changes to their tests, and one of
the most significant is the addition of a writing component, for
which you’ll be asked to write an essay. (The SAT writing section is
mandatory, while the ACT writing section is optional.) As a result
of adding the writing section, the SAT now has three parts: critical
reading (formerly known as verbal), mathematics, and writing.
Because each section is worth 200 to 800 points, the SAT score will
now range from 600 to 2,400.
But the NCAA has determined that the writing component should
not be required at the present time. Therefore, the clearinghouse
continues to combine the sections of critical reading and mathe-
matics for the total score. The writing section is not used.
Although the ACT is adding an optional writing component, the
scores on the ACT will remain the same. The writing section —
even if an essay is written — will not be used.
You can find more information about the new SAT at www.college
board.com. Read about the new ACT at www.act.org. Also, for
help with the SAT and ACT, check out SAT I For Dummies, 6th Edition,
by Geraldine Woods; and ACT For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by Suzie
Vlk, both published by Wiley.
Chapter 4: Clearing the Clearinghouse 49

Cost and contract information
To register with the NCAA Initial-Eligibility Clearinghouse, you must
fill out and sign the Student Release Form (SRF) — which you can
download from the clearinghouse Web site (www.ncaaclearing
house.net — click Prospective Student-Athletes and then click
Domestic Student Release Form or Foreign Student Release Form) —
and send it to the clearinghouse, along with a $30 registration fee.
This SRF authorizes each high school you’ve attended to send the
clearinghouse your transcripts, test scores, proof of graduation,
and other necessary academic information. The SRF also author-
izes the clearinghouse to send your academic information to all
colleges that request your eligibility status.
Apply for certification with the clearinghouse after your junior
year in high school if you’re sure you want to participate in inter-
collegiate athletics as a freshman at a Division I or II institution. If
you fail to submit all required documents, your incomplete file will
be discarded after three years, requiring you to pay a new fee if
certification is requested after that time.
The clearinghouse registration process is the beginning of your
academic career, and if you mess up the clearinghouse application,
it could nix your chances of competing as a freshman.
Most students prefer to register online. Get a credit card ready,
because you’ll need this to register online. If you complete the
online Web application, be sure to print a copy of your completed
registration form (see the instructions on the SRF submission
screen), and be sure to keep your credit-card receipt with your
files. When you print your registration form, you’ll receive two
copies: Copy 1 and Copy 2. Give both copies to a high school offi-
cial (such as a guidance counselor); that person sends Copy 1,
along with an official copy of your high school transcript, to the
clearinghouse. (This way, the clearinghouse and, by extension, the
colleges interested in you can make sure that you’re staying on
track academically not only for graduation, but also to meet the
NCAA requirements.) Your high school should keep Copy 2 in its
files. After graduation and before your school closes for the
summer, your high school must send the clearinghouse a copy of
your final transcript that confirms your graduation and contains
final grades and credits, along with Copy 2 of the form.
If you prefer to register through the mail or by fax, download the
SRF at www.ncaaclearinghouse.net or photocopy it from the
Guide for College-Bound Student-Athletes, which you can get by call-
ing 800-638-3731. Fill out the SRF by typing or clearly printing your
Part I: The World of College Sports 
50

information on the form. Mail or fax the top (white) copy of the
form to the clearinghouse, along with the $30 registration fee. (The
address is NCAA Clearinghouse, 301 ACT Dr., Box 4043, Iowa City,
IA 52243-4043.) If you fax the copy, you must include your credit- or
debit-card information; if you mail the copy, you may send a check
or money order. Give the yellow and pink copies of the form to a
high school official, who then sends the yellow copy (Copy 1),
along with an official copy of your high school transcript, to the
clearinghouse. Your high school should keep the pink copy (Copy 2)
for its files. After graduation and before the school closes for the
summer, your school also must send the clearinghouse a copy of
your final transcript that confirms your graduation from high
school.
When you give both Copy 1 and Copy 2 of the SRF to your high
school guidance counselor or other official, that official will enter
the proper code for the high school you attend (or you may use
the code lookup at www.ncaaclearinghouse.net). If you’ve
attended more than one high school (including summer school),
your current counselor will enter the proper codes for each school
in chronological order.
If you’ve attended more than one high school, you also must com-
plete Section III of the SRF, listing in chronological order all schools
you previously attended, starting with the most recent. If you
attended ninth grade in a junior high school in the same school
system where you later attended high school, do not list the ninth-
grade school. (If you need to list more schools than space allows
and you’re registering by mail, use a separate sheet of paper. If
you’re registering online and need to enter more than six high
schools, go to the clearinghouse Web site, click Prospective
Student-Athletes, click Registered Student Login, and add informa-
tion for the additional schools on your record.)
You cannot send your own transcript information to the clearing-
house. Only your school may send your transcripts to the clearing-
house. And, for reasons of security, the clearinghouse will not
accept faxed transcripts.
When filling out the SRF, enter all information accurately, including
your Social Security number (SSN) and date of birth. This informa-
tion must match exactly other data the clearinghouse receives for
you (like high school transcripts and requests from colleges seek-
ing your eligibility status). Before you send it in, carefully examine
the entire SRF to make sure you have completed it correctly, included
your fee payment authorization, and signed it. If you’re younger than
18 years old, your parent or legal guardian also must sign.
Chapter 4: Clearing the Clearinghouse 51

Print additional copies of the completed SRF for your records.
Remember that in building your own portfolio, you want to have
copies of all important paperwork in case something gets lost or is
destroyed.
Create your own personal identification number of four digits
(numbers between 0 and 9) for the SRF to register with the clear-
inghouse. Keep a record of that PIN in the file you’ve organized for
college documents. Pick a number that you can easily remember,
but not a number that might be easily guessed — such as a birth-
day or street address. Use the same common sense you would use
in choosing a debit-card PIN on an online password. Whether
you’re online or sending hard copies, you’ll need to have your own
identification number, so make it something you’ll remember but
that you won’t share with others.
After you’ve submitted your SRF and PIN, check your file status
periodically. You may do this in one of three ways:
 Visit www.ncaaclearinghouse.net and, on the home page,
click Prospective Student-Athletes, click Registered Student
Login, and then enter your SSN and PIN.
 Call the clearinghouse’s 24-hour, toll-free number (877-861-3003)
from a touch-tone phone, and be sure to have your SSN and
PIN available, because you’ll be asked for them.
 Call the clearinghouse customer-service line at 877-262-1492.
(Customer-service representatives are available from 8 a.m. to
5 p.m. Central time, Monday through Friday.)
If you’ve forgotten your PIN, fax or mail your new PIN choice to the
clearinghouse, along with your name, address, SSN, date of birth,
and signature.
The clearinghouse may communicate with you by e-mail or U.S.
mail. E-mail correspondence will require that you’ve submitted a
valid e-mail address in Section I of your SRF. You’ll need to indicate
the communication option you prefer. The clearinghouse prefers
you to select the e-mail option because it’s faster and easier for the
clearinghouse, and it enables you to receive correspondence from
the clearinghouse up to two weeks earlier than you would with
snail mail. You may change your communication option or update
your e-mail address at www.ncaaclearinghouse.net or by writ-
ing or faxing the clearinghouse.
Your SRF will be eligible for processing only with payment of the
$30 application fee (or submission of a fee waiver if you’ve been
granted a waiver). No documents can be processed by the clear-
inghouse until it receives the form and fee. You may pay by debit
Part I: The World of College Sports 
52

or credit card, check, or money order. Do not send cash. If you fax
your form, you must pay by debit or credit card.
Economically disadvantaged students may be eligible for a waiver
of the registration fee — if they have already received a waiver of
the ACT or SAT fee. If this applies to you, the SRF fee-waiver sec-
tion must be completed by an authorized high school official and
include your high school’s seal. If you’re eligible for a fee waiver,
and you registered online, an authorized high school official may
validate the waiver online by following procedures on the clearing-
house Web site. If you haven’t yet been granted a fee waiver by
ACT or SAT, you’re not yet eligible for a waiver of the registration
fee, and your SRF will not be processed (meaning that you cannot
be granted eligibility) until official verification arrives.
Remember that if your SRF has not been processed, any colleges
that request information about you will be told you aren’t yet eligi-
ble. Those colleges will very likely take you off their lists of
prospective student-athletes — definitely not a risk you want to
take. The bottom line: Register between your junior and senior
years of high school, no matter what.
Becoming a Division I Qualifier
Of the three associations (NCAA, NJCAA, and NAIA), the NCAA has
the most stringent academic requirements for athletic eligibility. At
the Division I level, the NCAA categorizes each incoming athlete as
either a qualifier or a nonqualifier based on the student-athlete’s
fulfillment of the NCAA’s minimum academic requirements.
(Division I no longer recognizes partial qualifiers unless a nonquali-
fier is given that status through the NCAA waiver process.)
These qualifying categories are also sometimes referred to as certi-
fication status, and each category dictates the privileges to which
you’re entitled. Your classification as a qualifier, partial qualifier, or
nonqualifier is important because it determines what an athletic
program can provide you.
Qualifier, obviously, is the classification you want, because it pro-
vides you with the best possible opportunity to compete and
receive athletic-scholarship money. In Division I, as a qualifier,
you’re entitled to compete, practice, and receive an athletic schol-
arship in your freshman year. In addition, you’re eligible for four
seasons of competition.
After you’ve registered with the clearinghouse (allowing colleges
to request information about your eligibility), you need to determine
Chapter 4: Clearing the Clearinghouse 53

if you are, indeed, a Division I qualifier, and you need to decide if
you want to play for a Division I school. So how do you go about
becoming a Division I qualifier? In this section, we give you the
answers you need.
Core course requirements
When you’re on the path to becoming a Division I qualifier, you
have to determine what the basic academic requirements for
Division I are. You need to get this information early enough in
your high school career (ninth grade is not too early) so that you
have time to work toward and obtain those requirements. For
example, if at the end of your junior year in high school, you real-
ize that you need to take two more years of English to qualify for a
Division I school, you’re going to be in a bind.
The earlier you know what is expected of you and the more dili-
gent you are about staying on top of your academic requirements,
the better off you’ll be.
The NCAA has what are called core course requirements. A core
course is a regular academic course taken at a high school — not a
vocational, remedial, or prep course. In order for the course to
count, you must have taken the course only during grades 9
through 12.
Check with your school’s guidance department for the listing of core
courses offered by your high school (or go to the Initial-Eligibility
Clearinghouse Web site at www.ncaaclearinghouse.net to
obtain the same list).
Two different courses on the core courses list cannot be counted
as two courses if they have the same content. And high school
courses taken in eighth grade or earlier do not count toward your
required core courses.
If you’ve taken a college course during high school, you may use

the following apply:
 It meets the core course requirement.
 It would be accepted for any other student.
 It is on your high school transcript.
Also, independent-study, Internet, and correspondence courses
may count as core courses as long as:
Part I: The World of College Sports

 The course meets core course requirements.
 You and the instructor have access to each other during the
course so that the instructor can teach, evaluate, and provide
assistance to you.
 Appropriate academic authorities evaluate your work accord-
ing to the high school’s academic policies.
 The course is acceptable and available for any student to take.
 The course is placed on your high school transcript.
Class of 2006 or 2007
If you’re entering a Division I college or university in the fall of 2006
or 2007, your NCAA initial eligibility will be evaluated using the 14
core-course standard. To be classified under this standard, you’ll
need to graduate from high school and have successfully com-
pleted 14 core courses as listed here with a minimum grade point
average of 2.0 out of 4.0.
The 14 core courses are as follows:
 Four years of English
 Two years of mathematics (Algebra I or higher)
 Two years of natural/physical science (one year of lab if
offered by your high school)
 One year of additional English, mathematics, or natural/physi-
cal science
 Two years of social science
 Three years of additional core courses (from any area listed
here or foreign language or nondoctrinal religion or philosophy)
Computer-science courses are not used for initial-eligibility purposes
for students entering a collegiate institution on or after August 1,
2005. However, computer-science courses (such as programming)
that are taught through the mathematics or natural/physical-science
departments receive either math or science credits and are on the
high school’s list of approved core courses, because math or science
may be used after August 1, 2005.
Class of 2008
If you’re entering college in fall of 2008, the new requirement for
Division I will be 16 core courses in the following breakdown:
 Four years of English
 Three years of mathematics (Algebra I or higher)
Chapter 4: Clearing the Clearinghouse 55

 Two years of natural/physical science (one must be a lab 
science)
 One year of additional English, mathematics, or natural/physi-
cal science
 Two years of social science
 Four years of additional core courses (from any area listed
above or foreign language, nondoctrinal religion, or philosophy)
Again, computer-science courses can no longer be used for initial-
eligibility purposes — except for those meeting the requirements
mentioned earlier.
GPA and test-score requirements
As a Division I qualifier, you also — in addition to graduating from
high school and successfully completing the core courses — must
meet the SAT or ACT requirements for your grade point average
(GPA). This is obtained from a sliding scale and decreases from a
1,010 on the SAT and an 86 on the ACT for a 2.0 GPA to a 400 on the
SAT and a 37 on the ACT for a 3.55 GPA. If you have a higher GPA,
you can get away with lower SAT or ACT scores to fulfill your aca-
demic requirements, and vice versa.
You must make sure that the clearinghouse receives your ACT
Assessment and/or SAT I score reports. You can have score reports
sent directly to the clearinghouse by entering a specific code (9999)
printed in the ACT Assessment and SAT I registration packets.
Table 4-1 lists what is required of you as a student to meet the aca-
demic requirements. You can see what is expected for your grade
point average and scores from the ACT and SAT tests. If you don’t
meet the academic requirements listed in this table, you’ll be con-
sidered a nonqualifier for Division I. As a nonqualifier:
 You are not eligible for regular-season competition or prac-
tice during your first year in college.
 You may not receive an athletic scholarship. You may
receive financial aid based only on need in your first year in
college.
 You are permitted only three seasons of competition. To
earn a fourth season, you must graduate before your fifth year
of college.

Division II and III Requirements
Although Division II and Division III are both held to NCAA standards
and requirements, those standards are more lenient for Division II
than they are for Division I — and even more lenient for Division III.
But both of these divisions also offer athletes excellent opportuni-
ties to play for NCAA teams while obtaining top-notch educations.
Like Division I student-athletes, Division II student-athletes must
graduate from high school, have successfully completed 14 core
courses (see “Core course requirements,” earlier in this chapter), and
meet the SAT or ACT requirements for their grade point averages.
But Division II is a little bit more lenient in its academic require-
ments than Division I. The Division II sliding scale requirement for
student athletes is a minimum of 2.0 (out of 4.0) with a sum of 820
on the SAT and 68 on the ACT. You may use the Division I sliding
scale to determine your eligibility as long as you remember the
minimum for Division II (of 2.0 with an 820 SAT/68 ACT). So if you
have a 2.0 GPA and get an 800 on the SAT or a 66 on the ACT, you
do not qualify for Division II.
If you’ve graduated from high school and have either successfully
completed 14 core courses or have met the SAT/ACT requirement
for your grade point average, you’ll be considered a Division II par-
tial qualifier. As a Division II partial qualifier, you may practice with
the team and receive athletic scholarships during their first year,
Chapter 4: Clearing the Clearinghouse 59

but you may not compete your first year. After that, you’re eligible
for four seasons of competition.
If you have either not graduated from high school or have failed to
meet the core-course GPA or the SAT/ACT score requirement, you
will be considered a nonqualifier. As a Division II nonqualifier, you
may not participate in competition or practice during your first
year in college, and you may not receive an athletic scholarship as
a freshman (but you may receive financial aid based on need).
After your freshman year, you — as a Division II nonqualifier — are
eligible for four seasons of competition.
Because NCAA Division III schools do not award athletic scholar-
ships, their athletic-eligibility requirements are different from those
Part I: The World of College Sports

Delaying enrollment for a semester or two
You may decide to delay enrollment in college for a semester or a year, but you need
to know the pros and cons of this choice. Here are two reasons you might make
that move:
 The college that has been recruiting you and that you would like to attend may
have already met its limit for new athletes for the semester and, therefore,
cannot add you to its roster in the fall. The coaches may be telling you that they
really want to bring you onboard in the spring and that they really don’t want to
lose you. So they ask you to delay your enrollment until spring so that they can add
you to their roster at that time. College athletics departments may add athletes
coming into their program in the spring to either the previous year’s scholarship
award limits or to the following year’s limit. So, assuming you had planned to enroll
in August 2006 but put it off until January 2007, the school where you’re headed
could add you to its 2006–2007 roster or to its 2007–2008 roster, if necessary.
The risk with this arrangement is that what you have is a verbal agreement —
nothing is in writing. Before January 2007 rolls around, those same coaches
may find another athlete they want more than you. If so, you’re out of luck.
 You may not have qualified academically and, therefore, decide to delay enroll-
ment in order to try to bring up your grades at a community college, for exam-
ple. This is a good idea, especially if you go to a school where you can continue
to play (NCAA Division III or NJCAA, for example) while improving your aca-
demic record.
The problem with this plan is that the longer you delay enrolling in a Division I
school, the more likely it is that the coaches at the university you initially planned
to attend will lose interest in you — especially if you aren’t able to play at the
school you’re temporarily attending.

of Divisions I or II. Instead, Division III requirements are determined
by institutional, conference, and other NCAA regulations.
There are no partial qualifiers or nonqualifiers in Division III. Division
III student-athletes must be full-time students who meet the require-
ments of their respective schools and the conferences within which
those schools play. This means you have to check with the school
you plan to attend to know exactly what its academic requirements
are. If you meet the academic requirements, you’re eligible to play.
NAIA and NJCAA Requirements
Like NCAA Divisions II and III, NAIA and NJCAA colleges offer the
student-athlete excellent opportunities to play sports at the col-
lege level and get a quality education. You may be playing without
benefit of an athletic scholarship, but if you excel at the junior col-
lege level, you may be able to transfer to an NCAA Division I or II
school with an athletic scholarship. (See Chapter 18 for more infor-
mation about transferring.)
In order to be eligible to represent any member institution of the
NAIA in any manner (scrimmages, intercollegiate competitions), an
entering freshman must meet two of three entry-level require-
ments. An entering freshman is defined by the NAIA as “a student
who upon becoming identified with an institution has not been pre-
viously identified with an institution of higher learning for two
semesters or three quarters (or equivalent).” In other words, an
incoming freshman is considered to be a student who has had no
more than two semester or three quarters with another college.
The three entry-level requirements for the NAIA are as follows:
 Achieve a minimum overall high school grade point average
of 2.0 on a 4.0 scale.
 Graduate in the top half of your high school graduating class.
 Achieve a minimum of 860 on the SAT or 18 on the ACT. You
must take the SAT/ACT test on a national testing day. Be sure
that the testing place has been approved as a national testing
site. Some schools may offer a testing site for a practice test.
Make sure you don’t confuse the two.
The NJCAA’s requirements for entering freshman student-athletes
are as follows:
 You must have graduated from high school, received a high
school equivalency diploma, or been certified as having
Chapter 4: Clearing the Clearinghouse 61

passed a national test such as the General Education
Development (GED) test. The high school from which you’ve
graduated must be accredited or recognized by the
Department of Education within that state.
 If you haven’t graduated from high school, you can estab-
lish eligibility for athletic participation by completing one
term of college work, passing 12 credits with a 1.75 GPA or
higher. This term must be taken after your high school class
has graduated.
 If you haven’t graduated from high school, but you’ve
already earned sufficient credit for high school graduation
status, you can establish eligibility for athletic participation
by completing one term of college work, passing 12 credits
with a 1.75 GPA or higher. You can complete this term before
your high school class has graduated.
 If you haven’t graduated from high school, and you’ve estab-
lished eligibility as a student-athlete by one of the two pre-
ceding methods (successfully completing one term of college
work before or after your high school class has graduated),
you may be added to the eligibility roster after completion
of the requirements and after the college term is over.
If you’re completing high school, and you’re enrolled at the same
time in 12 or more credits at a junior college, you’re eligible for ath-
letic participation with the completion of the NJCAA High School
Waiver Form (Form 3-e). This form must be signed by your high
school principal and the college president. Note: This provision
applies only if your high school class has not graduated at the time
you enroll in college.
To find Form 3-e, go the NJCAA Web site at www.njcaa.org and
click Forms. Click Administration. Here, you’ll be able to download
Form 3-e.
Reviewing Unusual Student
Situations — and Making 
Sure You’re Still Eligible
If you have a more unusual situations than the norm — maybe
you’re an international student, you were home-schooled, or you
have a learning disability — there also are eligibility requirements
for you. And, like all other prospective student-athletes, you need
to be aware of what the most recent eligibility requirements are.
Part I: The World of College Sports 
62

The most important thing to remember is that, regardless of your
special circumstances, you still must fulfill the same minimum
requirements that all other incoming freshmen have to meet.
International student-athletes
International student-athletes are expected to meet the same initial-
eligibility standards as domestic students; however, there are dif-
ferent rules for nearly every country. For example, several countries
require students to have a Leaving Certificate, which indicates they
have completed certain core courses. The NCAA Initial-Eligibility
Clearinghouse uses these Leaving Certificates to determine the 
eligibility status of international student-athletes.
So if you’re an international student, you need to know the clearing-
house requirements for your specific country — in addition to need-
ing to know all other requirements of the clearinghouse, requirements
of the particular division or association in which you plan to com-
pete, and the requirements of the specific college or university you
plan to attend. That’s a lot to keep track of — but you can do it with a
little planning and organization (and with the help of this book!).
NCAA Initial-Eligibility Clearinghouse requirements
International students who want to enroll as incoming freshmen
and compete in NCAA Division I or Division II athletics must — 
like all other incoming freshmen student-athletes, domestic or
international — register with the clearinghouse.
There are several documents required to apply to the clearing-
house, and foreign students must submit all the following items:
 NCAA Initial-Eligibility Clearinghouse Online Application for
Foreign Student-Athletes: Go to the NCAA clearinghouse Web
site at www.ncaaclearinghouse.net and then click Registra-
tion Form for Foreign Students (Foreign Student Release Form).
 A $30 payment by MasterCard/Visa: The fee is not refundable
if you decide not to attend an NCAA institution.
 Original academic records (or certified [attested] copies of
the original documents), and certified, literal-English trans-
lations of records not originally in English: These must be
mailed (not faxed) to the clearinghouse. That address is NCAA
Initial-Eligibility Clearinghouse, 2255 North Dubuque Rd., P.O.
Box 4044, Iowa City, IA 52243-4044 USA. The telephone number
is 1-319-337-1492. (The clearinghouse office hours are Monday
through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. U.S. Central time.) Send any
mail to the NCAA clearinghouse by regular surface or air mail.
Chapter 4: Clearing the Clearinghouse 63

International students must submit official records from all sec-
ondary or middle schools attended, as well as records from any
universities, colleges, or professional schools attended. This
includes any secondary or middle-school coursework completed
in the United States. Academic records should show individual
subjects studied and the grades you received. If your secondary
or postsecondary records don’t clearly indicate the subject stud-
ied or their content, you have to submit syllabi of the courses or
descriptions of the curriculum along with the records.
 Score(s) from either the ACT or SAT standardized test: See
the “Minimum academic standards” section, later in this chap-
ter, for more information on these tests as they apply to inter-
national students.
If your original academic record is difficult to replace, the registrar —
or other recordkeeping school official — from the original issuing
institution should make a photocopy of your record and certify
that it is the true copy of the original. He can do this by placing the
institution’s official seal or stamp and his signature on the docu-
ment after photocopying it. (Do not send difficult-to-replace origi-
nal documents — the clearinghouse will not return them.) Records
certified by lecturers, professors, tutors, or any other school offi-
cials who do not hold primary responsibility for maintaining the
academic records will not be accepted.
If the academic record is not in English, a translation must be sent
in addition to, not in place of, the original record. The translation
should be a literal translation, not an interpretive one. Any tran-
scripts, certificates, translations, or examination results that appear
to have been altered or are irregular will be forwarded to the appro-
priate school authorities or examination board for verification.
If an NCAA Division I or Division II school requests your eligibility
status, the clearinghouse will review your final transcript and
proof of graduation to make a final certification decision according
to the NCAA standards (and give that information to the school
that has requested it).
Note: If you don’t submit all the documents required or the $30 fee,
or if no member institution requests your eligibility status, your
incomplete file will be discarded after three years, requiring you to
pay a new fee if certification is requested after that time.
You can find additional information about some of the required
items in the box labeled Important Information on the Student
Release Form (Foreign).

Minimum academic standards
If you’ve never previously enrolled as a full-time student in a uni-
versity, you must meet minimum academic standards in order to
be eligible for practice, competition, and athletic financial aid your
first year. The minimum required standards will vary depending on
your country. The standards are outlined in the NCAA’s Guide to
International Academic Standards for Athletics Eligibility (which you
can find at www.ncaa.org).
You’ll need a minimum score on the SAT or the ACT in order to be
eligible to play in the NCAA. International students must take the
SAT or the ACT. Other tests, such as the TOEFL or TWSE, are not
acceptable. If you haven’t taken the ACT or SAT examination, con-
tact your secondary school for information about taking one of
these standardized tests. Enter the code 9999 on the registration
form or answer document to have your scores sent directly to the
NCAA clearinghouse.
If your secondary school does not have information about these
examinations, you can contact the ACT or SAT directly:

sidered a transfer student upon enrolling at an NCAA university.
See Chapter 18 for more information on your eligibility as a trans-
fer student.
Playing for NCAA Division III, NAIA, or NJCAA
All the terms for eligibility we cover in the preceding sections for
international students are the eligibility requirements for NCAA
Division I and Division II institutions. But if you plan to attend and
compete for an NCAA Division III school or an NAIA or NJCAA
school, you’ll need to check with that particular institution to
know what is required of you.
Chapter 4: Clearing the Clearinghouse 65

To see which schools are NCAA Division III institutions, go to
www.ncaa.org/conference. To find out which schools are
either NAIA or NJCAA member institutions, respectively, go to
www.naia.org or www.njcaa.org.
Home-schooled athletes
If you’ve attended a home school or a nontraditional school for all
or part of your high school career, and you plan to enroll in an
NCAA Division I or Division II institution, you must register with
the clearinghouse. In order for the clearinghouse to be able to eval-
uate your certification status for purposes of NCAA athletic initial
eligibility, you have to submit specific documents to the clearing-
house. We let you know which ones in the following section.
If you plan to attend a school that is NCAA Division III or a member
of the NAIA or NJCAA, see “Playing for NCAA Division III, NAIA, or
NJCC,” earlier in this chapter (the section is written for interna-
tional students, but it applies to home-schooled athletes as well).
Register with the clearinghouse at www.ncaaclearinghouse.net.
Click Prospective Student-Athletes, click Domestic Student Release
Form, and follow the prompts.
Register with the clearinghouse after completion of your junior
year of high school. The preliminary certification (see “Discovering
the NCAA Initial-Eligibility Clearinghouse,” earlier in this chapter,
for more on this) is important because it lets you know if you’re on
track for graduation and in full compliance with academic require-
ments. The final certification from the clearinghouse will deter-
mine whether you’ll be eligible for practice, competition, and
institutional financial aid at an NCAA Division I or Division II insti-
tution during your freshman year.
After registering, you have to send the following information to the
clearinghouse:
 Standardized test score(s): These must be sent directly from
the testing agency.
The clearinghouse won’t accept test scores received on home-
school transcripts. Also, a Student Score Report or scores
taken directly from a Student Score Report cannot be accepted
by the clearinghouse for initial-eligibility purposes. Generally,
three reports are sent out: One goes to the high school or
home-school headquarters, one goes to the counselors, and
one goes directly to the student’s home. The clearinghouse will
not accept any documentation that was in the student’s posses-
sion. So, what does this mean for the home-schooled student/
Part I: The World of College Sports 
66

athlete? Your score report must be sent to the clearinghouse
directly from a counselor or established institute of education.
 Home-school transcript: The transcript must include course
titles, course grades, units of credit for courses, the grading
scale (if other than A–F letter grades), and the signature of 
the home-school administrator (the parent or other person
who organized, taught, and evaluated your home-school
coursework).
 Transcripts from any other high school, college, or nontradi-
tional program you’ve attended: These transcripts must be
mailed directly from the issuing institution.
 Proof of high school graduation, including your specific
graduation date.
 Evidence that home schooling was conducted in accordance
with state laws: This means a written statement from the
home-school administrator verifying compliance with state
home-school legislation. Attach any supporting documenta-
tion you may have received in working with public schools,
churches, or national organizations in which you were hon-
ored school credits for your work.
 List of texts used throughout home schooling: Be sure to list
the text titles, the publishers of those texts, and in which
courses the texts were used.
If your home-school coursework was taken through an established
nontraditional program (for example, a correspondence course, an
Internet course, or a tutoring service) that evaluated your course-
work and issued transcripts, have that program provide a copy of
your transcript and provide contact information so that the clear-
inghouse can obtain further information, if necessary.
The clearinghouse will evaluate home-school coursework only after
all required documents have been received. After this information
is received, the clearinghouse may need to request additional infor-
mation or clarification before completing your certification. Send 
all questions regarding this matter to the NCAA Clearinghouse,
Attention: Home School Evaluation, NCAA Clearinghouse, 301 ACT
Dr., Box 4043, Iowa City, IA 52243-4043.
The learning-disabled 
student athlete
Although the NCAA academic requirements for Division I and
Division II athletics are the same for all students, including students
with learning disabilities, as a student with a diagnosed disability,
Chapter 4: Clearing the Clearinghouse 67

you are entitled to some accommodations to enable you to meet
these requirements.
One exception the NCAA makes for learning-disabled students is that
a student with a disability who is a Division I nonqualifier out of high
school may earn a fourth season of competition upon qualifying
(whereas nondisabled students may earn only three seasons of com-
petition, except if they graduate before their fifth year of college).
Many collegiate institutions provide academic accommodations for
students with disabilities. However, you need to approach the col-
lege to determine if such accommodations are available. Do not
rely on the athletic department of the college to provide this infor-
mation. And don’t send documentation of your disability to the
clearinghouse (see the following section).
Documenting your learning disability
The only time disability documentation needs to be sent to the
NCAA is when you, as a prospective student-athlete with a disabil-
ity, would like to use core courses taken after high school gradua-
tion and you plan to attend a Division I college.
Be sure to send this information about your disability to NCAA
Disability Services, not to the clearinghouse. If you submit them to
the NCAA clearinghouse, other NCAA schools will be able to
access your disability records — and those are records you may
want to keep private.
To document your disability, send the following information to
NCAA Disability Services, P.O. Box 6222, Indianapolis, IN 46206-6222:

Overcoming recruiters’ worries
You may find that some coaches who are recruiting you are afraid that, because
you’re home-schooled, you won’t be approved as a qualifier by the clearinghouse.
To assure these doubters that you’re taking all the right courses, you’ll want to work
with your parents or home-school instructor to ensure that you are, indeed, taking
the required number of core courses in the appropriate subject matters.
You may want to consider providing coaches copies of your home-school transcript
and ACT/SAT test score. Stay in touch with the coaches for whom you hope to play,
and make sure you provide them with all the academic material possible to put their
minds at ease.

results: These reports and results must have been completed
with the last three years.
 A copy of your most recent Individual Education Plan (IEP);
Section 504 Plan; or, for private high schools, a statement
on the high school’s letterhead describing the accommoda-
tions, if any, you received because of your disability.
Core courses
If you’re a high school student with a disability, and you’ve
received help (for example, taken special classes or received extra
time) because of that disability, you’re eligible for the following:
 You can use courses for students with disabilities that are desig-
nated on the high school’s list of NCAA-Approved Core Courses.
 You can use approved core courses taken before you enroll in
college, including courses taken in the summer after your
eighth semester of high school or after your high school grad-
uation. Remember: For Division I, you must document your
disability with the NCAA Disability Services to receive this
accommodation.
Nonstandard tests
If you have a disability, you also may take a nonstandard test to
satisfy SAT and/or ACT test-score requirements (or, more specifi-
cally, use SAT and/or ACT scores achieved during nonstandard
administrations). Follow these guidelines:
 Register for nonstandard testing as described by the ACT or
SAT, submitting a properly documented and confirmed diag-
nosis. This means that, after you’ve been tested by a physi-
cian and documented as learning disabled, testing exceptions
may be made for you for the ACT or SAT. For example, the test
may be read to you, or you may be offered an extended time
frame to take the tests. But you must have proper documenta-
tion to support your special needs.
 Follow procedures governed by the ACT or SAT. The test
may not be administered by a member of your high school
athletic department or any NCAA school’s athletic department.
 If you take a nonstandard ACT or SAT, you may take the test
on a date other than a national testing date, but you still must
achieve the required test score for your GPA. (Visit the ACT
and SAT Web sites — www.act.org and www.collegeboard.
com — to find out what their national testing dates are.)
 Your high school counselor may help you register to take
the nonstandard test.

If you aren’t certified
What if you’ve done everything as instructed, and you receive a final Initial-Eligibility
Certification Report from the clearinghouse indicating that you are not certified?
In this case, you should contact the college/university where you’ve been admitted
and ask the school to file an initial-eligibility waiver with the NCAA on your behalf. In
considering a waiver of the initial-eligibility standards, the following may be factors:
 The extent to which your failure to meet the initial-eligibility standards is attrib-
utable to a disability
 Whether noncore courses you’ve taken were specified in your IEP, satisfied
graduation requirements, and/or prepared you to successfully complete a
planned course of study at a particular collegiate institution
 Your overall academic record, including performance on standardized tests
 Assessments of high school personnel attesting to the likelihood of your aca-
demic success in college while participating in athletics
 Accommodations for students with disabilities available to and used by you
during high school
 Other factors useful in assessing your preparedness to succeed in college.
Remember: You cannot count on anything — a disability, a superb athletic résumé
and reputation, friends in high places — other than yourself to get you into the col-
lege of your choice. Just meeting the NCAA academic rules does not guarantee
your admission into a college; you must still apply for admission. The important thing
to remember is that no matter how terrific an athlete you are, no matter how supe-
rior a student you are, no college or university will accept you if you don’t apply. In
short, you still must follow all the rules that every other would-be college student
(athlete or not) must follow.
Remember: To be safe, don’t pick one or two schools and assume you’ll get in. Have
backup schools. In life, you should always have a backup plan. And as the football-
loving, late president Theodore Roosevelt said, “In life, as in a football game, the
principle to follow is ‘Hit the line hard.’” In other words, give everything you do —
especially anything having to do with your academics and athletics — a 110 percent
effort all the time.

Part II
Getting Recruited

In this part . . .
You’ll discover what colleges are looking for when they
begin their own recruiting process. Each school wants
and needs student-athletes who will complement its pro-
gram. You’ll ﬁnd out how to become the athlete recruiters
talk about, how to handle the press, and how to talk to
coaches.
Great ideas are just that until you put them into motion. In
this part, you’ll formulate a plan to promote yourself, talk
to recruiters, and get your foot in the door. Because not
every student-athlete has a recruiter knocking on his door,
we help you ﬁgure out how to promote yourself and do a
little door-knocking of your own.

F
ootball still rules as the king of college athletics, with 43 per-
cent of all Division I men’s athletic scholarships in the NCAA
(for 14 sports) going to football players. (Thirty-four percent of all
men’s athletic scholarships for 31 sports in Divisions I and II of the
NCAA go to football players.) But even though football and basket-
ball are the highest-profile sports, attracting far more television
and media coverage than any other college sports, prospective
football and basketball student-athletes are no longer the only ones
to be actively recruited and get full rides. Today, schools recruit the
best soccer players and volleyball players, the best hockey and
lacrosse players, the best tennis and softball players — and that
diversity of sports opportunities means greatly heightened compe-
tition for already-limited scholarship funds.
So what does this mean for you? If you’re one of the top recruits in
your sport, you may not have to worry about getting accepted to
college. But if you’re among the vast majority of prospective stu-
dent-athletes who are not offered full rides, you’ll probably have to
work a bit harder to gain the attention of the college coaches. And
either way, you still have to meet the academic requirements for
the division and the school you plan to attend before you can be
accepted and compete.
In this chapter, we give you helpful advice about how to get
recruited, as well as how to maintain your eligibility status after
you’ve been accepted to college, whether you’re one of the elite or
one of the slightly-less-than-elite.

Blue-Chippers Come in 
All Types and Sizes
The chance to compete in intercollegiate athletics and to receive
scholarship money to do it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a
relatively few lucky and talented student-athletes. Playing at the
NCAA Division I level with scholarship money is an even rarer
opportunity. In fact, less than 1 percent of all high school athletes
receive any form of scholarship at the NCAA Division I level.
Blue-chip athletes are those lucky, talented, and rare student-athletes
who not only get recruited to play NCAA Division I sports, but also
receive full-ride scholarship. Although they’re lucky and talented
enough to play Division I sports, they still face tough odds when it
comes to playing their respective sports professionally. For exam-
ple, of the nearly 1 million high school football players, only about
250 make it to the NFL (6,000-to-1 odds, in case you’re counting).
And of about 550,000 high school basketball players, only about 50
make it to the NBA (10,000-to-1 odds).
But we’re still only talking about football and basketball players.
Though many people think of the typical blue-chip athlete as that
300-pound lineman or 6'11" basketball center, the reality is that
blue-chip athletes now come in many types and sizes — from the
thick, muscular football player to the long, lean swimmer to the
compact, graceful gymnast. This is because as athletic programs
have grown, so has the variety of sports (and athletes) sought out
by Division I athletics departments: soccer, volleyball, tennis, golf,
softball, fencing. . . . Combine this diversifying change with the soar-
ing costs of colleges/universities, shake or stir, and you have the
recipe for intense competition for very limited scholarship funds.
And this intense competition makes for stricter eligibility require-
ments for NCAA Division I and II athletics; it makes not only being
noticed by college coaches but also, more important, being invited
to join these teams even more difficult. But don’t despair. You can
do certain things to improve your chances, the most important of
which is to focus on your grades and keep them up.
In order to be a college athlete, you must first be a college student.
You must obtain and maintain the academic requirements for the
college of your choice, or else the coaches will never look at you.

Chapter 5: Knowing What Colleges Are Looking For 75
Being the parent of a blue-chipper
As the parent of blue-chipper, what can you do to help your talented student-
athlete get into an NCAA Division I school? Take a look at the following list:
 Make sure that this dream of playing in the NCAA’s Division I is your son’s or
daughter’s dream and not yours. This is the most important item in this list — you
can’t relive your glory days through your child, and you certainly shouldn’t try.
Don’t push your kid so hard to make a Division I team that you make his life mis-
erable trying to fulfill everyone else’s fantasies. Your pushing and meddling could
adversely affect not only your child’s mental health, but also his entire life.
 Be honest about your child’s true abilities. You may have to get an outside,
objective source — such as a professional scout or college coach — to eval-
uate your child’s talent to make sure that she is, indeed, a blue-chipper.
Overstating your child’s abilities (see “The ones who recruit themselves,” later
in this chapter) can bring very negative consequences.
 Assuming that your child really is a blue-chipper, do your homework. Know
what is needed for top athletes to be recruited and be well educated in the
process. And don’t take this job lightly, expecting someone else — like a high
school coach or guidance counselor — to do it for you. High school coaches are
paid to be full-time teachers or administrators and receive a small stipend for
their added coaching responsibilities. You’re the parent. Who will care more
about and be able to take more time for this process than you?
 Investigate every camp, recruiter, school, coach, and program. You don’t want
to waste thousands of dollars sending your child to a showcase, for example,
if the recruiters and coaches won’t be there. More important, finding the school
that fits your child’s academic and athletic needs is up to you. (Be sure to read
Chapters 4, 6, 7, 9, and 13.) Don’t just act knowledgeable about the recruiting
process; become knowledgeable about it — very knowledgeable.
A showcase is a kind of tournament that does not have a winner and is more
common in team sports like soccer, volleyball, and softball. The sole purpose of
these showcases is for college coaches to evaluate prospects in a competition set-
ting. While the teams try to win, each team usually plays the same number of games
regardless of wins or losses. Sometimes showcases also include drills where ath-
letes can display their talents individually to the coaches who are in attendance.
 Focus on academics. In choosing a college, education should be the first con-
sideration, not the reverse. And don’t lose track of the importance of a college
education and a college degree. Your child will be an athlete for only a compar-
atively short time, and anything can happen: injury, a change in plans, or a change
in goals. But before that, your child has three basic responsibilities before he can
receive a scholarship: (1) to pass designated core courses with a certain grade
point average, (2) to achieve a certain score on a standardized test, and (3) to
report both results to the NCAA clearinghouse. Stay on top of all three of these,
and make sure they happen; otherwise, that Division I dream will not happen.

Analyzing the Three 
Kinds of Students
A very small percentage of student-athletes are actively recruited
by colleges, some as early as the eighth grade. The vast majority of
student-athletes need to recruit themselves. But both groups of
athletes need to consider carefully the school they ultimately
choose: the academic climate, the athletic climate, the social cli-
mate. The college you attend must be a good fit, or you won’t bene-
fit from your education as you should. And both groups need to be
careful not to expect all the work of recruiting or being recruited to
be done for them. Many a student-athlete finds himself out of luck
and out of school because he took for granted that the work (get-
ting the grades or test scores, or registering with the clearinghouse
and responding to recruiting letters) would be done by someone
else. Don’t make those mistakes.
The ones who get recruited
The recruitment process is generally much less stressful for blue-
chip athletes. They don’t have to go out looking for college pro-
grams; the programs come looking for them. They don’t have any
of the stresses of finding appropriate schools and sending out
mass mailings of letters introducing themselves, sending highlight
films — it’s all taken care of for them.
The problem is that these star athletes sometimes take the process
for granted, getting used to having everything done for them. They
may choose a school based solely on athletics (TV exposure, the
promise of being able to go pro after college or before college is
over) and lose sight of the main reason for choosing a school: aca-
demics. Often, these students don’t have control of the recruiting
process; the recruiting process has control of them. They simply
listen to coaches, family, and/or friends who tell them how good
they are in their sport, and they forget to ask questions about
things other than athletics.
If you’re one of the lucky few being actively recruited by college
athletic programs, follow these tips to ensure that you get the most
out of your experience:
 Because you obviously won’t be the only player on the 
team on scholarship, ask the coaches which players will be
returning and whether you’ll have a chance to compete for
a starting position.
Part II: Getting Recruited 
76

 Research the number of former players who have gone 
on to professional playing careers from the schools you’re
considering.
 Make sure you choose the right program for you and not
simply the top-ranked or most recognized team. For exam-
ple, ask yourself whether the way the team plays is suited to
your style of play.
 Take your sport out of the equation, and ask yourself if you
would be happy at the school.
The ones who recruit themselves
Students who fall into this category generally have a much more
challenging time picking a school, but more often than not, they
have a more rewarding experience in school. This is because they
appreciate the opportunity more — especially if they’re rewarded
with an athletic scholarship. (Remember how few athletic scholar-
ships are actually awarded; in fact; more money is available through
nonathletic and academic scholarships than athletic scholarships.)
When a student recruits a school on her own, that student gener-
ally researches more than the athletics program and truly focuses
on what it will be like to be a student-athlete. These student-athletes
usually are in control of the recruiting process and do not allow
themselves to be influenced by the process itself.
If this sounds like a good description of your situation, here are
some thoughts to consider:
 Do as much research as you can. Take advantage of the
Internet.
 Consider schools that match your skills, preferences, and
goals. Everyone wants to play at the highest level possible,
but be realistic about your skill level, and focus on colleges
that have the same goals and values you have.
 Initiate contact with the coach. Send a brief letter introducing
yourself and letting the coach know the type of student and
player you are.
 Just as we advise the blue-chip athlete, take your sport out
of the equation, and ask yourself if you would be happy at
the school.
Chapter 5: Knowing What Colleges Are Looking For 77

The ones who don’t fit 
either category
Students who don’t fit into either category are usually the ones
who don’t get recruited but think they should be, so they don’t
recruit themselves. They sometimes become very bitter toward
student-athletes who do get recruited, and they generally believe
they’re better than they truly are. They’ve probably been told by
well-meaning parents and/or coaches that they’re the best and that
they’re as good as or better than those students being courted by
Division I schools. They begin to believe this myopic hype and
think they shouldn’t have to pursue any schools — that the
schools should be pursuing them.
We know too many stories of students who don’t get recruited by
Division I schools and who don’t recruit themselves to these
schools because they don’t think they need or ought to. In the
meantime, a Division II or III school shows some interest, but the
student feels he deserves a higher level of athletic competition (for-
getting entirely about the quality of education), so he ignores these
offers or signs of interest. By the time scholarships should be being
offered and signed, the Division II or III schools have moved on
because of lack of interest or response from the student — and still,
no Division I schools are showing interest. Guess where that leaves
the overconfident, foolish student? High and dry.
If you’re thinking, “Oh, this doesn’t apply to me,” here’s a tip to keep
in mind around scholarship/recruiting time: In Division I football, 98
percent of all scholarship offers are complete by Christmas, even
though the signing date for scholarship offers is in early February.
Yet, every year, hundreds of high school seniors are still waiting for
scholarship offers in January and into February. Although this exam-
ple is specific to football, the situation occurs in almost every col-
lege sport. Don’t let your chance to get a scholarship at a lower-level
Division I or II school get away by sitting around waiting for the “big
boys” to come knocking on your door.
Keeping Score: Academics 
Do Count
During your first couple of years in high school, going to college
seems so far away that it’s easy not to worry about your grades. In
addition, high school is a big step and can be a big adjustment for
you, so you may slip a bit academically. Or you may think that
Part II: Getting Recruited 
78

you’re a good-enough athlete that you’ll get a scholarship and be
admitted to a college regardless of your grades.
You can be the best player on your team and win all sorts of honors
and awards, but if you won’t be eligible to play, your chances of
earning a scholarship usually lie somewhere between slim and
none. There is a reason college athletes are called student-athletes.
By the time you begin your junior year, ideally you’ve started seri-
ously thinking about college — especially if you want to play a
sport in college. Many people believe the junior year is the year
that makes or breaks a lot of prospects, and this section can help
you make it a breakout year for you.
If you’re a senior, and you’re confident that you’ll be offered a
scholarship or if you’ve already been offered one, your senior year
of high school still counts. The clearinghouse and colleges (includ-
ing the one that may have already offered you a scholarship) look
at what you’re enrolled in your senior year and also get your final
transcript after graduation to determine how well you did in all
those classes. So forget about blowing off your senior year —
unless you’re willing to risk blowing off your athletic scholarship.
More and more frequently, recruited prospects are making verbal
commitments during their junior year. If this is the case for you,
staying on track both academically and athletically is even more
important. If you’re still undecided or not getting noticed as much
as you’d like during your junior year, this year is equally important
for you as well. If you’re just about to start your junior year (or
you’re even younger and you’re planning ahead), you need a time-
line for that year.
You can’t start paying attention to your grades or attending
summer camps for your sport too early. And you should take the
PSAT for the first time (without studying for it) during your sopho-
more year, to get an idea of where you stand and to get practice
taking the test.
As a junior, you need to do several things:
 Keep up your schoolwork. We can’t stress the importance of
this enough.
 Take the PSAT again in October. Study for the test this time.
 Register with the clearinghouse. See Chapter 4 for help 
with this.
 Register for the ACT and SAT. Most students take these tests
at least twice in an attempt to get the highest score possible.
Chapter 5: Knowing What Colleges Are Looking For 79

(You’ll need to decide whether the fall, spring, or summer test
dates are best for you, depending on the sport you play and
possible conflicts with your sports schedule.)
 Make informal visits to college campuses throughout the
year. See Chapter 10 for more on college visits.
 Send out your first contact letters at the beginning of the
year. Include copies of your fall and spring schedules, when
available. Ask your high school coach to write letters of rec-
ommendation to a few preferred colleges. (Written contact by
college coaches is allowed beginning in September of your
junior year in all Division I sports other than men’s basketball;
in men’s basketball, written contact by college coaches is
allowed at the conclusion of the sophomore year.)
 Travel with your team to recruiting events throughout the
year. Write college coaches, and make arrangements for them
to evaluate your play. Remember: Now is the time to show-
case yourself!
 Prepare a highlight videotape of yourself to be sent out
when requested. Do not send out unsolicited tapes.
 If a college coach sends you a player profile form/question-
naire to complete, return it immediately, even if you can’t
answer all the questions. Send updates as you get the addi-
tional information.
 Continue playing your sport as much as possible and trying
to get as much exposure as possible. If you’re playing club
sports, you need to be selfish and play for a team with a lot of
exposure.
 Prepare for phone calls from coaches. During March of your
junior year, one phone call from college coaches is permitted
in all sports other than football and basketball. All subsequent
calls may be made after July 1 (after your junior year) and are
limited to once per week.
If you’re a football prospect, a coach may call you once during
May of your junior year but may not call you again until
September 1 at the beginning of your senior year. At that time,
coaches are permitted to call you once a week except during a
contact period when they can call you as often as they like.
If men’s basketball is in your future, you may expect one call a
month from coaches starting June 15 after your sophomore
year. From August 1 after your junior year until the beginning
of your senior year, coaches can call you twice, but when your
senior year starts, that goes to once a week.
Women’s basketball is slightly different. Coaches get to call
you once a month during April and May of your junior year
Part II: Getting Recruited 
80

and then once more from June 1 through June 20 of that year.
From June 21 through June 30, one call is permitted; then
three total calls can be made in July. When August 1 hits, the
calls are limited to once a week!
In all Division II sports, coaches may begin calling you once a
week on June 15 after your junior year. Division II football
coaches have the same leeway as Division I coaches during a
contact period when they can call as often as they like.
There are no restrictions or limitations when it comes to
Division III coaches calling you, so don’t be surprised if they
call you as early as your freshman or sophomore year.
A contact period is exactly what it sounds like: It’s the time
when college coaches are allowed to meet with you and/or
your parents, in person and off campus.
 Remember to maintain your academic performance (keep
those grades up!), and keep up your level of athletic per-
formance. You may be attracting the attention of colleges now.
 The summer between your junior and senior years, focus on
attending “select,” “advanced,” “elite,” or “showcase”
camps. In this environment, you’ll be able to gauge your play
against the best players at the camps. The college coaches
will be able to do the same. (The summer between your junior
and senior years is very important.)
Analyzing the Athlete 
off the Field: Looking 
at the Whole Athlete
If you aren’t a blue-chip athlete, you still have the chance to partic-
ipate in an intercollegiate sport. You can market your best qualities
in ways that will gain the attention of a coach at any level.
Beyond raw or polished athletic talent, beyond media coverage
and cocky attitudes, colleges and universities are now preferring to
recruit the complete student-athlete — in other words, the whole
package. Schools are looking for a diverse student body, so your
gender, ethnic origin, geographic origin, personal character, and
academic performance are among the criteria that colleges and
universities consider. Although more and more schools at all levels
are doing this, Division III schools (nonscholarship schools) have
been using these criteria for years.
Chapter 5: Knowing What Colleges Are Looking For 81

Your athletic ability is not all that the schools will look at. Your
grades matter; your extracurricular activities matter. If you’re
active in your church, synagogue, or mosque; if you’re politically
or environmentally active; if you hand out food to the homeless at
Thanksgiving — all of these activities matter to colleges and uni-
versities. They all say something about you, and what they say
may be just what a particular college wants to hear.
So, besides playing your heart out and keeping your grades up,
stay busy being an important individual in this very large, busy
world. In other words, make a difference.

I
f you’re reading this book, you must be committed to your 
sport — you understand the commitment involved to get to the
next level. Most likely, you’ve passed the preteen (adolescent)
stage where the majority of your peers began to walk away from
sports. For whatever reason — hormones, fashion, peer pressure,
or insecurities — the desire to be an athlete becomes less and less
appealing for some, but it only grows in you. You’re willing to give
the time, energy, blood, sweat, and tears needed to make it in your
sport. For you, understanding the evolution of the college/elite ath-
lete is very important. These athletes aren’t born; they’re trained —
and that training begins at the recreational and club-ball level.
In this chapter, we show you how to begin. Most people are under
the impression that the game of recruiting begins when you pick up
your first ball or run your first race. Not so. The game of recruiting —
or getting noticed — has its own rules and begins only when you
start. Knowing how to use your current coaches, family, local media,
and teammates is just the beginning. As you build your own portfo-
lio, you’ll better understand how to promote yourself while doing
something you love.
What’s that old sports saying: “There is no I in team”? But as you
enter the recruiting game, you’ll (temporarily) find that there is an
I. And you have to know how to promote yourself effectively.

Discovering the New Kid 
on the Block
The first of many questions you must ask yourself as you step into
this arena is “Why am I playing a sport?” You’ll find soon enough
that playing on the field or court has been the easy part. As you
step into the far more competitive world of select or club ball, col-
lege recruiting, and playing in the big leagues, you have to be sure
of what you really want.
In the movie Grease, Danny (John Travolta) turns his back on his
leather-wearing, drag-racing ways to earn a letter in sports — all
because he wants to impress Sandy (Olivia Newton-John). The
theme is common in Hollywood and real life. Sports are cool! And
kids who play sports are cool, right?
The social status attached to being an athlete cannot be denied,
and parents are all too aware of this. For this reason, parents,
guardians, friends, and even coaches often push kids to the limit in
the name of scoring the winning goal or making the final shot. They
push and push until, quite suddenly, a star is born. After all the
hours on the field or court, all the time running drills and working
the hand-eye coordination, something clicks.
For all the pushing that parents and coaches do, however, it is you,
the athlete, who makes the final call. You have to feel the desire in
your gut. You have to be able to say, “I really want this” — and
mean it.
Statistically, the majority of athletes drop out of competitive sports
by their early teens. The time commitment, money, energy, and/or
agility is more than they can handle. Others understand that this is
just the beginning. You may be one of these others.
What happens after your decide to take sports to the next level has
as much to do with athletic ability as it does with the kind of sup-
port you receive from your coaches and parents.
Playing club ball
Check the by-laws of any ball club, traveling club, or select club, and
you’ll find the same mission statement: to promote the advanced
players. In the late 1970s, the idea of creating teams — select teams
with more advanced players — gained popularity as parents and
coaches attempted to provide more challenging matches among
better, advanced athletes. Whether or not you like the premise,
Part II: Getting Recruited 
84

these teams played against the better teams from the communities,
cities, and even states for title matches. Thus, the term traveling
team was born.
Select or traveling teams do offer more challenging games to young
athletes. But another driving force behind the club movement is
prestige. Both kids and parents feel a great deal of pride in being
associated with a “select” group of athletes.
The process typically works like this: You’re invited by a coach
who has seen you play, or you may try out for a team that you’ve
heard about from other parents or through an ad. If you make the
cut, you’re asked to sign a one-year contract. This is a binding con-
tract in which your family is obligated to pay a flat-out fee or make
monthly payments to the club — fees that can cost hundreds or
thousands of dollars. The contract may also forbid you to play
with any other teams during the off season. When you’ve signed
that contract, you must adhere to the club’s practice and to game
times and places.
No scientific data proves that club ball advances young athletes to
the elite status any faster or better than recreational ball.
Scientific data aside, there is a very positive and undisputable reality
about playing select ball: You get noticed. Because college recruiters’
funds and time are limited, select tournaments allow recruiters to see
a wide variety of talent from all over the region in one place. These
games are a recruiter’s paradise. And if you’re playing select tourna-
ments, you’ll increase your chances of being seen.
Another positive of playing select or club ball is the experience.
Although recreational sport is wonderful, athletes who play select
often have a higher level of commitment. Because these athletes
have paid a higher price (literally), and are willing to travel and
train more intensely than recreational athletes, the competition
will be more fierce.
If you decide to play with a select team, you’re making a commitment
beyond the tryout and practice times. Some select teams travel
across state lines or to faraway cities. Tournaments may turn into
three-day events, which means greater food and lodging bills.
Be sure to take a look at the investments required before signing
on, including the following:
 Uniform and equipment
 Lodging and food
 Transportation
Chapter 6: The Game Begins: Getting Noticed 85

 Separate tournament fees
 Tournament T-shirts and souvenirs
Be sure to talk to other parents and athletes to determine costs
you may not have thought of.
Also consider the travel schedule to determine the hours or days
involved in individual games and weekend tournaments.
Before you try out for a club team, ask the club coach the following
questions to determine whether playing club ball is right for you:
 What will be the time requirement for you and your family?
 Does the coach give equal playtime to all the players?
 What is the team/club policy for sportsmanship? Are parents
and coaches required to sign a code of conduct as well as the
players?
 What if you miss a practice or game?
 Is there an academic standard?
 Do you have to sign an agreement? If so, what are the terms?
 What kind of experience does the coach have?
 Can the coach provide references from previous and current
players and parents?
Then ask yourself and your family the following questions:
 What will my siblings or parents have to sacrifice so that I 
can play?
 What will I have to give up so that I can play with the club?
 How will playing club ball affect my schoolwork?
 How will playing club ball affect my social life?
 How much time will I be on the road?
Be sure also to talk to your family before you join a club sport. Ask
them whether they’re all ready for the time commitment that will
be involved.
Choosing sports camps
Sports camps are an excellent place for you to showcase your
talent for coaches and recruiters, as well as to learn valuable skills
from coaches from around the nation. They’re also full-fledged
Part II: Getting Recruited 
86

businesses that offer one- and two-week sleepover camps with
intense training programs in a variety of sports, such as tennis,
soccer, basketball, and swimming.
The camps are generally held on college campuses and are run by
college coaches — an excellent way for you to be seen by that col-
lege’s coaches and recruiters, as well as to tour the campus, meet
and interact with the coaching staff, and see the athletic facilities. In
recent years, shoe and other sports-apparel companies, such as Nike
and Reebok, have begun offering select sports camps of their own.
At a sports camp, you also have an opportunity to learn from
more-skilled coaches than your high school or club coach. This is
not meant to knock your high school or club coach, but he or she
may not have had the chance to learn the coaching skills to help
you get to the next level. The coaches you’ll work with at a sports
camp likely will.
At camp, you’ll have the chance to test your skills and talents against
those of other potential college players. If you’re able to compete
well in a good camp, chances are you can play at the next level.
Attending a sports camp adds to your athletic résumé. A coach
who may be on the fence about recruiting you may be more willing
to take a chance if you’ve attended multiple camps. Going to
sports camps shows the coach you’re serious about your sport
and trying to improve your game.
Sports camps are a good way for you to continue playing in the off
season. Because most camps are held in the summer, they can give
you an opportunity to work on your skills at a time when you may
not otherwise be able to. Most high school associations have rules
against organized practice and/or competition during the summer,
so camps may be the only way for you to play in a competitive set-
ting during the summer.
On the downside, camps can be very stressful, with undue pres-
sure from expectant, demanding coaches, parents, or fellow team-
mates. They can also be very expensive and time consuming.
The most popular reason for attending a sports camp is recruiting.
Attending a camp may get your foot in the door at a college that
otherwise might not know who you are. This can especially be the
case for a small Division I school or one in Division II or III, where
the recruiting budgets are scarce. Specialty camps, or position
camps (for example, a quarterback camp in football), can be a
great way for you to showcase your talents because those camps
are generally used only for recruiting purposes by coaches.

Working with the coach
Deion Branch of the New England Patriots called all his coaches
hours before he was named MVP of Super Bowl XXXIX. He called
all the Little League, high school, recreational, and college coaches
he ever had to thank them for the time and dedication they gave
him while he was growing up. Without them, he said, his dream of
playing in the “greatest show on earth” would not have been possi-
ble. Branch’s coaches served him as guidance counselors, educa-
tors, personal trainers, and motivators. The message from Deion
Branch is that, whether you’re working with a recreational coach, a
club or select coach, or a sports-camp coach, view it as a learning
experience.
Like every athlete, coaches have their strengths and weaknesses.
You don’t have to like your coach, but you must respect the posi-
tion of the coach on your team.
Learning from your coach
Coaches wear many hats. Not only must they strategize games,
calls plays, and organize games and/or staff, but they’re also
responsible for teaching you how to deal with pressure before and
during games or matches. They instill a strong work ethic and
must figure out what motivates you.
While you play at the club or select level, your coach asks far more of
you than the typical recreational coach may. But remember that you
may also expect more from your coach. You’re paying for a service —
make sure you get your (or your parents’) money’s worth.
In club sports, the coach often works directly with or has personal
contact with many college recruiters. Not only can successful
select coaches get recruiters to come watch a game or practice,
but they also can also tell you what recruiters are looking for. From
the way you warm up to the way you behave on the sidelines,
recruiters know what they want, and your select coach can help
guide you in the right direction.
As you begin to think about what college you would like to attend
or dream about your collegiate future, talk to your coach. If you’re
a freshman in high school, your coach may give more instructional
advice on athletic strategy. But if you’re a junior, ask your coach
about his or her own experience with college recruiters. What
should you ask when speaking with a recruiter? How do you get
recruiters to notice you? What are your strongest and weakest
points on — and off — the field?
Part II: Getting Recruited 
88

Your coach is dealing with a variety of personalities on the team:
the extroverts, the introverts, the show-offs, the wallflowers, the
easily discouraged, and the overly confident. Don’t demand his or
her full attention. Choose your time carefully. Ask to set up a time
to speak one on one with your coach — and listen to what he or
she has to say.
By learning to accept criticism, and following and carrying through
instructions, you’ll become the kind of athlete coaches enjoy most.
Here are some things you don’t want to do with your coach:
 Nag or complain about playtime
 Pout when the game doesn’t go the way you want
 Gloat over a successful shot or awesome throw
 Call positions you think you should play
 Make excuses when you’re corrected
Is this the coach for me?
Despite your best efforts, there are times when you and your
coach simply don’t mesh. It may be a matter of miscommunication
or differing personality types.
Ask yourself the following questions to determine whether this
coach is the right one for you:
 What is his or her philosophy on winning? Is it “Win at 
all costs”?
 What is my philosophy on winning? Does it mesh with the
coach’s philosophy?
 Is my coach a role model?
 Does my team respect this coach?
 What do my coach’s peers think of him or her?
 Is safety important to my coach?
 Is he or she trained to deal with injuries?
 Why does he or she coach?
If you aren’t satisfied with the answers you receive, talk to other
athletes and parents. A coach and athlete may knock heads from
time to time but be able to work through their differences. But if
the coach and coaching staff have a completely different sports
philosophy from yours, it may be time to step away and find a new
school or coach.
Chapter 6: The Game Begins: Getting Noticed 89

You cannot and will not develop as an athlete if you’re miserable
where you are.
Before signing with a select team, consider the coach and his or
her reputation. All too often, both parents and student-athletes are
so excited to have made the team, they forget that there was actu-
ally a “second tryout.” What’s the second tryout? As you go out for
a club or select team, you aren’t the only one trying out. Your
coach and the club must also impress you. You shouldn’t care
about a club because your best friend is playing in it — you have
to consider your select team as you will a college. It’s not about
team colors or friends. This is about top-level competition, and
you need to consider the experience and reputation of your coach.
Just as you hope to get a scholarship to college so that you may
earn a higher education, you’re getting an education (of another
sort) from your select coach.
Don’t be embarrassed or shy about investigating the club or select
coach. Check references. Talk to other parents and players. Ask the
coach for his coaching résumé.
Working with Your Parents
Just as you have a very specific role you need to play as an athlete,
your parents have very specific roles they need to play in your
sport. In this section, we provide some guidelines for parents.
Parents should
 Teach their kids sportsmanship.
 Teach their kids integrity.
 Offer financial support.
 Offer emotional support. Be a good cheerleader!
 Work with the coach or team. Parents can contribute to the
team by doing anything from making phone calls to driving
other players when they don’t have a ride to a scheduled
practice or game.
 Find out more about the coach and/or league. Check their
safety guidelines and zero-tolerance policy.
Parents should not:
 Expect more playtime for their kid
 Demand more coaching time for their kid

The stage mom: How aggressive 
parents can cause a foul
We’ve all seen the headlines in recent years. A father knocks down his son’s foot-
ball teammate after a disagreement between the boys. A mother heckles an injured
soccer player during a match between 8-year-old girls until an enraged father
punches her in the face, clearing both sidelines; police have to be called to sepa-
rate the parents. A father beats his son’s hockey coach with hockey sticks when he
disagrees with a coaching decision. A tee-ball game erupts into a full-blown brawl
over an umpire’s call. A father attacks a fellow parent during a game. The list goes
on and on. And while everyone was deeply saddened, no one was particularly sur-
prised when a father in Massachusetts beat another man to death over a disagree-
ment during a boys’ recreational-hockey practice. Many sports fans have asked over
and over, “Why is this happening?” The easy answer is entitlement and rage.
Parents devote an enormous amount of time and energy to their children’s hopes
and athletic dreams. More important, far too many parents connect their own per-
sonal hopes and dreams to the athletic abilities of their children. They live vicari-
ously through their children and expect greatness. In time, parents begin to feel a
powerful sense of entitlement: We deserve this! You deserve better! You should be
playing more! You’re one of the best players on the team — why doesn’t your coach
use you more often?
With this kind of thinking comes the idea that parents should have more input with
the team, with how the games are run and how the coach thinks. But the reality is
that only a select group of kids will wear the celebrated high school varsity jersey.
Fewer will ever be offered an athletic scholarship, and even fewer will eventually
make the pros. These are hard facts for parents to accept.
In Coaching Kids For Dummies, Rick Wolff discusses how to deal with difficult par-
ents, placing them in categories from the “know-it-all” and “loud-mouth” to the
“comparer” and “flatterer.” Wolff identifies what college coaches and recruiters
have known for some time: There are certain parents who need to be avoided or
appropriately dealt with. Although coaches have learned to walk the fine line
between encouraging parents to participate and risking parents’ running the game,
this is not a problem you want to have if you’re being considered by a school. From
recreational ball to high school or select sports, a parent can be a deal-breaker,
and coaches have been known to pass on a star athlete because of his or her par-
ents’ behavior.
After two years of recreational soccer, a very gifted center forward left her team to
play club ball. The athlete had been a strong force for the team, and her absence
was felt quickly. The following season, the team lost the majority of its games, and
parents worried that the girls would be downhearted. After the fourth straight loss,
the coach met with the parents and players to talk about their future.
(continued)

 Make plays or offer their own ideas for a lineup
 Talk to the officials
 Talk negatively to the parents of the opposing team
 Compare their kid to their kid’s teammates
A scholarship is truly a gift that is often overlooked or unappreci-
ated. Often, parents overestimate their kids’ abilities and expect a
slew of scholarship offers. Full scholarships are rare (except in
football, basketball, and certain women’s sports at the upper
Division I level), so parents should be careful when attempting to
persuade a student to turn down a partial scholarship in hopes of
being offered a larger one later.
Maximizing Your Exposure
Like the behavior of your parents and coaches, how you conduct
yourself is critical in the game of college recruiting. You have to
think of yourself in business terms.
Not many years ago, a young man began his own taxi service to help
pay for college. We like the idea of supporting an enthusiastic, up-
and-coming businessman, but there was a problem. The bumper
sticker on the back of his cab read:
THERE’S A PARTY IN MY PANTS
AND EVERYONE IS COMING!
You have to wonder: What kind of image was this guy trying to sell?
Part II: Getting Recruited 
92
He began the discussion by saying, “Now, I know we all miss Monica.” To his sur-
prise, not only did the parents disagree, but so did the players. The girls unanimously
agreed that while they liked the girl, they hadn’t missed her because her parents
caused so much stress and distraction to the team. The girls said that, although they
were losing, they were enjoying the sport more than ever. One season later, the
coach attended a tournament and stopped to watch his old player, Monica. Nothing
had changed, he noted, as he watched the girl’s parents scream and berate Monica,
her teammates, and the officials. After the game, he spoke to the club coach to see
how Monica was doing. “Nothing is worth this. I don’t care how good she is — she
won’t be playing with us next season.”
(continued)

You are your brand name. Beyond your athletic abilities, you want
to find a strategy that makes you different and memorable (but you
don’t want to be remembered for having a party in your pants).
Hard work alone won’t get potential colleges to take notice. You
have to promote yourself, and in this section, we show you how.
Thinking outside the box 
or beyond the game
Getting a college scholarship is about much more than how fast
you can run or how high you can leap. It’s also about commitment,
strategy, phone calls, interviews, and follow-ups. In short, you
need to create your own business plan. You need to ask yourself a
series of questions about your future goals, just as a businessper-
son might do.
Sit down with your parents, guardians, or coach, and honestly
answer these questions:
 What would you most like to do with your life?
 Where are you now?
 How can you achieve your goals?
 What is your time frame?
 What kind of networking system do you have?
Chapter 6: The Game Begins: Getting Noticed 93
The one that got away
While working at the NCAA, co-author Pat Britz fielded many phone calls from angry
parents about lost scholarship deals. In one instance, a parent called, angry
because a school that offered a verbal commitment later declined a scholarship.
The parent was upset because she (and her son) had previously withdrawn a verbal
commitment to a smaller school when the other school came a-knockin’. Suddenly,
they were without any offer at all. The parent turned to the NCAA for assistance,
but there was none to be given — the parent let the big one get away in her quest
to get something even bigger!
You can easily believe the initial hype when colleges show interest: “They want me!
I’m the best!” But the reality is this: Colleges are simply looking around to see what
and who is out there. The early stages of recruitment are quite similar to trying out
for a club or select team. This is the tryout phase. Don’t rule anyone out; don’t over-
estimate your abilities or appeal; and never disregard another player.

 How can you gain access to the information you need?
 What are the costs?
 What are the risks?
 What is the payoff?
 Who may be interested in you as a student-athlete?
By answering these questions, you’ll have taken the first steps to
promoting yourself in a timely, organized fashion. You’ll know who
is willing to help, what schools to focus on, what deadlines you
need to meet, and what you really want.
If you’re like most student-athletes, the one question that you’d
rather not have to answer is “What are the risks?” There are several:
 You could fail.
 You may not be offered a scholarship after all.
 You’ll have to talk to people about yourself.
 You’ll have to take the initiative, calling up strangers to dis-
cuss your athletic feats.
 You may feel very intimidated or embarrassed.
Picking up the phone: Don’t be
afraid to do PR
You’ve put in hours and hours on your jump shot, slap shot,
corner kick, swing, or long jump. You understand the importance
of “practice makes perfect.” Networking (talking to and getting to
know people who can help you reach your goals) is no different —
you’ll get better the more you practice.
Networking is an extremely important aspect of the college recruit-
ing process. Too many student-athletes overlook the importance of
networking, probably because it requires overcoming fear — fear
of exposure, rejection, or obligation.
In this section, we show you how to make your network work 
for you.
Networking the sports community
A big mistake student-athletes make is not sharing information. Their
thinking is “I don’t want anyone else to know what I’m doing. They
might get ahead of me.” But when you share information with other
Part II: Getting Recruited 
94

athletes, teammates, and parents, you actually create more opportu-
nities for yourself.
The sporting world is a small community built around a shared
interest. While writing this book, we met numerous coaches, train-
ers, counselors, athletic directors, parents, and athletes who
wanted to share their interest and knowledge. Sports folks like to
talk about athletics and athletes.
This behavior works two ways:
 If you misbehave, coaches and others will talk about you.
Coaches have a great memory when it comes to recruiting
time.
 If you share and ask for information, sports people will talk to
you, sharing their expertise and supporting young athletes’
efforts.
Expecting paybacks: Don’t!
Part of sharing in a network requires
 Faith in the importance of being generous
 Knowledge that what you have is worth sharing
Don’t calculate your actions for rewards — don’t always think “If I
do X, then Y will happen.” Exchange information because it is the
right thing to do. You’ll earn a reputation as a student-athlete who
is open, honest, and fair. When you do this, your networking rela-
tionships will grow. Your cooperative and helpful attitude will bring
you more paybacks than you could ever get by scheming or hold-
ing out.
Playing phone tag
Part of networking means that you have things that others want,
and they have things that you want. A recruiter is interested in
having you play for his or her school. You want a scholarship, and
you hope to wear the colors of your choice.
But this relationship doesn’t always mean that both parties have to
be active in the relationship at the same time. For example, you call
a recruiter who is talking to several athletes at the same time. At this
point, the recruiter is digesting information and trying to decide
who the better student-athlete would be to represent the college.
You want the recruiter’s full attention, but you have to wait for a
decision or further conversation when the recruiter has more time.
Chapter 6: The Game Begins: Getting Noticed 95

Stalking or bombarding the recruiter with phone calls won’t work
to your advantage. All you can do is thank the recruiter for his time
and carry on. Tag. Now he’s it.
One day, one week, or one month later — no matter how long it’s
been, the recruiter may call back. Now you have something the
recruiter wants. You’ve been noticed, and the game moves on.
Making cold calls
The cold-call relationship can be with a complete stranger or
someone you knew before but only now recognize as someone
with potential for future contacts. Your cold-call contact can be a
recruiter, journalist, coach, teammate, or parent. What you hope to
do is turn the cold call into a more personal contact — someone
with whom you share information and through whom you can
expand your network.
Get out the Rolodex cards, and start making notations of names,
addresses, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses. Make notes to
yourself about people, their titles, and personal information you
may have gathered (special interests, names of family members,
special events), and note the best times to contact each person.
Developing relationships with coaches, trainers, and local media is
a great way to expand your contacts, gain valuable inside informa-
tion, and get your name out in front!
Creating your own portfolio
Most student-athletes give recruiters their college applications,
résumés, and highlight tapes when meeting recruiters. Then they
cross their fingers and hope they’ve given the recruiters enough
information.
But you’re not most student-athletes. You’re going to create an
impressive portfolio that leaves no doubt in the mind of any coach
or recruiter that you’re the best choice to wear his or her school
colors.
Buy a leather-bound portfolio (you can get one in any office retail
store, starting from $30) to hold all your vital information. Here’s
what you want to put inside the portfolio:
 Awards: Place all certificates of achievement you’ve earned in
the front of the portfolio so that they’re the first things people
see. Make copies of these certificates, and keep them in a sep-
arate file.
Part II: Getting Recruited 
96

 Articles: Whether it’s a mention in the local paper naming you
along with your teammates or an entire article dedicated to
your athletic achievements, fill the portfolio with these acco-
lades. Be sure to put the best headlines in front. Again, make
copies for your records.
 Statistics: You may be sure that the coaches or recruiters
already have this information, but include your stats with the
portfolio package. They’re something to be proud of, and you
want to show what you’ve done.
 Sports-camp/club-ball certifications: Include this information
as another way to show your commitment, time, and dedica-
tion to a sport you love. You’re not a prima donna — you’re
the real deal!
 Academic achievements: This includes your grades and a list
of extracurricular activities that will set you apart from your
competition. Did you win an art contest? Compete in a science
fair? Join the chess club? Colleges like to see a well-rounded
student who can bring more than just great hand–eye coordi-
nation to the school.
 Letters of recommendation: Ask your coach, trainers, team
managers, school counselors, and teachers to write letters of
recommendation. These letters should mention your work
ethic as an athlete and as a student. Again, recruiters like to
know that they’re dealing with a team player — someone who
can follow directions, take criticism, lift team morale, and be
counted on as a leader. This list of letter-writers can also include
parents of fellow teammates, your spiritual leader, and tutors.
 Virtual records: Include any copies of highlight films, pictures,
or videos that showcase your best work (see the “Putting
together highlight films” section, later in this chapter).
If possible, make copies of articles and letters so that you can
leave material with whomever you meet. Remember: You’re your
own brand name. Nike has the swoosh, Starbucks has the green-
headed lady with flowing hair, and For Dummies has the black-and-
yellow cover. These images are universally recognized! But you can
create your own image. Reinforce your image by leaving some
copies of your information in the hands of everyone you can.
Corresponding with coaches
Even if you’re ready to take it to the next level, you can’t assume
coaches will know this or will be able to find you. Don’t wait for
coaches to find you. NCAA rules or financial restrictions may hold
them back, so you can make the first move if necessary.
Chapter 6: The Game Begins: Getting Noticed 97

Presenting the letter and questionnaire
As a general rule, because coaches are not permitted to contact
you in writing until September 1 of your junior year in high school,
you may have to take the first step by sending a letter, e-mailing, or
completing a questionnaire (which you can find on the school’s
athletics Web site). The main purpose of such correspondence is
to give the coach enough information so she knows you’re talented
enough and have the grades to be eligible for and be admitted to
the school.
You may find questionnaires on most college athletics Web sites.
These are generally sport-specific and can be found in the menu
for the particular sport in which you’re interested, but some are
generic and can be found on the recruiting page of the Web site.
Completing this questionnaire almost always guarantees a
response; if you complete a questionnaire, you may not need to
send an initial introduction letter, because most of the information
you would put in the letter will be asked on the questionnaire.
If you’re completing the questionnaire prior to September 1 of your
junior year, don’t be surprised if you receive a generic letter from
the coach thanking you for your interest and letting you know he’ll
be in touch as soon as he’s allowed to do so. Eventually, you’ll
probably get a response stating the coach’s interest level and what
your chances of making the team actually are. Either way, sending
a quick thank-you note or e-mail to the coach can go a long way.
If you’re interested in a big Division I school, don’t be surprised if
it’s not as easy to find contact information (phone number, e-mail)
for coaches. Most of these schools have a list of individuals they
want to recruit, and they try to limit the contact they get from
prospects who probably aren’t gifted enough to play there. If you
have trouble finding the coach’s contact info, a simple phone call
to the main athletics department phone number will do the trick.
Ask the operator for the best way to get in contact with the coach.
The operator may also be able to tell you where the information is
online, in case you just overlooked it.
If you can’t find a questionnaire on the school’s Web site, you
should write a letter of interest to the coach. Your letter should be
concise and to the point. You want to provide the coach with the
vital information about you. The letter should include
 The position you play and a brief description of your success
and athletic qualifications
 Your academic credentials and the field of study in which
you’re interested (don’t worry — you can change your mind)
Part II: Getting Recruited 
98

 Your highlight tape or DVD (see the “Putting together high-
light films” section, later in this chapter)
 The fact that you’re familiar with the program and its recent
successes or troubles
 A request for the coach to respond
You may be amazed at how much time and energy you can save a
coach with such a simple letter. The coach should now be able to
make a good estimate of your ability to be part of his program
without ever leaving the office. Coaches like this.
Be sure to proofread your letter. Nothing can turn off a coach more
than having a letter sent to her with the name of another school,
the name of another coach, or misspelled words on it.
Don’t be discouraged if you don’t hear back from the coach. The
coach has probably received hundreds of letters just like yours
and may not have the time to respond to each one or may already
be recruiting people for your position that she’s seen play in
person. In fact, many coaches are known to wait for a follow-up
phone call from the prospect to see how interested you really are.
Just because you send a letter doesn’t put you at the top of the
coach’s list. Chances are you’re still an anonymous player at this
point, so the coach will need a more convincing reason to recruit
you over the other players she may already be tracking.
Don’t assume that the coach received the letter. Letters can get
lost or mishandled, or can simply fall behind a desk. Checking up
on the status of the letter can be enough of a reason to place a
follow-up phone call.
Putting together highlight films
When they’re able, coaches and their staff will review as many
highlight films as possible to create the best team they can.
Remember the key word: highlight. You must choose a winning run,
shot, or throw that best illustrates your abilities as an athlete.
Keep it brief. Think ESPN’s “Play of the Week” segments. Coaches
don’t have time to watch an entire game or event. They’ll lose
interest and move on to another prospect.
Appreciating the Role of the Media
Baseball’s volatile Barry Bonds has had an ongoing feud with the
media. Few sports fans have missed his continued complaints that
Chapter 6: The Game Begins: Getting Noticed 99

the media have unfairly ridiculed and berated him for his behavior
with fellow teammates and fans. After his testimony about steroids
was leaked to the press, he lashed out once more, calling reporters
liars.
Whatever you think of Bonds or how he’s been treated by the
press, we assure you that he once used every press clipping, every
write-up, every interview to wow recruiters and coaches at both
the collegiate and professional levels. The point is, you need the
press. Use it wisely.
Maximizing your 15 minutes of fame
The press has certainly earned a bad reputation over the years,
particularly when reporters crowd the locker room after a bad
play, asking athletes to relive the moment. This experience is a
frustrating one, and nobody wants to have his slip-up highlighted.
But take a lesson from Bonds: Don’t overreact. Don’t whine. Don’t
complain. Respectfully answer the questions, remembering that
the reporters are simply retelling a story the fans want to know.
Take it in stride, and know that better days are coming.
And if you are the MVP, grab hold of the spotlight. Don’t avoid or
dodge reporters out of embarrassment. You don’t have to jump up
and down in front of cameras. Simply smile, answer the questions,
and enjoy the moment.
You’ve got 15 minutes — ready, set, go! How do you want to use
that time? Whether it’s a local match or a state championship, this
is your time to meet the press and talk to individual reporters, pro-
viding as much information as possible.
Your parents can be extremely helpful, making sure the reporter gets
the proper spelling of your name, your jersey number, other stats,
and any personal information that might make a great storyline.
Be sure to mention fellow teammates who assisted in a specific
play, and compliment the entire team effort and the coaching staff.
Getting what you want printed
Every day, reporters around the world receive phone calls from
well-meaning parents and athletes. They want a story in the news-
paper about the budding athlete. But frequently, when asked for
their pitch (story idea), they’ve got nothing. “Well, he’s really, really
good at hockey.”
Part II: Getting Recruited 
100

“Really, really good” doesn’t sell copies. “ATHLETE OVERCOMES
LEARNING DISABILITY TO PLAY STARTING POSITION,” “LOCAL ATHLETE
DEDICATED TO COMMUNITY SERVICE,” “HOMELESS STUDENT HITS WINNING RUN
IN BASEBALL AND EDUCATION” — those are headlines that sell copies.
Whether you’ll graduate early, you help senior citizens in your
spare time, you fix computers for extra dollars, you’re an avid
chess player, or you secretly enjoy knitting, you must have a story
that will make you more personable and add to the sports angle.
Reporters have deadlines and must move quickly. If you don’t
return phone calls or offer enough information, they’ll move on to
the next story. An, ultimately, the story is in the hands of an editor.
The reporter doesn’t always get to write about what she wants, so
your story has to be compelling enough to interest the editor who
has not met you — or maybe even heard of you.
Working Mom and Dad as Your
Public Relations Firm
A good public relations director will work to keep his client in the
spotlight, in the game, and attending all the main events. The PR
parent needs to have that same agenda.
Choosing what’s on the agenda
Parents can help by making and keeping an agenda. If your parents
know the calendar of events for college applicants, athletic schol-
arships, and recruiter guidelines, you’ll be ahead of the game.
Parents can create their own press kit, which should include
 College/scholarship application deadlines and notifica-
tion dates.
 Testing dates and times.
 A filing system of addresses for colleges and coaches.
 A personal information package that includes your Social
Security number, academic records, medical history, and ath-
letic statistics. (It’s helpful if your parents can answer ques-
tions such as what sports camps you’ve attended or what
awards you’ve earned.)
 Copies of your test scores.
Chapter 6: The Game Begins: Getting Noticed 101

Keep all these important papers together.
Although having a calendar of events to mark your personal calen-
dar with is nice, you don’t have to wait for schools to publish any-
thing. You or your PR parent can also check out scholarship Web
sites, such as www.fastweb.com, for a free Internet scholarship
that will match you with a scholarship that best suits your aca-
demic, athletic, and financial needs.
Beware of scholarship search services that make guarantees or
require fees. Numerous legitimate services offer free advice and
information about the latest and greatest scholarships. Use the
services designed to help young athletes, rather than those
focused on making a profit.
How to help, not hinder
You’ll always find pushy parents on the playing field. Just as these
parents can be annoying to coaches, the pushy PR parent can be
equally troublesome. Parents can easily convince themselves that
their kid is being overlooked, ignored, or underestimated. They
tend to adopt the philosophy “Well, if they won’t listen, we’ll make
them listen!” The squeaky wheel gets the grease, right? But some-
times, a squeaky wheel is just really annoying.
Relentless phone calls and letters to reporters, recruiters, and
coaches will not endear you to anyone.
The opposite problem is the parents who simply wait too long to
act on behalf of their kids. Afraid of being too intrusive, these par-
ents simply let deadlines come and go. Although you don’t want
loud, aggressive parents, you do need strong team players. Talk to
your parents, plan with them, and work with them to build an
effective PR effort.
Working as a team
Okay, so your parents or guardians are on board, and Team
Scholarship is ready to rock! Recruiters have taken notice; coaches
are talking; you’re having the best season of your life; the local
media has written some nice pieces about you; and you’re ready to
take it to the next level. But is your team ready?
Part II: Getting Recruited 
102

Ask your parents:
 Do they really believe you can get a scholarship?
 Do they have time as a family to create Team Scholarship?
 Is this appropriate for the family?
 Are they ready to create a PR packet, contact coaches, and
deal with the media?
 Are they willing to help you research schools and Web sites?
 Are they willing or able to travel?
If the answers are yes, and Team Scholarship is ready to go, create
your PR checklist. Network and share information. Research the
schools you’re interested in, looking at each school’s records, loca-
tion, and academic standards. Take a serious look at your parents’
behavior during games and with other parents. Be media savvy,
and use the Web to find out more about scholarship services and
marketing ideas.
Here’s a PR checklist you can use as a good starting point:
 Set your goal. What is your final objective? (If you don’t set a
goal, how will you achieve it?)
 Understand the market. How can you best sell yourself and
your name?
 Research. Find out how other athletes — perhaps your 
teammates — have successfully marketed themselves with
the local press and recruiters.
 Identify your resources. What resources can you use to learn
more about the marketing and recruiting process? With whom
can you network?
 Make lists. Write down and continuously check out various
books, Web sites, and services. Don’t just look once and 
walk away.
 Create a Rolodex of all your contacts. Network, network, 
network.
 Play the PR agent. Hone your people skills, and learn to sell
your story, successes, and potential.
 Restate your agenda. Continuously remind Team Scholarship
why you’re doing this and what the goal is.
Chapter 6: The Game Begins: Getting Noticed 103

It’s never too early to begin researching schools and coaches. The
more people you talk to and the more questions you ask, the more
easily you’ll be able to pinpoint what it is you want from a college
and where you hope to go.
But don’t panic if you don’t know yet. Many young athletes worry
because they don’t yet have a precise top-ten list of the schools
they want to attend. You may get offered an athletic scholarship 
to a college you never even thought about. By discussing your
options with your parents and working the media angle, however,
you’ll open as many doors as possible.

H
ave you ever bought a car? Or at least been around to watch a
parent or sibling buy one? On the surface, the process appears
to be pretty straightforward, and it’s very similar to choosing a col-
lege: You pick the model or make you like (a type of college), visit a
few dealerships (campuses), and talk to salespeople (recruiters and
staff) to get a feel for what you want and need. When you know what
you want, you ask for a test drive (the official campus visit), kick the
tires (try the cafeteria food), and then begin the negotiation process.
But if you’re sharp, you know there is much more than that to
buying a car. For instance, some dealerships are overstocked and
need to sell, whereas others may not negotiate on the sticker price.
Dealerships often have end-of-the-month or end-of-the-quarter
sales quotas that may allow you more room for haggling. You need
to shop and compare, know the blue-book value on a car, and con-
sider gas mileage and the practicality of a car before buying in.

Choosing a college is no different. Each year you’re in high school
is about more than the curriculum that your teachers want you to
learn. As you play sports as a sophomore, junior, and senior, you
and everyone involved in your athletic career must follow certain
guidelines. In this chapter, we fill you in.
Vying for the Sophomore
You become something of a prospect at the beginning of your 
freshman year. The wheels are in motion. But you’re only likely to
become a real prospect in the recruiting game as a sophomore.
What does this mean? If recruiters haven’t identified you as a
prospective college athlete by your sophomore (or early junior)
year, there is a good chance that you may never be looked at
closely without aggressive marketing by your family.
You’re not alone if this comes as a huge surprise to you and your
parents. All too often, we hear about parents and athletes who are
considering the scholarships and recruiting game only at the end
of the junior year. In most cases, if you wait ’til you’re a junior,
you’re behind the game. Although you may only be finding your
academic groove as a sophomore, this is a pivotal year for you as
college-athlete-to-be.

So soon, so fast
By the age of 12, world-champion rock climber and pole vaulter Tori Allen had her aca-
demic and athletic career planned. “By my sophomore year,” says Allen, “I knew what
I needed to do, where I needed to go. I know I’m competing against other athletes
who have their athletic careers planned out, so I have to be just as organized, if not
more. If I’m going to be the best, I have to plan everything in the best way possible.”
Just as Olympic athletes prepare and train four years in advance of the chance to
try out for a position on a national team, so must the high school athlete who has col-
legiate aspirations. The games start now, not next year. Sports camps around the
nation are reaching out to, training, and profiling students as young as 10 and 12
years old. And while the debate rages on among educators, parents, coaches, and
boosters on the ethics of these practices, the competition is heating up.
Colleges are already reviewing new talent, identifying those prospects who fit their
needs and weeding out those who don’t. Remarkably, a high school athlete can be
cut from a college recruiter’s prospect list without even knowing it. In Chapter 6, we
fill you in on ways to market yourself effectively and keep your name out in front,
which are critical to staying in the game.

Letters of promise: What they 
really mean
Receiving a letter in the mail that makes promises of academic
and/or athletic advancement can be very exciting and confusing.
But does acknowledging such a letter mean that you’re committed
to a particular school? Should you respond immediately to the first
school that writes? More important, is it a letter or a questionnaire?
When you’re a sophomore, the first two questions can be answered
with a simple “No.” Colleges are not allowed to contact you by mail
before September 1 of your junior year except in the sport of
Division I men’s basketball (in which you can start to receive mail
from colleges after June 15 of your sophomore year). Before that
date, you shouldn’t even have to deal with any letters of promise.
What you may receive as a sophomore is a questionnaire. This is
the college’s way of expressing interest in you — nothing more. The
college is checking you out, and you’re checking out the college. By
filling out the questionnaire and promptly sending it back, you’re
letting the coaching staff know that you’re interested in their pro-
gram. After you return the questionnaire, the coaching staff will
likely begin to follow your high school athletic achievements.
Although you don’t have to fill out a questionnaire, we highly rec-
ommend that you do. You’re in a pool with hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of equally talented athletes. But for argument’s sake,
let’s say that in the entire nation, there are only two other athletes
equal to your own abilities. The other two athletes fill out their
questionnaires and send them back in. Their response was courte-
ous, prompt, and enthusiastic. But the college recruiter hasn’t
heard from you. Come decision time, who do you think will be
dropped first?
One of the most violated rules in the NCAA just may be the letter
sent by an overzealous recruiter to a prospect before his or her
junior year of high school. Be warned: You could be subject to
penalties under NCAA guidelines, and you definitely don’t want to
mess with the God of Collegiate Sports!
Even by receiving mail from recruiters before your eligibility
status, you can unwittingly be violating NCAA guidelines. If you
receive any mail or phone calls before your junior year, be sure to
forward all communication to your coach, letting him or her
explain your current status to the recruiter. By working closely
with your coach, you’ll also be able to clarify the difference
between letters of recruitment and questionnaires (forms of stan-
dard questions about you and your sports involvement).
Chapter 7: The Full-Court Press 107

Table 7-1 provides the NCAA rules about who can contact you in
your sophomore year. In the table, you’ll notice a few terms you
need to be familiar with:
 Off-campus contact: This is contact such as letters, phone
calls, or in-home visits.
 Official visit: An NCAA-approved visit on campus that allows
you to meet with the coaching staff and discuss your future
with a specific college.
 Unofficial visit: A visit you make to any college on your own
dime and time.
Enjoy the ride: Keep on pedaling
Something important happens to the high school sophomore who
has two or more letters of interest or questionnaires from college
recruiters. Although high school coaches and guidance counselors
assure you that you need to stay focused on academics and con-
tinue to play strong and with confidence, you and your family often
hear something else: “It’s in the bag.” “It’s only a matter of time
before we make you a firm offer.” “Sit back and enjoy the ride.”
High school is not the time to become a prima donna. Coaches
have very little time or interest for that kind of attitude — even
less for the high school student who has yet to prove his worth on
the field. The enjoy-the-ride theory often lands an otherwise-strong
high school athlete in the weeded-out pile.
Your sophomore and junior years are critical legs of the path to a
college athletic experience for the high school athlete. Don’t sit by
as the chance for the real ride of a lifetime passes you by.
We’ve often heard that a high school coach is able to seal the deal
with a specific college. In truth, most high school coaches are full-
time teachers in charge of an entire team of 20 to 50 athletes. They,
too, are overwhelmed — so relying upon your coach to manage
your deal of a lifetime isn’t smart. Your coach can write letters of
recommendations and, in some cases, make a well-placed phone
call to an old friend, but getting the wheels rolling is up to you.

Tracking the Junior 
and Senior Rush
As a junior or senior, you understand the athletic level at which
you’re performing and just how many colleges are starting to take
notice. The level of your athletic and academic achievement will be
measured against Division I, II, and III standards. Although Division I
is considered the most competitive in sports and scholarships avail-
ability, all kinds of exceptions or surprise bonuses can be found in
the other divisions. (See Chapter 3 for more on the divisions.)
In the following sections, we help you navigate this exciting time.
The phone is ringing off the hook
Division I colleges are not allowed to send you formal correspon-
dence (that is, a letter of promise) until September 1 of your junior
year (except in the sport of men’s basketball, in which colleges
may contact you after June 15 of your sophomore year). Prior to
that date, the only documents that colleges can send are question-
naires and NCAA educational materials, such as Guide for the
College-Bound Student-Athlete.
After September 1 of your junior year, you may expect an all-out mail
war. Letters, postcards, and media guides are mailed. More com-
monly, e-mails — based on your response to the questionnaire the
schools may have sent you while you were a sophomore — are sent
as a way to establish contact. We’ve heard stories of standout ath-
letes receiving a letter a day from various schools expressing their
interest. This practice is time consuming (and costly) to the school,
and it can be overwhelming, as well as flattering, for the athlete.
Like letters, the general rule is that coaches (or athletic depart-
ment staff members) are not permitted to call you until July 1 after
your junior year, and such calls are limited to one per week. A few
exceptions to the July 1 rule exist:
Part II: Getting Recruited 
110

 Football prospects may be called one time in May during their
junior year, but not again until September 1 of their senior year.
 Women’s basketball prospects may be called one time in
April and again one time in May of their junior year. They may
be called one time between June 1 and June 20, and one time
between June 21 and June 30. Three calls may be made during
July, with no more than one call per week, and from August
forward, calls are limited to once a week.
 Men’s basketball prospects can be called once a month on or
after June 15 of their sophomore year through July 31 after
their junior year. Beginning August 1 after the junior year, two
calls per week are permitted.
In all other Division I sports, one call is permitted in March of your
junior year. For more sports-specific information, contact the
NCAA and NAIA.

The NCAA is an ever-changing, ever-evolving organization — which
means rules can change. Always be sure to talk to your coaches
and check online at www.ncaa.org to verify dates.
Part II: Getting Recruited 
116

Before those designated dates, you can call a coach at any time at
your expense. In fact, calling a coach can sometimes be beneficial.
For example, when high school senior Elizabeth Flores learned that
a fellow track athlete was being recruited by a local NAIA college
(Northwood University), she picked up the phone and called the
coach. Although her running times were not as strong as she
wished, Flores had learned that head coach Shawn Winget was
trying to build a women’s cross-country team, which gave Flores a
logical reason for her to call. Flores used that small window of time
to establish contact, earned a scholarship, and went on to be an
NAIA All-American.
On the designated dates, you can use toll-free numbers established
by the university or college in question. Most schools, and in par-
ticular the athletic departments, provide toll-free numbers for
prospective athletes.
The NCAA has a tough time monitoring whether calls are made
within the designated dates, so many athletes make toll-free calls
during their freshman, sophomore, and junior years. Just because
this is a common practice doesn’t make it okay — breaking the
rules is dangerous. According the very strict NCAA Eligibility
Guidelines, you could lose your eligibility and possible scholarship
status if you’re caught communicating with a college when you’re
not allowed to do so.
You can check the most up-to-date recruiting calendar for your
sport at www1.ncaa.org/membership/membership_svcs/
recruiting_calendars/index.html. Note the times when you
may speak to recruiters. Until then, let your on-court or on-field
actions do the talking.
What the recruiter really wants
Beyond points scored, college scouts are looking at academic
achievement, after-school and community-service activities, and
player-to-coach and teammate relationships in order to see the
whole package. With a scholarship on the line, coaches need to
know that you’ll stay in school, stay out of trouble, and remain a
viable member of the team.
Recruiters also want to be able to have intelligent conversations
with you, to understand what you want from a college and what
ideas you have for your future. We’ve spoken to many recruiters
whose chief complaint about young athletes is the “I dunno” fol-
lowed by a shrug.
Chapter 7: The Full-Court Press 117

College recruiters are trying to understand who you are. They want
to know that you’ll fit with their program. Giving them concrete
answers is always better than shrugging.
Before you speak to a recruiter, know what you want and who
you are:
 Know your current stats as an athlete (what your strengths
are on the field and what you offer to a team).
 Know your grades and class standing.
 Be able to communicate what you want academically from a
college.
 Be prepared to talk about your future and what you want or
expect.
 Be prepared to tell a recruiter what you expect from a college
and how the college in question may have what you want or
need.
In-home visits
When a coach comes to your home, you can generally assume that
he or she wants you to sign. The coach may bring a media guide
and a most recent highlight film for you to watch — this is the
coach’s turn to try to impress you.
Athletes are no longer allowed to sign in front of a coach, which
means you won’t be signing during a home visit. Even so, the
coach may still push you for a verbal commitment.
In the 1994 documentary Hoop Dreams, featuring basketball play-
ers William Gates and Arthur Agee, a college recruiter shows audi-
ences just how intense recruiting can be. Cameras follow two high
school boys in the Chicago area for five years  as the boys try to
realize their hoop dreams while struggling with school, their per-
sonal lives, and making the NBA. In one poignant scene, a recruiter
tells William Gates that if he doesn’t sign with the recruiter at that
moment, he’ll be dropped. The recruiter effectively tells Gates that
he (the recruiter) has another athlete who is interested and will
sign. Even though the recruiter has named Gates as his first
choice, he’ll drop him and pick up another player who wants it
more. Gates ends up signing.
The purpose of the in-home visit — from your perspective — is to
get to know the coach and get that personal one-on-one meeting in
which you can ask direct questions about student-athlete responsi-
bilities, what the coach expects from you, the athletic department’s
Part II: Getting Recruited 
118

goals for its students, and more. This is your time to interview the
coach.
A verbal commitment is just that — verbal. It is not a legally bind-
ing contract. Sadly, this reality has worked against many student-
athletes who believed they had a binding contract with a college
based on a verbal agreement, only to discover that there was no
scholarship offer down the road.
Although the verbal agreement is not binding, many coaches still
push for one. We recommend that you and your family make it
clear from the beginning of the meeting that you’ll need time to dis-
cuss any offer as a family — after the coach has gone. This very
reasonable demand offers you and your family time to think,
review your notes, and discuss your options without making any
hasty decisions.
Understanding the
Misunderstandings
You know the saying “Knowledge is power.” When you understand
the rules, you’re empowered to move forward and make the right
decisions for your future. Take the time to memorize the dates for
recruiting (see the tables earlier in this chapter). Revisit the official
NCAA and NAIA Web sites, and refresh your memory on rules and
regulations. And know what your recruiter wants of you.
Understanding that there will always be misunderstandings is half
the battle. As Grant Teaff, executive director of the American
Football Coaches Association, once said, “One man’s fact is
another man’s negative recruiting.” Each person has his own per-
spective of the recruiting process, which is all the more reason to
arm yourself with knowledge.
Negative recruiting
The athletic associations have strict rules about how and when
coaches can recruit (refer to Tables 7-1 through 7-4), and those
rules include a code of conduct that recruiters are expected to
uphold. Yet, every year, there are stories of improper behavior.
Money and pride are on the line. Jobs are at stake. And the thrill of
landing the supreme athlete drives some recruiters to the edge,
which can be a very gray area.
Chapter 7: The Full-Court Press 119

Recruiters have been known to discuss the downside of another
college, citing its poor geographic location, weak academic rank-
ing, party reputation, or lesser coaching staff in order to sway ath-
letes. You may find yourself sitting across the table from a recruiter
who delights in telling you all that is wrong with another college
you may be considering. What do you do? Nothing. Don’t smile.
Don’t laugh. Don’t ask the recruiter to explain why he thinks the
other college is bad or failing or otherwise inadequate. Simply do
not respond.
After the recruiter has left, you may want to research some of the
statements the recruiter made regarding that other college. But do
not engage in any anticollege conversation with another recruiter.
The collegiate world is vast, but the recruiting circles are small. As
inconceivable as it may seem, your name could easily be dragged
into a he-said/she-said situation, in which one recruiter tells another
recruiter that you weren’t such a fan of the other recruiter’s school.
If that happens, you’ve just tarnished your reputation and limited
your opportunities.
This negative wordplay is only one pitfall in the recruiting process.
High school athletes and their families can be bullied into a com-
mitment while sitting in the presence of a coach, believing that this
is the best and only offer. This situation is particularly tricky when
the athlete is alone and likely to be unwilling to fire back questions
at this adult — the expert. All the more reason for you to be
informed.
Simply put, when you’re informed, your chances of making a sound
decision without being bullied or intimidated are far greater.
Who to talk to
Every year, because of a misunderstanding, extraordinary athletes
are not recruited. In most cases, the fault lies with the student-ath-
lete, who simply didn’t understand the recruiting system. Whether
the athlete missed a deadline, didn’t take a required academic
course, or spoke to the wrong person, the bottom line is simple:
He missed out.
Your most valuable weapon is research. In addition to what we
share with you in this book, you may gather additional info from
guidance counselors, high school coaches, fellow athletes, and
recruiting agencies. Your counselor or former teammates may tell
you about mistakes they’ve seen (or made themselves), steering
you away from similar mistakes. If they’ve been in the recruiting
Part II: Getting Recruited 
120

business or have gone through the system, they can dispel rumors
or misconceptions you’ve heard about recruiting — for example,
no, it’s not okay to take a phone call from a recruiter (even in
secret) when you are a freshman; no, you shouldn’t throw away
questionnaires. Beyond that, the guidance counselor or former ath-
lete can offer you tried-and-true tips, such as their own personal
note-taking or color-coding system that will help you make final
decisions.
Approach this process much like a businessperson would. Before
beginning any business, you would review the market, see if there
is a need for your product — in this case, you’re the “product” —
and talk to other business owners who are or were in a similar
business. You’d want to know how they did, what problems they
ran into, and what advice they’re willing to offer. Being recruited is
no different.
Ensuring the Best Results
You’re standing in the locker room after the game of your life in
your senior year when a college recruiter seeks you out, thrusts
a card at you, and proclaims that you’re the superstar he’s been
searching for. It could happen. But just because there is no face-
to-face meeting in a locker room doesn’t mean you won’t get a
scholarship.
You are your own best cheerleader and supporter. Through your
own work and determination, you can make recruiters stand up
and take notice.
Toeing the line
A father of a top-ranked national track athlete walked into his living
room to hear his son talking on the phone. He listened for a moment
as his son, just a freshman, appeared to answer questions about his
grades, his latest track record, and his future. It was then that the
father stepped forward. Who was his son speaking with?
An overzealous recruiter, eager to get his hands on one of the
hottest young track athletes in the nation, had called the prospect.
When the student-athlete just set another national record, the
recruiter didn’t stop to look at the athlete’s age. Because his suc-
cess had been so overwhelming, and because so many recruiters
had expressed interest in his achievements, the student-athlete
didn’t think to say he was only a freshman.
Chapter 7: The Full-Court Press 121

When the freshman said, “Well, when I’m a junior . . .” the recruiter
instantly stopped the call, saying, “Oh, I have to turn myself in for
recruitment violation!”
As eager is everyone is to get you that college scholarship and
have you compete at the collegiate level, toeing the line is up to
you. You can and should speak with guidance counselors, teach-
ers, high school coaches, and fellow athletes, but you need to
understand the rules, time restrictions, number of visits and phone
calls, and dates allowed for the contact you have with recruiters
and coaches. Both you and the college recruiter can get into trou-
ble if one or both of you break recruiting rules.
So what about the story of the overzealous recruiter who called a
freshman? In this example, neither was aware of the mistake in the
beginning. The recruiter hadn’t properly read the material in front
of him. If he had, he would have noted that the athlete was only a
freshman. Likewise, the freshman was completely unfamiliar with
NCAA guidelines on speaking with recruiters. In this case, the
recruiter reported himself to the NCAA and received a warning. His
mistake was unintentional. No harm, no foul. But this situation
could easily have turned into a recruiting violation in which both
athlete and recruiter were penalized.
This business has one clear motto: Survival of the fittest . . . or the
most informed.
The role parents can play
Just as you’re expected to know dates and restrictions when it
comes to recruiting, you need your parents or legal guardians to
be involved in the recruiting process. Your parents are in your
corner — they’re invested in your health, your education, your
dreams, and your future. College and recruiting are big business.
Coaches are most interested in how you can help the team, and
they may overlook what’s best for you. Your family is vested in
what is best for you.
Talk to your parents about creating a filing system for your college
questionnaires, letters, and cards. Together, you can review the
history, academic records, graduation rates, geographic locations,
coaching staffs, and general impressions you have of each college
you’re interested in.
As you begin to wade through all the letters and questionnaires, talk-
ing with your family about all this will certainly help you make more-
sound decisions. But you may also want to delegate important roles
Part II: Getting Recruited 
122

to your parents or guardians. By having someone else in your
corner, you can feel more at ease about all the new rules and about
the strangers contacting you.
During the school year or at summer sports camps, you may be
approached by an agent who is interested in representing you in
commercial endorsements or who promises to get you into a big-
name school. As tempting as the agent’s offer may sound, leave
this conversation for your parents. NCAA rules don’t prohibit you
from talking to such a person, but you could easily lose eligibility
status if you enter into any kind of written or verbal commitment
with an agent. (For more information about recruiting and agent
services, see Chapter 8.)
Here’s a list of other things your parents can help you with:
 Your parents can create index cards or a checklist with impor-
tant phone numbers and names of various coaches. When the
rules allow it, you can use this information to contact various
coaches or colleges.
 Your parents can organize a travel plan for the unofficial and
official visits you make.
 Your parents can create a checklist of all the questionnaires
you’ve filled out and mailed back, including a ranking system
of which schools are most important to you and why.
 Your parents may also search the Internet for information on
colleges you’re interested in but that have not yet contacted
you. Remember: Just because they haven’t sent you a letter of
interest doesn’t mean you can’t contact them.
What Recruiters Wish
You Understood
We’ve talked to parents, athletes, and coaches from all different
sports and divisions, asking what some of the most common mis-
understandings are between recruiters and athletes.
Recruiters wish that both parents and athletes were more informed
about the recruiting process. They also wish that parents under-
stood that just because an athlete receives a number of letters from
schools, that doesn’t mean the athlete is being recruited. As one
recruiter put it, “Parents will say, ‘My kid is being recruited by 18
different schools.’ No, you’ve got letters of interest, but you’re not
being recruited.” This distinction is an important one.
Chapter 7: The Full-Court Press 123

The act of being recruited can come only when you’re eligible
both academically and within the time frame for your sport (see
Tables 7-1 through 7-4).
Letters of interest are simply feelers that colleges put out to see
which students might be interested in their college programs. The
letters of interest are simply the first play in a very long game.
Recruiters want athletes to take the process of recruiting into their
own hands. When you know the system, when you know what’s at
stake, and when you understand the rules and regulations, you’ll be
far more appealing to recruiters. You’ll also make fewer mistakes.
Know what you’re getting into, and there should be no surprises.

What to Do If You Don’t
Get Noticed
In This Chapter
 Knowing how you can play without a scholarship
 Understanding the benefits of being a walk-on athlete
 Talking about possible scholarships
 Researching and using recruiting services
N
ot every successful high school athlete simply transitions
from local phenom to Division I greatness. Instead, you can
find plenty of examples of high school athletes with talents unrec-
ognized by recruiters who nonetheless persevered to make a col-
lege team and then gained scholarships. There are also high school
athletes who seemed slated for greatness yet never really rose to
the recruiter’s expectations. Some had dreams of Division I glory
but actually played Division III, while others specifically went for a
Division III school after declining offers from Division I.
What makes these athletes successful is how they played when
they got to college. In college, coaches don’t care how the athlete
got to the team; they just want to know what he or she will do with
the opportunity. If it turns out that a talented athlete is willing to
work hard, there will be a place on the roster. And that place could
be yours.
Playing without an Athletic
Scholarship
So, do you want to hear your chances of getting the full-ride schol-
arship? They’re not good. According to the NCAA, high school
boys’ basketball has approximately 500,000 players; 157,000 are

seniors. There are close to 4,500 available freshman positions open
in college ball, leaving an opportunity for just 3 percent of high
school senior basketball players to pick up an NCAA scholarship. If
you’re a swimmer, track-and-field athlete, tennis player, or gymnast
(just to name a few possibilities), your chances of getting that all-
gloried full ride are even more difficult.
None of this, of course, is meant to discourage you. Quite the
opposite. We believe that when you know what you’re up against,
you’ll work that much harder, fight that much longer, and research
that much more to make your dreams come true.
The reality is this: Even the very best of players can be passed
over or overlooked. If this happens to you, it doesn’t mean you
can’t play without a scholarship. Perhaps the most important
question you need to ask yourself is: How much do I want to play?
Surprisingly, some athletes have walked away from an opportunity
to play because it wasn’t under the bright lights of a Division I
school. We would argue that they didn’t really want to play the
sport — they wanted to play at a Division I school.
There are two kinds of prospects: players and athletes. The lion-
hearted athlete will play on with or without a scholarship. And he
will be rewarded tenfold.
In the following sections, we let you know the realities of playing
without a scholarship.
Understanding the benefits
NCAA Division III and the NJCAA Division III schools are excellent
avenues to play sports at the college level while earning a college
education. Beyond the educational experience (which we hope is
a top priority for you), these divisions can provide you with great
exposure to other coaches.
College coaches are always looking for an athlete who can fit well
within their roster but also help the program succeed. One suc-
cessful season with a Division III school may allow you to transfer
(with or without a scholarship offer) to a larger school, if this is
your goal. By using your natural talents and by showing grit, deter-
mination, enthusiasm, and a willingness to take one for the team,
you may garner more attention from other coaches within a
Division III school than you did at the high school level.
In addition, many student-athletes commit to a larger school,
paying their own expenses and testing their own abilities for the
Part II: Getting Recruited 
126

sake of having the full student-athlete experience. Many of these
dedicated athletes simply wanted to take their competition to the
next level. They’re fulfilling a dream while earning a degree. If you
go this route, you’ll have first choice of classes, preferred housing,
the experience of traveling and training with the team, and more.
At the University of Washington, for example, a high percentage
of the athletes are competing without a scholarship because of
the school’s high academic standing. In 1999, four of the state’s
strongest runners were walk-ons at UW, two of the athletes running
a mile under 4:20. As many as 30 of the team’s football players
were also walk-ons. For these athletes, the benefits began to come
as soon as they donned their first Huskies uniform. Hearing the
cheers from the crowd, having the opportunity to travel, and con-
tinuing to play made all the other sacrifices well worth their time.
Taking that first step
Perhaps the first step in playing without a scholarship is accepting
the idea that playing as a nonscholarship athlete is an honor and
does have many benefits. Sports history is filled with Olympic, pro-
fessional, and world-record-setting athletes who began their afflu-
ent careers as nonscholarship athletes.
There are even more stories of athletes who, for one reason or
another, gave up a scholarship to play at a different college with-
out a scholarship. Take, for example, Dylan Leal. The basketball
standout was offered an athletic scholarship to a number of
schools, such as Holy Cross and Lehigh College. But Leal wanted to
stay close to his two brothers in Texas and, as a result, chose to
play at Texas A&M without a scholarship. Coaches said his dedica-
tion and determination to play were so great that he played as a
freshman, and in his senior year, his own teammates named him
captain of the team. Because Leal lived, trained, ate, and played
with the team, most of the team members were unaware of the fact
that he hadn’t been offered an athletic scholarship, dispelling the
myth that the nonscholarship athlete is ostracized or made to feel
like an outsider.
Deciding where
As the story of Dylan Leal illustrates, knowing where you want to
be is important. Maybe you’ve decided you don’t have to wait for
the offer of an athletic scholarship, or you recognize you may not
be offered one at all. Believe it or not, this could be good news: You
now have the freedom to decide where you really want to go to
school.
Chapter 8: What to Do If You Don’t Get Noticed 127

Whether you want to be close to family, remain in a small-town 
setting, or go big — attending large schools and taking in the big-
campus lifestyle — you have a great number of schools to choose
among. Wherever the geographic location, research the school
to be sure it offers your sport and to find out how receptive the
school is to nonscholarship and walk-on athletes.
Survivor: Getting noticed
The motto of the reality-based television show Survivor is “Outwit,
Outlast, Outplay.” Many recruiters have their own motto: “Outwork,
Outmaneuver, Outrecruit.” Many recruiters love the entire process
of finding talent, tracking them down, and wooing them. They love
the rush of beating deadlines and beating out other schools.
Other recruiters hate it. They dread the entire process, under-
standing all the while that it must be done for the good of the 
program. But for this reason, they’re often less agreeable, less
accessible, and less interested in taking on any more talent than
they have to. So, when a walk-on hopeful comes along, these
coaches groan audibly. It isn’t personal, but you — the walk-on —
are representative of more time, more paperwork, and just one
more person to talk to.
You can save yourself a lot of time and heartache by researching a
particular program and coach. Call ahead of time, letting the head
coach know you’re interested in walking on. If the coach is recep-
tive and wants to learn more about you, you may earn an informal
invitation to practice with the team. This walk-on status allows you
and other nonscholarship athletes to participate in a two-day prac-
tice with the team prior to the new school year.
You can’t just appear at a scheduled practice with the hope of play-
ing. You have to tell the coaching staff who you are and what your
intentions are before you ever set foot on their field, court, or track.
The NCAA rules state that only 105 players may be invited to pre-
season football practices prior to the start of classes. As many as
85 of those players are athletes with a scholarship, leaving just 20
positions available. The 20 remaining positions may include the
nonscholarship athletes who are already on the roster, which
makes for very few positions available for incoming freshman.
Understanding the expectations
When you believe you have the opportunity to show your stuff,
you must understand that this opportunity — and indeed, it is an
opportunity — is not free. As a walk-on, you pay your own way.
The positions available may be greatly limited, and the competi-
tion will be fierce.
Part II: Getting Recruited 
128

As a member of the team, scholarship or nonscholarship, you need
to adhere to the rules and guidelines of the NCAA, NJCAA, or NAIA.
Behave and perform as a college athlete.
Walking On
One of the most beloved sports movies of all time is Rudy, the
story of the kid with heart who wanted to play at Notre Dame.
Rudy Ruettiger wasn’t particularly athletic and didn’t have a great
academic record or a big, strong, athletic build. In fact, he was half
the size of the other players. But he had drive and determination.
He was willing to — and did — work harder than anyone on the
field. The story of Rudy is so popular because it is representative
of the notion that if you want something badly enough and are will-
ing to work for it, dreams can come true — no matter the odds.
Not every walk-on story is like the story of Rudy Ruettiger. In fact,
some colleges make the walk-on experience downright easy. Take,
for example, Stanford University, which actually ran an article in
the college paper recruiting possible athletes for the school’s
rowing teams: “We are looking for individuals who enjoy being ath-
letes and who want to commit to being part of a Division I team. . . .
No prior rowing experience is required.”
Chapter 8: What to Do If You Don’t Get Noticed 129
Walking on, walking tall
Even during the walk-on stage, your past can be a big part of the process. Your atti-
tude and work ethic as a high school athlete, your grades, your relationship with
coaches and teammates, and your performance in sports camps can give you a leg
up on the competition.
Former soccer player Jonathan Funston had hopes of attending NCAA Division I
institution Purdue University as a football kicker. He had been offered a scholarship
at a smaller school but really wanted to play at Purdue. Purdue, however, had
already signed a kicker, Jonathan Phillips. But when Phillips changed his mind,
Funston’s past came back to help him.
Phillips decided to go with his home state and kick for the Florida Gators, leaving an
opening on the Purdue roster.
Funston had attended an elite kicking camp in Miami, Florida, ranking third among
many kickers who had already signed with various schools. Because of his per-
formance at this camp, his constant contact with the Purdue coaching staff, and
the partial academic scholarship he had been offered by Purdue, Funston was a
natural fit for the Purdue Boilermakers.

In the following sections, we let you know what you may expect as
a walk-on. Some athletes have reported being more nervous trying
out as a walk-on than having to stand up for an oral presentation
in class. Don’t worry — you don’t have to go through that kind of
stress. If you have your affairs in order, shoelaces tied, and game
face on, the walk-on process should be a walk in the park — or
your game-winning point.
In the following sections, we show you what you need to do in terms
of paperwork and medical information, and how to move forward as
a walk-on athlete.
Prep work
You’ve contacted the coaching staff, and now you’re ready to prac-
tice with the team. Not so fast. Before you lace up, you need to
take care of a few things:
 Medical-history documentation: The athletic department will
provide a form for you to fill out.
 Physical examination: This is pretty straightforward; you just
have to have a physical. You may want to ask in advance how
to get your physical; some colleges require their own team
doctor to give the physical, while other schools expect you to
already have your physical in hand.
 Complete blood work: The lab report must be included with
the physical paperwork, or you may not be allowed to work
out with the team.
 Electrocardiogram (EKG): The EKG report must be included
with the physical paperwork, or you may not be allowed to
work out with the team.
 Record of shots: This should include a tetanus shot and a
thorough record of all your childhood vaccinations.
 Drug testing: Be prepared to give a blood and/or urine sample.
 Previous surgeries/injuries: Any recent injury or surgery pro-
cedure that may interfere with the rigors of training with the
team must be documented and attached with all physical
paperwork.
 Insurance: All nonscholarship and walk-on athletes must have
proof of insurance. You won’t be allowed to participate on the
field or court or in the gym without current medical insur-
ance. Nonscholarship and noninvited walk-ons should expect
to pay for all physical and medical exams (your insurance
may cover this).
Part II: Getting Recruited 
130

The tryout
Most schools have a slated period of time to watch and evaluate
walk-on athletes. After a period of time — dependent upon the indi-
vidual coaching staffs — they will let you know whom they choose
to keep on as walk-ons.
Tryouts are your time to shine. During this time, you’ll be required
to practice with the team, execute plays, and show the coaching
staff that you can work with the team and remember specific drills.
You aren’t an official member of the team — yet. For the most part,
you’ll be used as a practice player. In football, for example, Texas
Tech may be scheduled to play Missouri State. In the weeks prior
to that game, coaches use the walk-ons to act as the Missouri
offense, allowing the starting defense to run plays.
The coaches may take notice of your ability to retain information,
learn plays, and be a viable member of the team. And you may be
allowed to join officially.
Make each practice your best. Don’t expect anything.
The promise: Talk of 
a future scholarship
Andy Carroll walked on at the University of Washington and proved
himself to be a vital member of the team, playing as a running back,
wide receiver, and member of special teams. According to Carroll, he
was told that he was being considered for a scholarship. Through a
series of rules changes, however, schools are now limited to 85
scholarships for 1-A football. Prior to 1977, there were no limitations
on the number of football scholarships a Division 1-A school could
offer, but with the new rules, Carroll had no chance. On May 19,
2004, Carroll filed a class-action lawsuit against the NCAA in U.S.
District Court in Seattle, contending that major football teams vio-
late antitrust laws by refusing to give athletic scholarships to all
walk-on players. Although walk-ons are compensated for at least
their tuition costs, Carroll maintained that he had been promised
more and certainly earned more.
Walk-ons do not receive any form of scholarship, so to say they are
compensated for their tuition is not accurate. They do receive
equipment, apparel, and travel expenses for away games, but that
is usually it.
Chapter 8: What to Do If You Don’t Get Noticed 131

This is but just one story of promises made of scholarships that
never came to fruition. Whether a coach knows if a scholarship is
actually available is hard to know, but student-athletes and their
families are left feeing frustrated and used.
A scholarship is not a scholarship until you and your coach have
signed a financial-aid agreement. We don’t care how hearty the
handshake, how great the promise, how fabulous your perform-
ance on the field — it is not official until it’s a signed agreement.
Until that time, have fun and continue to play for the very reason
you walked on in the first place: to fulfill a dream. But do not bank
on a scholarship and everything it has to offer until the actual
agreement has been presented and signed.
Using the Recruiting Service
In the literary world, a writer should never have to pay for agent
representation. In the modeling world, would-be models have to
pay only for their head shots, not the agent representation. And in
the sports world, a good recruiting service shouldn’t have a price
tag attached to it.
The entire process of college recruiting and collegiate sports is a
business. And businesses require and generate money. So, although
we hope you don’t have to spend money in the recruiting process,
you may decide that having someone else take care of the smaller,
more-tedious expenses — such as postage, envelopes, faxes, and
business cards — is worth your money.
In the following sections, we let you know why a recruiting service
may be right for you, what services they offer, and how to choose
the best one.
What a recruiting service 
can do for you
One of the biggest problems in facing recruiting deadlines lies with
the high school coach. Although they’re well intentioned, many
high school coaches are simply too busy to help individual ath-
letes through the recruiting process. That’s where recruiting serv-
ices come in. A good recruiting service can
 Help you write an athletic résumé
 Help you write an academic résumé
Part II: Getting Recruited 
132

 Explain the recruiting timeline, including what to do when
you’re a freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior in high
school
 Show you sample profiles, allowing you to see what college
coaches are looking for
 Give you links to college Web sites
 Give you links to government agencies, including information
on financial aid, scholarships for minorities, and Title IX
 Give you links to the NCAA, NJCAA, and NAIA
 Provide you with updates on rules of eligibility and recruiting
rules
 Provide important information on SAT and ACT testing
 Share success stories about other student-athletes as they are
recruited and signed by Division I, II, and III schools
 Offer help to parents, providing inside information from par-
ents and student-athletes who have been there before.
This is a great time to ask yourself how busy you really are. Many
families budget time — an hour a day — to send out faxes and bio
sheets and to collect names and addresses so that they can do
their own recruiting. But if your family’s time is too limited, a
recruiting service may offer the perfect solution.
Before signing on the dotted line, find out what you’re paying for.
Find out about what each recruiting service offers. For example,
you should not pay $1,000 for a service of sending out faxes.
Chapter 8: What to Do If You Don’t Get Noticed 133
Beware of the guarantee
If a recruiting service guarantees a scholarship, walk away. Not even college
recruiters can always promise — much less guarantee — a scholarship. Securing
a scholarship involves all kinds of variables. Don’t trust any agency that promises
to land you a scholarship for a dollar fee.
Some services charge up to $3,000 for their guidance in the murky world of schol-
arships and college recruiting. And you figure if they’re asking that much, they must
be good, right? Wrong.
Being on a mailing list or becoming a client of a recruiting service only means that
your name is being looked at (or sent out). Until a college coach actively calls you
or comes to visit you, you are not being recruited.

Researching their records
If you’re thinking about signing up with a particular recruiting
agency, be sure to ask for the names and contact information of
previous clients. Then be sure to follow through and ask those
clients what their experience with the recruiting service was like.
How will you know how good the service is if you don’t speak to
those who have used it before you?
Here’s a list of questions to ask former clients:
 What did the service do for you that you couldn’t have done
yourself?
 Was the service personable? Many student-athletes feel like
they’re simply a number and nothing more. If you’re paying
for a service, you need to know that someone will talk to you
directly, answer your questions, and make you feel like you’re
an important client.
 How much money did you spend? Shopping around and
comparing services is always a good idea.
 Was it money well spent?
 Did the recruiting service follow through with what it 
promised?
 What was your best experience with the recruiting service?
 What was your worst experience?
 Did you end up doing some of the work yourself? Many
overeager parents and student-athletes sign on with a recruit-
ing service, only to do much or most of the recruiting them-
selves. People usually don’t realize how many contacts they
actually had through club or select sports, coaches, or names
they found through their own research. In the end, some fami-
lies say they could have — and should have — done their own
recruiting.
Many recruiting agencies simply offer to place your name and per-
sonal profile on their Web site, which they market to college
recruiters around the nation. They can and will show you docu-
mentation of who they send profiles to, and they post letters of
recommendations from happy clients. But the reality is, most col-
lege coaches do not browse the Internet looking for talent — they
don’t have the time.
Part II: Getting Recruited 
134

Don’t use a recruiting service that only puts your name and profile
on its letterhead when writing to a coach. Your letters, information
packets, and profile should always look as though they came from
you. As impersonal as the entire process seems, coaches want to
feel as though you’re intimately interested in their program.
What questions to ask
As you begin to meet more college recruiters, take the time to ask
them their thoughts on individual recruiting services. Not surpris-
ingly, each recruiter will have his own opinion about recruiting
services, but with carefully placed questions, you can find out how
recruiting services may (or may not) help you.
Be sure to ask recruiters:
 What is the most helpful information you get from recruit-
ing services?
 How often do you look at the Web site of a recruiting serv-
ice or look at the information it sends you?
 How important is a recruiting service in helping you find an
athlete you’re looking for?
 What are the five most important services a recruiting serv-
ice offers a student-athlete?
 What are the five most important services a recruiting serv-
ice can offer a college recruiter?
 What is the single greatest asset a recruiting service offers?
 What are the least important services offered?
 Do you pay more or less attention to an athlete who is rep-
resented by a recruiting service? Does it matter whether the
student-athlete has representation?
Chapter 8: What to Do If You Don’t Get Noticed 135
What do college recruiters say
about recruiting services?
Bigger-name schools with bigger budgets typically don’t use recruiting services.
Simply put, they don’t need to. But smaller schools with smaller budgets may turn
to recruiting services as a matter of convenience. They want to offer scholarships
to gifted athletes but simply don’t have the resources to visit high schools and
actively recruit. For these schools, recruiting services offer a nice alternative to
traveling to find talent.

Show them the money!
After you’ve decided to go with a recruiting service, you may
expect someone to call you or your family to set up an appoint-
ment to talk about the service. By now, you should have searched
the Web, talked to previous clients, and determined that you need
the help of a recruiting service because you don’t have the time.
The recruiter will sit down and explain how the recruiting service
works and what it expects from you. Typically, 50 percent of people
sign during that first appointment. But we recommend taking a few
more days to discuss the fees of the recruiting service, reevaluate
your schedule, and fully understand what the recruiting service is
offering before signing.
What not to do
Recruiting services are gaining popularity as people’s lives become
more and more complicated, but there are a few potential pitfalls
you need to be aware of:
 Don’t offer something in exchange for the services of a
recruiting service. For example, don’t agree to promote the
service or to arrange meetings between recruiters and
coaches in exchange for a recruiting service. The arrangement
should be purely business. You are being offered a service,
and you pay for it.
 Don’t agree to give part of your scholarship money as a way
to pay the recruiting-service fee. This activity is illegal and
Part II: Getting Recruited 
136
The biggest mistake athletes make
Lay it on a little thick. Sweeten the pot. It’s just to get in the front door, right?
Making yourself sound better on paper than you are in person is not a practice
we recommend and certainly not something a reputable recruiting service will 
condone.
A reputable recruiting service is not going to put its reputation on the line by exag-
gerating your abilities and successes. A good recruiting service relies on having
and keeping solid relationships with schools and coaches. Credible recruiting serv-
ices must operate on that basis alone: credibility.
No matter how tempted you are to pad your athletic résumé, don’t do it.

could get you in big trouble. If you can’t afford the service,
this may indicate that you need to do the work yourself. Any
service that asks to take a portion of your scholarship must
be reported to the NCAA, NJCAA, and NAIA.
 Don’t believe endorsements from college coaches. Because
recruiting services rely upon the good word of happy clients
to appeal to potential new customers, they often try to have
college coaches put in a good word as well. Some recruiting
services may have quotes by college coaches endorsing their
particular service. Beware: The NCAA does not allow coaches
to endorse such services. Be wary of recruiting services that
boast personal endorsements by coaches.

Recruiting Violations

 Understanding infractions

 Defining the boosters: Who they are and what they do
W
hen we’re talking infractions, we’re not talking about the
newest mathematics. No, this chapter is about athletics
infractions — everything you know need to know about recruiting
violations and how to stay out of trouble.
Throughout the history of the NCAA, NJCAA, and NAIA, there have
been many heartbreaking stories of student-athletes who unwit-
tingly violated a rule that led to severe penalties and career-ending
consequences. Here, the expression “Knowledge is power” certainly
applies. This chapter gives you the knowledge — and power — you
need to stay out of trouble.
Defining Infractions
An infraction, in basic terms, is a violation of a rule or rules. The
problem from the student-athlete’s perspective is that there are
many rules associated with recruiting for college sports. Any mis-
take in this area could become an infraction. In some cases, the line
is obvious — but in others, it may be pretty subtle.
Everyone knows that if you break a rule, you’ll likely have to face
some penalty. In the context of a recruiting infraction, the penalty
may be probation.

The word probation strikes fear in the heart of every college admin-
istrator, coach, student-athlete, alumnus, booster, and fan of colle-
giate sports. A university or college that is placed on probation can
lose thousands (sometimes millions) of dollars, and it gains a stigma
that may last much longer than a financial penalty.
Since January 2005, probation has been applied against NCAA
Division I institutions in response to 57 infractions. This does not
mean 57 different schools — some schools are on the list more
than once. Looking at the issue more broadly, since January 1990,
164 separate Division I schools have been placed on probation!
The reasons for these probations range from recruiting violations
by a coach to boosters providing currently enrolled student-ath-
letes extra benefits.
One of the most publicized recent cases occurred at the University
of Alabama. A booster allegedly paid approximately $150,000 to a
high school athlete to induce him to sign to play football at the 
university. Moreover, the student-athlete’s high school coach was
also involved in the scandal, and he received about $90,000 of the
inducement, leaving the athlete’s family $60,000. The booster was
eventually sentenced to six months in jail for his involvement. The
high school coach pleaded guilty and testified against the booster
to avoid jail time. Not surprisingly, the high school coach claimed
that at least seven other Division I programs offered him cash
and/or jobs to attempt to get him to persuade the prospect to sign
with their schools.
In this case, the student-athlete was aware of some dirty dealings.
But there have been instances when the student-athlete and his
family took the word of a coach, believing everything to be legal. If
the coach okayed it, that was good enough.
The questions you should ask yourself are: Could this happen to
me? How can I find out if a school has had recruiting violations in
the past? In the following sections, we give you the answers you
need.
Major versus secondary infractions
Truthfully, making a mistake is easy. The 2005–2006 NCAA Division
I Manual is 494 pages long. With that many rules and regulations,
violations are bound to occur. Coaches, administrators, student-
athletes, and boosters are all human, and some will make mistakes.
As a case in point, until 1995, it was technically against NCAA rules
for a student-athlete to receive a ride back to his dorm or apart-
ment from a coach after practice, even if it was 15 degrees and
Part II: Getting Recruited 
140

snowing! How many times do you think that rule was inadvertently
(and most times justifiably) broken? Clearly, a violation like that
is a heck of a lot less egregious than the $150,000 University of
Alabama case we describe earlier. Yet minor and even egregious
violations occur on a regular basis, and student-athletes and their
coaches may pay.
Fortunately, there is recognition at the NCAA that not all infractions
are alike. The main difference between a secondary infraction and a
major infraction is one of intent. According to the NCAA Web site, “A
secondary infraction is one that is isolated or inadvertent in nature,
provides or is intended to provide only a minimal recruiting advan-
tage, and does not include any significant recruiting inducement or
extra benefit.” In reality, while the major infractions grab all the
headlines, the NCAA processes far more secondary violations. For
example, during the five-and-a-half-year span discussed earlier, 8,220
secondary violations have been reported to the NCAA by Division I
institutions. Although there are three leading categories of second-
ary violations, the biggest problem is in the area of recruiting.
Most secondary cases are self-reported (either by the institution or
through a conference office). Secondary infractions generally result
in minor penalties, and sometimes no penalty is assessed at all.
Anything that is not deemed a secondary violation is considered
a major infraction, and these infractions are the ones that bring
severe penalties for the college in question.
The “mother of all infractions” for any school is to be penalized for
“lack of institutional control.” The concept of institutional control
is so important that the NCAA has created a document to define
major infractions further for the college sport directors and admin-
istrative staff. If you’re interested, you can find a summary of it by
going to www.ncaa.org/databases/regional_seminars/
guide_rules_compliance/other_topics/oth_01.html.
The most common infractions
Since January 2000, there have been 3,894 secondary violations in
Division I that pertain to recruiting. That number is almost triple the
number of violations reported regarding eligibility and extra benefits
(the other two of the big three). In addition, 41 major infraction
cases during that time period have been recruiting-related.
You may wonder, “Why there are so many more recruiting viola-
tions, and what are some examples?” Here are a few reasons:
Chapter 9: Recognizing College Recruiting Violations 141

 The recruiting rules are very complex, and there are many
of them. The recruiting section of the Division I Manual is 47
pages long, and there are hundreds, maybe thousands, of
interpretations regarding these rules.
 The rules are constantly changing. The membership has the
ability to amend its rules annually (and sometimes even more
often than that!). Imagine how frustrating it would be to play a
sport in which the rules changed each year.
 Coaches are competitive by nature and will push the enve-
lope as much as they can to gain a recruiting advantage
over other schools. This is the main reason why there are so
many recruiting violations.
Many of the recruiting violations are inadvertent and can be as
simple as the head coach’s calling a prospect on Monday and an
assistant coach’s calling on Wednesday without realizing that the
head coach had used the one call per week.
Another common recruiting violation occurs when prospects make
unofficial visits to campuses during designated dead periods and
coaches meet with them. These visits are considered to be contact
during a period when contact isn’t permissible (even on the school’s
campus).
A dead period is a period of time when it isn’t permissible for
coaches to make recruiting contacts or evaluations on or off the
college campus. Coaches can write and call prospects during this
time, but any face-to-face contact is against the rules.
Paying the penalties
The Mustangs of Southern Methodist University were on the rise in
the world of college football in the early 1980s. In 1980, the school
received its first-ever ranking at #20. The next season, the Mustangs
went 10-1 and won their first conference title since 1965. It only got
better for the Mustangs when they finished #2 in the final polls in
1982. By all accounts, SMU was becoming a force in the world of
football.
It all came crashing down when, in 1987, the NCAA handed down
the first and only “death penalty” sanction to any sports program,
forcing SMU to cancel the entire season and limiting it to a seven-
game season in 1988. Only in 1989 was the school allowed to
resume a full competitive season.
The reasons for these severe penalties are many, but here are a few
of the highlights:
Part II: Getting Recruited 
142

 Twenty-one football players allegedly received roughly
$61,000 in cash payments.
 Boosters and members of the athletic department were
involved in the payments.
 Payments ranged from $50 to $725 per month.
Because of these violations, the NCAA made an example of SMU,
not only restricting their 1987 and 1988 competitive seasons but
also placing a two-year ban on any bowl games. The NCAA also
restricted the number of coaches the team was allowed to have
(three fewer coaches than other schools were permitted). Finally,
the college lost 55 scholarships over a four-year period.
How has all this impacted the football program with the Mustangs?
Since the death penalty, the football team has posted one winning
season, when it went 6-5 in 1997. In fact, the victory bell has rung a
total of only ten times in the last four years.
The long-term impact of this ruling has forced the NCAA to do
everything in its power not to hand down the death penalty again.
Giving the SMU football program the death penalty has been com-
pared to the United States dropping the atom bomb in World War
II. The results and aftermath were so catastrophic that the commit-
tee on infractions will do everything in its power to avoid handing
down the death penalty to another program.
In your everyday, run-of-the-mill violations, the penalties are not
nearly so severe and are contingent on what the infraction was.
For example, if a school exceeds the number of permissible games
it is allowed to play in one year, the standard NCAA penalty is to
reduce the number of contests the school may play the following
year, using a two-for-one formula. In Division I soccer, a school is
permitted to play a maximum of 20 games (not including confer-
ence or NCAA tournament games) during the fall season. So if a
school inadvertently played 21 games in 2005, it would be limited
to 18 games in 2006 using the two-for-one formula.
The bottom line: A school invariably pays the penalty for commit-
ting a violation. The severity of the penalty is determined by many
factors but can range from losing a scholarship to not being able to
recruit a prospect for a short period of time.
In the end, the moral of this story is clear. It’s everything your
mother ever taught you growing up: Play nice and obey the rules —
or you’re gonna get it!
Chapter 9: Recognizing College Recruiting Violations 143

Playing (or Not) with
an Infraction
Indeed, infractions can be confusing, if not scary, stuff. You’ve
spent a significant amount of time, energy, and money to gather
information, talk to college recruiters and athletes, review records,
and visit campuses around your state or the nation. Then, in one
instant, a mistake could ruin everything. And the mistake may not
be yours. But by knowing the rules and understanding the impor-
tance of self-reporting and a coach’s boundaries, you can save
yourself and your family a lot of heartache.
Part II: Getting Recruited 
144
Knowing the history
Why care about infractions? Because they could impact you directly. If a school
has had a history of major infractions, it may be required to reduce the number of
scholarships it can offer in the next few years or be banned from participating in
postseason play (either conference or NCAA tournaments).
Take the case of Mississippi State as an example. In the summer of 2004, the
school’s football program was placed on four years’ probation. The probation
included a ban on postseason play (no conference championship or bowl game if
the team qualified for one or both) and limited the program to 81 scholarships for
both the 2005–2006 and 2006–2007 academic years (which is four fewer than the
maximum 85 scholarships permitted).
Imagine that the school had been recruiting you to play football there beginning in
2005–2006. There may be a chance that the scholarship you were offered now no
longer exists, due to the limitations placed on the program.
Although this is a very rare case, it happens. The possibility of not having a schol-
arship available may cause you concern and encourage you to start looking more
closely at other schools that may be recruiting you. Even though the postseason
ban was for only one year, such restrictions can make it even more difficult to qual-
ify for postseason play for the next few years.
So we ask again: Why care? Because infractions may directly impact your chance
to play.
Remember: You have the right to know if a school has reported violations on its own
or had the NCAA impose sanctions on it in recent years that might affect where,
when, and how you play. The NCAA Web site has a listing of every school that has
had a major-infractions case since 1953. You can go to www.ncaa.org and click
Major Infractions to find out more.

When the coach violates
recruiting rules
The NCAA imposes penalties for recruiting violations. Usually the
penalties are levied on the coach or the institution, but occasion-
ally they can impact the student-athlete’s eligibility at that school.
Case in point: Let’s say a college coach is attending a golf tourna-
ment organized by your high school, and about an hour before you
start your round, he visits with you and wishes you good luck.
Because coaches aren’t allowed to have in-person contact with
prospects prior to competition, this is a violation.
Normally, when a violation such as this is reported to the NCAA,
the college must declare the prospect ineligible to play there. At
the same time, the school will request to have eligibility restored.
Ninety-five percent of the time, the prospect’s eligibility is restored
at that school, but sometimes the prospect will not be eligible to
compete at that school and will have to scratch it off his list. This
situation may warrant special consideration to determine whether
the violation was intentional or an innocent mistake.
If the violation does not involve the eligibility of a prospect, the
general rule of thumb is the penalty will be “two for one.” What
that means is if a coach accidentally calls you twice in one week,
the automatic penalty will be that the coach will not be permitted
to call for the next two weeks.
When the college makes a mistake
Mistakes happen — and most mistakes are not deliberate but
merely an oversight or a bad judgment call. A perfect example of
this may be demonstrated by none other than co-author Pat Britz.
While working as the assistant athletic director for compliance at
East Tennessee State, Britz once told the women’s basketball coach
that she could go out and begin recruiting days before it was actu-
ally permitted.
To this day, Pat has no idea where he got the idea that she might
go out early. Perhaps he was distracted or was looking at the
wrong date on the calendar. But for whatever reason, she either
trusted her assistant athletic director completely or didn’t discuss
her schedule with her colleagues. Off she went, making a home
visit to a prospect. Another school, which was also recruiting the
girl, learned that a coach from East Tennessee State had already
been to see her.
Chapter 9: Recognizing College Recruiting Violations 145

The school called East Tennessee State and asked how this was
possible. That’s how they found out about the screw-up. Pat’s
coach was great about it and took it in stride, but he felt horrible.
East Tennessee State reported it to the NCAA, and during the next
contact period, they had to wait three days before their coaches
could go out.
While Britz and East Tennessee State worked to restore the stu-
dent-athlete’s eligibility, the athlete wound up going to another
school altogether. The best part about the whole story was how
surprised and excited Pat’s coach was that she was the first one to
visit the girl in her home. The coach really had no idea she was vio-
lating any rules, and the family had no reason to suspect a problem
because they were unaware of the rules.
Discovering the Wonders (and
Horrors) of Boosters
If you’re a sports fan, you’ve heard the term booster associated
with various sports programs. Typically, boosters raise funds or
donate sports apparel or equipment to an athletic program. If
you’re an athlete, you may be familiar with the term as it pertains
to car washes, cookie sales, and making T-shirts.
But what is a booster, really? What does a booster do? And how
can a booster be a problem for a sports program or an individual
athlete? Just as well-meaning coaches, athletic directors, and par-
ents can violate NCAA rulings, overzealous boosters can be a real
headache for athletic programs.
Defining the booster
A booster is a person who makes a financial contribution to that
particular program. According to the NCAA, however, a booster (or
“representative of athletics interests,” in NCAA language) is some-
one who has done at least one of the following activities:
 Participated in or been a member of an agency or organization
promoting the institution’s intercollegiate athletics program
 Made financial contributions to the athletics department or to
an athletics-booster organization of that institution
 Assisted or been requested (by the athletic department staff)
to assist in the recruitment of prospects
Part II: Getting Recruited 
146

 Assisted or been asked to assist in providing benefits to
enrolled student-athletes or their families
 Been otherwise involved in promoting the institution’s athlet-
ics program
As you can see, there are several ways an individual can earn the
label booster in the eyes of the NCAA. Some people have argued
that simply purchasing season tickets for a college team can make
someone a booster.
Another interesting fact about being a booster is that, after you
become one, you’re considered one indefinitely. Why? The main
reason is to prevent an individual from moving back and forth from
not being a booster to being a booster so that he can be involved in
activities not otherwise permitted by the NCAA, such as recruiting.
How boosters are involved 
in the recruiting process
As we mention at the beginning of this chapter, involvement in the
recruiting process by boosters can become a major headache for
schools and the NCAA. For that reason, the NCAA has attempted to
eliminate boosters from the entire recruiting process. This includes
not permitting a booster to have in-person contact with, or even
written or phone communication with, a prospect. In fact, one by-
law in the NCAA Manual is specifically devoted to listing the restric-
tions against a booster’s being involved in the recruiting process,
while several other by-laws refer to it.
An interesting scenario that occasionally crops up, however, is when
a booster is a neighbor of yours or a close family friend. Does this
mean your neighbor can’t speak to you because he’s a booster?
Fortunately, there is a provision that contains the term pre-existing
relationship, which takes into account situations like this. The situa-
tion can get sticky, however, if the booster starts providing you
and/or your family with benefits that are more extravagant than
those you received prior to becoming a high school athlete.
For example, while you were growing up, your neighbor was always
pleasant to you and supported your athletic pursuits as a fan and
friend, but no gifts or favors were ever exchanged. After your sopho-
more year in high school, however, you’ve been named All-State in
your sport, and the school from which your neighbor graduated has
started recruiting you. All of a sudden, your neighbor starts asking
you to attend games with him at his expense and gives you a sweat-
shirt with the school’s logo on it. Because activities like this didn’t
Chapter 9: Recognizing College Recruiting Violations 147

occur prior to your becoming a prospect, the NCAA would not con-
sider this okay under the pre-existing relationship exception.
What matters is that your relationship with a booster not change
based on your athletic performance.
The role of a booster can be powerful, but the role of family should
be even more so. A few years ago, one of the hottest names in col-
lege football was being recruited by colleges such as Penn State,
Notre Dame, Ohio State, Michigan State, and Texas, to name a few.
A booster of one of the colleges also happened to act as a surro-
gate father to this hot new prospect. Understandably, the athlete’s
single mother turned to the booster for help. What was the best
school for her son? Which school offered the best athletic program
and the best education?
It came as a huge surprise to many when the young athlete chose
a different school from his surrogate father’s alma mater, but the
father/booster took it well, telling friends and family that he would
respect the student-athlete’s wishes. In truth, it was the booster
who urged his surrogate son to choose a different school. His
devotion to the boy overrode his connections to the school. His
request that his name be withheld from this story is proof of how
committed boosters can be and are to their schools. His concern
was that despite the fact that the young athlete chose the school
that was best for him personally, boosters and fans of the surro-
gate father’s school would not care or understand. For many
people, winning is everything.
Understanding that recruiting is serious business is important.
You must always remember that even the kindest and most sincere
booster, coach, or recruiter can make an innocent, deliberate, cal-
culated, or unwitting violation to get what he wants.
When you hear the chants of “Rah, rah, team!”, remember that you
and your family are the critical team at this time. Make sure you
understand the rules of the game and make sound decisions before
moving forward. You have plenty of time down the road to hear the
cheers of your fans, coaches, boosters, and teammates.

You think you know what college you want to attend. Maybe
you love it because of its team mascot or the school colors or
because you have friends there. Maybe you want to attend a spe-
cific university because it has a winning record.
Whatever your reason, don’t make a final decision until you’ve
checked out the campus and facilities. You wouldn’t buy a car
you’ve never seen, and you don’t want to commit to a school until
you’ve walked the campus, talked to students who attend the
school, read the college paper, and eaten the food. After all, the
school you choose will be your home for the next four years. You
want to be sure the school is a good fit with your wants and needs
as a student-athlete.
This chapter shows you how to make the most of your official and
unofficial campus visits, including knowing what to see, who to talk
to, and whether to work out with the prospective team.
Visiting the Campus
The wonderful thing about campus visits is that you can browse,
peruse, and investigate at your leisure — well, for 48 hours, anyway.
By making both official and unofficial visits to college campuses,

you can get a better feel for college life and social activities, as well
as where you may live, eat, study, and train. In the following sec-
tions, we explain the difference between official visits and unofficial
visits, and fill you in on how you can benefit from both kinds.
Taking official visits
Official visits are prearranged visits you make to a college during
your senior year in high school in which the college may finance
the entire trip or part of it. Official visits are a key component of
the recruiting process, so if you’re asked to make one by a school,
chances are that you’re high on the list of players the college pro-
gram is interested in.
Although you can make official visits only during your senior year,
you can prepare for your official visits earlier. Before you’re a
senior, start making notes on what you want to ask college offi-
cials, and begin thinking about what you’ll take with you. See
“Looking at a Typical Visit,” later in this chapter, for ideas.
According to NCAA rules, an official visit is when you’re invited to
a college to check out the facility, coaching staff, academic environ-
ment, and geographic location at the college’s expense. Most major
Division I programs pay for your entire visit (for example, trans-
portation, lodging, and meals). Some smaller Division I schools,
and most Division II and Division III schools, can pay for only part
of the trip or none of it (depending on how much money they have
available).
Just because you’re on an official visit doesn’t mean the school will
be paying for everything. The school may pay for your transporta-
tion, lodging, and/or meals. But you may receive an official-visit
invitation from a university that can or will pay for only part of
your trip. You’ll be responsible for all other expenses.
Be sure you know what the school is paying for before you accept.
If you can’t afford to pay for the portion of the trip the school won’t
cover, be honest with the recruiter.
If you don’t have the funds for lodging or meals, you can’t hold a
fund-raiser to raise money. Doing so may jeopardize your amateur
status within the NCAA and NAIA guidelines. Your best strategy
if you’re strapped for cash is to be completely honest with the
recruiter. Tell him that you’d love to come, but you simply can’t
afford the added cost of gas, travel, lodging, and food. If the school
really wants you, it may be able to offer you an extra allowance for
those things.
Part III: Making College Visits 
152

Prior to the 2004–2005 academic year, the NCAA passed a new
ruling that seriously affects official visits for athletes. In the past,
schools were allowed to fly prospects on private planes so that, for
example, a football prospect was able to play in a Friday-night high
school game, catch a private airplane to a college early Saturday
morning, and then stay for the duration of the weekend. This prac-
tice was particularly helpful for student-athletes who lived in
remote places or hoped to attend rural colleges with no commer-
cial airport nearby. Under the new rules, you have to take a flight
on a commercial airline — no more private flights on official visits.
Opting for unofficial visits
The NCAA defines unofficial visits as visits you make to a college at
your own expense. That means you pay for everything. Rules do
not limit the number of unofficial visits you can make to a school. If
you want to visit the same school 15 times at your own expense,
feel free.
Another key difference between official and unofficial visits: You
can make an unofficial visit prior to your senior year of high school.
Many prospects begin making unofficial visits as early as their fresh-
man or sophomore year, and some students commit to a school by
their junior year (that is, before even having the opportunity to
make an official visit).
The only expenses a school can pick up for you on an unofficial
visit are three complimentary admissions to any home athletics
contest (these can be used by you and anyone who is with you,
even if they aren’t your parents) and transportation on campus. If,
for some reason, the sport you play has a facility off campus, the
coach can drive you to see that facility as long as it’s within 30
miles of the campus. You must pay for any meals you eat while on
the unofficial visit. You can stay in a campus dorm or apartment
during an unofficial visit as long as you pay the institution rate for
such lodging.
How many visits can you make?
In Divisions I and II, you’re allowed a total of five official visits
between the two divisions. Even though you may be interested in
schools in both divisions, you can make a total of only five official
visits. Although an official visit to a Division III school doesn’t
count in the five-visit limit, you may not make more than one offi-
cial visit to any particular school in Division III.
Chapter 10: The Play-by-Play of College Visits 153

For example, you can make three official visits to Division I schools,
two official visits to Division II schools, and three official visits to a
Division III school so long as you don’t make more than one official
visit to the same school in Division III.
Because you’re allowed only five official visits, you must be selec-
tive about where you go. If you live within driving distance of a col-
lege that interests you, you may be better off making an unofficial
visit to that campus and saving the official visits for more-distant
colleges.
If you’re a multisport athlete, you still get only five official visits
total. For example, if you play baseball and football, you can make
three official visits to schools for baseball and two official visits to
schools for football — but not more than five total.
When can you visit?
Generally speaking, your first opportunity to make an official visit
to any college is the first day of classes of your senior year in high
school.
The summer before your senior year, make a list of the colleges
you want to visit — officially and unofficially. You can create your
own game plan — or traveling schedule — of when and how you’ll
visit these schools.
In all cases, for any sport, before the school can pay for your visit,
it must have a copy of your high school transcript (the official doc-
ument or a copy of it) and a standardized test score (PSAT, SAT,
PLAN, or ACT). Your test score doesn’t have to make you eligible at
that point, but a school may be reluctant to spend the money to
bring you to campus if it’s concerned about whether you’ll be eligi-
ble as a freshman — further proof that grades matter!
If, for some reason, you need to make an official visit after you’ve
finished high school (for example, if you’re transferring or have
delayed enrollment, for whatever reason), you’re permitted five
more visits after October 15 (for Divisions I and III) or September 1
(for Division II). So you could make a total of ten official visits if you
made five in high school and five after graduating. In addition, if you
made an official visit to a college or university while you were in
high school, you could make another visit to the same school as
long as it was after one of the no-earlier-than dates listed.
Another limiting factor regarding official visits is that some
Division I sports have restrictions on the number of visits they
can offer to prospects. They are as follows:
Part III: Making College Visits 
154

 Football: 56
 Basketball: 12
 Baseball: 25
The reason for limiting the number of official visits a college may
offer to prospects is simple: It prevents bigger, better-funded ath-
letic programs from outspending everyone else . . . and getting a
recruiting advantage.
How long can you stay?
Official visits are limited to 48 hours. Fortunately, the 48-hour clock
begins to tick when you arrive on the campus, not when you start
traveling.
If, for some reason, the coach picks you up at your home to travel
by automobile, the 48-hour period begins when the coach begins
transporting you to campus (that is, the moment when she has the
opportunity to begin a recruiting pitch).
Unofficial visits impose no restriction on the length of your stay.
You or your family can stay as long as you feel comfortable paying
lodging, food, and other bills. For economic reasons, however, most
unofficial visits last one or two days.
Who will be with you on 
an official tour?
Coaches, athletic directors, trainers, and professors generally
make themselves available to meet you and to answer a few ques-
tions, but few have time to spend an entire afternoon with you and
your family. Therefore, a student host is assigned to you to show
you around campus and answer questions. A student host is usually
an underclassman on the team (and a potential future teammate).
The student host’s main goal is to make sure that you leave with
a good impression of the school — not to give you a completely
honest assessment.
Who pays for entertainment?
One of the most misunderstood parts of official visits is what type
of entertainment is permitted during that visit. At most Division I
schools, the student host is given $30 a day to entertain you, but
Chapter 10: The Play-by-Play of College Visits 155

the student host can’t give you this money or buy you sweatshirts,
hats, posters, and so on. This money is intended to take you to a
movie, go get a pizza, play miniature golf, or provide whatever
other entertainment floats your boat.
Unfortunately, this entertainment rule has been abused frequently
in the past. But rules were made to be broken, right? Not with the
NCAA. Any violation of NCAA rules, such as accepting gifts or
buying nonregulated items with college funds, could make you inel-
igible at that particular school until the value of that so-called extra
benefit is paid back. If you borrow money from the allotted $30 in
order to buy a college T-shirt, the student host has to show that
the money was borrowed, and you must pay it back. Even so,
you’ve violated the NCAA prohibition on using entertainment
money to buy something for a souvenir. And if you receive a bene-
fit that exceeds $100, you may be permanently ineligible to com-
pete for that school. Be careful, be aware of the rules, and insist
that the host spend money on approved items only.
The good news is that during an official visit, the school pays for
all meals for you and for your parents, legal guardians, and/or
spouse. In addition, the school can provide you and your family
admissions for any home athletics events. For this reason, most
schools try to schedule official visits during a regular season or
playoff home contest of some sort. You’re permitted to receive
three complimentary admissions for any home contests that occur
during the official visit. These complimentary admissions, which
are good for any sport, can be used by you and anyone else who
may be accompanying you on the visit.
Schools may not provide you the three complimentary admissions
to a conference tournament or championship the school is hosting
during an official or unofficial visit. In addition, if the school is
hosting an NCAA championship, you’re on your own for tickets,
even if you’re on an official visit.
For other forms of entertainment (meals, movies, and so on), the
school may pay only for you and your parents (or legal guardians)
or your spouse. For example, if your little brother comes with you
on the visit, and the whole family goes out to eat with the coach, you
or your parents need to pay for the kid’s grilled-cheese sandwich.
A recently adopted NCAA rule requires schools to have on file
all policies related to official visits for prospects, student hosts,
coaches, and administrators. The school must inform you that sex,
drugs, alcohol, and gambling will not be part of the visit. If you
engage in any of these activities during an official visit, you could
Part III: Making College Visits 
156

jeopardize your eligibility at that school. If any of the forbidden
activities occurs while you’re on an official visit, the school has
violated an NCAA rule and must self-report it. You don’t need this
kind of trouble.
Coaches talk to one another, and it does not take long for word to
travel to different colleges about an athlete’s behavior. Read the
school policies; adhere to the rules; and conduct yourself in a
mature, responsible fashion. You’re a guest at the school, and it
pays to behave like one.
Where do you stay?
You and whoever accompanies you will likely stay at a local hotel
during an official visit. Many athletic departments trade out a cer-
tain number of rooms at a hotel in exchange for tickets, advertising
space, and so on. The accommodations you receive must be com-
parable to typical student living. What that means is the school
can’t put you up in a suite that’s three times the size of a dorm
room and has a Jacuzzi and other special qualities. Also, keep in
mind that the school is permitted to pay for lodging only for you
and your parents, legal guardians, or spouse. If other family mem-
bers or friends accompany you on the visit, they need to pay for
their own lodging, or they all have to cram into your room.
If you make phone calls from the room or watch a pay-per-view
movie, you’re responsible for those charges. NCAA rules forbid the
school to pay for incidental charges you may accumulate. Many
schools ask the hotel to disconnect these services in order to pre-
vent any potential problems.
Many coaches prefer that you spend at least one night in a dorm or
apartment with your student host. This is an excellent opportunity
for you to get the feel of what it would be like to be a student-ath-
lete at the school. It also allows you to see what your life would be
like on campus. You may find that you don’t get along with the
members of the current team or simply don’t like the atmosphere
at the school. You’re better off knowing this before you commit to
a college.
Just because you don’t like one school doesn’t mean there isn’t a
school out there that’s right for you. You just need to look around
for the right fit.
Chapter 10: The Play-by-Play of College Visits 157

Deciding Whether Your Parents
Should Make the Trip
Where to attend college may be one of the toughest decisions
you’ll make in your academic and athletic career. This decision will
affect at least the next four or five years of your life — it may have
an impact on your career or who you end up marrying!
The extent to which you want your parents involved is a matter of
personal preference. Keep in mind that your parents may very well
have attended college themselves, and they may have a lot of help-
ful advice to offer.
Wooing your parents
Many coaches recruit parents as actively as they do student-ath-
letes. They understand that attending a particular college is often a
family decision, and they hope to endear themselves to your par-
ents. For this reason, it may be very important for at least one of
your parents to travel with you on official visits.
A major drawback to having your parents go with you, however, is
that the school is not allowed to pay for your parents’ transporta-
tion if you’re flying. If you’re driving, the school may reimburse
your mileage or gas, but the reimbursement must be made out to
you, as the athlete.
Be wary of coaches or a school policy that discourages parents
from participating in an official visit. Although no hard rules
require the presence of parents during official visits, schools
should never discourage your parents from attending, asking ques-
tions, and being part of this important time in your life.
If your high school or club coach drives you to an official visit in
his own personal vehicle, you or your coach are not allowed to be
reimbursed for mileage. You can be reimbursed only if your par-
ents drive you.
Leaving them behind
Some people believe that because you’ll be attending school alone,
you should visit the campus alone — making the first of many
important adult decisions by yourself. This decision is a personal
Part III: Making College Visits 
158

one, but having another perspective on a big decision is very help-
ful. Remember: No one will have your best interests at heart more
than your parents.
If you and your parents do decide that they won’t go with you, they
can still be a vital part of the team effort. Together, you can come
up with a list of questions you plan to ask the coaches, training
staff, current athletes, and professors from your chosen major. You
can also make a list of items you want to check on — the library,
dorm rooms, laundry and training facilities — and your parents can
remind you of things you’ve forgotten (or didn’t even know about).
Leave copies of these notes and questions for your parents so that
each night you’re away, you can call or e-mail them and talk about
them together. You can give your perspective of what you’ve seen
and heard, and your parents can make their own notes based on
what you tell them. This conversation will help you reiterate what
you saw and heard during the day, giving you the opportunity to
reflect on your own impressions.
You can also send digital pictures of the campus, dorm rooms,
training facilities, and more. That way, your parents will get to
“see” the campus along with you and be part of the experience.
Looking at a Typical Visit
A typical official visit will be structured so that you and your family
have an opportunity to check out specific facilities, sporting events,
faculty, and the dorms. Most likely, your official campus tour will be
given by another student. Your guide will be able to answer ques-
tions about college life, academics, and off-campus activities.
If you make an unofficial visit — for which you pay your own
expenses — you may discover more-useful information by touring
the facilities on your own. After all, the student host you’ll have on
an official visit is trying to put a positive spin on everything. You
may be able to get a more-accurate picture by talking to students
who aren’t trying to woo you on behalf of the coach or team.
Whether official or unofficial, the trick is deciding when to go, who
to talk to, and what to ask.
During dead periods (periods of inactivity for recruiters), coaches
are not permitted to talk to you in person. Coaches may not speak
with you on or off campus. They can, however, speak to you by
telephone or correspond in writing.
Chapter 10: The Play-by-Play of College Visits 159

But if you have any hopes of having a face-to-face meeting during
this time, it can’t happen. Therefore, when planning an unofficial
visit, be sure it isn’t during the dead period for that sport.
So strict are these guidelines that coaching-staff members may not
even attend or speak at banquets in which a student-athlete
prospect may be in attendance.
Weekend visits are the most common for families hoping to find
out more about a college — they usually fit in best with work and
school schedules. If at all possible, we recommend making your
visit during the week instead of on the weekend. Weekend, spring-
break, and summer visits don’t give you the complete picture.
Campus life is considerably quieter. Although you may have full
access to athletic facilities and the athletic dorms, you’ll miss out
on the feel of the college campus.
Walking the campus
When you’re walking around the campus, read bulletin boards, get
a copy of the student newspaper, eat in the cafeteria, and talk to
other students. If you’re visiting a campus with your family, split
up for a while, allowing each of you to check out the campus indi-
vidually and take notes. When you get together later and compare
notes, chances are that your parents, guardian, friend, sibling, or
spouse will have a different perspective on the campus than you
did, and you can use the information they found that you didn’t.
If you feel too embarrassed or intimidated to talk to students or
athletes, let your parents help you out. While you’re checking out
the classes, your parents can talk to college students, asking their
opinions on academic, athletic, and social issues.
Here are the questions you should be asking:
 What makes this college campus so special?
 What are the big issues being debated on campus?
 What’s dorm life like?
 How large are the first-year/introductory classes?
 What do students do on the weekends?
 How does the team appear to get along?
 What’s the athletic facility like?
 If you’re a minority: What is the minority population on
campus?
Part III: Making College Visits 
160

 What is the one thing you would change about this college?
 How are student athletes viewed by the general student body,
and, in particular, how are members of the team you’ll be
playing on viewed?
You can check out the Princeton Review’s The Best 361 Colleges:
The Smart Student’s Guide to Colleges to get an idea of what campus
living is like at any college that interests you. This book even
includes such topics as parking accommodations and how stu-
dents rank the food. You can find it at major bookstores or at
www.princetonreview.com/college/.
Sitting in on a class
When you arrange an official visit, you’ll meet with faculty members
who teach the subjects you’re thinking about majoring in, and
choose a few classes to sit in on. If you’re not sure what you’ll major
in, you can meet with faculty who teach some of the courses that all
freshmen are likely to take, like 100-level history or English courses.
Attending class is an important step in visualizing yourself on
campus. While you’re attending a class, you may want to get a copy
of the course syllabus (which outlines all the course requirements
and assignments) to get a better idea of what’s expected of you aca-
demically. You can get a copy of the syllabus from the professor.
If you’re visiting the campus unofficially, you can still discover a
lot about the campus, coaches, students, and classes. With a few
phone calls ahead of time, and perhaps the help of your school
guidance counselor, you can probably arrange to meet with faculty
members and attend a few classes. You can also check out the
dorms and the academic buildings, and see where they are in rela-
tion to the rest of the campus. You can find out about transporta-
tion between where you would live, class buildings, athletic
facilities, the student union, the library, and the health center.
Be sure to visit the campus library, and check to see how many
computers are available to students, what kind of assistance is
offered to new students, the hours of operation, and what kind of
additional resources the staff may offer. If your schedule allows,
check out the library on a Friday night. If there seem to be a lot of
students around, chances are that the school has strong academic
influences — or at least a segment of students who care about 
academics.
Chapter 10: The Play-by-Play of College Visits 161

Touring the athletic facilities
Ah, yes. The reason for your being there — or so some people
think. In reality, athletics is just one piece of the puzzle, albeit an
important piece. During an official visit, you’ll be introduced to the
coaching staff and trainers, and you may even be given a personal
tour by the coach.
For an unofficial visit, make arrangements in advance to meet the
staff and have full access to the sports facilities.
Look at the condition of the equipment and field house itself. What
kind of locker-room and weight-room facilities does the school have?
Passing the physical exam
During an official visit, be prepared for the coaching staff to have
one of the athletic trainers give you a physical examination. This
is a great time to talk to the trainers and discover more about the
facility.
While you’re getting your physical, you can check out the training
room. Ask about the number of trainers per student-athlete and
what kind of medical assistance is provided on campus, as well as
the hours of operation and the availability of coaches and trainers
in case of a medical issue.
What to expect
Before you buy the car, always kick the tires and take it for a spin.
Your school of interest may feel the same way, wanting to check
your medical history again before committing to anything long-
term. Although the school has your transcripts, stats, and other
vital information, the coaching staff always wants reassurances
that you’re as sound in person as you appear on paper.
Here’s what you can expect:
 Medical-history sheet: You’ll be asked to fill out a medical-his-
tory sheet, listing the dates, causes, and treatment of injuries
such as concussions, surgeries, or prolonged illnesses.
 Internal medical check: The trainers may check your blood
pressure, pulse, height, and weight, as well as investigate any
problems that arise from the medical-history sheet, such as
head injuries and/or surgeries.
Part III: Making College Visits 
162

Don’t be surprised if you’re also asked to submit a urine
sample. More and more schools are locking down on sub-
stance abuse, including steroids, Creatine, and other muscle-
building stimulants.
 Orthopedic exam: During this examination, the trainers will
take a more-thorough look at your ankles, knees, shoulders,
hips, and so on. This is their way of kicking your tires to be
sure you don’t have too many miles or any engine troubles
before they buy in.
Play it smart, and bring with you as much information as possible,
including:
 An up-to-date medical history, including current personal
history and vaccinations.
 A well-documented history of your medical injuries: Trainers
will be interested in how you injured your knee, what kind of
surgery you had, and when it happened. More important, you
want to be sure to include the kind of treatment or physical
therapy you went through on your road to recovery. Trainers
want reassurances that you took the injury seriously and were
proactive in your physical therapy for a full recovery.
 Phone numbers, addresses, and complete names of all the
physicians, trainers, therapists, and/or coaches you’ve
worked with.
What to pack
You’ll be meeting your potential training and coaching staff, and
you want to appear prepared and eager to work. Even though you
may not be asked to work out or fill out any medical history, you
need to be ready for such tasks in case they do ask you.
Arrive with a small training bag in hand. Throw in:
 A notebook: Bring a notebook with questions you may have
for the trainers and/or coaching staff. You may become over-
whelmed by everything that’s happening. By bringing a note-
book, you’ll appear organized — and you’ll also get the answers
to the questions you have.
 Running shoes: Pack athletic shoes that you can perform in,
whether it’s a cardio test on the treadmill or simply walking
around the athletic facility.
 Workout clothes: If you’re dressed in street clothes, you can
change quickly and be ready to take any tests thrown your way.
Chapter 10: The Play-by-Play of College Visits 163

 Medications: Pack any medications you may need while work-
ing out, such as your asthma inhaler.
Too many young athletes are hesitant to show their trainers
their inhalers for fear that the trainers may think less of them.
That simply isn’t the case. Some of the greatest athletes in
the world are asthmatics. Trainers want to see what kind of
medication and what dosage you require. They’ll be the ones
handling the inhaler, so you need to have an open, candid dis-
cussion about your condition.
Playing with the team
You may be permitted to play a game of pick-up with the team on
your official visit, so pack your bags wisely. Bring along your cleats,
shorts, mouthpiece, or whatever sports-specific gear you own.
Not everyone gets to show her stuff in front of a coach. If you get
this chance, here are the rules:
 A coach may not arrange or be on hand to observe you
while you’re playing with the team.
 Playing with the team is only to allow you playtime — it
isn’t supposed to be a test of your abilities. While you work
with a trainer, he’ll be assessing your physical conditioning
and medical background. When you play with the team, no
one is testing your abilities, but be warned: You are being
tested. How well you work with others, your mental attitude,
and how you mesh with the team will be noted — you can be
sure of that. Always put your best foot forward, and show
everyone a great mental attitude. Whining for water or declar-
ing that it’s too hot for practice is not a good strategy.
If you’re visiting a Division II school, you can have on-campus
playtime in which you’ll be observed or tested by coaching
staff, under the following conditions:
• The test or observation must take place on the college
campus.
• Only a high school senior who is not in season for his
sport may be observed by a college coach and/or staff.
• The two-year college student who has exhausted his eli-
gibility status may also be tested by a coach/trainer.
• The four-year college student, following the conclusion
of his season, may also test, as long as he has written
permission from his athletic director and coach.
Part III: Making College Visits 
164

 A medical examination may be given as part of the tryout
process. Be sure to have all your medical-history information
with you.
 The tryout or playtime should run no longer than a regu-
larly sanctioned practice with the college. It should be no
longer than two hours.
 The college may provide the gear you need for a competi-
tion or tryout, but be prepared, and bring your own gear.
 In the sport of football, you aren’t permitted to wear a
helmet or pads during this playtime.
Looking at dorms and apartments
Your space is your space. Although it may sound ridiculous, space
is one of the major reasons cited by college students for leaving a
dorm, an apartment, or even a sports program. Keep this in mind
as you tour your possible living quarters.
Despite what you may hear, not every college athlete lives in the
athletic dorms. Some smaller colleges simply don’t have dorm
rooms designated for student-athletes, while others are so over-
crowded that athletes may live off campus. Some student-athletes
ask to live outside the athletic dorms for academic, work, or per-
sonal reasons, while other athletes could never imagine not living
in the athletic dorms. For the latter group, living in the dorms is
part of the whole college experience.
Where and how you live will greatly affect both your academic and
athletic career.
Chapter 10: The Play-by-Play of College Visits 165
How high can you jump?
If you think you have the talent to play at the Division II or NAIA level, but you haven’t
received much interest from or exposure to these schools, a tryout may be the
answer to your scholarship prayers. It can give an opportunity to show a coach your
skills.
The tryout may include tests to evaluate your performance as an athlete. You may
be tested for strength, stamina, speed, agility, and sports-specific skills. Except for
football, ice hockey, lacrosse, and wrestling, your tryout may include a competition.
So bring your game!

For many college freshman, the first year away from home is a
shock. Living with other people is even more shocking. As you con-
sider where you might live, also think about how you might live. Try
to tour the dorms when things are in full swing.
You’ll want to consider even seemingly minor details before set-
tling into dorm life. If you move into a dorm room, you need to con-
sider the following:
 How big is your bathroom, and where is it? Many dorm
bathrooms are down the hall, and you share the bathroom
with the entire floor. Some dorms have private or semiprivate
bathrooms, where you and your roommate may share a bath-
room with another room of a couple people.
 With whom will you be sharing closet space?
 Do you have a refrigerator, or will it be provided?
 Will you have to share a room?
 Where will you do laundry?
Don’t take a tour when a majority of the student body is gone (like
on summer vacation or spring break). Be sure to view dorm living
in the middle of the day and, if possible, in the evening. The sights,
sounds, and smells of an active dorm are often the most important
experiences in helping you make your decisions.
If you need to or want to live off campus, there are many questions
you need to consider (and answer) before finding an apartment:
 Where is the apartment in relation to campus?
 Is there bus transportation to and from campus?
 How close are you to a grocery store? If you don’t have a car,
how will you transport bags of groceries?
 What was the landlord’s or management’s relationship with
previous tenants?
 What is the landlord’s or management’s track record for fixing
plumbing, air-conditioning, or heating problems?
 Would you need roommates? If so, how would you find
responsible ones?
Contact campus and local police departments regarding safety and
security on and off campus.
Part III: Making College Visits 
166

Being Watched: Putting 
Your Best Foot Forward
The whole idea of visiting a school is to check it out and see
whether it’s a nice fit for you, right? Not entirely. Remember that
while you’re looking at the school, the school is looking at you.
On an unofficial visit, you’ll still want to look and behave your best.
But you need to approach an official visit as you would a job inter-
view. A coach and athletic director may meet you during an official
visit, only later to withdraw his interest because you made a poor
impression. Appearing cocky, overconfident, or ready to party on
is not the way to wow a coaching staff.
Pre-interviewing
Before your visit, do some practice interviews with your friends
and family. Have your parents, legal guardians, and high school
coaches pose interview-type questions to you. For example:
 What do you expect to get from your experience at this school?
 What do you have to offer the team? The coaching staff?
 What kind of player would your current coach say you are?
Are you a team player? What would she say about your work
ethic?
 What would your teammates say behind your back?
 What are your greatest strengths? Your greatest weakness?
How can you improve?
 Who is your role model, and why?
 How important are academics to you? How important have
they been in high school?
Do some research on the school and its history. Then, while you
talk to a coach, athletic director, student host, or trainer, you can
mention something about the school’s history, previous athletic
records, a particular alumnus, or interesting facts about the
school’s founding. In other words, show an interest in the school
beyond the fact that they’re interested in you.
Chapter 10: The Play-by-Play of College Visits 167

Selling yourself
You’ve heard that first impressions are everything. Many times,
they are. The way you hold yourself; whether you look people in
the eye; and how you walk, talk, and dress will carry a lot of weight
with the coach and/or athletic director.
Schools invest a lot of money in scholarship athletes, so the coaches
need reassurance that if they give you a scholarship, their money
will be well spent. Will you turn out to be a discipline problem? A
party animal? A slacker? A prima donna?
Read on for ways to make a good impression.
Arriving on time
You’ve made an appointment to meet someone at the college
you’re visiting, whether officially or unofficially. It doesn’t matter
whether the meeting is with the dean, coach, trainer, or student
host: Be on time. If you’re going to be late, call the person you’re
scheduled to meet with, and let him know.
Standing tall and being positive
Be confident, not cocky. This is your best opportunity to let the
school meet you as a student, not just an athlete. Most likely, they
know of your abilities on the court or field, but they’ll have less
understanding of your approach to academics. Use personal meet-
ings with college officials as a time to let them know you, the person.
Remain positive when discussing teammates, current and previous
coaches, and the recruiting process. Let it be known that you’re
both honored and excited about the opportunities ahead.
Dressing the part
You’re a standout athlete, but you don’t need to appear as though
you just came off the court. Dress to impress and for success. No,
you don’t have to wear a dress or a suit and tie, but you do need to
appear neat, clean, and appropriately dressed. Leave the excess
jewelry, nose rings, and tongue piercing at home. If you have tat-
toos, cover them. Your school of interest wants to visualize a
jersey with their school colors on your back, making them proud,
not embarrassing them.
Your clothing and appearance make their own statement about
who you are. Serious about your future? Arrogant? A team-oriented
person? You can control the message you convey.

168

Staying grounded
Perhaps one of the best-loved athletes of all time was basketball
sensation Michael Jordon. He was a marketing director’s dream, a
coach’s fantasy, and a teammate’s best friend. He was humble, sin-
cere, hard-working, and honest. While you’re being recruited, all
the hype can be overwhelming. Instead of believing the hype, stay
focused on the job at hand — closing the deal with the school you
want to attend and the team you want to join.
You’re visiting the school to be part of a team — not a standout.
Sending a thank-you note
As soon as you’ve returned home, send a thank-you note to the
coach and athletic director. Whether you send an e-mail or a per-
sonal note, this is a great way to recap your meeting and remind
people of who you are and how appreciative you are of their efforts.
You can be sure that not all the prospects will take the time to say
thanks — writing a thank-you note gives you another way to show
everyone how special you are.

Chapter 11
Taking Your Turn to Recruit
In This Chapter
 Looking at the success rate of your school
 Researching your favorite programs
 Checking references
 Turning the tables: Interviewing the schools of your choice
W
hat is college? Parties, independence, money, a road to suc-
cess in business, a means to play upper-level sports, and —
oh, yeah — education. Although we hope that education is first
and foremost in your mind, everyone is driven by his or her own
desire. Whatever your motivation and drive, understanding what
you’re getting into is vital — and that understanding will come only
when you ask questions. Many questions. Remember: This is your
turn to recruit the college of your choice.
MIT graduate and CEO Cristina Dolan believes wholly in research,
particularly before any interviews. A standout in the world of tech-
nology, and president and CEO of WordStream, Dolan always
turned the tables during job interviews on her way to the top. Her
philosophy has always been to interview the company — rather
than the other way around — to see if she wanted to work for
them. She always asked potential employers two important ques-
tions: “Why would I want to work for you?” and “What do you have
to offer me?”
You should be asking such questions of the schools you’re consid-
ering attending: “Why should I attend this school and play for your
team?” and “What do you have to offer me?” It shouldn’t be enough
for you that a particular college has great colors or a cute mascot.
Take time to analyze what the college experience means to you and
what you hope to gain from attending a school. Then research,
research, research. In this chapter, we show you how.

Research, Research, Research
What if, since you were 10 years old, you’ve known that you
wanted to play for a certain school? You love everything about that
school: its traditions, its colors, its dedication to your sport. You
love the students, the location, and even the mascot. Everything is
perfect about that school. Why should you even bother looking
around when you know this is what you want? Wouldn’t research-
ing other schools, taking notes, and thinking hard about the best
choice just be a waste of time?
Don’t fall into the same trap so many high school athletes do by
assuming that your acceptance to your dream school is a sure
thing. Researching and applying to other schools is the only way to
avoid ending up empty handed. But let’s assume that you’re one of
the few college-bound student-athletes whose acceptance to your
dream school is a lock. Why should you continue to do research
when you already know where you’re going?
First of all, you still need to make a good impression with the faculty,
admissions counselors, and coach/athletic-department staff of your
college. You get only one chance to make a good first impression.
And that first impression will stay with these people — people who
have some degree of control over your life — for your entire colle-
giate career. So it’s important to research your school to prepare
for your entrance interviews. But there are other important, long-
range reasons to do research. Here are some of them:
 Research opens doors, allowing you to make more contacts
and talk to new people.
 Research will help you better understand the academic world.
 Research will help you better understand athletic scholar-
ships and prevent you from making very costly mistakes.
 Research will allow you to have more intelligent, thoughtful
conversations with coaches, faculty members, admissions
officers, and directors.
 Research will open your eyes to new ideas and new traditions
at schools other than the one you’ve loved since you were 10.
 Research will help you in making decisions.
 Research will give you confidence.
 Research allows you to be more open-minded.
 Research helps you think strategically.
Part III: Making College Visits 
172

 Research can give you a point of reference from which you
can better view your future.
 Research will allow you to identify new problems to be 
considered.
 Research will allow you to identify new solutions to old 
problems.
Diving into college without proper research is a lot like diving into
a bobsled for the first time: You’re completely unprepared for the
disasters to come. Flying headfirst at 80 miles per hour, you’d have
to ask yourself (or, rather, scream to yourself), “What am I doing?!
Why am I doing this?! Why am I here?!” No bobsledder with a lick of
sense would simply jump into such danger without practice, train-
ing, and coaching. No extreme-sport athlete, from Nordic ski jumpers
to professional bull riders, would. But college isn’t the same as an
enraged bull, right? Well, while you’re not likely to be crushed by a
speeding bobsled or gored by a mad bull on campus, a bad college
experience can be even more painful than these extreme accidents.
Bobsledders and bull riders generally lick their wounds, heal, and
move on. But a bad college decision can mean a lost scholarship, fail-
ing grades, or a disappointing academic career.
Mercifully, there are much safer ways to find out about the college
experience than just diving in headfirst.
Checking Up on Your 
Favorite Programs
At the beginning of this chapter, we asked the question “What is
college?” Our next question is “Did you have an answer?” After all,
your answer is imperative. Before you can determine where you
should go, you need to truly understand what matters to you.
All-state champion pole vaulter Nick Frawley was heavily recruited
by colleges from around the nation. By the time he was a junior, he
knew that he wanted to fly planes for a living and continue jumping
as long as he could. This immediately narrowed down the list of
potential schools. Frawley was looking exclusively at schools with
strong aerospace and fighter-pilot programs — and, obviously,
good track-and-field programs.
The Frawley family arranged family vacations around nearby col-
leges with such programs. They visited Cornell, as well as the
Naval and Air Force academies. At the same time that many
schools were busily following Nick’s athletic career, he was
Chapter 11: Taking Your Turn to Recruit 173

researching all the schools, looking for the best possible fit. Nick
compiled a list of wants and needs that were high on his list:
weather, geographic location, access to fly, academic records, and
athletic facilities. As an honor student with an outstanding
extracurricular and athletic résumé, Frawley knew what he would
bring to a college. So his new questions, in Cristina Dolan fashion,
became “Why would I want to go to that school?” and “What would
they have to offer me?”
To focus your research as Nick did, talk to your school counselor
to gather more information about specific schools according to
your wants and needs. Although most experienced counselors
agree that in-person visits are the best way to determine whether a
school is for you, a variety of other avenues to research schools
are available, including the following:
 Seek the advice of friends and family who are in college or
who have recently graduated. What did they like or dislike?
Did they go to a big school with 200 students in most classes?
Did they go to a “suitcase school,” where everyone went
home on the weekends? Or was it a big party school? The key
to remember is this: Schools are like snowflakes and finger-
prints. Although they may appear to be similar, each one is
unique. And, ultimately, it will be up to you to make the most
of your college experience.
 Make a list of potential schools, and check their official Web
sites. This is a great initial step. Just by browsing the Web,
you’ll find out about the history and achievements of each
school. Remember that the official school Web sites are not
only a way for the schools to let people know about them, but
also an opportunity for the schools to post bragging rights. So
the picture you get from looking at a school’s Web site is a lot
like looking at the Web site for your favorite athletic-shoe
manufacturer — lots of hype and nothing negative. Still, you
can get basic, important facts like location, student-body size,
and academic and athletic reputations.
 Attend college fairs. These one- or two-day events allow
schools to set up booths and have representatives from the
school’s admissions office on hand to answer your questions.
College fairs are usually regional or even local, and they’re a
great way to get information and brochures on as many
schools as you want, in addition to applications for admis-
sions and financial aid. The National College Fairs Program,
which sponsors about 35 college fairs around the country
each year, sends information to local high school counselors.
So ask your guidance counselor to tell you about college fairs
near you or check the Web at www.nacacnet.org.
Part III: Making College Visits 
174

Identify some schools you want to investigate at the fair, have
questions prepared for the college reps, and write down their
answers with the pen and notebook that you bring. Ask ques-
tions about admissions and financial-aid application dead-
lines, the deadline for choosing your major, special placement
tests that may be required of incoming freshmen, the school’s
enrollment and average class size, whether graduate students
teach core classes, and so on. To prepare more for college
fairs, visit the following Web sites:
• www.collegeboard.com
• www.petersons.com
• www.schoolguides.com/calendar.asp
• www.schoolsintheusa.com/college_fairs.cfm
 Take virtual campus tours. Although actually visiting a
campus is the best way to find out about the school’s environ-
ment, visiting isn’t always possible. If you absolutely can’t
visit a campus in person, take a virtual tour of the campuses
in which you’re interested. Visit these Web sites to take virtual
tours:
• www.campustours.com
• www.college-visits.com
• www.collegiatechoice.com
• www.ecampustours.com
 Find the best schools and sports programs. Research college
and university rankings in academics and athletics to find out
about scholastic achievements as well as athletic success,
standout athletes, and the winningest coaches. U.S. News &
World Report publishes an annual ranking of America’s best col-
leges, from academics to athletics. (See www.usnews.com/
usnews/edu/college/rankings/rankindex_brief.php
and www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/sports/
sportsindex.htm.) Princeton Review (www.princeton
review.com/college/research/rankings/rankings.
asp), the Riley Guide (www.therileyguide.com), and Yahoo!
Education Directory (http://dir.yahoo.com/Education/
Higher_Education/College_and_University_Planning)
also rank schools annually, including such issues as academics,
demographics, social life, and sports. Another helpful Web
site that gives links to college ranking services as well as
related articles and books is www.library.uiuc.edu/
edx/rankings.htm.
 Research college life online. Got more questions? In addition
to following the links in the Web sites listed earlier in this list,
Chapter 11: Taking Your Turn to Recruit 175

read articles posted online on topics from acing the admis-
sions essay to the do’s and don’ts of college life, from which
schools are the biggest party schools to how to overcome
homesickness your freshman year.
By researching on the Web, you’ll find dozens of excellent
resources to help guide you in a better direction to find out
more about potential colleges; what they offer; and their rela-
tionships with government agencies, recruiting, academics,
and athletics. Here are several such resources:
• www.campusdirt.com
• www.collegeanduniversity.net
• www.colleges.com

• www.fafsa.com
• www.findarticles.com
• www.makingitcount.com
• www.nacacnet.com
• www.nextstepmag.com
For many more helpful online resources, see Appendix B.
 Research campus culture. There’s one more avenue of
research you should pursue: specific cultures you may belong
to or be interested in. It’s just one more aspect of life that may
make the college/campus experience more enjoyable for you.

Everyone has his or her own opinion about which school is best.
No matter how well intentioned they are, your high school coun-
selor, parents, aunts, uncles, or neighbors will want to weigh in on
what is best for you. This is where your own personal research will
help you make the best choice for you — not for Uncle Chuck from
Kalamazoo.
By researching schools — their academic and athletic reputations,
and their faculty and staff — you can make very informed decision.
But be realistic in your research. Consider your grades, how great
your athletic talent really is, and how hard you’re willing to work
before (and after) making the team. And be realistic about where
you’re going to be happy living (on a large campus or a small one?
in a big city or a rural area?).
Chapter 11: Taking Your Turn to Recruit 177
Bigger is not necessarily better
One of the most common misconceptions students have when choosing a school
has to do with size. By sheer size, a university must be better than a small college,
right? And Division I must be better than Division II. Certainly, there are advantages
to being in a Division I school, but depending upon your needs, bigger does not nec-
essarily mean better. In fact, many smaller Division II or NAIA schools are among
the best academic universities in the nation. And if you’re looking for more one-on-
one interaction with your professors, smaller is usually better.
Big schools offer
 Well-known faculty and a large number of faculty members
 Diverse course offerings
 Diverse student body
 Excellent academic facilities (library, laboratories)
 Excellent recreational facilities (gyms, fields, courts) and extensive intramural
program
 Big-time sports programs
 Lower tuition and fees (frequently)
But the disadvantages of big schools include
 Large and impersonal classes. (If you don’t want to sit in a classroom with as
many as 300 students, a big school may not be for you.)
 Graduate students (instead of professors) teaching lower-level or nongraduate
classes.
(continued)

Calling References: Don’t Be
Afraid to Ask
There is nothing like walking the campus, talking to students, and
attending a few classes to get the feel of a school. But if you can’t
make the unofficial or official visit, or if you simply want more
information, nothing beats picking up the telephone.
Part III: Making College Visits 
178
 Difficulty getting into classes because of the large student body.
 More frequent standardized tests (true/false, multiple choice) in large classes,
which can limit students’ creativity.
 Limited housing on campus.
 Difficulty getting around or parking on campus.
The advantages of smaller schools include
 Excellent student-faculty ratios and easy access to senior faculty members.
(You’ll often see student-faculty ratios expressed as a number like 10:1, which
means there are 10 students for every 1 faculty member. The fewer students
per faculty member, the more one-on-one attention you’re likely to receive.)
 Small classes and fewer standardized tests.
 Availability of offered classes.
 Availability of on-campus housing.
 Easier times getting around campus.
 Friendlier and more-personalized campus experience.
 More opportunity to play sports (potentially two varsity sports).
And the disadvantages of smaller schools include
 Less diversity in course offerings
 Less diverse student body
 Fewer faculty members and fewer well-known faculty members
 Fewer campus resources like computer labs, libraries, dorms, and dining halls
 Fewer recreational facilities and activities
 Smaller sports program
 More-expensive tuition (frequently)
(continued)

You can refer to catalogues for faculty and staff names or browse
the Web site. Faculty members will almost always be very frank
and open with you. They see students every day and are commit-
ted to helping them succeed. They don’t want to see anyone get in
over his head. You may also want to speak to someone in admis-
sions, as well as the student-body president, the librarian, or even
reporters at the school newspaper.
Talk to students
Here’s a list of questions to ask students at the school:
 How many hours do you study for each class? How many
hours a day? A week?
 How many pages do you have to read for a typical assignment?
 What is the average class size?
 Are professors accessible outside class, and how do you get
in touch with them?
 Do you usually get the classes you register for?
 Do professors or grad students teach most of the classes?
 Are there any professors who are not native-English speakers
who are difficult to understand?
 Is there a tutoring service on campus? How good is it?
 Is there a career counseling center on campus? Do many stu-
dents use its services?
 Do most students live on or off campus?
 Do you like the surrounding town? Is it big or small? Urban or
rural?
 Does the town have restaurants, movie theaters, nightclubs,
museums, parks, a shopping mall? 
 Are the dorms single-sex or coed? Quiet or noisy?
 Do the dorms have computer labs?
 How strict are the dorm rules?
 Are parties allowed in the dorms? Is alcohol allowed in the
dorms?
 How good is the cafeteria food?
 What hours is the cafeteria open?
 Do most upperclassmen eat in the cafeteria or off campus?
Chapter 11: Taking Your Turn to Recruit 179

 What is transportation like on and off campus?
 How frequently do school buses run, and where do they go off
campus?
 Do you need to have a car to go to school here?
 Is there a waiting list for parking permits?
 Is there enough parking?
 Is there a grocery store within walking distance of campus?
 How safe is it on campus? Off campus?
 Where is the health center, and what are its hours?
 Does the health center have a good reputation? What about
the campus police?
 What percentage of students are Greek (fraternity/sorority)?
 Are there many parties on the weekends?
 Are there many extracurricular activities on campus — 
intramural sports, student organizations, and so on?
 Why did you choose to attend this school?
 Do you have any regrets about your decision?
 What do you wish you had known before you chose to attend
this school?
 What are some negative aspects about this school?
 What will you miss most about this school after you graduate?
 How are athletes viewed by nonathletes here? By faculty?
 Do athletes miss a lot of classes for games?
 How much studying time do athletes actually have?
 What is the coach’s relationship with the team? What is he or
she like?
 What is the coach’s relationship with the school paper, the
faculty, the president?
 How does the team get along?
Talk to faculty
Talking to professors is just as important as talking to students.
What you want are good teachers who are interested in teaching.
Unlike in high school, where teachers are there strictly to teach
(and supervise), many college professors are actually there as
Part III: Making College Visits 
180

much to do research as they are to teach. And with a few profes-
sors, teaching can sometimes take a backseat to research.
Many colleges flaunt the names of famous scholars or writers who
are faculty members. But you may never see that high-profile per-
sonality in a classroom.
What you should be most concerned with is the quality of educa-
tion you’ll receive — not the impressive list of faculty you may
never even meet.
As you begin to research the classroom atmosphere of your school
of choice, have a prepared list to ask faculty members:
 What is the average class size?
 What is the student-faculty ratio?
 Who teaches more classes: faculty or graduate students?
 How many professors teach freshman courses?
 How accessible are you and other professors during nonclass
hours?
 How good is the department in my major?
 What is the study load for students in your class? In other
classes?
 How realistic is that study load for an athlete on scholarship?
 How do the students at this school compare with students at
other schools where you’ve taught?
 What percentage of students graduate? What percentage of
students graduate in four years?
 What percentage of athletes graduate? What percentage of
players on scholarship graduate? How many graduate in four
years?
 How many freshmen fall below a 2.0 GPA? How many of those
freshmen are athletes?
 How many credit hours should I take in a semester in season
and out of season?
 Is tutoring available?
 If I have a diagnosed, documented learning disability, what
kind of academic services are available?
 Will I have an advisor to help me with scheduling?
 Who will be my faculty advisor?
Chapter 11: Taking Your Turn to Recruit 181

 How does college work differ from high school work?
 Why do students leave this college?
 What are the most common complaints by students?
 Is summer school available?
 Is cheating a common problem at this school? How is it 
dealt with?
 What is the attendance policy?
 What is the reputation of athletes among the faculty?
 How lenient are faculty with athletes’ conflicting schedules?
Looking at Graduation Rates 
and Academic Successes
Two-thirds of college students change their majors at least once,
often twice, before graduating from college. Most graduates make a
major job change within the first five years after graduating, pursu-
ing a career that has little or nothing to do with their major.
Nothing is ever as straightforward as it seems.
You’re offered a scholarship; so you plan to attend the school, play
hard, study harder, graduate, and move on to better things. Right?
It seems so simple. But scholarships can be lost due to injury or
poor academic performance. That’s all the more reason for you to
be sure that the school you attend is a good fit; that you’re com-
fortable with the academic structure and core curriculum; and that
you want to be there not only as an athlete, but also as a student.
Research what happens to students after graduation and how
many actually graduate. Call faculty or administrators, check the
Web site of your school, or visit www.collegeresults.org to
find answers to the following questions:
 How realistic is the study load for students at the school, par-
ticularly for student-athletes?
 What the graduation rate of students in general?
 What is the graduation rate of student-athletes? How many
graduate in four years? In five years?
 What percentage of graduates continue in higher education?
 What percentage of graduates get jobs? What kind of jobs do
they get, and what are their starting salaries?
Part III: Making College Visits 
182

 What is the school’s reputation among business leaders in the
community?
 How proactively does the school career counseling center
work with students?
 How does the college rate itself in terms of preparing students
for graduation and life after graduation?
 How many student-athletes turn pro after graduation?
(Continue asking this question throughout your academic
career — the answer will keep your feet on the ground and
remind you that getting an education is key.)
The Web site mentioned earlier, www.collegeresults.org, will
give you graduation rates and other information for your college.
Paying attention to athletic success
and coaching changes
Sometimes when you want something badly enough, you can easily
overlook indiscretions or problems. People do this in personal
relationships, in business, and when choosing schools. Don’t let
this happen to you. We’ve cautioned you to be sure that the school
you choose is a match for you socially and academically. But you
also need to be sure that the athletic program you’re joining is one
you’ll be happy with.
You can check up on the athletic department of your potential
school-to-be and make good decisions.
Visit the school’s Web site, and check out its sports records. It
doesn’t matter what your parents, friends, or coaches tell you
about how well this season or previous seasons have gone. See for
yourself. For one thing, how well a sports program does or doesn’t
do may be a reflection of the coaching staff and, in many cases,
coaching changes.
If a sports program does very well, certain members of the coach-
ing staff may have the chance to move on to a different school and
coaching position. A high turnover rate among coaches is not nec-
essarily a bad thing, because success reaps rewards for coaches
who start new programs at other schools. But if you notice that a
sports program is continuously struggling and the coaching staff is
always turning over, this may indicate serious problems within the
athletic department of the school you’re considering. And this is a
red flag you shouldn’t ignore.
Chapter 11: Taking Your Turn to Recruit 183

Probing colleges on probation
Major-infraction cases are open to the public, and you can find
information on them at the school’s conference Web site. This is a
valuable tool that allows you to type in the name of the school
you’re researching or a specific time frame. For example, you may
want to know what major infractions have occurred in a certain
time frame. By keying in this time frame, you’ll discover all the
schools that have been placed on probation.
Here are the Web addresses you’ll need:
 NCAA: Go to www2.ncaa.org/legislation_and_
governance/compliance and click Legislative Tools for the
list of NCAA schools on probation.
 NAIA: Go to http://naia.collegesports.com/
member-services/legislative.
 NJCAA: Go to www.njcaa.org and click NJCAA Office of
Eligibility Probation List.
Research is the name of your game now. Even if you don’t think
there is a problem with your school of interest, check it out to be
sure. There is no such thing as too much knowledge.

Preparing for and Evaluating
Each Visit
In This Chapter
 Preparing for the college interview
 Knowing what questions to ask
 Knowing what questions to anticipate
 Having a productive interview
You’ve narrowed down your list of the colleges you want to
attend. Perhaps you’ve already visited them to get a lay of the
land. But now you’ve been invited for an official visit and an inter-
view. Now it isn’t just about whether you would like to go to this
school; it’s about whether this school is interested in you. In this
chapter, we help you prepare for a successful interview; we give
you suggestions on what types of questions you should be asking
school officials and what types of questions you should anticipate
being asked by them; and we give you tips on how to be informed
and professional in your interview. The rest is up to you!
Getting Ready for the Interview
At this point in the game, you should have already made your lists
of what you need and want in a college. You also should have lists
of questions to ask students and faculty at the schools you visit
(see Chapter 11). Your questions will help you make decisions
about the schools from both an academic standpoint (for example,
does the school have a good department in the major you’re con-
sidering?) and a social standpoint (for example, are you comfort-
able on campus?).
Now you need to make a list of questions to ask the coaches and
athletic directors you visit so you can make informed decisions

about the schools’ athletic programs as well. In addition, you need
to anticipate and write down the questions that these people will
ask you.
After you have a list of questions, practice these question-and-
answer sessions with someone (a parent, a high school coach, a
mentor) who will give you constructive feedback and suggestions —
you don’t want to be surprised or confused by a question during
your official interview.
The impression you make during your interview will most likely
determine whether you receive a letter of admission or rejection.
So be prepared: Practice, practice, practice!
When you’ve been officially invited to a college for an interview,
research that school’s history, traditions, its president, its faculty,
its athletic department, its athletic director, and the coach of your
sport. Be sure to get the correct names and titles of anyone with
whom you’ll be interviewing. (You can look up this information on
the college’s official Web site.) Getting a person’s name or title
wrong is a terrible way to begin an interview; it’s disrespectful and
tells that person that you aren’t serious about going to her school.
Find out whether there have been any scandals, any NCAA viola-
tions, any student protests or accusations. You can find this infor-
mation at the NCAA’s official Web site:
1. Go to www.ncaa.org.
2. Click Legislation & Governance.
3. Under Helpful Links, click Legislative Services Database
(LSDBi).
4. On the left side of the page, click Major Infractions.
You’ll be able to search the database for the school you’re
interested in.
In doing your research, your goal isn’t to humiliate your interview-
ers by discussing unpleasant or embarrassing episodes in the
school’s history. Instead, your research will give you broad knowl-
edge about the school’s history, traditions, student body, and so
on — knowledge that will help you make an educated decision
about whether or not you want to attend this school, knowledge
that will give you extra confidence in the interview (always a plus),
and knowledge that will not go unnoticed by your interviewers.
If your research turns up some potentially negative information,
you’re entitled to ask questions and get answers — particularly
Part III: Making College Visits 
186

about such issues as NCAA violations and potential probation or
rumors that the head coach may be leaving. Don’t be afraid to ask
the coach, during your interview, how long he intends to stay with
the school. Perhaps you wanted to go to this school because of
this particular coach. By asking when his coaching contract ends
or whether he’s being seriously recruited by other schools, you
may get information that leads you not to commit to this school.
This method isn’t foolproof (there’s no law that the coach has to
tell you everything), but it may at least give you a clue as to what
your coach has in mind.
Your research also will demonstrate to school officials that you’re
seriously interested in their school. If the school you’re visiting has
special traditions (such as Texas A&M University’s 12th Man or
Notre Dame’s Four Horsemen), you should know about those tradi-
tions, just as you should know what (or who) the school’s mascot
is. Also, many college buildings are named after people who are
important to the school’s history. If a coach or a faculty member
makes a reference to a building or to a name, you should know
about it. If you’ve obviously done your homework and know about
the school, you’ll impress the people with whom you interview. It
shows you have a real desire to be there.
Asking the Important Questions
In the height of excitement of meeting new coaches, visiting new
places, and being flattered by recruitment salesmanship, you can
easily become overwhelmed and overlook what may later appear
to be pretty big or obvious problems. If you come to your college
interview with prepared questions in hand, you can head off many
of these problems and make a more informed, intelligent decision
about your future. In short, you can prevent decisions you may
later regret.
More than 70 percent of college students have experienced varying
degrees of such regret about their college choice and about their aca-
demic careers. Many of those students are athletes who suddenly
wondered “Why didn’t I see this when I interviewed with the coaches
or college?” or “Why didn’t I ask about this before I signed on?”
One student in this situation was a well-known athlete who was
being heavily recruited by several high-profile Division I schools.
As one of the hottest athletes in the nation, owning two national
records and showing great potential as a two-sport athlete, she
had her pick of colleges. But she had narrowed her choices down
to two schools.
Chapter 12: Preparing for and Evaluating Each Visit 187

School A had an excellent academic reputation with renowned fac-
ulty in her major. Its athletic reputation was equally attractive,
with a strong sense of camaraderie among the athletes and coach-
ing staff. School B also boasted academic and athletic acclaim, but
it was much closer to her home. Encouraged by her family, she
chose School B, believing this was the wiser choice of the two. She
and her family had been so enamored with the geographic location
of the school that they hadn’t paid attention to the relationship
between the athletes and coaching staff.
Later, the discouraged athlete acknowledged that she hadn’t even
noticed the contentious relationship between the athletes and the
coach — until it was too late. During her junior and senior years,
many of her teammates transferred to other schools. This very
tumultuous time stressed her out — both personally and academi-
cally. And it could have been prevented.
To avoid such undue stress and potentially damaging decisions, be
sure to carefully think about (and then write down) the issues that
are important to you in choosing a college — the questions you’ll
ask a college interviewer.
Following are several examples of questions you should ask. If you
practice question-and-answer sessions in mock interviews (where
you role-play with your parent or a teacher or coach), you’ll go
into each interview with greater confidence and impress your
interviewers. Plus, if you have questions written down, you’ll be
sure not to forget important questions — and when you write
down the answers, you’ll be sure to remember everything you
were told and impressions that you formed.
Bringing notes to an interview is a great idea. Rather than looking
nervous or childish, you’ll appear well prepared and eager to have
all your questions answered.
Here are some important questions to ask the coach:
 What positions will I play on your team?
 Who else are you recruiting for my position?
 Will I be redshirted my first year?
 What expectations do you have for training and conditioning?
 How would you best describe your coaching style?
 When does the head coach’s contract end?
 What percentage of players on scholarship graduate in four
years?
Part III: Making College Visits 
188

 What percentage of students return after their freshman year?
 What is the student-to-faculty ratio?
 What is the typical class size?
 How much time will I be allowed for studying?
 Will I be required to live on campus throughout my athletic
participation?
 How long does my scholarship last?
 What happens to my scholarship/financial aid if I’m injured?
 What happens to my scholarship if there is a change in
coaches?
You can find more questions regarding athletics, academics, finan-
cial aid, and college life by visiting the NCAA Initial-Eligibility
Clearinghouse Web site. Go to www.ncaa.org, click Prospective
Student-Athletes, and then click The Guide for College-Bound
Student-Athletes. Appendix C of the NCAA guide has “Questions to
Ask as You Consider Colleges.”
To keep your questions — and your thoughts — organized, write
each question on a 3-x-5-inch note card. Be sure to leave space on
each card to write your answers. 
Giving Intelligent Answers to 
the Questions You’re Asked
Being able to answer intelligently the questions coaches and staff
ask you is as important as asking intelligent questions of them,
because it shows that you care about your education and you care
about attending the school you’re visiting.
Remarkably, one of the most common questions asked by athletic
directors and coaches remains the biggest stumper among student-
athletes: What are your needs, and how can our school provide for
those needs? Coaches and staff want to see that you have the
answers to those questions. They want to know that you want to
be at their school. They need to know that you feel committed to
what the school has to offer and are excited to be part of their
team. Shrugging and saying only that you want to play doesn’t
inspire interviewers with great confidence about your dedication,
and it certainly won’t help you when the time comes for them to
make the critical decisions about who to accept and who to deny.
Chapter 12: Preparing for and Evaluating Each Visit 189

Other questions to anticipate include the following:
 Why are you interested in this college?
 What are you interested in studying at this college?
 What are your postcollege goals?
 What are your strengths?
 What are your weaknesses?
 How do you handle adversity?
 What do you do in your spare time? What are your other 
interests?
 What was the last book you read?
 Who is your favorite author, and why?
 Tell me about yourself. How would your best friend 
describe you?
 In what ways have you served in your community?
 What are some of your concerns about the nation/world today?
If you could change one thing in the world, what would it be?
 Why should I choose you over the other student-athletes com-
peting for your spot?
 What are your plans if you’re accepted at this institution?
 Do you have any questions?
Yes, coaches will ask you questions about your outside interests.
They want athletes on their team who care about things other than
just the sport they play. One reason for this is that student-athletes
who focus only on their sport are more likely to burn out. Having
outside interests makes you not only more interesting and appeal-
ing as a person, but also more reliable and solid as an athlete. To
borrow from the movie Jerry Maguire, it completes you.
Nailing the Interview
When the big day comes, it’s important to set the stage for suc-
cess. You’ve put a lot of work into this interview, and you want to
be sure to get out of it all the information you need. Still, there is
no need to be nervous — as long as you’re prepared and practiced.
This is not a pass/fail test; it’s just a conversation (albeit a some-
what formal conversation).
Part III: Making College Visits 
190

Come prepared to ask and answer questions, but be sure that your
questions are appropriate for this college and not generic ques-
tions that you’ve simply memorized from sample question lists. Be
prepared to talk about yourself, about your strengths and weak-
nesses. You want to be spontaneous and at ease, but not arrogant.
Remember: There is a fine line between confidence and arrogance;
you want the former, not the latter.
You can bolster your confidence through practice and moral sup-
port. If having your parents with you at the interview would give
you more confidence, you can bring them — as long as they allow
you to do all the talking. An interviewer shouldn’t mind having an
extra set of ears in the room — but well-intentioned parents can
quickly become intrusive and disruptive. Your parents should be
there only as moral support.
Even if you aren’t sure that this is the school you want to attend,
you should try to make a good impression in case you decide you
do want to apply. And even if you’re pretty sure that you don’t want
to attend this school, you should approach this interview —
indeed, every interview — as an opportunity to perfect your inter-
viewing skills.
To ensure that your interview is a success, here are a few tips:
 Make sure you know exactly where the interview is being
held. Call before the interview to get directions (then make a
practice run so there are no surprises), get the name and title
of the person interviewing you, and find out how long you’ll
be there (again, no surprises).
 Arrive on time. In fact, you should arrive at least 15 minutes
before your interview in order to give yourself time to unwind
and relax (and to find a parking space). Also, check with the
receptionist to be sure you know the proper pronunciation
and title of the person interviewing you. (Mispronouncing
someone’s name is a big no-no.)
 Be polite to the receptionist and any office staff.
 When you enter the interview room, introduce yourself, and
greet the interviewer with a firm handshake and a smile.
 Maintain eye contact and body language that says, “I’m
interested and alert.” Sit up straight, and lean toward the
interviewer to show interest (but don’t lean on the desk).
Don’t cross your arms; you’ll seem bored or unenthusiastic.
 Dress appropriately and professionally. Men should wear a
suit or a jacket and tie. Women should not wear short skirts
or low-cut blouses. Don’t wear too much cologne or perfume.
Chapter 12: Preparing for and Evaluating Each Visit 191

And don’t wear lots of jewelry. (In the case of jewelry and fra-
grance, less is more.)
 Don’t eat, drink, chew gum, or smoke during the interview —
even if you’re offered something to eat or drink.
 Bring your questions on note cards and a pen to jot down
answers and notes to yourself. Be sure the pen has ink, and
bring a spare just in case.
 Don’t place anything on the interviewer’s desk. This
includes your notes; keep those in your lap or in a folder.
 Speak succinctly, and use proper English. Don’t swear or use
too much slang.
 Relax! Remember that a good interview is really just a good
conversation. So don’t just provide “yes” and “no” answers.
 Be positive. Highlight the good things from your past. If the
interviewer brings up negative experiences, try to focus on
what you’ve learned from your mistakes or from adversity.
Remember that problems can be viewed as challenges.
 Always be honest. Lies will come back to haunt you.
 Above all else, just be yourself.
After Your Interview
After your interview, send a thank-you note to the person with
whom you interviewed. This demonstrates that you’re courteous
and mature, and it reinforces the impression you made in the mind
of the interviewer. Remember: The more interest you show in the
school, the more interest the school will show in you.
Before you leave the interviewer’s office, be sure to ask for her
business card. This way, you’ll have the correct spelling of her
name and correct title to use in your thank-you note.
As soon as you return to your hotel room or home, review and
rewrite the notes you took during the interview. By rewriting the
notes right away, you can add notations about the impressions
that are still fresh in your mind. Plus, when you’re rewriting your
notes, you may notice something that you missed before.
Now that you’ve interviewed with some school officials and visited
some different campuses, you have the raw data — in your notes —
to help you choose the school that’s right for you.
Part III: Making College Visits 
192

You need to look first for a college that will allow you to accom-
plish your academic and personal goals. Some of the factors that
may affect your decision include
 The academic major(s) you’re interested in
 The school’s academic reputation
 How prepared you’ll be for graduate or professional school
when you finish undergrad work
 The size of the school
 How close the school is to your hometown
 The setting of the school (urban, rural, small town, and so on)
 Campus life (for example, is there a big Greek system? do most
of the students go home on the weekends or stay on campus?
do they focus more on partying than on schoolwork?)
 Residential opportunities (dorms, apartments, and so on)
Ask yourself about your motivation to attend that school: Do you
want to attend this school to have the chance to do something
you’ve never done before, the chance to demonstrate your inde-
pendence? Or are you just doing what is expected of you?
You also need to look for a college that will allow you to accom-
plish your athletic goals. You’ll need to be honest with yourself
when you assess your own abilities. You can consider other deter-
mining factors by asking yourself a number of questions (and being
honest with your answers):
 Will I be allowed to play more than one sport at that school, if
that’s what I want to do? (Playing two sports would be a possi-
bility in Division III, for example, but probably not in Division I.)
 Will I have a scholarship or financial aid?
 How do I relate to the coaching staff?
 How I describe the coaching style? How do I feel about that
coaching style?
 How do I relate to the other student-athletes?
 What positions would I play on the team?
 Who are the other players competing for my position?
Describe them. What years are they in?
 Will I be likely to play at the school? If not, is it more impor-
tant for me to be part of a bigger, more prestigious program,
even though I may ride the bench?
Chapter 12: Preparing for and Evaluating Each Visit 193

 What are the physical requirements?
 What is the time commitment required?
 What percentage of players graduate in four years? What per-
centage of players graduate?
 What is the academic support for athletes at this college?
 What is the typical day for a student-athlete? A typical 
semester?
 Will I be required to live on campus for my entire athletic 
participation?
 And the ultimate question: If I’m injured and can never com-
pete again, will I accomplish the rest of my goals and be
happy at this school?
Evaluate how you answered these questions. Look to see where
your focus is. College is much like athletic training: You must be
dedicated and passionate about the long-term goals. As an athlete,
you want to hone your skills, make great plays, and be an asset to
your team. As a student, you want to do the same.
Your successes on the field or court are seasonal, but your college
degree will be with you for a lifetime.

Committing
to a School

In this part . . .
You’ll better understand the process of recruiting and
signing a National Letter of Intent before you sign a
ﬁnancial-aid agreement. Before you sign any contract, you
need to understand what you’re signing. In this part, we
remind you that, although this is an exciting time for you
and your family, you need to consider a variety of issues
before signing. Your parents should be a big part of this
process — but, in the end, you’re doing this for you.

 Understanding the terms of a financial-aid agreement
 Knowing what kind of deals you may be offered
 Negotiating the best deal for you
 Talking to the right people
T
his is it! You’ve been working and waiting for this moment.
Being offered a financial-aid agreement between you and a col-
lege or university is a moment that should preview great things to
come: an excellent education; more-intense competition; a possible
platform for professional athletics; and, you hope, a financial break
for you and your family.
In this chapter, we show you how to read a financial-aid offer and
close the best deal for you and your family.
Reading the Agreement
Remarkably, every year, every season, nearly every minute, some-
one signs a financial-aid agreement without understanding the
terms — and without reading the fine print. Even more remarkably,
because an agreement is too long or too confusing, people often
happily accept the school’s watered-down explanation of what the
agreement means.
“Here, just sign here. All this says is blah, blah, blah.” And people
sign. They sign because they want to believe they’re being given
the best deal possible and that they’re being told the truth. But the
stakes are too high simply to sign away a major component of your
future — in this case, your education and athletic career.

Reading between the lines
Financial-aid agreements are not meant to be confusing, but legali-
ties and the school’s obligation to protect its interests (and you as
the student-athlete) often require a lot of words.
Understanding the terms that are presented in the offer is critical.
Here are some terms that may be in your financial-aid agreement,
along with what they mean for you:
 Cost of attendance: An amount calculated by the financial-aid
office at the school, using federal regulations. It includes the
total cost of tuition, fees, room, board, books, supplies, trans-
portation, and other expenses related to attendance at the
institution.
 Counter: A student who is receiving institutional financial aid
that counts toward the maximum financial-aid limitations in a
sport.
 Full grant-in-aid: Financial aid that consists of tuition, fees,
room, board, and required course-related books.
 Initial counter: A counter who is receiving countable financial
aid in a sport for the first time.
 Institutional aid: All funds administered by the college or uni-
versity. This includes, but is not limited to, any scholarship,
grant, tuition waiver, or loan. It also includes any aid from the
government or private sources if the school is responsible for
selecting the recipient or determining the amount of aid.
 Period of the award: The period of the award starts on the
first day of classes for a semester or quarter, or the first day
of practice, whichever is earlier. The period of award ends at
the conclusion of the period set forth in the financial-aid
agreement, which is usually the last day of classes for a
semester or quarter. The grant-in-aid may not be awarded for
more than one academic year.
Signing an agreement should be a time for serious thought and
careful consideration. There should be no one but a trusted
adviser whose first interest is your future looking over your shoul-
der as you read the agreement and make your decision.
Understanding what you’re signing
The financial-aid agreement is the contract you sign that commits
the school to providing you financial assistance to attend the col-
lege or university in return for your playing your sport. It is a
Part IV: Committing to a School 
198

legally binding document signed by you, the athletic director, and
the director of financial aid at the school. Because it is a legally
binding document, as soon as you sign it and return it to the
school, it becomes official.
Before you sign anything, you need to know what the school is offer-
ing. For example, is the scholarship for one semester (fall or spring
term only) or for one full year? Make sure you know what the schol-
arship will cover. Is it just tuition, fees, and books — or is it only
room and board? Some percentage may go to pay for tuition and
fees, and the remainder may go toward room and board — the
agreement will spell all this out.
When the financial-aid agreement has been signed and returned to
the school, the school can increase the value of the scholarship
before the beginning of the semester or quarter, whichever is ear-
lier, but the school may not reduce it — without just cause.
Your scholarship may be terminated. Specifically, under NCAA
rules, your scholarship can be immediately canceled or removed
for the following reasons:
 You become ineligible for intercollegiate competition.
 You fraudulently misrepresent any information on an applica-
tion for assistance, a financial-aid agreement, or the National
Letter of Intent.
 You engage in conduct warranting substantial disciplinary
action.
 You voluntarily withdraw from your sport.
These negative outcomes will likely be listed on the financial-aid
agreement, but keep them in mind in case they aren’t.
It is also important to remember that coaches may have even more
stringent rules about scholarships being terminated, even though
they may not take effect immediately. Case in point: Some coaches
have rules that strictly prohibit drinking alcohol during the season.
If your coach has this rule, and if you violate the rule, you could
lose your scholarship.
Some rules may not be in writing, so you must make sure you know
the coach’s expectations for keeping your scholarship. If your
scholarship is reduced or cut, the school must inform you of this in
writing and give you the opportunity to appeal this decision. The
committee that hears the appeal must be made up of individuals
outside the athletic department. This is important to know in case
you feel your scholarship has been canceled or reduced unfairly.
Chapter 13: Negotiating a Financial-Aid Agreement 199

Knowing what kinds of scholarships
are typically offered
Everywhere you turn, it seems like a teammate or friend is being
offered some kind of scholarship, but remember: Not all scholar-
ships are the same. As we explain in Chapter 2, a scholarship offer
is often based on what the coach is allowed to offer.
College sports are divided into two categories: head-count sports
and equivalency sports (see Chapter 2). At most Division I schools,
scholarships in head-count sports are often full scholarships,
because even if you receive only a small scholarship in these sports,
it counts as one of the maximum that is permitted. For example, in
women’s tennis, if a student-athlete receives a scholarship worth
only $500, her scholarship counts as one of the eight scholarships
permitted by the NCAA in that sport. For equivalency sports (such
as track, swimming, and wrestling), full scholarships are rare — so
rare, in fact, that scholarships in these sports are typically offered
based on percentages so that the overall team limit can be accu-
rately tracked and determined.
Typically, the coach works with a member of the school’s financial-
aid office to ensure the accuracy of the individual and team limits.
If a school awards more scholarships than are permitted, it can be
slapped with penalties that will require scholarship reductions in
the future.
For a complete explanation of the difference between head-count
and equivalency sports, refer to Chapter 2.
Identifying what you want or need in terms of financial relief is
important. You may vie for books rather than training, for a spe-
cific degree rather than board. You and the college recruiter may
be able to reach an agreement (in terms of financial aid) to cover
your academic costs.
Talk to your recruiter and high school counselors about what you
want. You never know what may be available until you ask.
Head coaches are sometimes like general managers of professional
sports teams. Remember: The overall financial-aid team limits
apply to each sport (for example, Division I baseball = 11.7), and
each student-athlete is limited to a certain amount of financial aid.
(See Chapter 2 for more info.) Imagine that the overall financial-aid
team limit is the salary cap for the particular team and that the
scholarship that the student-athlete is receiving is his own salary.
The scholarships the players receive cannot be for more than one
Part IV: Committing to a School 
200

year, so the financial-aid agreement can be equated to a contract.
Each year, the head coach has to sit down and figure out how
much of the “salary cap” he has returning for the next year and
how much can be allocated to new players via “contracts.” And the
negotiating begins. . . .
Understanding the Rules 
of Negotiating
If you’re receiving multiple offers for a full scholarship, this section
probably won’t apply to you because you won’t need to negotiate.
A full scholarship is the most you’re able to receive.
According to the dictionary, negotiate means “to confer with
another or others in order to come to terms or reach an agree-
ment.” You may not think this definition applies to the world of
athletic scholarships, but believe it or not, it does. If you’ve had
the privilege (or the challenge) of purchasing a car, you may get a
similar feeling during this process.
The negotiating process may occur every year for you, because 
the scholarships are renewed each year. For example, you may
improve as a player each year and, based on your performance,
every off season you can negotiate with your coach to receive
more financial aid.
Honing a poker face
With the increased popularity of poker on television these days,
you may think that a poker face includes sunglasses, a hat pulled
way down, and earphones connected to your iPod. In the world of
college scholarships, however, it means keeping your cool and not
negotiating with emotion.
More often than not, a coach is going to offer you less than what
you (or your parents) think you deserve, because that’s human
nature. Don’t show your disappointment if this happens. If a coach
offers you a 25 percent scholarship, and you feel you deserve at
least 40 percent, be prepared to explain exactly why you feel this
way. Don’t simply ask, “Can you make it 40 percent?” Give the
coach reasons you should get a better deal.
Here are some common reasons that you might request more ath-
letic aid:
Chapter 13: Negotiating a Financial-Aid Agreement 201

 I play a skill position that deserves more.
 I can play right away and help the team improve.
 I’m a local player who is well known in the community.
 I’m out of state, so the cost for me to come here is greater.
You and your parents will want to discuss these suggestions and
other points to make about your special skills in case you feel
you’re being undervalued by the offer.
One more thing to remember: Because the coach probably has
gone through this process a lot, don’t expect him to be easily per-
suaded. In some cases, the coach simply may not be able to give
you a bigger scholarship because of the NCAA limits.
You and your family need to know what you want and should expect
from a recruiter before you move into the negotiating process.
Separating fact from fiction
You and your family meet with a recruiter to discuss your possible
scholarship. He offers you a partial scholarship, but you’ve done
your research. You know this school needs an athlete of your cal-
iber, playing your position. You know from previous conversations
that this particular school is very interested in you, and from your
recent official on-campus visit, you believe that you would fit well
with the team and coaching staff. Yet, the recruiter can offer only a
partial scholarship.
You’ve seen this routine before on television, where the car sales-
man claims to be on the side of the consumer but says he just
needs to check with his boss about the deal you and he just made.
As the camera follows the salesman, we see that he merely goes
around the corner; eats a doughnut; drinks some coffee; checks his
watch; makes some random slashing marks on his pad of paper of
facts and figures; and, after some time, returns to the buyer,
making claims of being overruled by the nonexistent boss, who has
a counteroffer —always a higher price.
We like to think this is how all salespeople operate. But the reality
is that your scholarship — or its availability — may already be
determined by NCAA rules and regulations.
We talked to coaches, recruiters, parents, student-athletes, and
athletic directors about negotiating financial-aid offers, and some
common themes came up again and again. Consider this your real-
ity checklist:
Part IV: Committing to a School 
202

 Recruiters can’t always make the final decision. Many times,
the offer they give is the only one they’re permitted based on
the amount of scholarships they have to give. One of the
biggest complaints we hear from recruiters is how often they’ve
made a scholarship offer only to be told later by their own
department that there is no such money. Sometimes, even the
recruiter is unaware of the financial allowances for the college.
 Just because you’re the best in high school doesn’t always
mean you’re the best in college or, for that matter, the best
for a particular team.
 Listen to a few trusted allies — such as your parents, high
school counselor, and other athletes who have done their
own research or have been through the system.
 If you don’t like an offer, it’s okay to ask to renegotiate.
Recruiters will respect this process. However, be sure to act
respectfully and intelligently.
 Keep in mind that money isn’t everything. Some of the best
scholarships offer education (in the form of books and tuition
fees) as the selling point.
 Scholarships don’t have to be strictly athletic scholarships.
A good recruiter can help you work with the financial-aid
department to cover other costs.
Mentioning what other 
schools are offering
Let’s say you’ve gotten an offer from School B for 25 percent, but
you feel you’re worth 40 percent. If School A has offered you 40 per-
cent, you may want to tell the School B coach that you want to
attend his school, but because of finances, you may have to choose
School A because School A has offered you more athletic aid.
Chances are the coach will react in one of the following ways:
 Tell you that the offer he made to you is as high as he can go,
and you need to make a decision based on that
 Increase your scholarship amount to match what School A is
offering you
 Negotiate with you to increase your scholarship offer, but not
quite to what you wanted
 Wish you well at the other school and take back his original
offer (leaving you no choice but to go to School A)
Chapter 13: Negotiating a Financial-Aid Agreement 203

Using this other-offer strategy is very much a gamble and could
backfire on you, so make sure you’re comfortable mentioning
another school’s offer to a coach.
Keep in mind that coaches talk to one another a lot, and if you
aren’t being honest about an offer from another school, there is a
very good chance you could be found out. Just as you expect a
coach to be honest with you regarding other athletes he may be
recruiting, you have to be honest with him when it comes to dis-
cussing scholarship offers from other schools.
Resisting the Pressure
You’ve done the research. You’ve selected your team of trusted
advisors. You know what colleges you want, the degree you hope
to earn, and the direction you want to move in. It’s all laid out in
front of you, and you feel pretty secure about your decisions. Then
comes the pressure.
Suddenly, a coach with an excellent track record and a background
of championships and experience is telling you how things should
go, what you should do, how you can make things happen. But
what he’s saying isn’t the way you had planned it, and suddenly,
you and your family are very confused.
Everything looks great on paper. But now you’re talking to a sea-
soned coach who knows what he wants — and it’s another matter
altogether. What do you do when the coach puts on the pressure?
Read on for answers.
When the coach pressures 
you to sign
Several years ago, the NCAA membership was looking for a way to
cut costs within their athletic departments. This was a few years
before multimillion contracts for coaches became run of the mill. So,
to cut recruiting travel costs — and to the delight of express-delivery
companies all over the country — the NCAA passed a rule prohibit-
ing schools from delivering the National Letter of Intent (NLI) or an
athletic-scholarship agreement to a prospect in person. Although
reducing costs was the initial rationale, there was another reason for
the NCAA’s travel prohibition: to reduce a coach’s ability to pressure
a student-athlete into signing an agreement.
Part IV: Committing to a School 
204

This prohibition applies only to in-person delivery off campus. The
coach can give you an NLI and/or financial-aid statement in person
if you’re visiting the campus. You can even sign it right there, if you
want. (Many administrators, however, frown upon this practice
because the implication that the coach pressured you to do so is
tough to defend.)
Although it has never been publicly addressed, coaches pressuring
athletes to sign has been a huge problem. Over the years, families
have claimed to have been bullied or tricked into various agree-
ments. So, while the NCAA ruling appeared to be a logical solution,
the problem remains.
You may be saying to yourself that you would never allow a coach
to pressure you into signing with a school before you were ready.
Chapter 13: Negotiating a Financial-Aid Agreement 205
Are you committed?
The 1994 documentary Hoop Dreams is an example of the kind of intimidation we’re
talking about in this chapter. In one scene, the student-athlete, William Gates, is at
his home, and the then–head coach of Marquette, Kevin O’Neill, is making an in-
home recruiting visit, trying to persuade Gates to commit to Marquette.
O’Neill basically tells Gates that he is recruiting six or seven student-athletes for
three spots, but if Gates tells the coach that he is coming to Marquette, O’Neill will
stop recruiting the other players at Gates’s position. He goes on to say that if Gates
doesn’t commit and the other players he’s recruiting go elsewhere in the meantime,
O’Neill will have to answer to his athletic director and president if the team strug-
gles. This discussion takes place in front of Gates’s mother and brother (a former
college basketball player himself).
O’Neill didn’t tell Gates anything inaccurate, and the head coach is definitely under
pressure himself to win and put fans in the stands. But telling a 17-year-old or 18-
year-old that if he doesn’t commit to a particular school, his decision may impact
the coach’s job is giving a young athlete information that’s tough to deal with. That
pressure is the kind the NCAA tries to prevent.
Ultimately, Gates did sign with Marquette and lettered for three years, but he never
became an NBA star, as he had hoped. He did, however, graduate from Marquette
with a degree in communications and now works in a ministry in his hometown.
Remember: Understanding your rights as a student-athlete is essential. You should
not be pressured to make your final decisions in the presence of a coach. Had
William Gates’s story taken place today, he would have been allowed to review the
scholarship offer alone with his mother and brother. Who knows what his ultimate
decision might have been?

But you might think differently if the coach says, “If you don’t
commit to me by such-and-such date, I’m going to have to offer
your scholarship to someone else.”
If you’re feeling pressured by a coach, and you aren’t ready to
make a commitment, the best advice we can give you is to be
honest and let the coach know you need some more time. Even
though you run the risk of the coach’s withdrawing the offer, you’ll
at least know you won’t be making a rushed decision. (Chances are
that if this is your situation, you have other offers on the table,
which is why the decision may not be an easy one.)
If you don’t commit, will someone
else get your slot?
Recruiting is often a game that involves sales and timing. If a coach
is recruiting more than one person at the position you play, your
slot may be taken by someone else who commits before you.
A volleyball coach may need only one setter for her team, but she
may be recruiting four girls she thinks can play that position. More
often than not, the coach will meet with each recruit separately,
letting each one know that there are four girls being recruited for
the setter position and that whichever one commits first is the one
the coach will go with. When that commitment has been made, the
other three will no longer be recruited.
This strategy is also a risk for the coach. If one of the girls com-
mits, and the coach stops recruiting the other three, what happens
if the committed recruit changes her mind? The three whom the
coach stopped recruiting may have already committed or signed
with other schools, and the coach may be back to square one.
This is why the recruiting process is sometimes compared to the
game of chess, with the coach and recruit trying to determine what
the other is thinking or what the next move will be.
If the school sends you a National Letter of Intent and/or a finan-
cial-aid agreement, you’re guaranteed a scholarship (even if you
sign it on the very last permissible day to sign), regardless of how
many others have signed ahead of you. The school’s athletic direc-
tor is responsible for making sure that the program does not
exceed the overall financial-aid limits for that sport.
Part IV: Committing to a School 
206

You’ll be asked to make many decisions, and knowing which option
is best is difficult. But this is why you have to do your research. You
have to know where you want to go to school and, most important,
why. When you know that you want to go to medical school and
that playing with State U. will make this possible, or that you want
a degree in business and your chance to play in the big leagues,
you can be more comfortable about your future. You’re not going
to a specific college just because someone else wants you to or
because you like its colors. You have a plan. You foresee a future.
With that said, why wait? Signing your National Letter of Intent or
financial-aid agreement is your best way of ensuring a scholarship.
This is your contract. Go for it!

Making the Verbal
Commitment
In This Chapter
 Understanding the offer: When a recruiter asks for a commitment
 Making and taking notes
 Discerning between fantasy and reality: Promises made
 Getting ready to sign on
N
ot all student-athletes are asked to make a verbal commit-
ment. Sometimes, the process moves so quickly that there is
no time for a verbal commitment. It may be that the next thing you
know, you’re signing on the dotted line. Others make a verbal com-
mitment to more than one school. It happens — and there’s noth-
ing improper about that.
Because a verbal commitment is just that — verbal — there is no
binding contract between you and the institution. Such verbal
agreements are more common in football and basketball, but they
may occur for athletes in any sport. For that reason alone, you
need to understand what verbal commitments are about and how
you should handle them. In this chapter, we fill you in.
The Big Decision: Making 
Your Choice
What are your long-term goals? In Chapters 10 and 11, we show
you the importance of researching schools to determine which is
the best one for you. In the middle of this process, many of your
goals, and even decisions that you thought you had already made,
may change when you’re face to face with a recruiter. Suddenly,
here is a person who is excited about you and what you have to
offer her program.

Recruiting college athletes is a business. Recruiters and coaches
are excited about you as an athlete, not so much as a person. They
aren’t happy for you because you’re a swell guy or gal, or because
you worked so hard and deserve this great opportunity. In reality,
you represent a better future for their sports program. You prom-
ise new strength or talent. Although you may have a clear idea of
where you want to be in four years, the recruiter’s enthusiasm and
finely tuned sales pitch can suddenly alter everything.
For this reason, before that recruiter arrives at your door, get out
the old pen and paper again, and create a list of questions you need
to answer for yourself — this list will prepare you for the surprise
offer that may lie ahead. Remember: To answer these questions
fully, you’ll need to discuss them with your family, friends, and
coaches.
Think of yourself as an incoming freshman student-athlete at
College X, and ask yourself the following questions:
 How prepared are you for college academics? Will the
demands at College X, with its reputation for academic excel-
lence, be too much? Would you fit in better at a less demand-
ing college?
 Are you really ready to play college sports in light of the
added pressure of a scholarship, demanding coaches, and
the need to make the minimum grades to remain eligible?
 Are you able to compare College X to other colleges? If not,
you need to do some more homework.
 When you’re able to compare College X to other schools,
have you assessed the sports and academic records of each
school on your short list? Have you tried to identify the
school that offers you the best balance given your academic
record and commitment to your sport?
 Is it time to look again at your short list? Maybe you need to
investigate other schools in search of the best academic and
athletic balance. Have you considered creating a second-
choice list?
 Have you considered your financial position? No matter
how attractive College X may be, it has to be affordable.
Remember: Not everyone gets a full ride — you may receive
only a partial scholarship. Will a partial scholarship work with
your available resources?
 Looking beyond graduation, does College X offer you a
clear path toward what you want? Do you hope to play pro
ball? Do you want to pursue a particular profession? How will
College X help you achieve your goals, whatever they are?
Part IV: Committing to a School 
210

Answering these questions will give you a better idea of where you
hope to be in the three, four, or five years ahead, when you gradu-
ate. With a carefully designed plan for what you want, you’ll have
confidence when talking one on one with a recruiter.
Getting advice
Before a decision-making meeting with a recruiter, supplement
what you know about College X and other schools on your list with
information from those who have been in your shoes, especially
athletes you know from playing your sport. You’ll get your best
information from athletes who know you on the field, on the court,
or in the pool.
While you were making your official visits, you asked about the
positives and negatives of each school. But you can’t realistically
expect the host (athlete) to dish out the dirt. A better strategy is to
talk to alumni or to find a potential teammate during the off season
to ask questions about the program.
Perhaps the best question-and-answer we’ve heard came from a
top, nationally ranked track-and-field athlete, whom we’ll call Joe.
Joe began asking other track athletes about a smaller Division II
school. He asked them, “What if the program was dropped? Would
you still want to come to this school?” They told Joe, “No way.”
They didn’t like the geographic location and weren’t that inter-
ested in the school itself (because of its traditions and academic
reputation). With that in mind, Joe refocused his search.
Chapter 14: Making the Verbal Commitment 211
Can I commit to more than one school?
Because the verbal commitment isn’t binding, you can commit to one, five, even ten
schools. But what is the fallout from this strategy? Although you may be thinking
you don’t want to rule out any school, is it okay to say yes to so many? Technically,
yes, you can — but coaches talk, and if you commit to more than one school, the
coaches may not trust you.
Be forthright with coaches. Remember: This is their profession. You want and need
coaches to speak openly and honestly with you. And you should do the same with
them in return.

Reviewing your notes
Recruiting is business. Let there be no mistake: Providing scholar-
ships and making dollars work is serious business in college ath-
letic departments. Looking for evidence? The hiring and firing of
coaches based on personal performance, recruiting, and success
are business decisions. So, in your decision-making process, you
should think like a business major. Whether you plan to major in
physical education, liberal arts, or engineering, you need a busi-
ness plan for yourself.
By answering the questions you developed earlier in this chapter,
you automatically began creating a “business plan.” When you ini-
tialize the first stage of your “business plan” (by selecting the
school you hope to attend based on the information you’ve gath-
ered), you can feel more confident about the path to and beyond
graduation.
The business plan requires information that you’ve gathered about
those colleges that meet your academic interests and that have a
strong program in your sport. You’ve also factored in your criteria
for geographic and social considerations. Finally, you’ve researched
their scholarship offers, and you can reasonably believe that these
colleges will be willing to work with you.
You’ve also acquired essential information about the process of
being recruited from those who went before you. There shouldn’t
be any surprises in terms of how the recruiter will do his business.
You can game it out: He says this, and I say that.
So, you know what you want. But you need a plan that will let you
achieve your goals. The best way to carry out your plan is to have a
specific list of items to be discussed with a recruiter, who may be a
coach:
 Ask about the recruiting statistics for the recruiter/coach talk-
ing to you.
 Ask about the success of the coach’s current and past teams.
 Be ready and willing to discuss scholarship options.
 What can you learn from the recruiter about the coaching
staff’s view of the school’s academic standards? Are there
tutors to assist athletes who need extra help?
 Do the athletes on the team you may join generally manage to
maintain eligibility?
 How committed is the coach to giving and getting you a 
scholarship?
Part IV: Committing to a School 
212

Although this strategy will help you stay on course as you, the
coach, and your parents discuss your possible future in college,
any promises made are not guarantees! There is nothing legally
binding about what you’re discussing.
Now it’s time to put the plan into effect. Using 3-x-5-inch index
cards, write out all your questions, and number them. No matter
how silly or insignificant they may seem, if you wondered about
something that the recruiter should be able to answer, put it on a
card to make sure you remember to ask about it.
Have a backup plan — a Plan B. What is the backup plan? It’s your
insurance policy. Recruiters will sometimes overpromise regarding
scholarships, and it may turn out that the school they represent
will not fulfill their promises. In reality, sometimes even a gifted
athlete with a strong academic record has a scholarship offer
pulled out from under him for reasons that are beyond his control.
That’s where the backup plan becomes essential. Yes, you’re
excited about meeting a recruiter to discuss a verbal commitment,
but you remember that this is not a binding contract. Therefore,
you’re more comfortable because your Plan B has a list with two or
three other attractive schools on it.
Recognizing that not all 
that glitters is gold
One of the key elements of your business plan is marketing you,
which requires that you maintain communication with the key
players. In particular, you must respond to phone calls, e-mails, or
letters from the academic and/or athletic side of the school in
which you’re interested. Don’t put off responding if there is a ques-
tion about your commitment or your potential spot on the team.
According to the former NAIA athletic director of Northwood
College, Shawn Winget, prospects often take the recruiting process
for granted. In early 2000, Winget recruited a young talent, offering
a scholarship. What happened next was unfortunate and unavoid-
able. “Sometimes, there are cutbacks. I hadn’t talked to the kid in
six months, and then all of a sudden he calls. I said, ‘Who? Eric?
Oh, yeah . . . but that was in December. This is June!’” There had
been a change in the available funding, and Winget had to call the
prospect’s father to explain that there was no longer a scholarship
offer on the table.
In other cases, there is no gold at all. Overly aggressive recruiters
may simply offer something that does not exist. Sadly, not all
coaches are completely honest about scholarship money. Although
the NCAA, NAIA, and NJCAA do their best to watch out for this
Chapter 14: Making the Verbal Commitment 213

kind of behavior, honesty is not the only policy in the recruiting
game.
Fortunately, most recruiters are honest and have the best of inten-
tions for the prospect and their families. But even with the best of
intentions, a deal can go sour. For example, a head coach in track
and field knows that she has three scholarships to offer. She also
knows that just because she makes an offer to a student-athlete, it
doesn’t mean the athlete will accept. Therefore, a more-aggressive
coach may offer those three scholarships to as many as six ath-
letes, knowing she won’t get every one of them. But what happens
when that same coach strikes gold, and all six athletes accept?
Someone — maybe you — loses out.
Every year, the NCAA and NAIA investigate claims by disgruntled
parents and athletes who claim to have been misled by a recruiter
or coach regarding a scholarship — and, indeed, many have. So,
how can you protect yourself in all this?
Do your homework. Research the recruiter or coach who is looking
at you. Understand his previous record, talk to former athletes,
and get whatever you can in writing. When you’ve decided on the
college you want to attend, notify the school right away — and
remember, it’s not a deal until a scholarship agreement is signed
(see Chapter 15).
Going with your gut
Let’s talk business strategy again: You’ve done everything we’ve
covered to this point in the chapter. You’ve made the lists, done
the comparisons, thought hard about what you want to do after
graduation, and you’re ready to meet the recruiter.
So, the rest of the decision-making process will be a snap, right?
Well, maybe and maybe not. You can strategize and strategize, but
eventually you’ll have to do something about it.
The trick is to stick with your plan, including using those 3-x-5-inch
cards.
As we spoke to athletes and parents, we asked about their number-
one regret, if they had one, following their face-to-face meetings
with a recruiter. They said that, even though they had more ques-
tions for the recruiter, they were afraid to ask because:
 They didn’t want to appear stupid or uneducated.
 They didn’t want to monopolize the recruiter’s time.
Part IV: Committing to a School 
214

 They didn’t want to admit they didn’t fully understand the
process.
Instead, they thought they would figure it out later. Most often,
they reported, they didn’t — at least not until it was too late.
When you meet with a recruiter or coach, this is your time to clar-
ify concerns, dispel myths, confirm information, and educate your-
self about the entire process. Rely on your gut feeling. If this isn’t a
person you feel comfortable talking to, perhaps this is your clue
that you need to find another school.
In particular, if you’re talking with a coach from your potential
team, you need to feel good about her. You don’t want to tie your
athletic — and to some degree your academic — future to some-
one you’re not comfortable with. Trust your gut!
Of course, we aren’t saying that a coach has to be perfect. Here are
some tips to help you make a judgment:
 Coaches should be professional and knowledgeable. This
doesn’t mean, however, that they have to know everything. If
you ask a question that a coach is unable to answer, this can
be a good thing. How quickly and earnestly your coach or
recruiter tries to find an answer for your question speaks vol-
umes. She should go that extra mile and do whatever it takes
to answer your questions and meet your needs.
 Coaches should be good communicators. You don’t need a
fast-talking coach who leaves you with more questions than
answers. What you do need is a coach or recruiter who can
and will take the time to outline what she wants of you and
where she sees you on the field and with the team (both short
and long term).
 Trustworthiness and caring are critical qualities. Your
potential coach should leave you with the feeling that this is a
person you can later talk to about any problems. Ask yourself,
“Will I want to talk to this person about something that’s
highly personal and that’s affecting my ability on the field?”
The Tough Calls: Phoning Your
Second and Third Choices
Congratulations! You’ve made your choice, and you’re ready to
make the verbal commitment. Now you need to inform the other
schools that you’ve indicated strong interest in another college.
Chapter 14: Making the Verbal Commitment 215

You don’t have to tell them before verbally committing to your first
choice, but keep in mind that the word will get to them pretty
quickly. You want to tell them before you commit to your number-
one school. By doing this, you show respect and give the other
coaches time to reevaluate their own recruiting processes. You
also earn respect for yourself as a thoughtful athlete.
Let’s face it: No one looks forward to saying, “I’ve thought about it,
and you’re not my first choice.” That’s true whether we’re talking
about a date to the senior prom or choosing a college. Still, it needs
to be done, and your grandmother was right: Honesty is the best
policy.
So, what do you say? Try to cover the following points (if they
relate to you):
 I’m calling to tell you that, after a lot of thought, I’ve decided
to accept an offer from College X.
 I really appreciate the time you’ve given me. I had a hard time
choosing between your program and the one at College X.
 I would happily recommend your program to any of my 
teammates — it’s a great one. The offer from College X just fit
really well with my needs.
 If the situation changes for some reason, I hope that you’ll still
consider me for your program.
The last point is especially important, because things can change.
Your second and third choices were likely part of your Plan B, and
it’s in your best interest to leave open the possibility that you’ll
come back to them. You never know what may happen at College X
down the road. . . .
Your reputation as a reliable straight-shooter will be important for
the rest of your life. How you handle a difficult task such as making
these phone calls is likely to become an important part of your
reputation.
Your Last Call: Making the 
Verbal Commitment
You’re assuming that saying “yes” to your first choice will be an easy
call. Not always. It depends on various factors, including how much
College X wants you, how much attention your decision-making
Part IV: Committing to a School 
216

process is getting, and the desires of your new coach. If the recruit-
ing process has been low key, you may only need to call the coach
to say, “Thanks for your offer. I accept!”
For the majority of athletes, a local paper will be the only news
outlet running the story — after the fact — when the announce-
ment of your college choice is made. In many ways, this is a good
thing. It relieves you of the added pressure from family, friends,
coaches, and perhaps the general public that comes with making
the “right” decision about exactly the “right” college and program.
On the other hand, if for any reason your decision is a big deal, you
may decide to have your parents, a coach, or a recruiting service
announce your decision. Whoever makes the call, it should be
courteous. Assuming that you’ve already told your second and
third choices of your decision, you’ll want to acknowledge the
other great schools and programs you looked at, whether you
name them or not, and make the point that it was a hard choice to
make. Needless to say, you also want to be humble in commenting
on the contributions that you’ll make to the team: “This is a great
team, and I just hope that I’ll be able to help the program.”
Again, remember that a verbal commitment is simply a verbal com-
mitment. There is no obligation to let other schools know (although
we recommend that you do), just as schools may continue to
recruit you. Not until you’ve signed the National Letter of Intent
must coaches stop communicating with you (according to NCAA
guidelines).
Whether yours is high profile or a private family affair, it’s an excit-
ing opportunity that few get a chance to experience. By communi-
cating openly and honestly with everyone, you respect the entire
process.
Planning the Next Steps
You’ve probably seen TV coverage of some hot new prospect
making the announcement in front of a room full of reporters,
coaches, and family. “I choose . . .” and the athlete dons a cap with
his choice’s logo, underlining his intention. Hurray! There is a gasp,
applause, and a burst of flashes as photographers record the
moment. The work is done, right? Baseball legend Yogi Berra’s
comment that “It ain’t over ’til it’s over” is worth remembering.
In reality, the verbal commitment is just a gesture of good faith.
Not until you sign on the dotted line does the commitment become
official. Before you sign, you still have the opportunity to look at
Chapter 14: Making the Verbal Commitment 217

other schools, review your offers, and revisit the checklist we
cover earlier. (If you decide to actually visit other schools that
interest you, turn to Chapter 10 for more on the rules for visiting
schools.)
Keep your “business plan” close by. Continue reviewing your
options, focusing especially on the Plan B schools that you’ve iden-
tified. Discussions with your trusted advisors, family, friends, high
school coaching staff, and others can be helpful in various ways —
for example, helping you get through the waiting.
Also seek their advice on your Plan B thinking. For all you know,
your thinking about your career objectives may change, and you
may decide you actually prefer another school, whether for the
academics or the athletics.
At the same time, you need to stay in touch with College X while their
decision-making continues. You don’t want them to assume that,
because they haven’t heard from you, you aren’t really interested.

Letter of Intent

O
ver the past decade, the first Wednesday in February has
almost become a national holiday. In certain parts of the
country (the Southeast, for example), this notion may not be too
far from the truth. For many, this day calls for a celebration, invit-
ing family, friends, and the press.
So, what is this day? The first Wednesday in February each year is
the national signing day for college football. Internet traffic on that
day can be compared to major gridlock in Los Angeles because of
all the college-football fans scouring the Web to see who signed
with their favorite schools and if their local high school stud
decided to play close to home or take his talents to a university
across the country.
The National Letter of Intent (NLI) is, as they say, big doings around
the nation. But what is it? Exactly what is the purpose of this sign-
ing, and how will it benefit you? In this chapter, we fill you in.
What Is a National Letter 
of Intent?
The National Letter of Intent (NLI) is a commitment between you
(the prospective student-athlete) and a collegiate institution. An
NLI is not issued to a prospect without a scholarship. An individual

who has been invited to walk on to a team, but who has not been
offered an athletic scholarship, is not permitted to sign an NLI.
The point of the NLI is to bring assurance to the recruiting process.
Even though the nuances of the NLI can be complex, its premise
isn’t that complicated. If you’re admitted to a school, and eligible
for financial aid and competition per NCAA rules, the school agrees
to award you an athletic scholarship for one full academic year. In
return, you (the prospect) agree to attend that school for no less
than one full academic year.
Some coaches allow a prospect to sign an NLI without an athletic
scholarship and then the coach doesn’t file the NLI with the proper
authority (usually the conference office) because the NLI is invalid.
Why? Because many student-athletes think of the NLI as a presti-
gious thing — and the coaches don’t want their nonscholarship
athletes to feel slighted. If you don’t have a scholarship, and the
coach asks you for your NLI, it’s just for show — you can sign it or
not, whichever you prefer.
Understanding the fine print
The NLI is not associated with the NCAA. It is a form that was cre-
ated by the Collegiate Commissioners Association as a protection
for the universities.
Just as the athletic scholarship you sign is your protection that the
school must offer you the scholarship for the specified period of
time (not for more than one academic year), the NLI is the school’s
protection that you’ll attend that particular institution for at least
one full academic year.
NCAA rules do not permit schools to offer athletic scholarships for
more than one academic year. However, that scholarship can be
renewed each year for no more than five years.
After you’ve signed an NLI with a particular school, other colleges
and universities that participate in the program are no longer per-
mitted to recruit you. Likewise, you’re no longer subjected to
recruiting phone calls and contacts, and you aren’t allowed to
make any more official visits.
The NLI program is voluntary for schools — however, more than 500
Division I and Division II colleges and universities participate in the
program. The Ivy League, the National Service Academies (Air Force,
Army, and Navy), and some of the schools in the Patriot League are
Division I schools that do not subscribe to the NLI. No Division III
schools, NAIA institutions, or junior colleges participate in the NLI
Part IV: Committing to a School 
220

program. You can find a complete list of NLI member schools and
conferences on the NLI Web site (www.national-letter.org).
If you’re under the age of 21, your parent or legal guardian is
required to cosign the NLI with you. This rule applies even if you
don’t currently live with your parent or legal guardian.
What if your parent or legal guardian lives in a different location
from you? Not to worry. You can get the signatures by faxing the
NLI to your parent or legal guardian and have him or her fax it back
to you. Be sure to make three copies, and send all three to your
parent or legal guardian. When all three copies have been signed,
you should keep one for your records and send the other two back
to the school. The institution is responsible for forwarding at least
one copy to the conference office.
The NLI is a binding document. Before you sign it, make sure that
attending this school on this scholarship is what you want. By this
time, you and your family should have made a long list of pros and
cons. You should have discussed all your options and feel strongly
about the school you’re going to attend before signing on the
dotted line.
If you do sign a NLI, you can meet the obligations of it in one of 
two ways:
 Attend the institution with which you signed for at least one
full academic year.
 Graduate from a junior college if you signed an NLI during
your senior year in high school or during your first year of
junior college, as long as it is not the year you are sched-
uled to graduate. What that means is if you sign an NLI during
your senior year in high school or during your first year of
junior college, you can attend a different college that partici-
pates in the NLI program without penalties if you graduate
from a junior college first.
You are not required to sign an NLI in order to receive a scholar-
ship. However, most coaches will want you to sign one because the
NLI binds you to the school for at least one full academic year. Don’t
sign just because you think this is something you have to do — if
signing an NLI doesn’t feel right to you, don’t do it.
Although you may have a verbal offer from and/or make a verbal
commitment to a school, verbal agreements are not legally bind-
ing, and they’re often broken — both by the schools and by the
athletes — prior to the actual NLI signing process.
Chapter 15: Understanding the National Letter of Intent 221

In most sports, when a verbal commitment has been made by 
the prospect, coaches from other schools may no longer recruit
the prospect — this is very common in volleyball and soccer. High-
profile sports such as football and men’s and women’s basketball,
however, usually have a slightly different philosophy. When a
prospect makes a verbal commitment in those sports, other
schools increase their recruiting efforts and try to persuade the
athlete to change his mind.
You are not permitted to sign a second NLI if you decide to transfer
from one four-year school to another. You are permitted to sign
only one NLI during your athletic career, and if you decide to trans-
fer to another school, you would be permitted to sign only a finan-
cial-aid agreement with the second institution.
Knowing what you’re committing to
The NLI is a legally binding document, and as soon as you sign one,
other schools are not permitted to recruit you. For many athletes,
signing an NLI is a relief — it means no more phone calls, letters, or
heavy recruiting from other universities. And no more agonizing
over which college to attend — the decision is made.
You are signing the NLI with an institution, not a specific coach or
athletics program. If the coach leaves, you are not released from
your obligation. Many times, a student-athlete who is excited about
training and playing under a specific coach learns only after he or
Part IV: Committing to a School 
222
Letters of intent outside the NCAA
What if you sign a letter of intent with a junior college or an NAIA school? Only
NCAA Division I and II schools are members of the NLI program, so you can sign an
NLI with a Division I or Division II school even you previously signed a letter of intent
with a junior college or NAIA institution.
There is not a national letter of intent program for the NAIA; each school determines
its requirements if it chooses to have a letter of intent. The NJCAA does have a letter
of intent program and its requirements and penalties are similar to the NLI program.
You can find a sample NJCAA letter of intent and scholarship agreement form at
the following Web site: www.njcaa.org/njcaaforms/050823_4_Letter
ofIntent%20Compressed.pdf.
If you do sign a letter of intent with either an NAIA school or a junior college, make
sure you understand the differences between these letters and the NLI program
before you sign more than one letter.

she has signed an NLI that the coach will be leaving the institution
for greener pastures (or fields). The document is binding, and you
will be expected to attend that school for at least one year, regard-
less of the coaching staff.
Failure to meet your obligation to the NLI could result in severe eli-
gibility penalties if you want to transfer to another NLI school. See
the nearby sidebar “A deal is a deal” for a real-life example.
Where do you turn if you have questions about the NLI? The answer
is the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The SEC handles the daily
administrative duties of the National Letter of Intent program on
behalf of the Collegiate Commissioners Association. The phone
number at the SEC is 205-458-3000, but the NLI Web site
(www.national-letter.org) is the best place to start.
Chapter 15: Understanding the National Letter of Intent 223
A deal is a deal
In November 2002, four highly recruited prospects all signed National Letters of
Intent to play basketball at the University of Kansas starting in the fall of 2003. In
April 2003, however, the longtime, successful head coach at Kansas decided to
leave the school and become the head coach at his alma mater, the University of
North Carolina.
All four of the recruits were shocked by the coach’s departure, and three readily
admitted that their main reason for choosing to sign with Kansas was the opportu-
nity to play for the now-departed coach. Because the four had signed NLIs, they
were obligated to attend Kansas for one full year. Their other options were to attend
a junior college and then transfer to another Division I school or request a mutual
release agreement from Kansas.
Three of the four were named to at least one high school All-American team, and
all four were star players who could have chosen to attend a number of schools,
so Kansas was reluctant to grant any relief from the NLIs that they signed. All four
eventually attended Kansas for the 2003–2004 academic year, and all played on the
basketball team.
After the 2003–2004 year, one transferred to the University of Louisville, while
another transferred to the University of California at Berkeley. Both were required
to sit out during the 2004–2005 season according to NCAA transfer rules and are
eligible to play in 2005–2006. The remaining two stayed at Kansas during the
2004–2005 season, but only one is left now — the other recently transferred to the
University of New Mexico and will have to sit out until the 2006–2007 season.
What would have happened if those basketball players decided not to attend
Kansas and wanted to go to another school that participates in the NLI program?

Knowing When and Where to Sign
Because the NLI is based on recruiting, the NCAA does have some
rules regarding when it can be signed, and those rules vary
depending on your sport. In the following sections, we help you
navigate these waters in a way that works for you.
Deciding whether to sign early
Your coach may encourage you to sign your NLI early, during
what’s called the early signing period. In fact, athletic programs
commonly offer and spend most of their available scholarship
money during the early signing period. For example, if a basketball
program has five scholarships available, more often than not, at
least four of those will be offered and usually accepted during the
early signing period.
If a coach hasn’t received commitments from the prospects he
wants the most, the coach may opt to save a spot (or a few spots)
rather than offer it to a player he thinks may not be as good. More
spots often open after the early signing period because players
already on the team become ineligible, quit, or redshirt.
Part IV: Committing to a School 
224
They would have lost one year of eligibility and would have been required to serve
a year of residence (sit out one year) at the second school. The same penalties
would apply if they didn’t fulfill the terms of the NLI completely (for example, they
didn’t attend the school with which they signed for at least one full year).
Of course, there are extenuating circumstances or situations beyond your control
that may force you to not meet the obligations of the NLI. These could range from
family emergencies to financial hardships. If you’re unable to fulfill the terms of the
NLI, the penalty can be waived or reduced by sending a Release Request Form to
the athletic director at the school where you signed the NLI, requesting a complete
release. If this request is denied, and you don’t receive a complete release from the
NLI, you may appeal to the NLI Steering Committee. The Steering Committee has
the ability to grant a complete or partial release from the NLI.
You have other options if you choose not to attend the school at which you signed
a NLI. You can attend any other school that does not participate in the NLI program
(for example, an NAIA school or a junior college) without incurring any of the penal-
ties we mention earlier. However, if you ever transfer to another school that does
participate in the NLI program, the penalties will be applied at that point unless you
received a waiver.
(continued)

If the sport you play has an early signing period, there are advan-
tages and disadvantages to signing at this time.
The advantages to signing early
The biggest advantage: After you sign the NLI, the recruiting process
is over. You’ve made up your mind, and you’ve been guaranteed a
scholarship for the next year at your college. You’re now free to
focus on your final year of high school (or junior college). If for some
reason you haven’t met the eligibility standards, you can concen-
trate on that so you don’t lose the opportunity you just received.
Another advantage to signing early may come if you’ve had a less-
than-stellar season. The senior slump can hit hard, causing your
usually excellent performance on the field or court to lag. What
with the pressure of school, scholarships, the recruiting process,
and family, it’s a wonder you can even play. Many student-athletes
are relieved to know that, despite a so-so season, their scholarship
is safe after they’ve signed the NLI. Your college coach may not
revoke a scholarship offer simply because you didn’t have a great
senior season.
The disadvantages to signing early
Signing early is a disadvantage if you aren’t ready to make a com-
mitment. Numerous student-athletes have signed an NLI with a
school because they didn’t think they would have another oppor-
tunity or simply wanted to end the recruiting process. After a great
senior year, however, several bigger or more prominent schools
started showing interest — but because the athletes had already
signed the NLI, they were locked in. They couldn’t be recruited by
other schools.
If you’ve already signed an NLI, and you’re still being recruited, the
right thing for you to do is tell the recruiters that you’ve already
signed an NLI. Trying to back out of a signed NLI could cost you at
least one season of competition and force you to serve a year in
residence at another school.
Signing an NLI during the early signing period can be a gamble, so
make sure you’re 100 percent sure that you’re making the right
decision before you sign your name on that dotted line.
Knowing the signing date 
for your sport
Table 15-1 outlines the signing dates for the 2006–2007 recruiting
class. The dates change every year, but they’re usually close to
Chapter 15: Understanding the National Letter of Intent 225

these dates. (Check the NLI Web site at www.national-letter.
org or call 205-458-3000 to find out what the dates are for the year
you’ll be starting.)
NLIs must be signed after 7 a.m. (local time) on the initial signing
date or any time prior to the final signing date.
In Table 15-1, the early period is a week-long period in November that
allows you to sign an NLI, while the late period is a longer period of
time in the spring when it is permissible to sign the NLI. The sports
that do not have an early signing period have a regular period, and
this period is the only time it is permissible to sign an NLI.

Setting up a signing location
The signing of the NLI can be as private or public as you want it to
be. You can sign in your own home or in a public setting.
If you want to set up your own press conference to announce your
signing of an NLI, remember that your future college coach (or a
Part IV: Committing to a School 
226

booster from that university) is not allowed to be present for this
press conference. In addition, the college is not allowed to give you
or let you borrow any apparel for the announcement. If you and/or
your parents want to sport the colors of the school of your choice,
you must buy those items in the same way that the general public
would get them.
You may work with your club or high school coach to arrange the
press conference. Again, this setting can be as formal (renting a
banquet hall at a local hotel) or informal (sitting at a table in your
school’s gymnasium) as you see fit. You may want to make this
your chance to pay tribute to all the coaches, teammates, and
family members who helped and supported you.
After you’ve determined a time, place, and location, you need to
create a press release to send to the media in your area. A press
release is generally a one-page letter stating your name, the school
you’ve been attending, and your athletic statistics. If the local
press has been following your high school athletic career, they’ll
most likely know all they need to know about your highlights —
but don’t be shy about listing your stats. To have a strong press
conference, you need to generate interest — but keep the informa-
tion to one page.
It never hurts to invite as many friends and family as you can to
cheer you on as you announce your commitment and sign the
National Letter of Intent. Remember: The camera loves a good
crowd.
If you’re a big-time, blue-chip prospect, members of the media will
generally already have asked you or your parents what time and
where you will sign the NLI, so asking them to cover the signing is
not an issue.
If you’re less prominent, or you don’t play a major sport, have your
high school coach or athletic director contact the local media. The
media generally takes these requests more seriously than they do
similar requests from parents. Having a representative from your
high school call the media won’t guarantee that they’ll show up to
cover the event, but it never hurts to ask. Who knows? You may be
more popular than you thought!
Some student-athletes choose to have a quiet ceremony in their
home with little fanfare. If this is more your style, you can still take
the opportunity to thank family, friends, coaches, and teammates.
Chapter 15: Understanding the National Letter of Intent 227

Knowing who needs to be 
present at the signing
For an NLI signing, most student-athletes have their parents and
other members of their family (sister, brother, grandparents), high
school coach and/or athletic director, friends, and teammates at
the signing. Who you invite is your choice, but for most student-
athletes, the NLI signing is a momentous occasion, one they want
to share with those who are closest to them.
The NLI signing is not the place for your new coach or recruiting
staff. You’ll see them soon enough — and the rules don’t allow
them to be present.

Maintaining Your Eligibility
In This Chapter
 Keeping up your grades and maintaining your amateur status
 Holding on to your scholarship when you’re injured or pregnant
 Fighting for your rights
A
fter you’ve earned an athletic scholarship for college, your
work is not over. In fact, it’s just begun: There are plenty of
rules about maintaining your academic and athletic eligibility, and
you have to know those rules and abide by them. You also need to
know your rights in case you’re sick, injured, or pregnant and your
collegiate athletic career is interrupted. Knowing whom to turn to
and what to do could save you not only your scholarship, but also
your eligibility. In this chapter, we give you the information you need.
Keeping Your Scholarship
In order to keep your scholarship, you must
 Maintain your academic eligibility by progressing toward a
bachelor’s or equivalent degree as determined by your school
 Maintain your amateur status as defined by the division or
association for which you compete
If you’re eligible, you’re qualified and in compliance with all 
NCAA, NAIA, or NJCAA requirements to compete in intercollegiate
athletics — and if you’re not eligible, you can’t compete.
You’re responsible for establishing and maintaining your eligibility —
nobody else will do this or watch out for this on your behalf. To be
eligible to practice and compete, you must comply with all the appli-
cable provisions of NCAA, NAIA, or NJCAA legislation (whichever
association you belong to) and follow the rules and regulations of
your institution and conference. We cover those basic standards in
the following sections.

Maintaining your academic 
eligibility
Each year you progress through college, the standards for compli-
ance or maintaining eligibility are somewhat different. Following
are breakdowns of those eligibility requirements by division or
association after the freshman year. (The requirements for your
freshman year — initial eligibility requirements — are listed in
Chapter 4.)
Rules and regulations change, and these rules are current as of this
writing. Always be sure to check the current regulations for your
school and your athletic association.
In NCAA Division I
For eligibility in NCAA Division I athletics, you must meet the fol-
lowing progress-toward-degree regulations:
 Sophomore year: To be eligible your sophomore year, you
must have successfully completed 24 semester (or 36 quarter)
hours of credit between the opening of classes in the fall of
your freshman year and the end of the summer session imme-
diately before your sophomore year. Of those 24 semester
hours, you must have completed 18 hours during the regular
academic year (fall and spring semesters). Therefore, you can
use only a maximum of 6 semester or 9 quarter hours of
summer school to meet the 24-hour requirement.
 Junior year: To be eligible your junior year, you must have
successfully completed 18 semester hours of credit between
the opening of classes in the fall of your sophomore year and
the end of the regular academic year (usually around May 
if you’re on the semester system or June if you’re on the quar-
ter system). By your fifth semester of enrollment (halfway
through your junior year) or seventh quarter (after the first
quarter of your junior year), you must declare a major and
have 40 percent of the course requirements for your degree
program completed.
Note: When we say “fifth semester” or “seventh quarter,”
we’re not talking about summer sessions — though any
coursework you do in your summer sessions obviously does
count toward that 40 percent number.
 Senior year: In order to be eligible your senior year, you must
have successfully completed 18 semester hours of credit
between the opening of classes in the fall of your junior year
and the end of the regular academic year (usually around May
Part V: When You’re in the Big Leagues 
232

if you’re on the semester system or June if you’re on the quar-
ter system). You must have must have 60 percent of the course
requirements for your degree program completed prior to the
beginning of your fourth year of enrollment, which is usually
your senior year. If you do go a fifth year, you have to have 80
percent completed prior to the start of that year.
 Fifth year: In order to be eligible your fifth year, you must
have successfully completed 18 semester hours of credit
between the opening of classes in the fall of your senior year
and the end of the regular academic year (usually around May
if you’re on the semester system or June if you’re on the quar-
ter system). You must have completed 80 percent of the
course requirements for your degree program prior to the
beginning of your fourth year of enrollment, which is usually
your senior year. If you do go a fifth year, you have to have 80
percent completed prior to the start of that year.
Note: You must successfully complete at least six semester hours
in the previous regular academic term of full-time enrollment to be
eligible to participate in the next regular academic term.
Included in these rules are minimum GPA requirements that place
you in good academic standing as established by the college
you’re attending. Most schools have a minimum GPA requirement
of 2.0 in order to graduate. By NCAA guidelines, you must have 90
percent of a 2.0 (1.8) by your second year, 95 percent (1.9) by your
third year, and 100 percent (2.0) by your fourth and fifth years.
Under NCAA regulations for Division I, you must complete four
years of playing eligibility within five consecutive years of your
first day of class. Division II and Division III student-athletes have
ten full-time semesters to finish four years of eligibility (these do
not have to be completed consecutively, as in Division I). (Medical-
hardship waivers and pregnancy exceptions may apply to Division
I, II, and III student-athletes for an extra year of competition. See
“The rights of the student-athlete,” later in this chapter, and also
refer to Chapter 17.)
A waiver of the minimum full-time enrollment requirement may be
granted if you’re enrolled in the final term of your bachelor’s
degree program. Also, you may represent the institution while
enrolled as a graduate or professional student or while enrolled
and seeking a second bachelor’s degree at the same institution.
In NCAA Division III
For eligibility in NCAA Division III athletics, you must meet the fol-
lowing three requirements:
Chapter 16: Maintaining Your Eligibility 233

 Make satisfactory academic progress toward a recognized
degree
 Be enrolled as a full-time student (taking an average of at least
12 credit hours per semester)
 Be in good academic standing (maintaining a minimum grade
point average of 2.0 or however “good academic standing” is
defined by your school)
NCAA Division III rules state that you have ten full-time semesters
to finish four years of eligibility. (You may be granted an extra year
of competition if you’re ill, injured, or pregnant and meet the NCAA’s
criteria for a medical hardship— see “The rights of the student-
athlete,” later in this chapter.)
In NAIA colleges
For eligibility in NAIA schools, you must fulfill the following
requirements:
 Be enrolled as a full-time student (taking at least 12 credit
hours per semester or 9 credit hours per quarter).
 Be certified as eligible in the spring based on the previous
spring and fall terms. For example, a baseball player may not
be eligible at the beginning of the fall 2006 term if he did not
complete 24 hours between the fall 2005 and spring 2006
terms. However, he may be eligible at the start of the spring
2007 season if he passed 24 hours during the spring 2006 and
fall 2006 terms.
 Maintain a minimum GPA that places you in good academic
standing, as established by the school for all students who
are at an equivalent stage of progress toward a degree.
According to NAIA regulations, you must — upon reaching
junior academic standing as defined by your school — have a
cumulative grade point average of at least 2.000 on a 4.000
scale as certified by the institutional registrar.
 Complete competition in a sport within ten full-time semes-
ters. You may be granted an extra year of competition if
you’re ill, injured, or pregnant and meet the criteria of the
NAIA for a medical hardship (see “The rights of the student-
athlete” later in this chapter).
In NJCAA
To be eligible in NJCAA institutions, you must fulfill the following
requirements:
Part V: When You’re in the Big Leagues 
234

 Be enrolled as a full-time student (at least 12 credit hours per
semester)
 Maintain a GPA of at least 1.75 on a 4.00 scale during the first
semester or quarter and a GPA of 2.00 after that
 Have passed, prior to the second season of competition, a
minimum of 24 credit hours with at least a 2.00 GPA
Maintaining your amateur status
Although maintaining at least a minimum GPA and making satisfac-
tory progress toward a degree are essential for every college stu-
dent who plans to graduate, these requirements are not enough for
the student-athlete to maintain amateur status and remain athleti-
cally eligible to participate in intercollegiate sports. As you’ll soon
discover, as a student-athlete, you must abide by all kinds of regu-
lations in order to maintain your eligibility.
For example, you can represent a college or university in one sport
and play a different sport professionally (for money) as long as you
don’t receive financial aid from the university in the second sport.
If you’re no longer involved in professional athletics, you’re not
receiving any remuneration from a professional sports organiza-
tion, and you have no active contractual relationship with any 
professional athletics team, you can receive financial aid in a sport
in which you were formerly a pro. You cannot, however, represent
a university in one sport and play a different sport as an amateur
(for no money) if you receive any endorsements to pay for the
amateur sport training. (See the “NCAA versus USOC: Must 
athletes choose between college athletics and the Olympics?” 
sidebar.)
At the beginning of your first academic year and each subsequent
year, the NCAA requires you to sign two statements in order to par-
ticipate in intercollegiate athletics:
 NCAA Student-Athlete Statement (or Buckley Amendment):
By signing this statement, you agree to disclose information
related to:
• Eligibility
• Recruitment
• Financial aid
• Amateur status
Chapter 16: Maintaining Your Eligibility 235

• Previous positive drug tests
• Involvement in organized-gambling activities related to
intercollegiate or professional athletic competition
 NCAA Drug Testing Consent Form: By signing this form, you
consent to be tested for the use of drugs banned by the NCAA.
If you don’t complete and sign both of these forms, you won’t be
eligible to participate in practice and competition. (You must sign
the drug consent form prior to practice or competition in Division I
and Division II sports in which the association conducts year-
round drug testing, and prior to competition in all other sports in
Divisions I, II, and III.)
But these forms, and the accompanying required physical examina-
tion, are just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Following are NCAA
guidelines for maintaining amateur status.
Be sure to check with your head coach or athletic director regard-
ing any questions you have about eligibility and before making any
decisions regarding outside athletic participation. These guidelines
are current as of this writing, but like any rules, they’re subject to
change.
You cannot, within your sport:
 Accept payment or a promise of payment (in cash, prizes, or
travel) for participation in your sport.
 Enter into an agreement of any kind to compete in profes-
sional athletics. You cannot negotiate a verbal or written pro-
fessional contract.
 Request that your name be put on a draft list for profes-
sional sports, try out for a professional sports team, or con-
sent to a medical examination by a professional sports team
during the academic year, including all school vacations.
 Use your athletic skill for payment. You cannot be employed
on a “fee-for-lesson” basis.
 Play on any professional athletic team (under your own or
an assumed name).
 Have your athletically related financial aid determined by
anyone other than the university.
 Participate on teams other than those fielded by the institu-
tion you attend during the season. This includes exhibition
or tournament games.
Part V: When You’re in the Big Leagues 
236

You cannot, in any sport (including ones you don’t play for your
school):
 Agree to have your picture or name used to promote a com-
mercial product.
 Accept things such as gifts, meals, and loans of cars or
money from athletic interest groups or individuals in the
athletic program at the university.
 Be represented by an agent or organization, including a
coach or member of the athletic staff at your institution, to
market your athletic skills or reputation.
 Agree to be represented by an agent in the future. You may
not agree to be represented by an agent until after your eligi-
bility has already ended, including during your team’s post-
season competition.
 Receive any benefit not available to other students at the
university.
 Participate in a summer basketball league not approved by
the NCAA (if you’re a basketball player at your school).
 Play on a nondepartmental athletic team during the aca-
demic year without permission from your head coach and
faculty athletic representative.
 Knowingly take any banned substances. Don’t assume that
banned substances relate only to street drugs or perform-
ance-enhancing drugs. Banned substances also include pre-
scriptions and over-the-counter medications such as cold
medications and nutritional/diet supplements.
 Knowingly provide information to individuals involved in
organized-gambling activities concerning intercollegiate
athletic competition; solicit a bet on any intercollegiate or
professional team; accept a bet on any team representing
the institution; or participate in any gambling activity that
involves intercollegiate athletics or professional athletics,
through a bookmaker, parlay card, or any other method
employed by organized gambling. Remember: Gambling
includes nonmonetary material items that have tangible value.
 Retain professional services (legal advice) for personal rea-
sons at less than the normal charge.
You also cannot
 Receive special discounts, payment arrangements, or credit
on purchases (for example, airline tickets or clothing) or serv-
ices (for example, laundry, dry cleaning, or tailoring)
Chapter 16: Maintaining Your Eligibility 237

 Receive loans of money in any amount
 Receive guarantees of bond
 Receive the use of an automobile
 Receive a free meal or service at commercial establishments
 Receive free transportation to or from a summer job
 Receive a benefit connected with off-campus housing (for
example, individual TV sets or stereo equipment, specialized
recreational facilities, room furnishings, or appointments of
extra quality or quantity) that is not available on the same
basis in the housing provided to at least half of the other
members of the student body living in on-campus housing
 Sign or cosign a note with an outside agency to arrange a loan
 Sell or give a student-athlete ticket to athletic, university, or
town events
 Receive the use of someone else’s personal property (for
example, boats, summer homes, cars, or stereos)
 Make or bill long-distance telephone calls using college 
telephones
 Use copy machines or fax machines at no cost
 Have course papers typed at the athletic department’s
expense
Generally, the preceding restrictions apply to all divisions in all
three intercollegiate associations (NCAA, NAIA, and NJCAA).
Although NCAA Division III and NJCAA may not award athletic
scholarships, their students are still expected to uphold certain
ethical responsibilities. Additionally, individual schools, confer-
ences, and associations may have their own conduct requirements.
So be sure to check the academic and athletic requirements not
only for the association in which you compete, but also for the
conference, the division, and the individual institution.
For example, most institutions have policies restricting the use of
alcohol at university events, as well as the use of tobacco products
(including smokeless tobacco). All these institutions have policies
regarding class attendance. And all have policies requiring that
you not only adhere to the preceding restrictions, but also report
unethical or illegal behavior such as gambling or involvement in
violations of NCAA, NAIA, or NJCAA regulations.
Knowledge is your greatest tool. Know the rules.

Chapter 16: Maintaining Your Eligibility 239
NCAA versus USOC: Must athletes 
choose between college athletics 
and the Olympics?
Sometimes the eligibility rules for college athletes are hard to understand — not
because the language is complex, but because the logic is confusing.
Take Jeremy Bloom’s eligibility, for example. Jeremy was a standout wide receiver
(he still holds a school record with a 94-yard scoring reception) and punt returner
for the University of Colorado at Boulder. He was named both first-team Freshman
All-America and Big 12 Freshman All-Conference team for special teams in 2002
and second-team Big 12 All-Conference for special teams in 2003.
Bloom also is one of the world’s top moguls skiers. A member of the 2002 U.S.
Olympic ski team, he holds several World Cup championships in moguls skiing and
is, as of this writing, training as a member of the 2006 U.S. Olympic ski team.
The NCAA allows student-athletes to compete in and receive payment for profes-
sional sports other than their collegiate sports. (This rule has been used mostly by
several college football players who tried their hand and failed at professional —
Minor League — baseball and then returned to college football and their full 
scholarships.)
The NCAA does not allow athletes, however, to receive endorsement money for the
sports they play, which leaves amateur athletes, such as Olympic skiers like Bloom,
in a bind, because they receive no salaries from their amateur sports. Instead, they
rely on endorsements to pay for expensive training and travel costs (and coaches’,
trainers’, and physical therapists’ salaries).
The U.S. ski team, for example, pays only for in-season training; athletes have to
pay for the rest of the year’s training, for the costs of trainers and coaches, and for
travel and housing out of their own pockets. For competitive freestyle skiing, that
means at least $100,000 per year.
Before attending the University of Colorado, Bloom received endorsements to fund
his ski training. But under the NCAA’s strict rules to keep its players “amateur,”
Bloom couldn’t have both endorsements and a spot on the Buffaloes’ gridiron. The
NCAA also proclaimed that Bloom would have to give up the modeling and TV
careers he had been offered.
So that he could continue to play football for the UC Buffaloes, Bloom turned down
the endorsements for skiing, the modeling career, and the TV career. But, after
unsuccessfully lobbying Congress to allow some compensation for college athletes,
Bloom filed a lawsuit against the NCAA, seeking permission to keep his ski spon-
sorships. He argued that his endorsements were from skiing, not football; had
absolutely no impact on football; and were necessary to support his Olympic dream,
because skiers (like all amateur athletes) depend on endorsements and not salaries

Injury or Pregnancy?

as a source of income. He also argued that the NCAA’s rules on sponsorship are
unfair, considering that the NCAA itself makes hundreds of millions of dollars from
sponsorship endorsements, TV contracts, and apparel licensing (including the thou-
sands of UC shirts with Bloom’s number sold for profit, none of which went to Bloom).
In asking that an exception be made to the rule about amateur status or that the
rule be changed, Bloom also cited an example of the NCAA’s making exceptions to
its own rules. In 1999, Tim Dwight was allowed to retain his NCAA eligibility and
compete for the University of Iowa’s track team after paying back endorsement
money he received as a wide receiver for the NFL’s Atlanta Falcons in 1998. Another
recent example of the NCAA’s exceptions to its own rules is the organization’s deci-
sion in 2004 to waive the mandatory sit-out year for Division I transfers after a
number of Baylor men’s basketball players left for other universities after one of
their teammates was murdered and their coach tried to cover it up.
After forgoing two seasons’ worth of sponsorship money, Bloom announced in 2004
that he could no longer afford to pay for his ski training and that he would have to
accept endorsements. Also, in April 2004, the General Assembly of Colorado
appealed to the NCAA in a joint resolution “to review its rules that prohibit Jeremy
Bloom from successfully competing in both collegiate football and competitive skiing
and make changes or exceptions to these rules to allow for Jeremy Bloom to con-
tinue competing in both sports.” Bloom had shown he could excel in both sports, and
he was sure the NCAA would support him.
He was wrong.
Not only did the NCAA reject the Colorado General Assembly’s request, but in
August 2004, a judge also ruled against Bloom. The rationale in both decisions was
that a precedent for endorsements would endanger the core principle of ama-
teurism in college football. So, unable to follow two dreams, Jeremy chose his quest
for Olympic gold. The Buffaloes now have to play without their star wide receiver,
and many of Colorado’s citizens wonder about the NCAA’s logic — but many also
wonder whether the NCAA’s regulations discourage potential Olympians from get-
ting college educations. If these would-be ambassadors for the United States have
to choose between full scholarships to college or endorsements to supplement their
amateur training, are they getting the full support they should be getting for their
Olympic dreams — dreams that inspire and excite us all?
If you also have dreams of Olympic and collegiate glory, you need to be aware of
these conflicts. The moral: The NCAA, NAIA, and NJCAA are there to support and
protect student-athletes, but the rules don’t always work for you. Be sure you know
exactly what the rules mean and how they apply to you.
(continued)

declared degree, and following all the rules about maintaining your
amateur status — life interrupts your athletic pursuits? In the real
world, student-athletes do get hurt during their athletic careers. In
some cases, injury can put those athletes’ eligibility in question.
Unexpected pregnancy also can happen, and it too can adversely
affect a student-athlete’s athletic activities, just as an injury or ill-
ness can. Again, eligibility could be at risk.
You hope that you won’t be injured or get pregnant, but hope is
not a plan. You need to know what your rights are and what rights
the college has. You need to know how you can be sure that your
scholarship will be protected while you’re sitting out for a semes-
ter or two. Read on to find the information you need.
The rights of the student-athlete
So what are your rights as a scholarship athlete if you become
injured, get sick, or become pregnant? The first thing you need to
know are your association’s, conference’s, and university’s policies
on injury/pregnancy and scholarships.
In case of injury or illness
In case of injury or illness, you’ll need to be familiar with the medical-
hardship waiver for your university, athletic conference, and athletic
association. The medical-hardship waiver is supposed to determine
how much opportunity to compete you’ve lost. If the waiver is
approved, you may be entitled to an additional year of eligibility.
Illness can include anything from cancer to chemical dependency
to psychological illness — anything that requires treatment.
In NCAA Division I, you can apply for a medical-hardship waiver if
a season-ending injury or illness occurs in the first half of the
season. You must not have participated in more than two contests
or dates of competition, or more than 20 percent of the institution’s
scheduled contests — whichever is greater. So, for example, if your
school has ten games in a season, you can play in two of those, and
they have to be two of the first five games. But under NCAA rules,
any number with a “point” after it is bumped up. So if the school
has 11 games in the season, you can’t play in 2.2 games; instead,
you can play in 3 games — games 1, 4, and 5, for example — and
still qualify for a hardship waiver. If you compete in the second half
of the playing season, you’re not eligible for a hardship waiver.
In NCAA Division II, you can apply for a hardship waiver no
matter when a season-ending injury occurs, as long as you haven’t
Chapter 16: Maintaining Your Eligibility 241

participated in more than two contests or dates of competition or
20 percent of your school’s scheduled contests — whichever is
greater.
In NCAA Division III, you can apply for a hardship waiver no
matter when a season-ending injury occurs, as long as you haven’t
participated in more than three contests or one-third of your
school’s scheduled games.
In the NAIA, you can apply for a medical-hardship waiver if both of
the following are true:
 Your illness or injury is beyond your control and/or your
coach’s control and incapacitates you from competing further
in the season.
 You haven’t participated in more contests or dates than the
association’s allowable number in any sport recognized by
the NAIA during the school year. (Check with your school for
the allowable number in your sport.)
In the NJCAA, the criteria for a medical-hardship waiver are gener-
ally the same as in the NCAA and NAIA. Check with your school for
the number of games allowable.
In all the associations and divisions, specific and up-to-date medical
documentation from a physician and the institution’s athletic train-
ing staff is required in order for a medical-hardship waiver to be
approved. You can’t participate in sports (even practice) after being
examined by a physician and before receiving your written medical
clearance — if you do, your hardship consideration will be nullified.
If you participate in any outside competition during the second
half of the playing season, you won’t qualify for a hardship waiver.
The nature and extent of your injury will determine whether you
may be eligible for insurance from the college or from the associa-
tion itself. Your college may have what is called secondary and cata-
strophic injury insurance. You won’t have to pay a premium, but the
insurance usually has a deductible of about $250 (which means the
first $250 of your medical care comes out of your pocket and then
the insurance kicks in).
Make sure you already have primary health insurance that covers
intercollegiate athletics — that insurance should be in place before
you even start school.
Although statistically, most waivers submitted are approved, that
doesn’t mean getting one is easy. In fact, many athletes don’t get
Part V: When You’re in the Big Leagues 
242

approved. They often lose their scholarships — the schools revoke
them because the athlete isn’t playing.
The fact is that you’re at the mercy of your school when you’re
injured, which is why getting everything about your injury docu-
mented (and submitted to the conference office) quickly is so
important. Don’t do anything to jeopardize your waiver status —
like trying to participate in a practice or playing in a little pickup
game with some friends.
If you have questions, discuss your rights with your school’s ath-
letic director, and request written copies of the rules and policies.
Again, make sure you keep copies of all medical records.
In case of pregnancy
In case of pregnancy, you also need to apply for the medical-
hardship waiver. If the waiver is approved, you could be entitled
to a sixth year of eligibility. Although pregnancy is specifically 
mentioned (once) in each of the NCAA’s division manuals and in
the NAIA manual, getting waiver approval can still be difficult.
It is called the pregnancy exemption, and the NCAA Division I
Manual states
A member institution may approve a one-year extension of the
five-year period of eligibility for a female student-athlete for
the reasons of pregnancy.
The NCAA Divisions II and III manuals state
A member institution may approve a two-semester or three-
quarter extension of this 10-semester/15-quarter period of eligi-
bility for a female student-athlete for the reasons of pregnancy.
The NAIA Official Handbook and Policy Handbook states
A female student will be granted a two-semester or three-
quarter, one-time extension of the ten-semester rule due to
pregnancy. The requirement for the extension period of time
will be processed as an exceptional ruling to a standard rule.
The NJCAA’s hardship provision does not mention pregnancy
specifically. Instead, it says it is
available to students who are unable to complete a season of
competition or did not satisfy one of the eligibility rules as a
result of an injury, illness, or some type of emergency beyond
their control.
Chapter 16: Maintaining Your Eligibility 243

Because the NJCAA’s hardship waiver does not mention pregnancy,
it is up to individual schools (or conferences) to establish rules
regarding pregnancy in student-athletes.
Why is the pregnancy hardship waiver often so difficult to get in all
the associations? Because scholarship awards are made at your
coach’s discretion, and because scholarships can be taken away if
you decide to drop or quit the sport you were given the scholar-
ship for.
Voluntarily dropping out of participation is the number-one reason
in all three associations that pregnant student-athletes lose their
scholarships (see the “And then there was baby . . .” sidebar).
Because young women often don’t know what is safe to do athleti-
cally when they’re pregnant (and because many schools don’t offer
this sort of counseling and education), these athletes feel forced to
quit the sport entirely rather than risk injury to their unborn chil-
dren. In fact, it is widely considered safe to do any exercise up to
the 14th week of pregnancy (and some forms of exercise are safe
even after 14 weeks). If you’re pregnant and concerned about this,
talk with your obstetrician.
If you feel like you have to choose between your pregnancy or your
athletic scholarship:
 Find out what the rules concerning pregnant athletes are
for your association, conference, and school.
 Talk to your head coach and athletic trainer.
 Talk to your doctor (preferably an obstetrician).
 Do your own research about what you should and should not
do during each stage of your pregnancy. Go to www.womens
sportsfoundation.org for articles and advice on this
issue. And for an extensive study of what is and what is not
safe to do during all stages of your pregnancy and after (includ-
ing advice about nutrition), read Fit Pregnancy For Dummies, by
Catherine Cram and Tere Stouffer Drenth (Wiley).
The rights of the college
As you’ve probably figured out by now, you’re not the only one who
has rights if you’re injured, sick, or pregnant. The college also has
rights — as well as lawyers to interpret those rights — which is why
you have to be sure to abide by all rules and document any medical
conditions to the satisfaction of your school and conference.

Chapter 16: Maintaining Your Eligibility 245
And then there was baby . . .
Becky Ledbetter was one heck of a softball player, playing second base and short-
stop in Cedar Hill, Texas. By her sophomore year in high school, she was already
getting recruiting letters from universities and colleges around the nation. So she
began dutifully filling out and returning their forms and filing copies in her scholar-
ship box. But she already had her heart set on one university.
“I wanted to go to Baylor,” Ledbetter says. “It was my childhood dream.”
So when she got an acceptance letter from Baylor, she felt like her life was on track.
Still, she continued filling out and returning forms from other schools, just to be safe
(a wise strategy).
Ledbetter understood that questionnaires or letters of interest are important because
college coaches can’t follow you through your high school and club-ball career if
you don’t correspond with them (unless you’re among the top 1 or 2 percent of ath-
letes in your sport in the nation — and you shouldn’t count on it even then). When
coaches know about upcoming club games, they can come out to watch.
By her junior year, Ledbetter was receiving e-mails and letters from coaches who
were expressing intense interest in her playing abilities. “You could always see them
[recruiters] in the stands,” she said. “They kind of stood out with their college shirts
and colors. They would carry briefcases and wear their school hats, and you could
just tell they were recruiters and not parents.” It was an exciting time for Ledbetter.
The national championship tournament, the biggest tournament of the year, was
just two weeks before her senior year. Ledbetter should have had nothing on her
mind but that tournament. Instead, she had something to worry about. “I had sus-
picions that I was pregnant,” she said. “I was late. And, you know, as an athlete,
you’re pretty regular. So I just knew.” Standing under the night lights on the field, she
would feel faint.
At first, she tried to deny what was happening. “I tried to dismiss the whole thing.
Ignore it, and it’ll go away,” Ledbetter said. It didn’t.
Her team was very successful; it finished eighth out of more than 80 teams. When
the tournament was over and the rest of the team was celebrating, Ledbetter took
a pregnancy test. The results: pregnant.
She couldn’t ignore the problem anymore. “What was I going to do?” Ledbetter
wondered. She was an honor student, played three varsity sports, and had every
intention of playing — on full scholarship — at Baylor. That was her dream.
She continued to stay quiet about her pregnancy, but people around her began to
figure out what was going on. She refused to return phone calls and dodged her
club coach. When the club coach finally pinned her down, Ledbetter told him, “Oh,
well, coach, I can’t come back.” She said, “I was too embarrassed to say I was
pregnant, and so I just said I couldn’t play.”
(continued)

Your school will require you to take several steps from the day you
step on campus as a student-athlete in the hope of preventing
injury or, at least, preparing for it. You must
 Sign an acknowledgement of your assumption of risk injury
 Provide proof of primary insurance
Part V: When You’re in the Big Leagues 
246
When her high school coach heard the rumors floating through the halls, he con-
fronted her. Ledbetter admitted the rumors were true, and the coach simply “wished
[her] the best.”
This deflated Ledbetter. People were telling her now that she had blown it, that her
scholarship chances and her college career were over. And now her coach’s reac-
tion seemed to confirm her worst fears.
“I let all the [recruiting] letters drop, and that was that.” She dropped out of both
high school and club softball, even though she continued to get letters from col-
leges around the nation. She never responded to Baylor, which eventually gave up
and offered a scholarship to another athlete.
When Ledbetter’s twin girls were 4 months old, she got an invitation to try out for
Abilene Christian College’s softball team. But by then, she had listened to too many
naysayers. She didn’t even bother to try.
Today, at age 20, Ledbetter plays pickup games and also plays in a slow-pitch coed
league. She works as a teacher’s aide at a private school. And she regrets giving up
on her softball dream.
Her advice to other young women who might find themselves in this predicament:
“Don’t give up.” Ledbetter knows from experience that when teenage girls get preg-
nant, “so many girls think this is it; it’s all over. You’re a teenager, and you think it’s
the end of the world, but it’s not.”
When asked how she would handle her situation differently today, Ledbetter said,
“I would have found a way to take advantage of playing again. At the time I had the
girls, I still had a year left of eligibility to play. I could have tried to go to college
later.” But with few people supporting that idea, it was hard for her to try again.
Unfortunately, Ledbetter’s experience is far from unique. And her coach’s reaction —
simply writing her off at such a young and impressionable age — did a tremendous
amount of damage to her psyche. This also is not unusual. But if others can learn
from Ledbetter’s mistakes, she feels she will have accomplished something.
“Maybe I could have played at Baylor; maybe not. It took me so long to realize that
this was not the end of my dreams. I wish other girls could know you can still accom-
plish your dreams.”
(continued)

 Provide a medical history and a release for the college to
obtain medical information about you
 Pass a medical exam
But when the unfortunate does happen and illness, injury, or preg-
nancy occurs, the athletic department and the college itself will
demand that you:
 Provide proof that any claimed injuries occurred at the school
or at a sanctioned athletic event where the coach was present
 Give evidence that the college has been appropriately notified
 Comply with time limits set by the college for seeking treat-
ment and submitting medical bills
 Provide other appropriate medical documentation from a physi-
cian who provided care at the time of the injury or illness
 Show statistical evidence establishing that you competed in
the required number of scheduled contests
You need to be certain about your responsibilities for informing
the college and meeting its other requirements concerning your
injury. Check with your head coach, the athletic training staff, and
even your athletic director if you have questions or concerns.
Don’t assume you have all your bases covered. You could end up
with no insurance, no scholarship, and no eligibility.
Fighting for Your Rights
What if hope fails, and your eligibility is revoked because of your
injury, illness, or pregnancy? What are your rights? What can you do?
The most important thing to find out is why your eligibility has
been revoked. Perhaps you didn’t report the injury promptly to
your school, which can relieve the school of all liability. Perhaps
you sought medical attention from a doctor not approved by the
school, which also can relieve the school of liability. Perhaps the
conference didn’t get all the medical data it required to consider
your medical-hardship waiver. If not providing the medical docu-
mentation to the conference is the fault of the school, you don’t
have to worry — but if that’s your fault, you do.
The bottom line: If your school determines, for any reason, that
you’re ineligible under the provisions of the constitution, by-laws,
or other regulations of the association you belong to (NCAA, NAIA,
or NJCAA), the school is obligated to withhold you from all inter-
collegiate competition.
Chapter 16: Maintaining Your Eligibility 247

If your hardship waiver has been denied, or if you’ve been denied
eligibility pending an investigation into either academic or athletic
misconduct, you have the right to appeal (fight the decision). If
your school agrees with you that you’ve been wrongly denied, the
school may appeal on your behalf for restoration of your eligibility.
The burden of proof rests with you and the school.
We hope that you never find yourself the subject of any institu-
tional, conference, or association investigation. If you do, be sure
to do as much research as possible about your options, and talk to
as many experts as possible.
The best and most obvious course of action is to avoid any prohib-
ited or questionable behavior or action. If you have questions
about whether something is permitted, ask your head coach or
athletic director — even if it seems like a small thing, even if it
seems like a dumb question. You cannot be too careful about your
collegiate athletic eligibility and scholarship. Too much is at stake,
and you’ve worked too hard up to this point to throw it all away.

Redshirting
In This Chapter
 Understanding what redshirting is
 Deciding whether and when to redshirt
 Knowing the rules of the game
 Looking at graduation
You can’t help but come across the term redshirting when you
listen to sports shows, watch professional drafts, or read
sports magazines. It’s even a common term in the fantasy-sports
leagues. But what is it? Figuring out the meaning and rules behind
redshirting is as important as knowing the guidelines of the NCAA,
NAIA, NJCAA, and different divisions if you ever intend to transfer
or (temporarily) step out of sports during your academic career.
More often than not, student-athletes who redshirted never
thought they would do such a thing, much less need to know the
terminology. But as an athlete, you know that things don’t always
go as planned. Having a new game plan is always a wise idea. In
this chapter, we tell you what you need to know.
Is My Shirt Really “Red”?
No, but it’s highly likely that the term redshirting was derived from
the use of a red jersey. During the 1950s and 1960s, college football
players wore off-white practice uniforms and cotton vests, typi-
cally red, to distinguish the scout players from the starters in
scrimmages. Referring to a scout player as a redshirt picked up
among players and coaches.
Although the term is as commonplace as any other sports termi-
nology, you won’t find it anywhere in the NCAA by-laws. Officially,
the term redshirting does not exist. But it’s so widely used that the
term needs to be defined.

Simply put, the term redshirt is used to describe a student-athlete
who doesn’t participate in competitive sport for an entire aca-
demic year. If you don’t compete in a sport for an entire year, you
don’t use a season of competition.
So what’s a season of competition? The NCAA says that competi-
tion is participation against outside competition (for example,
another team from another college). This doesn’t include things
such as practices and intrasquad scrimmages. In fact, as a redshirt,
you’ll be expected to practice every day, and you’ll probably be an
integral part of intrasquad scrimmages; more than likely, you’ll be
on the scout team and help prepare the starters for the upcoming
game(s).
Many athletes report that playing or practicing with the squad is
an essential tool to coming onboard as a redshirt.
Why Redshirt?
Redshirting sounds complicated. You may feel as though there are
all kinds of rules involved. Or you may have heard that problems
are often attached to redshirt athletes. So, you’re probably won-
dering why anyone would want to redshirt.
Here are the two main reasons you may want to redshirt:
 You or your coach feels you need an additional year to pre-
pare for actual intercollegiate competition. This kind of red-
shirting usually occurs during your freshman year.
 You’ve been injured. You may hear this referred to as medical
redshirting, though the official term is medical-hardship waiver.
If you get injured during a season, you may be granted an
additional season by the conference office or the NCAA (if the
school does not belong to a conference) due to the “hardship”
you’ve suffered.
You aren’t by any means guaranteed a medical-hardship
waiver, and your school must appeal for this waiver on your
behalf and present contemporaneous medical documentation
to support the appeal. You must meet certain criteria in order
to be granted a medical-hardship waiver (and again, even if
you meet all the criteria, you may not get a waiver). See the
“Handling a medical hardship” sidebar for more information.
Redshirting automatically indicates that you’ll be in school for five
years rather than the traditional four.
Part V: When You’re in the Big Leagues 
250

Redshirting may require you to attend graduate school or pursue a
second bachelor’s degree if you graduate prior to your fifth year.
Of course, it takes many students four and a half to five years to
graduate anyway, so you could also simply continue to take under-
graduate classes during your fifth year and receive your bachelor’s
degree.
Chapter 17: Redshirting 251
Handling a medical hardship
The criteria you must meet in order to qualify for a medical-hardship waiver vary
from division to division in the NCAA. Here’s the lowdown.
No matter which division you play in, the injury (or illness) must occur during one of
the four seasons of competition, and you must be incapacitated by the injury for the
remainder of the year.
If you’re a Division I athlete, you can apply for a medical-hardship waiver if you’re
injured in the first half of the season and you haven’t participated in more than two
competitions or 20 percent (whichever is greater) of your school’s scheduled or
completed competitions.
If you’re a Division II athlete, you can apply for the hardship waiver at any time (not
just in the first half of the season), as long as you haven’t participated in more than two
competitions or 20 percent of the school’s scheduled contests (whichever is greater).
If you’re a Division III athlete, you can apply for the hardship waiver at any time (not
just in the first half of the season), as long as you haven’t participated in three or
one-third of the school’s scheduled contests (whichever is greater). Although
Division III does not allow redshirting, you may apply for a hardship waiver to gain
another year, provided that you meet the medical-hardship criteria.
As little as a decade ago, coaches could simply submit a letter stating the condition
(or the injury) of an athlete, and that was sufficient. Today, regulations require that
your injury be fully documented by your team’s trainer and physician, and be veri-
fied by the coaching staff. Letters must be on official letterhead from both the uni-
versity and the attending physician’s office.
Not only is this process a way to deter fraudulent claims, but it’s also viewed as an
injury surveillance system. By thoroughly documenting your injury — be it a torn
anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) or a swollen knee requiring an ice pack — viable
statistics regarding the health and welfare of college athletes can be collected.
Note: According to regular redshirt guidelines, you’re permitted to practice with the
team. However, by medical-hardship regulations, you have no business on the field
or court. By simply tossing a ball around or taking a few swings, you could jeop-
ardize your hardship waiver.
The bottom line: If you’re injured, talk to your coaches and trainers and, together,
come up with a plan that feels right for all of you.

Another reason student-athletes redshirt has everything to do with
personality conflict and little to do with sport. Redshirting is part
of college sports because the collegiate sports world is filled with
dynamic personalities. Sometimes, those personalities clash, and
the coach/athlete relationship just isn’t working. We’ve interviewed
countless athletes, parents, and coaches who talked about the need
to transfer (and redshirt) when that coach/athlete relationship
began to unravel.
Whether it’s a difference in coaching style, a question of work ethic,
the Saturday-morning lineup, or team responsibilities, sometimes
the best option is for the student to transfer to another school.
Transferring can force you to sit out of competition during your first
year at the new school, which is generally used as your redshirt year.
Talking about the Timeline
Various rules having to do with time govern your play as a college
athlete, and redshirting can affect each of them. In the following
sections, we spell it all out.
The five-year rule
At the Division I level, you have five consecutive years from the
time you initially become a full-time student to complete your four
seasons of competition (assuming you were a qualifier). This is
commonly called the five-year clock or five-year rule. The five-year
period is relevant because, even though you may redshirt one year,
your five-year clock is still ticking. So if you redshirt during your
freshman year, you have to complete your four seasons of competi-
tion during the next four consecutive years.
A qualifier is someone who is immediately eligible to play his fresh-
man year at a Division I or II school based on his GPA and test
scores.
At the Division II and Division III levels, there is no consecutive
five-year clock. The principle is the same with the 10-semester/
15-quarter rule at those schools, which says you have 10 semesters
or 15 quarters of full-time enrollment to complete your seasons of
competition. Unlike the 5-year clock in Division I, if you aren’t
enrolled as a full-time student for a semester or quarter, it does not
count toward your 10-semester/15-quarter clock.
Here’s an example of the five-year rule in action: Let’s say you come
in as a freshman, and your coach decides that you’ll redshirt that
Part V: When You’re in the Big Leagues 
252

year. You then play during your sophomore year, but during your
junior year, you suffer an injury in the second game of the season
that incapacitates you for the remainder of the year. You recover
from the injury and then play your senior year and your fifth year,
but you want to try to regain that season that was cut short due to
the injury. Unfortunately, in this scenario, even though you may
meet the criteria for a medical-hardship waiver, you have no more
time left on your five-year clock.
We cannot begin to tell you how many waiver requests like this the
NCAA receives — and almost every single one of them is denied,
because the decision to not compete during freshman year was not
beyond the athlete’s control.
The NCAA rules and regulations on these matters are hard to accept
at times. They’re also very clear. But because each situation is differ-
ent, we recommend that you contact the director of compliance at
your school or the NCAA directly if you have any questions.
You may be wondering whether you can redshirt if you play only a
few minutes in a season and then get injured. If the game clock was
ticking, that time counts, and you can’t redshirt the year. This rule
is a tough one to accept for athletes who were inured in the first
three minutes of the game, but according to NCAA regulation, any
amount of time counts as one of your seasons of competition in
that sport. Even if you run out onto the field or court for the last
two minutes and never touch the ball, you’ll be charged with one
season of competition.
The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) recently proposed legislation
to allow student-athletes in the sport of football to have five sea-
sons of competition and to eliminate redshirting and medical-hard-
ship waivers. The proposal didn’t receive a lot of initial support, so
the ACC withdrew the proposal, but don’t be surprised if a similar
proposal is submitted in the near future.
The 21-year-old rule
Another Division I rule that could impact redshirting in addition to
the five-year rule is the 21-year-old rule. Don’t worry — this doesn’t
mean that, when you turn 21, you become ineligible to play college
sports. This rule applies to you only if you haven’t enrolled as a
full-time student by the time you reach the age of 21.
If you haven’t enrolled as a full-time student by the time you turn
21, and you participate as an individual or as part of a team in
organized competition, you’ll be charged with a season of competi-
tion for each 12-month period this occurs prior to your enrollment.
Chapter 17: Redshirting 253

Clear as mud? Here’s an example: Let’s say you’re a golfer and, for
whatever reason, you don’t enroll in college as a full-time student
right out of high school. You still haven’t enrolled full time by the
time you turn 21. Your birthday is in June and, a month after you
turn 21, you play in your local club championship.
At this point, you’ve used a season of competition. You could play
in any number of organized events during this 12-month period
(until your 22nd birthday), and you would still be charged with
only one season of competition.
If the same situation occurred after your 22nd birthday, you would
be charged with another season of competition. So if you enroll in
college in August after you turn 22, with the intention of playing for
the college golf team, you’ll have two seasons of competition
remaining (because every athlete gets a total of four seasons of
competition, and you’ve used two) and five years in which to com-
plete them.
In order for a competition to be considered organized, one of the
following has to exist:
 Competition is scheduled and publicized in advance.
 Official score is kept.
 Individual or team standings are maintained.
 Admission is charged.
 Teams are regularly formed or team rosters are predetermined.
 Team uniforms are used.
 A team is privately or commercially sponsored.
The 21-year-old rule may be a factor when you’re deciding whether
to redshirt or even attend college. This rule tends to impact inter-
national student-athletes more than domestic ones, because inter-
national students often don’t start college immediately after high
school and most international universities don’t sponsor intercol-
legiate athletics (so student-athletes may want to attend college in
the United States, where these rules exist).
This rule is more stringent if you’re a tennis player, a swimmer, or a
diver, so if you’re an older prospect, discuss this rule with the
coach who is recruiting you or contact the NCAA directly.
At the Division II and III levels, a similar rule applies only if you don’t
enroll in college at the first possible opportunity upon graduation
Part V: When You’re in the Big Leagues 
254

from high school (that is, August/September if you graduate high
school in May/June) and if the competition you participate in
involves compensation or is with a professional organization.
Timing the playtime
A recent rule change at the Division I level allows student-athletes
to participate in preseason scrimmages or exhibition games
against outside competition during their initial year of enrollment
without using a season of competition. Beware, however, that this
allowance does not apply to all sports, because not every sport
has preseason scrimmages or exhibitions.
In Divisions I and II, if you play women’s volleyball, men’s or
women’s soccer, field hockey, or men’s water polo, you may com-
pete against outside competition during the nonchampionship
season (spring) without being charged with a season of competi-
tion as long as both of the following apply:
 You didn’t compete against outside competition during the
championship season (fall).
 You were academically eligible during this time.
Changing the game plan 
and playing instead
What if you (and your coach) planned on your redshirting, and
then your coach asks you to play in a game? Although not a very
common occurrence, this situation has happened, and you need to
be aware of the rules and the consequences.
Here’s the scenario: You and your coach had planned that you
would redshirt, but suddenly faced with lots of injured players,
your coach is desperate for a player and turns to you. Let’s say, for
example, you’re a football kicker. You have a great future with a
good school, and you’ve planned your future (and place on the
roster) with the coach. But in the final minutes of the last game of
the season, the final outcome of the game hinges on a possible
national title, and the kicker is injured. This situation is particu-
larly bad because the first-string kicker was injured earlier in the
season — so this most recently injured player is the team’s second
and only backup kicker. The team doesn’t have anyone else who
can kick field goals or extra points, so the coach turns to you.
Chapter 17: Redshirting 255

If the coach puts you in, and you play those last few minutes, you’re
now considered to have played a full season of competition — even
though you essentially sat out the whole season except for those
last few minutes. Some players who are redshirting even dress for
games just in case this situation arises.
If you’re tempted to think of this situation as unfair — after all, 
this goes against everything you and the coach have discussed —
remember that you’re part of a team, and your main purpose is to
help that team win.
Redshirting history among coaches
If you think you may be interested in redshirting, or if the coach
has a history of redshirting players, you’ll want to discuss this
topic during the recruiting process.
Some coaches recruit several players to come to their school
knowing full well they plan on redshirting a lot of them — but they
don’t tell the players until they arrive on campus and start school.
Don’t let this happen to you. Make an informed decision when you
decide to redshirt, and make sure it’s the right choice for the pro-
gram and for you.
Graduation and Redshirting: 
How One Affects the Other
Good news: Redshirting doesn’t affect graduation. In other words,
you won’t be penalized for redshirting or moving to another
school. Assuming that you stay on track academically, you may
expect to graduate on time.
If you’re moving to another school, be sure to speak with an aca-
demic counselor to make sure your credits transfer. Basketweaving
101 may not transfer from one college to another, but your stan-
dard college classes should transfer easily.
Statistically, very few college athletes move on to the professional
athletic arena. And too many are suddenly left without a real plan.
Without a job in the pros, college graduates find they have little
interest or life skills in anything but ball.
Still, consider graduation as you discuss the idea of redshirting
with your coach. Ask yourself:
Part V: When You’re in the Big Leagues 
256

 What are your interests beyond your sport? Redshirting to 
a different school where you know the coach and athletic 
program is helpful. But you must have reasons beyond sports
for changing schools. If you’re interested in medicine, attend-
ing an engineering school may not be your best move. As you
begin to look at different schools, consider what they have to
offer academically.
 Where do you see yourself in five years? This question is an
important one — and a difficult one to answer. Although you
may hope to continue in sports, playing professional ball,
you’ll need a backup plan. Perhaps you envision yourself
working as a pro-team trainer, a physical therapist, or a busi-
ness owner. By taking a hard, realistic look into your own
future, you can make a better decision about the school you
hope to move to. Again, consider the academic courses a new
school offers and how it fits into your own personal plan.
 Are you ready for more academic demands? At this stage in
your game, you have two things to consider:
• Will all your courses transfer to the new school? Talk
to an academic counselor at the new school to figure out
your academic standing and to be sure what courses
transfer and what do not.
• What will the new core curriculum be? If the idea of
becoming a sports nutritionist or veterinarian appeals to
you, but you don’t like the sciences, you have a prob-
lem. Consider what academic demands will be placed
upon you when choosing your future career.
 What other studies are you interested in? We love this 
question — it’s an important question that is rarely asked of
student-athletes. Throughout the recruiting and college visiting
process, you’ve been asked or will be asked to identify just one
major (or career) that interests you. How many people do you
know who had one job or one career throughout their lives?
There is no hard-and-fast rule that says you must have one
career choice. If you know you want to be a fighter pilot or
dental hygienist, good for you. If you’ve determined that you’d
really like to be both a fighter pilot and a dental hygienist,
even better! This narrows your field considerably when
choosing a good college, but it also opens new and exciting
opportunities and studies for you.
As you move forward, train for your academics with as much dedi-
cation and passion as you train for sport.

Transferring
In This Chapter
 Understanding the rules of transferring within the divisions
 Assessing your reasons for transferring: Looking before you leap
 Talking to coaches about a possible transfer
 Getting out of your scholarship
 Finding a new home
You may be considering leaving your school for any number of
reasons:
 You may have a personality conflict with a coach or teammate.
 Your grades may be in the toilet.
 You may not have enough money to continue at your current
college.
 You may be homesick.
 You may be overworked — or underworked.
Whatever your reason, you need to understand the rules and regu-
lations of transferring, as well as the effect transferring will have
on your college athletic career.
NCAA rules and regulations are complex, so it should come as no
surprise to you that the transfer rules can be confusing and the
process difficult. In this chapter, we walk you through the rules of
transferring. For even more information, check out the NCAA
Transfer Guide, available at www.ncaa.org.
In this chapter, we tell you the rules regarding transferring from a
two-year college to a four-year college, transferring from one four-
year to another four-year, and transferring from a four-year school
to a two-year school and then back to a four-year. Who knew you
had so many options?

Looking at the Rules
The grass may seem greener on another college campus, but
before you can move on, you need to make an honest assessment
of your status at your current college. (In this section, we fill you in
on what to look for.)
Additionally, you need to determine your eligibility standing.
Generally, you aren’t eligible to participate at an NCAA school you
want to transfer to unless you would have been eligible at the col-
lege from which you’re transferring.
If you’re interested in transferring to an NAIA school, you can go to
www.naia.org/local/transferguide.html for more informa-
tion about their regulations. Even if you’re working with a coach,
always double-check the institution’s rules and regulations to
avoid any mistakes or miscommunication.
Transferring from a two-year 
college to a four-year college
Even if you initially enrolled in a two-year college, your status with
the NCAA Initial-Eligibility Clearinghouse still matters if you want
to transfer to a four-year school.
If you never register with the clearinghouse, you’re automatically
considered a nonqualifier! (See Chapter 4 for more details.)
The good news: It’s never too late to register with the clearing-
house. Even if you’re in your second year of school at a two-year
college, the clearinghouse can review your high school records
and determine your qualifier status. This situation is common for
students who had no definite plans to enroll in a four-year school
immediately upon completion of high school. (Turn to Chapter 4 to
determine whether you meet the standards of an NCAA Division I,
II, or III school, or NAIA regulations.)
Transferring to a Division I school
Check out Chapter 4 to figure out whether you qualify based on
your high school records. If you’re a qualifier based on your high
school records, you still have to meet other specific requirements
to transfer from a two-year college for Division I:
 You must have completed one full-time semester or full-time
quarter at a two-year college.
Part V: When You’re in the Big Leagues 
260

 You must have 12 hours of transferable credits to a Division
I school. Remember: Not all classes are transferable. Talk to
your academic counselor to be sure all credits will transfer to
a Division I school.
 You must have at least a 2.0 GPA.
If you don’t meet the preceding requirements, you won’t be
allowed to compete during your first year at the four-year school,
but you will be able to practice and receive an athletic scholarship.
If you are not a qualifier based on your high school records, you
may still transfer as a partial qualifier or nonqualifier and be imme-
diately eligible to compete or practice at a Division I institution.
Before you transfer from the two-year school, you must meet the
following requirements to be permitted to practice, compete, and
receive a scholarship:
 You must graduate from the two-year college. Note that if
you attend more than one two-year college, at least 25 percent
of your credit hours applied to your degree must be earned
from the two-year college that awarded the degree.
 You must have attended a two-year college as a full-time stu-
dent for a minimum of three semesters or four quarters.
This rule excludes summer sessions.
 You must have completed at least 48 semester hours or 
72 quarter hours of credits that you can transfer to the
Division I school. You may need to speak to an academic
counselor about the number of credits you earned during
summer sessions, because this may affect your accredited
transfer hours.
 You must have at least a 2.0 GPA.
Most Division I schools have academic counselors solely devoted
to working with student-athletes. Your athletic counselor at your
new school will probably work with you and the coach to ensure
that you meet these requirements after transferring — whether
you were a qualifier or not.
Transferring to a Division II school
Whether you’re a qualifier, a partial qualifier, or a nonqualifier, you
must have certain credentials from a two-year college before you’ll
be allowed to practice, compete, or receive athletic funding imme-
diately after transferring to a Division II school.
Chapter 18: Transferring 261

You must have attended a two-year college as a full-time student
for at least two semesters or three quarters, and at least one of the
following must be true:
 You must graduate from the two-year college, and 25 percent
of your credit hours needed for your diploma must be earned
at the two-year college from which you graduated.
 You must have a 2.0 GPA and must have completed an average
of 12 credit hours per semester or per quarter, transferable to
any degree program at the Division II school.
The NCAA guidelines stipulate that all two-year transfer require-
ments must be completed before you transfer to an NCAA school.
If, however, you transfer to a Division I or II school as a full-time
student before you’ve completed such requirements, you must
complete one academic year (attending full time) at the NCAA
school before you’re eligible to compete — even if this means
transferring back to the two-year college to complete the stated
requirements.
If you were a qualifier or a partial qualifier, and you don’t meet
these requirements, you’ll be able to practice and receive institu-
tional financial aid (including an athletic scholarship) during your
first year at the Division II school, but you won’t be permitted to
compete against outside competition.
If you were a nonqualifier, and you don’t meet these requirements,
you won’t be able to receive an athletic scholarship, practice, or
compete during your first year at the Division II school. You will,
however, be able to receive institutional financial aid that is not
from an athletic source.
Transferring to a Division III school
The general guideline for transfers from a two-year college to a
Division III school is this: You aren’t eligible to compete until
you’ve completed one year at the Division III school.
The NCAA guidelines offer some exceptions to this rule. You are
eligible to compete immediately at a Division III school if you meet
one of the following qualifications before you transfer from a two-
year college:
 You haven’t previously competed or participated in intercolle-
giate sports.
 You haven’t practiced or competed in intercollegiate competi-
tion for a consecutive two-year period prior to the date on
Part V: When You’re in the Big Leagues 
262

which you began practicing and/or competing at the Division
III school.
 You’ve participated in intercollegiate sports, and you would
have been academically and athletically eligible if you had
stayed with the two-year college.
If you don’t meet one of these exceptions, you may still practice
and receive financial aid during your first year of residence as long
as you’re enrolled as a full-time student and meet applicable con-
ference and institutional regulations.
Division III schools don’t offer athletic scholarships.
Transferring from a four-year 
college to a four-year college
If you’re enrolled in a four-year school, you need a release from
your current school’s athletic director before you can begin con-
tacting other four-year schools about transferring. This rule applies
regardless of who makes the initial contact — you, your parents,
your high-school coach, or the coach at the college in which you’re
interested. If you get permission from the four-year school you’re
currently attending, all applicable recruiting rules apply. For exam-
ple, the coach at the school you want to transfer to can call you
only once a week, and you have a limit on the number of official
visits you can make, just as when you were in high school. (For
more on the rules of recruiting, check out Chapters 7 and 10.)
If you’re a student at a Division III school, and you want to transfer
to another Division III school, you may issue your own release —
called a self-release — and talk to that new Division III school about
transferring. If you want to transfer to a Division I or Division II
school, however, you’ll have to get a written release from the ath-
letic director.
The first thing you should do if you’re thinking of transferring is
talk to your coach and see if he’s willing to release you to talk to
other schools about transferring. You should do this even though
the release technically must come from the athletic director,
because the athletic director is usually going to make her decision
based on what the coach wants to do. More often than not, the
coach will grant you permission to talk to other schools. But if
you’re on scholarship and/or a key player, the coach may have
some reservations and say no.
Chapter 18: Transferring 263

If you don’t get permission to talk to the other school, you have
the opportunity to appeal that decision to a committee made up of
members outside the athletic department.
If you’re transferring to a Division I or II school, you must complete
one year of residence at the second school before being eligible to
compete. This applies regardless of when you transfer (at the end
of the year or in the middle of a semester).
There are several exceptions to this rule, but the most common is
the one-time transfer exception. You are eligible for this one-time
transfer exception if:
 You want to transfer to a school for a sport other than
Division I football, basketball, or men’s ice hockey. However,
you may qualify for the one-time transfer exception if you’re
transferring from a Division I-A football program to a Division
I-AA football program or from a Division I-AA scholarship pro-
gram to a Division I-AA nonscholarship program.
 You have never transferred from another four-year 
institution.
 You are both academically and athletically eligible at the
school you’re transferring from as well as the one you are
transferring to.
 The school from which you’re transferring releases you
from the one-year residence requirement.
All the exceptions are listed in the NCAA Transfer Guide (available at
www.ncaa.org), but what follows is a list of some examples where
you may be eligible to compete immediately after transferring:
 Your first school discontinued or never sponsored the sport
in which you participate.
 Your first school discontinued your academic major.
 You’ve just returned from at least 18 months of active U.S. mil-
itary service or an official church mission.
Moving from a four-year college to a
two-year college and back again
Let’s say you began your academic and/or athletic career at a four-
year school. Then, for a variety of reasons, you transferred to a
two-year college. Now you want to make the move back to a four-
year institution. You probably won’t be surprised to find out that
there is a separate set of rules for that situation.
Part V: When You’re in the Big Leagues 
264

If you choose to attend a Division I school and be immediately 
eligible your first year there, you have to meet the following 
qualifications:
 You must have completed 24 semester hours or 36 quarter
hours of transferable degree credits with a minimum GPA of
2.0 at the two-year college.
 You must have earned your two-year degree at an accredited
school. If you’ve attended more than one two-year college, be
sure that at least 25 percent of the credit hours received were
earned from the college of your graduation.
 You must wait one calendar year after transferring from a
four-year school to be eligible for play.
The preceding criteria aren’t necessary if you decide to return to
the four-year school you previously attended, directly after the
two-year school — unless you have an unfulfilled residence require-
ment at the time you left the NCAA school. You are considered to
have an unfulfilled residence requirement if you weren’t eligible to
compete at a school and you left before you completed two con-
secutive full-time semesters (or three quarters).
In Division II, the preceding rules apply, whether you attend one or
more four-year colleges before your full-time status at a two-year
college.
But what happens if you played at a four-year school, transferred
to a two-year school, and then want to go to a Division III school?
You must be both academically and athletically eligible to have
continued your education (and play) at the four-year school, or
you must have completed 24 semester credit hours or 36 quarter
credit hours that can be transferred from a two-year college.
Looking at Reasons to Move On
Transferring from one school to another is a long process that
involves research and comparison of academics and athletics, as
well as location, cost, and personal needs. Before transferring,
carefully consider all these issues and weigh your options. Ask
yourself why you want to transfer, and be sure that transferring is
the answer.
Following are some reasons you may want to look at transferring to
another school.
Chapter 18: Transferring 265

Your second choice doesn’t cut it
For many student-athletes, settling for second best becomes the
only option. Maybe the school of your dreams wasn’t interested in
you or didn’t have the scholarship offer that another school did.
Reluctantly, you accepted the second-choice school, hoping you
would learn to love it. But you never settled in — it just doesn’t
feel right, and you want to transfer somewhere else.
Before you go through the trouble of transferring, be sure you give
your second-choice school a fair chance. Try to make it one school
year before you transfer. Many students find the freshman year dif-
ficult — whether they’re athletes or not. You may find that by the
end of your freshman year, you do like the school you’re attending.
You’re not getting enough 
playing time
Playing time, or the lack of it, is the most common reason student-
athletes transfer.
But before you transfer because you don’t feel you’re getting
enough playing time, talk to your college coaches, your high
school coaches, your parents, and your teammates. Try to figure
out what the problem is. And be realistic. Talented athletes some-
times sit the bench their freshman year, for a variety of reasons.
Maybe you’re just having trouble getting used to being a smaller
fish in a bigger pond.
If you move from school to school, continuously dissatisfied with
the kind of coaching you’re receiving, people will start to think of
you as a difficult athlete. Some coaches see this as the behavior of
a prima donna they don’t want or need.
You don’t have enough money, 
or you’re not happy with 
the scholarship
You know that a promise is nothing more than a verbal commit-
ment. Even a written financial commitment to an athlete doesn’t
always hold. Because an athletic scholarship is only a one-year,
year-to-year contract, it is subject to change. You may feel over-
looked or unappreciated as promises for scholarship dollars go
unfulfilled. At some point, you have to ask yourself what you want
Part V: When You’re in the Big Leagues 
266

from your school, what you expect of your coaches and yourself,
and what you believe you are entitled to.
Student-athletes often transfer simply because they can’t afford to
attend that school anymore. If your scholarship is reduced or cut
Chapter 18: Transferring 267
School ties
When high school quarterback Adam Lybrand finally finished the recruiting process,
he and his family thought they had been through the recruiting wringer. A series of
misunderstandings, an unscheduled hand surgery, and open promises led Lybrand to
a smaller school. Because Lybrand did his research, and because he worked from
an active list of what he wanted from a college (Lybrand felt that he needed to be in
a Christian environment), he was willing to wait for and win the quarterback position.
Harding University in Searcy, Arkansas, had also heavily recruited Lybrand, so after
much deliberation, he asked his then-coach for a release. With the proper NCAA
release, Lybrand was granted eligibility status to redshirt as a freshman and was
set to play at Harding the following year.
Upon his arrival at Harding, however, no scholarship money was offered. Lybrand
studied the plays and prepared himself for the next year of eligibility, continuously
working out and training with the team. By his sophomore year, Lybrand had proven
to be a valuable asset to Harding, yet he was given only a small scholarship — noth-
ing that would pay his room and board, much less tuition.
Lybrand spoke directly to his coaches regarding his scholarship status and was told
that, when current seniors graduated, there would be money available. Yet the
money was slow in coming. Lybrand was willing to wait it out. Because of his abil-
ity, persistence, and loyalty to the team, he did earn a scholarship that would cover
all his tuition and some room and board.
Lybrand knew what he wanted. Other athletes may have opted to transfer again,
but he stuck it out. During the third game of his sophomore year, the first-string quar-
terback was injured, and Lybrand went on to start seven games. By his junior year,
Lybrand was the starting quarterback and setting records for Harding. In 2004, he
set records for pass attempts and completions, and was in the top five for passing
yards, passing touchdowns, and total offense. He also holds the record for 2003,
establishing himself as one of the outstanding quarterbacks in Harding history. Still,
he was not granted a full scholarship — something that was difficult for his family
to accept and very frustrating for Lybrand, especially as new recruits came onboard
with scholarship money.
So, why did he stay? Lybrand became part of the system and believed that he could
help his team. He developed a sense of loyalty to the school and honed the strong
work and play ethics with which he had been raised. With his new leadership role,
sense of family, and the community on the Harding campus, the issue was about
more than money.

for whatever reason, or if your financial-aid package doesn’t cover
the tuition increase, you may be forced to look elsewhere, even
though you really enjoy attending the school. Not all student-
athletes transfer because they don’t like the coach or aren’t getting
enough playtime.
The school is too challenging 
academically — or not 
challenging enough
Although transferring to pursue a more challenging education is
always commendable, many student-athletes transfer to avoid
tough classes. Some students change schools because the academ-
ics seem too hard or because they hope to avoid the hassle and
stress of studying at an easier college.
If you’re thinking about transferring, be sure you aren’t running
away from bad grades. The problem may be more about your
study habits or social calendar than about how much you’re able
to learn and retain. Before leaving for academic reasons, give your-
self a chance. Speak to your coach and guidance counselor,
arrange for a tutor, or request a study group. Make sure you give
yourself every opportunity to succeed.
You have personal or social 
reasons for transferring
Your reasons for leaving one campus to go to another may range
from lack of friends to too much partying to family problems or a
personal crisis. Whatever the reason, be sure that you aren’t run-
ning from the real problem by changing your location.
Talking to Coaches
While you’re enrolled as a full-time student at a four-year college, 
a coach from another college is not allowed (by NCAA rules) to
communicate with you. Chatting or politely acknowledging a phone
call — however brief — is not okay. A college coach or any member
of an athletic department may not speak to, write to, phone, or
e-mail you, your parents, or your guardians without written per-
mission from your school’s athletic director.
Part V: When You’re in the Big Leagues 
268

If you don’t have the permission of your athletic director to talk to
other coaches, no further communication between you and the
other school may take place. And the second school shouldn’t in
any way encourage you to transfer.
Even with permission and a successful transfer, you may not
receive any financial assistance for one full academic year as an
NCAA recruit.
If you move from a non-NCAA or non-NAIA institution to a Division
I school, you’re free to communicate with other coaches. You
won’t need written permission for contact. You can issue your own
self-release, a term used in Division III that means you’re free to
contact and transfer to another school.
Seeking a Release from 
Your Scholarship
Your athletic scholarship is a yearly gift from your college. If you
decide to transfer, your scholarship doesn’t transfer with you.
You’ll have to voluntarily withdraw from your sport and relinquish
your scholarship.
Talk to your coach, athletic director, and guidance counselor if
you’re thinking about transferring. To meet various legal and finan-
cial requirements, your coach and/or athletic director may choose
to hold a hearing to weigh your reasons for leaving the school and
withdrawing from your financial-aid award. You may want to
request an official letter of withdrawal from your coach.
Starting the Recruiting 
Process Over Again
When you decide to transfer, it is — as Yogi Berra said — déjà vu all
over again. You’ve been through this process before. It may have
been a pleasurable experience for you — you understood the
process and played the recruiting game well throughout. Or maybe
you learned things the hard way — no one told you about the
importance of playing club ball, promoting yourself, or getting your
name out by your freshman and sophomore years. Throughout the
recruiting process, you always seemed behind the eight ball. Or
maybe you did everything you were supposed to do, yet despite
your great efforts and researching, things went wrong.
Chapter 18: Transferring 269

Use this book as your refresher course throughout the process.
Continue to question yourself about what you want from the col-
lege experience. Is it just about playing ball? What about academ-
ics? How important is the scholarship?
You’ll find some differences in the recruiting process when you
transfer. For example, there is a good chance the coach at the
school has already seen you play at your current college or remem-
bers you from your high school days. Therefore, the questions
“Can you play for this coach, and are you good enough to play for
the program?” may already be answered.
The best advice we can give you if want to transfer is to make sure
that this is the right school for you. If you want to transfer again,
chances are you’ll be forced to sit out another year from competi-
tion and lose a season of eligibility. More important, however, each
transfer generally results in a loss of academic credit, putting you
farther behind in the real reason for attending college: to earn your
degree.
Part V: When You’re in the Big Leagues 
270
Deciding to stay put
Why wouldn’t you transfer if you were unhappy where you were? Particularly if your
scholarship were stripped from you? Outsiders ask this question with complete sin-
cerity. Why would anyone want to stay in a bad situation?
But in the athletic community, the loss of a scholarship means one thing: You’re
damaged goods. Right or wrong, this is the consensus among many athletes.
Athletes feel embarrassed and unworthy when they lose their scholarships. This
feeling is so powerful that many athletes give up the game and simply stay on as
full-time students.
In many cases, the scholarship is lost through no fault of the athlete — and coaches
understand this. Losing a scholarship may mean more than feeling disillusionment
or anger — it usually has financial implications. If you lose your scholarship, you
need to talk to the coaches and counselors about what the future holds. No schol-
arship doesn’t necessarily mean no playing. And if it does, it’s time to look for other
opportunities — other schools, a more-academic focus, other interests.
An old Chinese saying applies so well to the dramatic, unexpected, and often
unpleasant events in our lives: Whenever a door closes, another one opens. And
that is one thing that sports teach — to watch for an opportunity to score and take
it! When something goes wrong, look for that open door.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
he rest of this book covers everything you need to
know about scholarships, different college divisions,
recruiting rules and regulations, press kits, college visits,
and maintaining eligibility. What could be left?
Here we offer a few more tips on the recruiting process
and making the ﬁnal decisions.
Just as with every part of this book, this part is designed
to give you only the information you need and to help
you avoid some of the most common mistakes student-
athletes make.

Ten Things Not to Do during
the Recruiting Process
In This Chapter
 Making sure you follow the most basic rules of recruiting
 Knowing how to sell yourself
E
ven though this book is full of helpful information on how,
when, and where to follow recruiting guidelines, you may still
fall into certain traps along the way. In this chapter, we call them
out for you, naming the ten don’ts college recruiters would like you
to know about.
Don’t Overestimate Your Ability
Assuming that you’re better at your sport than you truly are is
easy to do. Very often, student-athletes (and their parents) think
they’ll automatically be recruited — and they simply wait for the
letters to start pouring in, the phone to ring off the hook, and their
e-mail inbox to be constantly full. This mistake is a common one in
the recruiting process.
Family, friends, and teammates can either help or hinder you in the
recruiting process. What you don’t need are a bunch of yes-men —
people who tell you no one is better than you, that you’re the
greatest, that you deserve and will get the best when there are
actually equally gifted athletes around you.
During the writing of this book, we met many athletes who told us
they believed the hype. They didn’t bother to recruit themselves
because they figured the recruiters would be standing in line, wait-
ing to sign them on. In many cases, they were simply left out or
overlooked.

Never overestimate your abilities. If you keep in mind that there is
always someone bigger, faster, and stronger, you’ll maintain the
right perspective.
Don’t Underestimate Your Ability
You don’t have to be the best player on the team and be named all-
conference or all-state to get a scholarship. If you have some skill
and a good attitude and work ethic, you can earn some scholarship
money — even if you have to ask for it!
In 1994, athletes filed into the hallway of the United States Olympic
Training Center in Lake Placid, New York, to see the latest posting
of those who had made the cut. It was during the trials of the U.S.
women’s bobsled team, and athletes had come from all over the
United States. Among them were strong, agile athletes from the
sports of soccer, field hockey, and track. Among that group was
author Alexandra Allred.
Alex had just had a baby and was still struggling to return to her
competitive shape when she was invited to attend the U.S. trials.
What she lacked in conditioning, she made up for in enthusiasm,
energy, and the undying quest to learn all the ins and outs of bob-
sledding — a highly technical sport.
To the surprise of many — including Alex — she made the cut
while some of the most physically gifted athletes were sent pack-
ing. When Alex asked how she made the cut among such strong
athletes, she was told it was her strong work ethic, positive atti-
tude, and willingness to work with others — an important trait for
bobsledders — that set her above the rest.
There will always be someone bigger, faster, and stronger than you.
But you can always have something else to offer. Your attitude,
combined with your willingness to learn, listen, and be a team
leader, will take you farther than fast feet and good hands.
Don’t Count On Receiving 
a Scholarship
A common misconception among parents and student-athletes is
that a scholarship will justify all the time and money they’ve put
into their athletic career. Even though you may have attended sev-
eral camps and/or showcases and had your own personal coach,
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
274

you may not get an athletic scholarship — and you don’t have to
get a scholarship from a Division I or Division II school to make all
your effort worthwhile.
In fact, many athletes opt for a Division III school because they
want smaller class sizes, because they want a more one-on-one
educational experience, or because the Division III school allowed
them to play as they always had — with joy for the sport and free
of pressure. Many athletes who later went on to become profes-
sional athletes or Olympians believe that a Division III school was
the best choice they could have ever made.
Don’t Think You’re Being Recruited
Just Because You Get a Letter
If you get a letter from a college, don’t make the mistake of thinking
that the school is now recruiting you. Athletic programs send out
hundreds and sometimes thousands of letters to “introduce” them-
selves to potential prospects. More often than not, the students
who receive these letters may never again hear from those schools.
According to the NCAA, a prospect is not considered to be a
recruited individual unless a coach calls him more than once; the
prospect makes an official visit; or the coach makes an off-campus,
in-person contact with the prospect.
Think of the letter you’ve received as the first of many exciting steps.
Don’t Downplay the Importance 
of Academics
Just because you’re the star of the team or the best athlete in 
your high school doesn’t guarantee you an athletic scholarship —
especially if you don’t have the grades and test scores to be eligible.
“Yeah, but Shaquille O’Neal did it,” we can hear you saying. This is
true. A small number of athletes have successfully moved to the
pros with limited education.
Recently, we were attending a recruiting conference when we
heard a conversation between a young athlete and his mother. He
had used O’Neal as an example of an athlete who skipped out on
higher education for a chance at the pros. Statistically, his chances
Chapter 19: Ten Things Not to Do during the Recruiting Process 275

of sharing O’Neal’s on-court experiences could be likened to win-
ning the lottery.
But we were struck by another fact: After all his successes, after all
his wealth and accomplishments, O’Neal went back to school to
earn his master’s degree at the University of Phoenix, lending the
message that nothing beats a solid education. When asked why he
went back to school, O’Neal said he wanted to ensure his future in
business after retiring from the sport.
Don’t Devalue a Partial
Scholarship
Full athletics scholarships are very rare. Unless you’re going to play
football or basketball at a major Division I school, the chances of
your receiving a full ride are remote. A few other sports (women’s
volleyball and tennis, for example) at the big-time schools may offer
full scholarships, but if you swim, run track, or play golf, for exam-
ple, don’t be offended if you get only a partial scholarship.
Don’t Believe Everything You Hear
Be careful who you take advice from. Many people think they know
a lot about the recruiting process when in reality they know very
little. You can appreciate their support and encouragement, but be
leery of their recommendations unless you’re sure they under-
stand the recruiting process. On the topic of “What Other Athletes
Wish You Knew,” numerous athletes and parents talked to us about
this very issue. Well-meaning friends, family, and teammates
offered them advice that did more harm than good.
Your best information will come from research. Follow the NCAA
guidelines. Talk to recruiters and coaches firsthand. Check out col-
lege Web sites, and review their history on recruiting, champi-
onships, coach turnovers, scholarship offers, and degrees offered.
Read blogs so you can find out what alumni have to say about the
school.
No matter what school you’re thinking of, you’ll find people who
will praise the school and others who will bad-mouth it. Talking to
other people is always a great way to find out more about the
school you’re interested in and investigate claims you’ve heard —
but the key here is research, research, research.
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
276

Don’t Ignore Your Gut Instinct
Just like most things in life, your first instinct is usually the best
one when it comes to the recruiting process and which school to
attend.
Money complicates things. Family complicates things. What your
friends and teammates think will also muddle your initial feelings.
In Chapter 10, we suggest that you take notes on the things you
see, what you hear, and how you feel. Refer to these notes often —
they’re important.
Don’t Be Afraid to Ask Questions
Throughout the recruiting process, you’ll be bombarded with
questions from coaches, family, friends, and others. Because you’ll
be the one most affected during the process, make sure you take
the opportunity to ask questions that will help you make the right
decision.
Don’t Trust a Cheater
If a school or a coach has been in constant trouble with the NCAA,
be careful when considering that school. The old adage “A leopard
does not change its spots” may come to mind here. Your college
playing career may not be as enjoyable if your team or school is
always under the NCAA microscope.
Again, research, research, research.

Ten Considerations When
Choosing a School
In This Chapter
 Considering issues beyond sports: Academics and social life
 Looking at how many athletes graduate or transfer
 Finding out about medical care if you’re injured
 Calculating the time commitment
A
s letters and phone calls come in, you can easily get excited
about an athletic-scholarship offer and forget everything you
said you wanted in a school. In this chapter, we remind you of ten
questions to ask yourself before you make the final decision.
Is the School Right for 
You Academically?
Not many high school students are 100 percent sure what their
major will be in college, but most at least have an idea what sub-
jects interest them. If you’re a female lacrosse player, and you’re
interested in majoring in sports management, your options for a
college that offers both that major and that sport could be narrow.
When you’re choosing a school, you have to consider not just your
athletic ability, but also the quality of the school’s academics and
the diversity of majors available.
College is a time of exploration and discovery. Don’t limit yourself
by the majors and careers you’ve heard about in high school. No
matter what school you attend, you’re sure to find out about
majors and careers you never even knew existed — and one of
those may be perfect for you!

Is the School Right
for You Socially?
If you’re from a rural town in the Midwest, attending a school like
Temple (in downtown Philadelphia), St. John’s (in New York City),
or the University of Southern California (in Los Angeles) may be
too much of a culture shock for you. And if you’re from a big city,
you may find smaller college towns like Bloomington (home of
Indiana University) or Santa Barbara (home of the University of
California at Santa Barbara) too slow paced. On the other hand,
you may relish the excitement of going to school in an environ-
ment completely different from the one you’re used to.
If you’re part of an ethnic minority, you may want to find out how
diverse the student body is. Are most of the minorities on campus
part of the athletic program? If so, would you prefer a school with
more diversity throughout the entire student body?
If you aren’t a big partier, you may want to make sure the school
you’re considering isn’t known for being a party school.
Remember: Even at the big party schools, you can find a niche of
people who are hitting the books more than the bars.
You can find out all kinds of information about the schools you’re
considering by visiting www.princetonreview.com/college/
or by buying the latest edition of The Best 361 Colleges: The Smart
Student’s Guide to Colleges (Princeton Review).
Is the School Right for
You Athletically?
When you’re considering a particular school, be realistic about
your chances of playing. Will you really enjoy your collegiate career
if you go to a top program and don’t get the opportunity to play?
We’ve heard countless stories of athletes who could have gone to a
bigger, more prestigious school but understood that their playtime
would be limited. Instead, they followed the heart of a true athlete
and chose playtime over status. Never have we heard an athlete
object to playing the field rather than riding the bench.
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
280

Co-author Pat Britz was offered a scholarship to play at Wake
Forest but understood he would be riding the bench for at least
two years and possibly four. If he played with the University of
North Carolina at Asheville, however, he knew he would be able to
play. Britz went on to play as a starter and left as the top scorer in
UNC’s school history as a Division I program.
If you play basketball or football, playtime as well as team style
could be major factors in your decision. If you’re a three-point
shooter, and you like to play in a “run-and-gun” offense, going to a
school where the coach focuses on a more controlled game that
tries to pound it inside may not be in your best interest. Likewise,
if you’re an option quarterback who likes to run a lot, you may not
want to go to a college where the team passes the ball 40 to 50
times a game. In both cases, you may want to consider other
options. Research the college you’re looking at to ensure that the
team’s style matches your style of play.
Is the Coach the Best One for You?
This topic is a hot one for many athletes and their families. Although
many student-athletes sign with a school for the opportunity to play
for a specific coach, that coach may not be with them for their entire
college career.
Ask the coach during your campus visit or interview how long his
contract lasts and if he’s looking elsewhere. Although asking the
question doesn’t guarantee a happy ending for you, it improves
your chances of knowing the truth and being able to make an
informed decision based on that information.
The National Letter of Intent states that you sign with a school,
not with a coach, so make sure the school is the right fit first. That
said, when you’re choosing a school, consider whether you like
and respect the coach. You’re going to spend a lot of time the
next four or five years with this person, and he can contribute to
making your life miserable or very happy. Your coach is definitely
going to mold you as an athlete, but ideally and more important,
your coach also will help you grow as a person and prepare you
for life beyond college.
If your coach leaves your college or university just a semester after
you arrive, don’t jump ship just yet. Remember: You signed with
the school for the school — not just because of the coach. Give the
new coach and your team a chance before chasing a coach who
has his own agenda.
Chapter 20: Ten Considerations When Choosing a School 281

How Much Time Will You Spend in
School versus Playing Your Sport?
Time management is a big part of being a successful student-athlete.
If your sport monopolizes your time, one of two things is very likely
to happen:
 You’ll get burned out or lose interest and quit the team.
Playing a sport is fun, but having to wake up at 6 a.m. for prac-
tice or weights, go to class for three or four hours, and then
go for more practice or weights is more demanding than most
incoming freshmen realize.
 You’ll start to struggle academically. Many student-athletes
don’t appreciate the lack of free time they may have when
they play a sport in college. If you don’t prioritize going to
class and keeping up with schoolwork, you could find yourself
not only off the team, but also out of school.
Make sure you know the normal, day-to-day schedule of student-
athletes at the school you’re considering.
Going to class is a necessity. Many people go to school as athletes
and think going to class is a nuisance. These are the ones who
likely won’t be around more than one or two years!
What Kind of Academic Services
Are Offered to Student-Athletes?
Most Division I programs have a department devoted solely to
assisting student-athletes with their class schedules, arranging
tutors, and helping out with other academic issues.
Playing a sport in college can mean a lot of travel, which also can
mean a lot of missed class time. If you aren’t an exceptional stu-
dent, or you don’t have a lot of self-discipline, you may end up
falling behind academically fairly quickly. With the assistance of
the academic counselors, you can find a tutor and make sure you
take the right classes.
The athletic department’s academic counselors don’t take the
place of the counselor you’ll have within the department in which
you choose to major. The academic department’s counselor will
help you make sure you meet the requirements to graduate in that
particular major; the athletic department’s counselor will help you
with studying and keeping your grades up.
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
282

Don’t expect counselors or tutors to do your schoolwork for you!
The athletic department’s academic counselors are there to assist
you, not to take tests and write papers for you. In fact, if they did,
it would be considered academic fraud and would get both you
and the counselor in a lot of hot water.
What Is the Graduation Rate of
Student-Athletes at the School?
Are you serious about getting a degree? If a school has a low gradu-
ation rate for its student-athletes, it may mean the focus for that
athletic department is strictly athletic, not academic. Although
some sports may have better graduation rates than others, if the
overall student-athlete graduation rate is on par with that of the
regular student body, this is a good indicator that the athletic pro-
gram’s priority is for the student-athletes to succeed academically
and earn a degree.
The NCAA requires its schools to provide you with a copy of the
school’s official graduation rates prior to your signing a National
Letter of Intent, so finding out what the school’s graduate rate is
easy. If you don’t receive a copy of it, you can contact the NCAA for
this information — it’s a matter of public record.
An incentive for Division I schools is called the Academic Progress
Rate (APR), which is the percentage of student-athletes who
remain eligible and/or leave school (transfer, go pro). For each stu-
dent-athlete who becomes ineligible and/or leaves, the school
could potentially lose a point, which will negatively impact its
(APR). If a school has a low enough APR, it could suffer penalties,
such as loss of scholarships or the ability to participate in postsea-
son play. The bottom line: The APR rules motivate schools to grad-
uate their student-athletes, in case the schools aren’t motivated to
do so on their own.
How Many of the School’s Athletes
Have Transferred Recently
If a program seems to have a new roster almost every year, try to
figure out why. Are student-athletes leaving to play elsewhere or
simply not returning to the team? If so, why?
Chapter 20: Ten Considerations When Choosing a School 283

Student-athletes may transfer for several reasons. They may feel
they’re not getting enough playtime, or personal problems at
home may require that they move closer to home and family.
Sometimes athletes are unhappy with their teammates or even
a coach.
Whatever the reason, if transferring seems to be a common occur-
rence in a school you’re considering, find out why. You don’t want
to go to a school where the team seems to start from scratch every
year.
What Kind of Medical Treatment
Will You Have if You’re Injured?
Injuries are part of the life of an athlete, so expect them when you
play at a higher level. The type of medical treatment available to
athletes should be a factor in your decision. If you’re planning to
attend a major Division I school, chances are that the school will
have at least one certified trainer at each practice and more than
one at games. In sports that have more contact (for example, foot-
ball), this is usually a no-brainer. But even for noncontact sports
(such as swimming or cross country), you want a certified trainer
to be present at practices and games in case you injure yourself or
become ill.
If having medical personnel present at noncontact activities is not
a priority for the school you’re looking at, you probably want to
consider going elsewhere.
Also consider the number of team doctors who work for the school.
Local doctors usually volunteer their time to help the school; in
return for their service, they get season tickets and other perks.
If a school has 500 student-athletes and only one team doctor,
chances are that the doctor’s time will be monopolized by the
major sports (football and basketball), so all the other athletes
may not get the same kind of care. You need to decide if you’re
willing to put up with that type of inequity.
Make sure you visit the training room and talk to the head trainer
so you’re comfortable with how you’ll be taken care of in case of
an injury.
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
284

What’s the Game and Practice
Schedule during the Holidays?
If you play basketball or football, you can pretty much kiss your
Thanksgiving and Christmas breaks goodbye. Most teams have
games scheduled during these breaks, and if there are no games
scheduled, you’ll be expected to stay on campus for practices.
The coach will usually allow to you to go home for two or three
days between the end of the fall semester and the beginning of
the spring semester, but you won’t have three or four weeks off
like the rest of the student body.
The same is true of spring vacations if you play a spring sport (golf,
baseball, and so on). While your friends are planning their Easter
holidays and their spring-break trips to Cancun or Daytona Beach,
you’ll be on campus practicing with the team or traveling to away
games. Your spring break may be little more than competitions and
extended road trips with the team.
If you’re planning on going to school several hundred (or even sev-
eral thousand) miles away from home, keep in mind that your trips
back to see your parents will be few and far between if you play a
sport. Sometimes, you may not know you’re going to have a few
days off until the day before, so planning a trip home may be
impossible. Feel free to talk to other players about how this works
so you can prepare your family and high school friends for how
little you’ll see them.
The important things to consider are these: How much time and
energy are you willing to give to your sport? And how much is
required at the school you’re considering?

Appendix A
College Scholarship Web
Sites and Resources
E
ven if you don’t get an athletic scholarship (or you get a par-
tial scholarship), you have many options that can assist you
with paying for college. In this appendix, we fill you in on some
helpful resources.
Free $ For College For Dummies
Free $ For College For Dummies, by David Rosen and Caryn Mladen
(Wiley), is a guide on how to find scholarships, grants, and other
“free” money to use for your college expenses. Here, you can get
advice on how to apply for federal grants, participate in state tuition
plans, and compete for scholarships from private organizations. In
addition, you discover how to avoid scams, how to complete appli-
cations on time, and how to find financial aid from unlikely sources.
Free Application for Federal
Student Aid
If you want to be eligible for financial aid, you’ll need to fill out the
Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), which will be sent
to six schools to which you’re applying to determine your financial-
aid eligibility. You can complete a FAFSA online at www.fafsa.ed.
gov. (If you’re applying to more than six schools, go to the FAQs
page on the Web site to find out your options for sending the FAFSA
to schools beyond your initial six.) The kinds of aid you might
receive include Pell Grants, Stafford Loans, PLUS Loans, Perkins
Loans, and work-study. The Web site offers detailed information
on all these possibilities and more.

Scholarships.com
This Web site (www.scholarships.com) offers free college-
scholarship searches and financial-aid information resources. You
can create a personal profile, and the service will present you with
information on the most relevant and attainable college scholar-
ship awards. You can sort scholarships by deadline, dollar amount,
and relevancy. You also get tips on how to spot fraudulent scholar-
ships. The scholarship database is updated regularly, so it pays to
check the Web site often.
College Connection
College Connection (www.collegescholarships.com) offers
free information on various scholarships. If you want to join the
scholarship search service, it’ll cost you $39.95 ($49.95 if you’re an
international student). The scholarship search service will search
a large database of scholarships for you. Keep in mind you can do
this work yourself, using this Web site and the others we list in this
appendix, although doing so is time consuming. If you have more
money than time, you may find this service worthwhile.
FreeGovMoney.net
According to this Web site (www.freegovmoney.net), the fed-
eral government gives away $10 billion in government grants
every month. From FreeGovMoney.net, you can buy their Grant
Information System ($39.99 if you download it directly from the
site), which has information not only on how to receive a scholar-
ship for college, but also on how to receive a grant to start a busi-
ness or buy a home, as well as grants for minorities.
ScholarshipCoach.com
Ben Kaplan, a Harvard graduate who (by researching and applying
for more than three dozen scholarships) amassed nearly $90,000
in scholarships and financial aid to pay for his tuition, is the
Scholarship Coach (www.scholarshipcoach.com), and his
Web site has a plethora of products to assist you in finding finan-
cial resources to attend college. Most of these are in a CD-ROM
format or printed book. Some of the more popular ones are Honey,
Athletic Scholarships For Dummies 
288

I Shrunk the Tuition; How to Go to College for Almost Free: 10 Days
to Scholarship Success; Essay Boot Camp; and The Scholarship
Scouting Report. These range in price from $19.95 to $49.95, but
some can be downloaded directly from the Web site for less.
ScholarshipCoach.com even has a Sports Scholarships link, which
offers basic information about myths regarding athletic scholar-
ships; general facts about the NCAA, NAIA, and NJCAA; information
about campus visits; and more.
GuaranteedScholarships.com
This Web site (www.guaranteed-scholarships.com) is simply a
listing of scholarships that are “guaranteed” as long as you meet the
minimum requirements of the scholarship. For example, if you want
to attend Albright College in Pennsylvania and you’re a member of
the National Honor Society, you can get a $1,000 scholarship. You’re
not in competition with other students for the scholarship — as long
as you meet the minimum requirements, you’ve got it.
To be safe, always check with the college offering the scholarship
to see what the requirements are.
CollegeBoard.org
Even the Internet home of the SAT test, the College Board, offers
advice on how to find college scholarships (www.collegeboard.
org/pay). This simple format offers a scholarship search of more
than 2,300 sources for college funding totaling nearly $3 billion in
available aid. In addition to information on how to apply for a loan,
this site offers a college financing calculator that estimates how
much it will cost you to attend college and how much you should
be saving each year to pay for it all. You’ll also find a financial-aid
calendar, which is helpful when you’re deciding when and where to
start the process of applying for financial aid.

Appendix B
Resources for College
Recruiting and Selecting
Colleges and Coaches 
T
he research tools in this appendix will help you select the
college that is best for you, as well as the best scholarship or
financial-aid options available to you. Throughout this book, we
suggest that you research individual colleges’ athletic programs,
their coaches, their graduation rates, and their individual aca-
demic and athletic requirements before you commit to one school.
If practice makes perfect, research certainly offers more security.
The following is a list of excellent resources that can help you find
the information you need:

of a particular coach. Services range from $599 to $2,499. (20

services, you must do your homework to find the best deal.
Research each site to find out what services it really offers, contact
the local representatives, and ask questions. Find out which one

Beware scholarship scams
Every year, hundreds of thousands of students and parents are defrauded by schol-
arship scams, to the tune of more than $100 million a year. Here are some general
guidelines to avoid becoming the victim of a scholarship scam:
 If you must pay money to get the scholarship, it may be a scam. Beware of
application fees (even for as little as $2) or any fee you have to pay before get-
ting a loan — such as “guarantee fee,” “insurance fee,” or “processing fee.”
 If the scholarship sponsor guarantees winnings or makes unreasonable pre-
dictions about success, it’s probably a scam. No legitimate scholarship spon-
sor will guarantee you’ll win an award. And when “guarantees” are made, there
usually are hidden conditions. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
 If everyone is eligible, something is amiss. No scholarship sponsor gives
money to students simply for breathing.
 If the sponsors claim that they will apply on your behalf, be wary. To win any
scholarship, you must submit your own applications, write your own essays,
and get your own letters of recommendation. You must do your own work —
no exceptions.
 If the sponsor requests personal information, such as bank-account numbers,
credit-card numbers, or Social Security numbers, it’s probably a scam.
 If the offer comes from an organization with an official-sounding name, check
whether there is really a federal agency with that name. And if the organiza-
tion claims to be endorsed by a federal agency, beware — the federal govern-
ment, the U.S. Department of Education, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
do not endorse private businesses.
 If the application has spelling and typing errors or looks unprofessional, be
careful. Legitimate sites pay attention to spelling.
 If there is no telephone number or return address other than a post-office box,
it may be a scam. A legitimate scholarship will have both a phone number and
an address.
 If you’re notified by phone, it’s probably a scam. You’ll be notified of a legitimate
scholarship in writing.

Don’t forget, during your scholarship search, to look into less-
popular or lesser-known scholarships (such as those offered by
smaller companies), unusual scholarships (such as the Student for
Organ Donation Youth Leadership Award, for students who have
made a commitment to raising awareness of organ donation and
transplantation), and scholarships for average students (such as
the Duck Brand Duct Tape Stuck at Prom Contest for students over
14 who are attending a high school prom in the spring). See more
of these scholarships at www.finaid.org/scholarships/
unusual.phtml and www.finaid.org/scholarships/
average.phtml. And remember that many companies —such as
Coca-Cola, Sears, Nike, and Balance Bars — offer yearly scholarships
or grants.
