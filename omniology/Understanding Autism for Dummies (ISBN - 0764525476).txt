About the Authors
Stephen M. Shore received a regressive autism diagnosis at age 18 months,
became nonverbal, and was deemed “too sick” to be treated on an outpatient
basis. Today, he’s finishing a doctoral degree focused on helping people with
autism lead fulfilling and productive lives. When not teaching college-level
courses in special education and teaching children with autism how to play
musical instruments, he consults and presents on autism-related issues inter-
nationally. Some topics of particular interest to him include comparative
approaches for helping people with autism, education, and disaster prepared-
ness for people with disabilities. He also focuses on challenges faced by
adults in terms of self-advocacy, disclosure, post-secondary education,
employment, interdependent living, and relationships.
Stephen holds bachelor degrees in music and accounting and information
systems from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. He also holds a
masters degree in music education and is on the cusp of finishing his doctor-
ate in education from Boston University. Although he seems to spend most 
of his time traveling in airplanes (Boeing 747-400 preferred), he resides in
Brookline, Massachusetts, with his wife on the rare occasions when he’s
home.
Linda G. Rastelli is an award-winning journalist, instructional designer, and
author with 20 years of experience in writing and designing instruction for
health, education, and business topics. In her career, she has focused on
making complex and technical information understandable to the layperson.
Although she has covered subjects ranging from financial ratio analysis to
educational reform, her most challenging inquiry to date — an undertaking
that has made her other projects look like finger painting in comparison —
has been autism.
Linda holds a bachelor of arts degree from the University of Delaware and a
masters degree from Columbia University. She lives on the New Jersey coast
with her husband and her cat, who have reached a blissful state of detente.
She hopes to keep her day job.


Dedication
From co-author Stephen M. Shore: This book is dedicated to my wife, Yi Liu,
my parents and siblings, and to all people on the autism spectrum.
From co-author Linda G. Rastelli: This book is dedicated to my husband, Bob
Galante, and to Robert Rastelli, in memoriam.

Foreword
T
here are many different educational programs and treatments for autism,
and their originators all claim that their methods are the best. The purpose
of this book is to provide parents, teachers, therapists, and others who care for
individuals with autism with a guidebook that offers objective, balanced infor-
mation, thereby enabling you to make intelligent decisions. Like the original
DOS For Dummies (Wiley), Understanding Autism For Dummies is meant to be a
user-friendly manual that cuts through the load of information you find out
there and helps you make the decision that’s best for your situation.
Autism is a neurological disorder caused by abnormalities in the brain.
Researchers have discovered that the parts of the brain that process emo-
tions don’t develop normally in autistic people. Further research has shown
that some of the long-distance circuits that connect different regions in the
brain may fail to connect. For example, one person may be sensitive to fluo-
rescent lights, and another person may be sickened by strong smells. One
individual may be more socially and emotionally related than another. It all
depends upon which circuits connect.
The autism spectrum is very broad and ranges from severe autism, where 
the child never learns to speak, to mild Asperger Syndrome, where the child
has no obvious speech delay. Doctors and caregivers don’t often diagnose
children with Asperger’s until they have problems socializing with other chil-
dren. An Asperger’s child may play alone and have few friends. Some individ-
uals with Asperger’s are very intelligent; many eccentric, famous scientists,
musicians, and artists probably had Asperger’s. The spectrum is continuous,
ranging from a person who needs lifetime help with basic living skills to a col-
lege professor. The great variability on the autism spectrum may be due to
the extent of the abnormalities in the brain.
Co-author Stephen Shore is a college professor who has autism. As one who’s
been there, he will walk you step-by-step through the complicated world of
autism spectrum disorders. An author who’s on the autism spectrum can pro-
vide an insightful perspective that many academic authors may lack. Co-
author Linda Rastelli is an experienced writer who brings unusual clarity to
some of the most confusing issues surrounding autism and its treatment.
Throughout the book, the authors use quotes and statements from other
autistic individuals so you can appreciate the varied nature of the effects of
this condition on the people who have it. I support this book and both these
authors because in addition to writing a badly needed resource on autism, I,
too, am an individual with autism. 
To help you better understand how far we’ve come, and how far we still need
to go, I would like to discuss some of my own early childhood experiences as
a child with autism.

I had no speech until I was age 31⁄2. For hours, I dribbled sand though my
hand. Loud noises, such as the school bell, hurt my ears the way a dentist’s
drill hits a nerve. Fortunately, I had a great early educational program that
started at age 21⁄2. All autism specialists agree that an intensive educational
program is most effective if started shortly after symptoms of autism occur.
Specialists disagree on which program to use, but everybody agrees that
waiting is the worst thing you can do.
Having good teachers is also vital with young children. I’ve observed that
effective teachers know how to be gently insistent so as to draw a child with
autism out of his/her world and improve both language and social interaction.
More than 50 years ago, the teacher who worked with me used methods that
were similar to some of the best autism programs today. I had structured-
speech therapy that resembled the behavioral programs used now. My
mother hired a nanny who spent hours each day playing games with me and
my sister. She had us take turns coasting down the hill on a single sled or
playing board games. Every day I had to sit through three family meals where
I had to behave and use good table manners. All these activities added up to
over 40 hours a week where I was kept tuned in to the world and wasn’t
allowed to tune out and retreat into my autistic world of humming, twirling
things, and rocking.
Today, I, too, am a college professor who has made contributions to animal
science and who has been able to offer hope and perspective to others with
autism and to those who care for individuals with autism.
Another important function of this book is to lead you through the maze of the
different medical and biomedical treatments. This is often an area of contro-
versy. Stephen Shore and Linda Rastelli explain all the methods in an even-
handed manner, which enables you to make rational decisions. Due to the great
variability of autism, a medication or biomedical intervention that works for
one individual may not work for another. It’s usually best to carefully try differ-
ent things. Keep using those things that seem to work, and stop using things
that don’t work. In very young children, it’s often best to try the safest meth-
ods first, such as diets and supplements. Some older children and adults may
need to take conventional medication to control anxiety, aggression, or obses-
sive-compulsive behaviors. In some individuals, a combination of conventional
medication and biomedical treatment may be most beneficial. For other indi-
viduals, we have yet to discover what helps. But every day, scientists,
researchers, therapists, parents, behavioral specialists, nutritionists, and indi-
viduals with autism are contributing to the growing body of knowledge about
autism spectrum disorders with the goal that, some day, all individuals with
autism can make their place in the world and help make it better for everyone.
Don’t give up hope. Trust your instincts, and use the network of parents, teach-
ers, and others devoted to the care of people with autism to help you cope and
provide the best environment you can for you and your family.

Introduction
T
he Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta estimates that as many as half a
million children in the United States alone have some form of autism.
Still, some doctors inform the parents of the diagnosis, hand them some pam-
phlets, and tell them, in effect, good luck! Many pediatricians have never seen
an autistic patient, so they don’t know what to look for, and uninformed doc-
tors may tell parents who have concerns that they’re overreacting and that
they need to wait and see. Such an approach is risky if your child is display-
ing symptoms of an autism spectrum disorder, because time is so crucial; we
explain why in this book.
If you’re reading this book, you probably have a child or other loved one
who’s received a diagnosis of autism or developmental disability, or maybe
you suspect that your child is showing symptoms that you’ve heard associ-
ated with the disorder before, and you want to find out more. Maybe you’ve
received such a diagnosis yourself. The diagnosis of autism can be a devastat-
ing and confusing experience, and you want answers fast. You have so many
questions, and you don’t even know which ones to ask first. How do you put it
all together? What do you do tomorrow? Next week? We designed this book to
help you answer those questions. If you don’t have an autistic relative or
dependent, but you do have questions about how to educate, advocate for, or
communicate with the autistic people in your life, this book can help you, too.
But first, you need to understand what autism is and isn’t. Autism is a neurobio-
logical condition that may come with many challenges, but also imparts great
gifts. Autism isn’t a mental illness, a result of bad parenting, or a death sentence
for fulfilling and productive lives. Many autistic people have made great strides
personally and have given amazing contributions to the understanding of
autism, including the author of our foreword, Dr. Temple Grandin, who teaches
animal science at Colorado State University. Grandin is a sought-after profes-
sional speaker on autism and the inventor of numerous livestock-handling inno-
vations. I (co-author Stephen Shore) was diagnosed with atypical development
and strong autistic tendencies when I was 2 1⁄2, but with much help from my par-
ents, friends, teachers, wife, and other professionals, I’ve gone on to the finish-
ing stages of my doctoral dissertation, and I teach college courses and other
activities. I’m honored to be able to contribute to the autism community.
Autism isn’t new, but professionals no longer consider it rare. Autism touches
the lives of more people than ever before, yet — and maybe because of this
frequency — we have much reason for hope.

About This Book
You have in your hands an introductory reference to get you started in your
quest to know what to do and where to turn in order to help people with
autism. We provide plans and suggestions that we hope are useful to you,
whether you’re a parent, caregiver, family member, child-care worker,
teacher, therapist, or other person supporting an individual with autism.
Understanding Autism For Dummies is designed to provide accessible, practi-
cal, user-friendly information in a format that’s easy to navigate and follow.
We designed each chapter to be self-contained so that you don’t have to read
the book sequentially or read the first parts to understand any later chapters.
You should concentrate only on what you need. The table of contents and the
index can help guide your search.
Because the topic of autism is so broad, we rely on many contributions from
experienced professionals, experienced caregivers, and people with autism,
such as Dr. Temple Grandin. We feel fortunate to have their input, and we
believe you will, too. Along the way, we also share quotes and insights from
parents of kids with autism and people who live with autism. These people
may or may not have stories that are similar to your own, but you can be con-
fident that they’ve all come through the fire and want to help others to under-
stand what it’s like and what they can do to help people with autism.
This book will help you sort out the bad ideas from the good and to understand
that each child’s plan for intervention is as different as each child’s symptoms.
And above all, we hope not to insult our audience. We’ve taken care not to make
light of what can be a challenging and heart-wrenching disability. “Dummies” are
people approaching a new subject who want clear, concise explanations and
guidance. We’re confident this book will serve your wants and needs.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you navigate the waters of this book, we’ve set up a few conventions:
 We use italics for emphasis and to highlight new words or terms that we
define.
 We use boldface text to indicate the action part of numbered steps and
to highlight key words or phrases in bulleted lists.
 We put all Web addresses in monofont for easy identification.
Also, we’re aware that some people with autism prefer to be called just 
that, “people with autism,” whereas others on the spectrum prefer “autistic
people.” Although we respect each individual’s preference and understand
2
Understanding Autism For Dummies 

that nobody wants the label “autistic” to define a person, for purposes of
clarity and simplicity, we use various constructions throughout this book.
Likely, you’ll read the terms low functioning, which describes people with
severe autism who have great difficulty in successful communication and just
making sense of their environment, and high functioning, which describes
people with mild autism or Asperger Syndrome who have greater verbal abil-
ity and increased success with interactions and their environment.
And although the word “autism” itself may not be as precise as terms like
“communication disorder,” “Pervasive Developmental Disorder,” or even
“autism spectrum disorder,” we think it’s a useful term, so we use it to
describe the set of symptoms we outline in Part I.
No matter what terms you use, it’s important to remember that although
some people use labels to limit others, you can use labels to encourage
greater awareness, cooperation, and understanding. An autism label can be
useful in terms of obtaining services, for example.
What You’re Not to Read
You don’t absolutely, positively have to read every word in this book, but
that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t. The bottom line is that if you’re in a
hurry, you can skip some topics and still not miss the important stuff you
need. Sections you can skip include the following:
 Text in sidebars: Sidebars are shaded boxes of text that appear through-
out the book. They contain personal stories and observations, along
with more technical discussions, provided for your enjoyment.
 Any text with the Technical Stuff icon attached: These paragraphs pro-
vide further explanation about autism, but the information isn’t neces-
sary for your general understanding of the subject.
Foolish Assumptions
We assume that you’re affected by autism or an autism spectrum disorder,
either personally, professionally, or both. You’ve probably heard the term
Pervasive Developmental Disorder or autism spectrum disorder, but nobody
has explained what it has to do with autism. You can attribute the lack of
common knowledge to the fact that researchers still disagree about how to
classify autism-related conditions.
We assume you have a brain, but that you don’t perform brain surgery. Because
you’re not a brain surgeon, this book avoids the kind of terms only a doctor
3
Introduction

completely understands. When we include technical terms, we provide 
explanations.
We assume that if you’re a parent or caregiver to a person with autism,
you’ve come to this book to find out how to understand and relate to that
person more effectively. Or maybe you want to understand yourself better,
having been diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome or autism at some point in
your life. If this is the case, we assume that you want to explore what makes
you neurologically different and how people like you have coped with it and
gone on to find ways to leverage their strengths.
Although we write many chapters with early intervention of children in mind,
we assume that some of you want information about adult issues. Many
adults may not be attending school, but they have questions pertaining to
work, health, and relationships, and we try to address these concerns as well.
How This Book Is Organized
We set up Understanding Autism For Dummies in self-contained chapters that
deal with many different topics. You can read the chapters out of order, or
you can consume the book cover to cover. The following sections describe
the parts of this book so you can pick and choose your spots.
Part I: Understanding Autism
Part I provides the basics — what autism is, what may cause it, what symptoms
you should be aware of, and where to go from there. In this part, we begin by
exploring the behavioral symptoms of autism and how medical doctors typi-
cally diagnose — or misdiagnose — autism spectrum disorders. We explain the
many forms autism can take and give you a checklist of behavioral symptoms.
We discuss why people often confuse autism with other disorders and how you
can sort them out. We include info on how you can plan ahead after you get a
diagnosis and what steps to take to get help. Finally, we devote a whole chapter
to Asperger Syndrome, autism’s often-misunderstood cousin.
Part II: Addressing Physical Needs
In Part II, we lay out the options for medical treatment — from medications
that may alleviate some symptoms associated with autism to complementary
biomedical treatments breaking new ground today.
Healthcare can be very difficult when the patient can’t explain what’s bother-
ing him. This part goes into depth about what medical science has discovered
4
Understanding Autism For Dummies 

about treating autism, what medications to consider, and health issues, such
as food intolerances and digestive problems, many autistic people face. And
because food intolerances are so common, we devote an entire chapter to
helping you understand what dietary changes you may need to make. Another
chapter stresses boosting the immune system. We also strive to answer some
important questions you may have: What symptomatic relief do drugs offer,
and is it okay to prescribe them for children? What does the emerging biomed-
ical research show? How do you find a doctor you can trust?
Part III: Enhancing Learning 
and Social Skills
Learning and social skills often go hand in hand, so we group these topics
together in Part III. We begin by presenting some interventions you can try
with your loved one. We help you understand educational/behavioral treat-
ments, from the Lovaas method, the original and still the most common stan-
dard of intervention in many places, to newer options gaining in popularity,
such as Greenspan’s Floortime, the Miller Method, and Daily Life Therapy. We
also do our best to present some nonmedical interventions you may want to
explore to help with sensory, social, or other challenges.
Children with autism can learn, but in different ways than you may think, and
they can be very different from one another. Switching the focus to educa-
tion, we lead you through the process of finding an appropriate classroom or
program for your loved one and developing a proper educational plan tailored
to his or her needs. We’re also there to help protect your child’s educational
rights — what state or district you live in can make a big difference in how
people interpret and implement the law.
Finally, we give you some tips on managing your loved one’s sensory issues
and on fostering good relationships with autistic children and others.
Part IV: Living with Autism as an Adult
What happens after childhood? Many autistic individuals go on to live inde-
pendently. Other adults may require permanent care or some combination of
supervision and partial independence. In Part IV, we address many life issues
that adults with autism face. We explain what life can be like for autistic indi-
viduals after high school, we explore some ways people with autism can pre-
pare for romantic adult relationships, and we help prepare the autistic adult
and his or her caregivers for the financial aspects of independence, whether
it’s full or partial.

Introduction

Part V: The Part of Tens
Of course, lists are what many readers can’t resist looking at first. We don’t
mind; feel free to skip to the back of the book, where you can find lists full of
helpful hints and tips. We present some answers for the challenging and
sometimes uncomfortable questions people with autism (and their loved
ones) are bound to hear. We also give you ten important things to do after
you receive the autism diagnosis.
But wait — there’s more! We include an Appendix at the end of the book that
lists places you can go for treatment and associations and organizations that
deal with research, treatment, advocacy, and parental issues. These organiza-
tions can help you build upon the information you find in this book.
Icons Used in This Book
The icons in this book help you find particular kinds of information that may

Where to Go from Here
Autism isn’t a simple subject you can master in an afternoon, like, say, square
dancing. (Please, no letters from angry square dancers!) As such, we didn’t
design the book to be a front-to-back page-turner that prepares you for a test
or project. You can jump in at any point, depending on what you’re looking
for. For example, if you or someone you know has just been diagnosed with
autism, you may want to read Chapters 1, 2, and 18 first to better understand
autism and what you should do after a diagnosis. If you’re a healthcare profes-
sional or caregiver dealing with autism, you may want to skip ahead to Part II,
which covers health care for people with autism. If you’re an educator, Part III
is for you, as it deals with learning. And if you or someone you love is living
with autism as an adult, Part IV includes chapters that discuss relationships,
work, and money managing for adults with autism.
If you don’t have an agenda and just want to begin building your knowledge
of the subject, start on any page and see what you find. Also, stay alert for
news in the media and in other books.

Part I
Understanding
Autism

In this part . . .
T
he main thing people lack when they first come into
contact with people who have autism or first discover
signs of the disorder in a loved one is knowledge.
Knowledge is the key to understanding, acceptance, treat-
ment, and happiness. Allow us to help bring you that
knowledge!
In Part I, you get the big picture about autism and autism
spectrum disorders, including Asperger Syndrome. We
explain why autism isn’t simple to diagnose or to treat;
you find out what common symptoms many (but hardly
all) people with autism share; and you review current 
theories about what causes autism and how Asperger
Syndrome fits into the picture. You also review the differ-
ent types of autism. As you begin to understand what
autism is and what it isn’t, you start to see how you can
make good decisions about treatment and education for
people with autism.

In This Chapter
 Consuming the known facts about autism
 Reviewing the diagnostic process and symptoms of autism
 Coping with the impact of an autism diagnosis
 Implementing interventions to help your child’s condition
 Taking steps if you think you have (or know of someone with) undiagnosed autism
P
arents never want to hear that their child has been diagnosed with
autism — and, at least initially, they certainly find it very difficult to
accept the fact that autism has no known cure. However, if you observe char-
acteristics in your child that you can’t explain or alleviate, and if you can
associate some of these characteristics with autism, you need to discuss
your concerns with your doctor immediately. And if your child already has an
autism diagnosis, you need to take action as soon as possible. Educate your-
self about treatment options, and work with your doctor to formulate a treat-
ment plan that meets your child’s needs.
With emerging science, autistic children are getting better. Through treat-
ment plans, the care of extraordinary physicians, and the support of family
members and caregivers, autistic children are looking healthier, behaving
more appropriately, making friends, having conversations, having play dates,
and being mainstreamed at school. Your child can significantly improve and
go on to maximize his or her potential abilities.
But before you reap the benefits of and make decisions about your child’s
healthcare, you need to empower yourself with knowledge. This chapter is a
great starting point, because it provides a big-picture look at autism: what it
is, how doctors diagnose it, and how you can manage the symptoms to make
a difference in your child’s life and yours — and you can!

What We Know — and Don’t Know —
about Autism
If your child has a developmental disability, such as an autism spectrum dis-
order, it’s very unlikely that anything you did, or any specific event, caused
his or her condition. Autism is a complex and not very well understood con-
dition. Researchers are working on finding answers, but the questions them-
selves still aren’t clear. As a result, the research is fragmented, and many
theories are in the testing stage. Researchers are rapidly gathering data, 
but in the meantime, they disagree about how to interpret it. For example,
researchers may observe malfunctions in different processes in the body of
an autistic individual, but they can’t agree on whether a particular problem is
a symptom or a cause of autism. So, debates are ongoing in the medical com-
munity about what causes autism and how to treat it. (See Chapter 3 for a
detailed discussion on the causes of autism.)
Here are the facts that all professionals and caregivers can agree on:
 Developmental disabilities such as autism are brain-based, neurological
conditions that have more to do with biology than with psychology.
 Autism is the most common member of a family called autism spectrum dis-
orders (ASDs), also known as Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDDs).
 Autism is usually diagnosed by the time a child is 3 years old.
 Autism is found in every country, every ethnic group, and every socio-
economic class.
 Autism affects as many as one and a half million people in the United
States alone, with 24,000 children being diagnosed every year. This
figure is comparable to other Western countries.
 Autism is diagnosed four times as often in boys than in girls.
 One in 166 children are being diagnosed with autism in the United
States. That figure has skyrocketed in the last 30 years.
 Children who are diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder need
early intervention as soon as possible.
And here are the topics that professionals and caregivers are still debating:
 Autism is thought to be biologically based, although researchers are still
trying to understand its exact causes. In other words, a child’s genetic
makeup must be predisposed to allow autism to develop, but genes are
not the same as causes. A genetic predisposition provides fertile soil for
12
Part I: Understanding Autism 

a trigger, but researchers haven’t been able to pinpoint the exact trig-
gers (see Chapter 3 for more on the topic of causation). Each diagnosed
case of autism appears to have its own pattern, like a fingerprint.
 Some experts believe autism has one overriding cause, and others insist
that it has multiple causes. Some research divides autism into different
subtypes based on the supposed trigger.
 Biomedical treatments can improve autism symptoms, but the debate
rages on about whether biomedical treatments deal with the root causes
of the disorder or simply help children who were “not really autistic” in
the first place. The medical community doesn’t widely accept many bio-
medical treatments; however, some doctors practice the techniques and
experience great success with their patients.
Despite what the medical community still doesn’t know about autism, we
have reason for hope. New techniques for studying the human brain may lead
to cures, new treatments, and interventions for autism and other puzzling
neurological riddles such as Alzheimer’s and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity
Disorder (see Chapter 2 for more on disorders that doctors may associate
with autism). In addition, advocates are proposing more funding and legisla-
tion that will expand knowledge of autism as of press time.
Making the Diagnosis: 
Learning Your ASDs
The typical diagnosis of autism is a trickle-down process:
1. You notice some atypical characteristics for your child at his or her
particular age. 
2. You schedule an appointment with your pediatrician, and if she sus-
pects a developmental disorder, she refers you to a specialist (such as
a neurologist). 
3. The specialist tests your child to see whether any of the autism spec-
trum disorder categories apply and makes the diagnosis.
Sometimes, a child can go undiagnosed until school age. With mild autism, a
child may never be diagnosed. The pages that follow prepare you for the
process at hand. See Chapter 2 for info on the different types of autism,
Chapter 4 for more on receiving a medical diagnosis, and Chapter 18 to find
out what to do after you receive a diagnosis of autism.
13
Chapter 1: Autism: The Big Picture

Understanding the diagnostic criteria
Autistic disorder is classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, a refer-
ence published by the American Psychiatric Association, as having 6 or more
symptoms from a list of 12 possible symptoms, which the manual groups into
three areas: social interaction, communication, and behavior. The DSM is
revised regularly, and so are the categories.
Your child must have at least six symptoms, with at least two symptoms 
indicating social-interaction deficits and one symptom in each of the commu-
nication and stereotyped-patterns-of-behavior categories. A child who has
most of the symptoms — up to 12, according to the American Psychiatric
Association — will usually be diagnosed as autistic, or sometimes as having
classic autism. Others who have only a few symptoms may be classified as
developmentally disabled, with autistic-like features. If you’re thinking this
sounds imprecise, you’re right. Researchers are still debating which disor-
ders belong on the autism spectrum. Chapter 2 goes into more detail about
autistic subtypes and related disorders.
Asperger Syndrome is also listed as one of the Pervasive Developmental
Disorders. Diagnosticians focus on the social and behavioral categories for
this part of the spectrum, due to the lack of significant clinical delay in verbal
communication in people with Asperger Syndrome. (See Chapter 5 for more
about Asperger Syndrome.)
Here are the 12 symptoms listed within their respective categories:
 Social interaction:
• Marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors
• Failure to develop age-appropriate peer relationships
• Lack of spontaneous seeking to share interests and achievements
with others
• Lack of social or emotional reciprocity
14
Part I: Understanding Autism 
Looks can be deceiving
Because many people with autism seem physi-
cally healthy, some people — even parents of
autistic children — believe the milder forms of
autism aren’t real disabilities at all. Outsiders
may believe the diagnosis doesn’t excuse poor
behavior, and they blame the parents or the
child himself for his lack of control. This blame
game is unfortunate, because a neurological
disability left untreated can have a far-reaching
impact on a person’s well-being and ability to
achieve potential in life. For a list of responses
to this reaction and other unfortunate beliefs,
head to Chapter 17.

 Communication:
• Delay in or lack of spoken language development (with no compensa-
tion through alternative modes of communication) in verbal persons
• Marked impairment in conversational skills
• Stereotyped and repetitive use of language
• Lack of spontaneous age-appropriate make-believe or social-
imitative play
 Behavior:
• Preoccupation with at least one stereotyped and restricted pattern
of interest to an abnormal degree
• Inflexible adherence to nonfunctional routines or rituals
• Repetitive motor mannerisms and preoccupation with parts of
objects
• Persistent preoccupation with parts of objects
Besides showing at least six of these symptoms, your child also needs to show
a delay in social interaction, social communication, or symbolic or imaginative
play. The DSM and diagnosticians agree that these symptoms generally must
occur before the child is 3 years old. A diagnosis of autism can occur later
(even up to old age) if it’s clear that the symptoms began before the age of 3.
After looking at the symptoms, criteria, and the vague labels attached, you
may begin to think that autism isn’t a very informative label. However, the
diagnosis is a starting point for getting treatment. Although the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) hasn’t approved any medical treatments for
autism itself, it has approved treatments for related problems that may occur,
such as irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety, vitamin deficiencies, and other
physical conditions from which autistic people frequently suffer. When you
treat those health issues, you can reduce or even eliminate many symptoms.
Seeing the signs: Autism symptoms
Professionals diagnose autism based upon symptoms shown in the categories
of social interaction, communication, and behavior (see the previous section).
We take the following sections to explain the categories of symptoms in
greater detail.
Early diagnosis and intervention — before the age of 3 — are very important,
because research shows that many features of autism respond better when
you deal with them early. Sadly, some children don’t receive an official diag-
nosis until years after their parents first suspect that something is wrong,
which means they lose valuable time. Even some doctors don’t have the nec-
essary facts to provide an accurate diagnosis. You know your child better
15
Chapter 1: Autism: The Big Picture

than any doctor, so if you disagree with a doctor’s assessment, you should
get a second opinion. Trust your instincts if you think your child isn’t devel-
oping normally. (See Chapters 4 and 6 for more on finding the right doctors
and choosing the best medication plans.)
Social development
People with autism — partly because of the problems they have with 
communication — have difficulty developing friendships and playing coopera-
tively with others. Often, kids with autism don’t imitate others’ behaviors, as
children usually do, and they don’t share their thoughts and observations. They
also don’t spontaneously try to connect with others, as other children will.
Despite the challenges children with autism face regarding social interaction,
they still have the desire to interact. Children with autism may just need
direct instruction to learn what others pick up by mere observation.
Even mildly autistic children who have normal language development (a diag-
nosis known as Asperger Syndrome, to which we devote Chapter 5) find it diffi-
cult to form peer relationships because of their problems in understanding
social protocols and others’ motivations. This social awkwardness can happen
even if a child’s IQ is off the charts. Children on this end of the autism spec-
trum display little understanding of appropriate behaviors, and they may be
criticized for being “brutally honest,” but many people note that they com-
monly lack pretension, dishonesty, flattery, and guile. However, they can also
be quite hurt by their inability to connect socially, although they may not be
able to express these emotions. Most people on this part of the spectrum lack
the emotional vocabulary.
If you’re a caregiver who wants to aid in your child’s social development, the
chapters in Part III can be of great help. If you’re an autistic adult, head to
Part IV to discover some tips on socialization.
Communication
Autistic individuals have trouble with language development, sometimes
losing speech at 18-24 months (known as regressive autism), talking only late
in development, or not talking at all. Children may repeat words and phrases
like television commercials (a condition known as echolalia), having no
apparent understanding of their meaning. The children may hear words but
not be able to make sense of what they mean.
Non-verbal communication is also impaired in children with autism.
Commonly, autistic individuals may not understand what gestures mean.
They won’t point to objects. They may not make eye contact or smile when
smiled at. Their responses or lack of responses can be isolating, resulting in
communication barriers rising between them and other people.
The chapters of Part III can take you from possible interventions to tips on
how to improve your child’s ability to communicate.

Part I: Understanding Autism 

Behavior (activities and interests)
Autistic children often have obsessions or preoccupations with objects or with
fantasy worlds (they may have trouble distinguishing fantasy from reality) that
go beyond the normal interests of a developing child. For example, a child may
play exclusively with string or believe she’s an animal. She may have trouble
transitioning from one activity to the next and insist on sticking to a ritual or
routine — even one that seems to have no meaning. Repeated mannerisms
such as hand flapping, rocking, or walking on one’s toes may become habits.
Doctors are certain that autism affects the way the brain functions (and
autopsies of autistic brains show abnormalities in different areas), causing a
sometimes distinctive set of behavioral symptoms. Each behavioral symptom
can range from mild to severe. To complicate things further, not all children
diagnosed as autistic display all the behavioral symptoms. The behavioral
symptoms govern the diagnosis, making treatment problematic.
Coexisting issues
Other conditions often coexist with autism, further complicating the diagnos-
tic and treatment picture (and researchers are still debating whether the con-
ditions are causes of autism; see Chapter 3). Some of the more common
coexisting conditions include the following:
 Mental retardation
 Hyperlexia
 Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)
 Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD)
 Dyslexia
Conditions are considered comorbid if they occur at the same time as the autis-
tic symptoms and are deemed to have roughly equal “weight” by the diagnosti-
cian. Other associative conditions such as depression are often secondary to
the autism — in other words, a person’s difficulties in interacting with the envi-
ronment and connecting with others result in a depressive disorder.
Understanding the Far-Reaching 
Impact of Autism
An autism diagnosis has a far-reaching impact in your personal community. It
affects not only the immediate family of the autistic person, but also extended
family members, schoolmates, friends, medical providers, and many others
with whom the person comes into contact. If you’re a person with autism or
the caregiver of a person with autism, you have to bear the brunt of the emo-
tional impact of the diagnosis. But don’t worry! With a positive attitude, you
17
Chapter 1: Autism: The Big Picture

can weather the storm and enjoy the calmer waters that result from greater
understanding and acceptance of how autism makes you the valued person
you are. The following sections explain how the disorder can affect different
people and how you can cope and help others cope.
How autism can affect the 
diagnosed individual
An autistic child faces large obstacles. He most likely needs (or will need) aca-
demic support in school; interventions for behavior before entering school;
and help in communicating and socially interacting with others. Autistic chil-
dren don’t pick up social cues and nonverbal language and behavior, so they
need a great deal of social support in order to make friends, interact success-
fully in social situations, and eventually become adults who can hold jobs,
relationships, and financial security. This support, combined with physical
symptoms that can be debilitating if left untreated, can make the autistic
person feel like an outsider, as if he were literally “born on the wrong planet.”
Understanding your autistic child is half the battle. The sooner he’s diag-
nosed, the better the prognosis. If you’re an autistic adult, you may have
gone through most of your life undiagnosed and feeling different or odd, but
you never quite knew why that was the case. We hope to help you under-
stand yourself better with the information and advice in this book. People
who are diagnosed today face a better future than ever before. Knowledge
about treatment options and educational interventions is expanding rapidly,
and a body of evidence on what works and what doesn’t is accumulating.
How autism can affect families, 
schools, and communities
The ripples of a child’s autism diagnosis can be felt throughout the child’s
family, the school system he attends, and the community of which he is a part.
Within the family structure, parents may have to shift many resources — time
as well as money — to focus on helping the autistic person, which may put
strains on their marriage, on work, and on their relationships with siblings.
Autism can tear families apart, as evidenced by the high divorce rate among
parents of autistic children. (We talk about relationships between autistic chil-
dren and their siblings, extended family members, and peers in Chapter 13.)
The rapid rise in diagnoses of autism in the United States (see Chapter 3) has
created an enormous challenge for schools and teachers, many of whom
aren’t trained to deal with this once-rare condition. Community services are
available in many places to help parents of autistic children, but the rise in
spending hasn’t kept up with the rise in numbers. Autistic people often
18
Part I: Understanding Autism 

require special-education services and have special health-care needs that
schools and hospitals are just learning how to manage. But, as with the diag-
nostic process, awareness is getting better. You can help by becoming an
advocate for autism. Find doctors and plans that work for your child, help
your child’s teachers learn how to give proper care and treatment, and know
your rights under the law. Parts II and III will help you greatly in these areas.
An enormous, educational consciousness-raising project on the subject of
autism is underway, and we hope to be part of it. For example, April is Autism
Awareness Month, where autism-related organizations pay special attention
to increasing awareness of the condition through conferences, articles, ral-
lies, and other means of publicity. Get involved!
How autism can affect caregivers
If you’re the parent or caregiver of a child diagnosed with autism, you have a
new job to add to your résumé. You now have to spend large amounts of time
trying to help your child. And if you have other children and a spouse, you
have to focus on your autistic child while making sure you don’t neglect
those relationships.
You’ll likely have to redefine what your child’s success in school and life will
look like. You should continue to have high standards for your child, but be
aware that progress will likely come in small steps and require hard work.
The success of many autistic people wasn’t easily achieved; success is hard-
won for both the autistic person and the parents.
And unless money is no object, the disorder can put a strain on your financial
resources, which means you may be faced with some hard decisions about
your lifestyle and priorities. You may need to put off some of your plans or be
creative with your assets until your expenses stabilize. (Head to Chapter 16
for more on money matters.)
What does all this extra work and burden mean for a parent or caregiver? It
means stress, and plenty of it. Dealing with the stress, grief, guilt, anxiety, and
pressure of caring for your autistic child and continuing to try to carry on
with day-to-day life is a challenge for all caregivers of children with autism.
For instance, the caregiver is responsible (with the help of some exceptional
physicians/healthcare providers) for
 Personal education about ASDs and other subjects that may be quite 
foreign
 Deciding which interventions to try among the myriad options
 Picking caregivers and any therapists who work with your child outside
of school
 Choosing schools and behavioral programs
19
Chapter 1: Autism: The Big Picture

 Being the case manager for your child’s healthcare
 Implementing all the choices into one treatment and education program
Meanwhile, you hope that you make the right choices. Not only do you have
the stress of many options and choices, but also you live in fear — fear that if
your child gets lost or runs away, he won’t be able to say who he is or where
he lives, for instance. And within the chaos of all these challenges, you must
try to keep a house, a family, and perhaps even a boss happy. Your marriage
may be strained like never before, and many marriages don’t make it. On the
other hand, if you work at it, you can strengthen your bond with your part-
ner, with your family, and with the child with autism. You can pull together
like you never could’ve imagined. It’s crucial that you “keep it together” and
don’t let the strain become overwhelming.
You can get a major boost and some much-needed empathy by joining a face-to-
face or an Internet-based support group, where you can meet other parents of
autistic children and share your experiences (see the Appendix for more). When
you have support, you realize that you’re not alone in your feelings and that you
can cope.
Navigating the Sea of Interventions
After a professional (or multiple professionals) makes the autism diagnosis,
the real work begins. Autistic people need much help. And because they’re so
varied in their symptoms and medical issues, they need individualized pro-
grams. Parents and others involved with their treatment and education need
to realize that an integrated approach works best to ferret out the exact issues
and work toward achieving the highest potential of each affected individual.
You’ll probably be working with more than one doctor and specialist, so you
have to act as your child’s case manager, coordinating everything that goes
on. This responsibility can be daunting, so we devote Chapter 4 to explaining
the process of medical treatment to guide caregivers through it.
Many parents elect to pay out of pocket for more experimental or cutting-
edge treatments in hopes of hitting a results gold mine. We don’t discourage
this way of thinking, but we firmly believe in fully investigating all your
options before proceeding with what can be expensive, unpredictable proce-
dures. You want to avoid jumping on every trend that comes along and bank-
rupting yourself in the process.
Whatever treatment options you decide to explore, be cautious about believ-
ing everything you hear and read — even from other parents, whose situa-
tions may be different from yours. Unfortunately, unscrupulous people will
try to make a buck on people like you. People will attempt to exploit your
concern for your child by selling you a program or remedy that probably
20
Part I: Understanding Autism 

won’t work. Be on the defensive. Just because some treatment brokered over
the Internet was the answer for one child doesn’t mean it will work for yours.
The effectiveness of the treatments you implement should be scientifically
proven and, at the very least, safe.
The following sections go into more detail about the intervention options
available to you. Be sure to find out which are covered by insurance or gov-
ernment mandates (many of them are).
One problem with using more than one intervention at a time is separating
the effects of different treatments. If a child is undergoing biomedical treat-
ments while working with educational/behavioral therapy, keeping the effects
of the treatments straight shouldn’t be a problem, because the effects of
behavioral therapies are usually slower. We suggest that if you use more than
one intervention at a time (which you probably will), make sure you make
only one change at a time. For example, avoid beginning a new diet at the
same time as starting a new educational/behavioral approach. Start with one
to determine its effect and then layer on the next.
Using behavioral, developmental, and
other educationally based interventions
Behavioral, developmental, and other educationally based interventions aim
to change a child’s behaviors by working on his communicative, cognitive,
and social skills. Existing interventions don’t cure “autism,” per se, but they
do improve its symptoms.
The following list outlines many of the intervention options available to you
today (for a complete look at these interventions, head to Chapter 9):
 Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA). ABA — sometimes called the Lovaas
method after its inventor, Dr. Ivar Lovaas — is the most common behavioral
intervention. It focuses on modifying behavior itself through a system of
rewards and (much less commonly) punishments. The process is most
often performed by trained therapists, who create a highly structured, indi-
vidualized, and systematic learning environment for the children. ABA
requires a large amount of time — at least four hours a day — to be effec-
tive. (Dr. Lovaas states that five to ten hours a week of behavioral therapy
isn’t enough to show a significant difference.)
 Floortime. This therapy is gaining wider acceptance today. Created by
Stanley Greenspan, Floortime, also known as DIR therapy (Developmental
Individual Difference Relation-Based Intervention), stresses emotional
bonding with the child and requires the parents or guardians to do most
of the therapy. Floortime concentrates on developing affection in the child
with autism and looks toward closing the developmental gaps between
where a child is and where he’s expected to be. This program is also
21
Chapter 1: Autism: The Big Picture

structured, individualized, and systematic and requires a large amount of
time to be effective (at least four hours a day).
 Miller Method. The Miller Method focuses more on cognitive develop-
ment and aims to close the developmental gaps between where a child
is and where she’s expected to be. Practitioners of the Miller Method
strive to understand the world from the child’s point of view. They
believe that every child, no matter how confused she seems, is just
trying to make sense of a confusing environment — and that it’s the
practitioner’s job to help the child. Another goal of the Miller Method is
to enable the child to make choices about her interactions with the envi-
ronment instead of being constrained by routines and rituals.
 Verbal Behavior. This is a more recent, updated version of ABA. It
stresses techniques to obtain verbalization from the child.
 TEACCH. Developed at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
the TEACCH (Treatment and Education of Autistic and Communication
Handicapped Children) approach focuses on employing other
approaches as needed to provide an environment that enables the
person with autism to be successful at using her strengths.
 Daily Life Therapy. This program, initially developed in Japan and now
also residing in Massachusetts, focuses on balancing the physical, emo-
tional, and intellectual components of a child. The program strives to
teach children with autism to successfully interact in groups and, later
on, in society.
 Relationship Development Intervention. This intervention concentrates
on helping children with autism enjoy the pleasures of sharing experi-
ences with others. Practitioners teach the children to be flexible in their
interactions with others and to develop emotional connectedness.
When choosing a program for your child, you must realize that many
approaches can be helpful — if you and the program’s practitioners imple-
ment the therapy with the needs of your child in mind, and if the practition-
ers are skilled and caring individuals. Those are two BIG ifs.
The quality of the practitioners may be the single most important variable in
your child’s progress, whether you choose ABA, TEACCH, DIR, or some pro-
gram you get off the back of a cereal box. You can find good and poor practi-
tioners of all methods, and in many cases, the methods aren’t really that
dramatically different from each other in practice.
So, you should choose a program you feel comfortable with, but make sure to
pay the most attention to who is working with your child and how the pro-
gram is tailored (or not) to him. Is the teacher flexible and sensitive to your
child’s needs, yet disciplined in approach, for example?
22
Part I: Understanding Autism 

Implementing occupational and 
speech-language therapies
People with autism are known to have difficulties in the areas of speech,
motor skills, and sensory processing. If your child has trouble with speech
and/or motor skills, you can ask for recommendations to speech-language
pathologists and occupational therapists to help your child communicate
better and improve her physical skills, including motor-coordination difficul-
ties such as trouble with balance, clapping, or holding a pen steady to write
legibly. (For more on these types of therapies, check out Chapter 10.)
Most people with autism have sensory issues they deal with. Usually, these
sensory difficulties aren’t due to any physical problems with the eyes, ears,
mouth, or nose; they occur at the level where the brain processes input. So,
the body may collect sensory information properly, but the brain doesn’t
interpret the information correctly. For instance, an autistic person may have
trouble hearing and seeing at the same time. Autistic people also can have
hypersensitive nervous systems, with senses that are so highly acute that fire
sirens or scratchy clothes are physically painful. An autistic person may seem
to withstand pain or fear better than the norm and do risky things such as
walk on high ledges because he has no fear of falling.
If your child has sensory issues, you can employ sensory integration therapy
to treat the sensory confusion that happens when some people with autism
can’t process sensory information correctly. The therapy is designed to
reduce the sensory overload by bringing your child’s sensory inputs in line.
(For more information on sensory issues, look to Chapter 10.)
Practitioners often perform sensory integration, or SI, as part of occupational
therapy or as one component of a behavioral intervention program (see the
previous section). SI includes different types of listening therapies, which view
autism as primarily stemming from a fundamental communication disorder.
Doctors today use listening therapies to treat problems such as learning dis-
abilities and AD/HD.
Medicating symptoms that 
can accompany autism
After you receive a diagnosis of autism for your child, you’ll implement a treat-
ment program that lasts until the child can function without support from that
intervention. At that point, your doctor may prescribe medications to treat
symptoms that accompany the autism disorder if needed, such as aggression,
23
Chapter 1: Autism: The Big Picture

self-injury, anxiety, OCD-like characteristics, and depression. (Medicating chil-
dren with autism is often controversial, as Chapter 6 explains.) Medication
treatment should focus on symptoms that put the person at risk of harming
himself or others or that inhibit the person’s ability to gain from other treat-
ment programming.
Medications commonly prescribed for adults and older children with autism
include the following:
 Antipsychotics, such as Risperdal
 Stimulants to treat hyperactivity, such as Ritalin
 Antidepressants, such as Prozac and Zoloft
 Antianxiety medications, such as Xanax
Although no medications can cure the underlying neurobiology of autism,
researchers are working to isolate the mechanisms in the brain that create
the difficulties experienced by autistic individuals.
Applying biomedical and 
natural interventions
A growing school of thought considers autism a biomedical disorder that can
be helped or even cured by changing the person’s diet or removing toxins
from his system and his environment. As of this writing, much anecdotal 
evidence — but little clinical evidence (the kind that doctors look for to make
judgments, and the kind the FDA uses to make regulations) — is available
that demonstrates results with some, but not all, autistic children. Clinical
evidence is minimal because researchers find it tricky — ethically as well as
logistically — to do a controlled study with autistic individuals. A controlled
study occurs when researchers test a treatment variable against a control
group that receives no treatment. Although the science has been moving for-
ward, parents don’t have the time to wait and have tried many things in
efforts to expand their options before it becomes too late for their children.
Some conventional practitioners claim that if a cure results from biomedical
interventions, the person didn’t really have autism in the first place. Because
doctors don’t have enough evidence to definitively answer the question “what
is autism” in the first place, and because we believe many people just want to
know what interventions are available for their children, we include informa-
tion on biomedical treatments in Chapter 7 and on improving your child’s
diet in Chapter 8. Many of the interventions we provide, such as supplemen-
tation or special diets, have little or no risk when implemented under the
supervision of a physician.
24
Part I: Understanding Autism 

Here are some examples of biomedical interventions, which you can combine
with behavioral interventions in an integrative approach:
 Vitamin therapy, such as B12
 Omega 3 supplementation
 Wheat-free/dairy-free (GF/CF) diet
 Chelation (removing metals, such as aluminum, from the body)

Educating and advocating
When you picked up this book, you started to
learn about autism and what it means — an
important first step. You have a great deal of
information available, and you can work to edu-
cate yourself. It may be the most rewarding and
personal learning experience you’ll ever have.
When you know enough yourself to begin help-
ing others, you’ll find that you have an important
role. You’ll be teaching others about autism
spectrum disorders and advocating for disabled
people all over the world. We’re not saying that
you need to speak at conferences or lobby your
local and state representatives (although many
parents and autistic people do). However, we’re
confident that you’ll care so much about
increasing awareness and services that you’ll
find yourself explaining autism to others who
don’t understand it. Even a task that seems as
small as making the special-education program
at your local school more responsive to autistic
needs makes you an effective advocate for your
child and for others with autism. You’ll also find
that no task is “small” in the world of autism.
You’ll run into many people who don’t get it. You
may feel the need to defend your parenting abil-
ities or your decisions. People may give you
funny or disapproving looks or make comments
if you go out in public with an autistic child 
who does something to attract attention. You
can try to explain to others about your child, or
you can decide not to let others’ erroneous
assumptions affect your peace of mind. (For
some clever responses to absurd questions,
check out Chapter 17.)
Some parents and people with autism carry
informational cards with them. These cards
often give brief explanations of autism and list
hints for interacting with autistic individuals.
Handing a card to someone (unless the person
thinks you’re selling something!) usually helps
the person to stop and reconsider his or her
thinking. For a ready-to-go version of this card,
check out the Cheat Sheet in the front of this
book.

what to expect. Maybe your child has been diagnosed recently. Perhaps
somebody close to you has a diagnosis, and you think you may have a touch
of it also. You may even be unsure that the diagnosis fits. We’re here to help
you sort all this out, no matter your situation.
Autism, as you’ll find out in this book, isn’t a terrible fate. People on the
autism spectrum have a great chance to lead fulfilling and productive lives.
With all the interventions now available, autistic people who lead successful
lives can become the rule rather than the exception. Consider the achieve-
ments of the following folks with autism: Temple Grandin (animal science
professor, cattle processing consultant), Liane Holliday Willey (presenter,
communications consultant, author), Dena Gassner (recipient of a Masters in
social work, educational advocate), Kassiane Sibley (nationally renowned
gymnast), Valerie Paradiz (author, presenter, executive director of a school
for Asperger students), Jason “J-Mac” McElwain (unexpected basketball star),
Johnny Seitz (mime, body mechanics expert), William Stillman (author, 
educational consultant), Jerry Newport (author, presenter), Jerod Poore
(Webmaster), and David Hamrick (recipient of a Masters in meteorology).
If you think you have autism, or know a person who does, you have a number
of options (in addition to reading this masterpiece, of course):
 You can read more about the autism spectrum on Web sites we list in
the Appendix to get more help.
 You can become familiar with autism literature.
 You can take the self-scoring Autism Spectrum Quotient (ASQ) test, cre-
ated by Simon Baron-Cohen, at www.wired.com/wired/archive/
9.12/aqtest.html.
The ASQ is only a screening instrument that tests for the possibility of
Asperger Syndrome in older children and adults (see Chapter 5 for more
on Asperger’s). Scoring over the threshold merely means the possibility
of an autism spectrum condition exists. For a true diagnosis and for
help, see a qualified professional (start by checking out Chapter 4).
 If your concern is for a younger child whom you fear is more severely
affected by autism, consider filling out the Miller Diagnostic Survey at
www.millermethod.org/mds. Although you must pay a $100 fee for
obtaining a report written by the senior staff at the Language and
Cognitive Development Center, the results can provide useful insights on
how to understand and help your child.
You should think of this assessment as a preliminary informative tool,
not as a substitute for a direct, personal evaluation of a child by a quali-
fied professional.

A
utistic? You can’t believe your child is autistic. Yes, he spends hours
lining up his trucks in formations, but so did you when you were 4 years
old, right? If you’ve heard of the disorder, you think of autistic children as
closed off to others, angry, nonverbal, and in possession of some kind of spe-
cial talent, like the ability to do lightning-fast calculations in his head. Your
child doesn’t fit this mental image. He seems very calm and expressive.
Even if your child doesn’t point to objects, look at you the way his sister did
at his age, or initiate conversations unless he wants something, you chalk it
up to self-sufficiency and shyness, and you consider his fascination with light
switches and toilet handles to be signs of a budding engineering talent. So
why is your doctor talking this nonsense about Pervasive Developmental
Disorders and autism spectrum disorders? And why would you put your
child in some kind of training program when he should be out playing with
his friends? Well, come to think of it, he doesn’t seem inclined to play with
other kids at all. He doesn’t seem to have any friends.
Autism is a set, or “bucket” of behavioral symptoms that fall along a contin-
uum from normal to abnormal with few dividing lines. Because science offers
no brain scan or medical test that clearly identifies specific neurological dis-
orders, diagnosis is still controversial and imprecise. Doctors base diagnosis
on behavioral symptoms, which are subject to misinterpretation and may
change over time. Symptoms can range from mild to severe.
The group of developmental disabilities we cover in this chapter is often
called the autism spectrum, and the phrase autism spectrum disorders (ASD)
may replace the term (Pervasive Developmental Disorders) PDD in the 

medical lexicon because people who support those with autism consider it
more useful. In this chapter, we outline the subtypes of the autism spectrum
and other conditions that people confuse with or that frequently occur along
with autism. We also explore the benefits of early detection and treatment.
Every child with developmental problems, no matter the terminology that
accompanies the problems — whether PDD, autistic, or autistic-like — still
needs an individualized program designed to address his or her strengths
and weaknesses. The same child may receive different diagnoses from differ-
ent doctors, although — and this is what you need to keep in mind — the
educational prescription is likely to be similar.
Surveying the Colors of Autism
Some people classify autism spectrum disorders into subtypes by their pre-
sumed causes, but because science hasn’t yet resolved the causes, this prac-
tice is controversial and not widely accepted. (More discussion about causes
appears in Chapter 3.)
You can also look at autism as a spectrum ranging from severe to light (see
Figure 2-1). Leo Kanner observed the severe end of autism when he first wrote
about the disorder in 1943, discussing children with severe challenges in com-
munication and socialization. There is a perceived homogeneity of people at
the severe end of the spectrum as depicted by the circles within the autism
spectrum severity wedge in Figure 2-1. People with high-functioning autism
(HFA) and Asperger Syndrome may be less severely affected, blending into
general society. (In this book, Asperger’s is considered part of the autism
spectrum, although its precise relationship to autism remains unestablished.)
Additionally, the notion of greater diversity of persons at the less severely
affected end of the spectrum is depicted with the largest number of different
shapes in Figure 2-1, as the condition fades into subclinical characteristics of
autism and typical society. Persons with autistic tendencies that impact their
daily lives but aren’t strong or numerous enough to warrant diagnoses are
often referred to as autistic cousins, a term reportedly developed by Kathy
Grant when talking about people with a limited number of autistic tendencies
at an Autism Network International event run by Jim Sinclair. John Ratey, MD,
author of Shadow Syndromes (Bantam) and numerous other books, considers
such people to have “shadow autism.”
For the purposes of this book, we distinguish between Asperger’s and HFA.
Some researchers include Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD)
on a broader autism spectrum because of its similarities to Asperger’s, includ-
ing the challenge of attention; others claim AD/HD is a clinically distinct disor-
der that may occur simultaneously with autism. We don’t consider AD/HD a
part of the autism spectrum in this book.
On the other hand, some researchers don’t consider Asperger Syndrome to
be autism at all; others consider it the same as high-functioning autism.
28
Part I: Understanding Autism 

Child researchers Hans Asperger and Leo Kanner both (independently)
described autism as a disorder in the 1940s, and speculation has continued
on whether they were explaining variations of autism or separate conditions
entirely.
Severe (or “classic”) autism
Sometimes referred to as Kanner’s Syndrome, severe autism is the classic type
of autism that books and films often portray to great dramatic effect. You may
also hear it called infantile autism, childhood autism, or simply autism disor-
der. Individuals with the classic type of autism may have more, and are more
heavily affected by, symptoms within the areas of communication, social devel-
opment, and activities and interests that we list in Chapter 1, or they may have
only a few obvious ones. Some of the symptoms can be so debilitating — like a
lack of functional communication — and the sensory issues so severe that the
afflicted can barely stand to remain in their own skin. Other symptoms may be
mild; a person may have good verbal communication skills but is unable to
understand pragmatics, or the meaning “between the words”.
People who are less-severely impaired by their autism are said to have high-
functioning autism (HFA) or Asperger Syndrome (see the section “Asperger
Syndrome” for more on, well, Asperger Syndrome).
Language develops late or not at all in people with Kanner’s Syndrome, which
is the main distinction between classic autism and Asperger’s, as of this 
writing. Dr. Temple Grandin, a professor of animal science at Colorado State
University who lectures and writes frequently on autism, and Kathy Grant, a
political science graduate and autism advocate who has chronicled her sen-
sory sensitivities, are some famous examples of high-functioning people with
classic autism.

PDD and PDD-NOS
Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) is the category containing autism,
Asperger Syndrome, Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise
Specified (PDD-NOS), Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, and Rett Syndrome.
PDD-NOS is a catchall diagnosis for people having most but not all the char-
acteristics of autism (see Chapter 1 for more on symptoms). People with
these disorders are often described as “autistic-like” or developmentally
delayed with autism symptoms; recently, experts have put them on the
autism spectrum.
Although classified under the Pervasive Developmental Disorders, Rett
Syndrome has identifiable physical differences such as reduced muscle tone
(causing the child to seem “floppy”) and stereotyped hand movements such
as wringing or waving. Additionally, Rett Syndrome produces an identifiable
chromosomal difference.

Part I: Understanding Autism 
More than a misunderstood memo
As an instructor of autism spectrum disorders
at Antioch College and in special education
courses, much of my (author Stephen Shore’s)
understanding of social situations and office
politics remains academic.
In my book Beyond the Wall: My Experiences
with Autism and Asperger Syndrome (Autism
Asperger Publishing Company), I write of send-
ing a memo to a dean, quoting a department
chairman word for word, with an innocent intent
to lay everything about a situation on the table
without considering others’ reactions. The
memo was passed on and misconstrued as dis-
paraging toward the man, who I describe as an
admired mentor.
It had never occurred to me that whatever I
wrote to my dean would be repeated verbatim
to somebody else and misinterpreted. The
lesson for me is that I must write all memos as
if anyone in the entire college may read them,
and if I see a possibility that someone may look
bad, I need to take special pains to prevent it.
What’s the big deal, you ask? Anybody could
make such a mistake — sending a memo that
others misinterpret. But I think it goes further
than being the stereotypical bookish, absent-
minded professor. I have significant trouble
remembering my students’ faces, yet my senses
are so sharp that I find shaving painful and
threadbare socks — even when worn by 
others — profoundly upsetting.
Though I was initially diagnosed as a toddler as
having “atypical development with strong autis-
tic tendencies,” my parents disregarded profes-
sional advice for institutionalization. With much
support from my parents, teachers, and others, I
was able to transcend others’ low expectations,
which is what I encourage others with autism to
achieve. At one time considered classically
autistic, I’m now thought of as an individual with
Asperger Syndrome, or mild autism. I attribute
many successful interpersonal situations I
encounter to the assistance of outside interpre-
tation from my wife and others, enabling me to
have what I feel is a productive and fulfilling
career.

People with PDD-NOS need some special services but don’t fit the behavioral
criteria for any of the other categories of autism. Maybe the person lacks mean-
ingful speech or has stereotypical movements such as hand flapping or rock-
ing, but he or she doesn’t have enough of the symptoms to fill the symptom
bucket and be considered autistic. This lack of a label may make it tougher to
get services, because the autism label — although considered stigmatizing by
some people — does generally get you educational services in most places
(see Part III for more on autism and education).
Because autism is a spectrum disorder without a clear dividing line, some
people fall just on the other side of the line — they don’t qualify for autism
disorder because of late onset of symptoms, or they don’t have enough
behavioral symptoms. However, their disorder significantly impacts daily
functioning on a regular basis.
Asperger Syndrome
Individuals with Asperger Syndrome range from people who may be consid-
ered a little eccentric to people who have serious difficulties socially, educa-
tionally, and professionally because they lack basic understanding of human
interactions. People in the latter group often have to learn by rote things 
that other people consider common sense, such as how to read facial expres-
sions, tones of voice (like sarcasm), and verbal expressions (such as “raining
cats and dogs”).
Many people with Asperger’s have brilliant intellects yet are naïve and easily
taken advantage of by others because they interpret situations at face value
and miss social cues. Generally, “Aspies” lack common emotional responses
and must learn appropriate social skills to function within society, but they’re
typically considered high functioning and may never be diagnosed at all. No
obvious language delay comes with Asperger Syndrome; however, language
tends to develop in a unique manner. Professionals dispute whether
Asperger’s should even be considered a disorder. People affected don’t show
the same delays in cognitive development or curiosity about their environ-
ment that people with classic autism do in childhood.
One well-known person with Asperger Syndrome is Liane Holliday Willey — a
doctor of education, a writer, and a researcher — who realized she had the syn-
drome only after her daughter received a diagnosis. In her book, Pretending to
be Normal: Living with Asperger’s Syndrome (Jessica Kingsley Publishers),
Willey explains how an undiagnosed individual often feels different from others
but doesn’t know why. The person doesn’t seek a cure, only acceptance. “No
matter what the hardships,” Willey writes, “I do not wish for a cure to Asperger
Syndrome. What I wish for is a cure for the common ill that pervades too many
lives; the ill that makes people compare themselves to a normal that is mea-
sured in terms of perfect and absolute standards, most of which are impossible
for anyone to reach.”

Chapter 2: From Classification to Treatment: Scanning the Autism Spectrum

Co-author Stephen Shore was once considered uneducable, but he has writ-
ten poignantly about his struggles to understand social protocols that others
take for granted (see the sidebar “More than a misunderstood memo” earlier
in this chapter). Now considered to have Asperger Syndrome, Shore has writ-
ten two other books and numerous articles, and he consults and presents
internationally in addition to his work on this book.
You must understand that people with Asperger’s don’t lack feelings; their
brains just function in such a way that they have trouble accessing and
expressing feelings to others in a traditional manner. Chapter 5 describes
how Asperger’s relates to the autism spectrum.
Considering Conditions 
That Resemble Autism
Because doctors can’t definitively, precisely diagnose autism, they encounter
several other conditions and symptoms that tend to enter the diagnostic mix.
This mixture makes awareness of conditions with related or similar symptoms
important. The following sections outline such conditions and symptoms.
If a doctor diagnoses a child with some variant of autism spectrum disorder,
such as PDD-NOS (see the previous section), the need for immediate inter-
vention is the same. Such a diagnosis means that the child doesn’t fit the clin-
ical criteria for an autism diagnosis, and it doesn’t address the severity of the
symptoms that are present. You know whether or not your child needs help.
Find out what help is available, get what your child needs, and don’t sweat
the diagnosis.
Childhood Disintegrative Disorder
Although not much is known about Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, children
with this condition develop normally until they reach 3 to 4 years of age
(rarely do children show change later than this, although some children
develop this disorder as late as 10 years). At that point, they undergo a quick
regression (faster than children with regressive-onset autism), usually losing
all language ability and in some cases losing bowel and bladder control. In a
show of other symptoms, the children can have epileptic seizures (Temple
Grandin, a professor and writer living with autism, calls the children regres-
sive epileptics), for which anticonvulsive drugs are often helpful, and motor
disorders, probably caused by acute sensory processing problems.
The National Institute of Health considers Childhood Disintegrative Disorder
part of the grouping of Pervasive Developmental Disorders (www.nimh.nih.
gov/publicat/autism.cfm), but the federal Centers for Disease Control
32
Part I: Understanding Autism 

and Prevention disagrees. At any rate, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder is
quite rare, and because they experience such a late onset of symptoms, these
children require a very thorough medical workup. However, the individual
treatment for these kids can be almost identical to treatment of autism.
Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
Many children who exhibit more severe cases of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity
Disorder, or AD/HD, often share many of the characteristics and features with
children at the high-functioning/Asperger’s end of the autism spectrum —
particularly in the areas of communication, social integration, and behavior.
Some children get diagnosed with one of the disorders and then receive the
other diagnosis at a later time.
Symptoms for both autism and AD/HD include problems with organization,
sensory issues, attention, and social skills. However, the delay in acquiring
language that occurs with more severe autism isn’t consistent with AD/HD.
Diane Kennedy has three sons who have disabilities — one of whom was mis-
diagnosed with AD/HD rather than Asperger Syndrome — and she writes about
how this happened in her book, The ADHD-Autism Connection: A Step Toward
More Accurate Diagnoses and Effective Treatments (WaterBrook Press). If you
think your child may be misdiagnosed, we recommend this book highly.
The lesson you (and doctors) should keep in mind is that the two disorders
are frequently confused because of their overlapping behavioral symptoms.
Also, hyperactivity doesn’t always equal AD/HD. It can be part of many other
childhood developmental problems.
The implication for parents is to know your child well and to make sure you
get a second opinion with your child’s diagnosis. AD/HD in schools is treated
differently than autism: Although the disorder is considered a disability
under the Americans with Disabilities Act, schools usually offer a different 
set of accommodations than they do for children on the autism spectrum.
Other possible diagnoses
Science has come a long way from the time when autism was confused with
deafness or mental retardation, but not that far. Don’t misunderstand: Some
of the alternative diagnoses may be correct; that is, they may be present in
addition to autism. However, a diagnosis of autism may better explain a
person’s symptoms than any of the psychological categories he or she can
fall into when autism isn’t a suspect.
33
Chapter 2: From Classification to Treatment: Scanning the Autism Spectrum

Sometimes people who are aggressive or seem resistant to authority are
given a psychological diagnosis such as oppositional defiant disorder, con-
duct disorder, or borderline personality disorder. Bipolar disorder and
depression are other diagnoses sometimes given to people who should be
diagnosed with autism, which does lend itself to mood disorders. Obsessive
compulsive disorder is also easily diagnosed in autistic children. A child may
have any of these disorders in addition to autism, but autism should be con-
sidered the primary problem. You should press your doctors to investigate
further if you aren’t satisfied with the diagnosis or if your child doesn’t
improve after some rounds of medication.
Other syndromes that may look a bit like autism, but definitely aren’t autism,
include the following (Note: Some of these syndromes may occur with autism
or be mistaken for autism; people can have more than one disorder at a time):
 Cornelia DeLange Syndrome
 Tourette’s Syndrome
 Fragile X Syndrome
 William’s Syndrome

Part I: Understanding Autism 
If a child has “autistic tendencies” . . .
Jake was diagnosed as “developmentally dis-
abled with autistic tendencies” at the age of 3, but
his parents weren’t satisfied with the diagnosis.
His mother said she “ran from the autism label
like the plague.” Jake could recite videos and
music lyrics, but he never expressed any of his
own thoughts to his parents. (Many autistic chil-
dren repeat phrases or words they hear often,
such as television commercials, but they don’t
necessarily understand what they’re saying. They
can hear and repeat the words, but they can’t
process them. This is called echolalia.) And
although he could identify letters of the alphabet
at age 2 and work the microwave oven and com-
puter at 3, Jake never initiated conversations or
used language in a functional way — to express
a meaningful request, for instance.
Jake’s parents consulted with experts and
decided to treat his condition as mainly sensory
integration disorder, which means his brain has
trouble organizing and making sense of sensory
input from his environment. He was provided with
auditory stimulation and sensory integration ther-
apies (which we discuss in Chapter 10). After the
first two weeks, his language began to blossom,
and two years later, Jacob was speaking fluently
and asking questions of his parents.
Every child won’t respond to such treatment in
the same way, but many parents are trying
alternative therapies, with mixed success. The
point is that doctors are applying a range of dif-
ferent diagnoses to the growing population of
developmentally disabled kids, and a diagnosis
of autistic tendencies may be given to a child
who could just as easily receive an autism diag-
nosis. Jake’s parents admit that they would’ve
qualified for more financial assistance from
their state had they accepted the autism diag-
nosis, yet they chose not to.

Understanding Why Early Treatment
Matters More than Classification
What an alphabet soup of diagnostic labels boils down to is that you need to
worry more about actually understanding and treating a child’s condition than
about the clinical labels he or she gets stuck with. The previous sections in
this chapter spend time outlining the subtypes and related disorders because
the labels can be useful in some ways, but we don’t want to focus solely on
labels. The following sections stress the importance of early identification of
problems, getting the best medical care available to you, and finding programs
that can help children prosper with their conditions.
Despite the need to get past labels, you should recognize that a label is still
very important for two reasons:
 The label is often the ticket to school, community, and medical services.
 Accepting the label given to the person you care for means that you’ve
achieved an important milestone: You recognize that help is needed —
and is on the way.
Attempting early identification 
and intervention
Researchers are able to identify symptoms of autism at younger ages, such as
at 18 months, than ever before, a development that leads toward more empha-
sis on early treatment, simply because that time frame is where children can
usually make the greatest gains. Pediatricians are now looking for potential
markers, such as a larger head, and giving screening questionnaires to parents
to identify early symptoms such as unusual eye contact and ability to follow a
point. Also, autism experts are pressing pediatricians to use more direct obser-
vation to detect possible social clues, such as atypical vocalizations, including
echolalia (the repetition of sounds and words from the environment; see the
sidebar “‘If a child has “autistic tendencies’ . . .”). Other differences experts are
pressing pediatricians to look for include
 A lack of joint attention
 A resistance to being held
 An appearance of deafness to words
35
Chapter 2: From Classification to Treatment: Scanning the Autism Spectrum

The best thing you can do for your child — whether you think he or she’s autis-
tic or not — is to start an educational/behavioral program early to help with
his or her communication deficits (for more on programs, see Chapter 9). And
make sure your child gets medical help for any physical symptoms, such as
digestive problems, he or she may experience. That’s the bottom line.
According to Peter Mundy, a professor of psychology at the University of
Miami, a social marker known as joint attention or gaze following, which neuro-
typical babies begin doing in the first 15 months of life, is impaired in autistic
babies. Autistic babies don’t follow or initiate eye contact in order to share an
experience with a caregiver; they initiate eye contact for “instrumental pur-
poses,” which means to get something they need, such as food. Impaired joint
attention can be a lifelong trait in autistic people, but Mundy says that if
experts train doctors and parents to notice the trait earlier, caregivers may be
able to identify and help children at risk as early as infancy.
Many professionals share a widespread agreement that social disengagement
is what separates autism from other disorders. Children diagnosed with devel-
opmental disabilities share a common problem: They need help in communi-
cating and developing social skills. Parents and other caregivers can teach
these skills, and the sooner the better, because children’s brains develop
rapidly. So, whether your child is autistic or not, he or she still needs help,
and you can focus on that.
We don’t mean to imply that a diagnosis is unimportant, because it influences
treatment, but in many cases where children are diagnosed as being on the
autism spectrum, treatment is similar. And treatments that work for some chil-
dren won’t have any effect with others who have identical medical diagnoses.
Diagnoses and prognoses based on behavioral symptoms can and do 
change, as the stories of people such as Temple Grandin — an accomplished
professor — and co-author Shore surely prove. Many people with autism
have been misdiagnosed as having mental retardation, schizophrenia, AD/HD,
and other conditions (see the section “Considering Conditions that Resemble
Autism” for more).
Getting good medical care
People with autism require good medical care, both in diagnosis and in treat-
ment. The proper medical care can help your child fulfill his or her potential
and live a full and healthy life. But how do you know which doctor to trust?
Credentials, although important, don’t guarantee skill or insight in a profes-
sional. You need to have your child evaluated by more than one doctor.
Experts in one particular disorder are likely to see every child through that
diagnostic lens.
36
Part I: Understanding Autism 

Although many treatments are changing as doctors diagnose many new cases
of autism, and the medical profession and the public are more aware today,
keep in mind that most parents of autistic children see the disorder before
the pediatrician does. In fact, in many cases, parents see something years
before doctors formally diagnose it. You know your child’s behavior and his-
tory better than anyone. You need to communicate to professionals what
problems you think she’s having that impair her the most. You want your
child to be helped, not just diagnosed. Don’t allow anyone to dismiss your
concerns arbitrarily. The sooner you get help, the better.
We know of one set of parents who found out about the diagnosis for their
son, Jeffrey, by receiving a booklet and being told in hushed tones, “I’m sorry.”
That’s a sorry way to deal with the issue. Jeff, now 7, can read at a higher level
than grade level. He’s exceeding everybody’s expectations, and his parents
have become active advocates in the autism community, partly because of the
disappointing treatment they received from their first doctor.
If you think your doctor isn’t taking your concerns seriously enough, you
need to find a specialist and get more input. Many pediatricians don’t have
the training to screen for autism because they perceive it as rare and don’t
have experience with it. (You can find additional medical information in
Chapter 4.)
Enrolling in effective early programs
Experts recommend enrolling children who show symptoms of autism in edu-
cational/behavioral programs as soon as parents and professionals identify
the symptoms. Sometimes the school system is the first in line to refer the
child for diagnosis, but you must remember that autism is a medical diagno-
sis, not an educational one.
Teaching credentials don’t qualify a person to diagnose autism or other med-
ical conditions. However, given that teachers are professionals familiar with
many children, they can be very helpful in recommending an evaluation for
children who they think may have trouble learning in traditional classrooms.
So, if a teacher or school psychologist tells you that he or she believes your
child may be autistic, you need to see a qualified professional.
A school psychologist, depending on the state and the individual’s creden-
tials or license, can diagnose a child (known as an educational diagnosis). A
school can identify and label a child with autism for purposes of providing
special services within the school setting. This label may or may not qualify
an individual for community-based special services outside the school set-
ting. The opposite is also true: If a doctor diagnoses a child with autism out-
side the school setting, the school is required to conduct an evaluation to
determine what services are required by that individual child. The school
isn’t required, however, to provide a blanket set of services that the child
may not even need.
37
Chapter 2: From Classification to Treatment: Scanning the Autism Spectrum

Educational/behavioral interventions, which we discuss in detail in Chapter 9,
are intensive, structured programs where a parent or a trained therapist
works with a child to systematically teach behavior and communication
skills. Most programs are based on behavior modification principles; some
programs teach parents to work with their autistic children; and other pro-
grams are held in preschools that target play and communicative skills.
Some things to look for in a program include the following:
 Individualized attention paid to each child
 Broad-based curriculum that supports social interaction, play, and 
communication
 Systematic teaching that emphasizes outcomes (what the child should
know and do)
 Family participation being encouraged by the facilitators
 A focus on functional skills (learning that has a purpose in the world)
Preschool-aged children can benefit greatly from a good early intervention pro-
gram, and many states cover the costs under federal guidelines. Chapter 12
includes the educational rights of autistic individuals under federal legislation.
With increasing diagnoses and knowledge, laws (and the funding for imple-
menting them) are changing rapidly.

Where Does Autism Come From?

M
any things about autism remain unknown — including what every
parent wants to know upon hearing a diagnosis: the causes of the dis-
order. We say “causes” rather than “cause” because it’s possible — although
not definite — that autism has several triggers. Research is still in the early
stages, and the complexity of the condition means that scientists can draw
very few definite conclusions. As of this writing, researchers have data that
suggests correlations — or factors that are related to having autism — rather
than data that suggests causation — or factors that would cause autism. The
good news is that the U.S. government has increased funding substantially in
recent times. The National Institute of Health now spends close to a billion
dollars annually on autism research, up from $22 million as recently as 1997.
Because researchers have identified different types of autism, with different
symptoms, they don’t believe one theory on the causes will fit all types.
Some autistic disorders may be environmental, and some may be entirely
genetic. We just don’t know. In the absence of any categorical answer for the
question of autism’s causes, researchers are proposing and debunking theo-
ries while they continue to study genetic and environmental factors that may
help fill in pieces of the puzzle. In this chapter, we talk about what theories
researchers have advanced and why. We also discuss the rising number of
diagnoses of autism and what a cure would mean to people who have autism.

Although researchers will find a major cause for autism at some point — and
many people think they’ve already found causes — that cause may not apply
to everyone who has autism. So, bear this in mind: It isn’t your fault. Your
child was born with the genetic predisposition. It has become clear that
autism is a neurobiological disorder with genetic roots — parenting has noth-
ing to do with it. The best thing a wise parent can do is to keep current with
interventions (see Chapter 9) and be cautious about where you put your
money (see Chapter 16 for more on money matters).
Considering the Rise in Diagnoses
When the medical profession first diagnosed autism in the 1940s, the rate
was considered to be between 1 and 4 out of 10,000 people. Since then —
especially since the 1980s — science has seen a dramatic increase in the
number of people with autism. According to the Centers for Disease Control
in Atlanta, the incidence of autism spectrum disorders is 1 in 166 American
children. (Autism appears in every industrialized country at roughly the
same frequency. Researchers don’t have good data on its incidence in devel-
oping countries, because the reporting and medical systems in these coun-
tries aren’t fully functioning in many cases. However, many epidemiologists
believe that the rates in these countries are likely similar.)
Some people contend that the population of autism has seen no real increase;
they believe the numbers only indicate more accuracy in diagnosis. For
instance, they say people who would’ve been diagnosed with mental retarda-
tion in the past now receive a proper diagnosis of autism. Also, they make the
point that increased awareness of autism has led to more diagnoses in people
considered borderline cases, such as those with Asperger Syndrome (see
Chapter 5).
It appears from research, however, that even after professionals began con-
trolling for better diagnoses and awareness of autism, they’ve seen an
increase in cases of autism — not Asperger Syndrome — that they can’t
explain. This increase has led to great debate regarding the possible triggers.
The reality of the increased incidence is probably somewhere between
greater awareness and better diagnostic tools, with some of the increase
resulting from inappropriate autism labeling in pursuit of better educational
services.
40
Part I: Understanding Autism 

Exploring the Genetic Link
Researchers believe that a genetic component or predisposition is present in
the majority of people who develop autism spectrum disorders. They point
to irregular segments of genetic code as the culprits for some autism cases.
A genetic predisposition, however, doesn’t dictate what may develop. A pre-
disposition isn’t the same as a cause. A person can have a genetic predisposi-
tion to heart disease or cancer but avoid it by living a careful lifestyle.
Genetics doesn’t equal destiny. Unfortunately, a person can have a genetic
predisposition, lead a healthy lifestyle, and still develop a disorder. The follow-
ing sections explore the connections between genetics and autism.
Familial patterns
Research has found that autism clusters in families. The federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (www.cdc.gov) has data showing the follow-
ing diagnosis rates among family members:
 Identical twins, who have the same genetic makeup, have about a 75-
percent concordance rate (meaning that both twins have autism).
 Fraternal (nonidentical) twins have a 3-percent concordance rate.
 The risk of autism in normal siblings ranges from 2 to 8 percent.
 Among families that contain diagnoses of autism, research shows a 10-
to 40-percent increase in the diagnoses of other developmental dis-
abilities, such as language delays and learning disabilities.
Researchers have concluded that families that carry autism genes also carry
other conditions in members who don’t necessarily have autism. The inheri-
tance pattern for autism spectrum disorders is complex and suggests that
mutations in a number of different genes (at least 10) may be involved,
according to some research. That explains what Temple Grandin, an author
and professor who has autism, calls the “highly variable nature” of autism.
Craig Newschaffer at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine estimates that 
60 to 90 percent of all autism cases are genetically based. However, because
of the complex nature of autism genetics, scientists don’t have a test parents
can order to see if their children are at an increased risk of developing the
disorder.
41
Chapter 3: Causes, Clusters, and Clues: Where Does Autism Come From?

Autism also tends to occur more frequently among individuals who have cer-
tain inherited medical conditions, including Fragile X syndrome, tuberous
sclerosis, congenital rubella syndrome, and untreated phenylketonuria
(PKU). (See Chapter 4 for more on diagnosing related medical conditions.)
Brain size and structure
Little is known about the etiology, or origins, of autism. Science has no test
for it. But brain scans and other types of research have identified differences
in the shape and structure of the brains — particularly in the frontal lobes —
of autistic people, including those with Asperger Syndrome. Researchers are
scanning DNA to try to put the genetic puzzle together and develop treatments,
diagnostic screening tools, and tests that will help identify autism earlier.
Researchers haven’t ruled out problems in pregnancy and delivery. Maybe
the child gets exposed to neurotoxins (brain cell–destroying substances)
such as mercury from contaminated fish, for instance, or experiences
damage during the delivery process. These so-called environmental insults,
or traumas, can interact with genetics to result in autism (see the section
“Examining Biomedical Theories” later in this chapter for more on environ-
mental factors).
For a picture of the human brain and the areas we mention in the following

Part I: Understanding Autism 

Initial clues about the brain
An abnormality in brain size and structure (along with functioning) is the gen-
eral consensus for what causes autism, yet researchers don’t know exactly
which kinds of abnormalities they can attribute to genetics. Researchers at
the Autism Tissue Program in Princeton, N.J. (www.brainbank.org), which
studies donated brain tissue to understand autistic behaviors, say the cause
of spectrum disorders could be innate genetic anomalies or environmental
insults, or trauma. Research has found abnormalities in the brains of autistic
individuals, namely in several neurotransmitter systems (neurotransmitters
are the chemical messengers of the brain).
Researchers have found a larger overall brain size (or volume) in autistic 
children 12 and younger, although the parietal lobes — associated with move-
ment, orientation, recognition, and perception of stimuli — are smaller than
normal. The brain is actually often heavier in young children with autism.
Also, the amygdala and the hippocampus, the memory center, are larger in
autistic children but are the same size or smaller in adolescents and adults. It
seems, however, that the connections are missing or not working correctly
when the brain tries to process information between different local systems.
Imagine that you can call your aunt in the next county, but when you try to
call long distance, you can’t get a line. This gives you a small taste of what
autistic people must deal with.
An overgrowth of nerve connections in the brain, according to one theory,
may cause the brain to become overwhelmed with neurotransmitter signals.
This theory is consistent with research studies that have found that autistic
babies’ heads may grow faster than normal at various points. Why would this
overgrowth occur? The normal cell “pruning” process of the fetus doesn’t
occur, and too many neurons exist.
How does autism develop?
Why would genetic abnormalities of the brain lead to autism? This isn’t well
understood, and researchers have different theories. Some researchers think
of autism as a disorder of brain-circuit dysfunction. Researcher Eric Courchesne
from the University of California found abnormal growth in the frontal cortexes
of autistic brains; he deduced that the only normally functioning parts of the
autistic brain are the visual cortex and the areas in the back of the brain that
store memories. The frontal cortex is involved with sensory interpretation,
which may explain why the visual cortex (responsible for visual perception)
functions normally, yet autistic people seem to have visual processing
(understanding what they see) issues.
Dr. Margaret Bauman, a pediatric neurologist and director of the LADDERS
Clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital (www.ladders.org), believes that
the structural problems of the autistic brain are primarily in the limbic
system, which includes the amygdala (the emotion center) and the cerebel-
lum, which is associated with the regulation and coordination of movement,
posture, and balance. The cerebellum’s involvement with a person’s motor
43
Chapter 3: Causes, Clusters, and Clues: Where Does Autism Come From?

function could also explain the poor motor skills that individuals on the
autism spectrum often display.
John Ratey, MD, author of The User’s Guide to the Brain (Vintage Books) and
professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, writes that many autistic
persons have eye-movement and hearing difficulties and facial-nerve palsy
consistent with brainstem injury during their mothers’ first trimester of 
pregnancy.
Other studies show increased cerebellum size, but increased by the same
proportion as the brain as a whole. One study, conducted by Aylward,
Minshew, and others found that the cerebrum (and other specific structures)
was abnormally large in relation to the size of the brain as a whole.
Some parts of the brain work really well in certain autistic individuals, how-
ever. Temple Grandin, an author and professor who has autism, is one exam-
ple. She has something akin to a videocamera in her head, allowing her to
replay images and examine their details. Yet, she feels that other parts of her
brain are underdeveloped. For example, she was never able to learn algebra
because she couldn’t visualize the concepts.
The brain-gut connection
Some researchers have focused on what they call the “second brain”: the gut.
The nervous system of the upper gastrointestinal, or GI, tract is extremely
complex, and not much is known about how it interacts with the brain. This
brain/gut connection is the focus of neurogastroenterology.
Dr. Jill James, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Arkansas, and Dr.
Richard Deth, a Northeastern University neuropharmacologist, have con-
ducted a preliminary study that found autistic children have great difficulty
with what scientists call the methylation process.
Methylation is a metabolic process of making a molecule longer by adding a
carbon. It’s necessary for regulating DNA synthesis and enzymes, building
neurotransmitters, synchronizing neurons, and to make cellular energy (see
Chapter 7 for more on the process).
James’s and Deth’s work has been interpreted as follows: The faulty methyla-
tion process means that autistic people can’t eliminate heavy metals such as
aluminum, cadmium, lead, and mercury from their systems. Some
researchers believe these metals lead to the symptoms of autism (you can
get more detail on the heavy metals in the section “Heavy-metal poisoning
hypotheses” later in this chapter).
44
Part I: Understanding Autism 

Problems with methylation may be genetic or environmentally induced (see
the section “Examining Biomedical Theories” for more on this), or they may
occur through an interaction between genetics and the environment. Such
findings are preliminary and require further research.
The testosterone link
A theory proposed by a British researcher, Simon Baron-Cohen, explains
autism as the result of right-brain dominance, a pattern typically seen in
males. He theorizes that too much testosterone in utero leads to the symp-
toms of autism. Autism, in this theory, is simply being “too male.”
Baron-Cohen’s research shows that fetuses producing high levels of testos-
terone may have a higher chance of developing autism. And it seems to be
consistent with the fact that autistic boys outnumber autistic girls.
Baron-Cohen believes that the human brain specializes either in empathy
(being able to appreciate and understand the emotions of others) or in
understanding systems (being able to manipulate data). The former is an E-
type brain, and the latter is an S-type brain, and he says that most boys have
the S-type brain.
When studying the relationship between empathy and autism, Baron-Cohen
found that children who experienced high-prenatal testosterone levels make
less eye contact as toddlers and have lower communication skills at age 4,
although he concedes that the necessary evidence to prove his theory isn’t
available. Other researchers have also criticized his work as playing upon
stereotypes of girls as good with people and boys as good with objects.
Those stereotypes may have some biological basis, but many exceptions to
this generalization exist. Another problem with this research is that Baron-
Cohen’s paradigm doesn’t explain all the symptoms of autism.
Examining Biomedical Theories
Researchers suggest that several distinct autistic subtypes exist that differ
not necessarily in their symptoms and presentation, but in their causes.
Some scientists believe that environmental factors (sometimes coupled with
genetic factors) may explain what causes autism and the increase in autism
diagnoses. They say that genetic factors alone can’t be sufficient for the
number of cases seen today; thus, a search for environmental triggers that
cause autism in genetically susceptible individuals is underway.
45
Chapter 3: Causes, Clusters, and Clues: Where Does Autism Come From?

In this section, we discuss theories involving allergies or food intolerances,
heavy-metal poisoning, and autoimmune responses and triggers. Researchers
are currently investigating all the theories, which means that none of them
have enough supporting evidence to say they’ve been proven correct as of
this writing. The problem (which we explain in the upcoming sidebar) is
establishing that causation is taking place, not simply correlation. None of
the previously conducted research has been able to determine if the brain
differences, the poor elimination of toxins, the poor processing of proteins,
and any of the other issues are causes or simply results of the autism.
What do allergies have to do with it?
The type of allergy that plays a role in autism is different than the allergies
most people are aware of, such as reactions to bee stings. The kind of allergy
associated with autism doesn’t show up immediately; thus, you can more
accurately refer to these allergies as intolerances to substances (as we dis-
cuss in Chapter 8). Many autistic individuals are intolerant of dairy products
or other common foods such as eggs. Some people believe that these intoler-
ances wreak such havoc with the brain that they actually cause autism.
Others argue that anyone who’s cured of autistic symptoms by reduced expo-
sure to allergens was never autistic in the first place. Researchers have the
proverbial chicken and egg problem here.
One theory, the cerebral allergy theory, points to how some intolerances are
common across most of the autism spectrum. The theory states that the
stomachs of some autistic people lack the enzymes needed to digest some
proteins, and that these proteins cause harm to their brains by migrating into

Keeping elephants away: A correlation study
Here’s an elephant joke I (co-author Stephen
Shore) like to tell my statistics students while
we’re studying correlation:
I’ve been riding the 66 bus for the past five
years. On most of my trips, I like to throw small
pieces of tissue out the window along the way.
Finally, another fellow who regularly rides the
same bus asked with great curiosity, “Why do
you keep throwing paper out the window?” I
told him that I have a great fear of elephants. 
He looked at me strangely and commented that
little pieces of paper wouldn’t keep them away.
“They sure do,” I said. “I haven’t seen an ele-
phant in any of my five years of travel on this
bus!” The correlation between my littering the
street with paper and the lack of elephants in
downtown Boston doesn’t illustrate, however,
whether my actions cause the elephants to stay
away. Autism researchers face a similar corre-
lation problem. Do the conditions autistic people
have cause the autism, or are they simply
results of the autism?

their bloodstreams (via leaky guts; see Chapter 7); the proteins may also
cause the diarrhea or constipation common in autistic children. According to
the Autism Society of America’s “Statement on Dietary Interventions,”
research has found “elevated levels of certain peptides” in the urine of autis-
tic children. The ASA also says the following:
“The incomplete breakdown and the excessive absorption of peptides
may cause disruption in biochemical and neuroregulatory processes in
the brain, affecting brain functions. Until there is more information as to
why these proteins are not broken down, the removal of proteins from
the diet is the only way to prevent further neurological and gastrointestinal
damage.”
Some parents who remove dairy products (containing casein) or wheat prod-
ucts (containing gluten), which are structurally similar proteins, report
improvements in digestion, mood, and sleep. (For more on diet and what you
can do to help, see Chapter 8.) Some parents have claimed cures for their
children through dietary and other interventions.
The maldigestion of dietary proteins theory also carries the label opioid pep-
tide theory, because it seems that these proteins can act like opiates, or
painkillers, in the systems of people who can’t digest them.
Heavy-metal poisoning hypotheses
If a child has too much metal in his or her system, it may be genetic or envi-
ronmentally induced, or it may occur through an interaction between genet-
ics and the environment. The problem is significant because high levels of
these metals can disrupt the brain and the nervous system, resulting in autis-
tic symptoms. Research done by neuropharmacologist Dr. Richard Deth, of
Northeastern University, among others, is consistent with a heavy-metal theory
of autism (not the title of a bad hair band from the 1980s, we promise). With
this hypothesis, researchers state that a metal such as mercury or lead can
cause neurodevelopmental disorders in a subset of susceptible children who
lack the genetic ability to excrete heavy metals from their systems.
Some potential sources of mercury or other metals harmful to the body
include the following:
 Dental amalgams or fillings
 Fish, such as tuna
 Power-plant emissions
 Lead-based paint
47
Chapter 3: Causes, Clusters, and Clues: Where Does Autism Come From?

 Cigarette smoke
 Well or tap water
 Vaccines
 Swimming pools and hot tubs treated with copper sulfate
Some autistic children have been shown to have, when tested, excessively
high levels of metals in their systems, although research has not yet estab-
lished this as fact. Most healthy bodies excrete metals, but researchers have
theorized that autistic children have great difficulty excreting them because
of lower rates of glutathione and other proteins that work to eliminate metals
such as aluminum, cadmium, lead, and mercury. (See Chapter 7 for a discus-
sion of chelation, or the removal of heavy metals, a controversial step that
some parents are taking to protect their children.)
48
Part I: Understanding Autism 
The vaccination controversy
Research has provided two theories about vac-
cines and their role in autism. The first relates to
the role of thimerosal, a mercury-based preser-
vative that used to come in a number of vaccines
as well as contact-lens solutions. The second
theory deals with a possible bad-interaction
effect between the components of the Measles,
Mumps, Rubella (MMR) vaccination, which is a
live vaccination that doesn’t contain thimerosal,
and the presence of residual measles in the
digestive tract (see the section “Autoimmune or
virus-induced theories of causation”).
These theories have been advanced to attempt
to explain the regressive form of autism.
Between 18 to 24 months is when most children
with regressive autism begin showing symptoms,
which is the same period of time when children
receive many vaccinations, resulting in a high
correlation between that period of time and the
onset of autistic tendencies. However, correla-
tion isn’t causation (as we explain in the sidebar
“Keeping elephants away: A correlation study”).
The debate about thimerosal is ongoing,
although the National Academies’ Institute of
Medicine in Washington, D.C., has stated that it
has found no conclusive evidence to implicate
thimerosal in vaccines. Yet, some researchers,
many parents, and the Autism Society of
America (ASA) don’t believe that professionals
have done enough research to completely rule
out damage. The ASA issued a statement
saying that “Large-scale, epidemiological stud-
ies, which do not prove cause and effect,
cannot appropriately answer the question at
hand.” The epidemiological studies used to dis-
prove the theory, the society argues, didn’t take
into account that only a small subset of a popu-
lation may be genetically susceptible to devel-
oping autism.
In any case, you may want to reconsider your
child’s vaccination schedule. According to
Stephanie Cave, who wrote What Your Doctor
May Not Tell You About Children’s Vaccinations
(Warner Books), a child in the United States now
receives up to 33 shots by the age of 5. In some
cases, a 15-month-old child may get as many as
half a dozen shots in a single medical visit. Cave
doesn’t advocate eliminating the vaccination of
children. Rather, she makes recommendations
for safer vaccinations by adjusting the adminis-
tration schedule to allow the children’s immuno-
logical systems, and other systems, to
accommodate the materials injected into their
bodies. (See Chapter 6 for more on inoculations.)

One subset of the heavy-metal theory proposes that pregnant women who
ingest contaminated fish or have fillings containing mercury can pass the
metals on to a developing fetus. However, it may not even be necessary for a
child to gain exposure to higher-than-normal levels of a toxin — if he can’t
excrete metals from his system, even normal exposure may be problematic.
Therefore, if a child has a heavy metal problem, doctors can’t say for sure
whether it’s primarily an exposure problem or an excretion problem.
The heavy-metal pattern isn’t identical in all cases. Many symptoms of autism
are similar to the symptoms of heavy-metal poisoning. Although the symp-
toms of mercury poisoning and autism overlap by about 90 percent, some
researchers have pointed out that the pattern of mercury poisoning is quite
different from that of autism.
Autoimmune or virus-induced 
theories of causation
Anywhere from 30 to 70 percent of autistic children have subtle immune
system abnormalities. Some doctors believe that autism may be triggered
during pregnancy, due to environmental influences to the developing baby.
Natural stress hormones from the mother, or any trauma such as chemical
exposures, may disrupt normal early development.
Immune-system problems in a pregnant woman or developing child may also
contribute to the symptoms, and maternal viral infections may be one of the
noninherited causes. For example, epidemiological studies show a risk of
autism in the offspring of mothers exposed to the rubella virus, or German
measles, early in their pregnancies.
Many autistic individuals have family members with autoimmune diseases
such as diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting a link between autism
and autoimmune problems. Certain research has suggested that a disruption
in the balance of cytokines (protein molecules that carry messages between
B, T, and other immune cells and that affect sleep and fever responses) is a
possible cause of autism.
As you can see, some research suggests evidence for autoimmune theories,
but other research is inconclusive. Autopsies of people with autism have
revealed unusually low numbers of critical immune system signaling compo-
nents, called Purkinje cells. However, research hasn’t yet turned up a correla-
tion between autoantibodies in the blood and brain abnormalities.
Research such as Andrew Wakefield’s initial study in 1998, which found
traces of measles in the stomachs of some autistic children, has implications
unrelated to the thimerosal controversy (see the previous sidebar). Some
theorists have used these findings to speculate that faulty immune system
49
Chapter 3: Causes, Clusters, and Clues: Where Does Autism Come From?

reactions to the measles virus itself, not the mercury-laden preservative
thimerosal found in some other vaccines, cause autism symptoms. In other
words, the autistic children’s systems couldn’t eliminate the virus the way
that normal children do after vaccination, so the virus stayed in their bodies.
We give you more discussion on safe inoculation scheduling in Chapter 6.
The Backlash Against the Cure
One day we will have a better understanding of autism and its causes. Until
then, some autistic people say they want to have relief from some of the
unpleasant symptoms of autism, but they don’t necessarily want to be
“cured.” Being “neurotypical,” they say, isn’t for them. In other words, they
don’t want to give up any of their unique attributes.
A number of autistic individuals have spoken out, suggesting that they don’t
need or want to be cured and expressing the opinion that intolerance of
people who are different from the norm is the greater problem. Many people
argue that autism, particularly Asperger Syndrome, isn’t a disease or a dis-
order in need of treatment or cure; they believe autism is simply a different
type of brain wiring.
These advocates warn that trying to eliminate autism from the population
will result in the loss of great talents and diversity for future generations.
They find the idea of developing a genetic test to detect autism in a fetus
especially disturbing and alarming. Society benefits from the talents of autis-
tic people, they say.
Autistic or supposed-autistic historical figures have made great contributions
to society, and their unconventional thinking generates innovative solutions
to problems. Society may lose these abilities forever if we eradicate all traces
of autism. Even founding father Thomas Jefferson, in the book Diagnosing
Jefferson (Future Horizons), by Norm Ledgin, is theorized to have had
Asperger’s.
This strain of thinking points to the delights, growth, and greater perspective
that a child with any level of autism brings to a family. Some siblings of autis-
tic children may have greater burdens, but through their challenges, they
grow up to be leaders for tolerance and understanding. (For more on familial
relationships dealing with autism, see Chapter 13.)
Some individuals with ASD, on the other hand, say that autism has caused
enough pain in their lives that they wish for a cure.

Most people believe that it remains our moral and ethical obligation to
people with autism, as well as to society as a whole, to continue developing
interventions aimed at helping people with autism use their strengths in
order to build fulfilling and productive lives.

The gift of a special perspective
Chris Collins is the father of an autistic child,
Nikki. He believes that autism isn’t a disorder,
but a gift. “People often react to Nikki’s autism
by saying, ‘I’m so sorry,’” Collins says, but he
considers himself lucky to have such a special
daughter. Collins lives with his wife, Eileen, and
their three children in New Jersey, where Nikki
attends school (half the time with a classroom
aide, half without). Here’s how he describes life
with Nikki:
“Our daughter, Nikki, is the second of three chil-
dren. Born in 1995, Nikki is a strikingly beautiful
little girl with a very charismatic personality. We
call her the ‘air that we breathe’ as a family. We
learned about seven years ago she is autistic.
Shortly after that day, my wife and I made a
decision in very casual fashion: We were going
to pursue the same path of happiness that we
planned on our wedding day. We were going to
treat Nikki exactly as planned. We were going
to continue to enjoy all the things in life that we
promised ourselves that we would enjoy, and
Nikki would be part of every minute of it. We
have learned more about love, appreciation and
the things that really matter in life than we could
have ever imagined. Nikki is an amazing human
being who teaches very strong lessons each
and every day. One very significant character-
istic of autism is that she only sees the world in
a literal sense. There is no sarcasm, exaggera-
tion, substitution, or lies. Everything is what it is,
and what a wonderful influence and lesson that
has been for our family. One recent day, while
on vacation, my wife and I were casually talk-
ing about the possibility of ever finding a cure
for autism. My 12-year-old son, Christopher,
quickly interrupted and with tremendous con-
viction and emotion said, ‘I hope not. I want
Nikki to stay exactly the way she is.’”
“We as a family have no illusions and do not
labor in the belief of a miracle cure. Nikki will
most likely live with us for the rest of our lives.
She will never have close friends or ever be
interested in the fun things that are so important
to little girls. We know that the stares and the
embarrassment over her peculiar behavior in
public places will be there forever. We know
that every public venture or event could have
the potential for unknown adventure. We also
know that having Nikki has been a gift that far
exceeds anything that we could have ever
hoped for in life. Although a major character-
istic of autism is the need for sameness, a day
does not go by that Nikki does not do or say
something new that makes us stop and think
about how special her perspective on her sur-
roundings is. She’s a little girl who loves
Christmas but couldn’t care less about gifts. It’s
the lights, the decorations, and the warmth that
she feels in the house that make her so happy.
One year it took until June for her to open the
last of her Christmas presents. As a family, we
have chosen to appreciate that gift and live our
lives, thankful every day for an autistic child to
be part of our lives. We have made the con-
scious decision that we would not let autism
slow us down, but rather allow it to make the
ride of life more rewarding.”

familial relationships, check out Chapter 13.

On the subject of a cure
Here are the words some autistic people offer
up about cures:
 Temple Grandin: “If I could press a button
and not have autism, I wouldn’t do it.”
 Donna Williams: “Some people seek
‘cures’ as though there is a ‘normal’ person
within an ‘autistic’ shell just waiting, like
sleeping beauty, for the spell to be broken.
Some look only for causes, forgetting the
‘now’ that people with ‘autism’ and those
who support them have to tackle today and
again tomorrow.” (Autism: An Inside-Out
Approach [Jessica Kingsley Publishers])
 Unknown author: “Sometimes I feel angry
when I read about attempts being made to
‘cure’ autism. I do not wish to be ‘cured’
from my autism, and many autistic persons
who are able to communicate their feelings
say the same thing. Autism is not something
that I have, it is something that I am. Autism
is in every emotion I experience, in every
thought I think . . . Everything! Autism is not
a cage, with us as the prisoners. You cannot
talk about a person ‘emerging’ from autism.
If it were possible to remove autism from 
a person, you would get a different person.
A person who, perhaps, fits in better with
his surroundings. Maybe a person who
abides by the rules of society more. A
person who does not stick out. That person
will look identical to the previous one, but
will be a different person nonetheless.”

am able to successfully use my set of char-
acteristics, which we refer to as autism,
and do not wish to be ‘cured’ out of a fulfill-
ing and productive life. However, we are
duty-bound to help persons more severely
affected with autism to lead fruitful lives 
to their greatest potential by using their
strengths.”

Getting a Diagnosis
With Lauren Underwood, PhD
In This Chapter
 Documenting your child’s medical history
 Expressing your concerns to a doctor
 Taking your case to a qualified specialist
 Receiving a diagnosis and dealing with the ramifications
P
erhaps your child has become withdrawn from the world or lost his abil-
ities of speech. Maybe he enjoys spinning objects hours on end, and
you’re concerned. Maybe a preschool or elementary school teacher recently
capped her comments on your child’s difficult time with a suggestion for an
evaluation just to make sure everything is okay. You even took your child to
his pediatrician recently, and the doctor looked quizzical after the examina-
tion and recommended that you see a specialist. These are just some of the
common pathways to an autism spectrum diagnosis.
Hearing a doctor associate the word autism with your child can be a terrify-
ing experience for a parent. Acceptance is especially tough when the child’s
early development seemed normal. Any regressive changes the child experi-
ences can be scary for the family and for the child himself. Your best course
of action is to arm yourself with information. Ingesting as much info as you
can helps you confront the fear, get a diagnosis, and set up a treatment plan
that works for you and your child as quickly as possible (head to Parts II and
III of this book for more info on treatment plans).
In this chapter, we help you track your child’s symptoms so you can get a
proper diagnosis; we point you in the right direction to find qualified profes-
sionals who can assess and help your child; and we begin to help you come
to terms with this difficult situation so you can take the necessary action to
ensure a full life for your family.

Tracking Your Child’s Medical History
Many new parents keep a medical history or diary of some sort for their 
children (whether motivated by doctors, family history, or their own record-
keeping instincts). A medical history is a helpful tool in any investigation of
medical conditions that arise at any point in a child’s life. The history is espe-
cially helpful in diagnosing autism because you’ve kept track of when the
child reached milestones and you’ve possibly found patterns in medical
symptoms.
You can keep a medical history for your child in a number of ways — in a
computerized spreadsheet or in an unspectacular loose-leaf notebook, for
example. Whatever method you choose, make sure your system is organized
and makes it easy to pull out needed information about your child.
Here are some important bits of information to keep track of in your child’s
medical history:
 Location and date of the child’s birth
 Any changes in feeding patterns or schedules
 Infections, including ear infections
 Antibiotics and other medications taken
 Vaccinations received
 Developmental milestones, including age of rolling over, smiling, sitting,
crawling, talking, and walking
 Changes in the child’s life, such as the following:
• Moving to a new home
• Change in family structure, such as marriage, divorce, death, sib-
lings, grandparent moving in, change in health status of a close
family member, and so on
• Starting or changing schools
• Making or losing friends or other social milestones
 Medical procedures and events, including
• Illnesses
• Treatments
• Surgeries
 Behaviors of concern, including
• Changes in verbal and other communicative ability
• Frustration
54
Part I: Understanding Autism 

• Strained interaction with others
• Repetitive motions
• Perseveration
Make sure you keep records of the mother’s pregnancy. The records may con-
tain information such as medications taken or illnesses experienced during
the pregnancy; the doctor can use this information to help make his or her
diagnosis and recommendations for treatment.
If you haven’t kept a history and you’re now noticing behaviors that are out
of the ordinary, you should start noting when you first began to see these
behaviors and ask others close to your child if they’ve observed any differ-
ences. (For a review of common symptoms and warning signs, check out
Chapter 1.)
Broaching the Possibility 
of Autism with a Doctor
For many parents, the search for a diagnosis begins when they sense a differ-
ence in their children (see Chapter 1). When they bring this “difference” to
the attention of doctors, many parents come unarmed. They don’t have all
the helpful information, and they don’t know what to expect. Don’t worry;
we’re here to help you prepare.
You have three main steps to follow to get a diagnosis for autism and other
conditions:
1. Bring your concerns to your child’s pediatrician or primary-care
doctor during a routine appointment, phone conversation, or even
during a special meeting you arrange to discuss concerns about 
your child.
2. Have a specific discussion with your doctor to get a referral to a spe-
cialist (such as a developmental pediatrician or neurologist) who’s
familiar with the autism spectrum.
Your aim isn’t to determine a diagnosis during this meeting; you want to
find an expert who can help you further.
3. Meet with the specialist so he or she can administer the proper assess-
ments to see if your child has autism.
This step deserves a full section of its own, so we provide it! See the sec-
tion “Consulting a Specialist” later in this chapter to cover this step in
detail.
55
Chapter 4: Getting a Diagnosis

Preparing for the consultation
These days, most doctors’ pay is based on the number of patients they see
over a given time, so they tend to give appointments a rushed feeling.
Sometimes the doctor is out the door before the parents have a chance to
voice their concerns. Recently, many doctors have been encouraged to
improve their “bedside manner” — to take the time to be polite and properly
explain their patients’ medical conditions. Although it may be hard when
frustration builds and emotions run high, do your best to remain polite and
keep a good relationship with your doctor. It benefits you and your child in
the long run to keep emotions on an even keel.
Proper preparation on your part can help keep your emotions in check and
keep the meeting moving in a swift manner. Your goal is to prompt the doctor
to schedule a consultation appointment or refer you to a professional who
has knowledge of autism and can help you.
Here’s a list of helpful items and mental reminders to have at the ready for
the appointment:
 Notes. Notes can take the form of a diary detailing the child’s behaviors of
concern. For example, you may want to take note if your child is lining up
blocks, having difficulty with transitions, feeling challenged by communi-
cation, displaying awkward social interaction, or exhibiting other autistic
tendencies. (For help identifying autistic tendencies, take a look at
Chapters 1 and 2.) In addition to specifics, you can jot down a general list
of observations you’re concerned about. Having a written record of your
concerns makes it more likely that you’ll get answers to your questions.
If possible, try to identify a correlation between foods and/or activities
and the child’s behavior. For example, a child with allergies may develop
red ears after eating certain foods. Another child may throw a tantrum
every time you turn the dishwasher on, due to a hearing oversensitivity.
 Your child’s medical history. (For an explanation of the importance of
this info, see the previous section.)
 A short verbal summary of your concerns. Decide ahead of time what
you plan to say to the doctor so you can determine how much time it
will take to get your message across. Most checkups last only 15 to 20
minutes these days, so you don’t have much time.
Consider timing yourself for a five-minute explanation about the con-
cerns you have about your child. Of course, five minutes isn’t nearly
enough time to properly express all your concerns. Remember, your
only goal is to raise enough concern in the doctor to warrant a consulta-
tion appointment or a referral to a professional who’s knowledgeable
about autism. You should also consider leaving a bit of time for the
doctor to ask questions of you.
56
Part I: Understanding Autism 

 Another person who’s familiar with your child. A supportive person
can mention something you may forget or help take notes about what
your doctor says.
Requesting a referral
The initial appointment you have with your primary caregiver should be
focused on sharing your concerns about your child in order to merit a refer-
ral to a specialist. Come prepared (see the section “Preparing for the consul-
tation” for tips) and feel free to request a referral if the doctor doesn’t offer
one. Tell your doctor that, if nothing else, you’d like to see a specialist to rule
out the possibility of autism.
Some doctors, due to lack of knowledge about autism or other reasons, may
be reluctant to make referrals. If you still feel a referral is warranted after she
presents some concerns, we recommend the following approaches to help
influence the physician’s decision:
 If your physician claims ignorance, educate her. A claim of ignorance 
is actually an opportunity in wolf’s clothing. Although you may feel dis-
couraged by your physician’s lack of knowledge, realize that she’s being
honest with herself and you. Grab this chance to suggest that she do fur-
ther research. One very helpful source is the Web site First Signs at
www.firstsigns.org. (Check out the Appendix in this book for
others.)
Make your physician’s job even easier by providing some or all of the
research material so she doesn’t have to spend time looking for it.
 Take a missed-milestone approach. Bring up a milestone that children
should pass within the next few months. Try to get the physician to
agree to a referral if your child doesn’t achieve that milestone by that
time.
 If your child is a toddler, consider breaking out a copy of the Checklist
of Autism in Toddlers (CHAT). Ask your physician to administer the
simple exam. The parent or caretaker answers less than a dozen “yes” 
or “no” questions, and the physician answers five more. The CHAT is a
screening, not a diagnostic instrument, meaning that a positive result
strongly suggests the need for further diagnostics. You can find a copy of
the CHAT on a number of Web sites, including www.depts.washington.
edu/dataproj/chat.html.
 Ask for a referral to a developmental pediatrician. A developmental
pediatrician specializes in pervasive developmental delays, so he or she
can become your ally in the effort to convince your physician why an
assessment is appropriate if your concerns are valid. Also, because
seeing a developmental pediatrician is less expensive for the parent or
caretaker than a full-blown diagnostic procedure, your doctor may be
more willing to make this referral.
57
Chapter 4: Getting a Diagnosis

An added bonus: A developmental pediatrician may be helpful in locat-
ing resources to help your child, such as books and articles, Web sites,
therapists, support groups, and other helpful organizations (for a thor-
ough listing of resources, see the Appendix of this book).
 Write a letter of appeal. All managed-care groups have a board or other
organization that patients can turn to for an appeal of a decision. Read
the literature of the group carefully to make sure you don’t miss dead-
lines or overlook other critical matters.
Some applicable information about appeals and other aspects of filing
for insurance reimbursement can be found at the Talk About Curing
Autism (TACAnow) Web site (www.tacanow.com/health_ins_
reimbursement_tips.htm) and at HealthSymphony.com. Sample let-
ters cost $10 as of this writing, but that investment may represent many
hours saved in drafting your own letter of appeal.
 Get the physician’s refusal in writing. Many doctors don’t want to
commit to a refusal, so they may back down.
 Find a specialist on your own. You always have the option of obtaining
an evaluation on your own from a qualified diagnostic professional or
facility.
However, without a referral from a physician, it’s much harder (or even
impossible) to get reimbursement from your health plan. But don’t
panic. If the assessment results in an autism spectrum or other develop-
mental delay diagnosis, you should send a letter to the doctor, with a
copy to the insurance company, explaining why you overruled his or her
objection. (If you saw a developmental pediatrician, you can also ask
that specialist to write a letter to your doctor to help convince your pri-
mary care physician that an autism spectrum diagnosis is warranted.)
Doing so can help you make a claim for an improper refusal and eventual
reimbursement (plus make it easier to obtain referrals for additional serv-
ices such as speech, occupational therapy, and other needed services in
the future). This procedure is risky, however, because you may not
receive a cent of reimbursement. You have to decide if the risk to a child
with undiagnosed autism is far greater.
Consulting a Specialist
The specialist, or team of specialists, conducts the assessment of your child’s
condition and issues the appropriate diagnosis or diagnoses (in many cases,
a child may have more than one diagnosis in addition to autism, such as dys-
praxia, depression, Tourette’s Syndrome, and so on).
In the pages that follow, we run you through the list of qualified specialists,
give you questions to ask when you meet the specialist(s), prepare you to
share all the necessary information, familiarize you with the assessment
58
Part I: Understanding Autism 

process, and outline the related conditions that complicate the autism 
diagnosis.
Contacting a qualified specialist
Only certain doctors are qualified to make an official diagnosis, and that qual-
ification varies somewhat from state to state. In general, the medical and psy-
chiatric community considers the following types of doctors (or doctorates)
qualified to diagnose a child with an autism spectrum disorder:
 Medical doctor (for medical diagnoses)
Note: Your child’s primary-care doctor may be qualified to make an
autism diagnosis, in the literal sense, but she may not feel qualified (or
really be qualified).
 Psychiatrist (for autism spectrum disorders and conditions found in the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders)
Commonly referred to as the DSM, the manual is published by the
American Psychiatric Association and is used to diagnose mental 
disorders.
 Child and adolescent psychiatrist
 Psychologist who has a PhD
 Child neurologist or psychologist
 Developmental pediatrician
Which specialist you’re referred to depends on, in part, who’s doing the refer-
ring and on your needs. For example, a child with many medical issues may
be better off seeing a developmental pediatrician. A neurologist, on the other
hand, is more helpful in diagnosing and treating accompanying conditions
such as epilepsy.
Often, people are nervous or anxious before going into the doctor’s office. If
you go in with a list of questions, you won’t forget to ask the important ques-
tions due to anxiety — and you certainly don’t want any hidden surprises
regarding topics such as costs. Here are some good questions to prepare for
the specialist for when you first meet:
 What training have you had in developmental disabilities? Ideally, the
doctor has specialized in developmental disabilities and will mention his
or her continuing education in this area over a number of years.
 How many children in your practice have developmental disabilities?
You want a number that gives you confidence that he sees children with
developmental disabilities on a regular basis.
59
Chapter 4: Getting a Diagnosis

 What made you decide to work in the developmental disabilities
area? You want to hear a passionate response. Perhaps a person in the
specialist’s family or a friend has a developmental disability, or maybe
she has an unexplainable attraction. Passion here is key.
 Do you treat autistic patients? If the specialist doesn’t know (or believe)
that treatment options are available for autism, “pooh-pooh” on him.
Also, if the specialist isn’t an advocate because some treatments are dif-
ficult or too time consuming, he probably isn’t the doctor for you and
your family.
 How much do you charge? This question is very important to ask! Be
wary of exceedingly high office-visit charges. Unfortunately, because no
standard medical treatments or labs are generally accepted for autism,
insurance companies often don’t accept submitted claims if the diagno-
sis of the patient is somewhere on the autism spectrum. This denial can
significantly affect what a healthcare provider charges.
 Do you take insurance? Unfortunately, many times the answer to this
question is no. Insurance companies don’t customarily cover services
for autistic children, and rather than trying to get reimbursed for their
costs, many healthcare providers choose to directly charge their
patients. It’s up to you to file with your insurance company to try to 
get compensated. 
When filing claims, make sure you list the specific diagnosis the con-
ducted test is for — such as chronic diarrhea for a stool test rather than
just “autism.” Being specific can help you get insurance coverage more
often.
 How long is an office visit? A typical visit can range from 15 minutes to
2 hours; it varies among healthcare providers. Usually, initial office visits
are longer than follow-up visits.
 Do we have time to talk after the examination is over? Some health-
care providers offer time to follow up and some don’t. If so, the special-
ist generally allows for a short conversation time (maybe 10 or 15
minutes), after an initial office visit, to review everything she has
observed. If not, ask if the specialist holds phone consultations — this
could be another way to follow up on questions you don’t think of
during the allotted time or ask about something you’ve thought of since
your last appointment.
 How many lab tests do you usually order? And how much do you
charge for these tests? The specialist may suggest additional laboratory
testing beyond the standard medical laboratory testing. After all, if you
don’t look for the problem, you won’t find it. Make sure you ask what
forms of testing a standard lab can perform and what forms require a
specialized lab. Occasionally, a healthcare provider will take advantage
of the need for additional testing and overcharge. Find out about the
available testing and related costs so you can be an educated consumer.
60
Part I: Understanding Autism 

 Do you check for food allergies? Many autistic children tend to be
prone to food allergies/intolerances. (See Chapter 8 for more diet info.)
Their immune systems react improperly to the foods they eat. When
these foods are eliminated, autistic symptoms are reduced. If the spe-
cialist says yes to this question, you know that she considers that there
may be underlying biological conditions that affect autistic patients.
 Do you check for celiac disease? Parallels have been drawn between
autistic children and patients with celiac disease (a digestive disease
that damages the small intestine and interferes with the absorption of
nutrients from food), so doctors need to rule out this condition and
other gastrointestinal disorders.
 Do you think candida (yeast) plays a role in autism? Many children
with autism have frequent ear infections when they’re young and are
treated with repeated doses of antibiotics. A yeast overgrowth is possi-
ble if the child has a faulty immune system. Many doctors believe that
an overgrowth of candida in the GI tract can lead to both leaky-gut syn-
drome (take a look at Chapter 7 for more information on this condition)
and a worsening of autistic symptoms. In many cases, treatment of yeast
results in a reduction of autistic symptoms.
 Are you willing to consider or explore medical treatments associated
with biological symptoms of autism? If the specialist is hesitant, 
speculative, or questioning, provide her with a copy of the paper men-
tioned in the sidebar in this section. You can find this paper in your
public or college library as well as online at http://aappolicy.
aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;107/5/
1221.
The specialist you choose (through recommendations and trial-and-error)
should
 Deal fairly, honestly, and respectfully. In other words, she should be
upfront and realistic about expectations of improvement and recovery.
 Be reasonably priced.
 Communicate truthfully, providing you with informed consent — 
especially when considering alternative medical treatments.
 Work cooperatively with you. She should be available to answer your
questions and discuss options with you.
 Act responsibly yet compassionately. She should consider alternative
treatments in a systematic, sensible, and thoughtful way.
 Engage in continuous education, keeping abreast of any new develop-
ments in treatment as they arise.
 Support and respect your choices. She should allow you to be a contrib-
utor and listen to your concerns, never forcing you to do something
against your better judgment.
61
Chapter 4: Getting a Diagnosis

Sharing information
Through the years, you may have accumulated useful records about your
child from other physicians, school departments, and people in regular con-
tact with your child that will be helpful to the specialist. If not, you can be
sure that most professionals and organizations have kept records of your
child that you can access upon request. You can start by calling your
doctor’s support staff for a referral on where to find this information.
Make sure that you sign any necessary release forms and leave plenty of time
for the transfer of information to occur. Try to plan it so that the information
reaches the specialist about a week before your first appointment. Note: In
many cases, the transfer of information can take up to a month or more.
Photocopying all records pertaining to your child along the way allows you to
give this important information directly to the specialist without being at the
mercy of other people’s timetables. If you haven’t started this practice yet,
there’s no better time than now. Although you need to be as prepared as pos-
sible, we realize that sometimes reality rears its ugly head, and you may need
to go into your meetings without as much preparation as you’d like. Just be
as prepared as possible from this point on!
Embarking on the assessment process
A specialist bases his or her diagnosis on several aspects. The assessment
process usually takes more than one session and should include the elements
we describe in the following sections, as the specialist seeks to find charac-
teristics consistent with what’s outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, Text Revised (DSM IV-TR), a tool for
diagnosing autism or other conditions. The DSM lists characteristics of hun-
dreds of conditions with the coding numbers being used by providers for
insurance reimbursement purposes.
62
Part I: Understanding Autism 
It’s okay to try stuff
The paper titled “The pediatrician’s role in the
diagnosis and management of autistic spectrum
disorder in children” [Pediatrics. 2001 May;
107(5):E85] lists alternative treatments such as
nutritional supplements, elimination diets, IVIG,
secretin, and chelation to combat the effects of
autism. The paper states that “Pediatricians
should approach alternative therapies openly
and compassionately, be willing to support a trial
of therapy in select situations — in such that
there are clear treatment objectives and pre-
testing & post-testing.” For more information on
these treatments, take a look at Chapters 7, 8,
and 9.

Some practitioners may use the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)
rather than or in addition to the DSM. The ICD is a detailed description of all
known diseases and injuries and is published by the World Health
Organization.
The main parts of the assessment process are the structured interview and
formal assessments, steps that the specialist uses to diagnose your child and to
get a picture of the child’s particular needs. In the structured interview phase,
the child and parent or other significant caretaker answer questions to give the
examiner an idea of how the child functions as the specialist looks for clues of
autism and tries to determine the child’s specific need areas. Later that day or
in another session, the doctor makes formal assessments by observing the
child as he or she has free time to explore the office, engages with the exam-
iner or assistant in game-like activities, and completes certain tasks upon
request. The specialist uses information from these information-gathering ses-
sions to diagnose your child and plan for appropriate intervention. The follow-
ing sections dive into greater detail about the steps.
Structured interview
The structured interview process gives the specialist time to obtain a thor-
ough review of the patient’s developmental history. The notes and records
you painstakingly prepared (hopefully) or painstakingly requested from doc-
tors and schools (a good fallback plan) up to this point are invaluable.
Specialists have many assessment methods at their disposal to examine your
child during the structured interview. Two of the best known and most reli-
able of the assessment instruments are the following:
 Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R): During this assessment,
the examiner asks probing questions in the areas of language, communi-
cation, social developmental, and play.
 Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communication Disorders
(DISCO): This assessment profiles an individual’s pattern of develop-
ment and behavior for the diagnosis of autism and related conditions (as
well as a determination of needs).
Other, less common possible interview assessments include the following:
 Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (GARS): A checklist for parents. This ques-
tionnaire, which takes only 5 to 10 minutes, focuses on four categories:
stereotyped behaviors, communication, social interaction, and develop-
mental disturbances.
 Parent Interview for Autism (PIA): This tool is a structured interview
measuring the severity of autism over a number of behavioral domains
and is helpful for supporting general recommendations. The PIA is more
commonly used outside the United States.
63
Chapter 4: Getting a Diagnosis

Formal assessments
Formal assessments of your child include structured observations where the
examiner observes as your child plays by him or herself or with you. At other
times, the examiner plays games with the child to assess those interactions
and test for specific skills. Here are some of the more well-known formal
assessments:
 Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS): Focusing on commu-
nication and social behavior, the examiner uses this method to rate the
child’s attempts to accomplish a set of eight tasks on a scale ranging
from “normal” to definitely “abnormal.” A pre-linguistic version of this
assessment is available as well.
 Child Autism Rating Scale (CARS): The CARS method is a rating scale
for children with autism that includes 15 items the observer/scorer rates
on a 4-point scale.
 Autism Screening Instrument for Educational Planning, Revised
(ASIEP-2): By focusing on the behavioral domains of sensory input, relat-
ing, body concept, language, and social self-help, the ASIEP-2 aids in the
evaluation of people on the autism spectrum.
During the formal interview, the specialist often tests for specific skills sets,
and she may use some of the following additional assessment tools, accord-
ing to the child’s needs. (Note: Specialists use these tools and others like
them to hone in on the child’s needs rather than to give a diagnosis.)
 Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Revised: Designed to identify and
suggest interventions for cognitive and motor delays, this assessment
focuses on mental development and motor control.
 Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale: This assessment focuses on verbal
reasoning, abstract and visual reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and
short-term memory, for comparisons with typical or average functioning.
 Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales: For this approach, the examiner
interviews the child’s parents, teachers, or care providers in order to
specifically assess adaptability and evaluate the areas of communica-
tion, daily living skills, socialization, motor skills, and maladaptive
behaviors.
The three previous tests we mention were constructed for typically develop-
ing children. Comparing scores achieved by children with autism against
“normal expected score” is difficult at best. The true power in these tests is
in determining a child’s characteristics as compared to diagnostic criteria.
The assessment follow-up
Shortly after the assessment process, the person (or persons) conducting the
process makes an appointment to discuss her findings. Here are some of the
more common diagnoses you may hear (in many cases, people receive two or
64
Part I: Understanding Autism 

more diagnoses; you can find much more about diagnoses and the different
flavors of autism and related conditions in Chapter 2):
 Classic autism
 Asperger Syndrome (AS; see Chapter 5 for a thorough investigation)
 Pervasive Development Disorder — Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS)
 Rett Syndrome
 Nonverbal learning disorder
 AD/HD
 Tourette’s Syndrome
 Dyspraxia of speech
Finding out why she chose a diagnosis or diagnoses, as well as why she ruled
others out, helps you gain a better understanding of the situation as she puts
it into context. If you don’t feel as if the specialist covers these topics in an
adequate manner, feel free to ask the examiner the following questions, as
suited to your situation:
 “What are the reasons for your diagnosis?”
 “What other diagnoses may also apply here and why?” (We cover other
possible diagnoses in the section “Diagnosing related conditions.”)
 “Can you name any other reasons for the onset of his or her symptoms?”
If you’re happy with the specialist and the assessment process, you can move
forward with her in the stages that follow. If you feel like the advice or service
a specialist provides is inappropriate or unsatisfactory, you can ask for
another referral from your primary care physician (if you feel comfortable,
you can ask for names from the specialist to bring to your primary care
physician) or make an appeal with your insurance company (we discuss
appeals in the section “Requesting a referral”).
Diagnosing related conditions
Professionals primarily diagnose autism spectrum disorders through the guid-
ance of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), pub-
lished by the American Psychiatric Association. As a result, doctors and other
professionals qualified to give a diagnosis (see the section “Contacting a quali-
fied specialist”) determine whether a child has autism through behavioral char-
acteristics. In fact, no medical test in existence at this time can reliably identify
autism. So, why talk about medical issues in people with autism, period?
65
Chapter 4: Getting a Diagnosis

Because many people with autism often have accompanying medical condi-
tions that deserve a diagnosis in their own right. The following list outlines
some of these medical conditions:
 Bipolar disorder
 Anxiety
 Epilepsy
 Celiac disease (a digestive disorder related to a gluten intolerance)
 Post-traumatic stress disorder
 Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD)
John Ratey, MD, believes that disorder of attention is a component of
autism in general.
 Food allergies or sensitivities
 Drug allergies or sensitivities
 Specific phobias
 Immune system dysfunctions
 Low levels of metallothionein (a protein that helps your body metabo-
lize and regulate metals)
 Sensory integration dysfunction (affects the way a person processes
sensory information, like sounds, sights, and tastes)
 Dyspraxia (an impairment in the organization of movement)
The term for two or more diagnoses existing at the same time is co-morbid. It
may be a horrible sounding word, but if you or someone close to you has
autism, you’re likely to hear it, so get used to it!
Doctors need to administer tests to rule out these medical disorders or to
identify a co-morbid medical condition, which helps to pinpoint the proper
diagnosis. These tests can be expensive, so be sure to find out if your insur-
ance company covers them. Asking your doctor to verify the medical need
for these types of tests increases the chance that your insurance company
will cover them. For example, it’s entirely reasonable for a doctor to order 
an electroencephalogram (EEG) for a child who’s having seizures.
The following list outlines some medical tests your child may undergo, along
with a brief explanation of why they may be helpful to you:
 Hearing tests. Due to sensory differences, many children with autism
are initially thought to be deaf. An audiogram (a test that measures your
body’s ability to sense sounds at increasing and decreasing levels) or
tympanogram (a test that measures your body’s response to sound and
pressure changes in the ear) will likely rule out a hearing impairment —
or, in rare instances, prove that one exists.
66
Part I: Understanding Autism 

 Genetic testing. Blood tests can rule out Fragile X Syndrome (a chromo-
somal difference linked to autism in some patients) or other chromoso-
mal differences that result in characteristic physical features and
autistic-like behaviors. (For more information on the link between
autism and Fragile X Syndrome, check out www.fragilex.org/html/
autism.htm.)
 Metabolic screening. Blood, urine, and stool lab tests can determine
how a person metabolizes food. The tests can also reveal allergies and
other intolerances that you can treat with medication and dietary
changes.
 Brain assessments. Non-invasive (meaning that a technician evaluates
the body from the outside) brain tests look for possible differences in
brain structure and activity. Some procedures include the following:
• Electroencephalogram (EEG): This test measures brain waves to
look for seizures, tumors, and other differences. Because you need
to obtain measurements when a seizure or other abnormality
occurs, you may have to extend the EEG from an overnight test 
or day trip to as long as a week.
• Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): Using a very powerful
magnet, doctors get a high-resolution picture of the brain in order
to look for physical differences.
• Computer Assisted Axial Tomography (commonly known as a
CAT Scan): An X-ray tube rotates around the patient, providing a
high-resolution picture of the brain structure (as well as other
parts of the body, if needed) in a search for abnormalities.
With the possible exception of an EEG, medical tests don’t indicate what spe-
cific treatments or services will be effective; instead, they help identify or rule
out some of the root causes of medical and (possibly) behavioral concerns.
Dealing with the Impact of the Diagnosis
Finding out your child has an autism spectrum disorder is very difficult. We’re
not going to tell you that the road ahead will be easy. You may have to rewrite
the script of your child’s life (and your own). You have a whole new set of
issues, pressures, and decisions to deal with now. And people around you may
not understand or appreciate the depth of what you’re going through.
Important first steps include allowing yourself to process the diagnosis and
then motivating yourself to take action. Early intervention is vital because
the brain has its greatest plasticity during the early stages of the disorder’s
development (Chapter 18 provides a list of additional steps you should take
immediately after receiving a diagnosis).
67
Chapter 4: Getting a Diagnosis

Coming to terms emotionally
In some ways, parents describe receiving the diagnosis of autism as a kind of
death. “It felt like a death sentence — all our hopes and dreams about his
future changed in a day,” remembers one mother (who has since been named
“Autism Parent of the Year”).
And although a verdict of death for your child, yourself, or anyone’s education
is a big stretch, a diagnosis of autism does change your family’s life. It requires
a period of bereavement and the acknowledgement that life will never be the
same. Finding out you have a disability or that you have to parent a child with
one is a life-changing, momentous event, and you need to work through it.
You’re not weak if you seek out help to deal with the emotional impact, nor
should you feel guilty about the various negative emotions you experience
during the process. It’s normal to feel angry, sad, or hopeless at first. However,
you don’t want to allow this to paralyze you. If your emotions interfere with
your ability to function or to help your child, you need more support. You
shouldn’t try to go it alone.
Parent support groups are godsends for the people who belong to them. Your
peers in the group may not have answers for your child’s situation, but
they’re going through similar struggles, and they’ll listen and offer feedback.
You may not consider yourself a “joiner,” but going to only one meeting may
convince you that a support group is a worthwhile investment of your time.
(Joining a listserve may also be what you need to feel connected; see the
Appendix for more info.)
Taking action
We have no known cure for autism, but an approach or collection of
approaches can lessen the more severe effects of the disorder, allowing 
a person on the autism spectrum and his or her family to lead a fulfilling 
and productive life.
Because of the great diversity in the autism spectrum, each child has differ-
ent needs. You need to take steps immediately to determine which interven-
tion(s) works best for your child and locate persons who can provide that
intervention such as an allergist, an immunologist, a gastroenterologist, or a
nutritionist. (We discuss many of the more popular and successful interven-
tions available to meet your child’s needs in Parts II and III.) And because
your child’s needs tend to change over time, you need to constantly monitor
his or her progress and work closely with your doctors.
68
Part I: Understanding Autism 

Avoiding scams
After an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis, parents and other family mem-
bers are often in shock and denial about their child’s condition. This mindset
puts you in an extremely vulnerable position. You may want to escape into
some fantasy world and believe that you can find a “magic bullet” to make
you child’s autism . . . disappear. In this state, you very well may be willing to
do whatever it takes to “cure” your child’s autism. You’re frantically looking
for help, which means you’re susceptible to accept it from people who claim
that they have the “miracle cure.”
Unfortunately, recovery of function from autism just doesn’t happen like that.
You need to be aware of hoaxes; false, deceptive, and/or misleading advertis-
ing; and promises that a particular treatment is “the cure.” In the absence of
any orthodox, widely accepted biomedical intervention that has substantial,
totally proven benefits for treating autism, parents naturally want to explore
all the possibilities. But you need to protect yourself. If a treatment seems
too good to be true, it probably is. If a treatment seems too far out, it proba-
bly is. If a doctor seems too expensive, she probably is.
Here are some helpful hints to avoid the scam artists and avoid being taken
advantage of:
 Don’t just spend whatever it takes. Just because you’re willing to spend
the money doesn’t mean your child will get better. Don’t put a second
mortgage on your house or take out loans you can’t afford to pay back.
Be prepared to spend money, but spend wisely. Bankrupting your family
won’t help your child.
This advice goes for seeking medical help as well. Paying exorbitant
charges or fees for services isn’t the norm among respectable healthcare
professionals’ practices. Stay away from providers who double or even
triple charge for what an office visit or test would cost!
 Doctor shop. Look around for medical professionals; you don’t have to
go with the first one you meet. Ask your primary care physician for mul-
tiple referrals or recommendations during the diagnostic process.
Interviewing healthcare providers is an excellent way to get a feel about
how they run their practices.
 Seriously consider the ramifications of uprooting your family just to
get the desired professional help in another city or state. Some treat-
ments require travel, but try to find comparable treatment close to
home whenever possible.
 Don’t let anyone guilt you into a treatment. No one should make you
feel like no matter what you do, it isn’t good enough, or that you can’t
spend enough, time, money, or effort trying to “fix” your child’s autism.
69
Chapter 4: Getting a Diagnosis

 Don’t be humiliated or shamed into thinking that you owe a particular
treatment to your child. With help and feedback from doctors and your
child, it’s up to you to know what’s best for his or her treatment. You
should be battling the autism disorder, not any people butting in to lend
their two cents.
Watch out for anyone who claims to be “an expert in the biology of autism”;
anyone who charges exorbitant fees and/or misrepresents his or her person-
ality; and anyone who says that he or she has the cure for autism. To date,
there is no known absolute cure. You must rely on treatments that can lead to
the reduction of autistic behaviors and toward recovery.

Asperger Syndrome and Autism
In This Chapter
 Identifying Asperger’s spot on the autism spectrum
 Exploring ways to help people with Asperger’s socialize
 Working through states of heightened emotion
 Moving from childhood to adulthood with Asperger Syndrome
A
sperger Syndrome is classified as one of the Pervasive Developmental
Disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(see Chapters 2 and 4 for more on this manual). Although Asperger’s is some-
times considered just a “dash of autism,” people who are familiar with the
condition know that kids (and adults) with the disorder face many significant
challenges. A 5-year-old child spouting off about her passion for space explo-
ration may be cute, but it may not be so cute to see the same behavior in an
adult. One of the many challenges she faces is harnessing the motivating
power behind her interest as she transitions to adulthood. Additionally, per-
sons with Asperger Syndrome often go undiagnosed or get misdiagnosed, due
to the often considerable verbal and mental strengths they may have to com-
pensate for their weaknesses.
We’ve chosen to dedicate a chapter to Asperger Syndrome because of the
wide variation between the strengths persons with the condition have and
the challenges they face. In many situations, people with Asperger’s function
at typical or above typical levels. This high level of functioning in some areas
often blinds parents, caretakers, teachers, and other professionals to some of
the real challenges people with Asperger’s face, making the need for advoca-
tion even greater.
In this chapter, we show you how Asperger Syndrome fits into the autism
story. We identify the traits of a typical individual with Asperger Syndrome.
To benefit the person with Asperger’s and her family and friends, we look at
strategies designed to help people with Asperger’s cope with the social pres-
sures, emotions, and stresses that affect them daily. Finally, we look at ways
to ease the transition from school age to adulthood for those with Asperger
Syndrome.

Discovering Where Asperger Syndrome
Sits on the Autism Spectrum
People with Asperger Syndrome tend to be exceptional. Their ability to com-
municate, rote memory, and visual and other strengths often blind teachers,
doctors, family members, and others of some real challenges in socialization,
pragmatics, and in others areas. As a result, children and adults with Asperger
Syndrome often don’t get correct diagnoses or receive the proper treatment
and support until later in life (compared to those who are more severely
affected with autism and are more noticeable). Professionals sometimes refer
to Asperger Syndrome as the “new kid on the block” because the diagnosis
didn’t even appear in the Diagnostics and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
until 1994 (the DSM is published by the American Psychiatric Association and
is used to diagnose mental disorders).
In order to become more familiar with Asperger’s, which leads to more accu-
rate diagnoses and better educational and social settings, you (along with
doctors and teachers) need to become more familiar with the characteristics
of the disorder. The following sections show you where the condition fits on
the autism spectrum (see Chapters 1 and 2 for more information on the spec-
trum and the types of autism).
Examining common characteristics 
of Asperger’s
Individuals with Asperger Syndrome often exhibit some of the following 
characteristics:
 Average to above average IQ. Not everyone with Asperger Syndrome is
a genius; however, many people with this condition have significant
intellectual gifts. People elsewhere on the autism spectrum tend to have
lower measurable IQs (although this is a big generalization, and every
case is unique).
 Concrete “black-and-white” thinking. Many people with Asperger
Syndrome don’t understand unspoken rules, due to difficulties with
interpreting figures of speech and nonverbal communication. They tend
to rely solely on the words themselves. Difficulty with perceiving non-
verbal communication causes significant challenges during social inter-
action. The same characteristic holds true for people with more classic
autism. However, this trait tends to be more startling in those with
Asperger Syndrome, due to their often superior verbal skills.
72
Part I: Understanding Autism 

As President Emeritus of the Asperger’s Association of New England,
author Stephen Shore sees dozens of people with Asperger Syndrome who
have high IQs. However, due to challenges in understanding the unspoken
rules of employment, they’re greatly challenged in finding and being suc-
cessful at any sort of typical job (see Chapters 14 and 15 for more on life
after high school and Chapter 16 for more on money matters).
 No significant clinical delay in verbal communication. However, the
verbal communication of people with Asperger’s is often characterized by
differences in melody, rhythm, tempo, and pitch of speech — otherwise
known as vocal prosody. Individuals with Asperger Syndrome can often
utter complete, grammatically correct sentences without knowing what
they actually mean. This contrasts with people who are more severely
affected with autism. People on this end of the spectrum may be nonver-
bal, meaning they communicate through means such as sign language and
graphics.
 Desire to have friends without knowing how to make and keep them.
This social conflict can result in loneliness and sometimes leads to the
person using unusual ways to attract friends and, when entering adult-
hood, significant others. For example, a person with Asperger Syndrome
may monologue about a personal passion without perceiving the non-
verbal cues that the listener is getting bored and needs to have a chance
to talk — or to change the subject. Co-author Stephen Shore defines a
good time as spending a whole afternoon examining parked airplanes on
a frozen lake in Alaska with a friend that he hasn’t seen in four years
who also has Asperger tendencies.
 Sensitivities to sight, touch, hearing, taste, and smell. Input to one or
more of these senses often overwhelms people on the autism spectrum.
(See Chapter 10 for more on sensory issues.)
Diagnosing Asperger Syndrome
The primary goal of diagnosis is to provide a shorthand summary of a
person’s characteristics, which lay the groundwork for developing accommo-
dations for the person’s needs. Like “Autistic Disorder,” the Diagnostics and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) categorizes Asperger Syndrome
as one of the Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD). Just as it does with
classic autism (see Chapter 2), the DSM divides the diagnostic criteria for
Asperger’s into two categories in the following sections.
The manual stipulates that a person needs a total of six characteristics to
receive an autism diagnosis; however, a person needs only two characteris-
tics from Category 1 and one from Category 2 to receive a diagnosis of
Asperger Syndrome. And tossing the categories aside, experts require a
person to possess four additional characteristics to warrant an Asperger’s
diagnosis. Read on to survey the scene.
73
Chapter 5: Asperger Syndrome and Autism

Category 1
The first diagnostic category is qualitative impairment in social interaction,
as manifested by at least two of the following:
 Marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors, such as
eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures to regu-
late social interaction. Simply put, the person has difficulty interpreting
and expressing body language.
 Failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental
level. This often shows up with having friends and acquaintances that
are older, younger, from other cultures, or who have other differences.
 Lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, achievements, and
interests with other people (in other words, the individual doesn’t show,
bring, or point out objects of interest to other people).
 Lack of social or emotional empathy. The person may have difficulties in
matching another person’s emotion while interacting.
74
Part I: Understanding Autism 
Looking at a typical person 
with Asperger Syndrome
Ten-year-old Sam is fascinated with airplanes
and talks about them at every opportunity. In
fact, he once held his own in a discussion about
vector thrust steering with an Air Force pilot 
for an hour — until the gentleman tired! Sam
almost always finds a way to bring airplanes
into his interactions, which interferes with his
education, life at home, and relationships.
In school, Sam exhibits difficulties in reading
comprehension, but when an aide properly
organizes his work, he performs above grade
level in mathematics. Sam has difficulties in fine
and gross motor control, and he’s often the last
picked for team sports in gym; most of the chil-
dren in his inclusion class also shun him during
lunch and recess. Sam’s teacher indicates that
right before gym, Sam’s repetition of questions
increases dramatically, and he rocks so much
in his chair that it squeaks, disturbing the class.
One day, Sam’s repetitive question for the day
was “What time is math scheduled for today?”
Math class had been cancelled for a general
school assembly. Instead of telling Sam about
the change in plans and risking a tantrum, the
teacher responded with “Math will meet later
today,” figuring that she could help Sam deal
with the schedule change after gym class.
Sam’s teacher answered his repeated requests
with “later today”. Each time the teacher
rebuffed Sam’s question, Sam would talk louder
and rock harder in his chair. He also started
flapping as he usually does when under stress.
Finally, the school called Sam’s mother to
remove him from school because he had bitten
a teacher and was having a major meltdown 
on the classroom floor. Sam briefly apologized
to his mother and fell asleep in the car on the
way home.
What’s going on with Sam? Sam has difficulties
with transitions — especially unexpected ones.
He needs help with organization and recog-
nizing when he’s getting upset, though he’s 
very intelligent. In short, Sam has Asperger
Syndrome.

Category 2
The second diagnostic category is restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped pat-
terns of behavior, interests, and activities, as manifested by at least one of
the following:
 Encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted
patterns of interest that are abnormal either in intensity or focus
 Apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or
rituals
 Stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (like hand or finger flap-
ping or twisting or complex whole-body movements)
 Persistent preoccupation with parts of objects
Final four Asperger necessities
A person must also meet the four criteria that follow in order to warrant a
diagnosis of Asperger Syndrome:
 The behaviors and tendencies of the person cause clinically significant
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
 The person experiences no significant clinical delay in language (in
other words, the person uses single words by the age of 2 years and
communicative phrases by age of 3 years).
Many diagnosticians use the criteria of “no significant clinical delay” as a
major differentiating factor between autism and Asperger Syndrome.
 The person experiences no significant clinical delay in cognitive devel-
opment or in the development of age-appropriate self-help skills, adap-
tive behavior (other than in social interaction), and curiosity about the
environment.
 The person must not meet the diagnostic criteria for another specific
Pervasive Developmental Disorder or schizophrenia.
Does your child have Asperger Syndrome?
If you believe your child meets or comes close to meeting the diagnostic cri-
teria for Asperger Syndrome after reading through the previous sections, or if
a caretaker or teacher expresses concerns, you may want to prompt a discus-
sion with your child’s pediatrician or other healthcare provider.
See Chapter 4 for more information on getting a diagnosis, developing a treat-
ment plan, and finding the right doctor.
75
Chapter 5: Asperger Syndrome and Autism

Examining typical nondiagnostic 
personality traits of Asperger Syndrome
What the DSM fails to note is that although people with Asperger Syndrome
don’t often experience a significant clinical delay in language, the use of lan-
guage, as well as vocal rhythm and melodies, tends to be quite unique in
these people. What can you take from this? A number of additional common
characteristics exist beyond what the DSM captures.
In the following list, we include common characteristics that make up the
personality of someone with Asperger Syndrome:
 Exhibits literal, rather than figurative, thought. People with Asperger’s
find it difficult to accurately decode nonverbal communication (tone of
voice, body language, facial expressions), so they often rely on words.
For example, one time I (co-author Stephen Shore) was giving a presen-
tation, and lunchtime was approaching. The conference organizer was
concerned that I was going to run over on time. He asked me, “What
time does your watch say?” My immediate response was, “My watch
doesn’t say anything because it can’t talk.” After the laughter died down,
I realized that he really wanted me to be aware of the time, and I quickly
wrapped up the presentation. (The section “Handling idioms and figures
of speech” later in this chapter suggests ways you can help your child
deal with overly literal thought.)
 Experiences excess of emotions. One common myth is that people with
Asperger Syndrome don’t feel emotions or empathize with other people. In
fact, many report that they feel too much emotion but have difficulty recog-
nizing what the emotions are and how to express them in a manner non-
spectrum people can understand. Often, people with Asperger Syndrome
seem to fly into a rage without notice. However, you can strive to teach
76
Part I: Understanding Autism 
Feeling comfortable in your skin (and label)
Here are some words on diagnosis from co-
author Stephen Shore:
“I’m often asked this question: ‘Do you have
autism or Asperger Syndrome?’ Based on my
childhood and current experiences, I consider
myself to have Asperger Syndrome. However, I
began to exhibit autistic tendencies at the age
of 18 months, when I lost functional communi-
cation. My speech didn’t begin to return until
age 4, classifying me as autistic. My interests
and other characteristics seem more Asperger-
like. Finally, I realized that just considering
myself as being on the autism spectrum is good
enough for me.”
The primary goal of diagnosis isn’t to obtain a
label, but to gain understanding of what’s going
on. A diagnosis helps to provide a shorthand
summary of a person’s characteristics.

people with Asperger’s and those who support them to recognize behav-
iors and other clues that signal impending meltdowns and resulting behav-
ioral outbursts. (For more on controlling emotions, see the section “Dealing
with the Emotions Triggered by Asperger Syndrome” later in this chapter.)
 Has trouble with socialization. Communication experts suggest that
body language and other nonverbal interactions make up as much as 70
percent of a person’s total communication package, and most people
with Asperger’s have trouble recognizing these nonverbal cues. Some
people with Asperger Syndrome seem shy — painfully aware that they
lack the proper knowledge for successful social interaction. Others may
be social responders of sorts, where they commit multiple social blun-
ders in their eagerness to interact with others. However, people with
Asperger Syndrome can learn important components of socialization
with direct instruction. (For more on the topic of socialization, see the
section “Helping People with Asperger Syndrome Socialize”.)
 Excels at academics (with appropriate intervention). People with
Asperger’s seem to have average or greater IQs and are capable of grade-
level work and higher, but they’re often challenged by extremes in learn-
ing styles. Although a person’s rote memory skills may be good, he may
have a concrete and literal thinking style causing difficulties; he may
also show rigidity, have problems with organizing material and effi-
ciently organizing his time. However, you can make accommodations to
meet his challenges by taking advantage of his intelligence.
Many people refer to children with Asperger Syndrome as “little profes-
sors” because, for example, they may engage their highly developed rote
abilities using advanced vocabulary, all while maintaining adult tones of
voice to discuss topics of special interest, such as vector thrusting in
fighter planes. However, it may be difficult for them to generalize the use
of specialized terms, such as “vector,” in other areas such as mathemat-
ics or “thrusting” a fork into a piece of meat. They seem more mature
than they are because of the way they talk, but don’t be fooled — they
often have very real challenges in cognitive flexibility, generalization,
and organization of academic material.
 Experiences sensory overload. As with other forms of autism, people
with Asperger’s have some of their senses turned up “too high,” whereas
other senses don’t register enough information. Environmental data
received by a person with Asperger’s has greater distortion than for
people not on the autism spectrum. And some research indicates that
people with Asperger’s have a greater tendency to have a more negative
response to sensory overload than persons with other forms of autism.
(See Chapter 10 for tips on dealing with sensory overload.)
People with Asperger’s tend to be visually based learners, yet they may
favor aural, kinesthetic, or another sensory mode for learning. The prob-
lem is that whereas most people can learn through a non-favorite sense,
people with Asperger’s may find it impossible. This is why multi-modal
(more than one sense) teaching is so important (see Part III for more on
the educational issues that come with autism).
77
Chapter 5: Asperger Syndrome and Autism

 Exhibits poor motor skills. The tendency toward poor motor skills, bal-
ance, and coordination often creates problems in myriad situations,
from penmanship and art to games, physical education, and other social
situations. As a result, tasks like writing by hand take a lot longer for
children with Asperger’s than for typical children.
However, it’s important not to let your child get discouraged. You can 
do a lot with occupational therapists to help with poor motor skills.
Additionally, enrolling a child with Asperger Syndrome in a movement-
oriented class, such as one in the martial arts, can help with coordina-
tion and self-esteem. Interventions such as sensory integration or hip-
potherapy (which we describe in Chapter 10) can also be of great help.
Helping People with Asperger 
Syndrome Socialize
If you’ve ever experienced difficulty learning the customs of a culture when
traveling to a foreign country, you have a small inkling of what it can be like
to live with Asperger Syndrome on a daily basis. Professionals have devel-
oped numerous solutions to make life easier for people with Asperger’s, both
in school and socially. Many of these solutions have been adapted from other
interventions for classic autism or created anew especially for Asperger’s. We
outline some of these unique strategies in this section.
78
Part I: Understanding Autism 
A social responder makes a gaffe
A social responder is a person with Asperger’s
who may commit multiple social blunders in an
eagerness to interact with others. Sometimes
such a person is aware of the need for working
on her social skills and can misread a situation
as she’s trying to improve it. The following para-
graphs illustrate one example of how this can
happen.
Upon arriving to a church dinner, Dena Gassner,
a person with Asperger Syndrome, noticed that
a few people were putting silverware and plates
on empty tables. Thinking that she should be
polite and helpful, she quickly prepared the
places at all the tables with eating utensils.
“How rude of them to prepare only a few place
settings” she thought, but she was determined
to demonstrate good social skills by keeping
quiet about it.
Suddenly, a great commotion arose as the orga-
nizers frantically started preparing even more
tables and food for what they thought were at
least 100 more people than expected.
She soon realized that her eagerness to
respond in what she thought was a socially
appropriate way, had caused the chaos. Her
behavior was completely against the unwritten
rule that everyone was responsible for their
own place settings and that placing utensils and
a plate on the table, in fact, nonverbally com-
municated, “I have reserved this place for
myself and family.”

It’s vital that caregivers, educators, and doctors customize the program devel-
oped for people with Asperger Syndrome for the individual child’s needs. It
may be helpful to view the available solutions as part of a shopping list where
you choose what you need and leave the rest in the store. (You can find addi-
tional sources for help on finding more solutions that you can customize for
your situation in the Appendix.)
Finding the hidden curriculum
Because social interaction is one of the more striking impairments of people
with Asperger Syndrome, many socialization solutions are based on what
Brenda Smith Myles, a professor of special education and an Asperger
Syndrome researcher at Kansas State University, refers to as the hidden cur-
riculum. The hidden curriculum is the set of unwritten rules that nobody
directly learns but that everyone knows. Myles’s book, The Hidden Curriculum:
Practical Solutions for Understanding Unstated Rules in Social Situations (Autism
Asperger Publishing Company), written along with Melissa L. Trautman and
Ronda L. Schelvan, shows how violations of these rules can make an individ-
ual a social outcast in school, in his or her community, and other locations.
Table 5-1 describes some of the places to find the hidden curriculum.

79
Chapter 5: Asperger Syndrome and Autism

You can tell social stories or role-play to handle many situations created by
problems with hidden curriculum. When role-playing it can be helpful to act
out the “wrong” and the “right” way of doing things. Here are some examples
of hidden curriculum, corresponding with the entries in Table 5-1:
 Discuss and act out seating at the dinner table (if you have a specific
order in your home).
 Engage in interactive conversation.
 Go over the appropriate times and places to swear, and discuss the
swearing that often goes on among classmates.
 Practice giving up a seat to an elderly person or a person with a physical
disability.
 Review appropriate behavior when approached by a police officer or
first responder. Stress that the results of making a mistake can be pretty
severe.
 Brainstorm suggestions to propose to a supervisor of a better way to do
a task.
Handling idioms and figures of speech
Idioms are expressions where the intent or meaning differs from the literal
depiction or face value of the words. For example, the common expression
“just wait a second” usually entails waiting a good deal longer than a second,
which can be hard if one interprets spoken language literally (as people with
Asperger’s do)!
Here are some more examples of idioms that can be confusing to people with
Asperger’s:
 Do you have the time? (Possible response: How can you have time?)
 Get off my back! (Possible response: I’m not on it!)
 Put a lid on it! (Possible response: Put a lid on what? What lid?)
 Don’t hold your breath! (Possible response: Why would I?)
You can teach idioms and figures of speech through strategies such as car-
tooning, as suggested by comic-strip conversations that use stick figures and
other simple symbols, along with conversation and thought bubbles. See
Figure 5-1 for an example.
Solutions such as this work best with a visually based, concrete sequential
learning style — a common characteristic of people with Asperger Syndrome.
80
Part I: Understanding Autism 

Here are a few more ways you can teach idioms and figures of speech:
 Discuss possible explanations for idioms, followed by role-playing. Go
through a situation where you take the idiom seriously, and follow it by
doing what you should’ve done when such phases come up.
 Go on “idiom hunts.” Watch a short sitcom or other television excerpt,
and point out whenever you “sight” an idiom. When you spot one, have
a discussion about its meaning (you can then role play, which I discuss
in the previous bullet).
 Introduce interventions such as social stories and Power Cards, which
we describe in Chapter 13.

Hidden curriculum: Not just for autistic people
Hidden curriculum is everywhere, and it trips up
many people who don’t reside on the autism
spectrum. For example, a salesperson coming
into a home for the first time who mistakenly sits
in the owner’s favorite chair probably loses the
sale. The salesperson can sidestep this problem
by simply asking where he or she should sit.
Likewise, a job applicant who sits down before
the interviewer reduces his chance of landing the
job. Apparently, the culture of sitting is a big deal!
A great resource for people with and without
Asperger’s to learn the hidden curriculum of
body language is The Definitive Book of Body
Language (Orion), by Allan and Barbara Pease.

Dealing with the Emotions Triggered 
by Asperger Syndrome
People with Asperger Syndrome feel emotions just as keenly as others, with
two major differences:
 They tend to express emotions differently from typical expectations.
 They may not recognize the buildup of strong emotions such as anger —
especially after a period of frustration.
The second difference often leads to the first — namely, the buildup of emo-
tion can spill out in ways that people may see as unreasonable. At times, out-
bursts may be unavoidable, but caregivers do have some strategies at their
disposal to help minimize episodes as much as possible.
In the following sections, we show you how to recognize each step of the rage
cycle and how to plan and react so you can shorten or reduce the intensity of
what can seem to rival a volcanic explosion. We also give you some tips to
combat bullying, a common problem among children that can further impact
your child’s unstable emotional state.

Asperger Syndrome isn’t a fancy 
excuse for misbehavior
Sharon has a 15-year-old son with Asperger
Syndrome named John. “Growing up, John said
the strangest things at the strangest times. When
riding in the cart at the grocery store, he’d say
everything on his mind to passersby. He’d shout,
‘Cancer will kill you, mister,’ at 3 years old!’”
On another occasion, John told a man standing
near them in a store that he had “a sassy face.”
The man looked at Sharon and said, “What did
you do to this kid? You brainwashed him.”
Turning to John, he commented, “You should
get a spanking for that attitude.”
Even some of Sharon’s friends and family
thought the diagnosis of Asperger Syndrome
was just a fancy excuse for John’s misbehavior.
They’d say, “He wouldn’t act that way at my
house. Don’t believe everything those psychol-
ogists tell you.”
Because most people with Asperger Syndrome
have an average to above-average IQ, people
tend to get blinded by their strengths. They
wonder why people with Asperger’s have such
difficulty in areas such as making friends, being
socially appropriate, or with certain subjects 
in school. People with Asperger Syndrome have
strengths and challenges just like everyone 
else — just to a greater extreme.
Because Sharon’s son has Asperger Syndrome,
it’s very likely that he needs direct instruction for
proper social interaction. Two good interven-
tions for teaching appropriate social interaction
are social stories, by Carol Gray, and Power
Cards, developed by Elisa Gagnon, which we
discuss in this chapter.

Avoiding the rage cycle
Authors Brenda Smith Myles and Jack Southwick, who wrote Asperger
Syndrome and Difficult Moments: Practical Solutions for Tantrums, Rage and
Meltdowns (Autism Asperger Publishing Company), use the term rage cycle to
refer to three things that happen when a person with Asperger Syndrome, as
well as any supporters around him, misses the cues of what may seem like a
volcano erupting.
The three stages of the rage cycle are rumbling, rage, and recovery:
1. Rumbling: The precursor of the impending human volcanic explosion.
You can figuratively feel the ground shake, and you know that something
bad is going to happen soon.
2. Rage: When the volcano blows. The child loses control of his emotional
and physical being, and like with a volcano, you may experience a lot of
noise and destruction.
3. Recovery: The aftermath of the eruption. Just as the community on the
mountainside has to rebuild after the volcano erupts, the child and
those around him need time to put themselves back together.
Check out Table 5-2 for common behaviors that occur during each of these
stages, adapted from Myles’s and Southwick’s book.

Chapter 5: Asperger Syndrome and Autism

Now that you have the background on emotional outbursts, you can move
forward to take steps to curtail them. The following sections provide you
with possible interventions for the rumbling stage, a survival guide for the
rage stage, and tips for getting through the recovery stage when an episode
takes place.
Interventions for the rumbling stage
It may seem like people with Asperger Syndrome fly into a rage without warn-
ing, but that isn’t necessarily the case. By keeping the rage cycle in mind,
people who support children or adults with Asperger Syndrome can learn to
read the cues that indicate that the “volcano” is about to erupt.
Fortunately, you have a number of interventions (originally devised by 
Myles and Southwick) you can employ to help your child circumvent a rage
episode during the rumbling stage. The following list presents some of these
interventions:
 Nonjudgmental removal. Remove the child from a situation in a positive
manner. For example, if a child is getting anxious from activity occurring
in the kitchen, you could encourage him to take a box of tissue paper to
another parent or sibling in the living room.
In classroom situations, children with Asperger’s often get fidgety. You can
instruct the teacher to ask your child to bring an envelope to the office.
The envelope is empty, and the child will most certainly take a detour or
two on his trip. However, the 5 to 10 minutes of lost classroom time is a
bargain in return for avoiding a meltdown and having the child’s attention
for the remaining class time.
The point is to distract the child and interrupt the rumble-rage-recovery
pattern. You need to make sure that these interruptions don’t become a
routine that enables the child to avoid work or other tasks at hand.
 Support from routine. Having a chart or visual schedule of the day’s
events at the ready can help the person with Asperger Syndrome feel
more secure. The person can reassure himself as to what’s coming next
or prepare for what would otherwise be an unexpected change.
Forewarned is forearmed. People with autism function much better if
they can enjoy predictability. One way you can build more predictability
is by making sure your child is aware of his schedule on a daily basis —
especially if he must deviate from his usual routine. In fact, most people
do better when their schedules are planned out.
 Interest boosting. Showing an interest in a person’s passion shows that
you value that person, and your actions can often disrupt rumbling. This
intervention is also known as redirecting.
A few minutes talking about or otherwise engaging in a child’s passion
may buy you several more minutes of getting through a difficult situa-
tion, such as waiting in the cashier’s line at the supermarket.
84
Part I: Understanding Autism 

It may seem like you’re rewarding a child’s misbehavior by allowing her
to avoid a situation or do something more pleasant. However, if the
child’s ability to pay attention or control herself hasn’t already reached
zero during the rumbling stage, it soon will if she flies into a rage. Also,
going into a rage is emotionally and physically exhausting, as well as
embarrassing; it isn’t something any child wants to do.
 Acknowledging difficulties. As with any person, acknowledging the dif-
ficulty of a task helps validate a child’s feelings. For example, if your
child talks out of turn during a conversation, you can state, “I know this
is hard, Veronica, but the family rule is that everyone waits for the
speaker to finish before making a comment.”
 Cool zone. Designate a room with low sensory stimulation where a child
can take his work or thoughts when the rumbling stage occurs. This will
reduce the stress involved. Expecting the child to complete his work
while in this room prevents the cool zone from becoming a way to avoid
work, too.
 Walk — don’t talk. Let the person with Asperger Syndrome walk to cool
off. Make sure a safe person accompanies her. Unless the person with
Asperger Syndrome tends to run away, the safe person should just walk
along to calm the child down. The rule here is that the child can say any-
thing or nothing, and the safe person remains quiet. Anything said “Can
and will be used against you.”
Surviving the rage stage
The rage stage can be scary and seem everlasting, especially because you
want it to end so badly. The best advice we can give you is that during the
rage cycle, the adult should remain calm, talk quietly, breath deeply, avoid
power struggles, and be flexible at a time when the child is unable to. The fol-
lowing list gives you some more tips on getting through the period of rage
with you, your surroundings, and, most importantly, your child in one piece:
 Safety first. A person in a rage stage has no control over herself and
must be kept safe. Try to remove delicate and dangerous objects from
the area. A rage state isn’t a spectator sport. Everyone, except for the
one or two people supporting the person with Asperger Syndrome,
should leave the area.
In a school situation, a teacher may ask an aide or other person to take
the other students out of the classroom or at least away from the child
in a rage state.
 Stay low and slow. Yelling back, making threats, and towering over
someone in a rage state merely prolongs the situation and makes it
worse. Breathe deeply, try to relax, and keep talking to a minimum —
you can even try to say nothing at all.
85
Chapter 5: Asperger Syndrome and Autism

 Disengage emotionally. The rage is about a situation — not you person-
ally. The words the child may say and the behaviors he exhibits aren’t
under his control. Try to disengage and think about something else,
such as planning a shopping list or dinner.
It can be helpful to graph the child’s rage behaviors so that you can plan your
responses to her actions. You’ll quickly find out what works and what doesn’t,
based on our suggestions here.
If your child seems to experience the rage cycle frequently or engages in
behaviors that are dangerous, you should consult a professional who’s
knowledgeable about Asperger Syndrome, such as a psychiatrist (see
Chapter 4). Dramatic changes in the frequency of rage cycles may also war-
rant getting additional professional help.
Getting through recovery
After the “volcano” blows, the “mountain” becomes very tired. A child in
recovery may apologize for her actions and then seem very tired, often going
right to sleep. Give her all the sleeping time she needs, and take that time to
recharge your batteries and go into damage control mode. If your child doesn’t
fall asleep, you can use relaxation techniques to help her calm down or redi-
rect her to a low demand activity or passion of hers.
However, you must realize that your child is still very fragile at this stage, and
you can trigger another eruption if you make too many demands of her. If
your child is in the recovery stage, you should set aside any ideas of her
being able to learn or interact with others. The recovery stage isn’t a time for
teaching new material or doing a “post mortem” on what just happened; that
step can occur later.
At the time of recovery, referring to, reviewing, or trying to analyze the
child’s behavior during the rage state may turn her right back into a human
volcano.

Part I: Understanding Autism 
Do “timeouts” help?
A common punishment meted out to autistic chil-
dren who exhibit challenging behaviors is to send
them to timeout rooms, allowing them to think
about what they did wrong and perhaps to calm
down. In reality, a growing number of develop-
mentally oriented practitioners question the valid-
ity of an imposed timeout. As one professional, 
Dr. Arnold Miller (who developed the Miller
Method; see Chapter 9), says, “I question the
practice of further isolating a child who already
is challenged with socialization as being produc-
tive.” Refer to the list in the section “Interventions
for the rumbling stage” for more constructive
ideas.

After the child has sufficiently recovered, consider gently reintegrating her
into her routine, reviewing things she has already learned. This drives home
the point that the day’s work must still be done and that a bad incident in the
morning need not spoil the whole day.
Working through frustration
Teaching others how to accurately decode the prelude of an emotional explo-
sion is a bit like giving a hungry man a fish for dinner. The man is satisfied for
a meal, but what happens when he’s hungry again? It’s much better to teach
the man how to fish. Teaching a child with Asperger Syndrome to recognize
his own emotional states and their intensities is much more powerful and is
like teaching a man how to fish. Both the fisherman who knows how to fish
and the child with Asperger Syndrome learn to get along in the world without
constant aid.
However, the challenges of understanding the rules for social interaction 
make it difficult for people with Asperger Syndrome to plan and gauge their
responses. Just as one may study and even carry a guidebook for getting along
during a business trip to a foreign country, visual aids, such as Power Cards,
can act as a resource for people with Asperger Syndrome (see Chapter 13).
For example, you can teach a child with Asperger Syndrome that when he feels
frustrated, he can employ a number of tactics to calm himself down. The two
major motivating factors behind Power Cards are employing a child’s passion
and involving a hero figure. For example, you can help a child with a special
interest in space exploration cope with frustration by showing him a Power
Card featuring a picture of Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon,
and providing instruction on relaxation techniques.
For more information on Power Cards, take a look at the book Power Cards:
Using Special Interests to Motivate Children and Youth with Asperger Syndrome
and Autism (Autism Asperger Publishing Company), by Elisa Gagnon.
Using emotion thermometers 
to gauge emotional states
Making the most of the visual strengths of children and adults with Asperger
Syndrome can be very helpful. To this end, you can help your loved one
gauge his emotional state by making a thermometer that allows him to visual-
ize the appropriate intensity of his emotional responses for a given situation.
For example, in Figure 5-2, you see a thermometer with a 100-point scale. At
the top, the point 100 indicates sublime happiness. You see 50 in the middle,
which covers the neutral middle ground. And at the bottom, the frigid 0 point
87
Chapter 5: Asperger Syndrome and Autism

indicates a sad state. Working together with your child, you can draw a simi-
lar thermometer and write in some of the physiological signs indicating his
different emotional states. For example, feeling cold, slow, and sleepy could
indicate a sad state close to 0. When your child exhibits certain signs, you or
another caretaker can refer the child to this thermometer to help him deter-
mine his emotional state when you see these behaviors and what he should
do in order to take action. “Gee, I see that you’re grimacing and pacing a lot.
Let’s check your emotional thermometer to see where your emotions are and
what may help you calm down.”
Along with the happy/sad thermometer, it helps to have a thermometer that
determines the level of stress your loved one has. The thermometer in Figure
5-3 shows a 100-point scale, from high stress to completely content, complete
with suggestions for visual clues and recommended interventions (for more
on particular interventions, see the section “Interventions for the rumbling
stage”). For example, if your child is pacing and grimacing, you may suggest
that “we go check out the stress thermometer.” When you both discover that
your child’s behaviors merit a 70 or higher stress level, you can work on tech-
niques to bring that stress level down.

Recognizing Bullying and Its 
Emotional Repercussions
Regrettably, bullying in school, on the playground, and beyond is a fact of life
for people with differences. Most people on the autism spectrum report bul-
lying experiences in school. Some research indicates that 94 percent of chil-
dren with Asperger Syndrome are bullied in school.
Bullying is characterized by four key components:
 A power imbalance. The bully may be stronger, have better social
awareness or social status, and have other physical or psychological
advantages.
 Intent to harm. The bully takes negative actions with the intent to
reduce the innocent person’s standing in the community and to gener-
ally cause physical and emotional suffering or injury.
 A distressed target. A bully often focuses on a person who’s different
than most of the others in a group. A child with Asperger Syndrome
often fits the bill.

Chapter 5: Asperger Syndrome and Autism

 Repeated negative actions. Bullying isn’t a simple, one-time event; it’s a
series of attacks that tend to escalate in nature.
Sometimes a teacher uses sarcasm to control students’ behavior or to elicit
particular results, often without malicious intent. This action is often referred
to as educational bullying. If you suspect educational bullying, you may want
to schedule an appointment with your child’s principal to discuss your con-
cerns. Make sure you address your concerns with the teaching style instead
of blaming a teacher who likely means no harm.
Bullying can have significant negative impact for people with Asperger
Syndrome. Some people report suffering from posttraumatic stress syndrome
resulting from mistreatment by their peers. Other life-long effects range from
poor self-esteem and depression to, for those with autism, an even greater
reluctance to engage in social interaction for fear of reprisal. Intervention is
important as soon as you detect signs of bullying. The following sections 
present the signs and give you tips for putting a stop to the bullying.
Signs of bullying
Difficulties in reading nonverbal social cues may be part of the reason why
children with Asperger Syndrome have such a high rate of bullying. Consider
the following example:
Four students who are part of the “in crowd” walk up to Tommy and ask,
“What’s up?” Tommy thinks for a moment, lifts his eyes upward, and pro-
ceeds to report the number of lights in the ceiling and how the tiles are
glued to the ceiling so that they remain “up.” The other students laugh
and say, “Great job, Tommy.”
Later, you ask Tommy about his classmates. Tommy says, “They are good
friends of mine. They talk to me, ask me questions, and laugh a lot.” You
make up your mind to talk to Tommy’s teacher about the situation.
If your child with Asperger’s shows one or more of the following conditions
or behaviors, chances are high that he or she is being bullied in school:
 More scratches and bruises than usual. Other school children may be
pushing, punching, or otherwise excessively roughhousing your child.
 School avoidance. Your child may try to stay home, complaining of a
stomachache or other illness. Sometimes school can be so stressful that
the child becomes sick more often.
 Changes in character. The child may seem sad or depressed.
Sometimes, the child being bullied acts out the events he or she experi-
ences by becoming the bully to siblings or even pets.
90
Part I: Understanding Autism 

Taming the bullies
Fortunately, a growing number of educators, parents, and others are realizing
the life-long damaging effects on self-esteem that bullying can have. More and
more schools are beginning to educate their faculty and students on detect-
ing and preventing bullying, and more schools have adopted zero-tolerance
policies for bullying.
The first step in stopping bullying is awareness. Due to the often covert
nature of bullying, students report a teacher intervention rate of 25 percent,
even though teachers report intervening almost 75 percent of the time during
bullying incidents.
You can help increase awareness by gathering information from faculty, staff,
students, and parents through anonymous surveys or small group discussions.
It’s important to bring together people who most likely have different defini-
tions of bullying to some sort of consensus on detection and prevention.
One good resource for bullyproofing at the school, classroom, and individual
levels is the book Perfect Targets: Asperger Syndrome and Bullying, by Rebekah
Heinrichs. Another good resource for detecting and working out bullying issues
for children is the Inventory of Wrongful Activities (I.O.W.A.), found at www.
pathwayscourses.samhsa.gov/bully/bully_supplements.htm.
Transitioning to Adulthood
The interventions we describe in this chapter provide you with a template for
dealing with challenges people with Asperger Syndrome face — challenges
that remain in the transition to and during adulthood. Just as with other

Chapter 5: Asperger Syndrome and Autism
Asperger Syndrome and violence
You may read news articles about people with,
and suspected of having, Asperger Syndrome
committing acts of violence. Some researchers
blame the condition for a variety of heinous
acts. However, you can reframe this issue with
the realization that almost all these situations
are preceded by a long history of bullying and
ostracizing from society by classmates.
Most people with Asperger Syndrome and other
disabilities report being bullied in grade school
and beyond. Given the long-term negative
effects of bullying on the person being bullied
and on the bully, developing policies toward
greater awareness of people with differences
and enforcing zero tolerance for bullying in
schools will go a long way in the fight to reduce
acts of violence — acts that perhaps anyone is
capable of when faced with consistent bullying.

types of autism, children with Asperger Syndrome grow up to become adults
with Asperger Syndrome. Some of the main challenges of adulthood for
everyone on the autism spectrum include employment, interdependent
living, continuing education, self-advocacy and disclosure, and relationships.
Most people spend 75 to 80 percent of their lives as adults. Asperger’s doesn’t
go away when the child leaves school. Although it isn’t possible to cure
Asperger’s, life tends to get better after graduation from high school as the
person transitions into the adult worlds of community, work, and college.
Many people with Asperger Syndrome and high-functioning autism aren’t
attending secondary education or working to their potential because they
haven’t learned the skills needed for successful interdependent living.
However, with just a little support, people at this end of the autism spectrum
can lead fulfilling and productive lives. For example, a person challenged by
organization can have someone help him keep his affairs in order a few times
a week. The result may be a person who can now live independently, pay
more taxes than service costs, and contribute to society.
One way to accomplish the goal of interdependence is to project into the
future what accommodations the person may need to accomplish employ-
ment, living arrangements, and other goals, based on interests and current
needs. For example, a person who needs assistance in transportation to
school may want to investigate public and private transportation options 
for adults with disabilities.
For more information on transitioning to adulthood for all people on the
autism spectrum, check out the chapters in Part IV.

In this part . . .
A
growing population of parents with autistic children
is knocking on the door of the medical profession,
looking for answers and a cure. How does medical science
meet this demand? Read on to find out. In Part II, we give
you the current options for medical care for people with
autism, ranging from medications that control secondary
symptoms to biomedical treatments that have helped
some people with autism live fuller, healthier lives. Some
cures have been claimed, but doctors disagree on exactly
what a cure looks like. As of now, we have no definitive
cure for autism; no medically based assessments that tell
you whether you have it; and no medical treatments that
the FDA approves.
We also discuss what medications can and can’t do for
people with autism in this part, and we cover what new
treatments promise and what they’ve been able to deliver
(so far).

T
o the date of this publication, no known medication can cure autism.
However, medication can be incredibly useful in reducing conditions that
often go along with having autism, such as debilitating anxiety, depression,
seizures, aggressive behaviors, some sensory issues, insomnia, and digestive
problems. With careful administration of medication from a qualified doctor
(see Chapter 4), many people suffering from these conditions, autistic or not,
can derive much more pleasure and enjoyment out of life.
In this chapter, we look at some of the more common medications and their
effects, identify what side effects you need to watch out for, and highlight the
particulars to be vigilant for when caring for people with autism.
Considering Drug Therapy
Taking medication, like almost everything people do, has its benefits and
risks. For example, if you ride your bicycle to work, you have to balance the
benefit of exercise, greater convenience, and saving money with the possibil-
ity of knee injury or getting hit by a car. Your most important job as a parent
or caregiver is to be aware of both the benefits and risks so that you can
make an informed decision when considering drug therapy for a child. We
look at these factors in the following pages.

Looking at how medication 
can realistically help
Before you jump into a drug-therapy regimen for your child, you need to
understand your motivations and what medications can and can’t do. In par-
ticular, what are the goals for taking the medication? Do the potential gains
outweigh the possible risks? How long do you need to wait to see if the medi-
cation achieves the desired effect? Make sure you do sufficient research,
using the Internet, books, people who have taken the drugs, and, of course,
medical doctors.
A medical doctor who can plainly explain the possibilities for both benefits
and side effects of a medication is worth his or her weight in gold. For more
information on finding and utilizing a good doctor, check out Chapter 4.
Here’s the bottom line on what medications can and can’t do:
 Medications can
• Address some of the symptoms that often occur with autism (like
anxiety or depression; see the chapters in Part I for more info).
• Reduce some of the physical and mental causes of certain behav-
iors often associated with autism (like seizures, poor digestion,
and some sensitivities).
• Help some people with autism begin to cope with their 
environments.
 Medications can’t
• Cure autism.
• Make a person start talking.
• Make a person more intelligent.
• Make a person learn new skills.
Educating yourself and 
pursuing drug therapy
New medications and new information about existing drugs are constantly
added to the mix of possible interventions, so the best way to proceed with
the utmost care is by remaining current.
When you decide you have an interest in pursuing drug therapy, you should
head to the following resources:
96
Part II: Addressing Physical Needs 

 Start by making an appointment to discuss the pros and cons of some
of the more common medications for children with autism with your
doctor. Never be afraid to discuss any questions or concerns you have
with your doctor. That way, you can be prepared for potential problems
such as side effects, which we discuss in the next section.
Bring another person with you to the appointment, if possible, to com-
pare notes. You should also consider obtaining permission from the
doctor to tape the conversation for your records.
 Read up thoroughly on the medication, including its on- and off-label
uses and its side effects. Before you administer any medication, read up
on the drug by using the latest version of the Physician’s Desk Reference
(Thomson PDR), available from a reference library for free or for purchase
at a bookstore. You can also read up on literature from pharmaceutical
company Web sites, as well as other trusted Web and written material.
The Pill Book (Bantam), by Harold Silverman, is an easy to read, accu-
rate, and reliable introduction to many medications. You can find it in
most large drugstores for under $10.
 Look up what people have to say about a drug by using a search engine.
Just remember that you’re often reading opinions from personal experi-
ences, which can affect the reliability and validity of what’s present.
Using medication wisely
Medicating an autistic person can be a catch-22 situation. An autistic person
may need medication to function better within society, but the body of an
autistic person does its best to reject medication. Medical tests have shown
that autistic people are more prone to drug reactions and rare side effects
that doctors don’t often seem to worry about. People on the autism spectrum
are more likely to have paradoxical reactions, which occur when a drug
should function one way but does the opposite. And, generally speaking, the
autistic population is more likely to experience drug toxicity, or toxic effects
from a drug regardless of the amount taken. An autistic person’s body doesn’t
always get rid of medications as fast as the average person’s does. As a
result, a person on the spectrum may need to start a medication at a much
lower dose than normal and likely remain on that low dose. Careful monitor-
ing by the person with autism, caretakers, and doctors is required.
The administration of medication changes the chemical function of any body,
however, making it a very serious matter, so you need to follow a few simple
rules before you alter your autistic child:
 Start or stop medications only under the supervision of a qualified
medical professional. In other words, don’t begin or end a program of
medication on your own.
97
Chapter 6: Injecting Yourself with Knowledge about Autism Medication

 Follow instructions exactly. Administer drugs at the recommended
times and dosages, and follow all the directions.
 Beware of mixing medications with certain substances, such as the 
following:
• Food: For example, people shouldn’t drink alcohol and grapefruit
juice with certain medications. Discuss the food and drink effects
of the medication you’re administering with your child’s doctor.
• Other medications: Inform the doctor (and the pharmacist for
backup) of any other drugs you’re administering, ranging from
simple over-the-counter drugs (such as aspirin, cough medicine, or
allergy pills) to the most tightly controlled substances. Dangerous
interaction effects may exist between the medications.
• Herbal, complementary, or other non-prescription supplements:
Inform your doctor about any therapies you may be pursuing
because they may interact with the medications already being 
used — even if it means you must help provide the research by
handing your doctor relevant articles. (See Chapter 7 for more info
on supplements and the like.) For example, St. John’s wort is so simi-
lar to a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) that a person
may experience a bad side effect if he or she is already taking Zoloft
(an SSRI; see the following section for more on these drugs).
 Identify any possible side effects related to the medication. Common
side effects can include
• Lethargy
• Insomnia
• Constipation
• Changes in appetite or weight
• Dry-mouth
• Nausea
If you’re an autistic adult considering drug therapy, ask your doctor
about any possible effects the medication may have on sperm counts
and sexual function if you’re a man and effects on fertility, pregnancy,
and nursing if you’re a woman. Also, find out if a family member has
tried a drug you’re considering. Given the genetic influence on drug tol-
erance, you may want to consider shying away from drugs that have
caused blood relations to suffer from bad side effects.
 Pay special attention to any black box warnings. You find black box
warnings, which may appear in all capital letters or surrounded by bold
black boxes (hence the name), on antidepressants. The boxes warn 
parents about the increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in
children and adolescents being treated with these medications. Think of
these warnings as a call for extra vigilance when administering such
medications.
98
Part II: Addressing Physical Needs 

The good news is that the side effects associated with these drugs relate
to full dosages. Medication prescribed for patients with autism tends to
be at much lower doses, which often reduces the frequency and severity
of negative side effects.
 Be aware of possible errors. Doctors and pharmacists do make mis-
takes, so if you suspect that the medication or dosage is wrong, contact
the doctor or pharmacist.
 If a drug or other intervention is working, think carefully before you
change anything. Even switching to or from generic versions of medica-
tion can be fraught with problems due to slight differences in manufactur-
ing. However, if the child you care for is suffering from a strong side effect
of a medication, you may want to consider switching despite the risk.
Identifying Helpful Medications
Medication doesn’t cure autism, but it can help lessen some of the more debil-
itating effects. The medical field uses four major groupings of medication to
help with the co-occurring characteristics of autism (see Chapters 2 and 3):
 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)
 Atypical antipsychotics
 Tricylic Drugs
 Antiepileptics
You can take a closer look at each category in the following sections.
However, we start with information on beginning the medication search
process with the right doctor, because the wrong doctor can send your child
99
Chapter 6: Injecting Yourself with Knowledge about Autism Medication
Wrong drugs happen
Kassiane Sibley, a person who has autism, writes
about her experiences with anticonvulsants:
“The first anticonvulsant I tried was oxcarba-
mazepine (Trileptal). The doctor didn’t believe
me that autistic people have lazy livers, so I
started on too high a dose. Because of this I
was too tired to tell if it was working, and I fell
down a lot. One day I was too stupid to remem-
ber how to write my name. These are not normal
side effects. These are signs of wrong drug 
syndrome. Yes I made that phrase up. I was
switched immediately to another medication. A
year and a half later I tried it again, on a much
slower titration (dose raising) schedule. It
brought me down from an elevated, manic
mood, but it also triggered 2 kinds of seizures,
including drop attacks. This might be why I fell
so much the first time, but I wasn’t aware I was
epileptic then. Wrong drugs happen.”

into a medical tailspin. We also discuss medications that deal with rage and
other challenging behaviors in more severely affected people with autism at
the end of this section.
Medications outside of these four groups can be helpful for people with
autism as well. Make sure you consult with your doctor about all the avail-
able options if you aren’t keen on any of the big four.
Beginning the process with 
a qualified doctor
You have many considerations when making decisions about medication, and
a knowledgeable doctor can make the process so much smoother. A doctor
who can help with medication decisions for your autistic child has the follow-
ing characteristics (you can find more information about choosing the right
doctor in Chapter 4):
 The doctor understands the implications autism spectrum disorders
have in metabolizing medication based on experience.
 The doctor understands the concept of needing to start low and go slow
with initial and continuing doses of medication.
 The doctor helps you understand the risks and benefits of medications
to help you maintain perspectives on the possibility of side effects.
Like with all medications, you need to work closely with your prescribing
physician when receiving autism meds for your child — especially if you
observe no change in unwanted behaviors or symptoms, or you observe an
unwanted change. Certainly, you should also keep your doctor aware of 
when things are going well.
The length of time your child takes a particular medication depends on fac-
tors such as the following:
 Has the effectiveness of the medication changed over the time of its use?
 Does a new medication your doctor introduces have a bad interaction
with medication your child is currently taking?
 Can you get a generic drug available at a lower cost? Be aware, however,
that even the slightest variation in chemical make-up between similar
drugs from different manufacturers can have a large effect on the med-
ically sensitive person with autism.
100
Part II: Addressing Physical Needs 

Selective Serotonin Reuptake 
Inhibitors (SSRIs)
SSRIs are types of antidepressants often used to reduce anxiety in people
with autism. Your child may be debilitated with anxiety, which can severely
reduce functioning. The application of SSRIs may enable him to interact more
successfully with his environment. SSRI drugs can be expensive, and insur-
ance companies tend to not cover autism-related medical expenses. However,
you may have more success with coverage if your doctor codes the medica-
tion for “excess anxiety” in this case.
Chemical differences in people with autism may result in atypical reactions to
medication. Often, people with autism are hypersensitive to antidepressants,
and doctors should strongly consider beginning with one-third to one-half the
normal starter dose. For many individuals, antidepressants continue to
remain effective at the low does. Higher doses may cause agitation or insom-
nia. Be sure your doctor is aware of these potential dosage issues.
SSRIs promote the passing of information between neurons by inhibiting the
reuptake of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that plays a role in mood, sleep, and
appetite, to name a few. The additional time the serotonin remains between the
cells increases the likelihood of the recipient cell recognizing the serotonin.
Common SSRIs
The current SSRIs available to you (generic name listed before the trade
name) include the following (in order of when they came on the market):
fluoxetine →Prozac, Fontex, Seromex, Seronil, Sarafem
sertraline →Zoloft, Lustral
paroxetine →Paxil, Seroxat, Aropax, Deroxat
fluvoxamine →Luvox
citalopram →Celexa, Cipramil, Emocal, Sepram
escitalopram →Lexapro

Chapter 6: Injecting Yourself with Knowledge about Autism Medication
Drug reactions and autism
Shared by Kassiane Sibley, a person who has
autism:
“In my case — and remember, everyone is dif-
ferent — if a med is processed by the liver, I will
always be on a very low dose (sometimes below
the normal start dose), but if it is processed by
the kidneys, I will eventually end up on a rather
high dose. Regardless of what organ deals with
the medication, it takes me a long time to get to
a final dose, assuming my body tolerates [the
medication] at all. My doctor says he’s never
seen someone have so many drug allergies.”

The longer a drug has been on the market, the more doctors and users know
about its usages and side effects.
As of press time, only Prozac and Zoloft are fully approved by the United
States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for people under 18 years of age.
Although not strictly considered addictive, SSRIs can cause withdrawal symp-
toms. Doctors associate withdrawal with anxiety, unusual body sensations,
and dizziness. Withdrawal from an SSRI should occur only under the care of a
competent professional.
Possible SSRI side effects
In 2004, researchers suggested a correlation between SSRIs and an increased
risk of juvenile suicidal thinking (not actual suicide) in acutely depressed
patients, measuring twice the rate of a placebo. It’s important to note, how-
ever, that researchers saw no completed suicide in the SSRI group and one in
the placebo group. As a result, all antidepressants (both SSRIs and tricyclics)
carry the warning of increased suicide risk in children and adolescents.
Another concern is possible mental dullness associated with taking this class
of drug. Some studies report reduced sexual function in as many as 41 to 83
percent of people taking SSRIs.
Atypical antipsychotic drugs
Atypical antipsychotic drugs are used to treat psychiatric conditions and are
FDA-approved for treating schizophrenia. Doctors are using them more and
more in place of what are known as typical or first generation antipsychotic
drugs. In lower doses, these drugs serve to control anxiety, anger, and rage.
For example, a doctor may prescribe 6 to 8 milligrams of Risperidal a day to a
person with schizophrenia if needed, whereas a person on the autism spec-
trum may receive a dose of 0.5 to 1.0 milligram.
The term atypical refers to the fact that this class of drugs has a much lesser
propensity to cause tardive dyskinesia (TD) and extrapyramidal symptoms
(EPS) — both of which are movement disorders. TD is chronic and can be
irreversible, and EPS is usually short term and disappears over time or with
the discontinuation of the medication.
Not all is known about how atypical antipsychotic drugs function. Some
researchers think that they work on both the serotonin and dopamine sys-
tems. What is known, we present in the following sections.
Common atypical antipsychotic drugs
Here’s a list of some common atypical antipsychotics:

aripiprazole →Abilify
clozapine →Clozaril
olanzapine →Zyprexa
quetiapine →Seroquel
risperidone →Risperidal
ziprasidone →Geodon
Some research studies show that Risperidal is highly effective for reducing
severe rage and aggression in children and adults with autism. Like with
SSRIs (see the previous section), you need to strongly consider using a
smaller than usual starting dose for people with autism. Consider taking up
the dosage issue with a physician if drugs are being prescribed.
Possible atypical antipsychotic side effects
Atypical antipsychotic drugs tend to have more severe side effects than SSRIs
and other autism medications.
In high doses, most of the atypical antipsychotic medications can cause seda-
tion, (generally reversible) weight gain (as much as 30 pounds or more), tar-
dive dyskinesia (TD), extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), Type II diabetes, and
hypotension. The atypicals, especially in antipsychotic doses, can also cause
increases in cholesterol, blood sugar, and fatty acids in the blood. The risks 
of movement disorders increase with the length of time the drug is taken.
Atypical antipsychotic drugs can also cause a life-threatening nervous-system
problem called neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) in very rare cases.
The good news is that people with autism usually don’t require the higher
antipsychotic doses, where the major side effects are much more likely.
Here are a few specific side effects associated with certain atypical antipsy-
chotic drugs:
 Abilify can cause nausea, headache, insomnia, and minimal weight gain
(but generally less EPS).
 Clozaril has less chance of causing EPS than some other atypical
antipsychotic medications, and it can reduce TD from previous medica-
tions, but it causes increased salivation, dizziness, weight gain, hypoten-
sion, and agranulocytosis (a serious condition that requires frequent
blood tests). However, this drug is rarely used for autism.
 Geodon users experience minimal weight gain but present no evidence
of EPS or hypotension.
 Risperidal users have experienced weight gain and face a slightly higher
risk of TD.
103
Chapter 6: Injecting Yourself with Knowledge about Autism Medication

 Seroquel shows no evidence of EPS or minimal weight gain, but the drug
is linked to some sedation and postural hypotension.
 Zyprexa clearly stimulates the appetite, causing obesity.
Tricyclic drugs
Tricyclic drugs used to be a doctor’s first choice for treating depression, but
doctors are now replacing them more and more with SSRIs and other drugs.
However, because tricyclics are highly potent, their use continues, often
when a patient experiences severe depression.
Research has shown that people with autism tend to have a greater incidence
of depression than the general population. In some cases, the depression is
comorbid (existing along with the primary disease or disorder). In other
cases, people with autism may become depressed as they begin to realize
their differences from the majority of the population. The condition becomes
a barrier in developing relationships with others and hinders their ability to
lead a fulfilling and productive life.
In either case, medication can help lift the dark cloud of depression and put
the person with autism on the way to leading a fulfilling and productive life.
Author and Professor Temple Grandin, a person living with autism, reports
that she still uses tricyclics, as she has for the past 25 years at the same low
dose, because they work for her, and she’s not going to change what works!
Common tricyclics
Here are a few common tricyclic drugs:
amitriptyline →Elavil, Endep, Tryptanol
amoxapine →Asendin
clomipramine →Anafranil
desipramine →Norpramin, Pertofrane
doxepin →Adapin, Sinequan
imipramine →Tofranil
nortriptyline →Pamelor
protriptyline →Vivactil
Possible tricyclic side effects
The serious side effects of taking tricyclics are relatively rare. However, they
can include cardiac hazards, which may occur with all tricyclics. Make sure
you find out if your child has any abnormalities in his or her EKG before you
accept a prescription of tricyclics.
104
Part II: Addressing Physical Needs 

Tricyclics can be very dangerous, and possibly fatal, in overdose.
Bothersome, but common, side effects are more likely to occur. The following
effects tend to lessen after about two weeks:
 Dry mouth
 Blurred vision
 Constipation due to slowed digestive processes
Other side effects may include
 Drowsiness
 Excess anxiety
 Difficulty with urination
 Cognition and memory difficulties
 Decrease in sexual libido
 Twitching of muscles
 Nausea
 Increased heart rate and heart rhythm irregularities
Antiepileptics (also known 
as anticonvulsants)
Many people with autism also have epilepsy, a disorder of the brain that
results in recurrent, unprovoked seizures. The term antiepileptics refers to a
class of drugs generally used to prevent epileptic seizures. What makes these
drugs popular is that not only are they helpful to people on the autism spec-
trum with epilepsy, but they also have the ability to stabilize brain activity,
which can assist in the control of aggressive outbursts, explosive behavior,
self injurious behavior, and other challenging behaviors.
Common antiepileptics
Here are some names of different medications that doctors may prescribe for
seizures:
carbamazapine →Tegretol
gabapentin →Neurontin
lamotrigine →Lamictal
leviteracetam →Keppra
valproate →Depakote
105
Chapter 6: Injecting Yourself with Knowledge about Autism Medication

Possible antiepileptic side effects
One of the possible severe side effects of antiepileptics, especially with
Depakote and Tegretol, is liver or bone marrow damage; these drugs require
regular blood testing to make sure no harm is done to the liver and bones.
Here are a few other specific risks and rewards commonly related to certain
medications:
 valproate: In addition to anticonvulsant properties, this drug often helps
reduce aggression and other explosive behaviors, but it also has a seda-
tive effect and can cause an upset stomach and weight gain.
 carbamazapine: This drug has similar effects as valproate and could
create a rash.
 gabapentin and lamotrigine: Both drugs appear to have the same
effects as valproate, including the negative side effects. However, doc-
tors have found insufficient information on how children tolerate the
drugs. They do know, however, that lamotrigine can cause a severe rash.
As you can see from the previous list, some drugs have multiple uses within
the autism spectrum. Sometimes doctors prescribe a drug for an off-label use,
meaning that people take the drug for purposes other than the ones described
on the label. For example, Nardil, an MAO inhibitor not often used anymore,
was initially developed as an antidepressant. However, in the early 1970s, one
doctor noticed that the drug also reduced the intensity of agoraphobia in
patients, so he began prescribing Nardil for that use as well. Clonidine, another
drug, is labeled for use as a high blood pressure treatment, but doctors also
prescribe it to people with autism to deal with anxiety.
Medications for challenging behaviors in
severely affected people with autism
Determining proper medication and other interventions for people more
severely affected with autism can be a difficult task if they lack a form of func-
tional communication to report how they feel. (For more information on com-
municating with someone who has autism, take a look at Chapter 10.) Making
matters worse, people this severely affected experience rage due to their lack
of functionality.
The following list provides some medications that may be helpful in reducing
the rage caused by the inability to develop functional communication skills:
 valproic acid: Also known as Depakene, valproic acid can be helpful in
controlling extreme rages that don’t seem related to specific situations
or persons. The medication also helps in reducing subclinical seizures,
which may be a cause for some rage attacks.
106
Part II: Addressing Physical Needs 

You need to administer high doses of Depakene to achieve effectiveness.
Therefore, you need to monitor for possible liver and blood damage —
especially within the first six months.
 risperidone: Known by the brand name Risperidal, risperidone should
be considered when you or doctors can determine the focus of the rage.
Examples include when a person rages at specific people or situations.
Maximizing Safety When 
Vaccinating Your Child
Vaccines are dead or weakened cells of the toxic bacterium or virus of dis-
eases that medical professionals have deemed worthy of elimination. Children
are routinely vaccinated to eliminate diseases like polio, mumps, and measles.
Some researchers believe that autism can be linked to these immunizations,
or more specifically to thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative in some vac-
cines. The researchers believe this to be true for a certain set of children who
are susceptible to the immunological stress from vaccinations. (For more on
vaccinations as a cause for autism, check out Chapter 3.)
Whether thimerosal causes autism or not, it just doesn’t seem like a good
idea to inject mercury into anybody. Consider verifying that an injection is
thimerosal-free before a doctor gives it to your child, whether he or she has
autism or not, or to you.
Considering your child’s medical history
Before vaccinating your child, consider his or her personal medical history
with these questions:
 Has the child ever had any vaccine reactions?
 Does the child suffer from convulsions or neurological disorders?
 Has the child experienced severe allergies or intolerances to food, med-
ications, or other substances?
 Does the child have any immune-system disorders?
 Is the child currently sick?
And, finally, you need to make sure you have the full information related to
any medication your child takes, including vaccinations.
107
Chapter 6: Injecting Yourself with Knowledge about Autism Medication

Ask yourself these questions:
 Do I have full information on the side effects?
 Do I know how to identify and report a vaccine reaction?
 Do I know the name of the manufacturer and lot number (or batch
number) for researching whether vaccinations from this lot result in an
unusually high number of adverse reactions?
Looking at an alternate 
vaccination schedule
Much of the research centered on reducing the burden that vaccines place on
the immune and other systems of young children points toward adjusting the
timing of the injections. Doing so allows a child’s immune system to properly
develop and safely metabolize the substances contained in the shots. You
may want to consider modifying the vaccination schedule according to
Stephanie Cave’s book What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Children’s
Vaccinations (Warner Books). Take a look at Table 6-1 for the details.

Improving Immunity and 
Boosting Biochemistry
By Jane M. El-Dahr, MD
In This Chapter
 Discovering how the immune system works
 Understanding immune system abnormalities — blood, gut, and brain
 Boosting your (or your loved one’s) immune system
 Benefiting from a biomedical approach
 Removing heavy metals from the body
A
lthough the medical profession long considered autism a disorder only
of the brain, it has become increasingly clear over the last decade that
many affected children have other medical problems in addition to brain
issues. The immune system is out of whack in many autistic children, and the
links between the immune, nervous, and gastrointestinal systems are becom-
ing clearer. Medicine is also putting other symptoms into their proper places.
For example, pain coming from the GI tract may cause some children on the
spectrum to hurt themselves, so self-injurious behavior may have a biologic
rather than behavioral cause. By understanding biochemical abnormalities
and correcting them, doctors and caregivers can improve the level of func-
tioning in an autistic child and marvel at the progress that occurs as the 
child becomes healthier.
In this chapter, you look at how the immune system may “go wrong” in some
children, why their biochemistry may not be optimal, and why investigating
heavy metals in their systems may be helpful. Armed with the information in
this chapter, you should be able to ask your primary physician for some
basic testing, and you’ll be better prepared for the options offered by a physi-
cian who takes a more naturopathic approach. As much as traditional medi-
cine has wanted to divide them, the brain and body are connected!
Much of what we cover in this chapter is still controversial in traditional
medicine because few of these therapies have been proven effective in large 

clinical trials. However, parents (with the guidance of medical professionals)
use many of these approaches regularly, in addition to conventional treat-
ments. The goal for all children on the autism spectrum is maximizing their
potential. Careful consideration of combining appropriate educational
approaches (which we discuss in Part III) with suitable biomedical therapies
is the best way to help them become healthy, happy, and as successful as
they can be.
Taking a Look at the Balancing 
Act of the Immune System
What does the immune system have to do with a neuropsychiatric disorder
like autism, where abnormal behavior is one of the defining components? The
nervous and immune systems have many common features. Both systems
store information in the form of memory and (hopefully!) recall the info when
needed, and the two systems interact at cellular and biochemical levels, shar-
ing many signals. It shouldn’t be a surprise that immune responses can alter
central nervous system (CNS) function, but traditional medicine has been
slow to accept this.
The immune system is the body’s Department of Defense. Its job is to figure
out what’s supposed to be in the body, sometimes called the self, and to try
to get rid of any non-self invaders such as viruses, bacteria, or other foreign
material. The key to a normal immune system is maintaining balance. A
healthy immune system should
 Protect you from all foreign invaders by recognizing an infection in a
rapid fashion and getting rid of it immediately.
 Get smarter over time, remembering that it fought the same infection in
the past if it encounters the bug again.
 Respond to a “stop” signal when the battle should end instead of contin-
uing to fight unnecessarily.
 Never cause any damage to you.
If an infection or disorder disrupts the balance, several things can go wrong
with the immune system, including the following results:
 Immune deficiency/dysfunction: An ineffective or defective response,
often leading to recurrent infections.
 Hypersensitivity: An overactive response of the immune system, dispro-
portionate to the potential danger. The best-known example of hyper-
sensitivity is an allergy, where the body reacts to a harmless stimuli (like
tree pollen) by making antibodies with resulting histamine release.
110
Part II: Addressing Physical Needs 

 Autoimmunity: An inappropriate reaction to self, mistakenly causing
damage to the body. The immune system attacks its own tissues and
cells. Lupus and rheumatoid arthritis are well-known examples of
autoimmune disorders.
111
Chapter 7: Improving Immunity and Boosting Biochemistry
Immunology 101
Here’s a shortcut you can take to master some of
the lingo that doctors and researchers use when
talking about immunology. Although the alphabet
soup language of immunity can be daunting,
keep in mind that it can help you provide the best
care for a child on the autism spectrum (and, hey,
you don’t have to go to medical school!). To make
it easier, you can divide immunology into two
main categories: adaptive and innate.
The adaptive part of the immune system recog-
nizes pathogens and remembers them by using
memory recognition molecules specific for each
germ it has encountered. It “knows” whether a
bacteria is strep (which can cause a sore throat)
or staph (which can cause skin infections). Two
components of the adaptive part of the immune
system are the equivalent of heat-seeking com-
puterized missiles aiming for a specific target:
immunoglobulins and lymphocytes. Medical-
types separate the adaptive immune system into
the immunoglobulin producing portion (Th2) and
the cellular portion (Th1).
Here’s a list of the immunoglobulins and their
functions:
 IgA: Present in tears, saliva, mucus, and in
the gut lining; meant to stop bugs before
they get past the surfaces of the body and
cause infection
 IgM: The “rapid response” protein in the
bloodstream, made rapidly but in small
amounts
 IgG: The main bloodstream protection 
protein
 IgE: Fights parasites but also can cause
allergies
Here are the two kinds of lymphocytes:
 B cells: Make antibodies
 T cells: Orchestrate the overall immune
response
The adaptive system’s goal is to keep the two
sides appropriately functioning and balanced.
The innate part of the immune system is the
older, more primitive and non-specific part that
doesn’t have “memory” for past infections. The
innate side recognizes the surface of germs as
“foreign,” but it doesn’t identify the specific
bacteria it fights — it doesn’t matter to the
innate side whether the germ is strep or staph.
You can think of the cells of the innate system
functioning as though they’re throwing hand
grenades and setting land mines, hitting ene-
mies without caring exactly who the victims are
and sometimes causing collateral damage to
healthy nearby tissue.
Other key components of the immune system are
cytokines — the chemical messages that cells
of the immune system use to communicate with
each other. Just as the nervous system uses
neurotransmitters for cellular communication
and the endocrine system uses circulating hor-
mones, the immune system uses cytokines to
coordinate an “attack”. Some cytokines “turn
on” parts of the system, and others serve as “off”
signals. Cytokine function in the GI tract is par-
ticularly important because the majority of the
immune cells of the body reside there.

 Inflammation: Overactivity of the immune system, causing “bystander”
damage to normal tissue while it tries to repair an injury or get rid of an
infection. For example, when a splinter gets under your skin, the redness,
swelling, tenderness, and warmth appear because of inflammation as
your cells attack the piece of wood and repair the surrounding skin. If
inflammation doesn’t turn off when your body no longer needs it for heal-
ing, it becomes chronic and can cause damage to nearby healthy tissue.
Because autism is classified as a neuropsychiatric disorder, looking at how the
immune system plays a role in a somewhat similar medical condition can be
helpful. A well-characterized example of a neuropsychiatric disorder caused by
an errant immune reaction is Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder
Associated with Streptococcus, or PANDAS. PANDAS is an autoimmune condi-
tion that occurs when previously healthy school-aged children suddenly
develop obsessive compulsive disorder or Tourette’s Syndrome (tics) following
a bout of strep throat. The child’s immune system gets rid of the strep bacteria
by making antibodies to target the germ. However, by mistake, these antibodies
also attack part of the brain, which leads to changes in behavior. By treating
the strep infection with antibiotics and, if that isn’t enough, the immune system
with intravenous immunoglobulin, doctors can modulate the overreaction,
diminishing the psychiatric symptoms. (For more on comorbid [or coexisting]
conditions or conditions that resemble autism, check out Chapter 2.)
Exposing the Relationship between
Autism and Immune Abnormalities
Although the relationship between autism and the immune system is complex
and not yet fully understood, experts have found important clues based on
studies of the blood, gut, and brain that may someday help pinpoint the origins
of the disorder. Cytokines, the communication cells of the immune system, play
a key role in the central nervous system, influencing mood, sleep, and appetite
and in some cases acting as growth factors for nerves. Three bodily systems —
the gut, the brain, and the immune system — “interpret” many of the same sig-
nals as they interface with the outside world, and fixing problems in one area
may improve the functioning of all three systems. We should all hope to under-
stand autism better in the future, but for now, treating immune problems that
cause frequent infections or allergies may make a child feel better now and
enable him to learn more during therapy or at school.
All four categories in the unfortunate game of “Immune System Gone Wrong” —
deficiency, hypersensitivity, autoimmunity, and inflammation (see the previous
section) — often appear in children on the autism spectrum. We explore 
these categories and other areas within the blood, gut, and brain in the 
following sections.
112
Part II: Addressing Physical Needs 

Analyzing immune measurements 
in the blood
In children with autism, more studies explore the immune measurements in
blood than in the GI tract or brain (see the following sections “Exploring gut
problems” and “Studying brain tissue”). Experts have found many types 
of immune abnormalities in autistic children by analyzing blood samples, 
such as
 Deficiencies causing increased infections
 Allergies
 Autoimmunity
 Overactivation
However, doctors have seen a great deal of individual variation when it
comes to autism and the immune system. The following sections break 
down the most common findings in autistic children. (For a guide on how 
to take this information and use it to improve the health of your child, see 
the upcoming section “Improving Immunity”.)
Infections
A significant number of autistic children have recurrent infections — especially
ear infections — that start at an early age. The most common medical his-
tory given by parents is that the child was treated with multiple courses of
antibiotics as an infant and toddler. More often than in typical children with a
similar history, children with autism have immune deficiency with low
immunoglobulin levels.
The most common finding is a low IgA level (measured in the blood but doing
its work in tears, saliva, mucus, and in the gut lining), predisposing the child
to respiratory and GI infections; some children have low IgG and/or IgM
levels as well.
Immune cell numbers and function are also frequently low, making the chil-
dren more prone to infections with viruses or yeast.
Allergies
Some people on the autism spectrum — especially those with eczema (or
atopic dermatitis, a noncontagious skin condition), asthma, or a constant
runny nose — have high levels of the immunoglobulin IgE and multiple aller-
gies. Many allergies are caused by food or by indoor and outdoor allergens
(like pet dander, dust mites, and pollen).
113
Chapter 7: Improving Immunity and Boosting Biochemistry

Autoimmunity
Several researchers have found that children with autism make autoantibod-
ies to brain components (brain proteins, neurotransmitters or receptors, the
myelin coating around nerve cells, and other things), but the significance of
this connection remains uncertain. Researchers have found no clear evidence
to date that the antibodies are directly attacking the brain or causing symp-
toms; however, they know that it isn’t normal for the antibodies to be present
in the bloodstream.
Additionally, doctors have observed an increased incidence of autoimmune
diseases such as Hashimoto’s (autoimmune) thyroiditis or rheumatoid arthri-
tis in families of children on the autism spectrum when compared to families
without affected children. Based both on these studies and on research deal-
ing with immune function genes, there appears to be a genetic predisposition
to autoimmunity in the families of children with autism.
Immune activation
Recent research has confirmed that signs of inflammation and activation, espe-
cially of the innate branch of the immune system (see the sidebar “Immunology
101”), are very common findings. One researcher, Dr. Jyonouchi, found that milk
components (or wheat) cause the release of inflammatory cytokines (immune
messages) from blood cells in many children with autism. Unfortunately, this
research is only preliminary, and no test is available that detects every child
on the autism spectrum with food sensitivity or predicts fully which child will
benefit from a milk-free, wheat-free, or other type of diet. (For more informa-
tion on addressing your child’s dietary needs, check out Chapter 8.)
Exploring gut problems
Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms of different types occur in many children with
autism. Researchers have observed bloating, gas, abdominal pain, chronic diar-
rhea, chronic constipation, or a combination of problems in up to half of stud-
ied children with autism. Gastro-esophageal reflux (heartburn) is also common
and may cause ulcers, leading to night awakenings from pain. Abnormal bowel
movements — stools that have the texture of chocolate pudding instead of
holding form like play dough or that contain visible undigested food — also
occur in many cases.
The intestinal lining is the barrier between the contents of the gut and the
bloodstream that filters nutrients into the blood. In a healthy gut, the cells in
the lining are close together so that the spaces between are small, like a tea
strainer rather than a colander. Damage to the intestinal lining (from an infec-
tion, allergy, or inflammation) can cause increased intestinal permeability, or
leaky gut, so that incompletely digested proteins leak into the bloodstream
where the immune system can “see” them and react to them. Increased gut
permeability, first described in children with autism in 1996 but confirmed
114
Part II: Addressing Physical Needs 

later by several researchers, is more common in autistic children than in the
general population. It isn’t clear what starts the process, but it’s likely that
trying to “calm down” the immune system in the gut would help stop the
leakiness, which would further dampen the overstimulated immune system
because fewer foreign proteins would get into the bloodstream.
Not every autistic child with gastrointestinal symptoms has immune reactiv-
ity to food, however, and not every autistic child with immune reactivity to
food has gastrointestinal symptoms, so which children would benefit from
dietary intervention remains very difficult to predict, but even the main-
stream Journal of Pediatrics (May 2005) published an editorial featuring scien-
tific findings “to support the rather ‘gray’ [rather than black and white]
literature on unusual dietary responses in autism.”
At the very least, children with frequent gastrointestinal symptoms or who
seem to have frequent abdominal pain — doubling over unexpectedly, press-
ing their abdomens against furniture or the floor, crying with bowel move-
ments, or waking up in the middle of the night crying — need an evaluation
by a pediatric gastroenterologist. If your child has gastrointestinal symptoms,
ask your primary care provider for a referral to a pediatric gastroenterolo-
gist. If that isn’t possible, ask for a comprehensive stool analysis test, which
can be of great help in determining if your child’s digestion is normal, what (if
any) pathogens are present, and what treatments may help. Ask your doctor
for more information about this test (although traditional physicians may not
be as familiar with it as alternative practitioners may be).
Dr. Andrew Wakefield described (and others have verified his research) the
presence of lympho-nodular hyperplasia (LNH) in the GI tracts of a group of
children with autism who had a history of regression. The glands (or lymph
nodes) in the lining of the gut become swollen with the presence of abnormal
populations of lymphocytes and inflammatory cytokines (immune system
cells) like TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor) in large amounts. The inflammation
of the small and large bowel (enterocolitis) is similar to, but not the same as,
what’s seen in inflammatory bowel disease. The most controversial finding of
all is the discovery of the measles virus present in the swollen nodes of the
gut. Until researchers repeat Dr. Wakefield’s study and confirm or deny his
findings, the debate over the role of the measles virus and the MMR vaccine
in autism will rage on.
Studying brain tissue
In 2005, researchers at Johns Hopkins University, using tissue samples taken
during autopsy, observed immune changes in the brains of patients with
autism. They found that cells that function as innate immune and support
cells for neurons — called microglia and astrocytes — showed immune activa-
tion and inflammation (see the sidebar “Immunology 101” earlier in this chap-
ter for more technical info).
115
Chapter 7: Improving Immunity and Boosting Biochemistry

Although researchers have found brain autoantibodies in the bloodstreams 
of autistic children in other studies (see the section “Analyzing immune 
measurements in the blood”), the Hopkins researchers didn’t find any in 
the brains in their study. It’s possible that when the Hopkins patients were
younger, the adaptive parts of their immune systems may have been involved
as well. However, the researchers haven’t found any specific “markers” (which
may be found if the adaptive part of the immune system was involved) to pin-
point what started the immune responses in the brains. The researchers think
that a toxin, infection, or maternal infection during pregnancy may have initi-
ated the processes. It remains unknown whether the immune activation starts
in the brain or occurs in response to a stimulus from somewhere else, such as
the gut.
Finding inflammation opens up the possibility of potential medical treatments
at some point in the future and broadens researchers’ thinking about the
causes of autism (see Chapter 3). However, Hopkins researchers point out
that no specific therapy can “undo” the brain findings at this time. The Johns
Hopkins group has a technical but informative Web site on “FAQs regarding
the meaning of neuroinflammatory findings in autism” at www.neuro.jhmi.
edu/neuroimmunopath/autism_faqs.htm; hopefully they’ll post more
information as their research advances.
Other researchers have reported intriguing findings as well. One small study
published in 2004 documented that autistic children who had previously
shown the measles virus in their GI tracts also had the measles virus in their
spinal fluid. Another research group found autoantibodies in the brain itself,
present in the lining of brain blood vessels. Demonstrating specific immune
abnormalities gives researchers clues to potential biomedical treatments that
may be helpful to these children. Currently, studies have created far more
questions than answers, but hopefully these answers are imminent and in
turn will lead to the development of specific new therapies.
Improving Immunity
If a child with autism is sick and feels bad — especially if he’s in pain from
chronic constipation, gut inflammation, or ear infection — his behavior 
may worsen because he feels terrible and can’t concentrate. The “double
whammy” is that on top of all this, the child can’t communicate what’s wrong
because of the autism itself, leading to even more frustration and negative
behavior. Treating these immune-system symptoms can help the child’s over-
all level of functioning and behavior. In this section, we look at first-line,
second-line, and third-line strategies for treatment of immune system issues
in autistic children.
116
Part II: Addressing Physical Needs 

Some of the things we discuss here are mainstream and apply to any child
with similar symptoms. Other options have only anecdotal evidence in terms
of helping children on the autism spectrum, but they may or may not be
worth considering based on your child’s symptoms and your pocketbook sit-
uation (in other words, many of the treatments can be expensive). Hopefully,
you can find a sympathetic medical professional to help you sort through
these potential therapies (see Chapters 4 and 6 for more on finding the right
medical care).
Each child with autism is different, which means professionals must evaluate
each child for his or her particular group of symptoms and laboratory abnor-
malities. Medicine can’t give you a “one-size-fits-all” therapy, but it can give
you many therapies and strategies that can improve your child’s situation
and help him achieve his optimal level of functioning. Some first-line thera-
pies benefit most children and are fairly simple to implement, and other
second- and third-line interventions require prescribed medication and close
supervision by medical professionals.
Focusing on first-line fundamentals
You, the autistic child’s caregiver (or the autistic adult, in the flesh), are the
first line of defense when it comes to improving the immune system. Eating 
a well-balanced diet as “naturally” as possible (see Chapter 8) is a good 
start, but you have many tactics at your disposal. The following list shows
first-line strategies you can consider implementing on your own. The strate-
gies are generally safe and not terribly expensive, and (except for the dietary
changes) they’re proven to support and regulate the immune system in other
similar disorders (no large trials have been conducted in autism).
You should discuss these strategies with your healthcare provider. Most
physicians are at least a little familiar with them, but professionals who use a
naturopathic approach (even if they’ve never treated children with autism)
are the most knowledgeable options.
 Deciding on a diet: Although committing to a specific diet is daunting,
and you have no perfect way to determine how your family will benefit,
giving your loved one a healthy diet containing few additives or
processed foods is a good step toward boosting his immune system. 
If a food stimulates your child’s immune system, avoiding it can only
improve his condition. At the very least, you should consider a trial of
complete avoidance of milk, because it seems to be the most common
culprit; however, you should strongly consider eliminating any other
suspect food (see Chapter 8 for more on changing a diet). Note: A child
avoiding milk should get 500 to 600 milligrams of calcium twice a day,
either by calcium-fortified orange juice or with a supplement. Digestive
enzymes, like EnZym-Complete/DPPIV/Isogest, may be beneficial, but
they aren’t substitutes for removing offending foods completely.

Chapter 7: Improving Immunity and Boosting Biochemistry

 Protecting with probiotics: The “good” bacteria in the gut are very
important in regulating the gastrointestinal tract. Frequent antibiotic use
(common for autistic children) kills these helpful bacteria, but you can
replace them with over-the-counter supplements (look for Lactobacillus
or Bifidobacterium listed as ingredients) or live-culture yogurt (found in
health-food stores; this yogurt isn’t for those avoiding milk). Such prod-
ucts, known as probiotics, have been widely used in combating inflamma-
tory bowel disease and infectious diarrhea. Probiotics increase IgA
levels in the gut and regulate immune signals, decreasing intestinal per-
meability and inflammation (see the sidebar “Immunology 101”).
Try live rather than freeze-dried brands of probiotics in your local
health-food store (found with the refrigerated supplements), or order
brands like Pro-Bio Gold or Culturelle online from suppliers specializing
in products for children with autism. Aim for at least 1 billion bacteria
per day. Try casein-free supplements containing a single strain of bacte-
ria or those with mixed strains — whichever works better for your child.
Often, rotating brands can help, so just buy a one-month supply until
you get gut symptoms under control.
 Employing EFAs: Essential fatty acids (EFAs), especially omega 3s, lower
pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and they help to seal gut leaks. Fish
oil is a good source of omega 3, but you need to be sure it’s mercury-free
(it should say on the packaging). Start with 1,000 to 2,000 milligrams per
day of two common omega 3 fatty acids combined — eicosapentaenoic
acid (EPA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA).
 Adding antioxidants: Combating inflammation with antioxidant vita-
mins, such as A, C, and E, and using antioxidant supplements, like 
Co-Q10 (a coenzyme that has a similar structure to vitamin K and acts as
a catalyst for energy production; give 10 to 25 mg daily), can help regu-
late the immune system and decrease inflammation. 
Some naturopathic physicians have used a short “blast” of high-dose vit-
amin A with success, but you should attempt this only under supervi-
sion because vitamin A can be toxic at large doses; see the following
sections for more complicated therapies.
Seeking out second-line strategies
Even if you see improvement with the first-line defenses you enact to
improve your child’s immune system (see the previous section), your child
may require additional strategies to relieve pain or experience greater
improvement. Here are a few second-line options that may be trickier to per-
form on your own or require a prescription, a referral to a specialist, or spe-
cialized testing:
118
Part II: Addressing Physical Needs 

 Defeating dysbiosis: Dysbiosis occurs when normally harmless bacteria
and yeasts cause disease by altering the nutrition or immune responses
of the host. Getting rid of pathogens in the gut calms down the immune
system and helps GI symptoms. Appropriate antibiotics, used judi-
ciously, have been shown to decrease autistic symptoms. However, the
effects are not permanent, so you should use other means to keep
abnormal bacteria from coming back after your child completes the
course of antibiotics. Prescription antifungal medications, especially
short courses, and antiyeast supplements, such as garlic derivatives or
the “friendly” yeast (saccharomyces boulardii), can help if the situation
doesn’t improve after you try the first-line therapies.
 Contemplating colostrum: Children with low IgA levels (see the sidebar
“Immunology 101”) or those with more severe chronic diarrhea may need
extra help in tackling gut issues. Hopefully, you can get a referral to a 
gastroenterologist, but if you can’t or you want to improve the situation
while you wait for an appointment with the specialist, other therapies may
help. Colostrum, a supplement containing a concentrated derivative of
cow’s milk that features high levels of helpful antibodies, can help chronic
gastrointestinal symptoms or dysbiosis if other approaches don’t help,
although it should be certified casein-free if your child is avoiding milk.
Another approach is to take intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), the
same product used to treat immune deficiency, and put it in capsules for
oral use so that it fights pathogens in the gut. A trial of a commercial
product is currently underway (see the next section for more on IVIG).
 Attacking allergies: Nasal allergies have been shown to affect concen-
tration and memory, two important issues for autistic children. Doctors
should test children with chronic runny noses, asthma, eczema, or
recurrent ear infections and sinusitis for traditional allergies with skin
testing or with a blood radioallergosorbent test (RAST). If you choose,
you can avoid allergens and try treatment with nonsedating antihista-
mines or antiinflammatory allergy medications (like Singulair).
 Investigating infections: Doctors should evaluate children on the autism
spectrum who have recurrent infections just like typical children — by
measuring immunoglobulin levels and conducting allergy testing.
 Modifying metals: If you’ve found that heavy metals influence your
child’s immune system, it makes sense to remove them. (Check out the
section “Getting the Lead [and Mercury] Out” later in this chapter for
more information.)
Tackling third-line therapies
Some aggressive therapies may become necessary when simpler, more con-
trolled therapies (see the previous two sections) aren’t working. Typically,
such third-line-of-defense therapies are appropriate or accessible only for
119
Chapter 7: Improving Immunity and Boosting Biochemistry

some children, as determined by a physician. Here’s a list of aggressive thera-
pies you and your doctor may discuss:
 Colitis therapy: For children who have severe gut inflammation (known
as colitis), which is diagnosed by a gastroenterologist, your doctor may
prescribe antiinflammatory medications normally used to combat
inflammatory bowel disease.
 Antiviral agents: It isn’t possible at the time of this book to fully define
the significance of viruses in autism. The role of chronic viral infections
and the efficacy of antiviral agents are still matters of dispute. However,
you may consider a trial of an antiviral medication if your autistic child
seems to lose skills at the time of a viral infection. Anecdotally antiviral
drugs benefit some children, but many of these medications have side
effects on neurotransmitters and on the brain, so how they work or for
whom isn’t clear.
Until doctors resolve the debate, children on the autism spectrum can
get blood tests to see if they have adequate responses to their first 
MMR (the combined vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella) 
to determine if they need boosters at age 4 or 5 years instead of getting
it automatically.
 IVIG: Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a blood product containing
antibodies pooled from many donors, is very helpful in combating infec-
tions in children whose own immunoglobulin levels are low. Even if it
doesn’t directly improve symptoms of autism, it should dramatically
decrease the severity and frequency of infections in children with low
IgG levels and help the children to feel much better. Doctors should give
IVIG to immunodeficient children with autism just as they would to chil-
dren with the same low immunoglobulin levels who don’t have autism.
Dr. Gupta from the University of California noted improvements in 
functioning in some autistic children who received replacement (low-
dose) IVIG.
Doctors also may use high-dose IVIG in autoimmune disorders (includ-
ing PANDAS) to modulate the immune system; this treatment also has
been reported to benefit some autistic children, especially those with
high levels of brain autoantibodies, although researchers have only
anecdotal evidence at this time.
IVIG therapy is very, very expensive and is rarely covered by insurance.
Also, an experienced physician should supervise this treatment because
too high a dose can cause low white-blood counts and other adverse
effects.
 Other aggressive options: Now that researchers have found some evi-
dence of inflammation and immune activation in a number of the brains
of autistic children, specific therapies proven useful in treating other
neurologic disorders with similar findings are under investigation. Keep
watching for new developments.

Part II: Addressing Physical Needs 

Biochemistry Begets Behavior: 
A New Way of Thinking
The traditional view is that autism is a group of behaviors caused by some
defective gene or genes that enacted structural changes in the brain before
the child was born. Traditional thinking dictates that because doctors can’t
repair structural brain abnormalities, they can do nothing to improve the
child’s level of functioning other than providing behavioral therapies.
The biomedical approach toward autism is based on a different idea — that
autistic children have metabolic problems that doctors can diagnose and
treat. Fixing broken biochemical pathways improves the immune system and
helps to heal the gut, making the child feel better physically. Biomedical
thinking insists that by paying attention to the medical (as opposed to only
the psychiatric) issues of the children, along with the psychiatric and educa-
tional facets, caregivers and physicians can significantly improve the chil-
dren’s quality of life and their levels of functioning.
Because the idea of taking on biochemistry may seem even more daunting
than tackling immunology, it helps to visualize biochemical pathways as
roads taking a molecule from point A to point B to interact with another mol-
ecule. The body may provide three different possible paths or only one way
to get there. Genetic variations contribute to how effectively molecules get
from A to B — the average person’s pathway may be the equivalent of having
two lanes in each direction, and someone with “super” efficiency may repre-
sent an expressway. For many critical pathways, children with autism seem
to have one-lane roads, so the metabolism isn’t very efficient. On top of that,
autistic kids experience environmental issues that reduce the efficiency even
more by changing road conditions or blocking parts of the path, causing bio-
chemical gridlock.
The following sections address the pathway issues autistic children face and
how their metabolism functions as a result.
Shedding light on the broken pathways
Blocked biochemical pathways affect an autistic child in many ways —
decreasing normal cellular energy production, for example, or decreasing the
body’s ability to get rid of toxic substances effectively. How much a block
affects a child’s body depends on how important the pathway is. If you’re late
getting to the barbershop, the consequence of letting your hair grow another
day isn’t the same as the consequence of not making it to the airport on time
and missing a flight.
121
Chapter 7: Improving Immunity and Boosting Biochemistry

Research indicates that the two most-affected pathways in children with
autism are methylation and sulfation:
 Methylation is the process of making a molecule longer by adding a
carbon. This step is necessary for regulating DNA synthesis and
enzymes, building neurotransmitters, synchronizing the firing of neu-
rons, and creating cellular energy. Methylation is abnormal in the major-
ity of children with autism.
 Sulfation is part of the biochemical pathway necessary for the removal
of toxins from the body. It helps “pick up” waste molecules to dispose of
them.
Another proven problem in children with autism is oxidative stress, equiva-
lent to rust in the gears of metabolism. The stress is a chemical state result-
ing from inflammation, which keeps molecules “stuck” instead of easily
bonding with each other.
Maximizing metabolism
It isn’t easy to make neurotransmitters or any other molecules if the bio-
chemical system is blocked and inefficient, so we know that biochemistry
directly influences behavior. By measuring specific molecules and supple-
menting deficient components of the pathways, doctors can optimize metab-
olism so that behavior improves. For some children, metabolic deficiencies
may be genetic. In others, a picky diet or poor absorption of nutrients
through the gut is the problem.
Trying to normalize biochemical pathways can help improve overall 
functioning — you won’t find a list of specific benefits for each supplement.
You should discuss the approaches we present with your healthcare provider,
but a practitioner with a naturopathic approach may be necessary to provide
some of the options. Currently, studies are small, and available results are
mostly anecdotal, but researchers like Jill James, Richard Deth, James Adams,
and others are rapidly expanding the science behind the anecdotes.
Here are some things you can give to your child to improve metabolism and
unblock the pathways causing problems:
 Vitamins: Vitamin levels are abnormal in many children with autism; it
isn’t unreasonable to consider supplementing, especially for children
with poor diets, because many vitamins are necessary factors in multi-
ple biochemical pathways. Such vitamins include
• Antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E
• The B vitamins to repair methylation, especially B6 (pyridoxine) or
its active form P5P (pyridoxal 5-phosphate)
122
Part II: Addressing Physical Needs 

• B12 (cobalamin in the form methyl-cobalamin)
• Folic acid, or its active form, folinic acid
The simplest way to make sure your child has all these vitamins is by
administering a multivitamin developed specifically for children on the
spectrum, although methyl-B12 needs to be given by injection or nasal
spray. An excellent resource for more information on doses for both 
vitamins and minerals (including appropriate multivitamins) is
www.eas.asu.edu/~autism (go to the Advice link). You can also
check out the Appendix in this book for more excellent resources.
 Minerals: Zinc and selenium levels are low in most autistic children, so
you should ask your doctor about supplementing them while avoiding
copper. Magnesium helps vitamin B6 function, and calcium supplemen-
tation is important for children on a milk-free diet.
 Amino acids: Measuring the child’s blood amino-acid profile and supple-
menting as needed can help his body make proteins optimally, which
improves metabolic functioning. Cysteine, the building block for gluta-
thione, is frequently low in autistic children, but you can bolster it indi-
rectly with the help of an experienced practitioner (it may not be well
tolerated by itself).
 Antioxidants: Omega 3 fatty acids are frequently low in autistic children.
(For more info on omega 3, see the section “Focusing on first-line funda-
mentals” earlier in this chapter.)
 Glutathione: Comprised of a string of three amino acids — cysteine,
glycine, and glutamic acid — glutathione is the most important antioxi-
dant inside cells of the body. Glutathione is critical for detoxification and
energy production but is low in the majority of children on the autism
spectrum (Jill James, 2005 and 2006). A naturopathic practitioner can
discuss whether giving glutathione directly or boosting levels indirectly
is the best approach for your child.
 DMG/TMG (Dimethylglycine and Trimethylglycine): Both of these sup-
plements, which are available in health-food stores or through compa-
nies specializing in supplements for children with autism, help
methylation, the most frequently “stuck” biochemical pathway. Consider
starting with DMG, giving 125 mg once or twice daily.
 Melatonin: Melatonin is the body’s sleep hormone and can help boost
methylation. Start with 1 to 3 mg of melatonin (available in health-food
stores) by mouth 30 minutes before bedtime. You can give it daily or
intermittently, depending on how your child responds, particularly in
children who have problems falling asleep.
Every child with autism is an individual, and most children are very sensitive
to any changes in their systems, so you need to go “low and slow” when it
comes to supplements or medications. Don’t start everything at one time;
wait at least two weeks before you add another supplement to the mix, and
keep written records of your impressions of each supplement.
123
Chapter 7: Improving Immunity and Boosting Biochemistry

You may not want to tell your child’s therapists or teachers about specific
treatments you give, because their impressions of any improvements or set-
backs in behavior or mood can be very helpful in deciding if the treatments
have any benefit. Keep track of the observations made by people who are
“blind” to any medical therapies in your written records. You should, how-
ever, keep your child’s doctor in the loop for safety purposes.
Getting the Lead (and Mercury) Out
One of the most controversial topics in autism is the role of heavy metals in the
disorder, with mercury being the most publicized and politicized. In addition to
vaccines, exposure to mercury can come indirectly from the pregnant mother
from fish eaten, dental fillings, or immunizations during the pregnancy — such
as the flu shot or rhogam, given to mothers with Rh incompatability.
Other heavy metals also seem to be a problem for some children. Lead —
found in the soil in many parts of the country from lead paint and leaded
gasoline — and arsenic (a preservative in wood used on playgrounds) are
particularly common.
Of note, exposure to heavy metals (with mercury being the best studied)
causes far more abnormalities in animals with a genetic predisposition toward
autoimmunity than in those without it (as is the case in children with autism).
Additionally, animals and humans exposed to heavy metals often make anti-
brain autoantibodies, especially with the right (or wrong, really) genetic back-
ground. Infections, either viral or bacterial, can also trigger autoimmunity in
some disorders. Heavy metals can make viral infections more virulent and
become chronic. The parallels between the immune system dysfunction in
children on the autism spectrum and those seen in animals exposed to small
doses of mercury are hard to ignore.
Why the autistic child?
The mercury-containing preservative thimerosal was used in routine child-
hood vaccines for decades, but the amount given increased in the early
1990s. But if all infants in the early 1990s received the same vaccines, why
didn’t every child get poisoned? Are children with autism “canaries in the
coal mine” as the world becomes more toxic? Perhaps so. Several
researchers have shown in the early 21st century that at least some children
with autism have more heavy metals stored in their bodies, most likely
because they have minimal ability to get rid of them through the body’s
detoxification system. Their biochemical and metabolic irregularities — such
as low glutathione — interfere with the normal process of eliminating toxins
and heavy metals, so without fixing the “broken” biochemistry, they continue
124
Part II: Addressing Physical Needs 

to be more vulnerable to harm than other children, regardless of how they
were exposed. (For more on biochemistry and metabolism, see the previous
section.)
It’s possible to give a medication to “pull out” heavy metals from the body,
using medications called chelators, in order to measure whether unusual
amounts of metals are present (see the final section of this chapter).
Although it’s still a highly controversial area, chelation is a potential option
to explore for your child with autism.
Testing for toxicity
A provocation test, where doctors give your child a dose or several doses of
an agent (called a chelator) that pulls metals out of the body — with urine
collected before and after — is the most common way to demonstrate an
abnormally high body burden of heavy metals. Not every child with a high
level of metals or who ultimately benefits from removal of metals has a posi-
tive provocative test, and many children excrete other metals such as lead or
arsenic before the test “pulls” any mercury out. As a result, this type of test-
ing isn’t well accepted by mainstream physicians; families who are interested
need to find an experienced naturopathic practitioner to explore this option.
Traditional ways to test for heavy metals in the body include analyses of
blood, hair, or urine. These tests turn up positive if the person is continually
being exposed to a metal, such as with children who play in dirt contami-
nated by lead paint chips. But the tests aren’t helpful if the exposure
occurred in the past (because the metals have moved into the tissues instead
of remaining in the bloodstream) or if the child has a fundamental problem in
excreting the metal — both of which are likely true for children with autism.
Metals stored in the body are notoriously difficult to detect because they’re
sequestered (or hidden). Measuring stored metals requires giving a “provok-
ing” agent first.
Chelating
Chelation (pronounced kee-lay-shun) is the process of removing a heavy metal
from the body via the bloodstream by using a medication that binds to the
metal, allowing the body to excrete it through urine or stool. Many anecdotal
reports from parents and clinicians indicate that the removal of toxic heavy
metals has benefited a significant number of children with autism, although
much controversy remains. Because no medication is specifically approved
by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to remove mercury, naturopathic
doctors currently use a number of agents, or chelators, by different routes —
by mouth, intravenously, by suppository, or by a cream applied to the skin.
125
Chapter 7: Improving Immunity and Boosting Biochemistry

Here’s a list of the most common chelators:
 DMSA (dimercaptosuccinnic acid, or Chemet): FDA approved for
removing lead in children with high lead levels and used for mercury
poisoning in the United States. Published data supports its ability to pull
mercury from autistic children. A great deal of anecdotal data currently
indicates that DMSA also helps improve autistic symptoms, especially if
given before adolescence. A controlled trial — where a treatment is com-
pared in a head-to-head way with a “dummy” treatment, or placebo, to
prove the treatment’s effectiveness — is underway as of this writing.
 DMPS (sodium dimercaptopropanesulfonate): Not FDA approved for
use in the United States, but doctors use it in Europe to treat mercury
toxicity. DMPS may be better at removing mercury from the body than
DMSA, but the safety profile isn’t as well established. DMPS can be made
to order by a compounding pharmacy (one where the pharmacist is
licensed to specifically prepare individualized prescriptions instead of
dispensing “ready-made” manufactured medications as a traditional
pharmacy does) in the United States with a physician’s order.
 TTFD (thiamine tetrahydrofurfuryl disulfide, or Alithiamine): A deriva-
tive of vitamin B1 (thiamine), TTFD isn’t approved by the FDA except as
an investigational drug for use in autism, but you may be able to obtain
it from a compounding pharmacy if ordered by a physician. TTFD is
most commonly applied to the skin, and a pharmacist can compound it
with glutathione.
This chelator is very safe, but many patients will have a skunky odor if
they excrete metals bound to TTFD, so most people apply it at night and
shower in the morning.
 EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid): This chelator is particularly
effective for removal of lead, but only a physician who’s very familiar
with how to give EDTA safely should administer it because mistakes can
be life-threatening.
126
Part II: Addressing Physical Needs 
Examining the mercury hypothesis
A very important study supporting the “mercury
hypothesis” of autism came from Columbia
University in New York. Researchers took infant
mice and mimicked the childhood vaccine sched-
ule of the early 1990s, injecting baby mice with
doses of the mercury preservative thimerosal —
doses equivalent to those American infants
received in the first six months of life. Results
showed that animals with a genetic predisposi-
tion to autoimmunity had significant changes both
in behavior and in brain structure; mice with a
genetic resistance to autoimmunity had no
abnormalities. Interestingly, both genetics and
exposure to the metal were necessary. The fact
that researchers observed these effects in mice
in the same brain areas found to be abnormal in
children with autism — even though they injected
the mercury after the animals were born — is
provocative.

 Sprays: Several spray formulations for chelation are available on the
market, but efficacy isn’t as well documented with the sprays as with the
other chelating agents.
It’s wise to approach chelation knowing as much as possible. An excellent
resource is www.autismwebsite.com/ARI/vaccine/heavymetals.pdf,
which gives in-depth information.
First and foremost, to obtain a provocation challenge test (see the previous
section) or to pursue chelating as ongoing treatment, you need to find an
experienced healthcare practitioner to guide you through the process and
individualize the treatment plan. Don’t be afraid to ask around!
Before beginning chelation . . .
To make chelation safe and effective, complete these steps first before admin-
istering a chelating agent and after meeting with the practitioner who will
guide you through the process (consult with your physician if you’re already
giving chelators and haven’t taken these steps):
 Start vitamin and mineral supplements, because chelators will remove
zinc and essential minerals in addition to the heavy metals.
 Clean out your child’s gut as much as possible, especially alleviating
constipation, if you will give the chelator by mouth.
 Boost antioxidant and glutathione levels (see the section “Maximizing
metabolism”).
 Make sure that your child has minimal ongoing exposure to toxins. For
example, the child shouldn’t eat large fish such as tuna. If the child
needs to have a tooth filled during treatment, ask for porcelain or non-
silver amalgams. And make sure that immunizations given to the child
have trace or no thimerosal.
Although vaccines in the 1990s and before used thimerosal (mercury) as
a preservative, routine childhood vaccines in the United States no
longer contain more than trace mercury (with the exception of the flu
vaccine, which is available with and without). Vaccination is important
and saves lives, but you need to know what’s being given to your child.
Understanding the chelation caveats
Although many children with autism excrete significant amounts of heavy
metals during chelation and see the benefits, researchers have little evidence
that any chelating agent can remove mercury from the brain. Because many
of the chelating medications are also powerful antioxidants and help to
restore sulfation chemistry, there may be more than one mode of action
taking place.
127
Chapter 7: Improving Immunity and Boosting Biochemistry

Chelators have potential side effects, such as skin rashes or alterations of
liver chemistries. Children should always be under medical supervision when
undergoing chelation. They should be monitored with regular blood counts
and liver-function tests, and doctors should check them to make sure that
needed minerals like zinc are being replaced.

Optimizing Nutrition
With Jane M. El-Dahr, MD, and Lauren Underwood, PhD
In This Chapter
 Keeping your dietary expectations in check
 Eliminating offending foods from your child’s diet
 Considering going wheat and dairy free
 Introducing supplements to balance the diet
 Reviewing implementation strategies for your child’s diet
You are what you eat. How many times have you heard that expression?
We’re guessing a ton. People love to throw it around because what we
eat has such a profound effect on how we feel and behave. And diet may just
be able to help cure what ails us. What are we getting at? Well, we’re here to
talk about the role of nutrition in autism.
Parents of children with autism and adults with autism have noticed that
dietary interventions — such as eliminating wheat and dairy products
(common food allergens), adding supplements, or both — can go so far as to
reduce autistic symptoms in some people. The autistic person’s digestion can
improve, and the diet can have positive effects on behavior, moods, and over-
all functioning.
In this chapter, we look at some of the dietary approaches that have worked
for people and how you can implement them. We talk about changing a child’s
diet, but you can apply any of the advice we present to autistic adults, too.
The approaches we introduce are safe — if you ensure that a medical doctor,
nutritionist, or other qualified person supervises their use. You don’t need
prescriptions for any intervention we suggest. As a matter of fact, at times, the
most difficult part of this journey may not be the actual diet itself, but han-
dling your hopes and expectations, especially in a skeptical environment.
The mounting evidence of the positive effect diet can have is leading to inter-
esting new findings in the area of autism theories (see Chapters 2 and 3 for
more information), but as of this writing, experts don’t have a great deal of
data regarding the interaction of diet and autism. An October 2005 editorial

and study published in The Journal of Pediatrics noted that the GF/CF dietary
intervention (which we explain in this chapter) appears to help some autistic
individuals. Although you won’t find any peer-reviewed research to support
every recommendation we make in this chapter, The Journal of Pediatrics edito-
rial explained that science backs up the parental reports and case studies that
show that changing your diet makes a difference for many. Don’t let the lack of
evidence stop you. Improving diet and digestion is always a desirable goal.
Tempering Your Expectations
Changing the diet of an autistic person can go a long way to helping the
person cope, but you need to remember that just because a treatment works
for one person doesn’t mean it will help your loved one. Each person with
autism is unique in his symptoms and, hence, his treatment. After trying dif-
ferent dietary approaches, many parents report some benefits to their child’s
digestion and overall functioning. Some report enormous benefits, and other
parents see no benefit at all.
Unless you observe a clear difference in your child after you change his diet,
food sensitivities or diet may not play a role in his autism. But you also need
to realize that some changes may occur immediately, and others take months.
Some of the tips we present in this chapter, such as avoiding refined sugars
and artificial sweeteners, are common-sense behaviors that everyone should
follow. Other actions are more complicated and difficult or may require you
to suspend or ignore conventional wisdom you hold about what’s healthy or
nutritious for your child. For instance, cow’s milk isn’t essential for health in
a dairy-intolerant individual — it interferes with health. You can get your
child the nutrients that come in a glass of milk, such as calcium and vitamin
D, through other sources that don’t wreak havoc with his delicate system.
But no matter the interventions you try, we recommend that you implement
them slowly, one at a time, so that you can identify what exactly has an effect
(see the section “Implementing Your Plan” for more tips on this topic).
Considering Your Dietary 
Intervention Options
When it comes to diets, as I’m sure you can glean from the myriad commer-
cials that cross the television screen, you have options. When it comes to
diets that an autistic person should consider, the options include nutritional
supplementation, eliminating foods that may be causing digestive problems,
and trying special diets. Parents have tried many of these options in conjunc-
tion with behavioral and other interventions (see Chapter 9), and you won’t
130
Part II: Addressing Physical Needs 

be alone if you try them. However, you should consult a doctor or qualified
nutritionist for most of them.
Don’t put all your faith in a radical approach, especially one that comes from
the Internet, where pseudoscience constantly masquerades as news. A sound
approach should be supported by more than one source. Be especially wary
of companies that require you to use only their products or take only their
advice. People will take advantage of a parent who appears desperate for
help, and many parents of autistic children have spent thousands on “miracle
cures” that were miraculous only in their ability to enrich their marketers.
Cleaning up your child’s diet
It isn’t uncommon to hear the parents of an autistic child say the only things
that their child will eat are French fries, pizza, potato chips, and chicken
nuggets! If your child begins to desire only junk food, warning sirens should
start ringing — this isn’t a healthy diet! Any food(s) that a person solely eats
or eats in excess isn’t healthy.
A good way to clean up your child’s diet is to reduce junk food intake.
Eliminating refined sugars and other processed foods can help improve his
general well-being. Whether your child is autistic or not, he needs to eat
healthily. And if he is autistic, eating healthy food is even more important
because his immune and digestive systems need all the help they can get to
function properly.
You must make sure that your child’s school fully cooperates, as well as any
caregivers, friends, and relatives. Many schools are becoming more nutrition-
conscious, particularly with the rising obesity and diabetes levels in children.
If your child’s school focuses on special-needs children, it should ensure that
your child isn’t the only person on a special diet; the school should be used
to accommodating such diets (see the section “Eating on the road” in this
chapter for more eating tips for the road).
Do your best to involve your child in outdoor activities and sports if he’s capa-
ble. His enjoyment and social interaction will keep the focus away from food.
Eliminating refined sugars and other processed foods
Cleaning up your child’s diet by eliminating refined sugars and other
processed foods may improve his functioning dramatically. Avoid foods and
additives such as
 Commercial baked goods and candy
 Soft drinks and high sugar juices
 Nitrites/nitrates
131
Chapter 8: Optimizing Nutrition

 MSG (monosodium glutamate [also known as hydrolyzed proteins])
 Artificial colorings (such as red or blue dyes)
 Artificial sweeteners (such as saccharin or aspartame)
Concentrate on whole, organically grown foods like fresh fruits and vegeta-
bles that don’t contain sugars and aren’t processed. You want to know what’s
in the food you’re feeding to your child, which is why reading food labels is
important. Deciphering food labels (the listings of the ingredients in descend-
ing order of predominance) can be tricky. Generally, the longer the list, the
more likely it is that you’ll find an ingredient that you don’t want your child
to ingest. And if you can’t pronounce the name of the ingredient, you proba-
bly shouldn’t eat it!
Natural foods are what your child will do best with. Your child’s diet doesn’t
have to be as varied as the typical American diet to be well-balanced. Many
cultures around the world eat mainly the same foods with no adverse effects.
If you serve meat products or eggs, make sure they don’t come from animals
treated with hormones or antibiotics.
Considering food sensitivities
Many foods can trigger immune system reactions in a sensitive person’s system.
Some common food sensitivities for autistic individuals include the following:
 Wheat, whole wheat, oats, barley, corn
 Eggs, chicken, shellfish
 Peanuts
 Cow’s milk, yogurt, ice cream, cheese, chocolate
 Refined sugar, aspartame and saccharine, and caffeine
 Chemical additives such as sulfur dioxide and MSG
 Citrus and nightshade vegetables (tomatoes, eggplant, potatoes)
 Yeast and alcohol
Soy, which people often use to replace other proteins in their diets, may not
be the best choice for your child. Many people who don’t tolerate foods such
as dairy or wheat have intolerances to soy because the protein structure of
soy is very similar to that of milk. If you find that this is the case with your
child, consider potato or rice milk rather than soymilk. And because soy pro-
tein is similar to gluten and casein, some diet proponents recommend remov-
ing it as well. Besides gluten and casein, some parents report that removing
corn or soy led to noticeable improvement in their children.
132
Part II: Addressing Physical Needs 

Watch out for sweeteners as well. Don’t take any chances if your child is
hypersensitive. Stick to natural sweeteners that include maple syrup, honey,
and stevia (a natural alternative to sugar or aspartame).
Going wheat and dairy free
Eliminating wheat and dairy from the diet is one of the first steps you should
take after you get a diagnosis (see Chapter 18 for a list of more steps). Typically,
doctors recommend a gluten-free (wheat, oats, rye and some other grains)
and casein-free (milk and all byproducts of milk) regimen — the GF/CF diet —
for autistic individuals. Why does this diet work? One school of thought says
that gluten and casein are responsible for improperly broken-down dietary
peptides — part of the opioid theory of autism — or that immune system
dysregulation causes an abnormal immune response, whereby the body
reacts to these substances by attacking itself. (See Chapter 3 for theories of
autism related to this.)
“But bread and cheese are staples of the American diet!” We understand your
frustration. To make your job tougher, autistic children can be notoriously
picky eaters. Just remember that your child will feel better after you remove
these products from his diet, so the hassle is well worth it. (See the section
“Easing the transition” later in this chapter for tips.)
133
Chapter 8: Optimizing Nutrition
Allergies versus sensitivities
You may be curious about the difference
between a food sensitivity and a food allergy.
You often hear the two terms used interchange-
ably. Both can cause inflammation in your
system, but food allergies usually provoke
instant antibody reactions in your blood such as
hives, nausea, headaches, or swelling. One
common allergic symptom is eczema (also
known as atopic dermatitis), an itchy red rash
most common in the elbow creases or behind
the knees (less frequently, allergic reactions
may include difficulty breathing and/or anaphy-
lactic shock).
Sensitivities, such as metabolic food disorders
like lactose intolerance, don’t affect the same
part of your immune system and can be slower
to act. Sensitivities can cause dizziness, fatigue,
and headaches, which may not happen right
after you eat the food, making them hard to
detect. Many people have food sensitivities and
don’t know it. Some common symptoms of food
sensitivities are headaches, flushing of the skin,
red ears, red cheeks, hyperactivity/dizziness
and/or fatigue, tantruming, acne, digestive prob-
lems, ear infections (especially if chronic),
insomnia, and mental confusion.

Some autistic patients have reported mild to dramatic improvements in
speech and/or behavior after the removal of gluten and casein. Some have
also reported fewer bouts of diarrhea and loose stools. No large clinical study
exists yet to back up the GF/CF diet — such a study is expensive and difficult
to do — and no foolproof test can determine who will be a responder. However,
for any parent of a child caught in the vicious circle of autism, this is a treat-
ment worth trying.
Beginning the GF/CF diet can seem difficult. Making up your mind to actually
do it can also be difficult. Heck, finding out what products contain gluten and
casein can be difficult (for some help, see the sidebar “Sifting gluten and
casein from everyday foods”). But after you get the hang of it, like any diet,
maintaining it is relatively easy. Just remember: Trying the diet and struggling
through it to end up with a happier, healthier, higher functioning autistic
child sounds much better than living with a poorly functioning child.
Be systematic in your approach, taking the following suggestions to heart:
1. Try removing dairy first.
Doctors often suggest that you remove milk first because the body
clears itself of milk/casein the quickest, and because dairy is the most
problematic as far as the immune systems of autistic children go.
Generally, if improvements occur, you’ll observe them within the first
few days to weeks, but it can be gradual.
2. Try to keep your child dairy free for at least two weeks.
If you’re not sure if your child is drawing any benefit, you can return a
small amount of milk to the diet and see what happens. If the child’s
134
Part II: Addressing Physical Needs 
Sifting gluten and casein from everyday foods
You can find gluten and gluten-like proteins in
wheat and other grains — including oats, rye,
barley, bulgur, durum, kamut, and spelt — and
in foods made from those grains. You can also
find them in food starches, semolina, couscous,
malt, some vinegars, soy sauce, flavorings, arti-
ficial colors, and hydrolyzed vegetable proteins.
Gliadorphin (or gluteomorphin) is a peptide
derived from the wheat protein gluten. Other
related grains such as rye, barley, and oats also
contain the sequence of amino acids found in
gluten.
Casein is a protein present in milk and products
containing milk, such as cheese, butter, yogurt,
ice cream, whey, and even some brands of mar-
garine. Manufacturers also may add it to non-
milk products such as soy cheese, hot dogs,
and tuna fish in the form of caseinate. Caso-
morphin (or caseomorhin) is a peptide derived
from the milk protein casein.
“Hidden” milk and wheat can appear in ingre-
dient lists, such as curds, caseinate, lactose,
lactoglobulin, lactalbumin, bran, spices, or cer-
tain types of vinegar.

behavior deteriorates after you return the milk, you should return the
child to a milk-free diet. If you see a clear worsening of behavior when
you “challenge” your child with a food after at least a six- to eight-week
period of “elimination”, you know that the child is sensitive to that food.
If however, after two months, you “challenge” the child, and observe no
adverse reaction, then the reality is that this child most likely does not
have this food sensitivity.
3. Try removing gluten/wheat.
Give this tactic at least three months and up to six to evaluate; it may take
up to six months on a gluten-free diet for the body to rid itself of all gluten.
A sensitive individual will feel the effects after ingesting even a very small
amount of the protein, so make sure you remove all gluten and casein prod-
ucts from the diet entirely.
135
Chapter 8: Optimizing Nutrition
Trying other specialized diets
Some diets that nutritionists recommend for
food-sensitive individuals have support in
autism circles, although they have less experi-
ence with autism specifically (as opposed to
GF/CF, which is widely practiced) and aren’t dis-
cussed as often. For example, candida is a
common yeast infection, and candida diets
(used to treat candidiasis) eliminate yeast and
sugar intake. An important reason to look at
yeast as a contributor to autistic symptoms is
that yeast is easily and safely treatable. If you
suspect yeast may be a culprit in your child’s
condition, discuss this with your doctor. (The
Journal of Pediatrics reported yeast overgrowth
in the intestinal tract of some autistic children
in May 2005. Consider the following sources for
investigation: The Yeast Connection: A Medical
Breakthrough, by William G. Crook, MD,
[www.yeastconnection.com] and Feast
Without Yeast: 4 Stages to Better Health, by
Bruce Semon, MD, PhD, and Lori Kornblum.)
The Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) — which
removes specific carbohydrates, aptly enough —
is a grain-free, lactose-free, and sucrose-free
dietary regimen. The diet works by severely 
limiting the availability of carbohydrates to
intestinal microbes, which require carbohy-
drates for energy. Researchers at Massachu-
setts General Hospital have found that children
with autism frequently lack the enzymes in their
gut that normally digest sugars, which is why
this diet may particularly help those who con-
tinue to have GI symptoms despite other treat-
ments. An alternative is to try a dietary enzyme
product such as Carb-Digest (which specifically
breaks down the problematic sugars) first
before attempting this diet. Head to www.
scdiet.org for more information.
Feingold’s diet, commonly used among the
AD/HD community, advocates eliminating all
additives and chemicals from your child’s 
diet; the diet may also call for the elimination of
salicylates, which means you take out some
fruits and vegetables and virtually all processed
foods (check out www.feingold.org for
more information). Feingold suggests that syn-
thetic food additives can have serious learning,
behavior, and/or health effects on sensitive
people.

It’s especially important when avoiding foods in the wheat and dairy cate-
gories to make sure your child eats well most of the time and that you supple-
ment the things you take away when you extract gluten and casein from the
diet (see the following section for more).
Supplementing your child’s diet
Dietary supplements promote the healing of the immune system, which is
compromised in many autistic individuals. They can also pick up the slack
when you eliminate parts of your child’s previously unhealthy diet (see the
previous sections). We discuss many of these supplements in detail in
Chapter 7, so you should head there for more on the immune system and
why we recommend certain supplements.
Balancing essential fatty acids
Sometimes called “brain foods,” essential fatty acids appear to be out of bal-
ance in the American diet (try watching some reality television for the evi-
dence). You should have a balance of the fatty acids omega 3 and omega 6 in
your diet; yet, Americans typically eat much more omega 6, leading to an
omega 3 deficiency. See Table 8-1 for symptoms of fatty acid deficiencies
when it comes to omega 3 and omega 6.
Table 8-1
The Symptoms of Omega 3 and Omega 6 Deficiency
Omega 3
Omega 6
Dry skin
Excessive thirst and sweating
Tingling in arms and legs

(From Dr. Tapan Audhya, professor of endocrinology at New York University, who specializes in
nutritional biochemistry. Used with permission.)
After 9 to 11 months of essential-fatty-acid supplementation, Dr. Audhya
(refer to Table 8-1) reports that you may see changes in blood pressure and
heart rate. Digestive and sleep patterns seem to improve after 6 to 9 months
in most cases, and abnormal bowel movements reduce by 80 percent. Social
withdrawal and repetitive movements may also lessen, allowing your autistic
child to interact with others more effectively.
You don’t need a doctor’s supervision to try to remedy a fatty-acid deficiency
because it’s safe to do so on your own, and it’s very common and easy to
136
Part II: Addressing Physical Needs 

remedy. The supplements help boost the immune system and increase over-
all health. Some research shows that cod-liver oil, for example, has a positive
effect in raising attention levels. Some people think cod-liver oil, which has
omega 3 and natural forms of vitamins A and D, tastes bad. Not true! It should
taste like salad oil; if it doesn’t, it’s rancid. You can purchase flavored chew-
able forms of cod-liver oil if you still can’t stand the taste. Cod-liver oil has
omega 3 and natural forms of vitamin A and vitamin D. (See Chapter 7 for
more information on fatty-acid supplementation.)
However, you should avoid very large doses of vitamins A and D because
overdoses can be dangerous. And make sure the fish oils you use are high
quality and that the manufacturer certifies them for low heavy-metal content.
You don’t want to create a metal-toxicity problem when you’re trying to heal!
Also, we don’t recommend that you try to get all the oils from fish because of
the high levels of mercury in many fish supplies.
Adding helpful vitamins and minerals
Autistic people often seem to have nutritional deficiencies, which is probably
why you’re waist-deep in this chapter. Researchers aren’t sure which came
first: the deficiencies or the autism. However, they do know that vitamins and
minerals can help ease the strain of a testy system. In this section, we provide
some supplements you should consider with your nutritionist’s and doctor’s
input. (See Chapter 7 for an expanded version of this material, as well.)
Bernard Rimland, PhD, director of the Autism Research Institute (ARI)
(www.autismwebsite.com/ari/index.htm) and a founder of the movement
Defeat Autism Now! (DAN!), reports that vitamin B-6, given with magnesium,
helps approximately 50 percent of people who try it, according to his studies.
You can find more information on this research and other interventions at the
Web site of ARI, which collects data on parents’ experiences with drugs and
nutritional supplementation. ARI has a database of more than 1,000 children
who, according to Rimland, were “recovered” through biomedical means.
Nearly every study on the effects of large doses of vitamin B-6 shows positive
results with no side effects. You include magnesium, a calming agent, to bal-
ance the B-6 because they work together in the body. You should also include
other B vitamins, such as folic acid, with the magnesium supplementation.
137
Chapter 8: Optimizing Nutrition
Your grandmother was right!
Epsom salt baths, a good source of magnesium
(just ask your grandmother), really do work for
calming some autistic kids. The active ingredi-
ent, magnesium sulfate, relaxes, calms, and
detoxifies the body. Sitting in a warm bath with
about one cup of dissolved Epsom salts for 15 to
20 minutes can calm down a stressed, hyper-
active child.

Other frequently recommended supplements include the following (this isn’t
a comprehensive list; you can find more complete information on these and
other supplements in Chapter 7):
 DMG, or dimethylglycine, is a safe food that helps half of all autistic
adults and children by improving speech and behavioral patterns. DMG
is a naturally occurring substance taken by marathon runners to boost
their immune systems. You can purchase it in health-food stores; the
FDA even considers it a food.
 Pancreatic or digestive enzymes can help with digestive disturbances,
such as constipation or chronic diarrhea, which are often seen with
autism.
 Probiotic (good bacteria) supplementation focuses on leaky gut (see
Chapter 7), which interferes with the absorption of nutrients into the
body, and with abnormal bacteria overgrowth that results in a lack of
“good” bacteria, which autistic people often experience.
 Buffered vitamin C boosts the immune system. We have high concentra-
tions of vitamin C in the brain, and vitamin C helps the immune system.
 Calcium is helpful, especially if you’re avoiding dairy products (see the
section “Going wheat and dairy free”). You can find calcium in green veg-
etables such as spinach and broccoli, in nuts, and in seeds.
Implementing Your Plan
Sometimes food can have obvious bad effects, such as diarrhea or abdominal
pain, but other times it takes some sleuthing and time to figure out what’s
really going on — like when your child’s sleep patterns are off or she seems
inattentive and you don’t know why. So, you need a way to catalogue the food
you give compared to the symptoms you see. This leads to — unfortunately —
more paperwork. Keeping track of what your child eats and how she behaves
for several weeks can tell you a great deal about potential allergies or intoler-
ances. You can share your findings with your doctor and ask him to recom-
mend a dietary intervention that may help your child.
Keeping a food and symptom diary
An effective way to figure out what foods distress your child’s system before
you take your concerns and suggestions to a doctor to begin your plan (see
the next section) is to track what your child eats and how it affects her behav-
ior for at least several weeks. The simplest kind of food and symptom diary
works like this:
1. Take a sheet of paper and divide it into four columns.
138
Part II: Addressing Physical Needs 

2. Label the columns in order from left to right as follows: Date, Time,
Food, and Reaction.
3. Use the diary to chart any physical or behavioral symptoms, such as
tantrums, irritability, drowsiness, stomach pain, sleep pattern, bowel
function, including the approximate time of onset.
The more detail, the better, but don’t be overzealous! At first you’ll want
to mark everything, but the novelty will wear off over time.
Table 8-2 provides an example diary entry you can use as a model.

Keeping a diary, among other things, can help you identify problems that
don’t stem from your child’s autism. Aggression, for example, isn’t part of the
definition of autism, so if you see aggression after your child eats certain
foods, the food is probably the culprit, not autism. Medical problems like
intestinal disorders are treatable, and doctors should treat these symptoms,
not dismiss them as autism-related.
The tricky part is that you may not see any pattern develop immediately.
People tend to eat different foods together, not separately, so you may not be
able to isolate the symptoms readily. If you have some trouble, you can begin
to do some simple testing.
Say, for example, that you suspect eggs are causing your child some digestive
distress. You start by keeping anything that contains eggs or has traces of
eggs (food labels in the United States are required to give this information)
from the child’s diet for at least a week, and then you try giving her a little bit
of the suspected allergen and closely monitoring the results. Now answer
these questions:
 Did being away from the food reduce any of her symptoms?
 Did anything happen when you went back to the allergen that didn’t
happen during the previous week?
 Did your child become particularly withdrawn or particularly aggressive
within hours of eating the food?
139
Chapter 8: Optimizing Nutrition

The answers to these questions tell you which foods to definitely avoid and
which ones to keep an eye on. Retest the questionable items to be sure you
see a connection before removing them entirely. Some of your child’s behav-
iors may be triggered by other sensitivities she may have, such as tempera-
ture, noise, or bright lights.
You can take what you’ve found to your doctor or a nutritional expert (see
the next section) to put your child on a specific diet aimed at improving her
functioning (see the previous sections in this chapter for more on specific
types of dietary interventions).
You can use your diary to track your child’s progress with other interven-
tions, too, so make sure you include which supplements you start and when
you introduced them so you can monitor those as well.
Involving professionals
You take action on your dietary plan by finding an experienced professional
to advise you on how to safely find a healthy diet for your child. Because
dietary intervention isn’t universally accepted, you need to find a doctor or
nutritionist who’s open to working with you, or else you’ll get little support in
your efforts. Some interventions, such as the GF/CF regime and essential fatty
acid supplementation, are so safe you can do them on your own without risk.
However, a qualified nutritionist can help enormously — especially one who
has experience with food sensitivities.
Why specifically do you get your doctor or nutritionist involved? We don’t
consider it optional for most of the interventions we discuss here, and here’s
why: You need to ensure that you aren’t depriving your child of essential
nutrients when you alter his diet. Although he may be eating only pizza now,
you don’t want to cause or worsen any nutritional deficiencies.
Show your food diary (see the previous section) to your doctor or nutrition-
ist and ask what dietary interventions he recommends.
Your doctor should continue to monitor your child’s health during any nutri-
tional intervention so he can recommend any necessary supplements to sup-
port the nutrients that may be temporarily lacking in the daily diet. Your
doctor or nutritionist also should perform appropriate tests. Tests are
needed to monitor your child if he’s taking very high doses of a certain sup-
plement, for instance.
You can’t find an absolutely reliable test to determine who will be a respon-
der to any kind of diet. However, lab testing may help you decide whether to
140
Part II: Addressing Physical Needs 

consider trying a GF/CF diet or help convince other family members that it’s
worth a try. The following list mentions tests you may want to ask your
healthcare professional about:
 The IgG food allergy test can provide clues regarding food intolerances.
Most standard labs (like LabCorp or Quest) perform this test with a lab-
oratory screening of a sample of blood drawn from the patient. Most
insurance companies cover this testing.
 An IgE food allergy test, which also features a laboratory screening of a
sample of blood, looks for Immunoglobulin E, a type of protein that’s
produced against a specific food — a food-specific antibody that circu-
lates in the blood stream. The person must experience an exposure to
the type of food before the body produces this type of response. Another
way to test is by prick testing the skin to foods.
In the beginning of an intervention, we don’t recommend telling others —
teachers, relatives, friends, therapists — about any specific dietary interven-
tions you’re trying. That way, if anyone reports any changes in your child, no
preconceived thoughts or feelings about the intervention influence what the
others say. However, if you think that outsiders will compromise your efforts
by giving your child foods you want to eliminate, you must consider inform-
ing them.
If your child is taking any medications during the dietary intervention, don’t
stop giving the meds without talking to your doctor. If you see improvements
as a result of the supplements, you may want to taper off the medication to
see what happens, but not without your doctor’s supervision.
Easing the transition
It can be tough to change your eating habits, and even tougher to change
somebody else’s. This is especially true in the case of autistic children, who
may refuse to try new foods in favor of sticking to foods they like.
Accepting change is easier when it’s gradual and accompanied by pleasant
substitutes. You should try to replace offending foods with new foods the
child likes instead of eliminating entire categories that may be staples of the
child’s diet. Look for ways to make your child’s favorite foods familiar with-
out including offending ingredients. For example, you can make pizza without
wheat flour, topped with casein-free cheese (see the section “Going wheat
and dairy free”). You can also help your child discover new favorite foods.
Experiment with new dishes and ethnic cuisines (under your doctor’s permis-
sion, of course; see the previous section).
141
Chapter 8: Optimizing Nutrition

Be aware that food manufacturers are known to change their ingredients
without warning. Some of their foods may still be included on Web lists, or
ingredients may just change without you knowing it. We can’t stress the
importance of reading labels on all your food purchases enough! Also,
beware of sugar-free claims on packaged foods. These foods may be high in
other types of sugar, such as alcohol sugars, or they may contain artificial
sweeteners. Read the labels carefully and don’t buy anything that advertises
a sweetener as the first or second ingredient listed.
It may be hard to create substitutes for the foods your child loved in the past,
but be patient and persistent. The good news is that many people have stepped
in to make it easier for the harried and overwhelmed parent. You can find
cookbooks, Web sites, mail-order catalogs, and entire lines of products for
special diets. As awareness of food allergies and intolerances continues to
rise, companies that produce gluten-free bread, pasta, and dairy-free foods
are proliferating.
Special Diets for Special Kids, by Lisa Lewis (Future Horizons), is a great
resource for autistic kids. A mother of autistic children herself, Lewis
explains both how and why to implement a dietary intervention strategy for
children and adults with autism. Also, the Autism Network for Dietary
Intervention, www.autismndi.com, founded by Lisa Lewis and Karyn
Seroussi, is very helpful.
Natural foods stores, such as Trader Joe’s, and Whole Foods stores are good
places to find whole, unprocessed foods and organic fruits and vegetables.
Some online and mail order companies include the following:
 Miss Roben’s: www.missroben.com — 800-891-0083
 Kinnikinnick Foods: www.kinnikinnick.com — 877-503-4466
 Ener-G Foods: www.ener-g.com — 800-331-5222
Other Web sites, such as www.gfcfdiet.com, list foods that are gluten-free
and casein-free and are commercially available at most standard groceries.
Experimenting with specialized diets
For children who have multiple food sensitivities, it may seem like everything
they eat causes a reaction. For such a child, an allergy elimination diet may be
the best course of action. In this diet, you start from scratch by providing
bland foods, such as brown rice and steamed green vegetables, which sensi-
tive individuals can tolerate. These foods stabilize your child’s digestion.
After you stick to this for a few days — with vitamin and mineral supplemen-
tation, of course (see the section “Supplementing your child’s diet”) — you
142
Part II: Addressing Physical Needs 

start reintroducing other types of foods one at a time and watching what hap-
pens. For instance, the first week you may make eggs, the second week you
add nuts and legumes, the third week brings meats and poultry, and so on.
(As with all diets, you need a doctor or clinical nutritionist to help you imple-
ment this diet safely; see the section “Involving professionals”.)
A rotation diet is another option that may be worth a try. With this diet, your
child eats some foods for only a few days and then stops; these foods rotate
in and out of the diet. This process helps your child handle foods that he’s
sensitive to by decreasing exposure to them.
If you do reintroduce a culprit food, and you see a reaction, it can take sev-
eral days for the body to remove it again. And regardless of the interventions
you try, you should implement them slowly, one at a time, so that you can try
to identify what exactly has a positive or negative effect.
Eating the same or similar foods repeatedly aggravates people with food sen-
sitivity. For instance, when you eat a wheat-based cereal with milk in the
morning, pizza for lunch, and fettuccine alfredo for dinner, you’re eating the
same basic foods — dairy and wheat, just in different forms.
Eating on the road
Eating away from home on a special diet can be tricky, but times are chang-
ing. Even fast-food outlets are responding to parents’ complaints about gluten
in the fries (restaurants sometimes use small amounts of wheat flour when
frying).
When traveling, you should bring along as much food as you can so that your
child won’t go hungry if you can’t find appropriate meals. The good news is
that many restaurants are becoming more proactive and knowledgeable
about dietary restrictions, and many servers are happy to assist with your
special requests. Some menus even have sections designated gluten-free or
dairy-free. Bring the child’s food with you to restaurants if you aren’t sure
that you’ll find something acceptable. If your waiter or manager asks or com-
ments on the food, explain that your child has food sensitivities; the staff
should be happy to accommodate you. Don’t be shy!
When your child is old enough, she can do her own screening, but for now,
speak to all people who may be providing food to ensure that they adhere to
whatever plan you’re following. Send acceptable snacks to teachers to have
on hand, and offer to make replacement foods for school/birthday parties.
Initially, you may not want to explain the specifics of what you’re doing, but
you may want to ask outsiders not to give your child any foods without your
permission. That way, you can control what she eats away from home.

A
lthough children with autism may have intelligence to spare, they often
have trouble communicating. Meaningful, spontaneous communication
doesn’t occur naturally, as it does with neurotypical children. Most young
children learn by imitating, watching, and interacting with others, but in the
autistic brain, these abilities don’t develop on schedule.
A child who has difficulty processing and responding to verbal requests —
such as “What’s your name?” — is unable to take part in social and academic
settings without some help. Behavioral, developmental, and educational
training can be a form of this help.
But one size absolutely does not fit all when it comes to autistic and develop-
mentally disabled children. Some generalizations are true, however, such as
the following: Early behavioral, developmental, and educational intervention
gives autistic individuals a good chance of making strong progress toward
obtaining the skills needed for academic and social success before they enter
the school arena.
In this chapter, we explain how the more well-known training approaches
work, what to look for in a good home-based or school program, how to
decide which intervention is best for your child’s needs, and — combined

with the information in Chapters 4, 6, and 11 — how to evaluate therapists
and teachers.
We explore other types of medical interventions in Part II of this book, as well
as nonmedical interventions in Chapters 10 and 11 that can work in conjunc-
tion with the therapies we mention in this chapter. You should continuously
evaluate and monitor your child to determine if the programs you implement
are helping, or else why bother having them? If your child doesn’t respond to
a technically perfect, high-priced intervention backed by the best theories,
you have a Rolls Royce with no wheels — expensive and impressive, perhaps,
but useless for getting anywhere.
Understanding What to Look for in 
the Alphabet Soup of Approaches
The fruit of past research in autism includes myriad interventions,
approaches, and techniques for working with children on the autism spec-
trum. Many parents and other caregivers that support people with autism
often wonder which approaches and techniques are the best.
Unfortunately, deciding on the proper course of treatment can be difficult.
The difficulty of choosing a methodology is compounded by the lack of 
evidence-based research across the different approaches. On one hand,
plenty of research points to the significant health benefits of exercise — as
emphasized by the Daily Life Therapy methodology we describe later in this
chapter. However, evidence-based research for individual methods — much
less comparing the approaches — remains lacking as a whole, possibly due
to the difficulty in managing the many variables such as teacher competence,
home life, hours spent in an intervention, medical issues, and so on.
Reframing the question “What’s the best methodology?” to “Which methodol-
ogy is best for this person at this time?” is a much more helpful approach.
The most important thing to your child’s improvement is that you choose a
program that’s individually tailored for your child’s needs. But first, with the
help of a knowledgeable professional, you must select a basic approach, or
perhaps a combination of approaches. How do you choose a basic approach
when 1) no single approach has consistently performed better than the
others, and 2) some children benefit more from one approach than another?
The key is to determine the approach that best fits the child’s needs at the
current time. Becoming familiar with the promising approaches we outline in
this chapter will help you determine the best fit according to the child’s chal-
lenges, personality, and family needs.

Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

Actions and behaviors that lead to 
success in all interventions
Educational research on autism is exploding, and experts and families alike
can now say many things with confidence about what works and what doesn’t.
Research has shown the following actions and behaviors to be aspects of a
successful program for autistic children:
 At least 25 hours a week of systematic, planned, data-based instruction that
actively focuses on engaging the child’s mind, not just keeping him busy
 Teaching that stresses functional, meaningful, and spontaneous behaviors,
such as asking for a glass of water, rather than isolated skills that don’t
have a purpose in real-life communication, such as touching one’s nose
 Setting the kind of goals appropriate for any child, such as developing
independence and social responsibility, which too much emphasis on a
discrete-trials approach may lack
Discrete-trials involve breaking down tasks into tiny components, which
the child learns separately. This method can be helpful in teaching par-
ticular skills rather than in teaching social interaction.
 Predictability and routine on a daily basis, within a dynamic framework
that evolves as the child progresses
 Ongoing assessment of outcomes
 Tools for students and teachers to communicate with each other
You often see problem behaviors, such as head banging and pinching, in
the brightest kids because they feel frustrated with being unable to com-
municate. You can eliminate problem behaviors by helping a child com-
municate simple messages, such as “I’m confused and need a break,”
even if the child needs to communicate by sign language or on a key-
board (see Chapter 10).
 Generalization of skills across multiple environments
Does the child understand the dangers of touching a hot stove in other
houses, not just his or her own, for example?
Keys to success in educational 
interventions
In a school setting, look for the following keys to a successful treatment 
program:
149
Chapter 9: Choosing an Appropriate Intervention

 Small teacher-to-child ratios
 Time spent in the presence of non-autistic peers so kids can see appro-
priate behavior modeled
Intensive instruction with other disabled children is necessary, but too
much time spent with others who have similar disabilities can be limiting.
Some children may need to be in a separate environment for a period of
time before being included in a regular education plan. For these situa-
tions, teachers must have a plan for gradual and meaningful inclusion of
the children.
 Plans for a transition from the preschool classroom to grammar school.
It’s also important to plan for transitions to middle school and high school
at the appropriate times. Older kids living with autism must also plan for
life after K-12, which involves employment, appropriate interdependent
living, community interaction, and relationships (see Chapters 14 and 15).
 Social instruction delivered throughout the day — for example, teaching
proper interaction with peers, such as taking turns, and appropriate
communication as well as learning to take another’s perspective.
Research shows that individuals with autism tend to lack a function called
the Theory of Mind, which aids you in imagining situations from other per-
spectives. In one study by Uta Frith, a professor of cognitive development in
London, children were shown a box containing an object that was removed
after another researcher left the room. When the researcher came back, the
children made the assumption that the researcher knew the box was now
empty, although the person couldn’t have known this. The children couldn’t
grasp that the other person’s experience had been different from their own.
The Theory of Mind, which develops in non-autistic children at about age 3
or 4, makes dealing with other people much easier, and not having this ability
causes difficulty for many autistic individuals. However, when groups of
people with autism gather together at autism conferences, they seem to
understand each other well. Perhaps what we are really looking at are chal-
lenges of autistic people understanding the non-autistic mind — and people
not on the autism spectrum comprehending autistic thought patterns.
Exploring Popular Intervention
Approaches
In this section, we explore some popular methods for teaching children on
the autism spectrum vital skills such as communication, social interaction,
academics, and appropriate behavior; these skills enable them to lead fulfill-
ing and productive lives to the best of their potential. Specifically, we highlight
seven approaches here: first, five methodologies/interventions/therapies
(including Applied Behavioral Analysis, Daily Life Therapy, Developmental
150
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

Individual Difference Relation-Based Intervention, Miller Method, and
Relationship Development Intervention) and then two philosophies (including
Treatment and Education of Autistic and Communication Handicapped Children
and Social Communication Emotional Regulation Transactional Support Model)
that you can use to combine certain methods according to the needs of the child.
We hope that you find one or more of them suitable to you and your child’s
needs and outlook on life. Looking at the salient components of these
methodologies, we attempt to outline where you can find each approach,
who applies each method, and some of the unique contributions of each par-
ticular approach as you consider a program for your child.
The bad news? The cost of these approaches is dear. Many run from $30,000
to around $100,000 a year for implementation. Here’s the question you must
ask yourself and your family: How much more dear is the cost of not applying
an intervention that your child needs — an intervention that may mean the
difference between lifetime custodial care and living an interdependent, ful-
filling, and productive life (see Part IV for more on these topics).
We realize that reality tends to rear its ugly head. It isn’t easy for most people
to come up with such resources. For some advice, see the end of this chapter
and Chapters 16 and 18 for ideas on best utilizing the scarce dollars that you
have to devote to caring for people with autism.
Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA)
Applied Behavioral Analysis, or ABA, is a way of teaching and reinforcing
appropriate behaviors. Psychologist Ivar Lovaas of the Lovaas Institute for
Early Intervention at UCLA developed this technique. Professionals often use
ABA techniques as a basis for designing behavioral interventions for autistic
individuals.
Lovaas developed his applied behavior modification techniques to teach chil-
dren to respond to requests and to communicate, and his methods have
become one of the standards for the behavioral treatment of autism.
You can find Applied Behavioral Analysis in many public and private schools,
where kids work with special-education teachers and some special-education
school aides, and practiced by some private therapists who specialize in
working with children on the autism spectrum. Note: ABA providers should
be board certified.
Make sure that the practitioner employing the Applied Behavioral Analysis
method takes into account the cognitive-developmental level of the child, as
well as any possible neurological challenges, such as sub-clinical seizures,
that may affect the child’s behavior. (In contrast to drop and petit mal seizures,
subclinical seizures show no outward manifestation, save for possible peri-
ods of “spacing out”.)
151
Chapter 9: Choosing an Appropriate Intervention

Understanding how ABA works
Currently, the ABA method places more emphasis on engaging the child on
his own terms, learning in natural settings, and using the child’s own curios-
ity about a subject in which to build a lesson. In short, the ABA approach
strives to be more like how children learn naturally and less like a classroom
exercise or skills training.
The focus is on engaging the child continually and discouraging him from wan-
dering off to activities such as repetitive play or self-stimulation (also known
as stimming; see Chapter 10). ABA isn’t meant to be unpleasant for the child;
you should provide plenty of breaks, rewards, and opportunities for play.
Getting to the root of behavior
The concept of analyzing Antecedence, Behavior, Consequence may be one of
the most valuable contributions of ABA. Analyzing the source of a behavior
and what may be causing it is useful no matter what methodology or approach
you use. The challenge of figuring out the meaning of behavior starts with exam-
ining possible antecedents. For example, suppose your child has a tantrum when
you turn on the television. You want to analyze what causes this behavior.
Maybe your child experiences sensory overload from the high pitch of the
picture tube (that most people can’t even hear), or maybe he perceives the
screen-flicker rate the way most people see a strobe light. A rare possibility is
that your child is seeking attention.
Consequence refers to the conditions maintaining the behavior. By acting out,
your child motivates you to turn off the TV. With some experimentation, such
as using an LCD screen rather than a picture tube to eliminate the possible
sensory overload, you can work toward finding a solution to the challenging
behavior. (You can find out more about analyzing behavior by using a
Functional Behavioral Assessment in Chapter 11.)
Breaking actions into little steps
You may also hear the term discrete trial when exploring the ABA approach.
The discrete trial approach was the original type of ABA. Using the idea of “task
analysis,” you break down a skill or routine into minute parts, and you teach
each part separately and chained together as an entire procedure. Discrete
trial training takes place in a one-on-one teaching situation and emphasizes
rote skill building through very systematic and consistent approach by the
practitioner. For instance, a child could spend hours practicing tying her shoes
or buttering a piece of bread after breaking down the task into its separate
components. Here are some example steps for the bread-buttering process:
1. Open the cabinet.
2. Remove a small plate and put it on the counter.
152
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

3. Open the breadbox.
4. Remove a piece of bread and place it on the plate.
5. Open the refrigerator.
6. Take out the butter and place it on the counter.
7. Take the top off the butter dish and place it on the counter.
8. Open the silverware drawer.
9. Pick up a butter knife and hold it in your dominant hand.
10. Use the butter knife to slice off a small chunk of butter.
11. Hold the bread on the plate by the edges with your nondominant hand.
12. With the butter facing downward, wipe the knife across the surface of
the bread, using long strokes and pressing lightly.
13. Take another small chunk of butter (see Step 10) if needed.
14. Continue Steps 10 through 12 until you cover the surface of the bread
with butter.
If the child does the task correctly, you reward her. You don’t reinforce incor-
rect responses; you weed them out systematically by repetitive trials. Some
children may be able to combine steps, and others may need one or more
individual steps broken down further. Here’s to hoping that the butter isn’t
too cold and spreads easily!
Forming ABA conclusions
Does the ABA approach work? Lovaas’ 1987 landmark study showed that 40
hours a week leads to a significant increase in functioning. However, critics
point out that he performed the study on a small number of selected high-
functioning autistic children and not on a random sample.
Many have taken Lovaas’ conclusions to mean that less than 40 hours weekly
is useless, which isn’t necessarily true. Research shows that children who
receive targeted, intensive therapy — no matter which intervention — can be
helped with as little as 25 hours a week.
Also, the type of structured routine provided by behavioral programs works
well for many people with autism. Just as some neurotypical people, many
people with autism don’t react well to frequent changes and need help deal-
ing with new situations. Some people on the autism spectrum need more
structure than others, and ABA may be one way to achieve that.

Chapter 9: Choosing an Appropriate Intervention

Introducing the new kid on the block: Applied Verbal Behavior (AVB)
Applied Verbal Behavior (AVB) is an approach to ABA that stresses language
development. AVB programs, based on behavioral psychologist B.F. Skinner’s
theories about the origin of verbal behavior, have become popular over the
last decade. Skinner broke language down into the following categories:
 Requests
 Imitation
 Expressive labels
 Following instructions
 Responding to verbal behaviors
AVB teaches children to imitate, follow instruction, match, and what Skinner
called manding — making requests by using vocalizations, signs, or a Picture
Exchange Communication System (PECS). (See Chapter 10 for more on PECS.)
The rationale behind AVB is that language is supposed to be the foundation
for many other skills; therefore, when you teach language first, you make
other skills easier to acquire.
AVB differs from traditional ABA practices in that it’s less formal and struc-
tured, and the process occurs more in the natural environment. Also, the
approach tries to minimize errors through systematic prompting and fading.
The approach has fewer studies available than discrete trial training, but the
principles it’s based on are similar.

Daily Life Therapy (DLT)
The late Dr. Kiyo Kitahara of Tokyo developed Daily Life Therapy (DLT) in the
1960s. Originally a kindergarten teacher, Dr. Kitahara began forming her prin-
ciples of DLT from working with one of her children who was on the autism
spectrum. In addition to vigorous exercise and a fine-arts program, Daily Life
Therapy mirrors Japanese philosophy by placing a heavy emphasis on group
interaction rather than the intensive one-on-one teaching you find in other
interventions. Instruction takes place in a classroom with a number of other
children; practitioners provide supports to enable the autistic child to bene-
fit from group-oriented teaching.
Although DLT is primarily a day school, residential options exist for a limited
number of children, where the tenets of DLT are generalized to their living sit-
uations. Children ages 3 to 13 are accepted and may stay until they “age out”
at 21 if needed. As of press time, there are no certified DLT practitioners, and
the approach is available only in Tokyo, Japan, and in Boston, Massachusetts.
However, schools in South Korea, Uruguay, and the United Kingdom are
developing DLT programs with support from the Musashino (Japan) and
Boston Higashi Schools.
Understanding how DLT works
Some experts, including the late Dr. Kitahara, feel that children learn more
when exposed to the interaction of other students. Therefore, DLT empha-
sizes group dynamics rather than the individual instruction concentrated on
in other approaches. DLT also focuses on physical education and emotional
regulation through art, music, and academics — topics that form the core of
the program. The program also emphasizes the acquisition and development
of communication and daily living skills.
Physical conditioning
Practitioners of DLT believe regular and rigorous exercise builds a foundation
for good health. Children attending the Higashi Schools (in Tokyo or Boston;
see the section “Getting more information about DLT”) start the day jogging
or learning to ride a unicycle, walking on stilts, doing jumping jacks, and 
performing other gymnastics demonstrated regularly at school festivals.
Educators at both the Boston and Tokyo schools find that regular exercise
helps reduce excess stimming and aggressive behaviors, promotes better
sleep habits, and paves the way to emotional stability and academic success.
Plus, with the endorphins that regular exercise releases, the students (and
the faculty as a result) feel much better. Figure 9-1 shows students competing
in a road race, which they’ve been training for on a daily basis through jog-
ging and other physical activities.
155
Chapter 9: Choosing an Appropriate Intervention

Emotional regulation
Mastery of self-care skills is believed to help with the development of self-
esteem and contributes to emotional stability, which is vital to getting along
with others and yourself. Higashi’s programs in the fine arts and music take
over where physical education leaves off. Each child learns how to play the
recorder — not only for the musical aspects, but also for practicing vital
skills in communication and working with others. Cooperating with others for
a common goal is exemplified by the Higashi Schools’ stunning Jazz Band,
which regularly performs both on and off the Boston school campus. In addi-
tion to music, DLT’s extensive art program enables the students’ work to
appear on book covers and other venues.
Academics
Education is the primary reason why most students attend school. Like with
the other aspects of daily life at DLT schools, teachers educate in a group
format. However, the schools provide plenty of support to students on the
autism spectrum with a high teacher-to-student ratio. As much as possible,
instructors at the schools strive to teach their students as close to grade
level as possible.
Getting more information about DLT
Dr. Kitahara provided a three-volume set to fully describe the DLT program:

In Japan, the Musashino Higashi Gakuen is an elite private school for regular-
education students. What’s interesting is that in addition to the school being
in high demand by parents of regular-education students, about one-third of
the population (of around 600) is made up of children on the autism spec-
trum. With the autistic students included as much as possible, it’s almost
impossible for a casual observer to differentiate between the children with
autism and those without. Here’s the contact info for the school:

Developmental Individual Difference
Relation-Based Intervention (DIR)
Practitioners of Developmental Individual Difference Relation-Based
Intervention (DIR), developed by Stanley Greenspan and Serena Wieder,
approach autism from a developmental point of view rather than as a behav-
ioral issue. DIR is a less-structured model for behavioral intervention, focus-
ing on strengthening and then building upon the emotional bond of the child
with his or her caregiver. This method is often referred to as Floortime; how-
ever, the Floortime component is only part of the approach.
In a departure from the DSM descriptors of autism (see Chapter 2),
Greenspan and Wieder recognize that children with autism tend to have bio-
logical challenges interfering with the processing of sensory input, and that
they have difficulties with motor planning and sequencing tasks.
Understanding how DIR works
Like with TEACCH and SCERTS (discussed later in this chapter), DIR is cen-
tered on using existing therapies as well as developing new approaches to
encourage children to pass through six hierarchal functional-developmental
milestones. One of the unique contributions of DIR is that practitioners take
into account the individuality of each child when bringing him or her into the
world of human relatedness. Additionally, you place an emphasis on working
with the entire family as opposed to just the child.
157
Chapter 9: Choosing an Appropriate Intervention

In their book The Child With Special Needs (Perseus Books), Greenspan and
Wieder identify their six developmental milestones a child with autism needs
to master in order to develop the necessary skills in communication, think-
ing, and coping with the world on an emotional level. Due to the developmen-
tal nature of the stages, a child must master each milestone before
attempting to reach the next level.
The following list presents the six milestones that a qualified DIR practitioner
helps guide a child through:
1. Self-regulation and interest in the world. Success in the first stage means
the child can use his five outer senses of sight, touch, taste, smell, and
hearing, as well as the two inner senses — the vestibular (for balance) and
proprioception (for awareness of the body) — to gather information from
the environment. At the same time, the child learns self-regulation,
enabling successful interaction with the environment. The child begins
to form threads of connectedness with the objects and people around
him. (You can discover more about the senses in Chapter 10.)
A child who hasn’t mastered this stage becomes overwhelmed with sen-
sory input, resulting in irritable behavior such as a whining or a tantrum.
Other children may take little interest in their environment and seem
detached. Most interaction with your child at this point should be
sensory-motor related, such as swinging, tickling, and bouncing. You
need to be aware of the child’s regulatory state so you don’t over-
stimulate him.
You can find more information on how to interact with your child and 
on carrying out the following stages at the Web site home.sprintmail.
com/~janettevance/floor_time.htm#ToSixDevelopmental
Milestones.
2. Intimacy. A child at the second stage seeks interaction with her peers
and others in a warm, joyful, and loving manner. The child takes the thin
Stage-1 threads for relating to objects and people and parlays them into
enjoyment and pleasure. If the child doesn’t reach this stage, she inter-
prets her environment as a confusing, scary, and painful place, which
often results in a desire to seek the company of adults, who generally
have more patience than the child’s peers.
3. Two-way communication. At the third stage, a child understands the
impact of her interactions with others, which results in greater security
when relating to people. The child displays two-way communication
with gestures to both initiate interaction and to respond to communica-
tion from others. The child can now weave the threads of interaction
with the environment into yarn for a stronger connectedness with her
environment.
A child who doesn’t reach this level can be hard to engage, may seem
oblivious, and may seem content to observe from the sidelines, as if she
wants to get involved but doesn’t know how. The child faces difficulties
158
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

in reading nonverbal and pragmatic information and requires outside
help to facilitate interaction and take initiative.
Practitioners of DIR refer to the initiation of communication as opening,
and responding to another person’s communication as closing, a circle
of communication.
4. Complex communication. After the child masters the basics of commu-
nication, she can now string a series of gestures together in order to
convey wishes and intentions, and she can read these gestures in others
as well. The threads of connectedness, which she has now woven into
yarn, become stronger as the child realizes the power of her commu-
nicative attempts.
Issues of sensory integration may be the causes for failure to work
through this stage. Not reaching this stage results in a child who
becomes overwhelmed when the complexity of two-way communication
increases.
5. Emotional ideas. A child who masters the fifth stage can engage in rep-
resentational play. For example, she may use a toy car for pretend races,
travel, accidents, and repairs instead of turning it upside-down to spin
the wheels. A girl may feed her baby doll and tell her “night night” when
it’s time to sleep. The child also begins to narrate these activities. Her
words now have meaning; they don’t just symbolize objects, events,
people, and ideas. The child can use words to explain thoughts and feel-
ings and to create stories about particular objects, such as the car or
the doll.
A child who can’t master this level may still show an interest in toys and
keep calm, but she’ll communicate only when motivated by a need. For
example, the child may spend most of her time spinning the wheels of
her toy car rather than using it as an object to drive to a location.
6. Emotional thinking. A child who masters this stage can connect patches
of emotional expression and separate representative pretend-play events
to form a quilt of emotional connectedness. For example, instead of play-
ing with toy cars and dolls as separate events, the child connects the
two activities. After the doll goes to sleep, mommy and daddy doll may
put her into the car for a drive to the ice cream store or to play at a
friend’s house. The child develops a greater understanding of self and
how her actions affect another person, and vice versa. The child can
interact on higher levels of emotion as her verbal and spatial skills
increase. For example, the child can now say, “I’m happy that you gave
me cookies and milk.”
A child who can’t master this stage remains unable to link the emotional
patches to form a complete quilt. Although it may seem like the child
has mastered the previous emotional milestones, at times the achieve-
ments fall apart under stress, and the child can’t close circles of 
communication.
159
Chapter 9: Choosing an Appropriate Intervention

As both the DIR and ABA approaches (see the section “Applied Behavioral
Analysis [ABA]”) continue to evolve, some autism experts note that DIR is
complementary with ABA, as they both borrow what works from one another.
The discrete trial training component of ABA is often preferred for a child
who lacks basic cognitive and interactive skills. However, critics of ABA con-
tend that it focuses so much on rote learning that it limits children; they per-
form tasks without gaining understanding of what they’re doing. Defenders of
ABA say that as ABA continues to evolve, many of the criticisms no longer
apply. For example, actions such as spraying water or vinegar on a child to
discourage a behavior are no longer practiced.
Getting more information about DIR
Dr. Greenspan and Dr. Wieder still practice DIR; however, the needs of autistic
children are so great that additional certified practitioners are required. You can

Miller Method
Arnold Miller spearheads the Miller Method from the Language and Cognitive
Development Center (LCDC) in Massachusetts. The Miller Method aims to
close gaps in how a child perceives and thinks about the world and in the
child’s developmental progress by using a systems concept — in other words,
using the desire to complete units of behavior as a jumping off point for
learning new things. The vehicle for the learning is elevation on specially
built structures about 21⁄2 feet above the ground.
The developmental aspect of the Miller Method considers children with
autism spectrum disorders as completely or partially stuck at earlier stages 
of development; therefore, the approach structures its interventions to spur
on development. The cognitive aspect of the Miller Method promotes cogni-
tive development by structuring the environment to be conducive to increased
160
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

cognitive development. The emphasis on thought processes contrasts with
other, more behaviorally oriented approaches, which devote most of their
focus to stimuli and responses.
The Miller Method is based at the LCDC, located in Massachusetts. You can
also find certified practitioners throughout the United States and Canada (see
the section “Getting more information about the Miller Method”). Unique to
the Miller Method is its Video Conferencing Oversight (VCO), where Arnold
Miller and other senior staff members supervise sessions via cameras, televi-
sion monitors, and ISDN lines or the Internet.
Understanding how the Miller Method works
Defined by Arnold Miller, founder of the Miller Method, as an organized unit
of behavior around an object, person, or event, the system concept serves as
the engine behind the power of the Miller Method. A system is a coherent
organization (functional or nonfunctional) of behavior involving an object,
event, or person. Systems may be quite small, such as opening and closing
doors, or quite elaborate, such as sorting videos on the shelf in alphabetical
order. The hallmark of a successfully formed system is a desire evident in the
child to continue the activity after an interruption occurs.
The concept of the system plays a role in restoring normal development in
the Miller Method in two ways:
 Building on the repetitive behaviors (systems) the children manage to
achieve, such as lining up blocks.
 Teaching children certain behaviors that they haven’t been able to spon-
taneously develop by introducing repetitive activities, such as teaching
a child how to pour water from a cup.
Practitioners of the Miller Method use the power of an interrupted system to
teach functional communication and general expansion of a child’s aware-
ness of the world around him. If you’ve ever left off the last word of a song,
such as “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star,” in anticipation of a child’s response to
end the song, you’ve disrupted the system of a musical phrase hoping that
the child will fill in the last word.
For typical development to occur, practitioners of the Miller Method believe
that the child must pass through the five stages indicated in the following
list. The child experiences the first four stages prior to “repertoire” at the
pre-executive functioning level. In other words, the child is driven to act by
events in his or her environment without cognition:
1. The first phase is orienting, where the child makes initial contact with
a stimulus within her surroundings.
For instance, orienting in an infant can take place as she looks toward a
rattle that an adult is shaking nearby.
161
Chapter 9: Choosing an Appropriate Intervention

2. After orienting, the child engages with the stimulus by interacting
with it.
With the rattle example, engagement occurs as soon as the child reaches
toward the rattle and makes contact with it. Arnold Miller believes that
orienting and engagement are prerequisites for forming a system.
3. A system forms when the child begins to act on the stimulus or 
develops another repetitive, predictable, organized unit of behavior
around it.
The child forms a system when she begins to shake the rattle after
touching it or develops another repetitive, predictable behavior.
The child “owns” the system if both of the following two actions occur:
• The behavior continues on its own.
• The child makes a compensatory attempt to continue the behavior
after the rattle is removed by shaking her hand as if she’s still hold-
ing the rattle. You see compensatory actions if, for example, a song
is played and the performer stops on the penultimate note.
Audience members often react to complete this interrupted song
(system) by singing the last note.
Referred to as a system disruption, removal of the rattle often elicits a
functional communicative attempt to continue the shaking behavior,
which commonly leads to a tantrum. However, before that tantrum
occurs, there should be an attempt at functional communication, such
as a vocalization geared to retrieving the rattle or perhaps sign language.
When functional communication occurs, the practitioner should imme-
diately return the rattle to the child. Should the session dissolve into a
tantrum, the practitioners should return the rattle or make another
attempt to reduce or eliminate the tantrum. The concept of employing
system disruption is a central concept of the Miller Method.
4. A ritual forms when salient sensory input from an aspect of the
system activates the entire behavior.
For example, just the sight, touch, or sound of the rattle causes the child to
shake her hand as if she’s actually holding the toy. If you put other toys in
the room, the child will still be compelled to interact only with the rattle.
At this point, salient stimuli from the environment externally drive
behaviors. The child who can form a system is dominated by that
system; she lacks the ability to choose whether to engage in the system.
5. The final phase, where practitioners of the Miller Method strive to
bring all children, is repertoire. At this stage of development, the
child has the element of choice.
The child can choose to interact with the rattle or some other toy. Post-
executive function develops gradually over time from when the drive to
engage with salient stimuli arises from external events to this engage-
ment driven by internal events, or choice.
162
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

Elevated structures are employed in the Miller Method with the idea of rais-
ing a child’s awareness of the world around him. Just as you pay more atten-
tion to where your feet are if they’re on a raised plank, children with autism
can focus better when placed on elevated objects. The concepts imple-
mented when working with the elevated structure are then generalized to 
the ground. (You can find plans for building elevated structures at www.
cognitivedesigns.com.)
In addition to promoting enhanced focus, the raised structure limits the ten-
dency of children on the autism spectrum to “spin off” into space. Finally, the
structure improves what Arnold Miller refers to as “architecture”, meaning
that the child’s face is now at about the same level as the faces of adults.
One of the most unique forms of the raised structures is the elevated square
(see Figure 9-2). This device consists of four 18-inch-wide planks set 21⁄2 feet
above the ground on four large wooden boxes, and is painted in yellow with
blue trim. Each of the four corners has stations where the child can work on
concepts such as “open”, “close”, “pick-up”, “give”, and so on.
Multiple practitioners should be present to assure that the student doesn’t
fall off.

Relationship Development 
Intervention (RDI)
Beginning in 1996, Steven Gutstein and Rachel Sheely constructed the treatment
Relationship Development Intervention (RDI), based on concepts developed
from prior autism interventions such as Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA), the
Miller Method (MM), and Developmental Individual Difference Relation-Based
Intervention (DIR). Similar to the latter two methods, practitioners of RDI focus
on remediating the delays and differences in cognition, emotion, communica-
tion, and social interaction that cause difficulties for autistic people.
Success with the RDI method requires heavy family involvement. Parents and
other family members must help guide the child or relative toward more flexi-
bility and thoughtfulness by presenting novel and increasingly unpredictable
settings to challenge the child’s growth. In addition to family members, the
child’s therapist, school staff, and other supporters must make a commit-
ment to the child with autism for the method to achieve success.
Understanding how RDI works
Relationship Development Intervention emphasizes enabling people with
autism to have a high quality of life. Practitioners achieve this goal by devel-
oping dynamic intelligence in their children that most people who don’t
reside on the spectrum seem to have. Practitioners attempt to create fun and
enjoyable learning sessions for everyone involved to make the transition to
dynamic intelligence easier for all affected participants.
Those of us who engage in spontaneous conversations and tell jokes may
take dynamic intelligence for granted. Dynamic intelligence also creates the
emotional connectedness of sharing a knowing glance, collaborating with
others, drawing satisfaction with close friends and significant others, and
living an appropriately interdependent life.
164
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

The six areas of emotional intelligence
Practitioners of RDI strive to teach children with autism how to join in on the
pleasures of life by developing six areas of emotional intelligence, as indi-
cated on the RDI Web site (www.rdiconnect.com):
 Emotional referencing allows a person to understand how another person
is feeling through verbal, nonverbal, and other communication pathways.
For example, you can share the joy another person experiences or per-
ceive a teacher’s disapproving look before someone throws a spitball.
 Social coordination is what people use to match or complement others’
emotions. For example, you may express sadness for a friend as he
describes a lost opportunity or consciously put on a happy face to con-
vince him that “it’s not so bad after all”. Social coordination also
includes the ability to repair a breakdown or misunderstanding in com-
munication.
 Declarative language allows you to make statements about the world by
using words or nonverbal communication. This skill allows the person
with autism to express and invite curiosity, participate in interactions,
share perceptions and feelings, and coordinate actions with others. For
example, you may say, “The sun is bright today!” or “You can do it.”
 Flexible thinking, also known as cognitive shifting, enables you to go
with the changing flow of events, even when they’re unpredictable. You
may say, “Although the 2 o’clock math class was cancelled due to a
school assembly, I will remain calm and ask my teacher the math ques-
tions I have during lunchtime.”
 Relational information processing means being able to adjust the
volume of your voice to the environment. For example, a loud indoor
voice is different from a loud outdoor voice. You employ relational infor-
mation processing skill as you co-regulate your walking speed to match
165
Chapter 9: Choosing an Appropriate Intervention
A stop-and-go experiment in co-regulation
Try the following experiment with a friend or
coworker: As you walk down the hall or street,
vary your pace while keeping up a conversation
of your choice. Most likely, your friend will
match your walking speed on a subconscious
level. If you ask her if she noticed anything
about your walking style, she may realize that
you kept changing your speed. But, you had to
bring the thought into her conscious mind with
your question.
If your friend kept pace with your walking, she
successfully co-regulated her behavior with
you. Although we take co-regulation for granted
as something that occurs naturally in most
people, persons on the autism spectrum may
lack this important social-interaction skill.
However, people with autism can acquire the
skill of co-regulation; this is one area that RDI
focuses on.

another person’s speed. In this case, no single correct pace exists; the
speed is based on external factors.
 Foresight and hindsight refers to a form of prediction and evaluation.
For example, you may be able to predict the outcome of being polite and
saying “Thank you”. Hindsight enables a person to recall a time when a
parent or friend got upset when she failed to give thanks for extra efforts.
The eight guiding principles of RDI
Educating children with autism on the six areas of competence (mentioned in
the previous section) form an underpinning allowing an RDI practitioner to
concentrate on eight guiding principals for enabling children with autism to
more successfully interact with people and their environment.
An elementary woodshop teacher of mine used to frequently say, “The faster
you go, the further behind you get.” The same holds true with RDI. You need
to take the amount of time necessary to achieve success, because you must
give children time to properly master the earlier skills that serve as a founda-
tion for later development.
1. Building a strong foundation.
Practitioners develop systematic and measurable outcomes for the
child’s program. A sample outcome may be to have the child become
flexible in choosing amongst a number of toys to play with.
2. Developing a user-friendly environment.
Modifications and pacing are based on careful evaluation of a child’s
capability. In that way, a child has a safe environment in which to
explore new ways of interacting. In other words, the pace of going
through activities is often slowed at points where the child has to make
a choice and when different choices are encouraged.
3. Implementing guided participation through a “master” and “appren-
ticeship” relationship.
Usually fulfilled by the parents as they work side-by-side with the child
to explore and develop new ways of understanding the child’s environ-
ment. Sometimes, you may want another person who’s significant in the
child’s life to serve as a “master.” Initially, the master leads as the child
takes on specific roles. As the child develops more ability to co-regulate,
the master begins to serve more as a reference point for handling new
and confusing situations. The final goal of this principle is for the child
to become a “junior partner”, engaging alongside the master as equals.
4. Improving personal episodic memory.
People with autism often have very good procedural memories. Examples
of procedural memory include arithmetic and factual descriptions of
events. Episodic memory, on the other hand, engages the emotional
166
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

aspects of interaction. By “freezing” the action at key points, you create a
figurative spotlight that illuminates important emotional experiences. You
then find ways to preserve that memory through regular review. Telling
stories, with props as needed, as well as daily reflection are encouraged.
5. Building motivation for dynamic systems.
You can motivate children by using the principle of episodic memory so
they can remember the emotional content of activities. Children will
then want to experience these emotions again, which serves as a power-
ful motivator to repeat the activities.
6. Changing communication.
RDI practitioners encourage children with autism to use much more
declarative rather than imperative statements. Declarative statements,
such as “We’re driving faster,” “Oh oh,” and “We can do it” focus on emo-
tional states rather than questions or demands to modify an activity.
Examples of imperative statements include “Put that toy away,” “Look at
me,” or “Say please.” Within the RDI model, declarative statements are
used to predict, reflect, and regulate interaction and to demonstrate
curiosity.
7. Creating opportunities for practice.
Incidental learning makes teachable moments out of ordinary and
unplanned events. For example, instead of just giving up your seat to a
person in need on public transportation, you may explain why you’re
doing so.
RDI practitioners take the concept of incidental learning one step fur-
ther. They assist parents in adapting their schedules to increase the
number of incidental learning events. For example, an activity as simple
as walking around the block may be loaded with additional opportuni-
ties for practice. You can walk like cartoon characters, suddenly stop
and start, pretend to walk on the moon, or pretend that a walking part-
ner is blind and needs assistance from the child.
8. Progressive generalization.
A child’s successes in earlier systems form the foundation for engaging
in more complex activities later. At this point, different people and set-
tings should be employed. Before you may have removed potential 
distractions, but now you purposely introduce them into the child’s
environment with the goal of developing skills for focusing on what’s
important.
For example, you may introduce the child to situations where communi-
cation frameworks break down and are impossible to repair. You may
introduce increasing amounts of distraction and disorder from a televi-
sion in another room, or you may “suddenly” run out of milk and have to
determine what to do to correct the situation.
167
Chapter 9: Choosing an Appropriate Intervention

Throughout the RDI process, children are encouraged to engage in 
experience-sharing interactions; you don’t restrict them to instrumental
social interaction. Instrumental social interaction relies on rote scripts and is
conducted to obtain a specific endpoint. In other words, people serve as
“instruments,” or the means to an end in order to obtain something we want
(like information, money, food, or any other commodity). One such example
is ordering a hamburger from a cashier.
Your challenge is to lead the child toward experience-sharing interactions,
where people are related to as ends unto themselves in order to create
common experiences. Experience-sharing interactions introduce novelty and
variety into our lives. An example of such an experience is two friends decid-
ing to take a walk in the woods for the sheer beauty of seeing the trees.
Getting more information about RDI
RDI is available from certified consultants throughout the United States,
Canada, and Australia. Certified consultants have to participate in a rigorous
training program and require recertification every 12 months. (You can find
specific information on finding these consultants at the RDI Web site,
www.rdiconnect.com.)
The amount of RDI a family involves is scaleable to its needs and other fac-
tors. By gleaning information from RDI Program books, DVDs, the program’s
two-day introductory workshop, and other sources, you can implement por-
tions of the RDI Program as time and finances allow. Families who want to go
“whole hog” can initiate the process of obtaining the RDI intervention with a

Treatment and Education of Autistic 
and Communication Handicapped 
Children (TEACCH)
The TEACCH development began in the early 1970s as a reaction against the
prevailing thought that autism is an emotional disorder. Centered at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, TEACCH focuses on tailoring indi-
vidualized programs, building on existing skills and interests, and respecting
“the culture of autism.” By emphasizing building on strengths more than
remediating weaknesses, practitioners of TEACCH address a common criti-
cism of many treatment programs.
Along with the SCERTS model (Social Communication, Emotional Regulation,
and Transactional Support), TEACCH is more of a philosophy rather than an
intervention — a philosophy based on assessing children with autism for
their needs and using already existing approaches for helping people with
autism lead fulfilling and productive lives.
Understanding how TEACCH works
Not quite a “method” in the strictest sense, TEACCH is actually a public
health program of services for autistic people. Initially, the program was
available only in North Carolina, but now you can find it in selected locations
around the world. Because TEACCH is more of a philosophy of treatment
rather than a specific method, practitioners of TEACCH make use of several
techniques and methods — such as the highly structured learning environment
of Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) and the person-centered approach of the
Developmental Individual Difference, Relation-Based model (DIR) — in various
combinations depending upon the individual’s needs and emerging capabilities.
TEACCH practitioners emphasize understanding the characteristics of people
with autism as a basis for arranging their environments to maximize success.
You won’t find any certified TEACCH therapists or consultants, per se. Although
the TEACCH program offers a number of conferences, seminars, and workshops
for learning the approach, no formal program prepares people as “official” or
“certified” TEACCH practitioners at this time. However, educators from around
the world attend the TEACCH-held training sessions and use the material to
instruct children with autism — sometimes in a TEACCH-oriented classroom.
One primary example of the efforts of TEACCH practitioners to work with,
rather than against, autism is in their structured-teaching approach. Grounded
on understanding how people with autism think and function, the structured-
teaching approach involves careful organization of the environment and pre-
dictable ordering of tasks and events. According to The TEACCH Approach to
Autism Spectrum Disorders, by Gary B. Mesibov, Victoria Shea, and Eric Shopler
169
Chapter 9: Choosing an Appropriate Intervention

(Springer), practitioners employ the following elements to assure that the 
structured-teaching approach works with the characteristics of people on the
autism spectrum:
 Organization of physical environment: TEACCH practitioners believe
that children on the autistic spectrum don’t always understand where
they’re supposed to be, and practitioners believe that clear physical
boundaries can help.
Whether at school, home, the workplace, or in the community, bound-
aries are made wherever activities take place. The boundaries are made
clear through placement of furniture and through visual cues, such as
words for students who can read and pictorial reminders for kids who
can’t. For example, a young child may need areas delineated for play,
schoolwork, eating, and the bathroom. An older child may have areas
for work, leisure time, and practicing housekeeping skills.
 Predictable sequence of events: Predictability is important for reducing
anxiety and helping people with autism become successful.
You can increase predictability for autistic (and other) people by imple-
menting a daily schedule or a preplanned series of steps for activities
such as work projects, therapy sessions, chores, and recreation. Students
in a TEACCH setting have both a regular class schedule and an individ-
ual schedule for personal activities, which is very much like a “to-do” 
list used by many people.
 Routines with flexibility: Routines can help make sense of a confusing
world by creating a sense of order and predictability. Prescribing
healthy routines also helps prevent people with autism from developing
nonfunctional routines, such as having to smell all the computers in a
computer lab prior to starting work.
For a person with autism to be prepared for a world of continual
changes, however, you have to build flexibility into the routines. For
example, you can keep the routine structure for eating dinner essentially
the same, but you can add in some variations in the food, the plates you
use, your eating utensils, your placement at the table, and so on.
 Visual schedules: People with autism tend to be visually based rather
than language-based. Therefore, providing a picture or written schedule
for reference reduces the possibility of a person forgetting what you
have previously communicated orally. A visual schedule can also help
with getting through transitions such as getting on the bus to start the
school day, moving from one location to another, and even getting ready
for bed. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, visual schedules foster
independence from adult support later in life, in addition to promoting
feelings of security and competence.
170
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

Visual schedules can be text-based for persons able to read or picture-
based for persons who haven’t yet developed reading skills. You can 
use objects, such as a computer mouse to represent computer time, as
symbols when creating the schedule. TEACCH practitioners stress the
importance of making sure that each day’s schedule varies from the pre-
vious day to some extent in order to keep kids from getting too attached
to a routine (which is all too easy to do!).
 Visually structured activities: People with autism tend to have consider-
able visual strength combined with a need for concrete representation of
tasks or activities. As a result, you can engage interest in a person with
autism more successfully if you give him something to see, hold, or
touch. Practitioners of TEACCH strive to make sure that they provide
the following to a person with autism in a visual manner:
• Instruction: One method of visual instruction includes providing a
sample of the completed task, such as a pamphlet already folded
into thirds with a stamp on it in preparation for mailing. You may
also provide written instructions, as well as the use of a jig or sil-
houette to indicate exactly where the person should place an
object — a plate silhouette for setting a table, for instance.
• Organization: Many people with autism become overwhelmed
when materials are in disarray. Perhaps you have some objects
covering others so they can’t be seen; you should organize these
materials before the person begins working with them.
• Clarity: Providing too many materials for a task can confuse people
on the autistic spectrum. However, you can make an army of mate-
rials seem like a small militia if you categorize the components
required for a task by using different shapes, colors, and textures
to accentuate the differences. For example, if you provide two dif-
ferent pamphlets to prepare for mailing, you could use two con-
trasting colors such as blue and yellow to help differentiate
between pamphlets.
 Work/activity systems: Work/activity systems provide a meaningful way
for people with autism to approach tasks and situations, and they indi-
cate the passage of time between the middle and end of an activity. In
short, these systems approach the organization of a task with the follow-
ing four elements in mind:
• What? Practitioners should describe the task or tasks. For some,
the task may be as simple as folding a piece of paper into thirds.
For others, that single task may be one of the many tasks involved
in stuffing, stamping, and placing envelopes into a bin for mailing.
• How much? In a word, quantity. How many pieces of paper will the
child fold, or how many envelopes will he prepare for mailing?
171
Chapter 9: Choosing an Appropriate Intervention

• What progress have I made, and when am I finished? Measuring
progress is usually done visually. A practitioner can use a timer
clearly showing the passage of time for time-oriented tasks. For
folding pieces of paper or preparing envelopes, the increasing
number of finished products or the decreasing amount of work left
can serve as a visual status cue.
You can signify a finished task with a ringing bell or a timer at its
end. A job is finished when all the work is done.
• What happens next? For the envelope-stuffing task, a practitioner
can signify completion with a graphic on the table under the
envelopes indicating the next step. Examples of “next steps”
include going to see the teacher or going to the shelf in the room
to restock the table. These instructions can also be a part of a pic-
torially based schedule board for persons who are nonverbal.
As with schedules, you can represent work/activity systems in a way the
person can understand — be it with pictures, words, or objects that
symbolize the events.

Social Communication Emotional
Regulation Transactional 
Support Model (SCERTS)
The Social Communication, Emotional Regulation, and Transactional Support
Model (SCERTS) is a collaborative work between Barry Prizant, Amy Wetherby,
Emily Rubin, Amy Laurent, and Patrick Rydell. Similar to the TEACCH method
(which we review earlier in this chapter), one of the key characteristics of
this model is to use whatever approaches exist to best match the child’s
needs, making it more of a philosophy than an intervention.
Realizing that no one approach fits all children on the autism spectrum, the
collaborators, who are experts in the field of autism, strove to develop a
model that would start by assessing the needs of children with autism. And
rather than reinvent the wheel, they would make use of existing interven-
tions, based on the assessments made.
Unlike some of the other approaches we outline in this chapter, SCERTS pro-
vides no certified practitioners. The developers of SCERTS offer this model in
the form of an easy-to-read manual that provides structure and guidance for
educators, therapists, family members, and others who support the needs of
people on the autism spectrum.
The child is seen as an active participant in his learning rather than a bucket
you need to fill with knowledge and skills in a rote manner. The SCERTS
approach also places a heavy emphasis on the coordination of all persons
involved to support the child with autism.
Understanding how SCERTS works
The SCERTS model is based on the following three components:
 Social communication
 Emotional regulation
 Transactional supports
According to the recently released book The SCERTS Model: A Comprehensive
Educational Approach for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (Brookes),
authored by the collaborators of the SCERTS approach, practitioners of
SCERTS realize that most childhood growth and development takes place
within a social environment of everyday routines and experiences rather
than in isolation. The manual further indicates the importance of properly
educating parents, caretakers, and others who help the child with autism.
173
Chapter 9: Choosing an Appropriate Intervention

Doing so enables them to assist the child with developing skills in communica-
tion and in regulating his emotional states in the social world. These skills are
vital for achieving greater success through school, home, and in the community.
Practitioners of the SCERTS model begin with assessing a child’s ability in 
the areas of social communication, emotional regulation, and transactional
supports. Practitioners then employ, with frequent reassessment to accom-
modate changes in the child’s needs, the approaches and therapies best
matching the child’s needs.
Social communication
Placing a heavy emphasis on communicative ability, the developers of SCERTS
believe that a person’s level of social communicative competence directly
affects his or her success in relationships and satisfaction with the commu-
nity he or she lives in, whether or not the person is on the autism spectrum.
Therefore, teaching a child with autism skills in communication is considered
a vital part of any program. Practitioners address two major areas of func-
tioning as they construct a SCERTS program:
 Joint attention: Refers to the idea of sharing a reference point with another
person. An example of joint attention is being able to follow where a part-
ner is pointing or following a gaze to an object or another person.
Practitioners may teach joint attention by using exaggerated facial and
verbal responses to an unexpected or an anticipated event. You can teach
following a point by pointing, turning your head, and gazing toward toys
or other objects the child likes that are (in the beginning) partially hidden
from view. Ideally, these objects should be close by and needed to accom-
plish a certain task. After the child is able to follow this nonverbal commu-
nication, you can try reducing the point and then the head turn, leaving
only the eyes to indicate the direction of the object(s).
 Symbol use: Refers to how a person communicates. Some children who
are more severely affected with autism may be at a pre-symbolic stage,
using gestures or objects to communicate. For example, a child at the
pre-symbolic stage may lift her arms if she wants Daddy to pick her up.
The symbolic stage is signified by the use of signs, picture symbols such
the Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS; see Chapter 10),
and/or functional verbal communication. Ideally, a child will be able to
switch communication modalities as needed so that when Daddy can’t
hear her request to be picked up because he’s wearing headphones, she
can revert to pointing at a PECS picture or even make the pre-symbolic
gesture of lifting her arms.
Facility in both joint attention and symbol use results in a child successfully
getting her needs met and reduces her reliance on unacceptable or challeng-
ing behaviors as a mode of communication.
174
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

Because SCERTS is a philosophy rather than an intervention, developing
skills in the various aspects of SCERTS will be taught in different ways for
each child. For example, one child may learn symbol use better through an
Applied Behavioral Analysis–type discrete trial training approach, using PECS
graphics. Yet another child may be better off using the Symbol Accentuation
program developed as part of the Miller Method.
Emotional regulation
We all learn better when we’re free of distracting thoughts and interferences
from the environment, such as a jackhammer pounding down the street.
However, most people can ignore this extraneous input from the environ-
ment. People with autism find it much harder to regulate internal emotional
states or to ignore stimuli from the environment. The emphasis SCERTS
places on emotional regulation is very helpful for people on the autism spec-
trum in allowing them to properly attend to the environment.
Emotional regulation focuses on finding and maintaining an optimum level of
emotional arousal. This frees a child (or an adult) to be available for learning
and having satisfactory interactions with the environment in general. The
SCERTS program teaches kids how to seek and respond to support from
adults in the following three areas of regulation:
 Mutual regulation: When experiencing an undue amount of stress, over-
stimulation, or an emotionally destabilizing situation, a child with autism
will be taught how to request or accept assistance from another person
to help regain composure using whatever communication system works
for her. For example, if a child with autism starts feeling overstimulated
from a noisy birthday party, she will ask her mother to take her home.
 Self-regulation: Self-regulation refers to educating the child how to
remain at an optimal level of arousal when confronted with a potentially
stressful situation. For example, a person with autism may carry
earplugs to the movies in preparation if the audio is too loud, or the
person may be taught to point to an, “I am okay” graphic after falling
down as a sort of reassuring self-talk.
 Recovery from extreme dysregulation: Recovery may be the hardest
regulation to achieve because it involves what to do after a person with
autism gets so overstimulated that he either has a tantrum or shuts
down. A person will be taught how to pull himself out of a state of
extreme dysregulation such as knowing to seek out the quiet of a prayer
chapel in an airport when over stimulated by crowds and noise.
Transactional supports
The previous two Social Communication and Emotional Regulation components
of SCERTS provide coping skills for the autistic child — useful for interaction
with others and maintaining an optimal level of arousal. However, the third
175
Chapter 9: Choosing an Appropriate Intervention

component of SCERTS, transactional supports, serves as a sort of glue that
binds the first two parts together by instructing parents, teachers, therapists,
and even other children how to best scaffold their support of those with
autism. People can provide transactional support in four main areas:
 Interpersonally, or between people
 In both formal educational and incidental manners in all areas of life
 To families for seamless generalization between education, community,
and home
 To professionals and other service providers

Deciding Which Method 
Is Best for Your Child
The process of selecting the best intervention method for your child is error-
less learning — there is no one right answer. Your main concern should be
choosing the approach that seems to be the best fit.
Which of the approaches we outline in this chapter “speaks” to you and
makes you want to investigate further? We hope many of them! For the best
effect, the entire family should take part in the intervention process. Some
lifestyles may fit better with a more prescriptive, rule-bound approach, such
as one modeled on Applied Behavioral Analysis. Another family may be
better off focusing on developmental levels and interactions based on the
child’s interests, through interventions such as the Miller Method or RDI.
Now that you’re fortified with the basics of the most well-known approaches
for helping persons on the autism spectrum, you can begin to narrow down
your selection.
Word of mouth from other parents can be very helpful. Just remember that
the suggestions of others are based upon how well their therapists and
chosen approaches worked for the people with autism they support. The
176
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

needs of those people may be different from the needs of your child. The
choice is between you, the person with autism that you care for, and others —
such as family members, therapists, friends, and often your school system —
who may be supporting this person. (Some school systems dictate what
method or methods are used and some have more flexibility. You always have
the option of exploring other schooling options if the public school in your
community doesn’t offer what you need; see Chapters 11 and 12.)
Financing the At-Home 
Program of Your Choice
Any at-home program you choose for your child is going to be costly. After
all, you’re hiring a person or group to work with your child, and you’ll likely
be legally required to provide health insurance and other benefits if the
person or group works more than a certain number of hours per week.
Before you give up on at-home programs because of cost, consider your
options. Many parents with an average or below-average income have found
ways to fund their child’s treatment by believing that the long-term benefit of
having such a program outweighs the short-term financial stress. The choice to
proceed is a judgment call, however, that only you can make for your family.
Exploring your at-home options
You have many options at your disposal — options that have worked for
other families. They range from major life changes to small shortcuts. Here
are some possibilities:
 Turn to relatives for cash, get extra jobs, or downsize to a smaller home.
Don’t be shy about borrowing money if that’s what it takes. Consider the
sacrifices you willingly make for your child’s future. You can negotiate
services such as medical care in some cases.
 Organize a charitable effort, such as a golf tournament, with all the pro-
ceeds going to fund a program.
 Train college students to work with your autistic child (shortages of thera-
pists in some places make it difficult to find qualified people). Talk to other
parents or ask around at your local support group for references. Note that
many government financial sources expect that the parent or caregiver will
be providing a majority of interventions and care. These sources view the
service providers (professionals) as trainers for the family.
 Move to a state or county within your state that has more services for
disabled students.
177
Chapter 9: Choosing an Appropriate Intervention

We’ve even heard of families temporarily living apart in order to get serv-
ices while maintaining employment for a spouse.
 Petition your school system to expand its services, and go to court if
necessary.
A growing number of attorneys specialize in special-needs law and are
willing to take on such cases.
We don’t recommend that you try to do the intervention yourself, at least for
more than a few hours a week, because you already have enough on your
plate. In some cases, health insurance covers at-home treatments. Autism is,
after all, a medical problem. Be sure to check with your insurance provider.
Some insurers may try to avoid paying autism claims, so many healthcare
providers are becoming more targeted in their prescriptions. In place of
autism, they may list a more specific diagnosis, such as a gastrointestinal 
disorder, when submitting claims. The moral is: Know your policy.
Obtaining government assistance
For the entire United States, the federal Medicaid program administers the
EPSDT, or Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, Treatment program, for chil-
dren enrolled in Medicaid. Children up to age 21 can receive preventive
healthcare services (the government considers behavioral programs to be
preventive care in many cases).
The EPSDT program requires states to cover services that are medically nec-
essary to improve or prevent a condition. It also requires states to actively
arrange the treatments, through referrals or direct contact. The list of med-
ically necessary services includes the following:
 Diagnostic evaluation and intervention
 Inpatient and outpatient hospital services and rural health clinic services
 Laboratory and X-ray services
 Home healthcare services
 Physical therapy and related services
 Community-supported living services
 Case management services
 Other medical services prescribed by a doctor or by another licensed
healthcare provider
178
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

Medicaid is usually means-tested for minors, which means that you can’t par-
ticipate if your family’s assets are above a certain amount. Recognizing that
this limitation causes many middle-class families to slip through the cracks,
the federal government created what’s known as the Katie Beckett waiver (or
Medicaid waiver). Some families qualify for substantial financial support —
even funding for a full-time program — by using this waiver, which makes
exceptions for incomes that exceed normal Medicaid guidelines.
The Medicaid waiver, in which the state picks up half the cost of the treat-
ment and the federal government picks up the rest, isn’t available in every
state, however. Within the broader federal guidelines, different states have
various Medicaid programs and rules. You can find the law in your state from
a local disability advocacy organization, or you can try the following govern-
ment Web site: www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicaidStWaivProgDemoPGI. Don’t
overlook the economic impact of government benefits when choosing where
to live or choosing a future guardian for your child. (For more on guardian-
ship, see Chapter 16.)
In the states in which the Medicaid waiver does exist, there may be a waiting
list of many years, so sign up as quickly as you can to get on the waiting list.

Chapter 9: Choosing an Appropriate Intervention
Do-it-yourself Medicaid
What can you do if you’re unhappy with the lack
of flexibility and service provided by your state’s
Medicaid agency? Consider this: Some parents
in Maryland and Tennessee have gone so far as
to allow people they know to act as Medicaid
service providers. In some states, friends and
family members (other than parents or spouses)
of a disabled person are legally permitted to join
forces and become part of a microboard — a
self-directed support organization for one indi-
vidual. People often organize a board when the
person is very disabled and requires a great
deal of care — sometimes 24-hour supervision.
If the person’s needs change, the provider can
change services without going through waiting
lists or over other hurdles. The microboard puts
the complete focus on the person’s needs and
desires. Everyone in the disabled person’s life
will appreciate the personal, focused attention
and resources that a group of caring and con-
cerned individuals can provide.

C
lose your eyes and imagine what a cat looks like. Do you envision a
generic feline with two ears, four paws, and a tail? Most people do, but
Temple Grandin, the best-selling author of Thinking in Pictures (Vintage) and
a person living with autism, can’t imagine a generic image of a cat, or of any
other animal for that matter. She can remember what a cat looks like only by
flipping through an imagery slideshow in her head of cats she’s seen before.
Learning sequential, nonvisual information is also challenging for Grandin
and for others like her. Algebra is one concept she could never grasp, for
instance, because she can’t form pictures of what’s happening; she can
understand geometry, on the other hand.
Although all autistic individuals may not see the world in exacting photo-
graphic detail, most autistic individuals experience the world differently.
Their senses don’t process information in the same way, so they experience
seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and touching in a unique manner. In this
chapter, we explain the unusual ways that people with autism experience
their worlds, give you ways to handle their unique behavior, and introduce
some interventions that can help them in educational and social settings so
they can communicate and process sensory information. An intervention is a
system, therapy, or tool that serves to help people with autism overcome
challenges that exist with the condition. Here are the three basic categories
of intervention we discuss in this chapter:
 Communicative and social interaction systems: Tools designed to aid
people with autism in communicating their needs in ways non-spectrum
people can understand.

 Sensory integration aids: Interventions tailored to help the brain orga-
nize the information it receives from the senses.
 Neurotherapy: A therapy designed to retrain the brain so it can calm
down and maximize the benefits from and/or lessen its dependence on
medications.
Not all the ideas in this chapter apply to every person with autism. Autism is a
wide spectrum that includes people with mild to severe symptoms, and those
symptoms vary. Thus, we continually stress individualized attention to your
situation. We can’t give you a one-size-fits-all formula that works for everybody.
Autistic Learning: Transferring 
Skills and Providing Structure
All children can learn, but each child learns in a different way. Understanding
the unique way that your child learns and using that knowledge to your
advantage can make the difference between frustrating failure and success.
And with the latter comes continued motivation in learning. The brain —
especially a young child’s brain — is open to change, continually building
new connections based on stimulation from one’s environment. The autistic
brain is no different in this respect. The newly formed connections occur
across the autism spectrum, from the least to the most affected individuals.
Not all autistic individuals think in pictures, but many have trouble 
generalizing — something that comes naturally to a typical brain. When you
generalize, you formulate general principles from particulars. When ques-
tioned about something he likes, a person with autism may list all the types
of animals he knows instead of making a general statement, such as “I like
animals.” The autistic mind focuses on concrete, specific examples, not on
the big picture. People with autism can exemplify the proverbial “losing the
forest for the trees.”
In the following pages, you find out how to help an autistic child take hold of
the big picture, focusing on concepts and ideas, and you see how a struc-
tured routine can make a world of difference for the child’s ability to learn.
Thinking conceptually and 
transferring concepts
You can help most autistic children think conceptually by guiding them to
put details together to form ideas — preferably with visual symbols. You can
demonstrate abstract concepts like “more” or “less” with objects instead of
182
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

explaining them in words. To teach a child fractions, for example, you can use a
piece of paper or a piece of fruit that you can cut up to show quarters, thirds,
and halves. And to teach the word “fraction,” you show the word with the pic-
torial example so that the child can form an association between the two.
Check out the animal example we present in the introduction to this section.
Say that you want to teach an autistic child the categories of dogs. Whenever
you go for a ride or a walk, point out the different types of dogs when you see
them. Identify the dog as a dog and mention what kind of dog it is (Bulldog,
Dalmatian, and so on). State what makes it a dog and not a cat or a bird.
Picture books that show many kinds of dogs may be helpful.
A person with autism functions best with literal, concrete terms, not
abstractly. Explaining a concept with detailed descriptions isn’t as effective
as showing a picture or the object itself. “A picture is worth a thousand
words” is quite true for a person with autism. And to complicate matters, an
autistic person will take idiomatic expressions like the previous quote so lit-
erally that he may ask, “What are the thousand words?”
Severely autistic children (or children with classic autism; see Chapter 2)
may need to use touch as their most reliable learning method. You can walk a
child with severe autistic symptoms through a new task by taking his hand
and prompting him to touch the objects involved, because he may not under-
stand the shape by sight if his visual processing is impaired.
A child with autism may also have trouble transferring a freshly learned skill,
such as tying his shoelaces, to a new task if you alter the situation at all. For
example, if you give him another pair of shoes that have, say, brightly colored
laces made of a different material, he may not be able to use the skills he
recently learned to tie them. Although the two situations may seem identical
to you, the autistic child doesn’t realize that the laces are still shoelaces and
that he can tie them in the same way, because they look different than the ones
he’s used to. You should also maintain touch consistency when teaching tasks
such as lacing shoes to a severely autistic child. If you introduce new touches,
you must take time to acclimate the severely autistic child to the change.
When introducing an autistic child to a new situation, even if only one or two
details have changed, you must take care to familiarize him with new aspects
that may cause confusion. If he’s going to a new school, for instance, you can
help by taking him there before the first day to do a walkthrough, where you
explain what will happen and show him where different items are located and
how to use them. Perhaps you can even arrange for him to meet his new
teachers.
And always remember to be understanding and compassionate. The normal
anxieties a child faces in a new situation, like the first day of school, are
increased by his difficulties in transferring behaviors to new settings — 
settings that seem conceptually similar but appear to him to be different.
183
Chapter 10: Dealing with Learning and Sensory Differences

Incorporating routine into daily life
One of the hardest things to understand about an autism spectrum disorder
is the great importance many people with autism place on structure and rou-
tine. Susie shrieks if she can’t watch her favorite video all the way through
each time, even though she’s seen it countless times. Bobby insists on lining
up his cars and trucks in order of size, and if another child “messes up” his
order, he can’t relax until he returns each toy to its place. Will has to put on
his shoes after his socks, and if his parents can’t locate the shoes he likes
best immediately, he asks for them repeatedly, sounding like a broken record,
and won’t put on anything else or stop asking until he gets them.
Dealing with the symptoms of autism isn’t easy, and dealing with others’ neg-
ative reactions just adds to the struggle. A person with autism may be bat-
tling feelings of chaos and anxiety. His world may be a confusing jumble of
unrelated events, loud and painful sounds, or overly bright lights, like being
in a funhouse where the entire environment is distorted.
In such a situation, the person feels the need to impose an order on the world
just to survive and have a feeling of security. Not understanding or process-
ing information from his senses and brain the way that others do, the person
creates his own security. Nobody wants the feeling of security ripped away —
particularly if you don’t know why it’s happening. You may not understand
such behavior (and you don’t have to), but you can help by maintaining rou-
tines and helping the child deal with new and unfamiliar routines.
Advocates for autism believe that non-autistic people have caused much
damage by arbitrarily imposing their judgments about what’s logical and
acceptable behavior on people with autism. For the person with autism, his
behavior serves a need and seems right and logical to him — what he’s doing
isn’t irrational. For this reason, when you implement an intervention (found
in later sections of this chapter), you analyze the child’s behavior from a
functional standpoint. To redirect a person’s behavior, you must first under-
stand the motivation for the behavior and what rewards the person gleans
from it. You must assume that the behavior makes sense to the autistic
person, even if it doesn’t to you.
Writer and artist Donna Williams, a person living with autism, points out that
it’s important to know the difference between an autistic person’s involun-
tary responses and behaviors, and actions that are authentic reflections of
who the person is. You want to help the person get past the former; you want
to encourage the latter. Automatic behaviors may vary across the autism
spectrum. High-functioning individuals may exhibit an intense need to orga-
nize or learn intricate detail about everyday items, whereas low-functioning
individuals may be resistant to physical change around them, such as chairs
being moved around rooms.
184
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

One global mantra you can keep to reduce the chance of sensory overload
when you attempt to introduce different routines is to keep things simple.
Slow down the pace of your instruction, and simplify the information you
give. Your child may have trouble attaching meaning to words you say, so
give him time to make connections, and don’t ever raise your voice.
The following list gives you some more tips for different situations:
 People with autism may fixate on certain activities, words, songs, or
objects. The fixation isn’t a random, senseless act, but an attempt to
compensate or adapt to their inability to effectively connect meaning to
others’ words or actions.
You should attempt to channel these fixations constructively (we give
you suggestions in the section “Working toward functional communica-
tion”), but above all, you should meet these constructions with an
attempt at understanding, not shame and criticism.
 Try to introduce new things, people, or places gradually by talking about
them first. For example, you can “walk through” a visit to the dentist
before it happens to identify people and items or to “watch” another
person’s (mom, sibling) exam. You can also use pictures or other graph-
ics to represent the new experience. Do the things you’d normally do to
comfort a typical child, only do more of them. The familiar is comforting,
and people with autism need more comfort for their jangled nerves.
 Be sure to repeat simple questions you pose and remain patient. Many
people with autism have slowed processing speeds (as slow as 8 to 10
seconds from hearing a request to the beginning of a response), so you
shouldn’t expect immediate responses. Many people with autism also
have trouble accessing their long-term memories; they can store the
information they learn, but they can’t recall facts in new situations when
needed. Use simple, concrete, stripped-down language when giving
directions without introducing extra information that can slow down the
processing of a person with autism.
 Try to teach new information to your child — even social skills, which
Asperger children need help with (see Chapter 5) — through scripts or
“social stories” that break down a process into easily remembered steps.
For example, you can break down the process of getting ready in the
morning into a series of steps, beginning with brushing your teeth and
washing your face and ending with putting on your coat. (See Chapter 13
for a detailed description of social stories.)
The autistic person can learn steps much easier if he or she can see
them in pictures. Books are available with illustrated scripts for many
common activities, or you can create your own social stories at home.
185
Chapter 10: Dealing with Learning and Sensory Differences

Bridging the Communication Gap
Research conducted on families shows that language and communication
deficits are the most serious and stressful aspects of autism. Communicating
successfully is a major challenge people with autism face. Their ability to
communicate dramatically affects how well they interact socially in a non-
autistic world. Many people with autism lack the skill to even request a glass
of water or to ask that the volume of a television set be turned down. Without
the ability to communicate effectively, life becomes an exercise in frustration,
tension, and anxiety.
Because most persons with autism tend to have strong visual skills, a number
of tools have been developed to help with communication and social interac-
tion. In the pages that follow, we explain how you can work toward meaning-
ful communication, implement technologies that can help with
communication, and use music as a tool for communicating.
Developing sign language as a 
communication bridge
For children on the autism spectrum with significantly delayed verbal skills,
early introduction of sign language training can be important in developing func-
tional communication skills. The development of signing skills can also, in some
cases, be an effective bridge toward developing verbal skills. In low-functioning
children, sign language can be the foundation of functional communication.
One common myth is that teaching sign language to a child with autism or
encouraging the use of pictures will delay development in expressive verbal
communication. However, many leading experts believe that introducing
these modes of communication will, in fact, speed up the speech develop-
ment for the children. At the very least, if a child can never gain verbal flu-
ency, he or she will have some form of functional communication.
To determine the appropriateness of introducing sign language at an early
age, consult with a speech and language therapist who’s acquainted with
training children on the spectrum.
Working toward functional communication
Autistic individuals can excel at data collection — gathering facts and figures
like little computers. However, in an educational program, you want to
include life-skill building that goes beyond data collection. The child should
be able to use the data that he collects, and the life skills you build should be
meaningful and have purpose in the real world. In other words, you want to
186
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

practice functional communication. For example, a child should be able to do
math, of course, but he also needs to apply the math he’s learning to the
world so that he knows how to use math to make change when shopping in a
store, for instance. Often, even children on the lowest end of the autism spec-
trum have the potential to develop basic communication skills that allow
them to communicate their most basic needs to others.
A mistake parents make too often with programmed instruction (which we
discuss in Chapter 9) is to focus on academic gains; they miss out on mean-
ingful, functional communication. This results in children who can shoot
through all the exercises in their programs with flying colors but can’t ask for
what they want to eat.
Children who are allowed to play video games for hours or watch television end-
lessly will disengage from the real world because their brains don’t get enough
stimulation. This troublesome fact is true for neurotypical children and doubly
true for autistic children. So, you should pack your child’s day full of meaningful
interactions that keep his mind engaged with the world, not stimming (see the
section “Socially unacceptable stimming”) or tuning out for long periods.
Here are some ways you can promote engagement and connection (in other
words, functional communication):
 Turn off the TV after one video or program, and limit video games to one
hour a day.
 Talk to your child often, even if he or she doesn’t seem to respond. Many
people with autism have delayed sensory processing, meaning they may
not respond immediately or even be able to respond, but they can
understand what’s happening. Like anyone else, autistic individuals
don’t like being ignored.
 Encourage areas of talent, like drawing or computer programming. A
common mistake is to focus on weaknesses to the exclusion of strengths.
 Try to channel your child’s passions or fixations, such as a love for
trains or collecting, into something constructive. Kathy Grant, a high-
functioning person with autism, has turned her interest in maps (she
collects maps, flags, and items with foreign writing) into a vocation of
traveling and writing about her experiences. She has a degree in political
science and has visited Australia and Portugal, among other places.
Using assistive communication technology
Assistive technology is any device used to increase, maintain, or otherwise
improve the capabilities of a person — whether the person has autism or not.
Experts have created assistive technologies such as interactive language
boards, visual schedules, and computerized communication systems to help
187
Chapter 10: Dealing with Learning and Sensory Differences

people with autism — particularly those undergoing speech therapy — to
communicate more readily while they work on improving their speech 
capabilities.
Most people use assistive technology; you just don’t usually call the tools by
that name. Day planners, PDAs, and shopping lists are the primarily text-
based equivalents of visual schedules. (People on the autism spectrum and
otherwise who have difficulty processing text are usually helped by graphi-
cally based visual schedules using low, medium, or high technology to help
remember routines, expected behaviors, and to organize their lives.) E-mail,
text messages, and instant messengers are computerized communication sys-
tems. Restaurant menus are interactive language boards.
Not all assistive technology devices relate to communication; the communi-
cation devices just stand out. Other common types of assistive devices
include eyeglasses and hearing aids. Many of the assistive devices used by
people with challenges are commonly employed by the majority of society
and shouldn’t necessarily be considered “special”. Assistive technology has
provided many new tools for autistic individuals to communicate visually,
which can be their strongest sense. Some parents fear that these methods
may hinder children from using spoken language, but researchers have no
evidence to support this. If anything, helping children build communication
skills lays the groundwork for spoken language.
How does using a visual system help a child to learn language?
Understanding and performing nonverbal communication, such as gesturing
and pointing, is a first step toward understanding verbal language for all
humans. Using a keyboard to communicate doesn’t stand in the way of talk-
ing; it helps language concepts form and develop so that a child can speak
later when he’s ready.
Research suggests that assistive technology positively effects reading and
language skills. Some students have demonstrated greater frequency of spon-
taneous verbal utterances when a computer produced synthetic speech during
learning tasks. Nonverbal people with autism also showed a reduction of chal-
lenging behaviors as their expressive communication abilities increased.
In the following sections, we examine ways you can get assistive technology
into the classroom for your child, and we look at the categories of assistive
technology.
You often have many ways to skin the proverbial assistive-technology cat. For
example, a person with fine motor control challenges may be helped by simply
pointing to and moving Mayer Johnson pictures affixed to a piece of stiff card-
board. Others may find help in using magnetic cards that contain pre-recorded
text with a Language Master. For another person, it may be easier to carry
around a DynaVox or laptop with a touch screen to point at enlarged pictures
that the machine verbalizes. It depends on the requirements of the person.
188
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

Furthermore, assistive technology isn’t a cure-all answer. To have the great-
est benefit for the child, proper training and support are necessary for inte-
grating assistive technology into learning curriculum. Research suggests that
teaching strategies for educators work best when they include a combination
of workshops, modeling, practice in simulated and real settings, feedback
about performance, and coaching during actual practice.
Getting technology assistance into the classroom
The best way to assure that your child’s school provides the needed assistive
technology is to write what your child requires into his Individualized Education
Program (IEP; see Chapters 11 and 12). If you’re lucky, your child goes to a
forward-thinking school that already provides the equipment for student use.
Other schools may have to purchase the equipment if parents demonstrate
the need in IEPs.
Even though it may not seem right, some schools may just outright deny the
need for such equipment by refusing to write it in the IEP. At that point you
may want to consider whether it’s worth appealing the IEP or whether you
want to spend your own funds to acquire the necessary equipment instead.
Keep in mind that low-tech equipment (see the following section) is less
expensive than high-tech equipment. The good news is that, in many cases,
low-tech equipment may be all that your child requires.
When becoming acquainted with assistive technology, you’ll find that low-
tech devices are the most adaptable. For example, you may use a single set of
pictures for a number of applications, such as in developing schedules, shop-
ping lists, calendars, and social narratives.
Low-technology assistance
Low technology refers to visual strategies that don’t involve electronic
devices and that tend to be easy to use. Some examples of low-tech equip-
ment include dry erase boards, clipboards, three-ring binders, manila file
folders, photo albums, laminated graphics (such as those from Picture
Exchange Communication System [PECS]), photographs, and highlight tape.
Some uses for low-tech devices include the following:
 Calendars to assist with memory deficits and routines
 Schedules to assist with routines and changes in routines
 Shopping lists to assist with memory
 Pictures to assist with comparing, identification, or expressive 
communication
189
Chapter 10: Dealing with Learning and Sensory Differences

Building schedules can assist with expressive communication when the child
has the opportunity to help put the schedule together. Working with a sched-
ule can also help with receptive communication (when the time comes to
change from one activity to another, for example).
Developed by Pyramid Educational Consultants, the Picture Exchange
Communication System (PECS; see Figure 10-1) is a database of over 3,000
graphics that can help a nonverbal person with his or her receptive and
expressive communication efforts. PECS works with children, adolescents,
and adults who have communicative, cognitive, and physical difficulties. The
PECS isn’t just a visual support; it involves using a specific protocol (which is
explained in the PECS Training Manual, 2nd Edition, written by Lori Frost, MS,
CCC/SLP, and Andrew Bondy, PhD).
In the first phase of PECS, the person learns to initiate communication by
requesting an item. Later phases involve making sentences and responding to
questions. Although language isn’t necessary in PECS, it often develops
through the use of PECS.
For information on purchasing the PECS, you can go to Pyramid’s Web site at

Another program, Writing with Symbols 2000 (available at www.widgit.com/

Widgit Rebus symbols appear together with words so that a person who
understands only graphics can choose what he or she wants to communicate
with the words appearing under the graphics. Text-based people can type out
text, and the program will include the accompanying graphic.
Medium-technology assistance
Medium technology includes simple electronic devices such as tape recorders,
overhead projectors, timers, calculators, and voice output machines. One
such device, the Language Master, uses 3 x 8-inch cards with recordable mag-
netic strips for short verbal messages; you can place pictures and other cues
on the cards. Another device, the Talk Pad, has four large buttons on which
you can attach pictures, symbols, or other cues to represent the verbal mes-
sage generated when the button is pushed. Other output devices such as the
Voice in the Box and the Step by Step Communicator work in similar ways.
Unlike the low-tech devices, medium-tech items are often less adaptable and
more cumbersome. However, they may be more effective in filling a specific
need of the individual in a limited number of settings or situations.
Some uses for medium-tech devices include:
 Enhancing expressive vocal communication through Voice Output
Communication Aids (VOCAs) that produce synthetic or digitized
speech output when activated by individuals
 Attending (focusing on the task at hand) and organization
 Sequencing (putting things in order) and phonics
Boardmaker, a software program available for both Mac- and Windows-based
computers, uses PECS (see the previous section) and other graphics for
developing communication strips, schedules, calendars, and other materials
for communication. You can use the graphics in conjunction with assistive
communication devices such as DynaVox and the Language Master.
DynaVox is an electronic device that displays a series of graphics, which the
machine verbalizes when the user points to them. One form of the Language
Master, by Franklin, is available in office supply stores and is used primarily
for word pronunciation and definitions. Another form by Drake uses cards
with a magnetic strip to record and play back words and phrases and is
designed to teach reading to children.
Boardmaker and other communication products are available from the Mayer-
Johnson Company at www.mayerjohnson.com. DynaVox is available from
www.dynavoxsys.com. You can find info on the Franklin Language Master at

High-technology assistance
High-technology devices are more complicated but can be very powerful.
High-tech devices include video cameras, computers, and Personal Digital
Assistants (PDAs) that are available from most electronic vendors. You may
need to acquire other high-tech devices from companies that specialize in
selling products for people with special needs. Such devices include adaptive
hardware and specialized and complex voice output devices. For instance, you
may want to check out the Cyrano Communicator, from One Wright Company,
which uses a modified Hewlett Packard Personal Digital Assistant. Look for
more on the Cyrano Communicator at www.cyranocommunicator.com.
High-tech items can be nearly as adaptable as low-tech items and more spe-
cific in use than medium-tech items, but the adaptability or specificity can
come with a large price.
Some uses for high-tech devices include working on improving the following
skills:
 Receptive language skills such as naming objects and people as well as
following routines such as getting dressed or eating breakfast
 Expressive language skills such as categorization (organizing objects or
concepts into groups) and pragmatics (using language in the proper
social context)
 Social skills such as identifying proper behavior, asking for assistance,
maintaining topics, and reducing perseveration (uncontrollably repeat-
ing a gesture, sound, or phrase)
 Nonverbal communication such as body language and facial expressions
 Maintaining personal space and volume of speech
 Activities of daily living such as brushing your teeth, hygiene, and wash-
ing your hands
 Academics such as penmanship, drawing, and essays
Receptive communication refers to what communication a person can under-
stand through listening, seeing, or other means. Expressive communication
refers to making one’s thoughts known to others verbally, through sign lan-
guage, pictures, or other means. People with autism tend to have stronger
receptive communication skills, but just because the receptive skills are
stronger than the expressive skills doesn’t mean that the receptive skills are
perfect or even adequate. On the other side of the coin, good expressive
skills can mask (or hide) receptive skill deficits.
People with autism tend to be attracted to high-tech devices such as com-
puters because of their predictability and consistency, compared to the rela-
tively unpredictable nature of human responses. Computers don’t send
confusing social messages, and they place the person in control, allowing for
her to become an independent learner.
192
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

Computers can help autistic individuals who have motor problems to com-
municate. Even if a person can’t hold a pencil, she still may be able to type.
Many individuals with autism have trouble with their handwriting, also. Using
keyboards can free them from the difficult task of holding a pen to paper,
which makes communicating their thoughts easier.
Enjoying music therapy
Music therapy is the process of using music to address the physical, emotional,
and social needs of an individual. In other words, it focuses on achieving non-
musical goals, such as body and environmental awareness, motor control,
social interaction, and communication, using music as the medium. Although
autism affects neurological structures involved with speech, research shows
that communication through music often remains intact. This strength, in
some cases, allows music therapy to assist individuals on the spectrum to
better express their feelings and improve their communication skills.
Music therapy may look like a therapist and child just “having fun” together.
In actuality, the music therapist needs extensive education and training in
order to become properly certified. Upon certification, the therapist is quali-
fied to use music as a means to enhance social, communication, and physical
skills. The therapist pays close to attention to cues from the participant as he
or she reacts to music and attempts to channel the hopefully positive reac-
tions into more meaningful social and emotional expression.
Music can benefit people who have autism in many ways. Check out the fol-
lowing benefits:
 Provides another (nonverbal) form of communication
 Gives kids the potential to do something they may be good at
 Provides an enjoyable forum in which to interact
Music communicates with a different part of the brain than language. Research
suggests that involvement with music at an early age encourages neural con-
nections in the brains of children during periods of critical development.
Music can be inclusive even for low-functioning autistic people who can’t
follow directions well. It provides an opportunity to connect with others
without language and to have fun.
If we’ve sparked your interest in this therapy, you can contact the American
Music Therapy Association (www.musictherapy.org) for more information
about music therapy and to find a certified music therapist.
I (co-author Stephen Shore) teach autistic children how to play musical
instruments. I focus on teaching instruments such as piano or recorder,
193
Chapter 10: Dealing with Learning and Sensory Differences

depending upon the student’s interest. Unlike the relationships created in a
music therapy class, where the teacher puts the emphasis on using music 
to accomplish extra-musical goals, music lessons for autistic individuals pro-
vide a way for them to make friends and get involved in the community, per-
haps as a member of a local band. Above all, you need to remember that
music can be plain old fun.
Make sure you have music around the house. Whether you put on classical,
jazz, or rock and roll, the person with autism is likely to have a response. If
the response is negative, that type of music is probably not the person’s
favorite. To people with autism, as with all people, music allows them to tap
into thoughts and feelings they may not consciously be aware of. People use
music for entertainment, to relax, or as a reward for a job well done. People
with autism are no different. My parents played mostly classical music for as
long as I can remember. I feel that my intensive exposure to music played a
key role in my leading a fulfilling and productive life, and it has led me to the
role of teaching children with autism how to play musical instruments.
Other arts, such as drawing, painting, and writing, are similar. Some people
with autism have exceptional visual memories and can reproduce scenes
from memory that look like photographs in their detailed accuracy. Try your
best to include the arts in your family’s life.
“Retraining” the Brain 
through Neurotherapy
Neurotherapy (also called neurofeedback) is a noninvasive form of mental train-
ing, similar to the biofeedback athletes use to achieve better physical perfor-
mance. Neurotherapy, however, trains not the body, but the brain itself. You
can actually train your brain to be calmer through this technique, and many
autistic individuals who use this intervention see some excellent results. (High-
functioning individuals with more intact communication skills will more likely
benefit from this therapy.) One of the best results? The therapy often reduces
the need for medications. Keep reading to find out how the therapy works,
how you can implement it, and for some research-based testimonials!
Neurotherapy isn’t a medical treatment; it’s an educational one that works to
condition the brain to re-regulate itself. To get the best results, you should use
neurotherapy in conjunction with a program that addresses other needs of 
the autistic individual within the family system. You need to manage other
194
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

environmental stressors, in other words, for neurotherapy to have lasting and
significant benefit. You may want to let your primary care physician know that
your child is participating in neurotherapy in order to facilitate communica-
tion with the physician about the overall treatment plan of the child.
Examining and implementing neurotherapy
Why does neurotherapy work? At one time, scientists believed that your
brain stayed the same throughout your lifetime. Neuroscientists today con-
tinue to discover that the brain is an amazingly flexible and adaptable organ
(often described as plasticity), particularly when you’re young. This makes it
a prime candidate for transformation.
How does neurotherapy work? Neurotherapy uses electroencephalography
(EEG) tracings that show electrical activity, or brain waves (which is why the
therapy is also known as EEG biofeedback). Neurotherapy clinicians believe that
autistic individuals have far too much delta and theta activity (greater than 50
percent of their total brain waves), so they look for this during examinations.
The slow delta and theta waves — usually displayed on a neurotypical
person’s EEG when he or she’s asleep, not awake (see Figure 10-2) — create
sleepiness. The individual with autism tries to cope by revving up his brain,
which can cause him to get “stuck” with inappropriate levels, leading to
hyperactivity and sleep problems. The focus of neurotherapy is to re-regulate
these brain waves.
During a neurotherapy session, the neurotherapist attaches an electromagnetic
sensor to the client’s head at specific locations while the client observes a
simple video game or series of images (see Figure 10-2). The sensor rewards the
client’s brain for achieving the desired state during the game with beeps and
point scoring. By giving this reward, the therapy trains clients to calm their
minds, ease their pain, or heal their trauma. The process is painless, safe, and
has no side effects. And the intended effects of the treatment are involuntary —
that is, the client doesn’t need to understand what’s being done to benefit from
the treatment.
To find a competent neurotherapy practitioner, you can contact EEG
Spectrum International, located in Canoga Park, California, on the Web at
www.eegspectrum.com. If you want to know more about the emerging field
of neurofeedback in general, we recommend that you check out A Symphony
in the Brain (Grove Press), by Jim Robbins.

Reviewing a neurotherapy study
One pilot study conducted in 2000 compared a control group with groups
undergoing neurotherapy for an average of 36 sessions over 41⁄2 months. The
study, which was published in the Journal of Neurotherapy, showed a 26-percent
reduction in autism symptom levels for people undergoing neurotherapy,
compared with 3 percent in the control group.
During the study, parents noticed significant improvements in socialization,
vocalization, sleep, and schoolwork, and they noticed less anxiety and
tantrums. The study conductors also tested children undergoing neurother-
apy with the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (you can access an Internet
scoring program for the checklist at www.autismeval.com/ari-atec).
The kids showed a 33-percent improvement in sociability, a 29-percent improve-
ment in speech/language/communication, a 26-percent improvement in overall
health, and a 17-percent improvement in sensory/cognitive awareness.
For a scientific look at neurotherapy and autism, you can check out an
upcoming book that includes a chapter by the author of the controlled study,
Dr. B. Jarusiewicz. The book is Neurofeedback: Dynamics and Clinical
Applications, edited by J.R. Evans (Haworth Press, Inc.).

Making Sense of Sensory Confusion
Imagine not knowing where your body ends and other objects begin. Imagine
feeling pain when you hear high-pitched or loud noises (and yes, we’re talking
pain worse than hearing a loved one nag you). Imagine being able to use only
one sense at a time — not smelling and tasting your pizza at the same time, for
example. These are some of the descriptions autistic people have used to talk
about their sensory worlds. In the pages that follow, we give you tips on man-
aging the sensory challenges that your loved one may face, and we present
some techniques and therapies at your disposal to help your loved one cope.
Observing sensory integration challenges
Occupational therapists practicing sensory-integration therapy divide the
senses into inner and outer categories (see Figure 10-3). The outer senses are
the five you learn in grade school: sight, touch, hearing, taste, and smell. The
two important inner senses are the vestibular and the proprioceptive. The
vestibular sense helps you keep your balance, and the proprioceptive sense
tells you where your body parts are in space and how much force you need
to use to accomplish a task. Therapists term anything that overwhelms one
or more of the senses as a sensory violator. See Tables 10-1 and 10-2 for more
on what differences in sensory input may feel like for autistic persons.
The inner and outer senses of people with autism aren’t always reliable indi-
cators of the world around them. The senses can be either insensitive or
oversensitive to stimulation, and one sense can be highly acute while another
is dull. How can a person learn in an educational setting in the typical way
when the information she receives from her senses is often faulty or slow to
arrive? Well, the person can’t.
197
Chapter 10: Dealing with Learning and Sensory Differences
Sensory integration dysfunction as an autistic trait
I (co-author Stephen Shore) have yet to meet a
single autistic person who doesn’t have issues
with sensory integration to some extent. One
friend I have claims to have no sensory integra-
tion problems at all. However, I have to wonder
why he draws the shades down in his home
with the lights off, leaving him to live in the dark.
Here are some other quirky tidbits:
 While in a library with another friend of
mine one time, I suddenly noticed her eyes
vibrating back and forth to the frequency of
the fluorescent lights. She quickly asked to
leave.
 I have to remove all the ticking clocks from
anywhere I sleep.

Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

Why do autistic individuals process sensory information so differently?
Various scientific theories have attempted to explain what’s going on. One
explanation is that autistic brains have too many sensory connections and
develop so rapidly that their “circuits” are easily overloaded with information
coming in from their senses. Research has shown that children (under age 12)
with autism have larger brains than average children; however, adult brains
are normal in size, due to slower-than-average brain growth after age 12. One
possible cause of this early brain growth is that a left-hemisphere defect may
cause the right side of the brain to overcompensate by becoming larger.
Another theory for the difference in sensory processing is that the presence
of environmental toxins distorts neutral processing.
If you’re interested in sensory therapy, you should find an occupational ther-
apist who has experience administering assessments for sensory integration
and providing the needed therapy. You’ll enjoy the benefit of having a child
who’s more balanced and happy, and with activities such as swinging, rolling
up in mats, pulling, and pushing, the therapy tends to be fun for the child and
the therapist, too. You can find further information and qualified therapists
by contacting the organization Sensory Integration International at www.
sensoryint.com. In addition, your physician, hospital, and local autism
support group or resource center can be fine sources.

Chapter 10: Dealing with Learning and Sensory Differences
Tomatis: From opera to occupational therapy
Auditory integration training, a currently con-
troversial (but growing in popularity) form of
sensory integration without much research
backing, is designed to reduce hypersensitivity
and improve clarity of hearing. When Dr. Alfred
Tomatis first developed this training in France,
people used the “Tomatis method” to train opera
singers with a device called the Electronic Ear.
This listening therapy uses sound stimulation
through the electronic earphones to improve the
attention, hearing, and sensory-processing
capabilities of autistic people.
Listening therapies are just that — people lis-
tening to specially designed music through
headphones, sometimes while doing other
activities. The therapist adjusts the music peri-
odically to filter different frequencies out, which
is claimed to stimulate different parts of the ear
or the brain.
Some practitioners use the training today,
including Dr. Paul Madaule, who runs the
Listening Centre (the first facility of its kind in
North America) — a facility based on the
Tomatis method in Toronto. Dr. Guy Berard
applied Tomatis’ ideas to develop the modern
version of auditory integration training, or AIT,
for people with autism and other neurological
conditions. The Spectrum Center in Bethesda,
Maryland, employs a combination of listening
therapy and physical movement. Although the
medical jury is still out, this whole-body
approach claims to improve motor skills, coor-
dination, and balance along with helping listen-
ing, memory, and attention skills.

The easy-to-administer and score Sensory Profile Assessments for different
age groups, created by Dr. Winnie Dunn, are very helpful in determining the
sensory needs of your loved one — whether or not he’s on the autism spec-
trum. You can get copies of the assessments from Harcourt Assessment at
www.sensoryprofile.com. A significant cost is associated with this
assessment, and as such, we suggest that you consult with your physician or
other members of your child’s autism treatment team before you contract for
an assessment.
Because sensory integration treatments are so new, much of the evidence for
them is anecdotal. Research shows that children can benefit from several
aspects of these treatments even if they don’t show specific sensory gains.
Children can benefit from the social engagement, focused attention, and use
of toys in meaningful contexts that the therapy gives, for example.
Using hippotherapy
Like with sensory-integration therapy (see the previous section), hippother-
apy focuses on organizing the inner and outer senses. However, with this
unique modality, the child rides on the back of a horse! A therapist
acquainted with hippotherapy and a specially trained horse conduct hip-
potherapy sessions. The child heightens her awareness by developing her
vestibular and proprioceptive senses, which she accomplishes through using
her trunk muscles to maintain balance on the horse. Additionally, the child
benefits psychologically by learning how to communicate with and develop a
relationship with the horse.
Another similarity to sensory-integration therapy is that the sessions are usu-
ally fun. You can find more information about hippotherapy, including where
to find a certified therapist (and horse!), from the American Hippotherapy
Association at www.americanhippotherapyassociation.org. Generally,
therapists can adapt hippotherapy to assist children across the autism 
spectrum.
Working with speech-language 
pathologists
Speech-language pathologists work to improve speech and communication
and can be part of school services (for more on education, see Chapters 11
and 12). When schools employ speech therapists, they’re required to provide
as many hours as is stipulated in your Individualized Education Program (IEP;
see Chapters 11 and 12), but sometimes parents want more help and hire other
therapists — either people working for the school or outside contractors — to
work additional hours with their child. The American Speech and Hearing
200
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

Association, a trade group, accredits therapists and schools in its industry.
You pay out of pocket for their services, and rates vary depending on where
you live. In the New York City metropolitan area, therapists generally receive
$75 to $90 an hour.
Before your child becomes a part of speech therapy, though, make sure the
therapist involved understands how to work with people with autism.
Some speech-language pathologists are traditionally trained to focus on speech
and language rather than communication. Therefore, you need to find a person
who understands that communicating within a meaningful context, not just
producing speech, is the goal of training a person with autism (see the section
“Working toward functional communication” earlier in this chapter). Especially
with children with Asperger’s, who have no language delay, the focus needs to
be on pragmatics, or learning conversational skills and how to read visual cues
around language. If a therapist is inexperienced with autism, you may want to
bring up the fact that people with autism need more visual aids.
Low-functioning children on the autism spectrum can also benefit from
speech training. Speech training with children who are non-verbal involves
getting them to vocalize, even if they just babble, and then rewarding that
behavior until it becomes habitual.
Another type of therapy typically performed by speech-language pathologists
is known as feeding therapy, which encourages children to eat new foods and
helps them with any swallowing problems they may have. Many autistic chil-
dren eat an extremely limited diet because they’re averse to foods that have
textures and smells they don’t like. Feeding therapy can help them eat a more
healthy, varied diet. (See Chapter 8 for more on optimizing nutrition for your
child.) Pathologists with a background in feeding therapy often help autistic
children by using integrative sensory techniques (see the section “Observing
sensory integration challenges”).
Seeing through Irlen-branded lenses
Helen Irlen, a former school psychologist and current Assistant Professor of
Adult Learning Disabilities at California State University/Long Beach, esti-
mates that almost 50 percent of people with autism have scotopic sensitivity,
or unusual sensitivity to lights, glare, patterns, colors, and contrasts. Drawing
on federal research from the early 1980s, Irlen developed what are now
known as Irlen lenses to filter out colors of the infrared spectrum that inter-
fere with visual perception in persons on the autism spectrum.
If you (or people you care for) have visual difficulties, Irlen lenses may help.
Examples of difficulties include sensitivity to light intensity and glare, tunnel
vision, troubles with reading because letters on the page seem to move, and
trouble seeing contrasts.
201
Chapter 10: Dealing with Learning and Sensory Differences

If you have difficulties, you may want to consider going to a display that has
sunglasses of different colors. Trying different glasses while reading a short
passage may reveal that some colors are easier for you to read with than
others. If so, you have unofficially screened yourself as a possible candidate
for Irlen lenses. (You often hear suggestions for this exercise at Irlen lens pre-
sentations; we say “unofficially” because this isn’t standard practice by those
selling the lenses.)
As with all interventions, Irlen lenses help some persons with autism and not
others. You can find more information about Irlen lenses, including locations
for assessments for this intervention, at www.irlen.com.
Handling Your Child’s Sensory Issues
If your autistic child is hypersensitive to noise or barely notices loud noises,
you can tell he or she has unusual auditory processing. But what can you do
about it? And how do you know if he or she has visual problems? Not to
worry, we’re here to help. This section gives you tips on how to discover and
handle visual, hearing, and other sensory problems, and how to deal with
socially unacceptable stimming.
For general purposes, though, here are some suggestions, proposed by
Temple Grandin, PhD, to cope with your child’s sensory issues:
 You can treat hyperactivity with a padded, weighted vest that calms the
nervous system when worn for short periods. You should remove the
vest after 20 minutes so the nervous system doesn’t adapt to it.
 Don’t always expect a person who can’t hear and see at the same time to
look at you while taking instructions. Some autistic people, such as
Donna Williams, acclaimed author of Somebody Somewhere: Breaking
Free from the World of Autism (Three Rivers Press), can process informa-
tion from only one source at a time, such as vision or hearing.
 For older, nonverbal children and adults who have come to depend upon
touch as their most reliable sense, give them a physical symbol of some-
thing to touch, like a spoon, to remind them of events such as mealtime.
The supermarket test
Public places, such as supermarkets or large department stores — with their
loudspeakers, ringing bells, fluorescent lighting, crowds, strong smells, and
202
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

other distractions — can be overwhelming sources of stimulation. If your
child has tantrums and becomes unmanageable in such places, but you can
take him to a place like the park and he remains calm, you can be pretty sure
something is going on. Children who are mono-channel (only processing one
sense at a time) or who are tired out are likely candidates for throwing
tantrums in supermarkets.
If your child has a tantrum in a public place such as a supermarket and your
attempts to soothe the child don’t quickly quell the outburst, we suggest
removing the child from the provoking environment. This removal will help
limit the stress the child endures when in a panic-like state. We also suggest
that you contact your child’s physician, therapist, or other treatment
providers to seek suggestions on behavior modification elements that can
address tantruming behavior.
The eyes have it
One way you can tell if your child has visual processing problems is by
observing how she handles uneven steps. If she responds with fear or tenta-
tiveness, she probably has trouble with depth perception. Some children
with autism also have trouble making out bright, contrasting colors.
After you have your child’s vision tested by an eye doctor, you should make
an appointment with a developmental optometrist — a professional who spe-
cializes in testing how a person processes vision.
Here are some other signs that your child may have visual processing problems:
 She looks out of the corners of her eyes rather than straight ahead.
 She flicks her fingers around her eyes.
 She avoids checkerboard-tiled floors.
 She won’t ride escalators.
Fluorescent lights are very distracting for many autistic people because they
flicker, especially when the lights become older. Use incandescent bulbs around
your home when possible. Even if fluorescents are present, a lamp with an old-
fashioned bulb next to the child’s work area helps. Similarly, flat-panel displays
and laptops are less distracting than standard computer monitors.
Irlen-colored glasses (see the section “Seeing through Irlen-branded lenses”)
can also help with visual processing problems, as will black print on colored
paper for reading. Don’t ever use bright yellow, though!
203
Chapter 10: Dealing with Learning and Sensory Differences

The auditory-processing blues
Many autistic people are said to “hear in vowels.” In other words, the individ-
uals miss consonant sounds like the “c” in cat. When spoken aloud, such
hard consonant sounds are actually shorter in duration than vowels, which
makes them easier to miss and harder to process.
This type of auditory processing problem doesn’t show up on a conventional
hearing test because many autistic people have compensated for the prob-
lem. Sometimes people with autism even talk in vowels.
One way you can help is to speak slowly and enunciate your words clearly.
Singing may also be easier than speaking for people with autism. You can sing
to them and encourage them to sing back. Imagine the fun you can create!
Don’t sing too loud if the person is extremely sound-sensitive, though. A
whisper may be enough volume.
People with autism not only feel pain from loud sounds, but also can be dis-
tracted or irritated by sounds most other people can’t hear. For example, the
flickering of fluorescent lights is accompanied by a hum or buzz that some
people can hear. This buzz or hum can be as distracting or irritating as the
flicker. Other people may be distracted by the scratching of a pencil on paper
or a conversation occurring in the next room.
You can protect a child with autism from sounds that hurt his ears by record-
ing the sounds on a tape recorder, allowing the child to imitate the sounds,
and gradually increasing the volume to a tolerable level.
Socially unacceptable stimming
People with autism may insist on repeating certain behaviors, such as flap-
ping their hands, rocking, spinning, flicking their fingers, or reciting the same
songs or sentences for a few different reasons:
 To deal with overactive nervous systems
 To defend against situations they find anxiety provoking
 To reestablish awareness of their bodies in space (some autistic people
have reported that they can’t feel their bodies unless they move, which
leads to disorientation)
This self-regulatory behavior is called stimming. The average brain isn’t
immune to such behavior; most people do it to up-regulate their brains in
204
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

order to pay attention or to down-regulate when they feel too much anxiety.
Think of the possible up- or down-regulatory movements you may make
while sitting in class or a meeting:
 Jiggling your leg
 Biting the end of your pen or your nails
 Twirling your hair
 Doodling
 Slightly rocking back and forth
So, what’s the difference between your movements and someone with
autism? Most adults have mastered “socially acceptable” stimming behavior.
When stimming interferes with learning or social situations, the behaviors
can cause problems for an autistic person. You should attempt to stop stim-
ming behaviors when they present a danger to the individual or others
around him. For example, you should cut off repetitive skin picking or head
banging immediately. If the stimming prevents a child from participating
effectively in therapies — such as when the child practices continuous hand
flapping that prohibits the use of writing implements — you should stop the
behavior if possible.
One way to interrupt the stimming is to distract the child from what he’s
doing with a prompt to do something else. Indirect redirection works best.
However, allowing the person with autism some time to “get it out of her
system” may be the better approach. Stimming that doesn’t present potential
physical risks or take away from learning opportunities can generally be left
alone.
In some instructional programs, children with autism are rewarded for finish-
ing a task with a short period of stimming. Other instructional programs
teach socially acceptable stimming, or they teach socially acceptable meth-
ods to excuse yourself so you can stim in private and then return.
Unless the individual is in immediate danger, don’t physically restrain him
from stimming, which may only lead to agitation and aggression. Also, you
shouldn’t make the child feel guilty or uncomfortable about his behavior — it
fulfills a need the child is experiencing. Your job is not to let the child stim for
long periods and disengage from others to an extreme. You want him to be
free to be himself, but you also want him to be able to learn and respond to
his environment when appropriate.

Chapter 10: Dealing with Learning and Sensory Differences

Dealing with the most severe behaviors
Parents need to pay attention to safety of their children first. Whether your
child tantrums, stims, flees, or insists on other behaviors, you must provide
safety first and foremost by addressing any behaviors that present acute
threats to his individual safety directly. The greatest morbidity and mortality
associated with a spectrum diagnosis is associated with accidents (falls,
drowning, being hit by a car, and so on).
Whereas hands-on therapy modalities can contribute greatly to learning and
growth for individuals on the spectrum, medications are often necessary to
help address behaviors that present risk to a person on the spectrum.
Potential medication benefits include reduced aggressiveness, self-injury, and
extreme, repetitive behaviors.
When you address any severe behavior that your child exhibits, we suggest
that you consult your child’s physician for an assessment of medication
appropriateness.

That Fits Your Child’s Needs

 Arranging for the proper educational accommodations
 Considering education options besides public schooling
 Handling your child’s challenging behaviors
P
eople with autism spectrum disorders display great diversity in learning
styles and characteristics. Yet, you can focus on some generalities that
can make a classroom an effective place for people with autism to learn. You
can’t stop at the classroom, though; the physical classroom is just one com-
ponent of a quality education. You also need to rely on faculty, aides, and
other personnel who understand (or at least comprehend) and can teach
autistic children.
In this chapter, we take a look at what an effective classroom looks, sounds,
feels, smells, and maybe even tastes like. We include important characteris-
tics to look for in educators. We discuss some ways to approach the educa-
tion of children with autism and show you how to develop accommodations
and promote successful inclusion. Finally, we look at strategies for handling
the inevitable challenging behaviors all autistic students exhibit from time to
time. We hope that with the information we provide in this chapter, you can
work with your child, his or her school system, other parents, and your
child’s peers to make the educational process as smooth, enriching, and
enjoyable as possible.

Inclusion: To Be or Not to Be?
Inclusion is the strategy of including a special-needs student in a classroom
with regular-education students. Successful inclusion occurs when, through
proper support and planning, both the child with special needs and the 
regular-education students benefit from being in each other’s presence. At its
best, inclusion provides rich lessons about the positive aspects of the diver-
sity of the human race. At its worst, inclusion places a child in an environ-
ment that fails to meet his or her special needs and that may be intimidating
and uncomfortable. Successful inclusion in the school setting builds a foun-
dation for the involvement of people with disabilities and other differences at
home, the workplace, the community, and in society as a whole.
Although schools may give the impression that inclusion is an all-or-nothing
proposition, the reality is that you can choose from many different scenarios.
In fact, you can think of inclusion as a spectrum ranging from 0 to 100 per-
cent. The following list presents ways to look at how the range of inclusion
can work for students who have special needs (ranging from 100-percent
inclusion to 0-percent inclusion):
 The student spends all his time in a regular-education classroom.
Students at the 100-percent end need direct or indirect support from an
aide or other school employee part or all of the time.
 The student spends most of his time in a regular-education setting, with
or without support. He spends the rest of his education experience in a
resource room or self-contained special-education room.
 The student divides his time equally between the regular-education
room and a resource room or self-contained classroom.
 The student spends most of his time in a special-education setting, but
he eats lunch with, has recess with, and participates in art, music, or
physical-education classes with regular-education peers.
 The student spends all his time in a special-education setting within the
public school.
High-functioning children on the spectrum may be able to spend more time in
a regular classroom. In particular, individuals with Asperger Syndrome (see
Chapter 5) who possess fluent language skills may be able to integrate into a
regular classroom for the majority of the school day. When you consider that
where a child falls on the spectrum influences inclusion planning, the impor-
tance of determining where a child falls on the spectrum becomes clear. The
child’s physician and other treatment team members should work in concert
with school personnel to clarify where the child falls on the spectrum and
where he should spend his time in the school setting. (Chapter 2 discusses
the different classifications of autism, and Chapter 4 discusses receiving a
diagnosis from medical professionals.)
208
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

A child’s Individualized Education Program (IEP) should reference where the
individual is on the spectrum and discuss what educational adaptations can
best meet the needs of someone falling at that particular place on the spec-
trum (see Chapter 12 for a full discussion of IEPs). Parents and teachers
should engage in consistent dialogue after diagnosis (see Chapter 18 for more
actions to take immediately following a diagnosis). This dialogue should
include discussions of how the school can best meet the educational needs
of the child, given the impairments inherent in being at his particular level of
the spectrum.
Recognizing an Effective Classroom
When you enter a classroom, whether it’s a regular-needs room or a special-
education room, you can sense when the teacher has suited the classroom
for the education of students. For example, an effective classroom may fea-
ture the day’s topics highlighted on the walls of the room in a concise and
engaging manner. Such practices are signs of good teaching and should take
place in every classroom.
In this section, we discuss important elements that you should look for in
your child’s learning environment.
You should visit your child’s classroom often in order to understand what the
teacher is currently emphasizing in class, which allows you to reinforce the
classroom learning at home. For example, parents can make connections like,
“That stop sign is red. Your teacher has a picture of red letters in your class-
room.” If the classroom doesn’t seem to be conducive to your child’s learning
style, make some suggestions. For example, if the class is stark and devoid of
engaging visual cues, you could gently suggest to the teacher that because
your child is a visual learner, visual cues and points of emphasis placed on
the classroom walls would be helpful to your child’s ability to learn.
Maintaining routine and predictability
Routines are important to everyone. Most people can successfully work
through changes, such as a change in class schedule because of a school
assembly or a detour from the daily commute, with no more than some
annoyance at the unexpected changes.
A person on the autism spectrum, however, may react to such changes with
meltdowns or tantrums if they occur without warning. Educators used to insist
on not making changes in the lives of people with autism. That insistence
proved somewhat unrealistic, however — after all, life is full of changes. It all
boils down to preparation. Providing proper notification of the changes can
make life much easier for people with autism and for the people around them.
209
Chapter 11: Finding a Learning Environment That Fits Your Child’s Needs

If your child is already enrolled in a class, ask your child’s teacher to post the
class schedule and call attention to any change before it happens — by high-
lighting it on the board, for example — to make the modification easier to
handle. If you’re looking for a satisfactory classroom for your child, make
sure that the teacher clearly posts daily and even weekly expectations on the
walls. It’s also helpful to have the day’s activities in order of occurrence
posted in plain view. You may attempt to suggest to a prospective teacher
that keeping the class on a regular routine would be helpful to your child.
210
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 
Blending special and regular needs
Take a moment to digest the following class-
room descriptions and look for their defining
characteristics:
You open the door of Susan’s classroom to
find a buzz of activity — like a beehive but
not overwhelmingly loud. Today’s schedule
hangs on the wall near the blackboard, indi-
cating that you’re walking into science class
and that today’s topic is geography. The
schedule then draws your eye to a high-
lighted announcement of a school assem-
bly — highlighted because it’s a change
from the daily routine. Hearing laughter, you
turn to see Susan laughing off a spill that
occurred as she was helping a small group
of students work on a project depicting ero-
sion in a sandbox. The sandbox is painted to
look like a tropical paradise. “I guess my
sweater doesn’t erode as quickly as the
sand,” you hear Susan say.
One of the two other adults helps a student
select four pictures that represent the sea-
sons from a bin to stick onto a piece of card-
board. The adult narrates his every move
like an excited sportscaster at a hockey
game. You also note similarly styled pictures
stuck all over the room, depicting doors,
windows, the teacher’s desk, today’s
weather, and even a toilet — a sticker one
child uses to gain permission to go to the
bathroom.
The other adult divides her time between
two separated groups. The first group is
examining the smells and tastes attributed
to a country in Northern Europe by sampling
examples of local dishes. In the second
group, one of the students is pointing to a
map and reciting countries, their capitals,
and their populations in a loud monotone
voice, very much like a professor. “He must
have swallowed an encyclopedia,” you
think to yourself. After a few minutes, a
person, whom you later learn is a covert
aide, walks over to that student, calmly
places her hand on his desk, and the mono-
logue stops.
After some time, Susan stands up from her
place at the sandbox, walks to her desk,
and holds up her hands as a nonverbal cue
for the students to pack up their work and
prepare for music class. In few minutes, the
music teacher walks into the class to begin
musical activities. The aides stay behind,
and you talk with Susan about her teaching
philosophy, all the while wondering if this is
the right place for your autistic child.
From this description, you may be wondering,
“Is this a special-education class or a regular-
education class with autistic children?” We
purposely leave that determination vague to
emphasize that quality education is pretty simi-
lar when it comes to instruction for regular-
education students and for those with special
needs.

Learning through all the senses
Just as you observe diversity in the learning styles of people in the general
population, you see great diversity in the learning styles of people with
autism. However, the two populations show a marked difference in one area:
Although most people can learn by using their weaker senses, people with
autism may find it impossible to educate themselves through their weaker
senses. As a result, the more diverse a classroom can be when it comes to
sensory teaching, the richer the experience for all children involved.
Your job is to advocate for your child to experience learning in many diverse
ways. When you find a setting that seems to fit your child’s needs, you can
begin advocating for his sensory needs during discussion of his IEP (see
Chapter 12), as this plan can direct your child to receive services presented in
diverse ways to maximize the potential for learning. After you advocate for an
IEP sensitive to sensory issues, you can continue to prompt your child’s teacher
to maintain the tenets of the IEP in her daily classroom activities. Finally, if you
feel that the teacher isn’t following the IEP in the classroom, you can appeal to
members of the school’s administration to ensure that the IEP is enforced.
The following list presents some approaches you can advocate for your
child’s teacher to use to create a multi-sensory environment in order to maxi-
mize her students’ learning abilities (see Chapter 10 for more on dealing with
sensory differences):
 Visual: Most people on the autism spectrum are visually oriented. A
classroom can take advantage of this fact by including visual props to
aid in learning. A posted schedule of the day’s activities is one example
of a visual prop. Having a student place pictures that depict the seasons
on a piece of cardboard is another example.
 Touch: Teachers can encourage connections by asking children to
describe how certain objects feel. For example, when working on letters
or sounds, teachers can come up with examples with distinct “touches”
to help children understand more about the topic under discussion. One
tactic could be using a fuzzy piece of material when going over the
spelling word of the word “fuzzy”. Asking children to describe how
“fuzzy” feels not only promotes language development, but also rein-
forces memory of the word.
 Sound: Sound can be an important cue for any child on the autism spec-
trum. As with touch, teachers can incorporate the use of certain sounds
into the classroom to reinforce topics of discussion. Teachers can ask
children to describe certain sounds and then use their descriptions as
the jumping-off points for meaningful discussions among classmates.
One technique to improve auditory learning is the narration technique.
Developed by Arnold Miller, the narration technique replaces the often-
heard “good job” uttered by people working with autistic children with
an excited, emphatic description of what the child is doing, such as
211
Chapter 11: Finding a Learning Environment That Fits Your Child’s Needs

“Billy is walking up the stairs!” As described in Dr. Miller’s writings, one
benefit of narration is that instead of uttering a “good job” to compli-
ment achieved goals, people can help children learn to attach words to
their actions.
Sound can also be distracting to children on the spectrum. Classroom
objects that promote dissonant sound can include tile floors or fluores-
cent lighting. Incandescent lighting and the use of rugs can help reduce
these distracting background noises.
 Smell and taste: If a child can smell or taste a particular object, his or
her ability to maintain lasting memory of the object is increased.
Teachers can use edible/fragrant objects such as fruits to reinforce
memory of certain sounds or letters.
 Kinesthetic: A child with Asperger Syndrome who recites the names of
countries, their capitals, and their populations as he points to them on a
map uses his kinesthetic sense. Other students who observe these
actions employ their visual and aural senses. The power of motion can
also reinforce learning and the development of memory in many class-
room scenarios. For example, asking a child to use his hands/body to
imitate shapes can reinforce a day’s lesson in geometry.
Evaluating the room itself
Think about your workspace or the workspaces you see on television or in
retail stores/restaurants you go to. Does every item in the space have a place,
212
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 
Benefiting your child by violating his or her senses
Herman Fishbein, former executive director of
the League School of Greater Boston for
Children with Autism, had the unique opportu-
nity to build a school for autistic kids from 
the ground up. One of his goals was to create 
a completely sensory-friendly environment.
However, it soon became clear that the sensory
oasis the League School provided didn’t repre-
sent the world at large. As a result, Herman
constructed a “sensory violation room” that’s
more characteristic of the environment the chil-
dren will transition to after graduation. The sen-
sory violation room is actually a simulated
convenience store, complete with whirring
refrigerator units, fluorescent lights, and a radio
playing in the background.
Parents and educators learned three important
lessons from this sensory violation room:
 Some autistic students had no problem with
the convenience-store environment.
 Some students with sensory issues could
accommodate for the noisier environment.
 Many students found out that they shouldn’t
even entertain the idea of working in an
environment similar to that of a conve-
nience store.
Be sure to stay in tune with your child’s sensory
needs, and do your best to make sure that his or
her classroom complies with those needs.

and is every item in its place? If you work in an office, can you see your desk,
or is it covered with papers? Are the tools of your job — a computer, pens,
paper, and so on — organized for maximum efficiency? Have you included
pictures of family, knickknacks, and other non-work items to give your space
personality?
People organize workspaces to promote efficiency, and a classroom should
be no different. Your child’s classroom should be organized to create a warm,
inviting place for students to learn and grow. The following list presents some
aspects of a room well prepared for children with (and without) autism.
Make sure you work with your child’s teacher to help create this environ-
ment. Don’t be afraid to show her this list! If your child’s teacher resists
brightening up his room with inviting visual cues, for example, consider
informing the school administration that your child and others in the class-
room would benefit from positive visual classroom displays. Another option
is to consider finding another educational situation, preferably within your
child’s current school, if you run into continued resistance from educators or
administration.
 Personal touch: The room should reflect the personality of the teacher
and his teaching style. For example, a teacher with an artistic flair may
draw simple murals describing current classroom material. A teacher
with an outgoing, happy personality may place positive statements
around the room to encourage children to work hard.
 Layout: The geography of the room is very important. The layout should
be logical and easy for both children and teachers to get around. For exam-
ple, the room should provide sufficient space between the desks for people
to walk around. However, all desks should have an easy line of sight
between the students, teacher, blackboard, and other props the teacher
uses for the class as a whole. Cramping children together increases the
chance that a child on the spectrum would be easily distracted.
 Good ventilation: Studies have shown that people are more productive
when they work in rooms with good air circulation and a comfortable tem-
perature. Just think of how your production would decrease if you were
sitting in the economy section of an airplane on a long flight! Children on
the spectrum may notice poor ventilation and noxious odors more readily
than others, thus increasing their classroom distraction level.
 Appropriate noise level: Active learning tends to be a bit noisy and may
seem a little disorganized. However, if noise levels are so high that the
teacher or children can’t hear themselves think, the room is too loud.
Because children on the spectrum often have keen and even hypersensi-
tive hearing, distracting noises can greatly decrease their ability to focus
on classroom work.
 Comfortable lighting: Studies show that people are more productive
under nonfluorescent lighting. Natural lighting should be employed as
much as possible. Many children on the spectrum are very sensitive to
lighting that other children may be able to accept.
213
Chapter 11: Finding a Learning Environment That Fits Your Child’s Needs

 Appropriate furniture: The furniture should fit the students and be in
good condition. Clunky furniture can cause classroom accidents and
injury, particularly for children on the spectrum with any motor skill
delays.
 Clean and tidy: Tidy classrooms are more conducive to teaching and
learning. A disorganized classroom presents children on the spectrum
with confusion that decreases their ability to focus on classroom work.
 Additional equipment and space to support routines: For example,
near the entrance of the room, you should find a space for students to
leave and retrieve their outer clothes, knapsacks, and other possessions
as they enter and leave. Depending on the developmental level of the
children (and your child), you may see additional cubbyholes or other
areas to retrieve or deposit schoolwork. Children on the spectrum can
benefit greatly from classroom areas set aside to promote daily routines.
 Rules and a code of conduct: Sometimes, the school supplies the rules
or develops them with student/parent input. Autistic children should
follow the same classroom rules with regard to safety boundaries (no
hitting, kicking, and so on), but the teacher may need to make some con-
cessions if a child on the spectrum can’t follow the classroom rules (for
example, no moving in your seat for a child who exhibits automatic
behaviors like repetitive movements).
Ask your child’s teacher (or potential teacher) how she feels about the
rules or code of conduct hanging in her classroom. The enthusiasm she
expresses can tell you plenty about her teaching philosophy and
approach.
 Display of student work: The room should feature a place or places for
student work — be it math, art, or other projects — displayed for all stu-
dents and visitors.
Check to see if the displays look new rather than old, faded, and tat-
tered. A fresh display area is a good indication that the teacher cares for
the students and their education.
 Learning stations: Ideally, the room should have areas dedicated to cer-
tain activities. Examples of different areas for work include the following:
• Computer area: An area with one or more computers dedicated to
enhancing learning, improving break time, and serving as a reward
for completing work.
• Opening-circle, closing-circle, or story-time area: Depending on
the level of the students, engaging in these transition activities at a
particular time can be helpful for transitioning in and out of school.
• Quiet-time area: A low sensory stimulation area that children can
use to rest from sensory overload or to quietly read. The teacher
should expect a child sitting in this area for a break from overstimu-
lation to do his work there rather than at his desk. This expectation
prevents the quite-time area from becoming a way to escape work.
The break also helps the child begin to focus on his next task.
214
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

• Other areas: Depending on the size of the room and the objectives
of the teacher, you may find additional areas for reading, writing,
creative arts, and listening.
Observing a Good Teacher
The challenge of educating children with autism falls on both special-needs
and regular educators, along with the various aides, therapists, and other
school personnel that provide assistance. And you can’t forget about the
very important role of the parents. But when a child is away from his parents,
the biggest burden falls on the teacher. Therefore, you need to make sure that
this person can handle the burden and give your child the best education
possible in the best setting possible.
In this section, we review the characteristics of teachers who promote strong
learning environments for children on the autism spectrum, and we examine
characteristics than can hinder a spectrum child’s ability to learn. No matter
the status of the children she oversees, a good teacher can be a real asset to
her students’ ability to maximize their school experience.
Characteristics to look for in an educator
When you observe a teacher’s classroom (see the previous section,
“Recognizing an Effective Classroom”) and have discussions with your child’s
teacher or prospective teacher, keep the following list of words in mind.
These words represent characteristics or behaviors that you should look for
in an instructor, starting off with the all-important positive attitude — a must
for the educator of a child on the spectrum:
 Positive attitude. The teacher should seem very happy with what she’s
doing, and you should see it in her interactions with the children and
others in the classroom. A positive attitude goes a long way toward pro-
moting a happy, engaging classroom environment and is the foundation
for many other positive characteristics that promote a good classroom
environment.
 Creativity. Does the teacher make the learning environment stimulating
and fun while still catering to the needs of her students? Will your child
be excited to attend class? Maybe your child’s classroom or prospective
classroom is the first place you’ve seen a sandbox painted like a tropical
paradise.
 Enthusiasm. The teacher should seem eager and full of energy, both in
class and during conversations with you.
 Fairness. Does the teacher’s classroom provide for the needs of all stu-
dents, giving them an equal chance for success? Note: Being fair doesn’t
215
Chapter 11: Finding a Learning Environment That Fits Your Child’s Needs

necessarily mean giving the same kind of support for each child. An
autistic child needs more support than other children in many cases,
and a low-functioning child may need more (and different types of) sup-
port than a child with Asperger’s.
 Fallacy. Hopefully you won’t observe the teacher making any mistakes
while teaching, but if you do observe mistakes, you hope that she
promptly owns up to the errors and apologizes to her students.
 Flexibility. Does the teacher understand that the individual needs of all
her children should dictate her lesson plans? Does she adapt her plans
daily to meet these needs? From sensory to stimming needs, a teacher
should be flexible enough to adapt her teaching style to all her kids,
giving each child an equal opportunity to succeed.
 Has high expectations. Do most of the teacher’s students strive to meet
her high expectations? High-functioning children on the spectrum may
be able to better understand the motivation behind trying to meet
expectations.
In one well-known study, conductors gave a regular-education teacher a
group of children who historically performed below grade level and told
the teacher that these students were high achievers. As a result, the
teacher had high expectations of the students and worked hard to
enrich their curriculum, and the students strove to meet the teacher’s
high expectations.
 Humorous. You can find humor in unexpected places when it comes to
autism, and the classroom is no exception. The teacher should take the
high road of laughter rather than the angry option when harmless
mishaps occur or students take creative projects in crazy directions.
 Prepared. Does the teacher project mastery over the material that she’s
teaching? Does she have a handle on how she can best teach the mater-
ial to the comprehension level of her students?
 Provides emotional safety and compassion. Do all the students appear
to belong to the classroom? Do the students go to the teacher with
issues or concerns and feel safe doing so? You may also want to ask the
teacher how she handles bullying, an unfortunate companion to autism
in the school environment (see Chapter 5).
 Respectful. Does the teacher seem sensitive to the feelings of her stu-
dents and work to reduce embarrassing situations? Does she respect all
students, no matter their ability or function level, as the whole persons
they are?
Warning flags to avoid in an educator
Certain personality traits you observe in prospective teachers for your child
should cause great concern — concern enough that you should keep on look-
ing (and wonder how they got into teaching in the first place). Parents should
216
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

engage in constant dialogue in anticipation of a negative classroom environ-
ment before they put their child in that classroom. If your child reports that
his once-happy learning environment is becoming a hostile classroom, you
should make an effort to advocate for change within the classroom before
you remove the child, because removal from the classroom often brings its
own transition stress that can inhibit a child’s ability to learn.
Here are some behaviors that make your child’s learning environment
unhealthy and harmful:
 Negativity. Just as a positive attitude should lead to teacher characteris-
tics that promote learning (see the previous section), negativity can lead
to characteristics that create a hostile classroom. Good educators focus
on how they can facilitate their students’ successes instead of concen-
trating on their limitations.
Parents of children on the spectrum need to find out if negative traits
are developing in their child’s teacher. If so, parents may need to report
what they’re noticing to the teacher’s supervisor.
 Lack of humility. The best educators work for their students, realizing
that no one has all the answers. The teacher should be willing to admit
when she makes a mistake.
 Yelling. The only good reason to yell at a student is to avoid life-
threatening danger (and even then, yelling may only increase panic). Of
course, every good teacher is bound to have an “off day” and yell at a
student. However, that should be an extremely rare occurrence.
Often, parents don’t have a choice of teachers for their child. In such cases, it
makes sense for parents to try to be proactive with their child’s assigned
teachers. Being proactive includes making suggestions without sounding like
you’re passing negative judgment on the teachers. Suggestions for improve-
ment often go over better than direct condemnation. If the proactive
approach doesn’t work, you can react by talking with school administrators
about your concerns.
Developing Effective Accommodations
One of the biggest differences between the instruction of children with
autism or other special needs and regular-education students centers on the
degree of accommodations children with special needs must have in order to
have an equal chance of achieving success in the world of education.
Accommodations. A scary sounding word? Maybe, but only for teachers.
Accommodations are vital to an autistic child’s education, so you should get
comfortable with the term. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
(IDEA) is a law that, among many things, requires all teachers to read a stu-
dent’s Individualized Education Program (IEP) and develop accommodations,
217
Chapter 11: Finding a Learning Environment That Fits Your Child’s Needs

or changes in the methods of teaching and assessing a student that give the
student an equal chance of success in his education as the regular-education
students. Wow! That’s a mouthful, and enough to scare off most teachers.
Many teachers are terrified by the idea of having to make accommodations.
(For more on the IDEA and IEPs, see Chapter 12.)
The fright comes from the changes in teaching style, the issue of fairness that
may arise, and dealing with other students’ reactions to the accommoda-
tions. Your job is to find a teacher who’s up to the challenge (see the previ-
ous section for more info on finding the right teacher) and work with her to
develop the proper accommodations, along with the child’s IEP team. This
section sets you down the road to development. Here, you see accommoda-
tions in action, you examine the issue of fairness, and you find techniques
that promote inclusion in the learning environment.
Although teachers play a primary role in developing accommodations based
upon the IEP, you know your child best, so you should work with teachers if you
have suggestions for how your child can best learn material in the classroom.
Accommodations in action
To figure out how accommodations actually work in practice, consider the
following common teaching strategies:
 Write an outline of today’s class on the blackboard.
 Provide a handout that summarizes the Krebs Cycle in biology.
 Allow the kids to write out a test on paper or take it orally.
Now look at how these same strategies work when the teacher makes accom-
modations for specific students in the classroom:
 Write out an advance organizer for Sam, who has Asperger Syndrome, so
he can follow the sequence of events in class. Sam could get a copy of
the schedule in written form in addition to the outline on the board.
 Provide a handout that summarizes the Krebs Cycle in biology for
Rebecca, who has Pervasive Development Disorder — Not Otherwise
Specified. The teacher may decide to give handouts to all students
because they can be helpful to students with and without autism spec-
trum disorders.
 Allow for an alternate assessment of learning through different output
modalities for Aaron, who has been diagnosed with autism.
What’s the difference in the educational intent between the first and second
set of accommodations? None! The only difference is that what were origi-
nally common examples of good teaching practice have been written as
accommodations in IEP-speak.
218
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

Accommodations, believe it or not, aren’t that big a deal. They’re generally
just extensions of good teaching practice. Because of the great diversity of
people on the autism spectrum, teachers can’t provide a single set of accom-
modations that work for every student. Developing appropriate accommoda-
tions is a combination of understanding a student’s learning style and knowing
what educational (and other) adjustments a teacher can make. Sometimes,
the development requires hatching some new techniques on your own.
Figure 11-1 is the beginning of what we call an enhanced laundry list of
accommodations from co-author Stephen Shore’s book, Ask and Tell: Self-
Advocacy and Disclosure for People on the Autism Spectrum (Autism Asperger
Publishing Company). The objective of this list is twofold:
Objective 1: To consider which accommodation or accommodations are
suitable. If educators and parents have previously used an accommoda-
tion, they can rate it on a scale of 1 to 5 for its effectiveness. A low score
means the accommodation wasn’t effective, and you may want to recon-
sider using it. A high score means you should strongly consider using
that accommodation.
Objective 2: To increase awareness of the different types of accommoda-
tions that exist, with an eye toward developing even more possibilities if
no current accommodations are suitable.
Addressing the fairness 
of accommodations
The topic of fairness often comes up when teachers and parents discuss
making accommodations for students with autism. Is it fair to give someone
two hours to complete a test when the regular-education students have only
one? Or what about letting a child with difficulty in penmanship answer her
test verbally rather than in writing? Why should the teacher provide notes
for one child but not the rest of the class? Is this fair?
Suppose you’re dining with friends in a restaurant, and a piece of food gets
stuck in your airway, preventing you from breathing. A waiter comes over
and apologizes, saying that while he’s trained to give the Heimlich maneuver
to restore your breathing ability, he can’t because he wouldn’t have the time
to serve all his other patrons.
Just as it is fair to provide you with the Heimlich in your time of need to
equalize your chance at survival, it’s fair to provide students what they need
to have an equal chance of succeeding in their education. The other patrons
aren’t choking, so they don’t need the same assistance, just as the regular-
education students don’t have your child’s problems. It would be pretty hard
for other parents to argue this fact. What position would they rather be in?

Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

If or when fairness becomes an issue with your child’s teacher or prospective
teacher, other students, or other parents, be sure to reinforce with those
questioning the accommodation that the changes afforded your child only
attempt to put him on an even playing field — not to give him a leg up on the
classroom. Parents who encounter questions of fairness should make it clear
that their child suffers from a disorder that greatly impacts his ability to learn
in standard ways. To treat all children in exactly the same way would put 
special-needs children at great disadvantages.
Issues of fairness tend to impact high-functioning kids more because more
people believe high-functioning kids on the spectrum are getting an advan-
tage, whereas low-function children may be more apt to receive “pity”
because others feel they’re markedly different and deserve accommodation.
If you want to fight the battle head-on, attempt to advocate for your child by
educating the ignorant about the issues that come with Asperger’s and other
forms of high-functioning autism.

Chapter 11: Finding a Learning Environment That Fits Your Child’s Needs

Considering educational techniques 
for promoting inclusion
Successful inclusion (of special-needs kids into a classroom setting) can be
very challenging for regular and special educators alike. In this section, we
include nine ways to promote inclusion, adapted from the text Adapting
Curriculum and Instruction in Inclusive Classrooms: A Teacher’s Desk Reference,
by Deschenes, Ebeling, and Sprague (The Center for School and Community
Integration, Institute for the Study of Developmental Disabilities). The tech-
niques use accommodations that aid in providing meaningful education to
both the special- and regular-education students. Your child’s teachers
should look at these techniques and try to incorporate as many as possible
into their accommodation planning. We also encourage parents to take this
list to their IEP team meetings.
 Amount of information. Adapt the number of items that the teacher
expects the student to learn or complete.
Example: You can reduce the number words the student must learn for
the weekly spelling test.
 Time allotted. Adapt the time allotted for learning, task completion, or
testing.
Example: Individualize a timeline for completing a task; increase or
decrease the pace of learning.
 Level of support. Increase the amount of personal assistance with a spe-
cific student.
Example: Assign peer buddies, teaching assistants, peer tutors, or cross-
age tutors to work with the student.
 Input of material. Adapt the way you give instruction to the student.
Example: Use different visual aids and as many senses as the child is
able to learn with when teaching; plan more concrete examples; provide
hands-on activities; place students in cooperative groups.
 Difficulty of material. Adapt the skill level of the work, the problem
types, or the rules on how the student may approach the work.
Example: Allow the use of a calculator to figure math problems; simplify
task directions; change rules to accommodate learner needs.
 Output of answers. Adapt how the student can respond to instruction.
Example: Instead of requiring the student to answer questions in writing,
allow a verbal response. You can also use a communication book with
some students or allow students to show knowledge with hands-on
materials.
222
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

 Participation requirements. Adapt the extent to which the learner is
involved in the task.
Example: In music, have the student hold a flag of the country the song
is from. Or in geography, have the student hold up the map while others
point out locations.
 Alternate expectations. Adapt the student’s goals or your outcome
expectations while allowing the student to use the same materials as
other kids.
Example: In social studies, expect the student to locate only the states
while others learn to locate the capitals as well.
 Substitute curriculum. Provide different instruction and materials to meet
a student’s individual goals while still aligning with the class curriculum.
Example: During a language test, the student can learn computer skills
such as keyboarding in the computer lab, enabling the completion of
writing assignments.
Take care to make sure that the curriculum substitution technique doesn’t
result in geographical inclusion. Check out the sidebar “Geographical inclu-
sion” for details on the subject.
The common goal behind these and other accommodations is the meaningful
involvement of the person with a disability in school, as well as at home and
in the community. This goal holds true for people across the autism spec-
trum. Low-functioning children may need more and different accommoda-
tions than individuals with Asperger’s (see Chapter 5) or other forms of
high-functioning autism, but the goal remains the same.
223
Chapter 11: Finding a Learning Environment That Fits Your Child’s Needs
Geographical inclusion
While observing a music class some time ago, I
(co-author Stephen Shore) noticed a child with
Down’s syndrome being kept very busy with
some unrelated work in the back of the room.
Although he seemed well behaved, he would
occasionally make an inappropriate sound,
causing the rest of the students to turn around,
which distracted from the lesson. The music
teacher then had to regain the attention of the
class to continue. This happened four or five
times during the class period.
What did all the children learn in class that day?
I can be pretty sure the child with Down’s 
syndrome learned whatever he was doing 
with the aide, but it certainly wasn’t music. The
regular-education children merely learned that
people with disabilities really are different from
everyone else. The inclusion of the child with
Down’s syndrome was limited to only his loca-
tion, which is why I call it geographical inclu-
sion. Geographical inclusion can lead to lasting
stigmatization that can stay with a child on the
autism spectrum for years to come. This method
of inclusion only emphasizes differences, 
thus labeling a special-needs child as merely
“different”.

Weighing Your Options when the 
Public School System Falls Short
As students, parents, and society place more and more demands on educa-
tors, they have less time to properly understand and respond to the needs of
students on the autism spectrum. Sometimes, the public school system as a
whole is unable to provide for all the needs of a child — especially when
these needs are unique. In these cases, the community is required to fund the
student’s education at a special school or residential program. Occasionally,
students may need to (or parents may want them to) receive their education
at home or even at a hospital.
With the cost of out-of-district placement often passing the six-figure mark,
many schools systems are reluctant to go this route. However, if you truly
feel that placement in another district is in the best interests of the person on
the spectrum you’re caring for, you may want to strongly consider engaging
the services of a special-education advocate or lawyer. Problems with place-
ment outside a given school system often occur with low-functioning children
and others whose behaviors and needs at times render them impossible to
accommodate within their assigned school districts.
Exploring the world of home schooling
The decision to home school is a very serious one. Some states are develop-
ing standards for students who are home schooled, making the process
tougher. All students have the right to a free and appropriate education in a
public school. You shouldn’t feel the obligation to home school your child just
because the school system can’t accommodate him. Prior to settling on home
schooling, you should be allowed to exhaust all means, including legal action,
to try to get your local public school system to accommodate the needs of
your child. A good question to ask yourself is, “Will my child be better off in a
home-school situation that I can provide for him than where he is now, given
what the school system will provide?” (For more on examining classrooms,
teachers, and accommodations, see the previous sections in this chapter.)
The answer for each child varies. You must weigh the available resources in
the community against the resources that you, the parents or guardians, can
bring. Frequently, a family living in one community is better off home school-
ing their autistic child, while an autistic child just down the road in a neigh-
boring town can obtain a better education in school. You should consider
exhausting many options prior to home schooling — especially if you’re not
very comfortable home schooling your child.
224
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

Choosing to home school means that public education isn’t a good fit for 
the child at this place and at this time. It doesn’t necessarily reflect the qual-
ity of the educational institution, and it doesn’t mean that your decision is
permanent.
Here are a couple areas to consider when deciding how well the public
school environment suits the needs of your child:
 Academics. Academics includes what and how the child learns. Is the
required curriculum taught in a way that she can understand? Are edu-
cators and other personnel approachable? Do they seem to understand
and respect your child? Are reasonable accommodations made?
 Social. Do school personnel and other classmates interact respectfully
with your child, or is he a target for bullying?
Choosing to educate a child at home is a serious responsibility that involves
a lot of time, money, patience, organization, and learning on your part. Here
are some more aspects of home schooling to account for before you make the
decision to teach a child at home (this list is intended to provide an idea of
what’s involved, not to cover all the issues):
 Both parents must agree.
 You have to have sufficient time to teach the child. Expect that teaching
your child will amount to a full-time job. You’ll most likely spend as
much teaching time at home as teachers do in school.
 You need to understand the significant financial commitment involved.
Expect that the costs of home schooling may approach the costs of
schooling a child within the private school system; however, you have to
pay costs of possibly $10,000 or more yourself depending upon how
much outside help you hire. (See Chapter 9 for more info on financing at-
home programs.)
 You should have a willingness to learn about teaching. Parent-teachers
need to keep up with new and innovative education techniques just like
classroom teachers. An Internet search on Home Schooling Autism will
reveal many Web sites, such as homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/
weblinks/autism.htm, and other resources for educating your child
at home.
 You need to have a plan for supplementing the child’s socialization.
Parent-teachers must plan to integrate their child into some social set-
ting with peers to promote effective social development.
 You need to determine if home schooling is right for you, the caregiver. If
you have fears or misgivings about meeting the requirements for home
schooling, this baseline stress may only worsen after you become
responsible for your child’s special-needs education.
225
Chapter 11: Finding a Learning Environment That Fits Your Child’s Needs

A good start in making this decision is to contact other parents who
have home schooling experience. You can also ask therapists and other
professionals working with autistic children, and you can contact your
local autism support organization (such as the Autism Society of
America) to help you locate parents to talk to.
Considering other educational options
Other schooling options outside of public school, private school, and home
schooling include educational opportunities at residential treatment facilities
and special schools for individuals with developmental disabilities.
Although choosing to send your child to a residential facility is a difficult
step, at times this may represent the safest and most appropriate option for a
child on the autism spectrum. In particular, low-functioning children who
exhibit intense maladaptive behaviors (aggression, self-injury, and so on)
may need to learn within a controlled residential environment. If you think
you need to consider this difficult decision, you should talk to a knowledge-
able psychiatrist, psychologist, or other relevant professional.
You may worry that having your child live at a facility where education is pro-
vided will weaken the bond between you and your child. What you need to
understand is that above all other priorities, your child’s safety must come
first. If your child presents great risk to herself or to others by being in a
home-schooled or classroom environment, residential treatment with associ-
ated special-needs education may be the best and safest option available for
learning.
Understanding and Reducing
Challenging Behaviors
A child protests and drops to the floor when asked to work with other students
in class or do his homework after school. Another child throws a tantrum with-
out any definable reason (known to you; see Chapter 10). A student with
Asperger Syndrome suddenly decides to eat her lunch outside of the lunch-
room. These are just a few examples of what are known as challenging behaviors,
or behaviors contrary to expectations that are difficult to deal with. It can be
hard to get the child back on track after the behavior starts. Parents, educators,
and other caregivers are challenged to figure out the causes of such actions.
226
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

Getting to the core of the behavior
Understanding the cause or causes of challenging behaviors, rather than just
focusing on the actions, is the key to achieving meaningful success (in other
words, reducing the challenging behaviors). You need to consider a few
things that surround the behaviors to understand the behaviors. For autistic
kids, more so than neurotypical kids, environmental factors often play a big
part in behavior. Here are some surrounding events to check out:
 The setting events: The time of day, weather, food allergies, or any other
factor that may be relevant
 The antecedents: What happened just before the incident
 The consequences: What consequences occurred as a result of the
behavior
Performing a Functional Behavioral
Assessment (FBA)
A Functional Behavioral Assessment (FBA) is a powerful key for addressing
challenging behaviors. A clinician who has experience in assessing behavior
in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders should conduct
the assessment. The “clinician” position may be filled by a physician, psy-
chologist, or social worker. You can consult your local educational laws to
see if FBAs are a requirement if requested by a parent.
Some uses for the FBA include the following:
 Identifying the purposes of specific behaviors
 Selecting interventions for behavioral issues
 Integrating interventions through all stages of the Individualized
Education Program (see Chapter 12)
One of the keys to the success of the FBA is that it looks beyond the specific
behavior by identifying the social, affective, cognitive, and environmental fac-
tors associated with the occurrence of the behavior.
According to the Center for Effective Collaboration and Practice Web site,
cecp.air.org, conducting an FBA requires you to follow six steps, which
we outline in the following list:
227
Chapter 11: Finding a Learning Environment That Fits Your Child’s Needs

1. Describe and verify the seriousness of the problem.
In other words, concretely define the challenging behavior and indicate
just how serious the behavior is. Seriousness has to do with effect. Is the
situation confined to just the student, or is the behavior affecting others
or possibly endangering them? In other words, is the behavior frequent
enough or serious enough that it interferes with the learning of the stu-
dent or his peers?
Here’s an example of stating the problem and making it concrete (see
Figure 11-2):
• Problem: Alice displays out-of-seat behavior in math class.
• Concrete: After the teacher introduces the subject of the day’s math
class, Alice starts running around the room and shuts off the lights.

2. Refine the definition of the problem behavior.
Complete this step with both direct assessment (seeking the cause, iden-
tifying the behavior, and reinforcing consequences that maintain the
action through actual observation) and indirect assessment (talking to
others in the child’s life about their observations on the behavior). An
example for using the direct assessment form follows:
•

228
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

Direct Assessment (see Figure 11-3):
• Antecedent: Alice manages to stay in her seat for a few minutes 
and then begins to rock and vocalize before jumping out of her seat.
• Behavior: Alice runs around the room and often stops to look out
the windows. She seems to flap less when she’s near the windows.
When she gets to the light switches, she turns the lights off.
Usually, Alice returns to her seat after shutting off the lights.
• Consequence: Alice’s teacher sends her to the time-out room. Is
Alice being inadvertently reinforced to shut off the lights?
If Alice is inadvertently being reinforced to shut off the lights, you need
to consider as many reasons as you can. One motivation for Alice may
be that the lights are overwhelming her sensitive eyes.
Indirect Assessment (see Figure 11-4): Other people should write their
observations on a child’s challenging behaviors on this form.
3. Collect information on the possible function of the problem behavior.
Every behavior serves a purpose for the autistic person (to communi-
cate, to relieve anxiety, to self-stimulate, to exert control over his envi-
ronment, to escape, to avoid, and so on). You have three general
categories to keep in mind when determining behavioral function:
• Behavior is communication. People with autism may have no
other way to communicate that they’re experiencing sensory over-
load, having difficulty with transitions, or are unable to communi-
cate needs or wants than with challenging behavior.
• Social or tangible reinforcement. This category is less common
than many people think. However, if a child seems to be “seeking
attention” from adults or peers, you should show that the child can
receive attention in other, more positive ways.
• Escape or avoidance. Seek to determine what’s perhaps difficult or
boring about a situation. Why may a child be seeking to avoid
interaction with a particular person?
4. Analyze the information. You have three ways to analyze behavioral
information, which will hopefully result in a plan for resolving the chal-
lenging behavior:
• Data triangulation. This method is just a fancy way of determining
if your observations jive with what others have seen. Use the form
in Figure 11-5 to get started.
For example, finding out that Alice behaves differently in, say, an
art class that occurs before lunch may provide valuable insights
for determining the cause of and finally modifying the behavior.
Possible causes for her behavior may include food allergies and
not understanding what’s expected of her.
229
Chapter 11: Finding a Learning Environment That Fits Your Child’s Needs

• Problem pathway analysis. You determine the sequence of events
by writing down the setting event(s), antecedent event(s) that
comes before, problem behavior(s), and the maintaining conse-
quences (what keeps the behavior happening again and again).
Check out Figure 11-6 for the pathway analysis form.
From the material you’ve developed so far, you trace the behavior
from what may be affecting Alice prior to school or your class all the
way through what may be encouraging the situation to continue.
• Competing problem pathway analysis. This step adds to the
material you write for the problem pathway analysis sheet (see
Figure 11-6). By filling out this form, you include solutions (or
accommodations) that can create new behaviors and new main-
taining consequences for the child.

For this analysis, you include competing events (what goes on that
interferes with the inappropriate behavior), replacement behaviors
(behaviors that a child can perform in place of the challenging
behavior), and desired behavior (which you would like to see in
place of the problem behavior). See Figure 11-7 for a form outline.
5. Create a hypothesis statement regarding the probable function of the
challenging behavior. Based on the reason(s) you find through your
research into the situation, you develop an educated guess as to the
cause or causes of the behavior.
6. Test the hypothesis. See if the behavior repeats in similar situations.
Find out if the behavior is extinguished when accommodations are made
or if other, more positive behaviors are modeled to replace the challeng-
ing behavior.

The situation you observe needs continual monitoring. If the challenging
behavior returns or another unsatisfactory situation develops, you need to
find out what has changed in the child, both in and out of school. Also, as a
child matures, he will experience different setting events, antecedents, and
maintaining consequences surrounding behavior.

T
he law says every child — regardless of disability — deserves an appro-
priate education. When you get down to brass tacks about what that edu-
cation should entail, communication often breaks down. However, the
process need not be nightmarish, adversarial, or confusing, and it won’t be if
you understand what public schools are legally bound to do for their special-
needs kids and what your role is in making it happen.
In this chapter, we explain your child’s rights under federal law and what you
can expect your school system and other professionals to do to meet your
child’s educational needs. We also help you decipher some of that education-
ese and show you how to ensure that your child gets the educational ser-
vices to which he or she is entitled.
Navigating the Legal and 
Education Systems
Although it may seem like you’re on your own at many times during your battle
against the worldview of disability, you do have the law on your side when it
comes to education. An autism diagnosis is considered a disability under fed-
eral law, and all children with disabilities — whose disability adversely affects
their educational performance (remember this distinction) — are legally eligi-
ble for special services.

In the following pages, we outline some laws that aid you in your tug of war
with the education system, and we help you keep track of the changes in leg-
islation that affect your child’s education. It helps to have people you trust
on your side, so we also provide a few tips to lead in you the right direction.
Understanding what the law allows
Knowledge is your most powerful tool when working with your child’s school
district to ensure that he or she receives an education comparable with other
children. And when it comes to knowledge concerning the law, you have to get
used to some acronyms. Here comes the onslaught: Under the Individuals
with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA); its reauthorization, the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (IDEA 2004); and other related
federal laws, schools must provide a disabled child with the following:
 A free appropriate public education (FAPE), starting at age 3
 An Individualized Education Program (IEP) for children in school
 An Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) for preschoolers (ages 3–5)
at risk, which takes into account the “strengths and needs” of parents
 A least restrictive environment (LRE), which keeps the child included in
regular education as much as possible
However, if the child receives more educational benefit by enrolling in a
more restrictive program, the courts may favor that program.
 Active parental involvement in the process, including the right to attend
every meeting about the child and examine all educational records
The law that ensures access to records and confidentiality is called
FERPA, or the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.
 Extended school year (ESY) services if a child needs help in the summer
to maintain his or her progress or to keep from regressing
 Annual reviews of the IEP (see the section “Assessing Your Child’s
Progress” for a possible exception in the new law)
Armed with all the legal rights afforded by the law, you want to maximize your
child’s educational opportunities. After you make sure you understand what the
law says, you can become actively involved in how your school system imple-
ments it in your child’s education, with the IEP and other federal creations.
Keeping track of changes in the law
The legislation dealing with education for children with disabilities changes
from time to time, and so does the way the courts interpret it. We don’t have
236
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

space to list most of the changes taking place of late, but we can give you
some recent examples of what can change:
 The federal government now describes free appropriate public educa-
tion (see the list in the previous section) as including preparation for
“further education, employment, and independent living.” The govern-
ment added the part about “further education” in 2004.
 As of 2002, states are now required to ensure that disabled students
meet appropriate “adequate yearly progress goals” that children under
the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLBA) must meet.
 Teachers must be fully qualified to teach special education according to
the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) of
2004.
 Diagnostic assessment measures, which are the foundation of IEP plan-
ning, must now be based upon sound methodology, according to the
IDEA.
For more details on special education legislative changes, you can consult
the U.S. Department of Education Web site (www.ed.gov, or more specifi-
cally www.ed.gov/parents/needs/speced/edpicks.jhtml?src=sm)
and your own state department of education site for the latest information.
At these sites, you can request publications put out by the Office of Special
Education Programs (OSEP) so you can find out more about your legal rights.
You can also find many helpful books on special education law that will
explain how to advocate successfully, such as Wrightslaw: From Emotions to
Advocacy — The Special Education Survival Guide (Harbor House Law Press,
2006) by Peter Wright and Pamela Darr Wright, two experts on the subject.
The bad news is that schools are becoming overwhelmed by a steep rise in
special education students, and states are pushing to reduce paperwork by
evaluating IEPs less often than once a year. Congress can reimburse states for
up to 40 percent of the average per-pupil expenditure in public elementary
schools and secondary schools in the United States, but the funding usually
falls short, leaving states and schools to pick up most of the tab for the new
legislation.
Often, under-funded federal mandates, on top of a shortage of special educa-
tion teachers, mean that schools must balance the needs of children against
their tight budgets.
What does this all mean for you? It means that your role in advocating for the
child is critical. Try to develop strong relationships with educators, but know
that even if schools want to do the best for their children (which they always
assure you!), finances constrain them.

Chapter 12: Legally Speaking: Making the Most of Your Child’s Education

Staying Involved with Your 
Child’s Education
Three situational factors can make or break your child’s education:
 The quality of your child’s teachers
 The match of your child’s Individualized Education Program (IEP) with
his or her needs
 Active parental involvement in the process
We concentrate on the last point here, because you have the most control
over it. (The rest of this chapter covers IEPs, and Chapter 11 talks about how
to evaluate classrooms.)
This may seem too obvious to state outright, but we hope you give us some
slack: Parents who take an active role get better results. The law requires that
all team meetings about a child’s education be open to parents, so take
advantage of this by showing up. Even if you don’t say much, you hear what
others say, and your mere presence there says something.
Memory often fails us in times of stress. Consider recording the meeting
using an audiotape for review later when you’re more relaxed. Make sure
you’re clear in your intent to tape the session.
Working within the system
Find an informal advocate in the school, such as a teacher or school psychol-
ogist whom you trust, to keep you informed and help you work within the
system. And stay informed yourself, particularly about progress toward the
goals in your child’s IEP, which is so important that we devote most of this
chapter to the subject.
Closer to home, you can attend board of education meetings and ask ques-
tions. Some questions you can ask about your school or district include the
following:
 Does the administration provide support for special education? Is the
administration spending available money for programs?
 Does the school system have a staff development program for special
education professionals? Are the staffers keeping up with current theory,
or are they stuck in outdated understandings of autism?
238
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

Educators may be experts in their fields, but you’re the expert about your child.
Don’t be intimidated by any education-ese you may hear. People you deal with
should always communicate clearly with you about what they’re doing and why.
If you don’t understand a point, politely ask for an explanation in layman’s
terms. As educators, it’s their job to educate you, too. However, taking an adver-
sarial approach by, say, being accusatory or threatening early on is a good way
to make enemies fast, not to get what we assume you really want: wholehearted
cooperation and interest in your child’s progress from people who can help.
Supporting your child at home
Within the three most important factors in your child’s education — parental
involvement, the IEP, and quality teaching — you have the most control over
how you support your child at home. The IEP should spell out what your
responsibilities are, as well as the school’s.
A child’s education isn’t like ordering a meal in a restaurant; you can’t order
and then forget about it until the waiters bring your food out. You have to go
into the kitchen and do some cooking yourself! Here are some informal steps
you can take to help the process along:
 Find out what skills your child is working on in school, and spend some
time at home reinforcing them.
 Share what you work on at home with your child’s teachers, and ask if
the school can reinforce those skills.
 Ask your child’s teachers what you can do to help at home; they’ll
appreciate the question.
 Set high (but reasonable) expectations, but be emotionally supportive of
all progress.
Be willing to adjust your expectations (up or down). Just because you
have to adjust expectations downward doesn’t mean that you can raise
your expectations again later. Sometimes, you need to address a hidden
(masked) barrier before a child can reach your original expectation.
 Make sure that the timelines you set for reaching goals are reasonable,
based on the student and the methods used.
Outstanding individuals who exceed their supposed limitations usually
do so because somebody working with them refuses to believe in those
limits.
 Communicate well, and develop trusting relationships with teachers and
other educational professionals who can help.
Parents and educators need to be sure that they all speak the same lan-
guage about what’s expected and what’s happening in the classroom.
 Join a parents’ support group.
239
Chapter 12: Legally Speaking: Making the Most of Your Child’s Education

Don’t base your judgments on rumors or solely on what you hear from
other parents — their needs and circumstances may be quite different
from yours. Talk directly to the people involved at the school.
Acting Early with an Individualized
Family Service Plan (IFSP)
For a child with autism, early intervention is the single most important factor
for quality of life, and the sooner the better. A child who receives intensive
help before beginning kindergarten has a much better chance of not falling
far behind.
American law requires that each state have early-intervention programs for
babies and toddlers considered to be at risk of developmental disabilities, up
to the age of 3. This law requires the states to have resources available; how-
ever, they don’t have to pay for the programs.
Starting at age 3, though, local school districts are required to provide ser-
vices to parents. These preschool programs, often called Individualized
Family Service Plans, or IFSPs, are directed at helping parents, who need all
the support they can get. Within 45 days of a child’s evaluation and accep-
tance of eligibility for special-education services, an IFSP meeting must
happen. This program, unlike the IEP, is targeted to helping the entire family,
not just the child. When the child enters the public school system, the IFP no
longer applies, and the child’s needs are evaluated on an individual basis, not
as part of a family unit.
An intervention at this stage may be able to reduce or even eliminate the
need for more special education services for the rest of his or her school
years. Such a development would be a good thing for everybody, and you
should raise this point if the school district balks at your requests for special
services. Not paying now may mean paying much more later.
Possible early interventions may include the following (Chapters 9 and 10
have more details on interventions):
 Educational/behavioral interventions, such as Applied Behavioral
Analysis (ABA) and Floortime
 Complementary interventions, such as sensory integration; auditory or
speech-language training; and other types of therapy that may improve
speech, communication, listening skills, eye contact, comprehension,
and emotional responsiveness
The interventions offered are based on what the school system thinks the
individual family needs.
240
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

In general, autism specialists agree that the sooner a child gets some kind of
therapy, the more progress he or she can make.
The National Research Council, a federal task force, recommends that chil-
dren be put into an early intervention program immediately after diagnosis.
For best results, preschool children should have intensive programming for
at least 25 hours weekly. The 25 hours includes parental programming as well
as professional programming. And teachers should work with no more than
two children at a time, and parental training should be available.
Specifying Special: Entering 
the Public School System
When a child who may need special services enters the public school system
at the age of 3 (the recommend age for such a step; see the section “Acting
Early with an Individualized Family Service Plan [IFSP]”), a process begins
that involves several steps. Your child has to receive an evaluation to estab-
lish his or her eligibility, and you have to undergo the process of implement-
ing an Individualized Education Program (IEP). We show you the ropes in the
pages that follow.
Always keep a paper trail, even if you don’t foresee any problems. Write let-
ters, tape record meetings, and keep up-to-date files. You also have the right
to inspect and review all your child’s educational records, according to the
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). The schools must keep
records for a minimum of five years.
Some parents, on the other hand, may choose to take on a greater financial
burden to avoid the “autism” label. See Chapter 2 if your child doesn’t fit the
criteria for autism but has similar difficulties.
Initiating an evaluation 
to establish eligibility
A child with special-services needs has to receive a special-education evalua-
tion upon entering the public school system. The parents or the school dis-
trict itself can initiate the evaluation, but parents must consent to it. If they
disagree with the results of an evaluation, parents can legally take their child
to an outside professional for an Independent Educational Evaluation (IEE),
with the school district picking up the tab in some cases.
241
Chapter 12: Legally Speaking: Making the Most of Your Child’s Education

Only doctors and other qualified persons, not teachers, may diagnose
autism. Schools are there to help with screening and referrals. For example,
school psychologists can identify a child with autism for purposes of provid-
ing special services within the school setting. This label alone may or (more
usually) may not qualify an individual for community-based special services
outside the school setting (for example, Medicaid, SSI, and SSDI, which we
discuss in Chapter 16). Also, if a child is diagnosed with autism outside the
school setting, the school is required to evaluate to determine which services
are required by that individual child, not to provide a blanket set of services
that the child might not even need.
During the special-education evaluation, a team of specialists from different
fields — usually called something like a multi-disciplinary team or a child-study
team — assesses the child and decides, with parental input, if he’s consid-
ered disabled under federal law. If he is, the team will decide whether his dis-
ability “adversely affects his educational performance” according to the
statute, which makes him eligible for special-education services. (Again, par-
ents may disagree and ask for a hearing with the state in order to appeal the
school’s decision.)
The evaluation will take into account the child’s social and academic history,
and the team will normally interview the parents to find out if there were any
birth problems or prior educational issues. This is called a social history.
According to law, the district may not use any one single measure to deter-
mine the child’s eligibility, but must consider a range of factors, using com-
monly accepted assessment tools and strategies, and including parental
input, to assess cognitive and behavioral factors, and the physical and devel-
opmental history of the child. Parents can help by providing accurate infor-
mation on what the child knows and can do (a functional assessment).
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, a reference published by the American
Psychiatric Association, classifies autistic disorder as having 6 or more symp-
toms from a list of 12 possible symptoms. The manual groups the symptoms
into three areas: social interaction, communication, and behavior (Chapter 1
gives you the full lists). Because the law defines autism more broadly than
the DSM does, some children with developmental disorders who wouldn’t be
diagnosed with autism under the DSM guidelines (for instance, if the kids
don’t have symptoms from all three groups) are classified as autistic so they
can receive needed services.
Although this practice is often attacked as “diagnosis for services,” support-
ers point out that it’s only fair to help all children with disabilities, and that
the criteria for developmental disabilities are in flux. In some states, children
classified as developmentally disabled may not receive the services that chil-
dren diagnosed with autism receive, although these children may need just
as much help.
242
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

Implementing an Individualized 
Education Program (IEP)
The IEP is a very important process that you’ll be taking part in for as long as
your child is in special education. In this section, we take you through the
steps, including forming an IEP team, developing a plan, and dealing with any
problems that may come up along the way.
First things first, make sure the school’s IEP process is up to speed. Here are
some red flags to look out for:
 The school is rushing the process. It shouldn’t take more than 90 days
in most states, but it shouldn’t take 2 weeks, either. The process needs
to be thorough, which takes time. Did the school give you enough time
to arrange to be at the initial meeting, and did it provide a time and
place that worked well for you?
 Poor communication. Are any officials reluctant to explain situations to
you or dismissive of your role? Are letters and memos about the child for-
warded to you? The school should inform you of the time, location, partic-
ipants, and the purpose for each IEP meeting, and it should allow you to
bring your own expert(s) or friend(s) for moral support, if you desire.
Bringing a trusted friend, even if the person isn’t an expert, to an IEP
meeting can help parents maintain a little objectivity.
 The process isn’t open. You’re legally entitled to attend every team
meeting. You should also visit, observe classes, and talk to teachers. The
law, don’t forget, stresses parental involvement. You should also receive
from the school a copy of your legal rights during the process.
Parents have the right to have the meeting at a time and place they can
attend. Being a no-show, however, reduces the school’s willingness to
accommodate those who are unable to meet during school hours.
Forming an IEP team
An IEP team conducts testing and classroom observations, meets with the
child’s parents or guardians, reviews data, and ultimately issues a report of
recommendations. The school primarily forms the IEP team, and the team
has, by federal law, a maximum of 60 days from when it receives parental con-
sent for the evaluation to meet to begin developing the IEP.
Normally, IEP teams feature at least three occupations in addition to the par-
ents. Examples of possible members include the following:
 Social worker
 Educational psychologist
 Special education teacher
243
Chapter 12: Legally Speaking: Making the Most of Your Child’s Education

 Speech or language pathologist
 Classroom teacher (if the student will be in regular classes)
 School administrator
 Occupational or physical therapist
 The child receiving services (see the sidebar “Involving your child 
in the IEP”)
Of course, the makeup of the team isn’t as casual as it may seem because of
the possibilities. Here are some rules to consider:
 At least one classroom teacher must attend each meeting, unless the
teacher submits a written report explaining why he or she should be
excused (you need to consent to this).
 The parents and the child must attend each meeting, if the child is old
enough and capable of participating (see the “Involving your child in the
IEP” sidebar in this chapter).
 The team must include a representative of the school system.
 The team must include someone to interpret the evaluation results (see
the section “Evaluating the IEP”).
 The team must include, if applicable, a representative from the agency
providing transition services to college or employment for your child
when she graduates.
One person can fill multiple roles. Parents are also entitled to bring any
person who has special knowledge about their child’s disability, such as an
advocate, specialist, or even a family friend. And parents who need a foreign
language or sign language interpreter are entitled to request one.
Developing the IEP
The IEP isn’t just a formality or mindless paperwork you need to get out of
the way; it has a major role in a child’s educational future. Not to overdrama-
tize, but to you and the school, the IEP is what the Ten Commandments were
to Moses, only with much more detail and, hopefully, written in a language
you can understand.
The operative word in Individualized Education Program is individualized.
Although each state (or even each school system) has its own forms for for-
matting the IEP document, the state should tailor the content of the document
to each child’s strengths and weaknesses; it shouldn’t be standardized. You
won’t find a typical autistic child, so you shouldn’t have typical IEPs. Every
disabled child is unique, which the U.S. Department of Education acknowl-
edges as the reason for developing a separate program for each student.
However, if the federal government is involved, you know that complete cre-
ative control is a thing of imagination. Some sections of the program are
mandatory under federal law including:
244
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

 The child’s “present level of academic achievement and functional per-
formance” (in other words, how the child is performing in school now).
 Measurable annual goals, such as meeting state educational standards
or other benchmarks.
 How progress toward annual goals will be measured and how often par-
ents will hear of progress.
 Special education and related services to be provided, including extra
help the child will get and professional training for educators to teach.
Federal law lists the related services in the following list as applicable to
some children but not necessarily all. You don’t get to choose whatever
services look good. You and the school have to prove they fit the child’s
needs.
245
Chapter 12: Legally Speaking: Making the Most of Your Child’s Education
• Audiology services
• Counseling services
• Early identification 
and assessment of 
disabilities
• Medical services
• Occupational therapy
• Orientation and mobility
services
• Parent counseling and training
• Physical therapy
• Recreation
• Rehabilitation counseling services
• School health services
• Social-work services
• Speech-language pathology services
• Transportation
 How much participation the child will have with regular classes and
normal school activities.
 Which achievement tests the child can take, which the school will modify
according to his or her needs, and how the school will modify the tests.
Some states’ standardized achievement tests preclude modifications.
For example, some achievement tests include a Reading Comprehension
section. Because the creators of the test designed that section to be a
comprehension of reading, a school official can’t read that section to the
individual taking the test. Such action would be considered “auditory
comprehension.”
 How often services will be provided after they begin, where they will
take place, and for how long.
 For older children, anticipated transition services (beginning no later
than age 14) for when they leave school.
Beyond these requirements, you should work with your child’s school to
make whatever other decisions are necessary for your child’s situation using
whatever process the school deems appropriate.

Evaluating the IEP
After you develop the IEP, you need to make sure that you’re happy with it. In
this section, we provide some guidelines for evaluating whether your IEP will
be effective.
The law lists special factors that the IEP team must give strong consideration
to, including the child’s strengths, the parents’ or guardians’ ideas for
enhancing the child’s education, the results of recent evaluations, and state-
and district-level test scores. Within these requirements, you can note the
importance of parental input to the process. Here are some key ideas:
 Don’t assume that more is better where services are concerned.
Sometimes less is more, because some children are easily overstimu-
lated. Use resources judiciously where you think they can make the
biggest difference.
 Focus on developing strengths as well as remediating weaknesses. If
the child has an interest in something, build on that interest. (You can
find more on this topic in Chapter 10.)
 Try to remain objective and rely on your common sense. This tip is
important. It’s hard not to react emotionally if you feel professionals 
are misunderstanding or misdiagnosing your child, but try to hear
people out before you reject their opinions. At that point, start your
homework — research. Get a second opinion or evaluation.
 Focus on your child’s specific issues and how to help him reach his
potential rather than diagnostic labels. Unless you feel a label is hurt-
ing your child’s opportunity to receive the kind of help she needs, you
need to focus on remediating her difficulties instead of wasting tons of
energy over whether to call it autism, Asperger’s, or PDD.
246
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 
Involving your child in the IEP
You may want to consider involving your child in
the development of his own IEP as appropriate
to his ability. (A book edited by Stephen Shore,
Ask and Tell: Self-Advocacy and Disclosure for
People on the Autism Spectrum (Autism
Asperger Publishing Company), has more ideas
for child involvement.) The Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) encourages
the involvement of the child (and mandates it by
the age of 14). Why is this? Because the more a
child becomes involved in the development of
his own education, the more success he will
experience in advocating for his needs later in
life. A nonverbal, hyperactive child may be able
to interact with a few of the IEP team members
for a couple minutes at the beginning of a meet-
ing. Another child may be able to state what’s
difficult or easy in a class. Yet another child may
be able to suggest accommodations and even
lead parts of the IEP meeting under the watch-
ful eye of the team leader. The possibilities for
participation abound.

When judging the IEP, look carefully at three parts:
 The goals: What the child should be able to do and when
 The accommodations: What the school will do to help the child reach
those goals
 The placement: How your child will divide his or her time among regular
and/or special-education classrooms (which is very important to the
provision of accommodations)
The goals should be measurable and specific, and the accommodations —
intended to ensure access to education — should match the goals. The
child’s placement is also a factor to which you want to give strong considera-
tion. You should limit the goals to an annual cycle. Because the child doesn’t
have to meet short-term objectives (except for students who take alternative
assessments), these goals are highly important. The more specific, the better.
Check out Table 12-1 for good and bad examples of goals to include in the IEP.
Table 12-1
Sample Goals for an IEP
The Good
Over the course of the year, the student will demonstrate mastery of
geometric shapes, as indicated by a score at the 75th percentile on
the Georgia Inventory of Geometric Proficiency. (Note: No such test
exists, but you get the idea that you should have a way to measure
progress — not necessarily a test, but a benchmark.)
The Bad
By the second semester, the student will interact successfully with
his peers. (What does it mean to “interact successfully”? How can
success be determined and by whom? How can you measure it?)
The Ugly
The student will improve his mathematics skills and his attitude
toward the subject. (By when will this happen? Which skills should
the student concentrate on, exactly? How much should the skills
improve? Will he know algebra or just his times tables? How will
you measure his “attitude”?)
If the accommodations don’t seem adequate to reach the goals, you need to
ask why. For example, what good is a goal to double the child’s spoken
vocabulary by the end of the year if caregivers don’t provide speech-lan-
guage therapy to help meet that goal? Likewise, what good is having modifi-
cations, such as alternative assessments, but no goals to strive for? You don’t
want to be stuck holding a map without a destination. Make sure your IEP
includes where the child is now, where she or he is going, and how he or she
can get there.
247
Chapter 12: Legally Speaking: Making the Most of Your Child’s Education

The placement is where members of the IEP team carry out the program.
Locations may include a regular classroom, a special-education classroom, or
some combination of both. Placements should be in the least restrictive envi-
ronment, by which the law dictates that the disabled child be included as
much as possible with non-disabled children. The school should remove the
child from the regular classroom only if he can’t get the education he needs
with supplemental aid and modifications.
Appealing if you’re not satisfied with the IEP
The IEP team usually presents the IEP to parents during a team meeting, to
which parents should always be invited. (Sometimes the meeting is held over
videoconference or conference call.) If you would like additional time outside
of the meeting to review the IEP (perhaps study it closely or ask other people
to review it), you can ask to take it home. But be sure to make the whole team
aware of your request because in many states the school will consider your
not objecting to the terms at the meeting to be consent to go ahead and
implement the IEP. Procedures vary around the country, but generally, if you
don’t actively object to the IEP, the school will begin providing services. If
you’re satisfied with the IEP, you can continue to the next section — if not,
keep reading!
If you disagree with any part of the IEP, you don’t have to consent to it. Make
your concerns known either during the meeting or as soon as possible after-
ward and ask for changes. For example, if you don’t agree with points in the
IEP, such as the goals or the child’s placement, you should first discuss your
concerns with the IEP team and try to work out an agreement amicably. You
don’t have to take “no” for an answer. You can request more testing, an inde-
pendent evaluation of the child, or mediation of the dispute. Mediation is a
voluntary procedure, conducted by a trained, impartial mediator, for resolv-
ing a dispute between you and the school. (For more on disagreeing with the
IEP team, see the sidebar “‘How to disagree with the IEP team without start-
ing World War III’”.)
If mediation fails, you’re entitled to a due-process hearing. The due-process
hearing occurs before a hearing officer or an administrative law judge. To get
a hearing, you must have a failed mediation proceeding, and you need to file
a complaint by writing a letter directly to your state’s education agency (this
information is available from your school district), specifying which part of
the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) you believe has been
violated. The agency must resolve the complaint within 60 calendar days. An
extension of that time limit is permitted only if exceptional circumstances
exist with respect to the complaint. You can file a complaint on your own or
by using an attorney. There are attorneys that specialize in special education
law — try to find one of those or at least someone who is familiar with the
process.
248
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

For instance, you may explain that your child isn’t receiving the services stip-
ulated in the IEP. The state has 60 days to resolve the complaint. The party
requesting the hearing has the burden of proof. If the parent initiates the
hearing, then the parent must prove that the school is not doing what is
required to provide a “free appropriate public education.” In some cases, the
school district may request the hearing. The child’s school should also pro-
vide information on low-cost legal or educational services you may need.
249
Chapter 12: Legally Speaking: Making the Most of Your Child’s Education
“How to disagree with the IEP team 
without starting World War III”
(Excerpted with permission from www.
Wrightslaw.com, a Web site hosted by
Peter and Pamela Wright, authors and experts
on special education law.)
If you are presented with an IEP that is not
appropriate for your child, you should advise the
IEP team that you don’t think the IEP is appro-
priate, and that it does not provide your child
with enough help or the right kind of help. You
should use facts to support your position (for
example, facts from an evaluation of your child
from a private sector evaluator or graphs of
your child’s test scores). Be polite but firm.
When the team asks you to sign consent to the
IEP, write this statement on the IEP: “I consent
to this IEP being implemented but I object to it
for the reasons stated during the meeting.” Sign
your name.
Someone may get upset and claim you’re not
allowed to write on the IEP because it is a legal
document. This is not true — you can write on
your child’s IEP.
You are a member of the team and a participant
in the IEP process. The law requires you to
make your objections clear. The IEP is the best
document to use for this purpose. If someone
tries to stop you, continue to write. If someone
yanks the document away from you, continue to
write as the IEP tears.
Stay calm. Take your copy of the IEP (whatever
is left), stand, and say “Thank you. I guess this
meeting is over.” Extend your hand to shake
theirs. Pick up your tape recorder and leave. (If
you expect a dispute, you should tape record
the meeting, openly.)
The IEP team now has a problem. You have
advised (the team) in writing that its proposed
program is not appropriate for your child. You
also consented to implementing the program, so
they should implement it.
Afterward, write a nice thank you letter to the
head of the IEP team. Re-state your position:
You consented to the school implementing 
the IEP because you believe an inadequate 
program is better than no program. However,
you believe the proposed program is not 
appropriate.
You should assume that:
 A hearing will be necessary to resolve a
problem.
 All school staff will testify against you.
 Staff’s recollection of the facts will be com-
pletely different from yours.
 You cannot testify!
If you cannot testify, how can you tell your
story? You tell your story with the tape, tran-
script of the meeting, your letter, and the IEP.

The due-process hearing is similar to a courtroom trial. You (or your lawyer if
you hire one) can present evidence, have witnesses you choose attend the
proceedings, and question and cross-examine all witnesses present.
The school must show you all evidence that it plans to present at least five
working days before the hearing, and if it fails to comply, the school can’t pre-
sent it. Unlike on television, you have no surprise witnesses or evidence to
worry about.
You may appeal a negative decision from the hearing officer to a reviewing
officer, and if that fails, you can appeal once again to a higher court such as a
U.S. District Court.
If you win your case, the school system is typically required to reimburse you
for your legal fees and expenses. If you lose, or if the school offers to settle
ten days before and the settlement offer is similar to what the hearing officer
decides, you’re on your own. You have to weigh the pros and cons of taking
on this responsibility should you lose your case.
Whatever the outcome, you can get a transcript of the hearing. Keep a paper
trail. Legal eagles like Peter Wright advise that keeping up-to-date and
detailed records can be an invaluable tool for future planning or advocacy.
Assessing Your Child’s Progress
You’ve just signed the IEP agreed upon by the entire IEP team. You walk out
of the meeting with a copy of the document and knowledge that all the teach-
ers and other professionals working with your child have access to that doc-
ument and know their specific responsibilities under it.
Your focus should now turn to monitoring the progress being made toward
the year-end goals of the IEP. The entire IEP team should review the IEP annu-
ally and revise it if necessary. For updates, you can contact the school and
ask somebody you trust on the team what’s happening. If the IEP is well-
designed, you’ll know what questions to ask! (See the previous section for
more on developing and evaluating the IEP.)
Congress has approved a three-year IEP that may save you and the school
some paperwork, but this plan is probably not a good idea for your child (or
anyone else’s!). None of the states as of this writing have actually initiated a
three-year IEP. A great deal can happen in three years in a child’s life. If you’re
asked to consent to it, just say no.
You can also have more than one IEP meeting a year, if necessary. More fre-
quent reviews are called for if the child makes so much progress that she no
longer needs services. Legally, you or your child’s teachers can request addi-
tional meetings if, for example, any of the following apply:
250
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

 Observation of a lack of expected progress toward IEP goals
 New information that parents may have becomes available
For example, your physician may have new findings to report about your
child’s diagnosis, or sudden changes in your child’s home environment
can create stress that may impact school behaviors.
 The results of any reevaluation necessitate an alteration
 The child’s anticipated needs begin to change
Above all, strong and ongoing communication and cordial working relation-
ships with school officials and employees will make your life easier.
Flexing Your Educational Rights 
When You Need To
You want to develop trusting relationships with teachers and other educa-
tional professionals who can help you and your child. Sometimes, however,
you may feel strongly that your child isn’t receiving what he needs and is
entitled to in the legal sense. In that case, you shouldn’t just roll over and
agree with everything you’re told.
If you’re displeased with the situation in your school and have tried to resolve
it peacefully to no avail, you must take a stand. (For an example of this, see
the sidebar “Disagreeing with the IEP team without starting World War III”.)
Your school or even your district may not have adequate services if your
area doesn’t have very many special-needs students. This inadequacy occurs
because when the number of special education children in a given district
goes up, so does the funding from the state and, thus, the services provided.
For this reason, many people with special-needs children move to districts
with large populations of special-needs kids, which in turn expands the pro-
grams in those districts and attracts more students.
Some of these options require financial outlay, whether for legal services or
for educational services not provided by the school. For this reason, be sure
that you are willing to pay for them before you reject the school’s services.
 Working within the system by requesting mediation or a due-process
hearing to get more services. Mediation is having a disinterested, trained
mediator attempt to resolve your dispute. A due-process hearing is
when you go before a judge or hearing officer to get a resolution to your
complaint that your child’s rights under IDEA have been violated.
The losing party of the due-process hearing pays for the cost of the
hearing. Mediation must take place before you can get a due-process
hearing, which you should do only if all other resolution methods fail.
251
Chapter 12: Legally Speaking: Making the Most of Your Child’s Education

 Moving your child to another school or district that has more services,
either for part of the day or full time.
 Enrolling your child in private school, or arranging other outside ser-
vices, such as a home-based program, which the school may pick up
under some circumstances.
If you can show that your child isn’t receiving appropriate services from
the school, you may be entitled to reimbursement for private services. It
is the parents’ responsibility to prove that the school is not doing what
is necessary. It is not the school’s responsibility to prove that what it is
doing is correct.
You must give the district a heads up before you pull your child from the
school because of inadequate services either at an IEP meeting or by letter
ten days before you remove the child. If you don’t, you won’t be eligible for
reimbursement. Home-based programs can add up if you pay for profession-
als, but you can conduct them a bit more cheaply if you can train people
yourself to work with your child. (One way to find potential helpers is by
putting up signs in local college or university departments of education, spe-
cial education, and psychology.) In addition to the financial strain, if you try
to run a program all by yourself, you can quickly burn out.

“We don’t owe you a Cadillac”
Before he was 5, Daniel had spent two years in
full-time behavioral therapy, setting his parents
back about $33,000 per year. His parents jokingly
referred to the money as “Daniel’s Harvard edu-
cation.” When Mark, Daniel’s father, went to the
school district to talk about his son starting
kindergarten in the public school, he — like any
parent — wanted the best for Daniel, including
everything the experts had recommended.
After hearing Mark out, the school psycholo-
gist responded apologetically that the district
couldn’t afford “the works” for every kid. “Look,
our budget’s on a shoestring. We care about
helping Daniel, too, but we’re required to prove
that he’s making measurable progress, not that
he’s reaching his full potential, as you’re asking.
We owe you a car, but you want a Cadillac. We
don’t owe you a Cadillac.”
Mark says he knows the school’s money is tight,
but this is his child they’re talking about. “We’re
going to put him in public school during the day,
and supplement that with private behavioral
therapy in the afternoons and on the weekends.
It’s a compromise, but we can’t afford a Cadillac
either.”
Sadly, although educational services for autistic
children are more necessary than any car, very
few school systems can provide all the neces-
sities at the level parents need. School systems
are federally mandated to provide a free and
appropriate public education (FAPE) — not one
of maximal benefit. Be prepared to lobby the
district for more services while shelling out
more of your own resources to get your child
the right services.

 Helping your non-autistic child cope and thrive
 Prompting your autistic child to form friendships
F
orming and maintaining social relationships are some of the toughest chal-
lenges faced by people with autism and those closest to them, because
relationships depend upon effective communication. People with autism have
trouble communicating with and understanding others, which can cause fre-
quent misunderstandings with their non-autistic peers and siblings, which can
lead to isolation and frustration for them. The unfortunate chain of events is
very painful for parents and loved ones to watch and deal with.
The problem isn’t that autistic children are antisocial or don’t care about
others. Your child may face sensory processing issues (see Chapter 10) or
other challenges that make it difficult to keep up in conversation. Even chil-
dren with Asperger’s (discussed in Chapter 5), with excellent language skills,
may misunderstand social cues and unwittingly come off as arrogant or self-
centered because of their chattering. More likely, your child wants to connect
but doesn’t know how.
Autistic children aren’t all that different from neurotypical kids when it
comes to communication; they just need much more help and understanding.
Their problems are more severe and require more patience. The worst thing
a loved one can do is to give up helping the child to communicate. The best
course of action is to go with gentle persistence. (For other tips on bridging
the communication gap, check out Chapter 10.)
In this chapter, we help you recognize the social challenges your child faces,
show you how to include the whole family to open up the lines of communi-
cation, and give you tips to help your child build and maintain relationships
outside the family. Note: People with autism are all different, and they need
individualized strategies to help them succeed with relationships. Take what
you discover in this chapter and tailor it to your loved one to see what works
best. (We deal with children here; you can find more information on adult
relationships in Part IV.)

Recognizing the Social Challenges 
an Autistic Child Faces
You may observe a range of social behaviors on the autism spectrum. Some
children with autism may be withdrawn and avoid other people completely;
others may respond if people approach them first. Some children may even
seem overeager to approach others, and in their excitement, they do so inap-
propriately. Children with the latter tendency may have good language skills
and the desire to connect with others, but their lack of social understanding
trips them up. In the following pages, we let you in on the myriad challenges
autistic children face and how you can recognize the needs of your loved one.
Children with autism need simplicity to function at their best, which means
you need to limit their social interactions to levels they feel comfortable with.
You also need to realize that being social is much more tiring when you have
to work harder to understand others. Autistic kids need rest after social inter-
action; don’t try to force them to interact like typical children. Be sensitive to
behavior that may indicate that he’s had enough for the day. Tantrums and
irritability, as with all children, can be signs of exhaustion.
Understanding social norms
Autistic people have trouble understanding social norms, which are unwritten
behaviors that most children pick up naturally. Even mildly autistic people
report a lifelong trouble with social norms. Often, when a typical child breaks
a social rule, he or she knows better. The parent needs to remind the child,
but then he will be aware of the rules he’s breaking. People with autism, how-
ever, don’t pick up social rules in the natural course of events.
Here are some social blunders autistic people may commit unwittingly:
 Blurting out embarrassing truths (you smell funny!)
 Talking about themselves without pausing to let other people talk
 Delivering one-sided monologues about their passions
 Taking things literally when a joke is being told
So, how can you help your loved one interact in social settings without
offending anyone? With coaching, support, and understanding. In the begin-
ning, you may have to teach by rote what seems to come instinctually for
other children. The autistic child needs to learn with formal rules and rituals.
For example, they need to practice social interactions by using techniques
such as social stories (explained in this chapter). The process may feel
strange and unnatural, but it works. Riding a bike probably seemed strange
and unnatural the first time you tried it, too.
254
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

The instruction should also include how to read an environment. Different
environments have different sets of behavioral expectations. The way one
behaves at school is different than the way one behaves at a basketball game,
which is different from the way one behaves at a formal banquet.
Without advance warning and coaching, many people with autism would
have difficulty identifying, let’s say, what behavior would be appropriate if a
banquet was set up in a gymnasium in which they had previously played bas-
ketball. This type of behavior is not only related to being unable to pick up
social cues, but to the need for structure and order. See Chapter 11 for more
on the importance of structure and routine to autistic people.
It may seem like your child will never interact spontaneously and naturally in
the beginning, but with practice and time, all the situations you practice will be
likely to come more naturally to the child as she integrates social behaviors
into her repertoire. But if a child is severely autistic, that may never happen.
People learn social skills, like any other set of skills; just because your child
needs more support and may take longer doesn’t mean she’s incapable of
learning and progressing. Most autistic children are capable of progress.
When your child is young, you may want to videotape her in social situations
just to have a benchmark of progress in this area. You may be very pleasantly
surprised later when you watch the tape. Also, you can get the process
moving by having all family members encouraging the child and rewarding
her with lavish praise for any communication attempts she makes.
Conversing and cooperating
Unless your family lives on a desert island (in which case you have other
problems to worry about), you have to deal with other humans, and every
child, regardless of his or her level of functioning, needs to communicate and
cooperate with others. But just because a person can talk doesn’t mean he or
she can communicate. And just because someone can’t talk, doesn’t mean
that they can’t communicate.
A person on the autism spectrum might be able to speak very well and say
what might be expected in a conversation, but that person still misses many
vocal and body language cues unless she has been taught. Very good expres-
sive communication skills can mask poor receptive communication and poor
social skills. These terms are explained in the next section.
Communication barriers
Two of the communication terms you may hear from teachers or other pro-
fessionals are receptive language and expressive language. Receptive refers to
the ability to understand communication directed at you, whereas expressive
concerns the ability to make others understand what you’re communicating.
255
Chapter 13: Fostering Healthy Relationships

Autistic children don’t often initiate conversations, but they do respond to
others’ initiations. In other words, their receptive language is stronger than
their expressive language. However, given time and with help from behavioral
programs, therapists, and immediate family members, autistic children can
develop expressive language so they don’t just repeat words back (known as
echolalia) — they use language to express themselves.
For example, in the Miller Method, parents can narrate a child’s actions, like
an excited sportscaster might, to help them attach their activities to their
words. See Chapters 9 and 10 for more language development tips.
Asperger communication
High-functioning people or folks with Asperger’s face a cruel dilemma: The
better they are at adjusting to school and work, the more social stigma they
face when they inevitably run up against their biggest weaknesses — namely,
not knowing what to do in social situations, even if the environment is the
same. (For info on helping low-functioning people, see the following section.)
Autistic people can mistakenly assume that what they say makes sense to
other people or that it’s relevant, when neither may be true. The people on
the other end of the conversations may be completely confused because they
miss what the affected people think is obvious. Sometimes a person with
Asperger’s will try so hard to be understood by throwing out lots of words
(what’s called doing an information dump), that it will come across as aggres-
sive or arrogant. In reality, the person is struggling to get the words out and
make herself clear. She may give a lot of unnecessary detail to try to explain
something that the other person doesn’t seem to be getting.
As adults, autistic people may face rejection and the sad fact that few people
are willing to take the time to help them understand how they may be mis-
reading situations. At work, an affected person may have a hygiene problem,
for example. Coworkers will avoid her, and she won’t know why because
nobody will say anything to her.
Many professionals working with high-functioning people with autism may
forget about this disconnect between language and social skills and fail to
address the social skill deficits. Autistic individuals need help while they’re
still in their formative years. As children, they need to be supported and
coached by parents and professionals to take care of niceties such as personal
hygiene, for example, even if they don’t understand the need for all of them.
Supporting a child when verbal 
communication is minimal or nonexistent
A child at a more severe portion of the autism spectrum likely doesn’t know
how to cooperate and form friendships or associations with others. But make
no mistake: Like any child, he wants to feel included, too. He may just take
256
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

much longer and need a period of observing and working the communication
through in his head before he’s ready to try it himself.
For example, say you’re taking your family out on a boat. Your autistic son
may balk at wearing his lifejacket. You can solve this problem by having his
siblings and adult family members put their jackets on first while he watches
the entire process. After he observes, he may be ready to put his on in order
to feel included. The child needs the extra time to fit in, as well as to under-
stand what’s expected of him.
You can support your child’s social adjustment by following these tips (some
of these tips may also apply to higher functioning children):
 Get to know other parents at your child’s school (not just the parents
of the other students in the special-education class). Arrange play dates
while your children are young. Even if the children don’t seem inter-
ested, get them together. Keep them practicing their social skills in real
environments. (For more on interacting with other kids, see the section
“Encouraging Your Child to Form Friendships”.)
 Encourage your child to play with other children. Try to channel his
interest in an isolated activity into activity with another person and
broaden the scope of the activity. For example, if your child likes horses,
take him horseback riding with other children.
 After you demonstrate an activity or have your child watch other kids
do it, give him a chance to absorb it and process it before he tries the
activity himself. It may take time — a day, a week, or more — for the
information to sink in. Autistic kids like to observe new behaviors from a
safe distance; later, they may be ready to try it. Also, don’t give up on an
activity too quickly. It may take some time for a feeling of safety and
familiarity to develop, and, consequently, for enjoyment to build.
 Speak slowly and clearly, and wait a period of time before repeating
yourself. Don’t give too much information at once, and don’t assume
that if you don’t get a response, your child didn’t hear you. He may be
processing what you said, and talking to him before he processes every-
thing may cause him to need to reboot the entire thought sequence from
the beginning. If he gives no response after a long time, do talk to him,
but realize that he may have a slower processing speed. He probably
understands more than you think. Encourage and reward any communi-
cation attempts he makes with smiles and praise, not candy.
 Encourage participation in sporting activities. Team sports are hard for
autistic kids, but they can excel at individual sports such as swimming,
jumping on a trampoline, tumbling, horseback riding, and so on. If other
people are around, your child can indirectly take part with a group with-
out having to directly interact with others.
 Have your child’s teacher support interaction by prompting her to
pair children for activities or have your child tutor or be tutored by
other children. Sometimes, small groups work well; in other situations,
children need to be one on one.
257
Chapter 13: Fostering Healthy Relationships

 Don’t force eye contact. It can be very difficult for a child with sensory
processing difficulties to make consistent eye contact. (See Chapter 10
for more on sensory difficulties.)
What if your child just wants to play video games or stim out (see Chapter 10)?
Don’t let your child — even a child with sensory issues — tune out the world
entirely. Be sensitive to sensory issues that may make some interactions that
involve touching, loud noises, or flashing lights painful, but don’t isolate your
child. She needs to be around people for at least some of the day.
All in the Family
An autistic child’s needs often complicate familial relationships, especially
with siblings (never easy relationships in the first place). For example, sib-
lings want a playmate, but the child with autism may not be inclined to play
amicably with his or her sibling, or anyone else for that matter. This refusal
causes frustration and confusion for the sibling, who, especially when very
young, struggles to understand why her brother can’t be “like other kids.”
You can help your family by informing your kids about autism and the com-
plications it introduces, understanding the challenges siblings face and help-
ing them cope, and involving members of your extended family to create a
network of help and understanding. We show you how in the next sections.

High functioning but still struggling
Kathy Grant, of Denver, is a high-functioning
autistic woman who knew all her life that she
was “different,” but she didn’t know why. Not
until her junior year in college did she find out
she’s autistic. Today, Grant is a respite provider,
working part-time for a family who has a young
adult with autism. She received her political sci-
ence degree from Maryville College in 1987.
However, despite overcoming many obstacles,
Kathy remembers having social struggles most
of her life.
“As a child and teenager, I didn’t have the skill
of being interested in what other people were
interested in and only talked about the stuff I
was interested in. There were times at the
dinner table, when the family would talk about
things such as houses and real estate and I’d
say “Lima, Peru!” or talk about Iranians, the
hostages, and Ayatollah Khomeini while my
Mom talked about getting Grandma a Christmas
present. What I needed to be taught was how
to listen and enter into conversation step by
step, with patience and love.” (Excerpted with
permission from Social Skills — My View, an
essay published in the Autism Society of
America Colorado chapter’s quarterly publica-
tion [1st quarter, 2003].)

Talking about autism with your kids
How do you explain autism to your non-autistic children and to your autistic
child? For the siblings, different levels of disclosure work at different ages:
 You can talk about the disorder when kids are young without calling it
autism. For example, you can say, “We have to help your brother
because he’s different.” You don’t need to go into great detail in the
beginning. Siblings are aware that something is different, especially
when their brother is screaming or projectile vomiting.
 When kids get older, and for adults you want to bring in to your circle of
trust, you can use the four-step method described later in this section.
You don’t have to make up explanations for situations and behaviors you
don’t understand. Children will always ask “why,” and sometimes you have
no good answer. You can change the subject or, better yet, simply say, “We
don’t know yet.”
Your child with autism needs to feel that his differences are okay. He isn’t
flawed, defective, or lacking any humanity. His brain is simply wired differ-
ently, and he has abilities that others may not share. He needs to hear that
he’s neither superior nor inferior — just differently abled.
I (co-author Stephen Shore) have developed a four-step method for telling
children and adults that they’re on the autism spectrum. Children and adults
almost always know on some level that they’re different from other people,
and you need to validate their feelings. The process may take as little as 10
minutes or as long as several days, weeks, or months. The following list out-
lines the steps.
I like to use the word “strength” in place of “weakness” to avoid a negative
connotation for a behavior or action where a child is experiencing difficulties.
1. Building awareness of strengths.
This step is important because self-knowledge of one’s strengths, and
later challenges, is a precursor toward building self-determination.
2. “Rack up” the child’s strengths and challenges.
In other words, develop a list. If you can write the list down, you’ll have
a record for the child to refer to. Do your best to find a strength to
accommodate for a challenge.
3. Non-judgmentally compare the child’s strengths with the strengths of
other potential role models, friends, and family members.
Comparisons will help the child realize that different people all have dif-
ferent strengths and challenges.
259
Chapter 13: Fostering Healthy Relationships

4. Introduce the label of autism or Asperger Syndrome as appropriate to
summarize the child’s condition.
Careful thinking through these four steps will increase the probability of
success.
Usually, I precede mentioning the label with a statement like “There are
scientists, educators, and others who study different characteristics of
people. It so happens that your set of characteristics line up with what’s
called autism.” (For more on autism and its forms, see Chapter 2.)
For kids who have Asperger’s (see Chapter 5) and are undiagnosed, finding
out the truth can be a big relief. They can replace their sense of difference
and isolation with understanding and coping strategies. Knowledge lets them
know that others are like them and that their difficulties have a name. The
whole family discovers what they’re dealing with, which makes life simpler.
It’s important to note, however, that not all disclosures go well. For some,
being labeled with a “syndrome” or “disorder” can be frightening. Some chil-
dren may wonder why they’ve been labeled “different” than neurotypical
kids. If your child has these feelings, you need to comfort him and assure him
that he’s still a special individual capable of living a very fulfilling life.
Considering the challenges siblings face
Siblings learn often-difficult lessons about how to deal with difference early
on in life, and these lessons can lead to greater compassion, maturity, and
social skills as adults. These lessons are even more important, and often
more difficult, when autism is involved. The autistic sibling may be low func-
tioning, and the other siblings have to learn to read his nonverbal signals.
With a brother or sister who has Asperger’s, siblings learn that not every-
body thinks the way they do. The following sections explain how you can
260

A successful disclosure
Once, the parents of a music student asked me
(co-author Stephen Shore) to disclose his
Asperger Syndrome to him. After 15 minutes, we
had gone through Step 4 of my process (see
“Talking about autism with your kids”) when he
blurted, “Can we get back to the music lesson?”
Weeks later, I asked his father how his son han-
dled the disclosure. The father beamed, saying,
“My son loves having Asperger Syndrome! He
spends much time online looking up information
on his condition and is educating himself.”
In fact, I didn’t tell his son anything he didn’t
know; all I did was validate his experiences and
inform him that his set of traits had a name. He’s
now empowered to find out more about his con-
dition and has already begun to access the
wealth of information available to help him.
This disclosure was a success!

help non-autistic siblings adjust to their unique brother or sister, and how to
get typical kids involved with an autistic child.
Non-autistic siblings can become overly responsible, or they may just with-
draw and become depressed. Some children overcompensate to try to make
their parents feel better or to gain attention that they may feel they’re lack-
ing, which can have a high emotional cost for the children. Don’t let this
behavior happen. Let each child know that he or she is a valuable family
member just for being himself or herself, not for any accomplishments made.
Every child needs to feel valued.
Helping brothers and sisters adjust
You have to devote quite a bit of your time and energy to your autistic child,
of course, but you can’t forget about the rest of your family. You can’t avoid
spending more time caring for the autistic child or children, of course, but
you don’t have to let the discrepancy be a source of disharmony.
Here are some general do’s and don’ts for keeping the peace:
 Consider family therapy. Siblings may feel they need a forum to voice
their concerns and negotiate.
 Structure play and interactions between the siblings. Help them play
together by instructing the autistic child what he or she should do in a
play situation. Model the behavior, or talk him or her through it. Pick
structured games and activities that everyone can enjoy.
 Be fair. It may seem to siblings that a double standard applies — that
you have a different set of rules for each child in the household. This
may be true, but with good reason. You must explain this with honesty.
Your children’s special sibling has special needs and sometimes breaks
rules unknowingly, which isn’t willful misbehavior. Fairness means pro-
viding for each person’s needs rather than treating everybody the same.
 Be open and communicate. Your neurotypical children may need to vent
from time to time about the stresses they feel in a family with autism.
Autism can be tough for your other kids, too, and it’s normal that they
may feel resentful or envious of all the attention the autistic sibling
receives. Make it clear that having such feelings is okay, but hurting or
mistreating the sibling isn’t. Also let the siblings know that they can be
proud of their brother or sister with autism.
 Don’t protect the siblings and other family members from your emotions
or the truth about what’s happening with the autistic child. Children
usually figure things out anyway, and it’s better they hear it from you. If
you don’t openly communicate, they may think the disorder is conta-
gious or that it’s their fault.
 Help siblings take pride in the achievements of the autistic sibling. At
times, they may be embarrassed or ashamed of having a “special” sister
or brother — this is normal behavior, especially for teenagers. Help
261
Chapter 13: Fostering Healthy Relationships

them to view the sibling in a positive light, and try to model patience
and tolerance for them.
 Allow the siblings to set their own boundaries. They don’t have to accept
being hit or called names, having toys taken or broken, or having their
space invaded. They maintain these rights, even with an autistic sibling.
Most amusement parks will give you a special pass that signifies you
don’t have to stand in line. All the kids will like that!
 Take siblings out for a meal or other special activity separately to make
them feel special, too. They need to be the center of attention sometimes.
 Make life fun, and be a family. Turn activities into games, and don’t
ignore your autistic child, which can hurt. Give plenty of strokes and
positive reinforcement to everyone. Also, don’t try to do too much.
Taking four kids and a child with autism, who isn’t ready for crowds, to a
baseball game, for example, is probably too much.
Some pieces of advice apply to younger siblings or older siblings exclusively.
Follow these guidelines as closely as possible with respect to your situation:
 If you have young children, give them small bits of factual information
when they’re ready. Tailor the information to their age level, and don’t
expect them to understand autism itself — focus on observable behav-
iors and symptoms.
 Don’t let older siblings become extra parents for the autistic child.
Although you appreciate their help at times, and you must inform them
of the dangers that their sibling can get into, you don’t want to give them
extra responsibilities. They need to be able to be children, and too much
responsibility can get in the way of that. They may try to take emotional
or financial responsibility from you. Let them know this isn’t their job.
Some siblings of disabled individuals feel they have to curtail their own
dreams for the sake of the sibling; make it clear that you don’t want this.
Siblings can become very upset about screaming or other behavior. They may
resent being out in public when your autistic child causes a scene. Parents
need to limit scenes the best way they can. Some ways to calm the autistic
child include hand-held games, blankets, and weighted stuffed animals.
Getting siblings involved
Children find it difficult to be in a family where one person gets so much
attention. The term “sibling rivalry” can take on new meaning if the sibling
feels her autistic brother or sister gets all her parents’ care and time. You can
ease the pain of your non-autistic children by involving them in family activi-
ties and responsibilities and by making sure they have as much information
about autism and autistic behavior as possible.
262
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

The following list gives you some ideas on how you can educate your chil-
dren and how siblings can help:
 Make sure your kids know that life is harder in many ways for the autis-
tic sister. Everyone should accept her the way she is. She may change,
but maybe not in all the ways that the siblings want.
 Encourage the siblings to advocate for autistic people outside their
home. Some kids can — only if they’re comfortable, though — act as
ambassadors for special-needs kids by giving talks to other classes at
school or by informally explaining to their peers what autism means.
 Find activities that your autistic child and his siblings can enjoy together.
 Encourage siblings to allow their autistic sibling to take the role that he’s
good at. If he’s a good navigator, for example, family members can let
him call the shots so he feels competent, too.
 Let your kids know that just because their autistic sibling doesn’t initiate
contact, doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to play with them. Encourage
them to get play started in a simple way. The child with autism may not
respond right away, but that’s okay. Encourage your kids to be patient
and keep trying.
Your non-autistic kids can attend support-group meetings for siblings. The
Autism Society of America (www.autism-society.org) or other autism
support organizations have information about such meetings.
Including extended family
Not all extended family members need to know about the autism in the
family. If they don’t have much contact with your family, or if you don’t think
they’ll be able to understand the condition or be supportive, it may be better
not to tell them at all.
Your extended family can be helpful to the extent that they understand and
accept the diagnosis of autism. Some families are competitive, and may not
be supportive. Grandparents, aunts, or uncles may not accept your rules and
may even try to undermine you by offering forbidden foods or “discipline” to
the autistic child.
The autism diagnosis is a need to know situation. If you think the diagnosis
significantly impacts the relationship your child and your family has with the
extended family member, you need to disclose the condition.
If you decide on disclosure, start by talking about certain characteristics that
the child has that may have attracted your attention. It may not be necessary
to label the situation. You can say something like, “Johnny has trouble com-
municating or doesn’t do well with crowds,” without using the term “autism,”
if you think it will cause distress or confusion. Use your judgment.
263
Chapter 13: Fostering Healthy Relationships

Request that your relatives be sensitive to the child’s individual needs, what-
ever they may be. For example, he may not wish to eat everything on his
plate, or he may need to spend some time alone after being with the group.
Family members shouldn’t criticize or ridicule him for doing so.
Make your ground rules clear, even if extended family members don’t agree with
what you’re doing. If anybody refuses to respect your judgment, you don’t have
to feel badly about limiting contact to holidays or when you can be around to
supervise. You don’t have to sacrifice your child for the rest of your family.
Encouraging Your Child 
to Form Friendships
You may think that your autistic child is uninterested in making friends. The
more likely case is that he’s eager to make friends, but his lack of social skills
makes him the butt of jokes or teasing. With Asperger Syndrome particularly,

Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 
“He’s really sweet when he smiles” — 
A sister’s wisdom
Meghan, a 7-year-old girl, loves Irish dancing,
music class, and her golden retriever, Clancy.
She also has a baby brother who was diag-
nosed with autism at the age of 2. Meghan
offers her advice about life with (as of this writ-
ing) 5-year-old Collin:
“Collin loves when my friends come over. I tell
my new friends: ‘He has something called AW-
tism. It’s when your brain works different from
everyone else, but that’s okay. He’s just like you
and me but special and different.’”
“That’s the word — special. He knows how to
log on to the computer. When he grows up, I
think he’ll be a computer maker. He has a lot of
talents — the computer, running.”
“He’s really sweet when he smiles and he’s get-
ting really good about sharing. He really likes
the TV. Once, I was riding on the scooter and he
kept saying ‘my turn, my turn.’ He gets really
mad at me if I change the channel. He starts
whining and running after me and he’ll bite me.
I get over it.”
“Collin knows something that I don’t know and I
have to figure it out or he’ll be taking over the
whole world.”
“One of my best moments was at the beach this
summer. We sat on the beach together. That
was one of the best moments of my life. We sat
on the smooth rocky sand with the little baby
clams. We sat under the seagulls. We kept on
smiling as the waves crashed together.”
“[When he bites] he’s trying to tell me, ‘your turn
is up,’ then ‘you’re gonna get it.’ You have to
learn to deal with it. If he bites, just say ‘no.’ You
have to learn to be patient and say it again. If he
does something wrong, give him other chances.
Just remember to keep loving him no matter
what. You’ll find the answer when he’s older and
can talk to you.”

a child’s advanced vocabulary and arcane knowledge can set him apart.
Asperger kids can seem arrogant or condescending to others who don’t share
their intellectual interests. (For more on Asperger’s, see Chapter 5.) As for
kids in other places on the autism spectrum, they often don’t have the means
to communicate their needs or reach out appropriately.
It can be hard for autistic kids to fit in. Yet, a few positive friendships may be
all that a particular child needs or wants — he or she doesn’t necessarily
need a large group of friends to be happy. Many people prefer to have a few
good relationships in which they feel understood and accepted rather than
many superficial contacts. In this section, we discuss fostering friendships
between autistic children with differing levels of communication and their
peers.
Encourage autistic kids to get to know other children like themselves and to
spend time with safe adults. They may be more comfortable with kids like
them and adults than with other children, although emotionally they’re still
very much children and need interaction with children their own age. Also,
respect if your child has a frequent need for solitude, even if it isn’t what you
would choose for him.
Staging an emotional rescue
Autistic children have difficulty recognizing or being able to express emotion.
The absence of visible emotion doesn’t indicate emotional maturity or insen-
sitivity, necessarily, although people can mistake the absence for these things
in an older child. The emotional immaturity of autistic children shows in dif-
ferent ways. They may not be in touch with what they’re feeling, and they
may express their frustration and pain through tantrums, depression, or irri-
tability. You need to help an autistic child learn to recognize and communi-
cate feelings appropriately. Teach her the emotional vocabulary that she
needs, even if it seems obvious to you. It isn’t obvious to her.
An added challenge is that children with autism can be socially and emotion-
ally inappropriate in their comments — not out of meanness, but simply
because they don’t know any better. From an early age, autistic children need
a great deal of social coaching and communication support.
This list suggests ways to help a child’s social and emotional adjustment:
 Walk him through social situations, such as going to a restaurant or
going to the doctor, and demonstrate what social expectations and
norms he must follow. Role-plays and social stories are also useful for
modeling behavior. Asperger kids in particular enjoy the drama and can
be gifted actors and mimics. “Social stories,” a concept popularized by
Carol Gray, provides many very helpful examples of this type of thing.
See the next section for more on social stories.
265
Chapter 13: Fostering Healthy Relationships

If your child enjoys drama, consider signing him up for a drama class.
Many adults with Asperger Syndrome report that enrolling in a drama
course was incredibly helpful. Why? Because a drama class allows you
to examine in minute detail many typical social interactions and practice
them until you get them right. You can then generalize these skills to
other situations (see Chapter 10 for more on transferring skills).
 Differentiate between social norms that she must follow (such as not
talking during a movie) and those that are optional (such as making
small talk). Explain that you perform certain behaviors out of social con-
vention, and that if she breaks social conventions, she may make others
uncomfortable, although the rule may have no apparent purpose.
 Take an activity your child enjoys doing alone, such as playing a video
game, and have him do it with a parent, other child, or a sibling.
Encourage him to start or join a club for others with similar interests.
 Provide your child with a quiet place to retreat when noise and commo-
tion become overwhelming. Holidays and other group activities can be
more stressful for an autistic child. It can be hard to filter out others’
conversations when tons of noise pervades a room. Bring a CD player or
iPod if the child likes music to help filter out the noise.
 Explain to relatives and others in contact with your child that touching
her without warning can startle her or make her feel pain. They shouldn’t
take offense. It’s a physical issue, not an emotional one.
 Your autistic child may have trouble empathizing or understanding why
others feel the way they do. You need to stress that just as she wants
respect for her own feelings and desires, others want this same respect,
even if she doesn’t think their feelings are “logical.”
 Be sensitive to your child’s possible sensitivities. Social situations involv-
ing meals mean that the child has the complicated task of attending to
multiple stimuli: conversation, taste, smells, touch, and so on. Your child
isn’t being deliberately picky if she doesn’t eat everything — she may
have unpleasant reactions to certain foods. Many autistic children have
to go on special diets — not because they’re picky, but because they’re
sensitive to certain foods. (See Chapter 8 for more on diet.)
Creating social stories and 
calling on Power Cards
Developed by Carol Gray, social stories are vignettes designed to explain how
social interactions work. As Gray explains in her book, The New Social Story
Book (Future Horizons), the process of developing the story also increases
social understanding for both the person with autism and persons support-
ing those with autism.
266
Part III: Enhancing Learning and Social Skills 

A social story contains directive, descriptive, and affirmative sentences. You
use directive sentences to suggest appropriate actions and to instruct how to
decode recognition. You use affirmative sentences to express commonly
shared values or opinions of people in a given situation. Descriptive sen-
tences are logical and accurate factual statements, summarizing the situa-
tion. For example, suppose a child blurts out answers in class without
waiting to be picked by the teacher, and she gets frustrated when the teacher
tells her that she should wait her turn. A caregiver could develop a social
story that describes a student’s perspectives, experiences, and interactions
in a classroom.
Here’s a sample social story with the type of sentences indicated:
When the teacher asks a question, many students would like to provide
an answer. Descriptive
It’s hard for a teacher to hear when several students try to answer at
once. Descriptive
Students in a classroom need to take turns talking. Affirmative
When I want to answer a question that the teacher asks in class, I will try
to sit quietly and raise my hand. Directive
The teacher may call on me to answer or the teacher may give another
student a turn at answering the question. Descriptive
Carol Gray recommends a ratio of 0 to 1 directive sentences to 2 to 5 descrip-
tive and/or affirmative sentences to a social story.
Using Power Cards is another approach to improving social interaction.
Power Cards employ a special interest or passion the child with autism has,
along with a “hero” figure. As with social stories, a person supporting or
teaching develops a vignette concerning a challenging area for the child. The
helper goes over the story with the child and summarizes it on a small card,
such as an index card.
Say you stick with the example of the child waiting to be chosen by the
teacher. You can pair the behavior with the child’s special interest in her
favorite doll Sally, for example. Figure 13-1 shows an example of a Power Card
featuring steps suggested by Sally for helping your child deal with the situa-
tion. Initially, the parent or other person supporting the person with autism
provides reminders to use the Power Card as needed. The goal is to have the
person on the autism spectrum independently know when and where to refer
to these cards as appropriate.
267
Chapter 13: Fostering Healthy Relationships

Check out Power Cards: Using Special Interests to Motivate Children and Youth
with Asperger Syndrome and Autism, by Elisa Gagnon (Autism Asperger
Publishing Company), for more information on using Power Cards successfully.
Making conversation
Executive functioning is a term that describes the self-monitoring the brain
enacts to take in information, process it, and respond to it. Autism interferes
with executive functioning, meaning that autistic children can easily miss
social cues and misread the facial expressions of others. For example, the
child may notice that someone is crying, but not understand what that means
and respond inappropriately by laughing or walking away. Autistic kids also
aren’t very aware of how they sound to others; thus, their speech can be too
loud or have intonations or rhythms that seem off because they don’t know
how to modulate their voices. For these reasons, speech therapy can be very
helpful — both professional and improvised, the latter of which is discussed
in this section.
Autistic children take things literally in conversation and may have trouble
understanding sarcasm, pretending, or when someone is lying or trying to
con them. This naivete means that they may not understand the need to hold
things back, making them easy prey for bullies or worse, child predators.
Teach them early what constitutes appropriate conversation and behavior
with strangers.
Here are some other suggestions for facilitating conversations:
 Explain that people sometimes say things they don’t mean literally. This
isn’t necessarily lying, but it can be. Teach your child the difference
between lying and joking. Tone of voice and facial expressions can be
Sally wants you to remember to choose one of the following ways to help calm yourself 
if you get frustrated when you wait for your teacher to call on you to answer a question. 
If one way doesn’t work, try another. If the teacher doesn’t call on you this time, he’ll 
call on you later.
1. Take five deep breaths, exhaling
    slowly after each breath.
2. Close your eyes and slowly count
    backward from 10 to 1.
3. Quietly read a book at your desk.

268

clues, but your child may have trouble decoding such subtleties.
Encourage her to ask questions for clarification, such as “Are you kid-
ding?” or “What do you mean?”
 Help your child prepare for new social events by talking about what will
happen and what kinds of things you should say in those situations. The
practice will ease anxiety for her and give her some tools.
 Clearly distinguish between honesty and rudeness. For example, he can
say to Aunt Martha, “It hurts when you hug me like that.” However, he
should avoid saying “You look fatter every time I see you!”
 Help your child learn “give and take” in conversation. Sometimes
Asperger children can alienate others by lecturing or monologuing about
their own interests instead of listening or reciprocating in conversation.
Teach her to bat the ball back by saying things like, “What do you
think?” or “What about you?”
 Conversation between two people is infinitely easier than a conversation
between three or more people. Some skills that work in a two-person
conversation don’t work in a larger conversation. The cues (such as
when it is okay to talk) are much more subtle. (Many neurotypical
people haven’t mastered these skills.) For example, it’s not uncommon
for two or more people to begin talking at the same time. The person
with autism will need coaching to learn to identify and handle situations
such as this.
It helps to work out a discreet signal you can use with your child when he’s 
in a group to indicate that he should yield the floor to someone else, lower
his voice, or redirect his attention. The signal should be gentle and non-
critical — something that won’t make him feel worse about his social 
difficulties.
Any signal that the child knows to look for will work, but you don’t want it to
be obvious to others that you are communicating. We suggest something nat-
ural and inconspicuous such as tugging an earlobe, scratching your nose, or
removing or cleaning eyeglasses.
Sparking interactive play
Initiating friendly play between typical people and a child who’s more
affected by autism may take time, but it is possible. Such interactions require
scaffolding by a supportive person, such as an adult or older child who’s
knowledgeable about autism.
Often, playtime starts with parallel play, where the other person is playing
alongside the child, allowing the child time to get comfortable with an out-
side presence. Here’s a possible sequence of events for a child who loves to
line up blocks in rows on the carpet:
269
Chapter 13: Fostering Healthy Relationships

1. You get down next to the child and begin lining up your own row —
next to his, but not so close that he becomes disturbed.
2. You try pushing one of his blocks out of alignment, slightly, after a
few minutes, just to get his attention a little bit.
When he puts it back, you know he’s aware of your presence.
3. When you’re sure that he’s feeling safe, you can gradually prompt him
to interact a little more by doing things such as turning your row side-
ways toward his or building a bridge to his row.
Hopefully, he will meet you part of the way with his own blocks.
4. You can try to get his attention by putting a block near your face so he
has to make eye contact, however briefly.
Any way you can get him to enter your world voluntarily is a step toward
mutual interaction. In this play, you build a bridge that’s not only literal, but
also figurative. (These steps are from a cognitive-developmental method
known as the Miller Method, described more fully in Chapter 9.)
Respecting differences
A little acceptance and tolerance of your autistic child’s differences goes a
long way — for your entire family. Family and friends of autistic children get
life lessons in understanding those who are different from them. Here are
some tips to keep the waves as smooth as possible:
 Watch what expectations you place upon the child socially. How many
friends is enough? Is it for you or for her that you’re doing something?
Are you expecting behavior that she hasn’t learned yet?
 Be sensitive to overstimulation. Social groups can be quite overwhelm-
ing and tiring for your child. When he gets home from school, let him 
be alone for a little while to decompress. At a party, while shopping, or
at a theater, give him the opportunity to leave early, before he gets 
overstimulated.
 Carefully tread the fine line between “fitting in” and “selling out.”
You want your child to be accepted, but maybe the price of changing is
too high. Maybe your child has no desire to pay that price. It may be
better to change the child’s classroom, school, or placement than to
force something that isn’t working out. Allow the child some input into
what she wants from her life.

A
dults with autism often get less attention than chil-
dren with autism. We believe this needs to change,
as evidenced by Part IV, and we’re not the only ones.
Adults with autism and Asperger’s need help choosing
careers, navigating the complexities of higher education,
and understanding social relationships. In this part, we
talk to both people on the autism spectrum and to those
who support them about social skills, romantic relation-
ships, and the worlds of work and college. Other facets of
life that we cover include money issues, legal rights, and
living options for adults.

 Seeking appropriate employment opportunities
 Becoming a part of your community (and communities within your community)
L
ife after graduation from public school presents many opportunities and
challenges for people both on and off the autism spectrum. You must
manage your life by making some important decisions about seeking employ-
ment, furthering your education, choosing a living situation, and becoming
involved in the community. Making big decisions can be especially challeng-
ing for people on the autism spectrum. Often, a person on the spectrum
needs assistance in one or more of these areas.
In this chapter, we speak to you, a high-functioning adult on the autism spec-
trum who’s looking to blaze a path in a new walk of life. We examine how you
can handle all the inevitable decisions and stressors bound to come your
way. We help you figure out when (and where) to pursue additional educa-
tion. We give you tips for finding the right living situation. And we help you
choose when and how to get involved in your community.
Finally, if you’re a caregiver for someone on the autism spectrum, you know
that caring for your child doesn’t end when he turns 18 (whether he has
autism or not). For the rest of your life, you’ll be concerned and involved in
the many choices and decisions he makes. If your child has autism, your level
of involvement may be extensive. This chapter is here to assist you in helping
your child succeed in life after high school. We devote separate “For care-
givers” sections to help you make the most of your child’s adult life.

Low-functioning autistic kids may have fewer opportunities than high-
functioning kids after high school. Low-functioning kids can set goals 
that include finding a job, but the jobs they find may include work in super-
vised workshops or other areas of supported employment. However, all 
individuals on the autism spectrum should try to maximize their abilities,
regardless of their functional capacity.
Discovering How to Live
Interdependently
The majority of kids in high school want the same thing: independence. They
achieve this by moving out of the house and getting a job or going to college.
However, nobody is truly independent, and a person on the autism spectrum
may never come close to independence. Interdependent, rather than indepen-
dent, living is a more appropriate goal, because most people appropriately
depend on others to get along. For example, a spouse may depend on his part-
ner to keep the house clean or to take care of paying the bills, while he cooks
and takes care of the laundry. Even a person on a deserted island depends on
the weather, plants, and other animals to survive. The key to success — and
this is especially important for someone on the autism spectrum — is finding
appropriate interdependence.
Managing your daily life
Living interdependently begins with competency in regular living skills, such
as the following:
 Keeping your living area clean. Cleaning and organizing can make your
living space presentable to friends and family members who may visit
you, and you save a great deal of time when you need to find something
important.
 Getting along with others, like roommates and neighbors. You should
try to get to know the people around you. People living with or close to
you can be people who can potentially help and support you when you
need it. Arguing with neighbors and roommates can cause stress and be
both upsetting to you and the people you’re upset with.
 Managing your time, both free and structured. You need to keep track
of what you must do. You can get easily overwhelmed if you don’t keep
track of your time. Don’t wait until the last possible moment to finish
important tasks, like paying bills or signing up for class work.
274
Part IV: Living with Autism as an Adult 

 Socializing with others, both professionally and personally. Take the
time to show that you’re interested in the people around you. People
appreciate when you ask how they’re doing or even just say “hello.” Con-
sider looking into the Relationship Development Intervention, created by
Steven Gutstein, which we describe in Chapter 9. This intervention gives
you further work on developing skills in experience-sharing interactions.
 Budgeting your money. You must keep track of your money. If you can’t
keep a simple budget, you may get in financial trouble and not be able to
pay for essential items like food and housing. You need to know how
much of your money to allocate for life essentials (food, clothing, hous-
ing, and so on) versus how much money you can budget to spend on fun
activities.
 Preparing and eating nutritious meals. A healthy diet contributes to a
healthy body and mind. Eating regular nutritious meals gives you the
energy to be able to do what you need to get done every day. (See
Chapter 8 for more on optimizing your nutrition.)
 Self-advocating and disclosing. Self-advocacy becomes necessary when
your condition significantly impacts a situation or relationship, and all
parties need a better mutual understanding. And with self-advocacy
comes disclosure; after all, you need to tell others why you’re advocating.
For example, you may need to request that an employer use a certain
type of lighting if you have visual sensitivities, or you may ask that direc-
tions be provided in written form if you have challenges with central
auditory processing (in other words, your hearing gets scrambled). In
these situations, you are advocating for yourself, and if the other parties
want reasons, you may have to disclose.
If you’re still in K-12, consult with your Individualized Education
Program (IEP; see Chapter 12) team to begin learning the necessary
skills to talk about your style of processing information and the help-
ful accommodations you need. Also, check out the “Practicing self-
advocacy and disclosure” section later in this chapter.
Deciding where to live
Choosing a place to live is one of the most important decisions you’ll make.
Many considerations go into your decision on where to live. You need to con-
sider the type of living situation you desire. For example, you may choose to
live at home with your parents, or you may want to live by yourself or with
roommates in a home, a condominium, or an apartment. You could also
choose one of the many kinds of supported living situations, such as a group
home or even an institution. You must decide which situation is suitable to
your needs, desires, and financial situation.
275
Chapter 14: For Adults with Autism: Living Well after K-12

Home/apartment living tends to rank the highest on the interdependence
scale. However, you and those who support you can bring assistance into
these living situations as needed. In the following list, we describe some of
the more important characteristics of various living situations, along with
some benefits and drawbacks of each:
 Your parent’s/caregivers’ home: Living at home often seems to be the
easiest choice due to your familiarity with the surroundings and/or the
people already living there. However, you need to think of how you’ll
manage when your parents or others can no longer help with managing
the aspects of running a home. Living at home, though, is often the least
expensive option.
 Apartment/home: Apartment/home living can involve having room-
mates or living alone, depending on your situation. You need a greater
self-reliance because family members aren’t present to help immediately
if needed. Although living alone is often more expensive than living at
home, you can reduce the cost by finding roommates. However, it’s
important that you find roommates you can get along with and who
understand your needs.
 Group home: Group homes specialize in providing support to people
with autism and other conditions. Given the additional support inherent
in these living situations, group homes are likely to be more expensive
than the first two options.
 Institution: You may choose to turn to an institution if you find that the
other options can’t meet or manage your needs. Although most people
think of institutions as a last resort, they may be the answer for you. 
We’ve just barely scratched the surface of what choices you have for your
living arrangements. For further information, we suggest you contact your
local Autism Society of America chapter (ASA; www.autism-society.org)
or other organization devoted to helping the autism community.
For caregivers: Preparing your dependent
to succeed from day one
It’s never too early to start preparing your child for as much interdependent
living as possible. You want your child to have competency in regular living
skills to prepare him for a life of interdependence (see the previous section),
so you can help by adhering to the suggestions in the following list:
 Cleanliness: Even young children can help keep their bedrooms and
common areas of your home clean. For a person with Asperger Syndrome
who just can’t keep her room clean, you can at least insist on enlisting
her help in keeping the rest of the house tidy. High-functioning children
276
Part IV: Living with Autism as an Adult 

on the spectrum can begin learning the skills to keep their living areas
clean after they develop the understanding of what unclean is when
compared to cleanliness.
 Getting along with others: You should encourage a high-functioning
child with verbal skills to try to interact with others as soon as she
develops meaningful speech. Interventions such as social stories (cre-
ated by Carol Grey), Power Cards (created by Elisa Gagnon), and other
techniques can be very helpful in teaching people with Asperger
Syndrome how to successfully get along with others. Look for more
information about both systems in Chapter 13.
 Time management: You need to teach your child how to keep track of
how much time she has to complete tasks. As soon as high-functioning
children on the spectrum can tell time, you can begin to discuss with
them the importance of being on time and keeping track of how long
they have to get things done.
 Budgeting money: If your child is high-functioning and can appreciate
the concept of money, you need to reinforce with your child that many
items have a price and that monetary value is placed on objects and ser-
vices in all aspects of the community.
 Nutrition: Teach your child to eat a healthy diet by providing her with
healthy food options throughout her life. All caregivers of children on
the spectrum should be models for nutritional eating.
 Self-advocacy: Self-advocacy is an important skill that should be directly
taught to people on the autism spectrum. One of the best ways you can
teach self-advocacy is to promote your child’s involvement in her own
Individualized Education Program (IEP) to the extent of her ability. (For
more on IEPs, see Chapter 12.)
Even if your child isn’t likely to be able to live as interdependently as you
may have hoped for, you still can work on basic life skills like cleanliness and
socialization to make life easier at home.
Out of the High-School Daze: 
Pursuing Higher Education
Higher education refers to education after high school. For people on or off
the autism spectrum, higher education may involve further vocational educa-
tion, a technical school, a two-year college, or a four-year university. Some
people may choose to pursue higher education by attending and participat-
ing in classes or by taking correspondence or distance learning courses from
home. You, a high-functioning individual on the autism spectrum, have just as
many options as most people. 
277
Chapter 14: For Adults with Autism: Living Well after K-12

Like every neurotypical adult considering postsecondary education, your
program should meet your needs. Unlike every neurotypical adult, however,
you have some special considerations when choosing to pursue higher edu-
cation. In this section, we cover these considerations to help prepare you for
the road that lies ahead and get you out of your high-school daze!
Evaluating your educational options
When choosing the right place to continue your educational journey, you
have to look at the characteristics, pros, and cons of the varied options avail-
able to you. The goal is to choose the option that’s best for you instead of
getting stuck on the type of institution providing the education. You need to
consider your goals and find out what educational setting can best help you
achieve those goals. If you want to be a carpenter, for instance, it makes
sense to pursue vocational training at a local community college that focuses
on carpentry instead of trying to get a bachelor’s degree at a four-year col-
lege and then pursuing carpentry training.
Choosing face-to-face or distance learning
With the rise in technology, classes can now be held in a face-to-face format,
which is the more traditional method, and through correspondence or dis-
tance learning. Face-to-face education takes place when a teacher, facilitator,
or tutor provides instruction to learners in a group setting. Distance learning
occurs when a student and a teacher are separated geographically (over
some distance), and the learning and assessment takes place remotely, usu-
ally over the Internet. A teacher may post lectures and assignments on a Web
site, and the student may submit papers via e-mail, for example.
As an adult living with autism, you must weigh the pros of each type of learn-
ing against the cons to decide what methods work best for your needs and
goals. The following sections help you organize your thoughts.
The pros and cons of face-to-face learning
If you’re looking for face-to-face educational opportunities, you should consult
a guidance counselor at your school to discuss how to go about applying to
such institutions. The application process for someone on the spectrum
should generally be the same as the process for neurotypical kids. You may be
able to get additional advice about how to apply by consulting your IEP team.
The benefits of face-to-face education for people with autism include
 Direct interaction with the instructor and other students, which can
help with motivation
 A set time, which benefits people with autism who like to stick to routines
278
Part IV: Living with Autism as an Adult 

 Easy access to the resources of the educational institution
 Social opportunities for participating in study groups and making friends
The structured nature of face-to-face education often makes it easier for
people with autism to interact with others because everyone is present for a
common purpose.
Face-to-face education doesn’t get all A’s, though. Here are some of the draw-
backs to this type of instruction for the autistic person:
 Transportation requirements. Transportation can be especially difficult
if you don’t drive or have access to public transportation or available
acquaintances. You may be able to avoid this drawback if you address it
ahead of time. Be sure to ask a potential school if it has transportation
available to you after you arrive on campus. You can then use availabil-
ity of transportation as a factor in your decision-making process.
 Having to keep to a set schedule. Usually, set, predictable schedules 
are agreeable to people with autism. However, this instruction method
requires that you be available during class time on a consistent basis.
Ask to see potential class schedules before picking a school. This way,
you can try to find out ahead of time if class schedules will likely work
out for you.
 Environmental issues. Some autistic students may experience a sensory
assault from lighting, noise, and proximity to other students that may
interfere with successful learning. Take the time to visit your school’s
rooms and buildings before enrolling. See if the setting appears con-
ducive to your ability to learn. This way, you can test how things will be
when you’re in the same classroom as other students.
Although more stress may come with face-to-face learning, the potential gains
from this learning style are often greater than in distance learning. Face-to-
face learning can potentially improve your social skills, and the situations
better mimic the “real world” of work where people directly interact through-
out the day.
The pros and cons of distance learning
Distance learning involves interaction with your instructor through a commu-
nication channel such as a computer, telephone, or mailed correspondence.
Many universities offer distance-learning programs. You can consult with
your school guidance counselor or members of your IEP team for advice on
finding distance learning opportunities.
Some of the benefits to distance education for an individual with autism
include the following:
279
Chapter 14: For Adults with Autism: Living Well after K-12

 Easier access. You can work with materials at home and anywhere you
can find a computer, if a computer is necessary.
 Scheduling flexibility. Other than scheduled computer chat-room dis-
cussions, a common component of distance learning, you can usually do
work according to your schedule.
 Preferred environment. Because you’re in a familiar environment —
most likely your home — you should have few, if any, problems with 
sensory issues.
However, distance learning isn’t all “beer and skittles” for the autistic individ-
ual. You may find some significant drawbacks to distance education:
 Motivation. You must have strong internal motivation to get your work
done because you don’t have a face-to-face instructor to encourage you
and peers to help you.
 Setting aside study time. You have to make sure you set aside time and
space for studying and homework.
 Less time to interact with others. Distance learning doesn’t expose you
to daily social interaction. Individuals participating in distance learning
need to make time for social activities during their free time and give the
extra effort.
Considering the benefits of attending a community college
Transitioning to adulthood and higher education is a big challenge. Spending
some time at a community college can ease that transition and may make
sense for you for a number of practical reasons:
 Greater awareness of student diversity: I (co-author Stephen Shore)
have noticed a greater number of people with learning differences at the
community-college level than at four-year institutions. As a result, com-
munity colleges may have greater experience and expertise in working
with students with disabilities.
Along with this diversity comes different levels of academic time com-
mitment. At a community college, it may be just as acceptable to take
one class as it is to take a full load in any given semester. At a four-year
institution, you may find it more difficult to take a smaller course load.
And one of the best benefits of community college is that because you
see a greater diversity of students, people with autism are more likely to
be accepted.
 A place to explore with less academic pressure and expense: Many
people come to a community college for educational exploration, not to
feed the drive to complete a degree immediately. Many highly educated
280
Part IV: Living with Autism as an Adult 

persons use community college as a sort of “graduate” program to
explore other areas of interest.
Many students also use the community college experience as a transition
to a four-year college or university. Several states have matriculation
agreements with four-year colleges so that all the credits you earn in the
first two years directly transfer to the state college or university — and at
a great savings in tuition and fees for the student.
 Practical education with master teachers: Community-college faculty
members tend to be closer to their areas of instruction than instructors
at colleges and universities. Most instructors have master’s degrees 
in their subject areas, which helps them focus more on the art of teach-
ing and student service and less on research. An added bonus is that
community-college instructors tend to have more time for providing
extra help and advising students.
Here’s a short list of the drawbacks that accompany a community-college
education:
 You may not be able to reach some of your lofty goals with a 
community-college education. Individuals who want to pursue jobs 
that require four-year degrees won’t be able to adequately prepare 
themselves for the work by attending a community-college two-year 
program.
 The stigma. Some people don’t consider a community or two-year col-
lege to be a “real” place of higher education, even though it may be more
real-world based than many four-year institutions.
Exploring the four-year university option
Here are a few good reasons to consider applying to a four-year institution for
your higher education:
 Diversity of topics. A four-year college may have more classes and areas
of focus to choose from.
 Research orientation. If you’re interested in learning about and con-
ducting research, a four-year university may be for you.
 Stability. It usually takes four years of full-time work to earn a bachelor’s
degree, and students may stay even longer for master’s and doctoral
courses if the institution provides them. Additionally, you tend to find
more full-time and tenured faculty at these institutions. As a result,
change usually comes more slowly (which may be a good thing, depend-
ing on your needs).
Community colleges tend to have open admissions, whereas four-year institu-
tions lean toward competitive admissions. One method isn’t necessarily
better than the other; it all depends on your wants and needs.
281
Chapter 14: For Adults with Autism: Living Well after K-12

As with your other higher-education options, the four-year institution comes
with disadvantages that you need to consider before you send in your appli-
cation letter:
 A four-year institution may have more options when it comes to classes
and majors, but the majors provided may be general and not focused on
job-specific abilities. If you want to be an accountant, for example, you
may be able to take economics classes, but does the institution offer
accounting-specific classes that prepare you for the real world?
 A four-year institution may not have comparable disability services,
which provide you with needed accommodations. You may be in the
vast minority when it comes to living on a college campus, so the institu-
tion may not cater to your needs as much.
 The expenses that come with a four-year institution are generally much
greater than at community colleges.
 If you live on campus, you may have to share a room with other stu-
dents. Living in a residence hall, with its noise and many other distrac-
tions, can be difficult for someone with sensory challenges and a high
need for solitude and/or personal space. Consider whether this is opti-
mal for you. On the other hand, living in close contact with other stu-
dents allows you to make friends slowly, over the course of a year, by
getting to know people and how they live up-close.
Getting the accommodations you 
need for higher education
In addition to making sure the higher-education program you’re interested in
is a good fit academically, socially, and otherwise, you have to make sure the
disabilities office associated with the program (sometimes called the “office
of student support” or “office of student success”) can provide your needed
accommodations. 
After graduation from high school, protection under the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA; see Chapter 12) ends, and the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) takes over. The major difference is this: The IDEA man-
dates that all public schools (K-12) find, assess, and provide accommodations
in order to meet the legal tenets of “a free and appropriate” public education.
The ADA merely requires institutes of higher education, on the other hand, to
provide equal access to education. As a college student, you must meet with a
disabilities counselor and advocate for these accommodations on your own
(this applies to both distance and face-to-face learning programs).
282
Part IV: Living with Autism as an Adult 

Working with the disabilities office of the institution you affiliate with is impor-
tant. Make an appointment with the disabilities office as part of a campus tour
to find out what the office can provide along with its requirements for obtain-
ing accommodations. You should find out answers to the following questions
from the school’s disabilities office before you decide to attend the school:
 Can the school provide your needed accommodations? A negative
answer should motivate you to strongly reconsider applying to that
school.
 What documentation do you need to provide to obtain accommoda-
tions? Many students lose out on accommodations for as long as a
semester or more because they fail to provide appropriate documenta-
tion, such as medical documentation from their doctors describing their
impairments.
 How recent must your documentation be? Many schools have a one- to
three-year timeline. If you lack a recent key document, such as a recent
neuropsychological examination, it can take as long as 18 months to get
another test.
As a person with a disability, you have to advocate for your needs and dis-
close your condition on your own (see the following section). However, you
can get help from a friend, family, or other person. You can bring this person
with you to meetings with disabilities counselors, and this person can make
sure you cover all the important details during your meetings.
Practicing self-advocacy and disclosure
There comes a time when every person with autism must make other people
aware of their needs, followed by an explanation, in a way the other people can
easily understand. For an autistic person attending an institution of higher
learning, this time is inevitable and likely to happen often. For example, educa-
tors and other students may ask you why you receive certain accommodations
from the institution. What you must decide is whether a full or a partial disclo-
sure is necessary.
During disclosure, you should stick to the facts. For example, if a person asks
you why you get to sit at your own table in the classroom, just say that you’re
easily distracted and suffer from autism, a disorder marked by communica-
tion delays and social skills impairment.
If you don’t want to disclose any disabilities you have to other students, dis-
tance learning may be a better option for you, because you’d have to disclose
only to those teaching you (see the section “Choosing face-to-face or distance
learning” for more).
283
Chapter 14: For Adults with Autism: Living Well after K-12

You can find more on the subject of self-advocacy and disclosure in co-author
Stephen Shore’s book, Ask and Tell: Self-Advocacy and Disclosure for People on
the Autism Spectrum (Autism Asperger Publishing Company). People on the
autism spectrum make all the contributions in the text.
Easing into higher education
If the commitment and socialization that come with higher education seem
overwhelming, consider phasing in the different components of higher educa-
tion one at a time. For example, instead of starting off as a full-time student at
a residential college, you can begin with the following options and ease your
way into full-time education:
 Take fewer (or even just one) classes a semester. Sure, cutting down on
your course load may mean it will take longer to get through school, but
extending your school days is much better than “crashing and burning”
as a result of a full class load. Note: It may be difficult to take a very lim-
ited schedule at a residential college.
 If you plan to live on campus, consider a single dorm room. Some
schools allow students to live in their own rooms, without roommates, 
if they can provide needed documentation (such as a letter from your
doctor confirming your impairment and noting that you’ll benefit from 
a single room). Inquire at the school’s disability office for more informa-
tion (see the section “Getting the accommodations you need for higher
education”).
 Consider attending a local school and living at home. Commuting from
home (and possibly taking classes at home; see the section “Choosing
face-to-face or distance learning”) can ease the stress of going to a new
school and having to move. You’re most likely to find support for inter-
dependent living at home.
 Consider hiring a personal assistant. You (or your caregiver) must
arrange and pay for this service. Part-time help is much more inexpen-
sive than hiring someone full time. Ask your institution’s disabilities
office if it can recommend anyone (even other students) to help you 
stay organized and on task while attending school.
If the idea of higher education seems too difficult at this time, you can post-
pone your continued education to a later time when you’re more ready. In 
the meantime, spend a lot of time researching the many different aspects of
higher education that we describe in this chapter. You can go through the
strategies we recommend in this book to assess potential higher-education
stressors and develop a plan to address each stressor before you go to
school.
284
Part IV: Living with Autism as an Adult 

For caregivers: Helping your dependent
realize his/her higher-education dreams
Parents and caregivers can provide a great deal of assistance during an indi-
vidual’s higher education decision-making process. You can help your spec-
trum child organize his search for higher-education opportunities by creating
lists of potential educational stressors and of the strengths and weaknesses
of how different educational opportunities can address these stressors.
After you and your dependent make a decision on higher education, consider
helping the child set up a plan to structure the learning process. You can
create a study schedule that motivates and keeps your loved one on track.
Even if you need to include some flexibility, having a set time to work helps
most people. (See the section “Discovering How to Live Interdependently” for
more advice to this end.)
Time to Nurture Your Bank Account:
Finding (and Keeping) Employment
After school, the next step of interdependent living is finding employment.
Most people desire gainful employment in an area that they enjoy and that
uses their strengths. The same holds true for people on the autism spectrum.
(Maintaining employment while in a higher-education program may at times
present overwhelming stress to someone on the spectrum.)
Levels of employment range from laboring in a sheltered workshop (a highly
structured environment that offers considerable assistance), to supported 
noncompetitive employment, to fully competitive employment. This section
focuses on helping you find the right position for your wants and needs, apply
for and obtain the position, keep the position, and bow out gracefully when the
time comes to move on. We also present the option of self-employment if that
route seems more to your liking. Happy job hunting!
Before you accept a job, you need to determine what will happen after you
get the job if you’ve been receiving government assistance for living and/or
health insurance. Although being productive and earning a wage is preferable
to receiving funding due to a disability, you need to be aware that most gov-
ernment programs have strict rules about how much money you can earn
before they curtail or take away benefits.
If you determine that taking a job is too costly in terms of lost assistance or
health insurance, you can still contribute to society on a volunteer basis.
Leading a fulfilling and productive life while giving back to society doesn’t
depend on you earning money from traditional employment.

Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley), by Max Messmer. And you can find more info

and Kate Duffy’s book, Developing Talents (Autism Asperger Publishing
Company), and in Roger Meyer’s Asperger Syndrome Employment Handbook
(Jessica Kingsley Publishers).
Matching your skills and desires 
with job opportunities
As an autistic person, you have many factors to consider when beginning
your job search, including the following:
 Your skill set: You should seek a position that involves a special interest
or skill you have.
 Issues unique to your condition: You have to consider any sensory or
distractibility issues you have when looking for a position. For example,
if you have the aptitude and desire to work a cash register, but you have
aural sensory issues, you may not be successful as a cashier in a busy
fast-food restaurant. Instead, you may need to find employment in a
position involving a slower, quieter pace.
 Your social requirements: Social requirements are important aspects of
most jobs because most jobs involve interacting directly with coworkers
or clients.
By matching available job opportunities with your characteristics and inter-
ests, you can experience employment success. Take a look at Table 14-1 to
see some of the possibilities out there for you. And for a more detailed look
into matching interests and careers, take a look at A Guide for Successful
Employment for Individuals with Autism (Brookes), by Marcia Datlow Smith,
Ronald G. Belcher, and Patricia Juhrs.

You can do your best to combat the issues you have if you really want a cer-
tain position. You can address any possible sound sensitivities, for example,

Working with a job coach
Because of the great diversity of the autism spectrum, many characteristics
of autism express themselves differently, to varying degrees, in different
people. Often, a support person is helpful in providing support and training
287
Chapter 14: For Adults with Autism: Living Well after K-12

in areas that may be difficult for you. You can seek support from many differ-
ent sources, and you can use any combination of support you see fit. Some of
these sources include the following:
 Job coach. You can look for providers of vocational rehabilitation that
will likely have job coaches as part of their services — coaches to assist
you in the workplace. Job coaches can check on your work progress and
help you to resolve conflicts if they develop on the job. As your advo-
cate in the workplace, a job coach is able to “carve out” a position for
you. In other words, he or she can take pieces from several jobs that
you’re able to complete well and that you like, which frees other employ-
ees to perform job duties that they do well and like. Sometimes, this may
mean talking an employer into reworking your existing job descriptions.
 Social worker. A social worker can assist you in finding potential commu-
nity resources that may support your employment, such as a job coach.
 Mentor. A mentor can be a model for how to conduct yourself at work.
Try to find a mentor with a similar disability, because this person proba-
bly has already been through some of the same problems you’re facing
in the workplace.
Applying for and obtaining a position
You can apply for and obtain employment in several different ways: submit-
ting a portfolio, pursuing networking opportunities, or sending a cover letter
and résumé are a few. In some cases, you may use a combination of more
than one method.
Whatever method you choose, one thing remains consistent: Employers focus
on hiring dependable workers who can independently complete a job after
training. Some characteristics that come with autism are advantageous to
meeting these employer goals. Your job (or the job of your employment spe-
cialist or job coach) is to emphasize how the profile of a person with autism is
beneficial to an employer — especially if the person hasn’t hired people on the
autism spectrum before. Here are some areas of benefit you can present to
employers (that show how hiring people with autism can help a company):
 Work skills. Because people with autism commonly have strong visual-
motor skills, they may enjoy exacting tasks where employers often expe-
rience high turnover rates.
 Affinity for routine. The preference for routine tends to drive employ-
ees with autism to be on time for work and to take only scheduled
breaks and specified lunch times. Absenteeism due to illness is rare
among people on the autism spectrum.
288
Part IV: Living with Autism as an Adult 

 Less interest in socialization. You can even reframe weaknesses in lan-
guage and social interaction as positives because most people with
autism don’t take time from work to socialize.
Of course, these are only general examples within each category. You have a
good grasp of your skill set, so make each point specific to your strengths. Now
that you have an idea of what you can use to your advantage to get a job, you
can apply this information when creating your portfolio or résumé and when
attending your interview. The following sections show you the ropes.
Some employers may have concerns about training a person with autism;
about you interfering with other people doing their jobs; about making
accommodations; and about dealing with potential challenging behaviors.
This is where a job coach or employment specialist can come in handy (see
the section “Working with a job coach”). The job coach or employment spe-
cialist should assure the employer that he or she will provide support to
handle these issues and, at least initially, serve as a bridge between you and
your employer. The job coach needs to be able to provide the support
needed in order for you to be successful on the job.
Creating a portfolio
You use a portfolio, or a collection of projects demonstrating your work capa-
bilities, as an initial “calling card” when applying for a position. Submitting a
portfolio places the focus on the work you can do rather than on the social
aspects of an interview. The portfolio is probably the most powerful way for
you to get your proverbial foot in the door to meet the person in charge of
hiring. The goal is to have that person focus on the quality of your work
rather than on any possible social challenges you may face due to autism.
A portfolio can include many different items, such as detailed drawings, tech-
nical reports, or any other work product you have previously created that
speaks to your ability to understand and process information. If you want to
get a mechanic position, for example, you may bring in pictures or scrapbooks
of cars you’ve put together, for instance. If you have a specific interest or abil-
ity, you can highlight this ability in your portfolio.
Networking
Many people get jobs through personal leads by friends, acquaintances, or
colleagues. Let others know you’re looking for a job and that you’d appreci-
ate them letting you know if they hear of possible opportunities. If you’re not
comfortable with the face-to-face networking associated with getting a job,
you can use means other than face-to-face contact. Be sure to send your
résumé out often and even post your résumé on the Internet at job-hunting
Web sites.
289
Chapter 14: For Adults with Autism: Living Well after K-12

Creating a cover letter and résumé
Most of the time, to get to the interview phase of the job-hunting process,
you have to submit a cover letter and résumé to your potential employer. You
should seek advice from your previous teachers or caregivers about how to
craft straightforward, effective résumés and cover letters. You don’t have to
begin disclosure of your disability in your cover letter; just try to present
your interest in the position clearly and have a well-organized résumé that
supports your capability of doing the job. Be sure to include references of
people you know well and who you think understand your disability and
believe that your disability won’t prevent you from being successful in the
workplace. You should have at least one person you trust to proofread and
possibly help you develop your cover letter and résumé.
When the company receives your cover letter and résumé, many people, like
a human resources representative and hiring supervisor, will review it.
Ultimately, the goal of your cover letter and résumé is to get the recruiters
interested enough to call you in for an interview.
We could say a ton about writing a good cover letter and résumé, but you can
find many books on the subject. You can check out books such as Résumés
For Dummies, 4th Edition (Wiley), and Cover Letters For Dummies, 2nd Edition
(Wiley), both by Joyce Lain Kennedy, along with the latest edition of Richard
Bolles’ What Color Is Your Parachute (Ten Speed Press) — a great guide for
designing cover letters and résumés for employment and for finding employ-
ment suitable to your strengths.
Completing an interview
The interview can be the most challenging part of the job search for people
with autism. This fact can be hard to swallow, because most employers agree
that the most powerful variable in who they hire for positions isn’t qualifica-
tions, but how well potential employees interview for the jobs.
If you have difficulties with social skills, you need to try hard to maintain
appropriate social interactions, including using eye contact and appropriate
nonverbal communication (nodding, smiling, and so on; see Chapter 10) to
show appropriate interest in the conversation. You should also talk with your
potential employer about whether your job coach can come along to your
interview; this should be a joint decision between you and your coach. A job
coach may be able to answer questions you can’t answer, such as how the
job coach can assist your potential employer in insuring your success in the
workplace.
290
Part IV: Living with Autism as an Adult 

Maintaining your job
After an employer awards you with the position you’ve been seeking (con-
grats!), your work has just begun — no pun intended. Keeping a job depends
on two requirements:
 Doing the job to the satisfaction of your managing supervisor. All
employees are expected to meet the expectations of their employers.
Make sure you understand what’s involved in the job, how to do the job,
and how to get help if you need it.
Managing this requirement is usually pretty easy for an autistic person. If
you run into any trouble, you can request/use any accommodations nec-
essary to communicate questions you may have to your supervisor, sup-
port person, or job coach to make sure you can do the best job possible.
If you have a job coach, it may be useful to have him approach your
employer about accommodation. This tactic saves you from the initial
stress of asking for accommodations. Over time, as you get more com-
fortable with your employers, you may become more willing to ask for
accommodations on your own.
 Meeting the social expectations of the job. This requirement can be
tougher for some people with autism. A large part of many jobs is main-
taining good social relations with coworkers and supervisors. The subtly
in workplace social dynamics can be very difficult for many people with
autism to decode and respond to. If you have one, you can ask your job
coach for advice on how to socialize appropriately with coworkers. You
can also attempt to watch how your coworkers interact and then try to
learn from these observations as you attempt to integrate yourself into
the workplace social scene.
Gracefully exiting your position
Research shows that most people change jobs several times during their
working lives. You may need to leave a job because of life circumstances,
change of interests, or because you simply don’t like your job or the people
you work with.
Whatever your reasons for departing a position, you should thank the people
you worked with for their assistance in helping you do a good job. In other
words, you should leave gracefully. Doing so will preserve good relations and
allow you to ask for a good recommendation in the future. It’s also very possi-
ble that previous coworkers and supervisors will show up in future positions
291
Chapter 14: For Adults with Autism: Living Well after K-12

you’ll be interested in pursuing. These people become part of your network,
for better or for worse. Even if you feel you were let go for unfair reasons
relating to your autism, it makes sense to leave your job on good terms,
because this kind of parting can only work to help you in the future.
When you leave a job, you need to find out how being unemployed may impact
the social-service (government) assistance you may be receiving. You may
need to ask caregivers or others you trust to help you figure out how leaving
a job will impact your financial situation.
Considering self-employment
Self-employment can be a viable option for many people on the autism spec-
trum. Some people like to work as consultants (computers, taxes, and so on)
because they can go into situations, solve the problems, work on their own
terms, and be out before office politics and socialization problems begin to
take their toll. I (co-author Stephen Shore) have cobbled together a career by
teaching college-level courses in autism and special education, working on
worldwide consulting jobs, speaking on autism-related issues, writing, and
teaching people with autism how to play music.
A self-employed individual still needs to look for work like someone employed
at an outside business. In the case of self-employment, looking for work
includes searching for buyers of your product or service. Tactics such as net-
working still come into play with self-employment, because you want to build
a network of individuals who may be interested in buying your product or
service.
Common characteristics of individuals who succeed in self-employment
include an independent spirit and a strong work ethic. If you’re going to be
successful working on your own, you must be willing to expend a great deal
of time and effort making your self-employment profitable. People who do
well aren’t people who always depend on positive feedback from others. You
need to be somewhat independent-minded and willing to take some risks if
you plan on being self-employed.
Most of the downsides of self-employment point to income, which can be
unreliable. Self-employed individuals have to figure out how to pay their
taxes and withhold taxes from their profits without the help of an employer.
You also face additional organizational challenges, marketing needs, and
other requirements that can be tough for people both on and off the autism

For caregivers: Helping a dependent 
find employment
As a caregiver, you need to consider the challenges your loved one faces due
to autism and the characteristics of autism he exhibits when looking into pos-
sible vocational choices and career paths for him. Examining the characteris-
tics he exhibits (like a strong need for order and visual strength, for example)
is actually just an extension of considering anybody’s profile of strengths and
challenges when determining the person’s ability to hold a position. In other
words, you want to conduct a mini-interview with your autistic loved one to
find out what path best suits him. That path, of course, depends on where
your loved one rests on the autism spectrum.
Helping a high-functioning individual find (and keep) employment
As a caregiver, you can assist the person in your life with high-functioning
autism in his job search by committing to the following actions:
 Watch how he likes to spend most of his time, and suggest what type of
work he may be happy with. (See the section “Matching your skills and
desires with job opportunities”.)
 Offer to develop, proofread, or even type résumés and cover letters he
needs after he decides what type of employment he wants to pursue. If
telephone communication is a challenge for him, offer to make calls.
(See the section “Applying for and obtaining a position”.)
 Help with networking by checking in with local social-service agencies.
You can look to a vocational rehabilitation agency, special-education
teachers, and community support groups, to name a few. You can also
ask businesses in the area if they may have employee vacancies that
require the skills your loved one possesses. 
 Find a job coach or vocational rehabilitation counselor to assist in the
job hunting. Supporting a person with autism is a complex and challeng-
ing task, so don’t be afraid to enlist the help of a person with the proper
background who can supply the needed assistance for obtaining and
maintaining a job. (See the section “Working with a job coach”.)
When the person under your care secures employment, your mission to help
doesn’t end. Follow the tips in this list to make sure the employment experi-
ence is positive for your loved one:
 Use social stories, Power Cards, discussion, or even role-playing to
address challenges in social interaction that may come up during your
loved one’s workday. (For more on these tools, check out Chapter 13.)
293
Chapter 14: For Adults with Autism: Living Well after K-12

 Address all issues concerning needed supports with little or no effort
from the employer. For example, the person under your care may have
the best sorting skills of anyone you know. However, if the person faces
challenges in verbal communication, dealing with frustration, and so on,
you must plan support to minimize these challenges prior to the person
starting the job. Having a misunderstanding or a tantrum on the job for
any reason isn’t conducive to employment success.
 Make sure that all appropriate colleagues communicate your loved one’s
job responsibilities through the communication means he uses. The
method may be verbal or through sign language, pictures, or a combina-
tion of methods. Many people refer to job manuals when starting out in
positions. Make sure the person under your care (as well as his support
person) has and understands the reference material.
 If the person understands the requirements of his position, but he still
can’t follow directions, you should conduct a functional behavioral
assessment (FBA) to determine the reason. An FBA looks at all the
causes and consequences of challenging behaviors and helps develop
systems for resolving the problem (see Chapter 11 for more on FBAs).
Some reasons for failing to follow directions may include insufficient 
or ineffective reinforcement, noxious sensory input, or, in rare cases,
sabotage from coworkers who don’t want to work with a person on the
autism spectrum.
Exploring employment opportunities for 
those more severely affected by autism
If the person under your care is more severely affected with autism, you have
to consider more formal and informal support to achieve a successful employ-
ment endeavor. With the right supports, even persons severely affected by
autism can find some form of employment.
Your job is to accurately assess the individual’s level of functioning and to
help him pursue vocational training that will prepare him for specific work-
place duties. You may connect a low-functioning individual with supported
workshop environments that cater to people with significant development
impairment. (For more on matching the needs of the person under your care
to a job opportunity, see the section “Matching your skills and desires with
job opportunities”.)
Another supportive working environment that may work for your loved one
is a sheltered workshop — if you’re willing to relocate (see the sidebar
“Sheltered workshops: Enhancing quality of life” for an explanation).

An Advocate Off the Ol’ Block: Getting
Involved with Your Community
Community involvement is a part of leading a productive and fulfilling life. In
fact, some studies indicate that community involvement is an important vari-
able in leading a long and healthy life. Involvement in the community takes
place on many levels, ranging from global to regional to your neighborhood.
Getting out into the community can be as simple as taking a field trip to a local
pizza joint or as complicated as spending several days on a trip to a point of
interest.
Involvement in the community also leads to the formation of additional com-
munities, a positive for any adult with autism who wants more socialization.
For both autistic and non-autistic people alike, community involvement gives
you a positive sense that you’re part of something larger and more valuable
than your individual being. Additionally, community involvement allows you
to develop a broader and stronger potential support system that you can
lean on during rough times.
Communities form around interests such as ballroom dancing, computers,
and causes like autism awareness and breast cancer. In this section, we take 
a look at some of the benefits of community involvement and how you can
join the vast number of communities that are as diverse as the autism spec-
trum itself.
295
Chapter 14: For Adults with Autism: Living Well after K-12
Sheltered workshops: Enhancing quality of life
Often thought of as a transitional step, a shel-
tered workshop is supposed to prepare people
with disabilities for independent, competitive
employment. For those persons unable to work
competitively, at least some form of employment
is possible thanks to the sheltered workshop.
Unfortunately, you see a tendency in many
places for this form of employment to become
little more than a place to warehouse people
with disabilities to perform repetitive, meaning-
less tasks.
Although popular for a period of time, sheltered
workshops have been in decline in the United
States. However, they still thrive in places around
the world. Located about 35 kilometers north-
west of Tokyo, Japan, Keyaki-no-Sato is an
excellent model of how a sheltered, residential
workshop can provide meaningful and produc-
tive employment. (For more information about the
workshop, see www.disabilityworld.
org/04-05_04/il/japan.shtml.)
I (co-author Stephen Shore) visited Keyaki-no-
Sato and was impressed with the cleanliness,
order, and teamwork between some severely
affected people with autism. Above all, I was
impressed with people living with dignity, pur-
pose, and happiness in their lives.

Don’t think the community is as large or as important as we make it out to
be? You need to widen your scope in thinking about your community. People
of a particular race, nationality, or culture can share common experiences 
of coming from a certain geographical location or share language, thought,
beliefs, religion, or other binding factors. Some people with autism enjoy
attending houses of worship, which tend to feature highly structured ser-
vices and other events. Your geographic community (or neighborhood) may
have interesting activities and opportunities for involvement. The possibili-
ties are everywhere!
Becoming a part of your community
Involvement within a community usually begins with an activity. For example,
if you’re a musician or are interested in music, you can join a community
band or get with like-minded music lovers and attend concerts (as long as
your senses can handle it). One of the reasons I (co-author Stephen Shore)
teach people with autism how to play musical instruments is to provide a
gateway to joining a community band or orchestra. I’ve spent many enjoyable
evenings playing in a community ensemble.
If you have athletic interests and skills, you can join a club or team in your
community. If team-oriented, ball-type sports are difficult for you, you can
look for more individual activities that can still be accomplished in groups.
You can bicycle with a local organization, join a jogging group hosted by a
sporting-goods store, or get with a group of people and attend a local sport-
ing event. Other types of community-based events can include going to
movies with roommates, coworkers, or friends; having picnics in a park; 
joining a book club; and participating in fundraising or awareness walks.
Activity based events are much more successful for people with autism than
socially based events. The activity forms the reason for the gathering and
provides the structure that people with autism commonly need. Socially ori-
ented activities (like a gala event or a singles’ dance) tend to be less struc-
tured. If you must attend a less-structured, socially based activity, you can do
your best to create a structure. Take a look at the sidebar in this section for
one example of how to do this.
If you’re looking to increase your social involvement, you may want to begin
with simple social gatherings with peers that you know. It may be worth
taking time to build up to big events, such as dances, with many strangers 
in attendance. It may also be helpful to develop a few positive peer relation-
ships with other people on the autism spectrum and then work with these
people to move toward increasing social involvement.
296
Part IV: Living with Autism as an Adult 

Looking within the autism community
Many people consider people with autism as a community. Within this large,
overarching community, you can find many smaller communities that provide
an opportunity for communication and the exchange of ideas. Such communi-
ties include autism conferences, Internet-based communities, and organiza-
tions run for and by autistic persons. The following sections outline these
communities in more detail.
Attending autism conferences
Autism conferences are places that provide opportunities to meet people and
build life-long friendships. Large autism conferences, such as the Autism
Society of America’s annual national conference (www.autism-society.
org), can have attendances of 1,500 to 2,000 people and between two- and
three-dozen autistic people taking part. In addition to giving presentations
and helping to plan the conferences, autistic persons quickly form their own
communities — the ASA’s conference features an Autism Town Meeting and 
a space referred to as the “Persons with Autism Room.” People not on the
autism spectrum are permitted to enter only on invitation and when escorted
by an autistic person.
Another particularly friendly event for people with autism is the annual
MAAP Services conference (MAAP stands for More advanced individuals with
Autism, Asperger Syndrome, and Pervasive Developmental Disorder). Like
with the ASA, MAAP puts special effort into respecting and accommodating
for the needs of people on the autism spectrum. Take a look at the Web site
www.maapservices.org for information on the next conference.

Chapter 14: For Adults with Autism: Living Well after K-12
Inserting structure where you find none
One time, my wife and I (co-author Stephen
Shore) were invited to a barbeque dinner within
the Chinese community that primarily involved
people talking to each other. I didn’t know many
people, and I felt uneasy about the lack of an
activity to structure the event.
Fortunately, I discovered that no one knew 
how to operate the gas grill to cook the food.
Neither did I! However, I quickly learned how to
operate the device, and soon I structured all my
interactions around preparing the food. Things
were going well, so I became emboldened.
A few years ago, I read in a body-language book
that a common male-bonding gesture is to play-
fully punch the shoulder of another fellow. I tried
it out, and soon a bunch of Chinese guys and I
were busy talking, and we all had a good time.
I attribute the success of this event to my being
able to find a structured activity within a rela-
tively unstructured event.

Considering Internet-based interaction
Computer-based communication seems particularly suited for many people
with autism. Because interactions are word-based and not face-to-face, 
you don’t have the distraction of attempting to decode nonverbal cues.
Additionally, face-to-face conversations are somewhat temporary, meaning
that words are spoken, and you have to aurally decode and remember them
during a conversation. This process can be very difficult or even impossible
for autistic people who have auditory processing or attentional issues. Words
on a computer screen don’t have to be spoken, and you can read them as
many times as you need.
Although cyberspace can be a great place to meet people, you need to realize
that people you meet online are strangers. To stay safe, keep the following
tips in mind (for more info on possible sites to visit on the Net, check out the
Appendix):
 Keep personal information private. If you wouldn’t give a stranger on
the street your phone number and address, don’t give them to someone
you just “met” online. Also, don’t share personal information about your
friends (including phone numbers and addresses) with your new online
friends.
 Make sure the person’s purported identity is accurate. It’s very easy to
make up an entire fictional personal profile online, just as it’s difficult to
prove who another person is without actually seeing the person.
However, you should do your best to try.
 Tell a trusted adult if someone makes you nervous online. Don’t be
afraid to let someone know that you’re uncomfortable with something
someone said to you or told you to do.
 Consider checking with a trusted friend before you send any pictures
of yourself to an online acquaintance. Sending a picture of yourself
over the Net may seem harmless, but you should double-check with
someone just to make sure the person agrees that it’s safe.
 Keep your password secret. Create a unique password that you can
remember. Use letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and different cases
wherever possible to make the password unpredictable.
 Meet an online friend only in a public place. If you choose to meet a
person for the first time face to face, do so in a public place that con-
tains many people. Also, make the initial meeting — and possibly several
of the meetings thereafter — short and casual. For example, you could
meet the person for a cup of coffee in a café.
Consider bringing a friend or other trusted person with you upon meet-
ing an online acquaintance in person for the first two or three times.

Part IV: Living with Autism as an Adult 

Trying out autistic-run organizations
One of the more well-known autistic-run organizations is Autism Network
International (ani.autistics.org). In addition to running a listserve 
(an Internet-based communication tool; see the Appendix) for people with
autism, ANI holds an annual conference known as Autreat. The event focuses
on the positives of living with autism rather than cures, interventions, or
striving for “normalcy.”
Finding businesses and other organizations that show interest in involving
people with autism on a daily basis can be very helpful. Becoming involved
with such organizations may lead to work, volunteer opportunities, and other
activities than can boost your involvement in the community.
For caregivers: Encouraging an adult 
with autism to get involved
Diversity (which is abundant in autism) brings richness to a community. As
with education and employment (see the previous sections of this chapter), 
a person with autism may need accommodations and support from an 
aide or a coach to feel the motivation to become involved in the community.
Caregivers of individuals at all functioning levels should encourage commu-
nity involvement. Even low-functioning individuals with autism can find some
aspects of community involvement that foster a sense of belonging and boost
self-esteem.
The level of accommodation and support needed can range from almost none
to intensive. When deciding on the level of help necessary, keep in mind that
the goal of inclusion within the community is to have both the person with
autism and the community benefit from the person’s involvement.
Some communities have drop-in centers that hold activities for people with
disabilities. However, these options have both pros and cons. A positive
aspect is that they provide support for people with autism and other disabili-
ties. A drawback is that these events separate people with these differences
from the larger community.
Encouraging community involvement can come in many ways, including
actions indicating that community involvement is important. In addition to
actions, kind words that promote community involvement can also help a
person’s concerns about becoming active.
299
Chapter 14: For Adults with Autism: Living Well after K-12

Here are some areas to consider when you want to support a loved one’s
involvement in the community:
 Transportation: For some people, transportation may mean both a 
ride to the event and social, behavioral, or other support at the event.
Others may only need to travel on a public bus instead of driving or
even walking.
 Communication: You may need to provide persons with no or limited
verbal ability other means of communication, such as sign language or
graphically-based tools, in addition to an aide or other support person.
You may want to encourage some situations, such as jogging with a club
or going to a ballgame, that require only minimal communication. (See
Chapter 10 for more on communication assistance.)
 Social: Because autistic people have trouble with nonverbal cues and
figurative language, the social aspect of community involvement can 
be challenging. You can encourage involvement by helping the person
under your care become more familiar with these types of communica-
tion. (Take a look at Chapters 10 and 13 for more information about 
helpful tools.)
 Behavioral: Challenging behaviors are often one of the greatest con-
cerns of people in the community. You need to know the behaviors well
in order to successfully navigate around activities and events containing
antecedents to challenging behaviors.
Like with employment situations, neurotypical people involved in com-
munity activities need to know that you’ll provide support to handle 
any challenging behaviors and that you don’t expect them to interact or
intervene in challenging situations.

For Adults with Autism: Fostering
Friendships and Romantic
Relationships
In This Chapter
 Establishing and nurturing relationships
 Stepping foot into the dating world
 Achieving the highest level of intimacy
 Helping caregivers give relationship support
I
n general, our culture has three levels of close acquaintance: friendships,
romantic relationships, and sexual relationships. All three levels are chal-
lenging for everyone, but they can be even more challenging for you, a person
with autism. You have to work that much harder to make and maintain true
friendships due to your differences (both because of your needs and others’).
But don’t be discouraged. You’ll find that all your work will pay off when you
make friendships and (hopefully) find love.
In this chapter, we explore some ideas on how to help you succeed in areas
that are extremely important in establishing relationships. We help you figure
out how to make friends, and we identify the prerequisites for maintaining
friendship with the possibility of it deepening into an intimate relationship.
We show you the ropes on how to start dating. Finally, we discuss moving 
on to a sexual relationship when you and your love interest are ready and
willing.
As a bonus in this chapter, we provide information in each section to help
caregivers educate their dependents on the topics of friendship and intimacy.
Some people on the autism spectrum aren’t able to maintain relationships
without some help, and we want you to be as prepared as possible to assist
them. We also provide dating and sex-education information so you can help
the person with autism in your life find love.

Developing Friendly Relationships
People in a friendly relationship share one or more common interests as a
bond. With most people, this friendship develops through socially oriented
gatherings that initially emphasize unrelated small talk about the weather,
bosses, coworkers, and so on. These surface conversations can develop into
meaningful discussions about common interests after the people involved
establish a degree of mutual comfort.
But for you, a person on the autism spectrum, developing friendships can be
difficult as you struggle with understanding the fine points of social commu-
nication. Many people on the autism spectrum have difficulty with pragmatics
(using language in its proper social context), nonverbal communication (such
as body language), and subtle social interaction. However, by using tactics
such as watching modeled appropriate social communication and studying
the specific social cues that others readily pick up without intense study, you
can become familiar with the expectations of friendly relationships and gain
the confidence to actively pursue friendships. We show you the way in this
section.
Although it may be more difficult for persons with autism to make friends,
the friendships autistic individuals make are strong relationships based on
honesty and trust. A person who befriends an individual with autism must be
an understanding person who isn’t afraid to relate to people who other more
shallow people may avoid.
Understanding the circle of relationships
Being aware of the different types of relationships is important for people
both on and off the autism spectrum because failing to understand the nature
of your relationship with another person can lead to uncomfortable situations
and hurt feelings. Most persons off the spectrum learn the rules of social inter-
actions through observation, but as a person on the spectrum, you may not
be able to glean the rules through observation alone due to a possible impair-
ment of interpreting non-autistic spectrum social skills — a hallmark of
autism. What you need is direct instruction. Take a look at Figure 15-1 to see
how you can group different categories of relationships, and check out the 
following list, which outlines some of the different types of relationships,
ordered from the most distant to the most intimate:
 Stranger: This group is made up of people you’ve never spoken to and
very rarely see. Examples: A waitress at a restaurant, a person sitting in
a park, fellow commuters to the workplace.
302
Part IV: Living with Autism as an Adult 

 Acquaintance: You see these people more regularly, but you have the
opportunity to make small talk on a strictly irregular basis. Examples:
Neighbors, some classmates, some coworkers.
 Friend: You’ve known these people for a while. You talk about personal
things, and you go to events that involve common interests (see Chapter
14 for some examples of these events). Some friendships can become
very deep. You and your friends may tease each other, but you don’t
make fun of each other or cause any harm. Examples: Neighbors, class-
mates, or coworkers who you’ve established relationships with and
people you meet through common interests.
 Family and significant others: You have the closest bond with these
people, and you usually spend the most time with them while growing
up. Examples: mom, dad, siblings, boyfriend, girlfriend, fiancé, spouse
(most people make a shift toward the latter four as adults; see the fol-
lowing sections in this chapter).

Making first contact
The more people you meet, the more likely you are to make friends. But you
can’t always wait for another person to initiate the relationship. You shouldn’t
be afraid to make first contact when you feel comfortable with a situation.
The following sections give you tips on how to make the first contact and
generate small talk and where to go from there.
Engaging in small talk
When making first contact with a person you’re interested in becoming closer
to, try to make small talk as much as possible. You can always ask a person
how he or she is doing. Other common topics of small talk can include a dis-
cussion of the weather or about how work/school has been going. When
making small talk, follow these tips to keep the other party interested:
 Always try to make some eye contact and look interested in what the
person is saying.
 Smile when someone else smiles at you.
 Don’t get upset if the small talk ends and the person walks away; you
don’t want to force someone to continue to talk when he or she wants to
move on and do something else.
If your friendship is meant to be, the other person will show interest in talk-
ing with you. The key part of any relationship is what “friend” means. A friend
is someone who shows genuine interest in you and what you have to say. All
you can do is make the effort to try to begin talking with someone and see
what happens from there.
You may have difficulty talking to someone new for the first time because
people on the autism spectrum tend to have great difficulty with the small-
talk stage and commonly jump right into discussions about interests. The key
is to figure out when this type of conversation is appropriate. You can feel
more comfortable jumping right into common interests at clubs and other
gatherings based on an interest or passion. At work or school, you may
decide to discuss common interests only after someone else brings up a
topic you’re interested in. This way, you make sure that you’re not just inject-
ing your own interests into conversations when others may not want to talk
about what you enjoy. Be careful, though, not to dominate the discussion of
mutual interests. Give those around you a chance to get word in.
When meeting new people, many businesspeople record a few facts about
those people for future conversational material. Try this tip as you meet 
new people.
304
Part IV: Living with Autism as an Adult 

The initial stage of talking to others in order to make friends may not be the
best time to disclose your autism. You may just want to act as you naturally
do, and if you come off as “different” to others, the others must decide if
they’re accepting of who you really are, regardless of diagnosis.
Settings for making (or moving on from) first contact
The following list gives you some suggestions on increasing your circulation
within your community. You can follow these bits of advice after you make
first contact with an acquaintance, or you can make first contact during one
of these activities.
 Get involved with activity-based clubs and groups. People on the
autism spectrum tend to fare better in activity-based events (such as at
a bicycle club gathering, a computer-user group, or on a nature walk)
rather than at socially oriented gatherings (office parties, family
reunions, bars, and so on). Activity-based events provide a structure in
which you can practice social interaction and form friendships. You can
become comfortable in the group setting by participating in the struc-
tured activity before much interaction has to take place.
Ask neighbors, classmates, or coworkers what group activities they’re
involved in. You may be able to join groups with someone you know,
thus limiting the initial stress associated with being a new person in a
group. Asking people you’re acquainted with what they enjoy doing out-
side of work or the classroom helps to build rapport and can lead to
enriching group-based activities you can partake in.
 Invite others to join you for specific, structured activities. Find out if
neighbors or classmates enjoy activities you’re comfortable with, such
as playing a computer game, bicycle riding, or other passions you have.
The interaction will be more successful than having someone over to
just “hang around.” (See Chapter 14 for some other activity tips.)
Avoid activities that may present you with sensory issues. If you have
trouble with loud noises and crowds, for example, you should avoid
meeting potential friends at loud, crowded concerts. (For more on
common sensory issues, see Chapter 10.)
 Volunteer to work with older or younger groups of people. People with
autism often get along better with persons of other age groups. Younger
people have less-sophisticated requirements for their interactions, and
older people often have the patience to help scaffold (or structure) an
interaction.
305
Chapter 15: Fostering Friendships and Romantic Relationships

For caregivers: Helping your dependent
establish friendships
Helping a person on the autism spectrum make and maintain friendships can
be difficult, but it isn’t impossible. And if the person you care for is willing to
go out and meet people, you should be willing to do whatever it takes to help
(and willing to motivate if the person is a bit hesitant). If the person you care
for is low functioning and has trouble getting out and meeting people, you
can still support him in trying to socially interact with the people he sees on
a regular basis. Here are a few ways to get your dependent started:
 Find activity-based events to attend. Help your child find groups he
may want to join based on his special interests, like a science club or a
jogging club. You can also arrange for social time with neighbors or
classmates who have similar interests.
Try to use connections with local autism support groups as a way to get
information about other parents/caregivers interested in finding social
groups for the person with autism they care for.
 Help him to be a good friend. You can help him understand the subtle
nuances of communication that people off the autism spectrum take for
granted. Here are a couple notes for caregivers (see the section “The
most important part of boyfriend or girlfriend is ‘friend’” for more tips):
• Set up a hygiene schedule. Some people with autism may not rec-
ognize their “ripe” smells and the need for a shower. Others may
be overly sensitive to the use of a washcloth and certain soaps —
especially the scented variety. Setting up a visual or word-based
schedule for hygienic activities is helpful. You should also find
cleaning products that aren’t overwhelming to the senses of the
autistic person.
• Show him how to have agreeable disagreements. Disagreeing
need not be a blood sport. It may be helpful to develop a social
story or Power Card that describes what to do when a disagree-
ment occurs. (See Chapter 13 for more details on these tools.)
 Explain the concept of “appropriate touching.” Use the circle of rela-
tionships diagram in Figure 15-1 to help determine developmentally
appropriate types of touch. For example, a 4-year-old child hugging
everyone he sees is cute. When a 24-year-old does the hugging, however,
it has different meanings. Teaching the person to substitute handshaking
for hugging will serve him later on in life.
For further information on helping people with autism increase their time
spent in the community to develop friends and relationships, check out
Teresa Bolick’s book Asperger Syndrome and Adolescence: Helping Preteens
and Teens Get Ready for the Real World (Fair Winds Press).

Recognizing (And Overcoming) 
the Challenges of Dating
The second level of friendship introduces the sometimes uncomfortable but
definitely enjoyable level of intimacy into a relationship. The sheer number of
books on dating indicates that intimacy can be challenging for many people,
including you. Some of your major challenges likely stem from your ability (or
inability) to express the subtle verbal and nonverbal types of communication
that indicate a person’s desire to have a relationship with another person. You
also may have trouble determining what level of relationship another person
desires. Don’t worry, it isn’t just you; most people on the autism spectrum
have difficulty perceiving and accurately decoding these cues.
For people on the autism spectrum, the greatest success in dating comes by
first looking for a friend (see the previous section). If you discover sufficient
compatibility with a person, perhaps you can move on to an intimate rela-
tionship that stems from your friendship. This section helps you take the
next step, if you so desire.
The challenges posed by a lack of interpersonal skills in people with autism
make it even more important that a good friendship precede any attempt to
go on a date. Deepening the relationship with another person by engaging in
more activities of common interests, actively listening to the other person,
and sharing your needs and desires makes it easier when the time comes to
let the other person know of your interest in dating.
Asking for a date
You may have issues that neurotypical people don’t face, such as difficulty
understanding body language and other nonverbal cues, but you share some-
thing in common with every other adult interested in dating: You get ner-
vous. You can minimize much of the challenge that comes with asking a
person out for a date by not actually using the emotionally charged word
“date.” Think of dating as an extension of engaging in an activity with a friend
or a person who you would like to get to know better as a friend (a task made
easier if you get to know the person before you ask him or her out on a date).
The request can be as simple as asking the other person if he or she would
like to go out for a movie, get a snack or meal, meet for coffee, or engage in
another activity of interest.
You can ask the other person on a date face-to-face or via the phone, e-mail,
or other form of communication. Keep your communication brief and to the
point. Using e-mail or instant messaging may be easier for you because you
face no distractions from attempting to decode nonverbal communication.
Asking in person or on the phone is usually faster, however. It may be wise to
307
Chapter 15: Fostering Friendships and Romantic Relationships

avoid using chat rooms to ask people out on dates because the people you
chat with may not be people you know very well. Try to avoid randomly
asking people out on dates if you haven’t met them and hardly know them.
Simple is best. A sample telephone or Internet conversation could go like this:
Lovely Lady: Hello?
You: Hi! This is Jimmy Peterson. How are you?
Lovely Lady: I am fine. And you?
You: I am good. There’s a great concert this weekend at the Centrum, and I
would like to go. Would you like to go with me?
Lovely Lady: Sure! When is the concert?
You: The concert is at 7 p.m. this Friday.
At this point, you make plans to meet at an agreeable place, set up a time,
and so on. Now, suppose the response is negative, indicating that the person
is busy. Here’s a possible response:
Handsome Hunk: I would like to, but I’m unable to go.
You: Well, it was nice talking to. See you in school (if you go to the same
school).

Dating tip: Don’t confuse a girlfriend 
with a squeeze machine
I (co-author Stephen Shore) am not sure I can
consider this story as a dating experience,
which I suppose is part of the problem. After
spending a good amount of time over several
weeks with a woman in college, I found out that
she really liked hugs and backrubs. I was
elated!
Now, in the non-autistic world, this preference
was a code indicating that she wanted to have
a more intimate relationship. But my autistic
interpretation was that I had a friend who 
also doubled as a Temple Grandin–type deep-
pressure-squeeze machine (a device developed
by Temple Grandin to provide the deep pressure
her body craved). After several weeks, she
invited me to her house to sleep over. And that’s
exactly what I did, slept — even in the same bed
with her.
Soon, she seemed very frustrated and was
crying. It took a lot of talking for me to realize
that not only did she want to be my girlfriend,
but also she thought we had been dating steady
for at least a month or two!
I never perceived her nonverbal communica-
tions indicating that she wanted to be my girl-
friend. Fortunately for me, I no longer need to
worry about how to date, because I’ve been
married for over 16 years.

Many requests for dates do get turned down, so if it happens to you, you’re in
good company. The other person may truly be busy, or he or she may just
not want to hurt your feelings by rejecting your offer. Don’t get down about it.
Remember, the other person is missing out on spending time with you!
You should follow the three-strikes rule, which states that you can ask the
other person out on a date (nicely) a total of three times. If the “Nos” add up
to three, you should assume that the person doesn’t want to date you, and
you need to leave him or her alone. To do otherwise invites the possibility of
being accused of stalking or harassment.
Behaving appropriately during the date
Congratulations on the accepted date offer! When you go on your date, make
sure you enjoy yourself and go slow. You’re likely nervous. The other person
is probably just as nervous as you are. Try to kick off a date by starting con-
versation about topics both of you share mutual interest in to lower the
inevitable stress level (see the section “Engaging in small talk” earlier in this
chapter). If things are going well, you may want to gently take your compan-
ion’s hand while you make conversation or enjoy a movie to show your affec-
tion. Observe how the other person responds. If he or she holds on to your
hand as well, you know that things are moving along. If your companion pulls
away, he or she isn’t ready for a closer relationship. That may be as far as
you want to go for a first date.
On the other hand (no pun intended), the person you’re dating may hold his
or her hand out to you. If you’re comfortable taking that hand to hold, you
can do so. If you’re not ready to hold hands at that time, or if holding hands
causes you unbearable sensory issues (see Chapter 10), feel free to say so in
a simple manner. “I would rather not hold hands at this time.” You can use a
sentence like this for any activity, such as kissing, hugging, or sex, if you just
don’t feel ready.
If things continue to go well on your date, and you both agree to go on
another date, repeating the handholding may be a good idea. If the handhold-
ing goes well the second time around, you may want to go further. Strongly
consider asking for permission before you move on to kissing, petting, and
sex. It may not seem very romantic, but given the challenges you may face in
nonverbal communication, it’s better to be safe than sorry. (For more infor-
mation about sex and autism, see the section “Taking It to the Next Level with
Sexual Behavior” later in this chapter.)
If you plan on going out alone on a date, make sure you feel comfortable
being alone with the person. If you go out with someone you may not be com-
fortable with alone, consider having someone you know and trust come along
with you on the first date or try to arrange a double date, where you go on
the date with another couple. Double dates can ease the stress associated
with being alone with someone.

Chapter 15: Fostering Friendships and Romantic Relationships

Opting for full or no disclosure
Making the decision to disclose your autism to a date is an important one. We
feel that you should keep your autism spectrum disorder on a “need-to-know
basis.” And just when is that time? When the effects of being autistic signifi-
cantly impact a relationship and you feel a need for better mutual under-
standing and trust (usually after a number of dates when your bond is
growing stronger), you should disclose your condition at your discretion.
One good way to disclose your condition is to use the following four steps:
1. Talk about your strengths and challenges.
Take time to discuss possible things you struggle with, such as social
conversation, sensory issues, or issues of repetitive behavior. Couple
that with a discussion of your strengths, which may include having a
good memory, being a good worker, or being a kind person.
2. Sort your strengths and challenges out in terms of how you possibly
use your strengths to work through some challenges.
Explain how you try to compensate for your struggles by emphasizing
your strengths. For example, you could talk about how you use your
memory strength to keep track of what people are interested in so you
can have introductory topics to discuss. This activity compensates for
your troubles in starting up new conversation.

Part IV: Living with Autism as an Adult 
How do I tell if we are boyfriend/girlfriend?
Determining the exact stage of intimate rela-
tions can be confusing for everyone. However,
because of my autistic tendencies, I (co-author
Stephen Shore) could never accurately decode
when a relationship was at a particular stage.
By the time I met the girl who would become my
wife, I had devised my own social narrative to
help me realize when I had reached the intimate
stage.
Essentially, I decided that if a woman displayed
the three behaviors of hugging, kissing, and ini-
tiating handholding, she wanted to be my girl-
friend. At that point, my response would be one
of the following: yes, no, or I need further inves-
tigation and analysis.
My wife and I have recently celebrated our 16th
wedding anniversary, so I reckon that “yes”
was the right answer. I was lucky because no
person tried to take advantage of my lack of
knowledge in the area of intimate relations.
Well, some persons may have, but my total lack
of awareness may have protected me in what
could’ve been a dangerous situation.
The good news is that you can overcome the
challenges of relationship classification with
open and direct communication about relation-
ships, dating, and sexuality. Using the informa-
tion in this chapter, along with the other sources
we mention, you can learn how to develop safe
and fulfilling relationships with others both on
and off the autism spectrum!

3. Bring the conversation toward other successful persons with your 
set of characteristics. You can also mention people with differing 
characteristics.
For example, you can mention Temple Grandin, an autistic woman who
emphasized her strengths and was able to get a PhD, find a good job,
and even write books about what she overcame. You can even throw out
Thomas Jefferson’s name — the founding father is theorized to have had
Asperger Syndrome (see Chapter 5 for more on this type of autism).
4. Trot out the label.
As an introduction, you may want to mention that scientists, educators,
and others are studying people with varying characteristics, and it just
so happens that your characteristics line up with (insert your label here).
Each disclosure situation is different. It may be possible to get through the 4
Steps in 10 to 15 minutes, or it could take a number of days or possibly
longer. You can also choose to make a partial disclosure if you aren’t ready
for full disclosure. In this case, you can mention the specific area where a
characteristic of autism may be affecting the situation. For example, you may
ask to leave a room lit with fluorescent lights because “I have sensitive eyes.”
Try to be confident when you attempt disclosure. Remember, you’re describ-
ing to someone who you are. If the person gets upset about who you are, he
or she isn’t the kind of person you want to be intimate with.
One way you can “prime” the disclosure discussion is to give the person
you’re dating an autobiography of a person with autism that best resembles
your situation. You can find many good autobiographies on people with
autism. We recommend that you read any of Temple Grandin’s books. She
always talks clearly about the struggles and rewards of coping with autism.
For caregivers: Moving on to dating
Entering the dating world is an anxiety-producing process, and people with
autism are no exception. The person in your life with autism may experience
rejection, feel like an outsider, or just feel different from her peers, and situa-
tions in adolescence and dating often bring out those feelings even more
intensely. When the person in your life is ready to move from a friendship to
a romantic relationship, you can help her succeed by answering questions,
initiating discussions, and being generally supportive. Some low-functioning
children on the spectrum may not be able to understand dating or romantic
relationships. If you care for a low-functioning person, you must realize that
friendships can still occur, but a friend doesn’t necessarily have to be a
boyfriend or girlfriend. For high-functioning individuals who demonstrate an
understanding of dating and a desire to date, here are a few of our favorite
tips for caregivers:
311
Chapter 15: Fostering Friendships and Romantic Relationships

 Be a sounding board. Give her the chance to try out that first telephone
invitation (see the section “Asking for a date”).
 Discuss appropriate behavior for the date (see the section “Behaving
appropriately during the date”).
 Role-play certain dating situations, such as conversations at dinner or
the movies, and discuss any confusing areas.
Make sure that the person with autism doesn’t confuse your supportive
role-playing identity with actual dating. Also, you should discuss the
physical aspects of situations rather than the actual physical contact.
Physical contact in a role-playing situation is very confusing to people
with autism (and those without) and may be damaging (and illegal).
 Conduct “touching” discussions about appropriate actions and receiving
touch from others. Some points of discussion include the following:
• If you don’t want someone touching you in a certain place, you
shouldn’t touch another person in that place.
• The person with autism should have a “safe person” she can dis-
cuss any concerns with. She should see the “safe person” as some-
one who wants to help her rather than punish her.
• Encourage self-advocacy before your loved one begins dating.
Being aware of one’s comfort level and letting others know in a way
they can understand requires skills in appropriate self-advocacy.
A person with autism should know that some persons, such as doctors or
nurses, may have to touch parts of her body without permission. Make sure
she doesn’t confuse this behavior with sexual behavior.
Taking It to the Next Level 
with Sexual Behavior
Intimate relations can be challenging for you, a person on the autism spec-
trum, because you run into plenty of unspoken expectations that most
people seem to understand without discussion. Confusion with nonverbal
cues can be comical, such as when someone yawns and you think the person
is choking and pound on her back to help her breath, or it can be harmful,
such as when a person doesn’t understand the need to stop a behavior. To
address this challenge, we recommend you take time to review some impor-
tant aspects of the hidden curriculum for developing intimate relationships.
Hidden curriculum is a term used to describe social information that everyone
knows, but no one is taught. For more about hidden curriculum, see Chapter
5. For now, go through the following sections to discover more about the
hidden curriculum through the scope of engaging in sexual behavior as an
autistic adult.

Part IV: Living with Autism as an Adult 

The most important part of boyfriend 
or girlfriend is “friend”
No set of rules governs how long you have to know a person before you try to
cultivate a boy/girlfriend relationship. Acquiring a boy/girlfriend may occur
after you’ve known the person as only a friend for some time. As a person
with autism, it may be easier for you to develop boy/girlfriend relationships
with people you’re already comfortable with as friends. On the other hand,
you may meet someone for the first time and know right away you want him
or her to be your boy/girlfriend. In either situation, the most important part
of the boyfriend or girlfriend relationship is being a “friend.”
Teresa Bolick, a psychologist specializing in helping children and young
adults on the autism spectrum, has some pointers for developing and main-
taining the most important prerequisite to intimate relations — friendship.
These tips describe some of the most vital components of being a good
friend and, in turn, boy/girlfriend. Here are the tips:
 Listen as carefully as you can. People like to be listened to, and listen-
ing is a vital skill in being able to relate to others. Two of the key indica-
tors you can use to ensure that your significant other knows you’re
listening are eye contact and the turning of your body toward the person
talking. You may need some direct instruction in this area to demon-
strate that you’re paying attention.
You may find eye contact difficult or impossible. Many people on the
autism spectrum who can make eye contact report that they don’t
receive any useful information for their efforts. For this reason, we rec-
ommend that if eye contact is difficult, look in the vicinity of the other
person’s eyes. For instance, you can focus on the person’s nose, mouth,
or forehead areas.
 Practice proper hygiene. Set a schedule to take care of basic personal
hygiene needs, and stick to it. Even if you don’t notice your breath or
body odor, others may, including your love interest.
If you’re turned off by smells coming from your significant other, you
need to first classify the smells. You should say nothing if you think she
doesn’t intend to smell that way (if she has body odor, for example). If
you think she chooses to smell that way and it bothers you (she wears
strong perfume, for example), you should explain nicely that the smell
bothers you.
Sensory issues often play a large part in the lives of people with autism.
If you’re overly sensitive to smells, you should find a mild, scent-free
soap that works for you. If you’re particularly sensitive to the feel of
loofahs or washcloths, experiment with different materials, including
soft linens found in the baby departments of stores, to find something
313
Chapter 15: Fostering Friendships and Romantic Relationships

that works for you. It’s also possible to wash yourself clean by using
only your hands. (Co-author Stephen Shore has a beard because shaving
feels like a power sander scraping across his face.)
 Share life experiences and feelings. This step is vital for moving from
the acquaintance and friendship stages to the significant-other stage. In
short, you develop and accumulate experience-sharing interactions by
spending time together.
 Shoot for agreeable disagreements. All people disagree from time to
time, but you have to find a way to respectfully disagree. Look for ways
to respect the person and treat her kindly, even if you don’t agree with
her point of view.
 Friendship counts. Research shows that the most successful long-term,
intimate relationships are between people who are friends first. Place a
premium on friendship instead of rushing to the physical aspects of a
relationship.
 Show interest. People are flattered when you ask them questions about
how they like to spend their time, what hobbies they enjoy, and what
thoughts they have about current events. Strive to have the other
person do more talking than you.
 Stay on an even keel. Being overexcited or “running on empty” interferes
with your efforts to make friends and develop intimate relationships.
 Stop means stop/No means no. In this case, the literal interpretation of
language by people on the autism spectrum is an asset. Many problems
occur when a person tries to second-guess the other person’s “no” as
being a tease or really meaning “yes” during discussions of intimacy. You
have to assume that if someone says “no,” he or she does mean “no.”
Engaging in sexual activity
If you and your significant other feel comfortable with the idea, sex can be a
wonderful way to express love and appreciation.
Sex by definition is a sensual experience. The hyper and hyposensitivity of
people with autism can affect their sexual activities. For example, hyposen-
sitivity can cause problems in obtaining necessary stimulation for achieving
orgasm. Others may find the experience of sex overstimulating. Tactile sensitiv-
ities may require wearing clothing on some parts of the body while engaging in
sexual activities. (For more on dealing with sensory issues, see Chapter 10.)
If the other person doesn’t want to have sex, you must immediately stop.
Although it may not seem fair, anytime the other person wants to stop hold-
ing hands, kissing, petting, making out, or having sex, you must immediately
cease. To do otherwise invites a charge of sexual assault! You also need to be
familiar with the appropriate contraception devices you can use to avoid the
life-changing effects of unintended pregnancy.
314
Part IV: Living with Autism as an Adult 

Sexual experience isn’t limited to sexual activity with another person. You
can also sexually gratify yourself with self-touching, often referred to as mas-
turbation. Masturbation is an activity you should keep private, just as you
keep sexual activity with another person private. Touching yourself in sexu-
ally stimulating ways around other people can make them very uncomfort-
able, and, more importantly, doing so is against the law. If you want to
experience sexual activity by touching yourself, find a private place to do so
where others can’t see you.
For caregivers: Exploring sex education 
for people with autism
Maybe you’ve heard the myth that people on the autism spectrum aren’t
interested in intimate relationships and sex. Visiting an Asperger support
group (which tend to be predominantly male) and watching what happens
when a female with Asperger Syndrome walks in can quickly dispel this myth.
Maybe people just don’t want to admit, because of societal taboos, that folks
on the autism spectrum — especially those who can’t self-report — have
sexual function. But sex is a basic need integral to all persons. Sexuality influ-
ences thoughts, feelings, actions, and interactions. It affects mental and phys-
ical health. And intercourse is but a small part of sexuality. Just as with the
rest of the human population, people with autism are interested in intimate
relations and sex to varying degrees.
Some research indicates that 81 percent of adults with autism ages 16-40
demonstrate some signs of sexual interest. Unfortunately, perhaps due to a
lack of or improper education on the topic, a third engage in masturbation in
public areas, and close to half use objects in connection with this activity.
Masturbation is especially prevalent (and problematic) in low-functioning
persons on the spectrum, who may only express their sexual urges through
masturbation. Persons on this end of the spectrum often have the least
understanding of socially acceptable behavior, including where and when
masturbation can be appropriate.
Some experts observe that most learners with developmental disabilities
receive sexuality education only after having engaged in some behaviors that
are considered inappropriate, offensive, or potentially dangerous. Waiting to
address the issue of sexual education for autistic persons is somewhat akin
to closing the barn door after the horse has run.
One complicating factor in the sexual education of people on the autism
spectrum is that social differences, between those on and off the spectrum,
eliminate a primary information source in this area — other peers not on the
autism spectrum. Therefore, people on the spectrum often don’t get the
normal information (or they get misinformation, in some cases) about sex
from non-spectrum peers.
315
Chapter 15: Fostering Friendships and Romantic Relationships

Therefore, it’s up to you, the caregiver, to educate your dependent on mat-
ters of sex. Providing education about sex won’t likely change the amount of
sexual activity a person with autism has. What it will do, though, is allow him
or her to direct sexual urges more appropriately. Use the advice in the follow-
ing pages to channel your child’s sexual energy so he or she can live a full
and happy sexual life.
If the person under your care has difficulty successfully interacting with his
environment (sometimes referred to as low-functioning), it can be even more
beneficial to offer sex education. Even if he has difficulty communicating and
otherwise successfully interacting with his environment, he has sexual urges.
If you don’t provide the proper education, he will satisfy his urges in some
way, which may be less than desirable, or he may become very frustrated.
Don’t skip this important topic for people on this end of the spectrum.
Teaching about sex and managing behavior
Because the education that non-spectrum people get from peers, the media,
and others tends to be missing for people on the autism spectrum, direct
instruction is very important. Teaching a person with autism about sex is like
teaching any other subject: You need to make accommodations for the abili-
ties and learning style of the person on the autism spectrum (see Chapter 11).
You can manage inappropriate actions such as masturbation in public areas
like any other challenging behavior.
Lynn Mitchell of the Cody Center identifies these important considerations
and concepts when teaching people on the spectrum about sex:
 Think ahead and be proactive. Address sexually related challenges that
your child may face as he enters adulthood — ideally, before they occur.
Some of these issues include masturbation, sexual abuse, personal
safety, and sexually transmitted diseases. You should also consider
reproductive topics such as pregnancy, childbirth, and parenthood.
316
Part IV: Living with Autism as an Adult 
People on the spectrum talk about sex
One of the best ways to gain insight on how
people with autism feel about intimate relation-
ships and sex is through firsthand accounts.
Two groundbreaking books, written by people
on the autism spectrum, are Autism-Asperger’s
and Sexuality, by Jerry and Mary Newport
(Future Horizons), and Sex, Sexuality and the
Autism Spectrum, by Wendy Lawson (Jessica
Kingsley Publishers). These books are easy to
understand and chockfull of useful and impor-
tant advice.

When a high-functioning female with autism begins to menstruate and
show some sexual interests, she needs to know that sex can result in
pregnancy. You need to talk with your autistic adolescent or adult about
birth control measures if you think he or she may be interested in
becoming sexually involved with another person.
You can also discuss sexual orientation in an informative way. You
shouldn’t present the topic as if you want to make the person with
autism make a choice. Your goal is to inform the individual that some
people are attracted to individuals of the opposite sex, some are
attracted to both sexes, and others are attracted to the same sex.
 Adjust your teaching style. Most people with autism benefit from a con-
crete, calm, supportive, and serious manner. As with other areas of edu-
cation, you may need to educate in small manageable pieces of
information (see Chapter 11).
Most people with autism are visually oriented. As a result, having simple
diagrams and possibly three-dimensional models of both male and
female reproductive organs can be helpful. Local autism societies or
other organizations serving individuals may be able to hook you up with
materials that are useful for teaching sex education to individuals with
developmental disabilities.
 Topics to cover. Peter Gerhardt, president of the Organization for
Autism Research (www.researchautism.org), identifies ten central
concepts to cover in sex education:
• Public versus private behavior
• Good touch versus bad touch
• Proper names for body parts
• Slang names for body parts
• Personal boundaries
• Masturbation (see the following section, “Redirecting 
masturbation”)
• Social skills and relationship building (see the section “Developing
Friendly Relationships”)
• Avoiding danger and abuse prevention
• Dating skills (see the section “Recognizing [And Overcoming] the
Challenges of Dating”)
• Personal responsibilities and values
317
Chapter 15: Fostering Friendships and Romantic Relationships

Redirecting masturbation
Almost all people engage in masturbation, and people with autism are no
exception. Where the exception does pop up is in the appropriateness of the
act. Most people learn (from their peers, family, media, and their own obser-
vation) when masturbation is appropriate (and when it isn’t appropriate), but
persons with autism and other conditions may need more direct instruction.
Inappropriate masturbation is one of the more challenging behaviors some
people with autism present. Societal taboos about teaching how and when 
to masturbate add to these difficulties. Fortunately, after you get past the
taboos, you can manage masturbation just like any other behavior.
Here are some guidelines Peter Gerhardt, President of the Organization for
Autism Research (www.researchautism.org), suggests for redirecting 
this behavior for more appropriate situations:
 Interrupt the behavior as early in the chain as possible.
 Remind the individual about the appropriate parameters of time and
place.
 Redirect the person to
• An activity requiring the use of both hands. Reinforce the individ-
ual for appropriate discrimination or use of hands.
• An activity requiring preferred levels of attention, focus, or physi-
cal activity — in other words, another mutually exclusive behavior.
• The appropriate place for the activity. Consider scheduling “alone
time” in the person’s room if appropriate, and avoid redirection to
places other than an individual’s bedroom. Although the bathroom
may be a tempting target, what would happen if the individual con-
verts the behavior to bathrooms in other peoples’ homes and
other public locations?
These tips are good practices in redirecting any undesired behavior. Try the
strategies with other challenging behaviors.

Special-Needs Planning 
for the Future
In This Chapter

 Funding your at-home program
 Finding an attorney or planner
 Understanding why you need a will
W
e hate to be the bearers of bad news, but here it is: You’re going to die
someday. You, like all parents or guardians, have to plan for the likeli-
hood that your child will outlive you.
Many parents find planning for their autistic child’s special needs — for both
the present and the future — overwhelming or intimidating. You don’t know
what’s going to happen, so you decide to wait and see. Before you know it,
the weeks turn into months, and the months turn into years. One day you
may realize that time’s running out and you haven’t done anything.
Children grow up quickly. Many, many situations get in the way of special-
needs planning in the short term, and a perfect time to plan doesn’t exist.
Your best bet is to get started and adjust the details of your plan as time
passes. You won’t be sorry if you overplan, but you will be sorry if you wait
too long. If you don’t plan ahead, your child may end up with a minimal
income or be disqualified from government services entirely. Get started
soon, and you will be glad that you did.
In this chapter, we cover the decisions you need to make such as what to
leave your child in your will, who will be your child’s guardian after you are
gone, how to choose people to help you make the decisions, and how to
think about your child’s future care, supervision, security, and quality of life.
We wrote this chapter with help from some experts in financial planning, and
we try to address the most vexing questions.

Avoiding Common Financial Mistakes
We don’t want you to be caught up short by not having done everything you
can do financially for your child, so we asked Nadine Vogel, the mother of two
disabled children and founder of MetDesk, a division of MetLife Insurance
that helps parents with special-needs planning, to help you avoid the most
common financial mistakes parents make. Here’s what she told us:
 Not drafting documents properly. Many parents use otherwise compe-
tent financial professionals who don’t know about special-needs laws.
Professionals without this knowledge may make mistakes that can harm
your child’s financial future, such as drafting a will or life-insurance
policy incorrectly. You need an attorney who specializes in special-needs
planning to draft a will for your estate.
 Not coordinating your financial life. Parents or well-meaning relatives
may unknowingly make your child the beneficiary of investments, for
instance, that negatively affect your child’s benefit eligibility. See the
section “Keeping eligibility for government services in mind” in this
chapter.
 Not having enough information about laws impacting your child. For
example, parents may assume they’re automatically the guardians of
their 18- or 21-year-old child (your state determines the legal age limit),
when they haven’t actually gone through the legal procedure needed to
obtain legal guardianship. You don’t want to find out the hard way that
you can’t see your adult child’s medical results under current federal
law without the child’s written permission. Your lawyer or local disabili-
ties group should be able to help you with the laws in your state and
county.
And, of course, the biggest mistake of all is not planning, which is why you’re
reading this chapter. MetLife conducted a survey that found that 60 percent
of parents don’t expect their special-needs children to become financially
independent, yet the majority of parents hadn’t written a will. Don’t wait until
it’s too late! (For more info on drafting a will, see the section “Writing Your
Will” later in this chapter.)
Putting Plan to Paper: Getting Started
To make decisions about your child’s future, you’ll need to think about sev-
eral issues we discuss in this section, including his earning abilities and your
financial situation. If you spend some time thinking about these issues ini-
tially, you will be better able to focus your planning. Ask yourself the follow-
ing four questions:
320
Part IV: Living with Autism as an Adult 

 What’s my child’s prognosis to be able to support himself and manage
his financial affairs? What’s his earning potential?
 What government benefits does he receive now, and what is he eligible
to receive?
 How am I doing, financially?
 What is the best living environment for my child?
The answers to these questions will help you to determine what will be in
your will or family trust, whether your child will use government assistance,
and who will take care of him after you are no longer able to.
Taking account of your child’s prognosis
In order to plan for your family’s financial future, you have to think about
your child’s prognosis. This task is difficult, especially if your child is young.
Maybe your child will be much more independent than you can ever imagine,
in which case you’ll be happy to toss out these plans. You can start planning
for college, in that event. On the other end of the spectrum, your child may
need constant care and attention, in which case your planning may make all
the difference. The best course of action is to be conservative right now and
plan for the worst-case scenario. A professional evaluation may be necessary
for younger children because you don’t have objectivity. For adult children,
you’re probably aware of what he or she can do.
Now consider his or her earning potential. Can your child contribute finan-
cially, and if so, how much? Is he or she self-supporting at the present time, or
can you envision such a scenario? Even if your son or daughter is employed,
his or her job may not cover all the necessary living expenses.
In addition, although the person may be self-sufficient in personal care and
the ability to work and earn an income, many people with special needs are
easily influenced and manipulated. They may have difficulties with simple
money and budget matters requiring assistance.
Don’t forget college. Your child may wind up going to college, even if you didn’t
expect that to happen. In that event, you want to ensure that the assets you
have allocated for planning can be transferred. Don’t automatically dismiss the
college option. This issue will continually creep up throughout the child’s
school career, so you need to be prepared for it.

Chapter 16: Special-Needs Planning for the Future

Keeping eligibility for government 
services in mind
State and federal benefits are available even if your child works, but many
parents of autistic children and adults with autism are unaware of these qual-
ifications. Government benefits can help your child while you’re alive as well
as after you’re gone.
Parents need to be mindful of eligibility requirements when financial plan-
ning, because a person with autism can lose his or her eligibility by inheriting
too much. (Such benefits are means-tested, meaning the government takes
into account your child’s income or assets.)
For example, the federal Supplemental Security Income program (SSI) and
Medicaid help pay for basic needs such as food, clothing, and medical care if
your child has less than $2,000 in assets. Another major government benefit
is the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) Social Security Survivor/
Retirement Benefit. If a parent dies, or becomes disabled and/or retires, the
person with autism may be eligible for cash benefits and Medicare. No means
test exists for these benefits, and some people qualify for SSI, SSA, Medicaid,
and Medicare simultaneously.
There are earned and unearned income caps that vary among the states for
various government programs. The person must qualify medically based on
his or her condition. IQ and previous employment are also considered for
some government programs. Child support and adoption subsidies over the
allowed limit can result in ineligibility or termination. Make sure you get the
details from your state’s government office.
Other government benefits such as Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)
don’t have financial eligibility requirements — regardless of what you leave
to your son or daughter. After your child qualifies, the Social-Security pay-
ments will keep coming.
A helpful government organization is NICHCY, or the National Dissemination
Center for Children with Disabilities (in case you’re wondering, the name
changed but the acronym didn’t). This organization provides information on
types of disabilities, research, and laws that apply to autism and other dis-
abilities. You can contact NICHCY in writing at P.O. Box 1492, Washington, DC,
20013, by phone at 800-695-0285, by fax at 202-884-8441, or online at
nichcy.org. You can download a host of government publications, in
English and Spanish, there for free. (See the “Writing Your Will” section later
in this chapter for more details about planning by the government’s rules.)

Part IV: Living with Autism as an Adult 

Sizing up your estate
You need to know what you have to provide for your child later. Maybe you
think “estate” is too grand a word for your paltry assets, but that’s the legal
term you hear when speaking with legal professionals. To size up your estate,
write down every asset that you own; you may be pleasantly surprised!
When listing your assets, don’t forget the following:
 Equity in your home and any other real estate
 Investments, such as stocks and bonds
 Pensions, annuities, IRAs, 401(k)s, and other retirement vehicles
 Appreciable art and antiques
 Life insurance policies that have a cash value
Considering living arrangements 
and guardianship
Where will your child live after you’re gone, and who will be her guardian?
Difficult as this prospect may be, you need to think about who will make the
best decisions for her. You should name this person (or people) in your will.
This key decision needs to be made immediately, because it greatly affects
your child’s future.
The guardianship decision means that you must consider the following: Who
will provide daily care and supervision? Who will monitor doctors’ visits,
diet, medication, and therapy? What experience do future care providers
have in caring for a person with autism? And who is qualified to attend the
Individualized Education Program (IEP) meeting (see Chapter 12 for more
about IEPs)? The “Designating guardianship” section later in this chapter 
provides more information about guardianship.
Involving an Attorney and/or 
Financial Planner
If you want to hire a professional to help with your family’s special-needs
planning, the best place to start is to make sure the person you choose has
some experience in this area. Special-needs law is a specialty area that even
an experienced trusts-and-estates attorney or seasoned financial planner may
not know.
323
Chapter 16: Special-Needs Planning for the Future

Most importantly, your advisors should never tell you what to do. They must
listen to what you want for your loved one now and in the future. Their job is
to fulfill your wishes through planning and document preparation. If anyone
starts telling you to do this and do that, the smartest thing you can do is
leave.
However, a growing number of specialists are entering the special-needs 
field — some even have personal experience with disabilities in their families.
The best way to contact a professional with experience in the field may be to
get a recommendation. Keep in mind, however, that planning is a team pro-
ject. No individual can do it all alone. Here are some ways to get recommen-
dations for professionals:
 Contact a local disabilities group to find someone familiar with special-
needs issues.
 Call your local bar association or other trade group.
 Ask other local parents for referrals.
 Ask your insurance company, investment advisor, or other financial ser-
vices company if it has services targeted for special-needs kids. MetLife,
for example, has MetDesk, which has a toll-free number on its Web site
(www.MetLife.com; choose the link for Individuals, and then click on
Special Needs Planning). This organization gives free referrals to special-
needs attorneys, support groups, and local disability advocates.
When you contact a professional, ask questions about his or her experience
and philosophy, and don’t feel that you’re obligated to hire anyone whom you
interview. Also, don’t overlook the nonfinancial aspects of the prospective
relationship. This kind of business relationship, where family members are
involved, can present emotional decisions that require more than technical
expertise. If the person is inexpensive but insensitive, you may find dealing
with him too stressful to be worth the savings.
Here’s what you can look for when interviewing prospective planning 
professionals:
 Experience in working with special-needs families. If you find the pro-
fessional through a recommendation, you may already have this infor-
mation. You may be able to find somebody new to this area who could
work out fine, but why take a chance?
 Expertise. To do financial planning legally, no specific paper credential
is required. Designations you may see are CPA, JD, MBA, CFP (Certified
Financial Planner), but the most important expertise is familiarity with
federal, state, and county laws regarding disabilities. The laws change
frequently, and you need someone who’s caught up.
324
Part IV: Living with Autism as an Adult 

There is one professional designation that signifies extensive expertise
specifically in special-needs planning. The designation is Chartered
Lifetime Assistance Planner (ChLAP), which is awarded to graduates of
the National Center on Life Planning (NCLP), a nonprofit organization in
Northridge, California, that provides planning services and has estab-
lished a national training program and resource center for attorneys and
other professional advisors on the subject of special-needs planning.
 Communication skills. Your lawyer/planner should be able to explain
the laws and financial terminology in layman’s terms, respectfully and
not condescendingly, so that you know exactly what she’s doing. It’s
your money! If you can’t communicate well with the person, you should
move on.
 Personal sensitivity and tact. The decisions you make about your child
are fraught with emotional issues, and you need somebody who under-
stands that and can deal with it.
 Accessibility. Who do you want doing the actual work: the person you
interview or an intern? Does the person have a policy on returning
phone calls? What about e-mail?
One other consideration is price. Ask the attorney/planner to estimate her
fee in writing. If you think the fee is in line with the amount of work she’ll be
doing and what you expect to pay, good. If the fee sounds like more than you
can afford, find out how reasonable it really is. But this is not the time to
shop for a bargain. Choose your planner based on ability, not the fee. Fees
are often negotiable, or you can ask to work out a payment plan. Most profes-
sionals who work with special-needs families know they face financial pres-
sures and are more than willing to work with you. Also consider how the
advisor is being compensated. Is the service being provided based on a fee,
sale of product, or both? You need to know up front how it will work.
When working with a team of advisors (attorney, tax consultant, financial
advisor), have a planning agreement prepared by each team member specifi-
cally stating the services to be provided and the cost before you commit.
Some planners may take credit cards as a convenient option. If your child is
on SSI or SSA programs, you may use these funds to pay fees.
Writing Your Will
If you have a child or close relative with autism, you need a will . . . it’s that
simple. Why, you ask? If you die intestate (or without a will), your state’s laws
determine where your assets go, and you don’t want the government making
such important decisions for you!
325
Chapter 16: Special-Needs Planning for the Future

Although the laws vary from state to state, they generally mandate that all of
your assets go to the surviving spouse. If there is no surviving spouse, then it
goes to all surviving children in equal shares. Creating a will (or a living trust)
that allocates your assets is the only way to be sure that all your family mem-
bers distribute your assets in the manner that you decide.
You can always change or revoke your will before your death if circumstances
change. Make the best decision you can with the information you have now.
Being safe is better than doing nothing. Also, as your attorney will remind you,
be aware that your will doesn’t control all your assets. Items such as life insur-
ance (with your spouse as beneficiary) and joint property go to your spouse
upon your death, no matter what your will says. Additionally, investment vehi-
cles such as IRAs, 401(k)s, and annuities pass by beneficiary designation and
must be changed. You don’t want your child to receive a direct death benefit
payment after both of his parents have died.
Also, make sure grandparents’ wills aren’t drafted in such a way that the
grandchild with autism could receive an inheritance. This situation could
happen if the parent dies before his parents (the grandparents of the 
autistic child).
We recommend that you hire a professional attorney to prepare your will. Wills
are a technical subject, and creating a will isn’t a do-it-yourself proposition. The
advice we give you in this section is general advice, not legal advice, but it
should help get you going in the right direction.
Setting up a special-needs trust
Many parents set up a special-needs trust in their will to make sure their
child has money for recreation, travel, and education while maintaining his
right to federal assistance if anything happens to you. If dividing your assets
amongst your children affects your autistic child’s ability to receive benefits,
you leave your child out in the cold after you’re gone.
The information we provide in this section is for you if you decide not to will
your money to your disabled child. The special-needs trust is designed to
keep his assets safe. You need a lawyer, qualified paralegal, or legal document
preparer to draw up this trust. The person who prepares your will should
know how to do this.
Deciding if a special-needs trust is right for your child
If your autistic child can manage her own finances, you need to determine
whether she may one day need to depend on government benefits such as
Supplemental Security Insurance (SSI), subsidized housing, personal atten-
dant care, or Medicaid. You need to think long-term. If you think she may
need these types of services, a trust may be the way to go.
326
Part IV: Living with Autism as an Adult 

Special-needs trusts come in different forms. Evaluate whether you are get-
ting the correct document by discussing the following questions with a 
professional:
 When are you planning to fund the trust?
 Have any other family members stated that they want to leave some of
their assets to the special-needs trust?
 Is the trust being funded by a court settlement?
 Do you want to use the trust funds now?
 Do you want to transfer your child’s assets to the trust?
With the wrong type of trust, you risk the loss of government and other bene-
fits. Some trusts are state specific. Do your homework on this before signing
anything.
Of course, if your child is highly functioning and not eligible for means-tested
benefits, you may want to leave her part of your estate. Plan based on your
child’s abilities today, not what you hope for. You can always change your
plan.
Considering ways you can fund the trust
Parents frequently fund special-needs trusts through life insurance. Life
insurance is a common vehicle because it helps people of modest means
“create an estate.” It’s also very important to know the type of life insurance
policy you are purchasing. Make sure it will fund the trust upon your death.
If you and your spouse are retired or close to retirement, and your children
are adults, you may have pensions, a home with high equity, and no financial
responsibility to other children. In this case, you don’t need insurance.
Rental properties, mutual funds, stocks, inheritance, and gifts from others —
any income-producing asset — will suffice.
Putting your special-needs plan in play
Setting up a special-needs trust requires many considerations on your part,
including disinheriting your child, writing a letter of intent, and appointing a
trustee.
Disinheriting your child
Strange as it may sound, disinheriting your autistic son or daughter may be
the kindest step you can take if your assets aren’t enormous (like most of us!)
and your child isn’t completely self-supporting. In these cases, the federal
and state governments are obligated to support your child. You disinherit
your child by not leaving him financial assets in your will, or you leave him a
token amount such as $1 to show that you have not forgotten him. As Jaime
Parent, father of an autistic adult who speaks frequently on financial planning
327
Chapter 16: Special-Needs Planning for the Future

for disabilities, says, “Your child owns nothing.” Parent, who lives in
Maryland, also highly recommends purchasing a life insurance policy for
your own peace of mind. Other advocates suggest that it is unnecessary if
you have other assets to fund the child’s trust.
When you disinherit your child, you must make sure that Grandma, cousin
George in Toronto, and your child’s best friend don’t make him the benefi-
ciary of their wills or of any insurance policies. You need to explain that their
generous and well-intended gifts could end up hurting your child by disquali-
fying him from the benefits he depends on. You better check your own poli-
cies, too, while you’re at it! Let’s say Grandma leaves your child $5,000 during
your lifetime. He can’t just write out a check to you once he’s receiving gov-
ernment benefits, because authorities will ask questions about any question-
able transactions. They may want to reduce his benefits by the amount of the
gift, something you’d probably like to avoid.
In the worst-case scenario, money received by a child with autism can be
transferred out of his or her name without affecting benefits, if you have the
right type of trust. If the amount is small (say under $10,000), reimbursement
or prepayment of rent (if the child is over 18) is one way. If the amount is
over $10,000 from an inheritance or a legal settlement, an OBRA93 Special
Needs Trust may be appropriate (OBRA93 stands for Omnibus Budget and
Reconciliation Act, which was created in 1993). This type of special-needs
trust is funded by the person with autism. It is the most restrictive type of
trust and has a payback provision to the government after the beneficiary
dies. The fact that it allows your child to remain on SSI and Medicaid over-
rides any of its provisions.
When you fill out government forms, you want to be able to say that your
child has no assets at all, not a checking account containing $2,000, for exam-
ple. If he has one, agency officials will monitor the account to make sure it
stays under $2,000. Your best course of action is to clean out the assets
entirely, as tough as that may seem.
Writing a letter of intent
Another part of the special-needs trust process is writing a letter of intent — 
a statement that sets out your wishes for your child’s care for a future care-
giver (who may be a different person from the trustee). It shouldn’t even be
mentioned in any legal document so it isn’t construed to be a part of it, which
enables you to write anything and not worry about legal language. Nobody
other than the care providers can prepare this letter because the advisors
don’t have intimate knowledge of the person. The letter of intent is a docu-
ment that is ever-changing as the person grows and matures. You can make
changes without having to use an attorney, notarize signatures, and have wit-
nesses each time. Your special-needs planner may have a template that you
can follow when drafting the letter. The following should be included in this
letter:
328
Part IV: Living with Autism as an Adult 

 Information on your child’s physical and mental condition — this is the
most important part of your letter
 Medications, physicians, food allergies, and medical history
 Your aspirations for your child’s future
 Your beliefs about issues such as dating and marriage, religion, living sit-
uation, work, and academic plans for your child
 Your child’s interests, hopes and dreams, hobbies, social habits, likes
and dislikes
This information helps the future caregiver manage your child’s daily activi-
ties after you’re gone. But don’t wait to give the letter of intent to people — 
it’s invaluable now to other family members, friends, teachers, school nurse,
therapists, and government support coordinators. It tells them everything
they need to know now about your child. You can sometimes obtain tem-
plates for these letters from special-needs planners.
Appointing a trustee
You also need to appoint a trustee. You charge the trustee whom you name 
in your will with managing the funds in the special-needs trust. That person
may be a relative, a family friend, or possibly a professional trustee. You can
obtain professional referrals from places such as MetLife or Merrill Lynch.
Trust companies include Wells Fargo, Chase Manhattan, Harris Trust, Mass
Mutual Trust Company, Heartland Financial, and Northern Trust.
Before naming an institution as a trustee, you must meet with a representa-
tive and know their fees, services, and minimum amount it will manage. Often
there is a minimum you must meet to qualify.
Families have the option of naming a trusted friend or family member as a co-
trustee with a financial institution. Or you may elect to name family or friends
without an institution. Trustees can hire professionals for investment, tax,
and management advice.
You must carefully design the trust so that the trustee (who has complete
authority over its funds) doesn’t allow the beneficiary (your child) too much
income so that his benefits are jeopardized. This is a great example of why
you need an attorney who understands special-needs planning and is familiar
with your state’s trust laws (see the section “Involving an Attorney and/or
Financial Planner” earlier in this chapter).
The trust must also stipulate the following:
 What happens to the trust funds after the beneficiary dies, along with
funeral arrangements for the beneficiary
 Who becomes the trustee if the original trustee dies
329
Chapter 16: Special-Needs Planning for the Future

 That the funds supplement, not replace, other benefits (Items that don’t
reduce federal payments include medical care, telephone bills, educa-
tion, and entertainment.)
 That the trust not be used to pay family debts
Other decisions that you need to make with respect to the special-needs trust
and your will, with the help of an attorney, are as follows:
 Choosing a revocable or irrevocable trust. This means whether you can
remove funds from the trust while you’re still alive, in the event of an
emergency. A revocable special-needs trust with assets in excess of
$2,000 will result in the loss of or ineligibility for government benefits.
The trust must be irrevocable in order for the assets not to be consid-
ered to belong to the person with autism. Don’t put money in the 
special-needs trust if you think you may need it back! You can’t take it
back or use it for anyone else in an irrevocable trust.
 Choosing a living or testamentary trust. Living means you and others
can fund it now and use it; testamentary means it goes into effect after
the parents’ deaths. The problem with testamentary is that no one (for
example, your child’s grandparents) can name a testamentary trust as
beneficiary if they don’t know when it will be in effect.
 Determining how to take care of the autistic child without excluding her
siblings in your will.
Giving a morally obligated gift
If your child needs a great deal of help and disinheriting him seems too harsh
(see the section “Putting your special-needs plan in play” for more on the
topic of disinheriting), consider this option for your will: You can gift one of
the child’s siblings with what’s called a morally obligated gift. This gift indi-
cates that you give the money to one of the siblings and trust her to share it
with your autistic child in the way that you spell out before your death.
Obviously, you must trust that your child will carry out your wishes if you do
this. A morally obligated gift isn’t legally enforceable, and that’s the rub. Use
this only as a last resort. If you go this route, you can still leave items to your
autistic child that may have personal value to him, as long as they don’t
exceed $2,000 in worth.
Your son or daughter, if mentally competent, can hire whatever assistance he
or she needs to help with managing the gift.
330
Part IV: Living with Autism as an Adult 

Even if your autistic child’s sibling is responsible, however, he may have diffi-
culty carrying out your wishes. He may become ill or disabled, or he may go
bankrupt. He may have to make difficult choices. He may die or divorce,
putting the money into other hands. Because of these risks, if your autistic
child needs lifetime care, morally obligated gifts may put siblings under too
much pressure. It may take a little more work in the beginning, but we recom-
mend a trust as the strongest option, regardless of how trustworthy your
child is.
Designating guardianship
The topic is hard to even think about, but you need to decide who you want
to take care of your child if something happens to you before she’s of legal
age or if she’s incapable of making her own decisions when she turns 18 or
21. (If you’re around when she reaches the age of maturity, and she’s inca-
pable of making her own decisions, you may want to consider having yourself
declared her legal guardian. If she can make her own decisions for the most
part, you have a dilemma.)
When choosing a guardian, make a list of everyone you know, eliminate the
ones you know you don’t want, put the others in the order you want them to
serve, and then ask them in succession. You can use this same method when
choosing successor trustees.
If your child isn’t able to read and understand on an adult level, can’t drive a
motor vehicle, and can’t manage her affairs, you’re helping her by becoming
her guardian. You shouldn’t beat yourself up about it. You aren’t taking her
freedom from her. Some states are even beginning to pass legislation that
allows adults with guardians the right to vote and drive.
We asked Bart Stevens, owner of Bart Stevens Special Needs Planning, LLC —
a provider of fee-based planning services (on the Web at www.bssnp.com or
toll free at 888-447-2525) — and author of The ABC’s of Special Needs Planning
Made Easy (The Stevens Group, LLC, Scottsdale, Arizona), for his suggestions
on guardianship. This is what he said:
 The first step is to evaluate, with the help of professionals, your child’s
abilities. Pay close attention to her when she performs typical activities
such as dressing, bathing, toileting, preparing meals, and so on. Evaluate
your child and make the decision that is in your child’s best interest.
You can always rescind guardianship at a later time or apply for it as
well.
If all parties agree that the child isn’t capable of performing these activi-
ties, full legal guardianship may be appropriate.
331
Chapter 16: Special-Needs Planning for the Future

Many states offer the option of limited guardianship specifically for
healthcare, finances, education, and so on.
 Another option is that the person with autism can execute a living will
and power of attorney for healthcare, finances, and legal matters. This
doesn’t take away any rights. If the person with autism has no assets,
the courts may appoint an attorney at no charge, and court costs may
be waived. The person can change and/or terminate the living will at any
time. The person can also override any decisions made by the person
with power unless otherwise stated.
Friends and/or family can fill any of the guardianship positions. Some states
offer public and private fiduciary services when you can’t find anyone to
serve. You may choose one or more guardians to serve together. Also, if the
person with autism moves to another state of residence, a guardian has to
repetition to maintain guardian status. Successor guardians must also go
through the petition process. States vary in their guardianship procedures.

Ten Tactful Responses to
Challenging Questions 
or Comments
In This Chapter
 Discovering when no answer may be the best response
 Doling out meaningful and humorous comebacks
 Finding out how a person with autism would respond
S
adly, people with autism often face social disapproval — not because
they look different, but because they look so “normal.” Unlike other dis-
abilities, autism doesn’t clearly disable a person on the outside. People with
autism are expected to behave “normally,” which can make life difficult for
them and for their parents. Parents face unwanted, awkward choices: Do you
explain to others that your child is special, or do you hope that they won’t
judge you or invade your privacy if your child does something disruptive?
We’re here to help ease your discomfort, if only momentarily. This chapter
gives you tips for handling some common uncomfortable situations you may
encounter, whether you’re a person with autism or the caregiver of one.
“What Special Talent Does He Have?”
You think you’ve finally found somebody who’s sympathetic and nonjudg-
mental to talk to. You’re happily conversing, and then out of nowhere comes
the dreaded “What special talent does he have” query. People usually deliver
this question in a friendly way, but suddenly your child is reduced to the
status of circus performer and conversation piece.

Whether your child has a “special talent” isn’t really relevant here. The point
is that you don’t want to reduce him to being capable of only that ability.
Would your companion ask you that about your other children? Would he or
she be comfortable with you posing the same query? The implication is
upsetting and annoying.
Was the person’s motive rudeness? No, it was simple ignorance. The person’s
friendliness attests to his or her goodwill. So you may want to give the bene-
fit of the doubt. Here are some gentle ways to educate somebody asking this
question:
 “Some autistic children have special talents and some don’t, just like the
rest of us. What’s your special talent?”
 “I don’t know, but I can tie my tongue into a knot.”
 “We don’t think of him that way. We think everything he does shows
talent, considering how hard he has to work to overcome his disability.”
 “He puts up with dumb questions from strangers.” (Just kidding! Stop!
You should run this through your head to make yourself smile before
moving to one of the previous suggestions.)
“Why Can’t You Control Your Kid?”
Variations on the control-your-kid theme are numerous: “What kind of parent
lets his/her child misbehave that way?” “Didn’t you teach her any manners?”
“Let me have your child for a weekend . . . I’ll straighten her out!” Or just a
plain-old, judgmental Bad-Parent Look.
People with autism often perceive the world very differently from others,
which results in unexpected differences in behavior. Although the lighting in
a department store may simply seem garish to some, it may be totally over-
whelming to a person who sees fluorescent lighting like a strobe light. The
result is a sensory-overload tantrum. Can you blame the person? Most people
would be uncomfortable shopping in a store lit with strobe lights. (For more
on sensory issues, see Chapter 10.)
Also, most people can filter and prioritize incoming sensory data, which allows
you to ignore sounds, lights, and other information that isn’t important in a
given situation. Many people with autism lack this ability. They have an expe-
rience comparable to watching a television set that receives all 500 or more
channels at once with the volume at full blast.
When someone asks, “Why can’t you control your kid,” the implication is that
you’re a failed, weak, negligent parent, which is why your child doesn’t behave.
Please don’t be tempted to believe this if you get this kind of feedback. When
336
Part V: The Part of Tens 

other people misunderstand or misjudge you, it can be painful and frustrating.
However, if you know that you’re doing the best job you can for your child, you
don’t have to let these emotions get to you.
“Asperger Snausperger. He Looks Fine.
He Just Needs a Better Attitude.”
Hearing criticism from others about your parenting is more likely if you have
a child with Asperger Syndrome than with kids who have more severe forms
of autism. Children with Asperger’s appear to be like everybody else, which
means they don’t get cut much slack for unusual behavior.
So what can you do about other parents who criticize your parenting? What
about people who refuse to acknowledge your child’s diagnosis? You can
point out that most people used to think the earth was flat and that evil spir-
its caused epilepsy. It may be better, however, to give them something to read
about autism. Education can be the best revenge.
Some parents and people with autism carry wallet-sized cards or pamphlets
you can purchase from the Autism Society of America (www.autism-
society.org) and other organizations to hand to ignorant strangers. If
people refuse to listen, quietly move on. They’ve made their choice. You can
help educate only those who have open minds.
“Who Did He Inherit It From?”
A person who asks “Who did he inherit it from?” reveals ignorance more than
anything else. This question makes you feel defensive, as if you must explain
something you don’t even fully understand yourself. You wish others would
think about the implications of what they say before opening their mouths.
You can say, “Yes, current research indicates that autism has a strong genetic
factor, which then gets triggered by something else.” But you’re not responsi-
ble for explaining the causes of autism to the world, especially because
research hasn’t established causation anyway (see Chapter 3). You have
enough on your plate. Just say, “I don’t know,” and leave it at that.
You can also go for a humorous response if you like. Both parents can eagerly
claim genetic responsibility. Or if only one spouse is present, you can state —
with a smile — “Although my spouse claims responsibility, I know that the
genes come from MY side.”

Chapter 17: Ten Tactful Responses to Challenging Questions or Comments

“Why Should Your Child 
Get Special Treatment?”
People usually don’t wonder outright why your child gets special treatment,
but that can be implied when parents try to arrange special services for their
children, such as accommodations in school or behavioral, educational, or
developmental programs (see Chapters 9 and 10). The best defense is to know
your rights. Under the law, your child has the right to an education, and if his
education costs more than others, that’s irrelevant. (See Chapter 12 to find out
more about your rights.) What’s relevant is that he gets the help he needs.
Similarly, children with disabilities don’t fall under the same laws regarding
school disciplinary procedures, nor should they. If they don’t understand in
the first place that a behavior is against the rules, autistic kids can’t be held to
the same standard. Their behavior is different from willful misbehavior. The
school isn’t giving special treatment, it’s using common sense. We present a
good Functional Behavioral Assessment in Chapter 11 that will usually reveal
the sensory, pragmatic, or other underpinnings of challenging behaviors.
As with many other questions, education may be the best response. Do your
best to educate others about the obstacles presented by autism as well as
the contributions to society by people with differences, such as Albert
Einstein and Thomas Edison.
You don’t have to justify your child’s treatment. A child with autism should
get what he needs because he needs it. Simple as that. The Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and common
decency say so.
“Are You Kidnapping That Child?”
When an autistic child acts up in public, it may look like her parents are abus-
ing or even kidnapping her. Security may even approach the parents on the
child’s behalf.
Keep your cool and consider your objective when responding to accusations
from strangers. If you get upset, you solidify someone’s negative judgment of
you. A soft answer may disarm the most narrow-minded busybody. A person
who’s really concerned will probably back off.
338
Part V: The Part of Tens 

This situation happened to Dennis Debbaudt, a private investigator, when 
his autistic child was in the midst of a full-blown tantrum as he carried him
through a mall parking lot. Dennis has devoted his life to helping policemen,
firefighters, and other first responders with his book, Autism, Advocates, and
Law Enforcement Professionals: Recognizing and Reducing Risk Situations for
People with Autism Spectrum Disorders (Jessica Kingsley Publishers).
The “Bad-Parent” Look
The bad-parent look can be among the hardest things to deal with because
it’s just a look (or sometimes just body language), but it implies that you’re
lower than a politician with a racketeering indictment and deserving of zero
respect. And your options for response are limited because the judgment is
indirect. How can you respond when nothing is actually said? Maybe you
don’t want to respond, but you feel like you should set the record straight.
Ask yourself what you hope to accomplish. Are you responding for yourself
or for your child? Are you too worried about what others will think if you say
something or if you don’t say anything? Are you missing a chance to educate
others about autism if you don’t? We can’t give you a right or wrong answer.
The trouble with responding calmly in these situations is that you have the
added drama of dealing with your child while trying to appear under control.
This makes a neutral, nondefensive tone difficult to convey.
One way to deal with the situation is to ask, “Pardon me?” or “May I help
you?” as sweetly as humanly possible. A judgmental person will be so embar-
rassed that he or she will just mutter something incomprehensible and scoot
away.
“Is She Still in Her Own World?”
The question “Is she still in her own world?” is an all-time candidate for insen-
sitivity. In fact, due to sensory hypersensitivities, many people with autism
are so much more aware of the world around them that it’s painful. Imagine
being able to hear the ticking of every electric clock in the house or being
driven to distraction from the crinkling of a plastic bag that someone is stuff-
ing under the kitchen sink.
339
Chapter 17: Ten Tactful Responses to Challenging Questions or Comments

Our friend Kassiane Sibley, a person on the autism spectrum, recommends a
couple routes to take in response, each with a bit different tone. Here’s the
first, more . . . ahem . . . bold response: (Staring blankly) “Who else’s world
would she be in? I mean, really. It’s not like they beam us all off the planet at
age 22. Do they? If they did I missed my flight. Darn.”
She takes a more educational approach with this response: “Or, alternatively,
you can explain how autistic people tune out because they are overwhelmed
by a world that is too loud, too bright, talks too fast with weird figures of
speech . . . and so as a protective mechanism, people on the spectrum often
tune out. Autistic people like precise language. Asking if an autistic person is
in his or her own world has a pretty good chance of getting hackles up. That’s
why he or she is glaring at you silently instead of answering although he or
she may be perfectly verbal.”
You have multiple ways to answer the same question, so have fun!
“They Grow Out of It, Don’t They?”
A person who says, “They grow out of it, don’t they?” says it out of inno-
cence, or out of ignorance, perhaps. Although it isn’t your personal duty to
educate everyone you meet about autism, you can combat flagrant miscon-
ceptions. In this situation, we recommend a neutral reply to the effect that
autism remains a lifelong challenge for those who have it.
“But She Doesn’t Look Autistic . . .”
People diagnosed with autism, Asperger Syndrome, or Pervasive
Developmental Disorder — Not Otherwise Specified (see Chapter 2) don’t look
any different than anyone else. They may exhibit differences in behavior or
movement, but aside from the possibility of children with Asperger Syndrome
having slightly larger heads, outsiders can see no defining features.
The lack of physical differences results in confusion to people not in the
know. They expect more from your child than he or she may be able to give.
Autism is a difference in how the brain is wired, not of the body. Possible
responses can range from brief education about the brain being wired differ-
ently to talking about other conditions such as heart disease and diabetes
not resulting in any physical differences.

Ten Things to Do after a Diagnosis
In This Chapter
 Educating yourself and others
 Taking essential steps in the treatment process
 Coming to terms with the diagnosis
 Allowing life to move on
W
hen you first receive the diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder
(ASD) for your child, whether you suspect it or not, the news can be a
major shock. In this chapter, we offer ten tips for getting started after diagno-
sis, captured at one of our favorite Web sites, www.autisminfo.com.
(Thanks to Brad Middlebrook, an occupational therapist, for his permission
to adapt the tips for our readers.) Although each step may logically progress
from one to the next, you may want to do more than one simultaneously.
Learn and Read as Much as Possible
When you begin researching, the glut of available information and advice can
be overwhelming. You may find that the information seems very complicated,
but press on. The more you read and discover, the easier it will be to under-
stand new information. Even the complicated medical information will begin
to make sense. Think of the task of researching as putting together a huge
puzzle. But always remember to consider the source of any information you
find. Also, try to keep an open mind by not focusing on one intervention or
therapy exclusively. No treatment works for everyone. Search until you find
the right combination for your child.
For not much money, you can stay informed by checking out and subscribing
to newsletters offered by major autism organizations such as the Autism
Society of America (ASA), Unlocking Autism (UA), the Autism Research
Institute (ARI), and Cure Autism Now! (CAN!). We list the organizations and
publications in the Appendix along with other helpful resources you can use
to expand your research. You can also ask your local library to buy more
books on autism.

If it seems like you’re getting more familiar with your computer than your
family, you may be spending too much time online. You need to strike a bal-
ance between researching and networking and spending time with your family.
Network with Other Families
Many parents of children with autism preach that other families in similar sit-
uations provide the most important support system of all. If you’re active in
the autism community, which we recommend (see Chapter 14), you’ll meet
numerous parents at support groups and conferences who are going through
the same struggles and are happy to share their experiences. This cama-
raderie can greatly reduce the sense of isolation you may be feeling. You can
find leads to support groups through the Appendix in this book, as well as
through parents of other children diagnosed with autism and therapists and
other professionals.
If you can’t make it to conferences or support-group meetings, you can pur-
chase audiotapes or watch Web casts of many conferences. But do make
every effort to attend these sessions. The people you meet can be even more
helpful than the presentations you attend.
Test, Test, Test
Test your child early to get a baseline picture of where he or she is. A clear
picture of your child’s biological condition provides a roadmap for treat-
ments and therapies to follow. If you can’t afford all the tests you need up
front, prioritize them — with your medical providers’ help. (See Part II for
more testing and medical information.)
Investigate Sources of Financial Aid
You must continually pursue avenues of financial aid. Autism can quickly
exhaust your resources, but, fortunately, funding and assistance do exist.
Financial aid is generally available at the county level for children under the
age of 3. You need to apply for the Medicaid waiver, known in some states as
the Katy Beckett deeming waiver. If you don’t ask, you won’t receive. (See
Chapter 16 for more.)
Keep good financial records. Any organization that gives you funding may
want a reasonable accounting from time to time. And avoid using the words
“autism” or “PDD-NOS” with insurance companies. If you’re treating biological
abnormalities such as a yeast overgrowth, abnormal immune markers, or 
diarrhea, have the doctor code the treatment as such. Many HMOs specifically
342
Part V: The Part of Tens 

exclude autism in their policies, but your child deserves treatment for his
health problems, just as any neurotypical child would get.
Consider Major Lifestyle Changes
Treating autism can seriously drain your financial resources. Depending on
your situation, you may have to enact major change (such as changing your
job or downsizing your home). Of course, you should consider all your
options before doing something drastic; you may need to make only short-
term sacrifices to allow for the funds that you’ll need to treat your child. The
good news is that the costs you have are often not permanent; they’re
upfront costs that may not last for more than a few years.
If you have a spouse or significant other, you need to support each other and
establish a division of responsibilities. You need to understand the time com-
mitment associated with caring for an individual with an autism spectrum
disorder. Take time to think about how this added responsibility will impact
your life and possibly your relationships with others. You may need to take
steps to reorganize where you devote your time in order to make increased
allowances for treating someone with autism.
Autism treatment takes sacrifice, but the hard work pays off. Many parents
will tell you that the emotional rewards you experience — regardless of your
child’s progress — are much more lasting than any hobby or house can bring.
Set Up an Educational/Behavioral
Program in Your Home
If you can afford it, a structured one-on-one program that focuses on education
and behavior works for many children with autism (see Chapter 9). Just make
sure the program is reputable, and be certain everyone involved with the pro-
gram shares your expectations and goals. Have your tutors and consultants
read and sign a contract you put together that specifically states what they’ll
do and what you’ll do. A contract puts everyone on the same page, literally.
Begin Therapies
The medical professional who diagnoses your child may refer him to other
specialists for therapy, including speech, occupational, and physical therapy.
These therapies help your child gain communication, social, and physical
skills (see Chapters 9 and 10). Insurance providers, including Medicaid, often
cover the cost.
343
Chapter 18: Ten Things to Do after a Diagnosis

Address Your Child’s Diet and Nutrition
Dietary sensitivities affect many people with autism. Consider trying diets
(such as the wheat-free and dairy-free diets explained in Chapter 8) that have
helped many children respond with better behavior within about 3 to 4
weeks.
Based on medical testing and your doctor’s recommendations, you also
should start your child on vitamin and mineral supplementation geared for
his needs. It’s likely your child isn’t meeting his body’s nutritional needs
(many autistic people have nutritional deficiencies). Be sure to consult with a
nutritionist and pediatrician who have expertise in autism. Find good ones
you feel comfortable with and trust, even if they don’t live in your area. (For
more on supplementation, see Chapters 7 and 8.)
As you clean up and possibly restrict the diet of your child, try doing the
same for yourself. Autism drains you physically, especially if you’re not in
good health. Find time to exercise and eat right to improve your health —
both you and your child will benefit.
Don’t Give Up
Attitude is everything! From the start, try to be a morale booster for your
doctors, therapists, teachers, and family. Remember, autism shouldn’t pre-
clude you from laughing and having fun together as a family. Educate your
doctors who aren’t familiar with autistic patients, and encourage them to
read about autism. Provide up-to-date information to those who can help you.
Many of the treatments and interventions take time to produce results. Be
patient. Work hard every day after the diagnosis, and demand that others
work hard as well. It will pay off.
Get Out and Relax
After you find out everything you need to do for your child, you may be
tempted to give up everything you do for yourself and put the focus solely on
your child. But making time for yourself and relaxing are necessary. You must
take care of yourself to be of any good to your child. Encourage your spouse
to take time to recharge as well.

In This Chapter
 Putting other books on autism spectrum disorders in your library
 Searching Web sites that deal with autism spectrum disorders
 Absorbing information from people on the autism spectrum
 Making contact with chat rooms and listserves
 Focusing on advocacy and autism information around the world
M
aybe your goal for this book is to gather as much info as you can to pro-
vide your autistic child with the best treatment possible. Maybe you
want to pick out the best doctors, diets, and treatment plans medicine has to
offer. Maybe you, an autistic adult, want information on making the transition
to interdependence. For these goals and many more, our book is all you need!
However, autism research advances almost daily, and doctors discover more
and more as time passes about this condition and how to help people with
autism recover function to lead fulfilling and productive lives. Therefore, you
should have additional resources at your disposal to keep up with the times.
In this Appendix, we provide a classified list of additional resources that will
help you discover more about the autism spectrum as you continue to sup-
port and nurture the people with autism you know and love. Consider this
compilation the beginning of a journey, where we lead you to many other
useful resources that we can’t include here due to limited space.
Even if you don’t agree with some of the philosophies promoted by some of
these organizations, keep in mind that it can be useful to know what people
and organizations are doing and thinking about in the diverse world of
autism. As with other challenges you face in life, you should consider multi-
ple sources according to your needs.

Understanding Autism For Dummies 
Temple Grandin’s recommended reading
Dr. Temple Grandin, a university professor who
has autism, has plenty of expertise and personal
experience with autism, which gives her a unique
perspective on the information available. With
this in mind, we asked her to come up with a list
of books that she personally recommends —
books that provide parents and teachers with
more detailed practical information beyond what
may be included in Understanding Autism For
Dummies. Dr. Grandin struggled to narrow down
the list, but here are her top choices. (You can
read more about Dr. Temple Grandin in her clas-
sic Thinking in Pictures, 2nd Edition [Vintage
Press].)

ation of the strengths autistic people have to contribute to society.
 Autistic Adults Picture Project (www.isn.net/~jypsy/AuSpin/
a2p2.htm): A site made up of hundreds of pictures and mini-biographies
of adults with autism. The goal of the site is to develop awareness that
autistic children grow up to be adults on the autism spectrum.
 Autistic Advocacy (home.att.net/~ascaris1): A fascinating collec-
tion of essays and information by Frank Klein, an autism advocate, exam-
ining the issues of self and collective advocacy of people with autism.
 Autistics.org (www.autistics.org): Self-tagged as the “real voice of
autism,” this site is primarily for and by autistic people, although other
members of the autism community may find useful information here. 
 Donna Williams’ Personal Page (www.donnawilliams.net): Author
of several books on autism and known the world over for her consulta-
tions and presentations, Donna Williams welcomes you to discover more
about her — and yourself.
 Institute for the Study of the Neurologically Typical (isnt.autistics
.org): This site puts the “shoe on the other proverbial foot,” using typi-
cal “medicalese” to describe nonspectrum behavior and characteristics.
 University Students with Autism and Asperger Syndrome (www.users
.dircon.co.uk./~cns/index.html): A collection of first-person
accounts by people with autism, centered on college experiences.
Chatting about autism
A chat room is an online interactive typing session with others — somewhat
like instant messaging (IM) with a group of people in one IM window. Chat
rooms can be excellent sources of information and support. But before join-
ing a chat room of any sort, you need to be aware of appropriate Internet 
etiquette:
 Observation is recommended. Take some time to observe the conversa-
tion in a room for content and to find out how people communicate with
each other — especially when entering an unfamiliar chat room.

Understanding Autism For Dummies 

 Discussion is expected. If you disagree with someone or with a topic at
hand, you can state your viewpoint. However, it’s often better to agree 
to disagree.
 Safety first. Don’t reveal personal information about yourself, unless you
know all the members of the chat room well. Also:
• Be careful about getting together with people you have met only 
in a chat room. If you agree to meet with someone, do so where
others are around, such as at an autism conference or other public
location.
• Make the initial meeting short, such as for a cup of coffee.
• Strongly consider bringing a friend with you to meet your Internet
friend for the first time or two.
Here are a couple of Internet-based chat rooms you may find helpful:
 #asperger (www.inlv.demon.nl/irc.asperger): Open only to people
on the autism spectrum, this site is mostly frequented by young adults. To
gain access, you need to use a browser that contains Javascript (which
most current browsers are equipped with) or download International
Relay Chat (IRC) software at www.katkorner.com/ircasperger.html.
 If you belong to the Internet service America Online (AOL), you can find
a number of chat rooms relating to autism (simply look under the People
menu). 
Exploring listserves
Similar to an e-mail list, listserves broadcast member posts to all members
and are a great way to share information and support. To join a listserve,
send an e-mail to the addresses in the list that follows, or visit the Web sites
we include for further information about the communities and how to join.
Like with joining a chat room, you need to be aware of appropriate Internet
etiquette for listserves. See the previous section for Internet etiquette advice.
 AUTINET (AutAdvo-subscribe@yahoogroups.com): The primary
goal of this listserve is to promote understanding and unity between
people on the autism spectrum and parents, doctors, teachers, and
others in the greater autism community. You can find more information
at the site health.groups.yahoo.com/group/AutAdvo.
 AUTISM (listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu): The oldest and most
well-established listserve on autism-related information.
353
Appendix: Where to Go for More Help

 Autism Network International (listserve@listserve.syr.edu):
Primarily for people with autism; however, parents and others can take
part as well. You can find more information about the listserve at Autism
Network International’s Web site (ani.autistics.org).
Accessing World-Wide Autism
Organizations and Resources
If you live outside the United States or are just curious to see what resources
are available in other countries, you may find the links in this section useful.
The National Autistic Society in England provides the links. Here are a couple
of overarching international sites to get you started:
 The International Association Autism Europe (www.autismeurope
.org): Focused on raising awareness and political involvement in
Europe, this group’s main objective is to bring forward the rights of
autistic people and their families.
 World Autism Organisation (www.worldautism.org): Dedicated to
improving the quality of life for people with autism and those supporting
them. It holds a biannual World Autism Congress, bringing together autis-
tic people, researchers, and the rest of the global autism community.
For a regularly updated and comprehensive listing of countries and their
associated autism resources, visit the National Autistic Society’s Round-the-
World Web site at www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=661.
