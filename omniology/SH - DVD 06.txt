The Sway Test

Brian:
Spencer:
The sway test. We left that off, so we’re going to do the sway test right now, 
right here in Las Vegas, Nevada. I need somebody I don’t know and that 
I’ve never hypnotized. Come on up here, your arm was up there quick.
Applause
Brian, do I know you?
Nope.
This is the sway test. There again, I’m going to show you how this works, 
and then you can do this and you can turn this as a test into an induction. 
There are two different ways that you can do this. I want you to be very 
careful of the person you’re working with because, if they fall over on top of 
you, you can both go down to the ground and you don’t want that to 
happen.
Let me move the chairs out of the way. It’s kind of like if you do a rapid 
induction and you say, sleep. If you’re a little guy or a big guy, you’ve 
always got this leg planted behind you, right? Leverage. It’s the same thing 
with the sway test.
For example, if I take him this way – and you can go frontwards or 
backwards, but I’ll go like this. Just close your eyes down. Now, I’ve seen 
this done a number of ways. There is not a right way to do it; there’s not a 
wrong way, some people are just a little goofier than others. Be whatever 
you want to be. A lot of this stuff I just find kind of goofy to begin with and I 
don’t even know why I do this. 
Some of the things that people do, they’ll kind of – put your feet together, 
please. I want you feet together because you have more of an off-balance, 
right? It’s easier to get somebody off balance that way. You want to make 
sure that you hold onto them because they could fall over, so you want to 
be careful. 
Eyes closed. All right, here’s what I’m going to do. In a moment I’m 
going to take my hands off your back. When I do, you’re going to 
feel…

Watch what I’m doing. I’m not doing anything, but because I’m holding him 
like this and he’s already kind of off balance when I release my hands, 
automatically he’s going to start coming backwards. So the psychology here 
is this, you’re a magic person. 
In just a moment, I will take my hands off your back and you will feel 
a force coming from behind your back. It’s like a magnet, drawing 
you backwards. Drawing you and pulling you backwards. You cannot 
stop it. Just feel it and come backwards. Let yourself go. I will catch 
you. You will not fall over. 
Leg planted. You’re ready for this, right? Let’s see what happens. I’ve had 
big guys fall on me it’s not a pleasant experience. Okay, get ready. Feel 
this.
Get ready now. When I release my hands, I want you to feel yourself 
falling backwards. When you do, just let yourself go, all the way 
back; going back, back, back, back. Okay, now.
Did you hear that thud? Oh, I felt it. Whoa. Did we get that? Okay, good. 
That’s a simple sway test backwards. Now how do you turn that into an 
induction? Simple, same way. 
When I take my hands off of your back, you will feel yourself going 
backwards. When you do, let yourself go. I will catch you. Get ready 
now. You’re beginning to come backwards now. The magnet is 
drawing you backwards. You’re coming all the way back, coming 
back, coming back all the way back. And sleep! Go all the way down. 
Loosely, limp and relaxed. 
Did you see how that works? At the same time, you’re bracing yourself. 
Wide awake. 
Applause
Thank you. You could also do it going forwards. So if I have you this way. In 
a moment, you can all practice this it’s so much fun. You little gals, be 
careful. I’ll have you little gals work with little gals. Seriously, if you’ve got a 
big guy coming down on you, it can hurt. 
Laughter
It doesn’t have to hurt though. Anyway, see that’s the power of innuendos. 
It’s not what you say, it’s what they interpret. Kind of like no, don’t even go 
there. Everything you use as part of your show just let it slide.

Close your eyes, down all the way. In a moment, I’m going to take 
my arms off of your shoulders. When I do, you’re going to feel 
yourself coming forward. I’m going to kind of give a little tug and 
you’re coming forward all the way, all the way, all the way. There.
Open your eyes for a second. I want to explain this. You will have some 
people, when you’re doing the sway test, for example… kind of catch 
yourself because you’re like, what the heck’s happening. 
Okay, close your eyes. You’re coming forward, coming forward, 
coming forward. Listen to me. Don’t fall. Be resistant. Trip around a 
little bit, okay? You’re coming forward because I am great at what I 
do. 
Okay, wait a minute. If you get somebody like this, here’s what’s happening. 
They’re not ready. They’re just not ready. It’s not a big deal, but for you, the 
trained competent, confident, professional stage hypnotist, this is not a 
problem. You move right through it. It’s no big deal. It’s just a situation to be 
handled. That’s all it is. Nothing fazes you, because you are professionals. 
You are the cream of the crop. Nothing, nobody is better than you. 
Feet together. 
You like that? That was pretty darn good, I have to say so. Okay, so if 
they’re resisting, it’s no big deal. 
Listen very carefully. Just let yourself fall forward. I’m going to catch 
you. Everything’s going to be fine. Just let yourself go. No big deal. 
Everything’s going to be just fine. Close your eyes, and just feel 
yourself now coming forward, coming forward, all the way forward. 
And sleep!
You can do the same thing, you see? That’s what the sway test is. There’s 
nothing more to it then that. Now, let’s say that you have, for example,
come on up here. You’ll see this happen a lot of times in shows. Why 
people do it, I don’t know but they seem to have fun doing it. 
This is how sometimes you’ll pick out some good subjects. You’ll say who 
wants to be hypnotized come on up. I’m going to break you guys up 
because I want you guys to do the sway test so that we can move forward. 
So what I was saying is that sometimes you’ll see a presentation, and you 
may even want to incorporate this into your show. I don’t know. I present 
these to you so you have options, and that’s all. 
It’s also something you can use on the street, doing a street demonstration, 
it’s fun, powerful and very effective. No big deal. So that’s what I wanted 
you guys to do. Thank you very much. Give them a round of applause and 
make them feel good.

Are you guys feeling comfortable that you are ready to give this a good go? 
When doing the sway test, is there anything that – let’s say – what are the 
limits you should place on the size differential between you and the people 
you’re working with. Like let’s say you get some guy that’s 350 pounds, he’s 
6’ 8” and you’re 5’ 6”.
That would be a little ridiculous to begin with. At some point, we have to 
think this doesn’t make sense and then just follow your instincts and go, this 
doesn’t make sense.
But, I mean in your performance, have you ever come across that situation 
where you felt I couldn’t do it on this guy? Have you seen that happen?
I’m a little cagey though. There are times when I probably shouldn’t do a lot 
of things that I do, how’s that? Does that make sense? I mean if someone’s 
really big, I probably am not going to risk that, but I don’t do the sway test in 
my shows. I show it to you for options. 
If somebody’s really big and I think that I might get hurt, I’m going to just 
say sit down and do something with him seated because I don’t want to get 
hurt. I don’t want them to get hurt and I don’t want something that I do to 
look bad and the audience is going, what are you, a fool?
We’ll take these two questions and then we’ll move through.
Yeah, the sway test was pretty good, but I have seen you do things – I don’t 
know what this is. I’ve seen people walk past you and you snap your fingers 
and they hit the floor and you didn’t catch them they just fell. So, I mean 
you’re talking about having to catch people and I’ve seen you drop them 
like a sack of potatoes. 
I’ve also seen you, which they recommend we don’t, is put a person across 
two chairs.
The human bridge? Yeah, I’ll get into that and talk about that later.
I don’t know whether that’s going to be something that we’d want to do as 
hypnotists or is that something only you can do or what?
I will talk about that tomorrow. I’ll talk about the human bridge – the ins and 
outs and the do’s and don’ts.

As far as somebody just dropping down like a sack of potatoes, I told you 
I’m a little cagey. I go the extra distance, but I do it because I know the 
person is not going to get hurt. That comes with experience. Listen, it’s like 
this. If you’re in a car accident and you’re all tensed up, you’re going to get 
hurt more than somebody who’s totally relaxed. 
So if a person’s walking by me and I say sleep and they’re going down on 
the floor, number one, I’m right there next to them watching where they’re 
going to fall and I’ve already predetermined, prejudged and I’ve already run 
the whole scenario in my mind exactly how they’re going to fall. That’s how 
my mind goes ahead of this thing, it’s like playing chess. 
I look at the stage show, with me it’s like playing a game of chess. I’m 
always 10 moves ahead of everybody else. I know where they’re going to 
land. So if I think they’re going to land inappropriately, I’m going to be there 
to catch them or I’ll have an assistant there. I’ll say, get ready. Boom! And 
take them down. Does that help? 
Women with high heels, do you have to make them take their shoes off, I 
mean for the sway test, do the shoes impede that?
You know what probably not, but could you? That’s a personal call on your 
own. Really it is. Listen, I can’t even count how many shows I’ve done, and 
I’ve never had a problem with a woman wearing high heels. But there 
again, I’m saying I don’t do the sway test. Would I take her shoes off, 
maybe I would just because of the spikey little things that she may have on. 
It could break her ankle and I wouldn’t want to take that risk. 
It goes back to always watch the person. Take care of your participants. 
Their welfare is number one.
How come you don’t do the sway test?
I don’t know. I have things that I do for my own that I really enjoy doing. 
There are other’s that really enjoy doing the sway test. I think what you’ll 
discover as you continue to learn more about stage hypnosis and begin to 
practice it, is you’ll find routines that you like to do for yourself, which are 
the ones that you’ll want to do, the ones that you’re comfortable with. That’s 
all.
I’ve tried all of it to see if I liked it. It didn’t really fit with my personality, the 
way that I want to present a show, but other people do it, they do it very well 
and I think it looks pretty cool. It’s just not my deal.
With that said, everybody stand up. Move all those chairs to the side again 
and let’s get these lines going. That way, I can see what you’re doing and 
see if there’s something going down that I need to take care of, let me be 
able to do that.

Okay folks, who’s feeling a little lethargic after that long day and the meal 
and everything else? Here’s what I’m going to do. Number one, remember,
this is the last hour or so of training tonight. This is the time where you 
really make it or break it as a hypnotist. This is the time to really push for it.
It’s only an hour and you’ll have a lot of time. Two people here with groups 
behind. Two over here with groups behind and two over here, so we have 
six rows in total just like before. 
Row A turn your backs to Row B.
Everyone face this way. There you go.
Row B, you get to do the sway test with the person now. 
Off you go…
You all had an opportunity to do that, correct?
Yes.
Do you all feel good about that?
Yes.
You have a new little tool, a little toy that you can play with tonight, right? 
With that said get your chairs and put them back.
Actually, no chairs because we’re about to do street hypnosis. 
Oh man, stay right where you are. Now it’s going to get ugly.

The Power of Street Hypnosis

Spencer:
Who here as heard the term – I know its crazy – street hypnosis? I know its 
nuts, isn’t it? Who here would like to do some street hypnosis, maybe 
tonight even? Walk up to a random stranger, put them in trance and do 
some cool things with them. Feel fantastic, walk off and they’re thinking, 
who the hell was that person? Wouldn’t that be something?
Can I tell a story?
Please. Do you want to come up here so the camera can actually see you 
as well? 
First off, I’d like to apologize for showing up late to class. Sorry. Secondly, 
we were at dinner tonight and Steve – where are you? Steve, I’m going to 
brag on you, only because you’re a hypno hog. You stole my thunder man, 
but that’s okay. 
The person that showed us to a table broke his tooth, so his tooth was 
broken just maybe 45 minutes ago. We were talking to him and he goes, 
I’m in pain. I’m terrible. He goes, I apologize what do you guys do? I said 
well, we’re hypnotherapists. We here learning to do street hypnosis and 
actually do stage performance. He goes, you guys are hypnotists? Boom! 
Yeah, he wanted it.
So we were sitting down and he’s like, I’ve got this toothache. Then Steve 
comes over, grabs his hand and goes, I’m going to make the pain go away 
for you. He uses the scale pain. Has anyone ever seen this done, where 
they take it and they scale the pain up and down. 
He took the guy’s pain – not completely away – but took it to the level 
where he could actually tolerate it. He was talking differently. He was 
actually feeling good. He came back. Four waitresses were coming up to us 
and then they thought we were what? Psychics. Then they thought we were 
psychics. No, we’re hypnotists.
So there are about six or seven people coming from the hotel staff up here 
that are coming down here to the Sunday show. They’re bringing their 
guests and everything else like that so, kudos to you, Steve.
Applause
Very good.

Two-Minute Street Hypnosis
Igor:
Students:
Igor:
Now folks, just so you realize there is nothing that these guys are doing that 
you can’t do already. This is after one day of training. I’d like to prove that to 
you would that be fair? Yes? 
I want you to just mill around like this is a public gathering. I’d like you to 
just find for the moment, just one person and just go up to them like you did 
this morning and say very congruently, hi, I’m a hypnotist. 
Then I want you to say something nice – like, you look like you’re having 
fun here – just as a way of a little chit-chat. Can I show you something 
cool? Yeah? Put your hands out like this. Where am I going?
Suggestion test.
You know these things already. These are easy, aren’t they? Can you walk 
up to a person, a pretend stranger in this room and say hi, I’m a hypnotist? 
Is that hard? Can you say something like a vaguely pleasant, sort of chatty 
thing, which is maybe a throwaway line to allow you to say something, like 
let me show you something cool. Is that easy to do?
In fact, if you want to go hardcore, you don’t even do the chit-chat. You go 
hi, I’m a hypnotist, can I show you something cool? Put your hands out like 
this. It’s crazy, I know, isn’t it? It gets better.
I want you to do is go around the room, introduce yourself as a hypnotist 
and ask if you might show them something. You can phrase it anyway you 
want – can I show you something cool? Here’s a cool trick on the power of 
the mind. Would you like to use your mind in a better way? Whatever way 
you going to phrase it, I really don’t care. Experiment, other people will 
experiment with you and you’ll find phrasing that works for you.
All you do is:
1. Suggestion test.
2. Take that straight into a conversion to an instant induction.
3. Once they’re there, fractionate it once or twice. 
4. Do a little stiff arm thing on top of that.
So you’ve done a whole little mini-skit and you’re done. This should be a no 
brainer for you guys by this stage. It’s just everything you’ve been doing 
today put together into one little two-minute package. This does not take 
more than two minutes. If you’re here 15 minutes later going and now the 
arm is getting stiff and… that’s really the wrong kind of hypnosis.

I’m not saying there’s anything wrong with that style of hypnosis. It has its 
place, but it’s not on the street. Does that make sense?
Yes.
You should be able to do the whole routine, fractionation, a quick demo – I 
call them street demos just because it’s not a test and that way people can’t 
fail them. Do the street demo, fractionation and one extra little thing to wow 
them away. It’s very easy to do. Two minutes, bam-bam you’re through. 
Come back and then if you’re good, we’ll show you something really cool. 
Would you like that?
Yes.
Off you go. Let’s see some energy.

Are you all enjoying this?
Yes.
What we’re going to do now is we’re going to start building this into a full 
blown street hypnosis routine. Why? Because why not? How many of you 
are planning to go out tonight and maybe trying this stuff out? Get together 
and you know what, even if you don’t want to do it, just hang out with these 
guys and watch them just because its fun and you never know, you may get 
inspired and have a go as well. 
I strongly recommend you go out and just put that extra mile in, even if it’s 
just an extra hour or so just to do it. Isn’t it inspiring, isn’t it fun for those of 
you who have done it already? This will show you that the difference 
between here and out there is small to none. In fact, usually out there you 
get better responses because people are just blown away by it, they don’t 
even know what’s going on.
What I’d like to do now is prepare you for that moment a little bit more in 
terms of what you’re looking for and in terms of looking at the dynamic. I 
know you’ve done a lot of stuff with Spencer about the dynamic of stage 
and of what’s going on inside people’s minds and so on. We want to apply 
that to a street hypnosis session would that be useful?
Yes.
The very first thing you do is, we’re going to just look at the mechanics of a 
session, and then we’re going to look at the dynamics separately. 
The first thing you’re looking for – and one and two really are the same 
thing – is you’ve got to test their attitude. If you go up to a group of people 
and go hi guys and they go, what do you want? Is that a good group to be 
doing streets demos with? You go, actually nothing.
Laughter
Why work so hard? I remember when I first started doing it years ago it was 
really a lot of awful stuff, nothing like you are capable of right now. I was 
terrified and I thought I had to make it work with everyone. Now it’s like, you 
know what I don’t want it do it with you, don’t worry about it I’ll go with these 
guys here. 

© Street Hypnosis Publishing All Rights Reserved
11
                                 
So find people that you might think are fun. If they look like they’re having 
fun, just go up and say hey guys, you look like you’re having fun I’m a 
hypnotist. Can I show you something cool? What we’ve just done here is 
very important. It’s a little throwaway line. 
We start to feed their attitude by giving them a reason to take part. You look 
like you’re fun. You look like you’re smart. What is the implication here, that 
what we’re about to do is going to be fun or what we’re going to be doing 
here is for smart people? Is that going to create a cooperation frame 
between you and them or a competition, like I’ll show you Mr. Hypnotist 
Man that you don’t have power over me? Which is it?
Cooperation.
So the one thing you do not want to do is create this thing like hey, I’m 
Hypno-Man, yeah! Try and resist me now and I will hypnotize you to do 
stupid things and you can’t stop me! You can try that out tonight if you want. 
Laughter
You won’t get a refund if you do all right. The attitude that they present to 
you when you start the whole interaction off, that is the key. It tells you 
whether, or not you even want to continue in the first place. 
Part of the attitude then comes with compliance. Will they do what you ask? 
Can you stand over here a second, just stand over there. You want to play 
with the whole group. Let me re-emphasize this. One of the biggest 
mistakes you can make is switch to one person ignoring the rest of the 
group, because the group dynamic is not in your favor. You want the group 
with you, even if you’re not working with the whole group. Does that make 
sense?
You want everyone being fascinated. Just say, just move around here. 
Don’t worry, if you’re scared that’s fine, just watch you’ll enjoy this. You, 
you’re going to be good. So you’re involving people so that they don’t start 
messing with the dynamic of what’s going on there. Does that make sense?
How do we do it? We test for compliance. Even people who aren’t 
necessarily volunteering for your demos, you’ll still get them to comply by 
saying you just stand over here and over there. Give them a little bit of 
space, they’ll be fine. If they’re not compliant, what do you do? You say you 
know what guys, its okay we’ll go somewhere else and do something 
different. At least you can talk about it or something like that, but you don’t 
want to start any kind of demo if the dynamic is not in your favor. Does that 
make sense to everyone?

This is one of the biggest mistakes I see people do. Usually this happens at 
parties. Someone says go on then, hypnotize me, and people go, all right. 
You’re already going to lose at that point, aren’t you? It doesn’t mean you 
can’t do it, but if you know about these two things, then you’re going to look 
for the attitude to be in place before you actually begin anything that is more 
hypnotic. 
You could actually say okay, I just want to see if you can actually 
concentrate properly first. So you put a challenge on saying can you keep 
up rather than, can you fight me? Then you do the whole compliance thing, 
like move them around, move them up a little bit. You can do a classic 
suggestion demo at that point – a street demo, but now it’s a test of 
concentration, rather than a test of can I make the Hypnotist Man fail. Do 
you see how we doing this so far? 
Next, we’re looking for attention and focus. We’re looking for the people 
who are most attentive and most focused on whom?
You.
No, me. Exactly! You are the hypnotist. That means you are the center of 
attention for that demo. It doesn’t mean that you have to be the world’s 
biggest egotist. You can be if you want to, but you don’t have to be, but 
whilst you’re doing the demo, all the energy, all the attention is flowing 
through you. You’re the channel that everything’s going through. Does that 
make sense?
If you’re not again, you risk things slipping off one way or another. So you’re 
looking for attention. This is where the demos are perfect. These street 
demos we’ve been playing with – the hands, the sway, the finger vice, the 
finger lock, all that sort of stuff – are perfect because it allows you to test for 
people’s focus. 
You’ll see some people there and they’re going, whoa. You’ve seen this 
happen once or twice today, right? You’ll see some people going like this. 
Which of the two are you going to select? 
The first one.
Exactly. So these demos are called suggestibility tests, not to see whether,
or not someone will be hypnotizable or pass or fail. It’s just for you to know 
who the heck you’re going to work with. That’s it! So the two things you’re 
looking for are:
1. Speed of response. 
Students:
Igor:
Students:
Igor:

How quickly are they responding? If you say in a moment, you’ll feel 
magnets pull those hands together, boom, that’s probably a good person to 
work with. The other thing you’re looking for is, I’ll use the words…
2. Emersion of experience.
They get absorbed by the experience. It’s not just focus. Focus in part of it, 
but this is a bigger thing with the whole reality. You can see it kind of 
happening, where nothing else exists except for those hands, and they’re 
so there. Does that make sense?
You’re looking for these two things, in terms of who you’re going to select. 
Finally, once you’ve don’t the demo and you’ve had a successful result with 
at least once person in that group, and you’ve seen elements of speed and 
emersion in terms of their response, well, as far as I’m concerned, you’re 
home free. You can do anything at that point, really, within ethical limits.
Don’t come crying to me if you get arrested for, I don’t know, making 
someone into a pygmy monkey for the rest of his life. Who knows? Just 
keep it fun, keep it lighthearted and we’ll show you some cool things to do 
with that. But really, at that point, you can do whatever you want – instant 
inductions, fractionations or more demos. You can do all the class things –
sticking people around the place, that’s always a fun favorite for people. 
Even the whole routines, everything we’ll be doing tomorrow. All those 
things will be possible at that point because you’ve just opened the door 
with all this. Does that kind of make sense?
There is one last thing I’d like you to keep in mind which is what do you do if 
things go wrong, if they don’t work out any ideas?
Run! You bring them out and tell them – it’s the same as an abreaction, 
right?
Okay, I actually don’t mean an abreaction. I mean like you say, you can’t 
bend your arm and they go like this, that sort of thing.
Okay, well, in that case, you would just go to something else and keep 
trying different tests.
Here’s the simple rule. If it doesn’t work, do an instant induction, deepen, 
fractionate and do it again. I have actually done this, we did this, remember 
the guy in Missoula? Even this thing here just wasn’t working too well. It 
was like, oh bugger. 
So what happens? You put him in and you do it again and again, and you 
fractionate it and fractionate it. After about 10 minutes, he’s like this. I say

your arm is stiff and he’s going, I don’t care about my arm. I don’t even 
know who I am anymore.
Laughter
So just fractionate, fractionate, fractionate and eventually, you’ll get it. It 
may not even hold for that long if the person at that point is not 
concentrating properly or whatever it is. It’s not a big deal. It will hold long 
enough to be impressive and then you do what you suggested; run!
Really, you can’t go wrong because aren’t instant inductions easy? So just 
think in the back of your mind, wash, rise, repeat. If it hasn’t worked out, 
don’t panic. Instant induction – that’s the wash; the rinsing bit is deepening; 
repeat is you try it again. Simple, isn’t it?
That gives you a little package for street hypnosis, which is easy, it’s 
simple, it’s robust and it will pretty much work anywhere you go. Seem 
cool?

Important Group Dynamics
Igor:
What I want you to do now is get into groups of three or four people. We’re 
going to give you a little bit longer because each one’s going to have a go 
at this. Can I actually borrow four people up here on stage just so I can 
show you? Just come on up.
Now the group or whoever you’re working with, I want you to pretend like 
these guys are at a bar, they’re just chatting to know each other. All you’re 
going to do is go in and just say hey guys, what’s up? My name is Igor. I’m 
a hypnotist. You guys look like you’re having a great time. Can I just show 
you something really cool about the power of the mind. Would that be cool?
Just put your hands out like this. 
Where am I? We’ve just done exactly all we’ve been looking at here. All I’m 
doing now is working with a slightly larger group, so it feels like a little bit 
more trepidation. It’s like oh, they’re having a conversation and what if I 
interrupt? 
Look at them. They’re still there. Now you can relax. But you’re doing the 
same things. Hi, introduce yourself, I’m a hypnotist, so they know why 
you’re there. Let me show you something cool. You may even get ask their 
permission. Would it be okay if I show you something cool about the power 
of the mind, yes? Okay, put your hands like this. Thank you and just relax. 
Is that easy? So we’re going to do exactly the same thing you just did a 
moment ago, only this time we’re going to work the group dynamic and 
you’re going to be looking at those five steps.
In other words, whose got the best attitude whilst you’re doing the 
suggestion thing or whatever, who is really responding most dramatically. 
You just watch. If you’re not sure, you know what you do? Do another one, 
seriously. 
If you’re not sure – let’s say you’re doing this one and they’re all kind of 
responding okay. So you’re not sure who you’re going to choose, so you 
say okay, this time put your hands out like this. Now there are magnets 
coming closer, closer, closer. One goes like this and one’s still like this a 
half an hour later. So if you’re not sure, you just do something else. Does 
that make sense to you all?
I want you all to get a chance to experience what it feels like to walk in on a 
group of people with a big smile on your face saying hey guys, I’m a 
hypnotist. Can I show you something cool? Simple as that. Then go straight 
into your routine. Choose one person from the group. You can choose 
several, but for now just choose one person in the group. You’ll do exactly

what you did, only this time – let’s say we choose Jimmy over here – this 
time we off of the group. 
And sleep. All the way, deeper, deeper. That’s right, all the way. 
There you go. 
Now you’re going to play up to the group. 
On balance, on your own feet that’s it, nice and deep. 
Now you can play it up to the group.
Watch this, guys. Do you want to see something cool? Just stand 
back a second because this might hurt you. You’ll be nice and strong 
with this. Make it strong. Stiff and rigid, stiff and rigid, like an iron bar, 
stiff and rigid, no matter how hard you try to move it, you cannot 
bend it. No one can bend it. Try to bend that arm and notice how stiff 
and rigid it is. 
Go ahead and touch it. That’s pretty intense, isn’t it? That’s a hypno-
arm there. And relax. All the way down. All the way down. See, I 
have special hypno-powers and deeper still. Okay, wide awake. 
Eyes open. Good job. Well done, you. How do you feel about that?
So do you see how we’re playing it up for the group a little bit as well, maybe 
even have a little bit of fun with it? So you’re still involving them, you’ve just 
chosen the one person to have a little bit of fun interaction with. Easy? Give 
these guys a round of applause. Thanks, folks. 
Applause
Find a group and have a play.

How are you all doing? Good? Oh, come on, it’s the last 20 minutes. How 
are you doing?
Great!
Now I feel you. Did you enjoy that exercise?
Yes.
Can you see yourself using it in real life? I mean pretty much every piece is 
there. Here’s a hint. When you’re doing this and you want to get a good 
result, like to warm the group up, you do something like the finger vice. It’s 
pretty much a no brainer, most people will “pass it” and do well. 
Then, if you want to actually select someone, do something like this or the 
hand clasp or something like that. Why? Because you’re now looking for 
people who could be more hyper-responsive so you can do more advanced 
and crazy stuff with them. Does that make sense?
Just play the range between you. You have plenty of tools, plenty of demos 
you can do. Just mix it up and have fun with it. You can bounce from table 
to table, from venue to venue and have a lot of fun with this, would that be 
fair to say?
Now, wouldn’t it be good if we were doing all these things to have a good 
kick ass thing you can do at the end. I apologize for my language. It’s 
French. I’m European. I can’t help it. But wouldn’t it be good to have a 
slightly bleeped out thing that you can finish off as a great big finale, rather 
than just saying, there you go that was the demo, well done, yay. Wouldn’t 
that be nice to have?
Yes.
Here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to have a little piece, which is 
simple. In fact, can I have a volunteer please, someone who wants to feel 
great. Come on up. May I borrow your glasses they’ll be safe? 
You won’t be able to see through them.
That’s all right. I have my own. They’re like mine now, aren’t they? Are you 
ready for this?

And sleep, all the way, deeper, deeper, deeper that’s right. Now find 
your own balance. That’s it, going deeper and deeper still as you find 
your own balance, on your own legs, very good. Excellent! This hand 
now is stiff and rigid. Just as before, make a fist, stiff and rigid, stiff 
and rigid. Make a fist with that hand. Make a fist. Make it strong, 
stronger and stronger. 
The stronger it gets, the better you feel. The strongest this gets, the 
better you feel. The stronger this gets, the better you feel. That’s 
right. Stiff and rigid so that you can’t bend it and no one can bend 
this. As that happens, try to bend it. Try to bend it now. And relax it. 
Keep it stiff and rigid for now. 
As the arm relaxes, the fist will get tense because inside the fist, I 
want you to put a memory, a memory of something wonderful and 
charming from your past. Something you may have forgotten about. 
Something you may not have thought of in years. Feel that memory 
inside that fist, traveling up the arm into your shoulder, into your body 
and re-experience that now. Remember how good it felt. Can you do 
that now?
That’s right. Feel that memory growing stronger and stronger. Every 
time you squeeze that fist, that memory becomes stronger. Squeeze 
that fist and it becomes stronger. Squeeze that fist and it becomes 
stronger until you are positively glowing with a light. That face of 
yours will start lighting up. You might have a smile on your face. 
You’ll have this feel-good feeling inside of you, that’s right.
Remember just how good it felt to have that charming memory.
Now I want you to have something important happen. Find your own 
balance. That’s right. Find your own balance. Good. Relax the arm 
and relax the wrist. Relax the fist and that memory will fade, but the 
cool thing is as soon as you squeeze that fist, those good feelings 
come flooding back, and you might not even remember the memory 
fully. Perhaps you will. Let’s find out, shall we?
Squeeze your fist and watch those feelings come back. Isn’t that 
amazing? This is something you can take with you for the rest of 
your life, anytime you need it, that fist and your will to make it so.
You think of that fist, you think of that memory, you squeeze that fist 
and you will feel this good. Do you want to try that out now? Okay, 
relax the fist 1-2, wide awake. Open your arms. How you doing? Are 
you doing good?
That’s pretty cool, isn’t it? That’s what hypnosis can do for you. Thank you 
for sharing.

Isn’t that a charming way to leave people? So, after doing all the skits and 
the power of hypnosis, you’re actually leaving them with something that 
shows them, hey, this stuff can actually do good things. It’s a genuine force 
of good. 
I like to do little things like that as a little crescendo to it. You might too. The 
very simple thing is go on a one-to-one basis now. Find one partner and 
just have one go each, because we’re coming to the end of the night. I want 
you to select one of your little demos, whether it’s this, the hand clasp or the 
arm lock. I don’t care what it is. Once they succeed in it, I’d like you to 
attach something very positive. 
The easiest way to do this is to get them to come up with some random 
positive memory, some fun experience or happy experience from the past. 
Then bring it back to life so they can really enjoy it in the now. Simple? Add 
some fuel to the actual test working or whatever it is. I mean, sometimes 
you’ll have the energy inside their hands and that’s the energy of someone 
they truly love, and they can feel that love all over again. 
You can get as creative as you want, but the essence of it is really what we 
did today. It’s this, isn’t it? You just associate one thing to the other. Does 
that make sense to you? You’re only as constrained as your imagination is 
limited. So you may as well go beyond what you thought you could do and 
actually have fun with this. 
Are there any questions? All right, take two minutes apiece. Do that quickly. 
Come back in a positive happy glow and we’ll wrap up for the night. Off you 
go.

Are you excited?

Has today been a good day?
Yes!
Did you enjoy it?
Yes!
Have you learned something?
Yes!
Above all else, are you going to use it?
Yes!
Tonight?
Yes!
Why not? I’ve got to say, you all have been fantastic. I know today’s been 
an intense day – and it has been, hasn’t it. 
Yes.
But it’s meant to be. We want to really push your limits and push your 
energy levels. You should feel bushed right now. Some of you are probably 
thinking, it’s time to go to sleep, and that’s fine. But I recommend that even 
if you are going to go to sleep, just take a half an hour and go somewhere. 
Where are you going tonight is it the MGM or something? Is that right?
Yeah.

Hands up again those of you who are going out tonight to do a little bit of 
street hypnosis. Even if you’re not actually doing it – put your hands up so 
people can see –tag along with these guys. Make sure you grab them 
outside in the corridor. If nothing else, you’re going to have blast watching 
them to stuff, right?
Who knows, maybe you’ll get inspired to do something yourself. There’s no 
pressure. It’s just whatever you feel inspired to do. So you know you have 
been working hard, right? They’ve been working hard, haven’t they?
I think they’ve been working very hard.
And that’s a good thing. 
It’s the best thing ever.
Because when you work hard…
You get good at what you do.
And you are good at what you do know, aren’t you?
And you’re getting better.
And the better you feel about your skills…
The deeper you take people into trance.
And trance is a funny thing, isn’t it?
Because it’s about exciting the imagination.
And you get excited all the way down.
And that’s where you want to go. 
In a calm place.
Inside your mind now. 
It can be great excitement.
When everything just lets go for a moment.
And you really don’t have to think.
And why would you want to…

Everything you’ve learned today.
And it’s so natural to you.
Stimulating your brain.
And you can take it with you.
So natural…
That you’ll take it to others…

They’ve worked harder than I’ve seen anybody work in a long time.
And far be it for us to suggest that they might take anything of this and 
dream about it or do anything with it, because I think they’ve worked hard 
enough, really haven’t they.
I think so I think it’s time to just play.

I think it’s time you just go out there and let the world just take you in 
whatever way it wants to, and you just follow your instincts. Wouldn’t that be 
fair to say? Rather than us telling you what to do, you may as well just go 
out and just let your instincts guide you, right.
Bring back stories. 
And video footage. I have a camera I’ll give that to you. Hold the camera 
up. Okay, not you. We’ll have someone more alive. He’s like I’m in trance I 
don’t know what I’m doing. Look after the camera whilst he’s holding it, 
would you? Just take some footage of you guys having fun, that’s all it’s 
really about. 
Who’s going to go with us in our group?
Spartans!
It’s more like a fun thing to do, guys. Enjoy yourselves. Just go out there. 
You know the principles and really this is just principles in action, right.
Wouldn’t that be fair to say? So have a great time with it, folks. Give 
yourself a nice round of applause because you deserve it. 
Applause
Now go home. Tomorrow morning we’ll start at 9:00 on the dot, so please 
be ready to come in a little bit beforehand so that we can start getting 
everything rolled in. 
Thank you very much.
