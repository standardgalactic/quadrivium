1. Trouble Times Two
The sun was  glowing dull red  as  it slipped  down  behind the curving horizon  of  Mars,  but  Gregory
Hunter was not able to see it.
There was no viewscreen in the ship's cabin; it was too tiny for that. Greg twisted around in the cockpit
that had been built just big enough to hold him, and shifted his long legs against the brace-webbing, trying
to get them comfortable.
He knew he was afraid ... but nobody else knew that, not even the captain waiting at the control board
on the satellite, and in spite of the fear Greg Hunter would not have traded  places  at  this moment with
anyone else in the universe.
He had worked too hard and waited too long for this moment.
He heard the count-down monitor clicking in his ears, and his hands clenched into fists. How far from
Mars  would he be  ten minutes from now?  He  didn't  know.  Farther  than  any  man  had  ever  traveled
before in the space of ten minutes, he knew,  and  faster.  How  far and  how fast would depend  on him
alone.
"All set, Greg?" It was the captain's voice in the earphones.
"All set, Captain."
"You understand the program?"
Greg nodded. "Twenty-four hours out, twenty-four hours back, ninety degrees to the ecliptic, and  all
the accelleration I can stand both ways."
Greg grinned to himself. He thought of the months of conditioning he had gone through to prepare for
this run ...  the  hours  in  the  centrifuge  to  build  up  his  tolerance  to  accelleration,  the  careful  diet,  the
rigorous hours of physical conditioning. It was only one experiment, one tiny step in the work that could
someday give men the stars, but to Gregory Hunter at this moment it was everything.
"Good luck, then." The captain cut off, and the blastoff buzzer sounded.
He was off. His heart hammered in his throat, and his eyes ached fiercely, but he paid no attention. His
finger crept to the air-speed indicator, then to the cut-off switch. When the pressure became too  great,
when he began to black out, he would press it.
But not yet. It was speed they wanted; they had to know how much accelleration a man could take for
how long and still survive, and now it was up to him to show them.
Fleetingly, he thought of Tom ...  poor  old stick-in-the-mud  Tom, working  away  in  his  grubby  little
Mars-bound laboratory, watching bacteria grow. Tom could never have qualified for a job like this. Tom
couldn't even go into free-fall for ten minutes without getting sick all over the place. Greg felt a surge of
pity for his brother, and then a twinge of malicious anticipation. Wait until Tom heard the reports on this
run! It  was  all right to  spend  your time poking around  with bottles  and  test  tubes  if  you  couldn't  do
anything else, but it took something special to pilot an XP ship for Project Star-Jump. And after this run
was over, even Tom would have to admit it....
There was a lurch, and quite suddenly the enormous pressure was gone.
Something was wrong. He hadn't pushed the cut-off button, yet the ship's engines were suddenly silent.
He jabbed  at  the power  switch.  Nothing happened.  Then the side-jets  sputted,  and  he was  slammed

sideways into the cot.
He snapped on the radio speaker. "Control ... can you hear me? Something's gone wrong out here...."
"Nothing's wrong," the captain's voice said in his earphones.  "Just sit tight. I'm bringing you back  in.
There's a call here from Sun Lake City. They want you down there in a hurry. We'll have to scratch you
on this run."
"Who wants me down there?"
"The U.N. Council office. Signed by Major Briarton himself and I can't argue with the Major.  We're
bringing you in."
Greg Hunter sank back, disappointment so thick he could taste it in his mouth. Sun Lake  City! That
meant two days at least, one down, one back, maybe more if connections weren't right. It meant that the
captain would send Morton or one of the others out in his place. It meant....
Suddenly he thought of what else it meant, and a chill ran up his back.
There was  only one  reason  Major  Briarton  would call him in like this. Something had  happened  to
Dad.
Greg leaned back in the cot,  suddenly tense,  as  a  thousand  frightful possibilities flooded  his mind. It
could only mean that Dad was in some kind of trouble.
And if anything had happened to Dad....
* * * * *
The sun was sinking rapidly toward the horizon when the city finally came into sight in the distance, but
try as he would, Tom Hunter could not urge more than thirty-five miles an hour from the huge lurching
vehicle he was driving.
On an open paved highway the big pillow-wheeled  Sloppy  Joe  would do  sixty in a  breeze,  but this
desert  route  was  far  from  a  paved  road.  Inside  the  pressurized  passenger  cab,  Tom  gripped  the
shock-bars with one arm and the other leg, and jammed the accelerator to the floor. The engine coughed,
but thirty-five was all it would do.
Through the windshield Tom could see the endless rolling dunes of the Martian desert stretching to the
horizon on every side. They called Mars the Red Planet, but it was not red when you were  close  to  it.
There were multitudes of colors here ... yellow, orange, brown, gray, occasional patches of gray-green ...
all shifting and changing in the fading sunlight. Off to the right were the worn-down peaks of the Mesabi
II, one of the long, low mountain ranges of almost pure iron ore that helped  give the planet  its dull red
appearance from outer space. And behind him, near  the horizon, the tiny sun glowed  orange  out of a
blue-black sky.
Tom fought the wheel as the Sloppy Joe jounced across a dry creek bed, and swore softly to himself.
Why hadn't he kept his head and waited for the mail ship that had been due at the Lab to give him a lift
back?  He'd  have been  in Sun Lake  City an hour ago  ...  but the  urgency  of  the  message  had  driven
caution from his mind.
A summons from the Mars Coordinator of the U.N. Interplanetary Council was the same as an order
... but there was more to Tom's haste than that. There was only one reason that Major Briarton would be
calling him in to Sun Lake City, and that reason meant trouble.
Something was wrong. Something had happened to Dad.
Now Tom peered up at the dark sky, squinting into the sun. Somewhere out there between Mars and
Jupiter was a no-man's-land of danger, a great circling ring of space dirt and  debris,  the Asteroid  belt.
And somewhere out there, Dad was working.
Tom thought for a moment of the pitiful little mining rig that Roger Hunter had taken out to the Belt ...
the tiny orbit-ship to be used for headquarters  and  storage  of the ore;  the even tinier scout  ship, Pete
Racely's  old Scavenger  that he had  sold  to  Roger  Hunter for back  taxes  and  repairs  when  he  went
broke in the Belt looking for his Big Strike. It wasn't much of a mining rig for anybody  to  use,  and  the

dangers  of a  small mining operation  in the Asteroid  Belt were  frightening. It  took  skill to  bring a  little
scout-ship in for a landing on an asteroid rock hardly bigger than the ship itself; it took even more skill to
rig the controlled-Murexide  charges  to  blast  the rock  into  tiny  fragments,  and  then  run  out  the  shiny
magnetic net to catch the explosion debris and bring it in to the hold of the orbit-ship....
Tom  Hunter  scowled,  trying  to  shake  off  the  feeling  of  uneasiness  that  was  nibbling  at  his  mind.
Asteroid mining was  dangerous  ...  but Dad  was  no novice.  Nobody  on Mars  knew  how to  handle a
mining rig better than Roger Hunter did. He knew what he was doing out there, there was no real danger
for him or was there....
Roger Hunter, a good man, a gentle and peaceful man, had finally seen all he could stomach of Jupiter
Equilateral and  its company  mining policies  six  months  before.  He  had  told  them  so  in  plain,  simple
language when he turned in his resignation. They didn't try to stop him ... a man was still free to quit a job
on Mars if he wanted to, even a job with Jupiter Equilateral. But it was an open secret that the big mining
outfit had not liked Roger Hunter's way of resigning, taking half a dozen of their first-rate mining engineers
with him. There had been veiled threats, rumors of attempts to close the markets to Roger Hunter's ore,
in open violation of U.N. Council policies on Mars....
Tom fought the wheel as the big tractor lumbered up another rise, and the huge plastic bubble of Sun
Lake City came into view far down the valley below.
He thought of Greg.  Had  Greg  been  summoned too?  He  closed  his lips tightly as  a  wave  of  anger
passed through his mind. If anything had happened, no matter  what,  he thought, Greg  would be  there.
Taking over and running things, as usual. He thought of the last time he had  seen  his brother,  and  then
deliberately blocked out the engulfing bitterness.
That had been more than a year ago. Maybe Greg had changed since then.
But somehow, Tom didn't think so.
The Sloppy  Joe  was  on the valley floor now,  and  ahead  the bubble  covering the city  was  drawing
closer. The sun was almost gone; lights were appearing inside the plastic  shielding. Born  and  raised  on
Mars, Tom had seen the teeming cities of Earth only once in his life ... but to him none of the splendors of
the Earth cities could match the simple, quiet beauty of this Martian outpost settlement. There had been a
time when people had said that Sun Lake City could never be built, that it could never survive if it were,
but with each successive year it grew larger and stronger, the headquarters  city for the planet  that  had
become the new frontier of Earth.
The radiophone buzzed, and the airlock guard hailed him when he returned  the signal. Tom gave his
routine ID. He guided the tractor into the lock, waited until pressure and atmosphere rose to normal, and
then leaped out of the cab.
Five minutes later he was walking across the lobby of the Interplanetary Council building, stepping into
the down elevator. Three flights below he stepped out into the office corridor of the U.N. Interplanetary
Council on Mars.
If there was trouble, this was where he would find it.
He paused for a minute before the gray plastic door marked MAJOR FRANK BRIARTON in raised
stainless steel letters. Then he pushed open the door and walked into the ante-room.
It was empty. Suddenly he felt a touch on his shoulder. Behind him, a familiar voice said, "Hello, Twin."
* * * * *
At first glance they looked like carbon copies of each other, although they were no more identical than
identical twins ever are. Greg stood a good two inches taller than Tom. His shoulders were broad, and
there was a small gray scar over one eye that stood out in contrast to the healthy tanned color of his face.
Tom was of slighter build, and wirier, his skin much more pale.
But they had the same dark hair, the same gray eyes, the same square, stubborn line to the jaw. They
looked at each other for a moment without speaking. Then Greg grinned and clapped his brother on the

shoulder.
"So you got here, finally," he said. "I was beginning to think I'd have to go out on the desert and  find
you."
"Oh, I got here, all right," Tom said. "I see you did too."
"Yes," Greg said heavily. "Can't argue with the major, you know."
"But what does he want?"
"How should I know? All he said was to get down here fast. And now he isn't even here himself."
"Is Dad on Mars?" Tom asked.
Greg looked at him. "I don't know."
"We could check the register."
"I already checked it. He has not logged in, but that doesn't mean anything."
"I suppose not," Tom said glumly.
They were silent for a moment. Then Greg said, "Look, what are you worried  about?  Nothing could
have happened to Dad. He's been mining the Belt for years."
"I know. I just wish he were here, that's all. If he's in some kind of trouble...."
"What kind of trouble? You're looking for spooks."
"Spooks like Jupiter Equilateral, maybe," Tom said. "They could make plenty of trouble for Dad."
"With the U.N. in the driver's seat here? They wouldn't dare. Why do you think the major rides them
so hard with all the claim-filing regulations? He'd give his right arm for a chance to break that outfit into
pieces."
"I still wish somebody had gone out to the Belt with Dad," Tom said.
Just then the door opened. The newcomer was a tall, gray-haired man with U.N. Council stripes on his
lapel, and major's rockets on his shoulders. "Sorry I'm late, boys," Major Briarton said. "I'd hoped to be
here when you arrived. I'm sorry to pull you in here like this, but I'm afraid I had no choice.  When did
you boys hear from your father last?"
They looked at each other. "I saw him six weeks ago," Tom said. "Just before he left to go out to the
Belt again."
"Nothing since then?"
"Not a word."
The major chewed his lip. "Greg?"
"I had a note at Christmas, I think. But what...."
"What did he say in the note?"
"He said Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. Dad isn't much of a letter writer."
"Nothing at all about what he was doing?"
Greg shook his head. "Look, Major, if there's some sort of trouble...."
"Yes, I'm afraid there's trouble," the major said. He looked up at them, and spread his hands helplessly.
"There isn't any easy way to tell you, but you've got to know. There's been an accident, out in the Belt."
"Accident?" Greg said.
"A very serious  accident.  A  fuel  tank  exploded  in  the  scooter  your  father  was  riding  back  to  the
Scavenger. It must have been very sudden, and by the time help arrived...." The major broke off, unable
to find words.
For  a  long  moment  there  was  utter  silence  in  the  room.  Outside,  an  elevator  was  buzzing,  and  a
typewriter clicked monotonously somewhere in the building.
Then Tom Hunter broke the silence. "Who was it, Major?" he said. "Who killed Dad? Tell us, or we'll

find out!"
2. Jupiter Equilateral
For a moment, Major Briarton just stared at him. Then he was on his feet, shaking his head as he came
around the desk. "Tom, use your head," he said. "It's as much of a shock to me as it is to you, but you
can't afford to jump to false conclusions...."
Tom Hunter looked up bitterly. "He's dead, isn't he?"
"Yes, he's dead. He must have died the instant of the explosion...."
"You mean you don't know?"
"I wasn't there at the time it happened, no."
"Then who was?"
* * * * *
Major  Briarton  spread  his hands  helplessly. "Nobody  was.  Your  father  was  alone.  From  what  we
could tell later,  he'd  left the Scavenger  to  land on one  of his claims, using  the  ship's  scooter  for  the
landing. He was on the way back to the Scavenger when the rear tank exploded. There wasn't enough
left of it to tell what went wrong ...  but it was  an accident,  there  was  no evidence  to  suggest anything
else."
Tom looked at him. "You really believe that?"
"I can only tell you what we found."
"Well, I don't believe it for a minute," Tom said angrily. "How long have you and  Dad  been  friends?
Twenty years? Twenty-five? Do you really think Dad would have an accident with a mining rig?"
"I know he was an expert engineer," the major said. "But things can happen that even an expert can't
foresee, mining in the Belt."
"Things like a fuel tank exploding? Not to Dad, they would never happen. I don't care what anybody
says...."
"Easy, Tom," Greg said.
"Well, I won't  take  it  easy.  Dad  was  too  careful  for  something  like  that  to  happen.  If  he  had  an
accident, somebody made it happen."
Greg turned to the major. "What was Dad doing out there?"
"Mining."
"By himself? No crew at all?"
"No, he was alone."
"I thought the regulations said there always had to be at least two men working an asteroid claim."
"That's right. Your father had Johnny Coombs with him when he left Sun Lake City. They signed out as
a team ... and then Johnny came back to Mars on the first shuttle ship."
"How come?"
"Not even Johnny knows. Your father just sent him back, and there was nothing we could do about it
then. The U.N. has no jurisdiction in the belt, unless a major crime has been committed." Major Briarton
shook his head helplessly. "If a man is determined to mine a claim all by himself out there, he can find a
dozen different ways to wiggle out of the regulations."
"But Dad would never be that stupid," Greg said. "If he was alone when it happened, who found him?"
"A routine U.N. Patrol ship. When Roger failed to check in at the regular eight-hour signal, they went
out to see what was wrong. But by the time they reached him, it was too late to help."
"I just don't get it," Greg said. "Dad had more sense than to try to mine out there all by himself."
"I know," the major  said.  "I don't  know  the answer.  I had  the Patrol  ship go over  the scene  of the

accident with a comb after they found what had happened, but there was nothing there to find. It was an
accident, and that's that."
"What about Jupiter Equilateral?" Tom said hotly. "Everybody knows they were out to get Dad ... why
don't you find out what they were doing when it happened, bring them in for questioning...."
"I can't do that, I haven't a scrap of evidence," the major said wearily.
"Why can't you? You're the Mars Coordinator, aren't you? You act like you're scared of them."
Major Briarton's  lips tightened angrily. "All right, since you put it that  way ...  I am  scared  of them.
They're big, and they're powerful. If they had their way, there wouldn't be any United Nations control on
Mars,  there  wouldn't  be  anybody  to  fight  them  and  keep  them  in  check.  There  wouldn't  be  any
independent miners out in the Belt, either, because they'd all be bought out or dead, and Earth would pay
through the nose for every ounce of metal that they got from the Asteroid Belt. That company has been
trying to drive the U.N. off Mars for thirty years, and they've come so close to it that it scares me plenty."
He pushed his chair back sharply and rose to his feet. "And that is exactly why I refuse to stir up a mess
over this thing, unhappy as it is, without something more than suspicions and  rumors to  back  me up ...
because  all Jupiter  Equilateral needs  is one  big issue to  make  us look  like  fools  out  here,  and  we're
through."
He crossed the room to a wall cabinet, opened it, and pulled out a scarred aluminum box. "We found
this in the cabin of the Scavenger. I thought you boys might want it."
They both recognized it instantly ... the battered old spacer's pack that Roger Hunter had used for as
long as they could remember. It seemed to them, suddenly, as if a part of him had appeared here in the
room with them. Greg looked at the box and turned away. "You open it," he said to Tom in a sick voice.
There was nothing much inside ... some clothing, a pipe and tobacco pouch, a jack knife, half a dozen
other items so familiar that Tom could  hardly bear  to  touch  them. At the bottom  of the pack  was  the
heavy leather gun case which had always held Roger Hunter's ancient .44 revolver. Tom dropped it back
without even opening the flap. He closed the box and took a deep breath. "Then you really believe that it
was an accident and nothing more?" he said to the major.
Major Briarton shook his head. "What I think or don't think doesn't make any difference. It just doesn't
matter. In order to do anything, I've got to have evidence, and there just isn't any evidence. I can't even
take a ship out there for a second look, with the evidence I have, and that's all there is to it."
"But you think that maybe it wasn't an accident, just the same," Tom pursued.
The major hesitated. Then he shook his head again. "I'm sorry, but I've got to stand on what I've said.
And I think you'd better stand on it, too. There's nothing else to be done."
* * * * *
It should have been enough, but it wasn't.  As  Tom Hunter walked  with his brother  down  the broad
Upper Ramp to  the business  section  of Sun Lake  City,  he could  not shake  off the feeling of helpless
anger, the growing conviction that Roger Hunter's death involved something more than the tragic accident
in space that Major Briarton had insisted it was.
"He didn't tell us everything he knew," Tom said fiercely. "He didn't say everything he wanted to  say,
either. He doesn't think it was an accident any more than I do."
"How do you know, are you a mind reader?"
"No."
"Well, Dad  wasn't  a  superman,  either.  He  was  taking an awful risk,  trying to  work  a  mining  rig  by
himself, and he had a bad break. Why do you have to have somebody to blame for it?"
"Keep talking," Tom said. "You'll convince yourself yet."
Greg just jammed his hands in his pockets, and they walked in silence for a moment.
For Tom and Greg Hunter, Sun Lake City had always been home. Now they walked along the Main

Concourse, Tom with the aluminum box under his arm, Greg with his own spacer's pack thrown over his
shoulder. They didn't talk; rather than being drawn closer by the news of the tragedy, it seemed that they
had drawn farther apart, as though the one common link that had held them together had suddenly been
broken.
Finally Tom broke the silence. "At least there's one thing we can do," he said. "I'm going to call Johnny
Coombs."
He shortly found a phone booth and dialed a number. Johnny had been a friend of the family for years;
he and Roger Hunter had been partners in many mining ventures in the Asteroid Belt before Roger had
taken his position with Jupiter Equilateral. If Johnny had any suspicions that Roger Hunter's accident had
been more than an accident, he certainly would not hesitate to voice them....
After a dozen rings, Tom hung up, tried another number. There was no answer there, either. Frowning,
Tom rang the city's central paging system. "Put in a personal call for Johnny Coombs," he said when the
"record" signal flashed on. "Tell him to contact the Hunters when he comes in. We'll be at home...."
They resumed their silent walk. When they reached H wing on the fourth level, they turned right down
an apartment  corridor,  and  stopped  in front of a  familiar doorway.  Tom pressed  his palm against the
lock-plate, and the door swung open.
It was home to them, the only home they had  ever  known.  Soft  lights sprang  up on the walls of the
apartment as the door opened. Tom saw the old bookcases lining the walls, the drafting-board and light
at the far end of the room, the simple chairs and dining table, the door which led into the bedroom and
kitchen beyond. The room had the slightly disheveled look that it had had ever since Mom had died ... a
slipper on the floor here, a book face down on the couch there....
It looked as though Dad had just stepped out for an hour or so.
Tom was three steps into the room before he saw the visitor.
The man was sitting comfortably in Roger Hunter's easy chair, a short, fat man with round pink cheeks
that sagged a  little and  a  double  chin that rested  on his neck  scarf.  There  were  two  other  men in the
room,  both  large  and  broad-shouldered;  one  of  them  nodded  to  the  fat  man,  and  moved  to  stand
between the boys and the door.
The fat man was out of his seat before the boys could speak, smiling at them and holding out his hand.
"I wanted to be sure to see you before you left the city," he was saying, "so we just came on in to wait. I
hope you don't mind our ... butting in, so to speak." He  chuckled,  looking from one  twin to  the other.
"You don't know me, I suppose. I'm Merrill Tawney. Representing Jupiter Equilateral, you know."
Tom took the card he was holding out, looked at the name and the tiny gold symbol in the corner,  a
letter "J" in the center of a triangle. He handed the card to Greg. "I've seen you before," he told  the fat
man. "What do you want with us?"
Tawney smiled again, spreading  his hands.  "We've  heard  about  the tragedy,  of course.  A  shocking
thing ... Roger was one of our group so recently. We wanted you to know that if there is anything at all
we can do to help, we'd be only too glad...."
"Thanks," Greg said. "But we're doing just fine."
Tawney's smile tightened a little, but he hung onto it. "I always felt close to your father," he said. "All of
us at Jupiter Equilateral did. We were all sorry to see him leave."
"I bet you were," Greg said, "he was the best mining engineer you ever had. But Dad could never stand
liars, or crooked ways of doing business."
One of the men started for Greg, but the fat man stopped him with a wave of his hand. "We had our
differences of opinion," he said. "We saw things one way, your father saw them another way. But he was
a fine man, one of the finest...."
"Look,  Mr.  Tawney,  you'd  better  say  what  you  came  to  say  and  get  out  of  here,"  Greg  said
dangerously, "before we give your friends here something to do."

"I merely came to offer you some help," Tawney said. He was no longer smiling. "Since your father's
death, you two have acquired certain responsibilities. I thought we might relieve you of some of them."
"What sort of responsibilities?"
"You have an unmanned orbit-ship which is now a derelict in the Asteroid Belt. You have a scout-ship
out there also. You can't just leave them there as a navigation hazard to every ship traveling in the sector.
There are also a few mining claims which aren't going to be of much value to you now."
"I see," Greg said. "Are you offering to buy Dad's mining rig?"
"Well, I doubt very much that we'd have any use for it, as such. But we could save you the trouble of
going out there to haul it in."
"That's very thoughtful," Greg said. "How much are you offering?"
Tom looked up in alarm. "Wait a minute," he said. "That rig's not for sale...."
"How much?" Greg repeated.
"Forty thousand dollars," Merrill Tawney said. "Ship, rig and claims. We'll even pay the transfer tax."
Tom stared at the man, wondering if he had heard right. He knew what Roger Hunter had paid for the
rig; he had been with Dad when the papers were signed. Tawney's offer was three times as much as the
rig was worth.
But Greg was shaking his head. "I don't think we could sell at that price."
The fat man's hands  fluttered.  "You understand  that  those  ships are  hardly suited to  a  major  mining
operation like ours," he said, "and the claims...." He dismissed them with a wave of his hand. "Still, we'd
want you to be happy with the price. Say, forty-five thousand?"
Greg hesitated, shook his head again. "I guess we'd better think it over, Mr. Tawney."
"Fifty thousand is absolutely the top," Tawney said sharply. "I have the papers right here, drawn up for
your signatures, but I'm afraid we can't hold the offer open."
"I don't know, we might want to do some mining ourselves," Greg said. "For all we know, Dad might
have struck some rich ore on one of those claims."
Tawney  laughed.  "I  hardly  think  so.  Those  claims  were  all  Jupiter  Equilateral  rejects.  Our  own
engineers found nothing but low grade ore on any of them."
"Still, it might be fun to look."
"It  could  be  very  expensive  fun.  Asteroid  mining  is  a  dangerous  business,  even  for  experts.  For
amateurs...." Tawney spread his hands. "Accidents occur...."
"Yes, we've heard about those accidents," Greg said coldly. "I don't think we're quite ready to sell, Mr.
Tawney. We may never be ready to sell to you, so don't stop breathing until we call you. Now if there's
nothing else, why don't you take your friends and go somewhere else?"
The  fat  man  scowled;  he  started  to  say  something  more,  then  saw  the  look  on  Greg's  face,  and
shrugged. "I'd advise you to give it some careful thought," he said as he started for the door. "It might be
very foolish for you to try to use that rig."
Smiling, Greg  closed  the door  in his face.  Then he turned  and  winked  at  Tom.  "Great  fellow,  Mr.
Tawney. He almost had me sold."
"So I noticed," Tom said. "For a while I thought you were serious."
"Well, we found out how high they'd go. That's a very generous outfit Mr. Tawney works for."
"Or else a very crooked one," Tom said. "Are you wondering the same thing I'm wondering?"
"Yes," Greg said slowly. "I think I am."
"Then that makes three of us," a heavy voice rumbled from the bedroom door.
* * * * *
Johnny Coombs was a tall man, so thin he was almost gangling, with a long nose and shaggy eyebrows

jutting out over his eyes. With his rudely cropped hair and his huge hands, he looked like a caricature of a
frontier Mars-farmer, but the blue eyes under the eyebrows were not dull.
"Johnny!" Tom cried. "We were trying to find you."
"I know," Johnny said. "So have a lot of other people, includin' your friends there."
"Well, did you hear what Tawney wanted?"
"I'm not so quick on my feet any more," Johnny Coombs said, "but I got nothin' wrong with my ears."
He scratched  his jaw  and  looked  up sharply at  Greg.  "Not  many  people  nowadays  get  a  chance  to
bargain with Merrill Tawney."
Greg shrugged. "He named a price and I didn't like it."
"Three times what the rig is worth," Coombs said.
"That's what I didn't like," Greg said. "That outfit wouldn't give us a break like that just for old times'
sake. Do you think they would?"
"Well, I don't know," Johnny said slowly. "Back before they built the city here, they used to have rats
getting into the grub. Came right down off the ships. Got rid of most of them, finally, but it seems to me
we've still got some around, even if they've got different shapes now." He jerked his thumb toward  the
bedroom door. "In case you're wondering, that's  why I was  standin'  back  there  all this time ...  just to
make sure you didn't sell out to Tawney no matter what price he offered."
Tom jumped up excitedly. "Then you know something about Dad's accident!"
"No, I can't say I do. I wasn't there."
"Do you really think it was an accident?"
"Can't prove it wasn't."
"But at least you've got some ideas," Tom said.
"Takes more than ideas to make a case," he said at length. "But there's one thing I do know. I've got no
proof, not a shred of it, but I'm sure of one thing just as sure as I'm on Mars."  He  looked  at  the twins
thoughtfully. "Your  dad  wasn't  just  prospecting,  out  in  the  Belt.  He'd  run  onto  something  out  there,
something big."
The twins looked at him. "Run onto something?" Greg said. "You mean...."
"I mean I think your dad hit a Big Strike out there, rich metal, a real bonanza lode. Maybe the biggest
strike that's ever been made," the miner said  slowly. "And then somebody  got to  him before  he could
bring it in."
3. Too Many Warnings
For a moment, neither of the boys could say anything at all.
From the time they had learned to talk, they had heard stories and tales that the miners and prospectors
told about the Big Strike, the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, the wonderful, elusive goal of every
man who had ever taken a ship into the Asteroid Belt.
For almost a hundred and fifty years ... since the earliest days of space exploration ... there had been
miners prospecting in the Asteroids. Out there, beyond the orbit of Mars and inside the orbit of Jupiter,
were a hundred thousand ... maybe a hundred million, for all anybody knew ... chunks of rock, metal and
debris, spinning in silent orbit around the sun. Some few of the Asteroids were big enough to  be  called
planets ... Ceres, five hundred miles in diameter; Juno, Vesta, Pallas, half a dozen more. A few hundred
others, ranging in size from ten to a hundred miles in diameter,  had  been  charted  and  followed in their
orbits  by  the  observatories,  first  from  Earth's  airless  Moon,  then  from  Mars.  There  were  tens  of
thousands more that had never been charted.  Together  they made  up the Asteroid  Belt, spread  out in
space like a broad road around the sun, echoing the age-old call of the bonanza.
For there was wealth in the Asteroids ... wealth beyond a man's wildest dreams ... if only he could find
it.

Earth, with its depleted iron ranges, its exhausted tin and copper mines, and its burgeoning population,
was  hungry  for  metal.  Earth  needed  steel,  tin,  nickel,  and  zinc;  more  than  anything,  Earth  needed
ruthenium, the rare-earth catalyst that made the huge solar energy converters possible.
Mars was rich in the ores of these metals ... but the ores were buried deep in the ground. The cost of
mining them, and  of  lifting  the  heavy  ore  from  Mars'  gravitational  field  and  carrying  it  to  Earth  was
prohibitive. Only the finest carbon steel, and the radioactive  metals,  smelted  and  purified on Mars  and
transported to Earth, could be made profitable.
But from the Asteroid Belt, it was a different story. There was no gravity to fight on the tiny asteroids.
On these chunks of debris, the metals lay close to the surface,  easy  to  mine. Ships  orbiting in the Belt
could fill their holds with their precious  metal cargoes  and  transfer  them in space  to  the interplanetary
orbit-ships spinning back toward Earth. It  was  hard  work,  and  dangerous  work;  most of the ore  was
low-grade,  and  brought  little  return.  But  always  there  was  the  lure  of  the  Big  Strike,  the  lode  of
almost-pure metal that could bring a fortune back to the man who found it.
* * * * *
A few such strikes had been made. Forty years before a single claim had brought its owner seventeen
million dollars  in two  years.  A dozen  other  men  had  stumbled  onto  fortunes  in  the  Belt  ...  but  such
metal-rich fragments were grains of sand in a mighty river. For  every  man who found one,  a  thousand
others spent years looking and then perished in the fruitless search.
And now Johnny Coombs was telling them that their father had been one of that incredible few.
"You really think Dad hit a bonanza lode out there?"
"That's what I said."
"Did you see it with your own eyes?"
"No."
"You weren't even out there with him!"
"No."
"Then why are you so sure he found something?"
"Because he told me so," Johnny Coombs said quietly.
The boys looked at each other. "He actually said he'd found a rich lode?" Tom asked eagerly.
"Not exactly," Johnny said.  "Matter  of fact,  he never  actually told  me what  he'd  found. He  needed
somebody to sign aboard the Scavenger with him in order to get a clearance to blast off, but he never
did plan to take me out there with him. 'I can't take you now, Johnny,' he told me. 'I've found something
out there, but I've got to work it alone for a while.' I asked him what he'd found, and he just gave me that
funny little grin of his and said, 'Never mind what it is, it's big enough for both of us. You just keep your
mouth shut, and  you'll find out soon  enough.'  And then he wouldn't  say  another  word  until  we  were
homing in on the shuttle ship to drop me off."
Johnny finished his coffee and pushed the cup aside. "I knew he wasn't joking. He was excited, and I
think he was scared, too. Just before I left him, he said, 'There's one other thing, Johnny. Things might not
work out quite the way I figure them, and if they don't ... make sure the twins know what I've told you.' I
told him I would, and headed back. That was the last I heard from him until the Patrol  ship found him
floating in space with a torn-open suit and a ruined scooter floating a few miles away."
"Do you think that Jupiter Equilateral knew Dad had found something?" Tom asked.
"Who knows? I'm sure that he never told them, but it's awful hard to keep a secret like that, and they
sound awful eager to buy that rig," Johnny Coombs said.
"Yes, and it doesn't make sense. I mean, if they were responsible for Dad's accident, why didn't they
just check in for him on schedule and then quietly bring in their rig to jump the claim?"
"Maybe they couldn't find it," Johnny said. "If they'd  killed your dad,  they wouldn't  have dared  hang

around very long right then. Even if they'd kept the signal going, a Patrol ship might have come into the
region  any  time.  And  if  a  U.N.  Patrol  ship  ever  caught  them  working  a  dead  man's  claim  without
reporting the dead man, the suit would really start  to  leak."  Johnny shook  his head.  "Remember, your
Dad had a dozen claims out there. They might have had to scout the whole works to find the right one.
Much easier to do it out in the open, with your signatures on a claim transfer. But one thing is sure ... if
they knew what Roger found out there, and  where  it was,  Tawney would never  be  offering you triple
price for the rig."
"Then whatever Dad found is still out there," Tom said.
"I'd bet my last dime on it."
"There  might  even  be  something  to  show  that  the  accident  wasn't  an  accident,"  Tom  went  on.
"Something even the Major would have to admit was evidence."
Johnny Coombs pursed his lips, looking up at Tom. "Might be," he conceded.
"Well, what are we waiting for? We turned Tawney's offer down ... he might be sending a crew out to
jump the claim right now."
"If he hasn't already," Johnny said.
"Then we've got to get out there."
Johnny turned to Greg. "You could pilot us out and handle the navigation, and as for Tom...."
"As for Tom, he could get sick all over the place and keep us busy just taking care of him," Greg said
sourly. "You and me, yes. Not Tom. You don't know that boy in a spaceship."
Tom started to his feet, glaring at his brother. "That's got nothing to do with it...."
"It's true, isn't it? You'd be a big help out there."
Johnny looked at Tom. "You always get sick in free fall?"
"Look, let's be reasonable," Greg said. "You'd just be in the way. There are plenty of things you could
do right here, and Johnny and I could handle the rig alone...."
Tom faced his brother angrily. "If you think I'm going to stay  here  and  keep  myself company,  you're
crazy," he said. "This is one show you're not going to run, so just quit trying. If you go out there, I go."
Greg shrugged. "Okay, Twin. It's your stomach, not mine."
"Then let me worry about it."
"I hope," Johnny said, "that that's the worst we have to worry about. Let's get started planning."
* * * * *
Time was the factor  uppermost  in their minds. They knew  that  even under  the best  of conditions,  it
could take weeks to outfit and prepare for a run out to the Belt. A ship had to be leased and fueled; there
were supplies to lay in. There was the problem of clearance  to  take  care  of,  claims to  be  verified and
spotted, orbit coordinates to be computed and checked ... a thousand details to be dealt with, anyone of
which might delay embarkation from an hour to a day or more.
It was not surprising that Tom and Greg were dubious when Johnny told them they could be ready to
clear ground in less than twenty-four  hours.  Even knowing that  Merrill Tawney  might  already  have  a
mining crew at work on Roger Hunter's claims, they could not believe that  the red  tape  of preparation
and clearance could be cut away so swiftly.
They underestimated Johnny Coombs.
Six hours after he left them, he was back with a signed lease giving them the use of a  scout-ship  and
fuel to take them out to the Belt and back again; the ship was in the Sun Lake City racks waiting for them
whenever they were ready.
"What kind of a ship?" Greg wanted to know.
"A Class III Flying Dutchman with overhauled atomics and  hydrazine side-jets,"  Johnny said,  waving

the transfer order. "Think you can fly it?"
Greg  whistled.  "Can  I?  I  trained  in  a  Dutchman  ...  just  about  the  fastest  scouter  there  is.  What
condition?"
"Lousy ... but it's fueled, with six weeks' supplies in the hold, and it doesn't cost us a cent. Courtesy of
a friend. You'll have to check it over, but it'll do."
They inspected the ship, a weatherbeaten scouter that looked like a relic of the '90's. Inside there were
signs of many refittings and  overhauls,  but the atomics  were  well shielded,  and  it  carried  a  surprising
chemical fuel auxiliary for the cabin size. Greg disappeared into the engine room,  and  Tom and  Johnny
left him testing valves and  circuits while they headed  down  to  the U.N.  Registry  office  in  the  control
tower.
On the way Johnny outlined the remaining outfitting steps.  Tom would be  responsible  for getting the
clearance permit through Registry; Johnny would check out all supplies, and then contact the observatory
for the orbit coordinates of Roger Hunter's claims.
"I thought the orbits were mapped on the claim papers," Tom said. "I mean, every time an asteroid is
claimed, the orbit has to be charted...."
"That's right, but the orbit goes all the way around the sun. We know where the Scavenger was when
the Patrol ship found her ... but she's been travelling in orbit ever since. The observatory  computer  will
pinpoint her for us and chart a collision course so we can cut out and meet her instead of trailing her for a
week. Do you have the crew-papers Greg and I signed?"
"Right here."
They were stepping off the ramp below the ship when a man loomed up out of the shadows. It was a
miner Tom had never seen before. Johnny nodded as he approached. "Any news, Jack?"
"Quiet as a church," the man said.
"We'll be held up another eight hours at least," Johnny said. "Don't go to sleep on us, Jack."
"Don't worry about us sleepin'," the man said grimly. "There's been nobody around but yourselves, so
far ... except the clearance inspector."
Johnny looked up sharply. "You check his papers?"
"And his prints. He was all right."
Johnny took Tom's arm, and they headed through the gate toward the control tower. "I guess I'm just
naturally suspicious," he grinned, "but I'd sure hate to have a broken cut-off switch, or a fuel valve go out
of whack at just the wrong moment."
"You think Tawney would dare to try something here?" Tom said.
"Never hurts to check. We've got our hands full for a few hours getting set, so I just asked my friends
to keep an eye on things. Always did say that a man who's going to gamble is smart to cover his bets."
At the control tower they parted, and Tom walked into the clearance office. Johnny's watch-man had
startled him, and for the first time he felt a chill of apprehension. If they were right ... if this trip to the Belt
were not a wild goose chase from the very start ... then Roger Hunter's accident had been no accident at
all.
Quite suddenly, Tom felt very thankful that Johnny Coombs had friends....
* * * * *
"I don't like it," the Major said, facing Tom and Greg across the desk in the U.N. Registry office below
the control tower. "You've gotten an idea in your heads, and you just won't listen to reason."
Somewhere  above  them, Tom could  hear  the  low-pitched  rumble  of  a  scout-ship  blasting  from  its
launching rack. "All we want to do is go out and work Dad's claim," he said for the second time.
"I know perfectly well what you want to do, that's why I told the people here to alert me if you tried to
clear a ship. You don't know what you're doing ... and I'm not going to sign those clearance papers."

"Why not?" Greg said.
"Because you're going out there asking for trouble, that's why not."
"But you told us before that there wasn't any trouble. Dad had an accident, that was all. So how could
we get in trouble?"
The Major's face was an angry red. He started to say something, then stopped, and scowled at them
instead. They met his stare. Finally he threw up his hands. "All right, so I can't legally stop you," he said.
"But at least I can beg you to use your heads. You're wasting time and money on a foolish idea. You're
walking into dangers and risks that you can't handle, and I hate to see it happen.
"Mining in the Belt is a job for experienced men, not rank novices."
"Johnny Coombs is no novice."
"No, but he's lost his wits, taking you two out there."
"Well, are there any other dangers you have in mind?"
Once more the Major searched for words, and failed to find them. "No," he sighed, "and you wouldn't
listen if I did."
"It seems everybody  is warning us about  how dangerous  this trip is likely to  be,"  Greg  said  quietly.
"Last night it was Merrill Tawney. He offered to buy us out, he was so eager for a deal that he offered us
a fantastic price. Then Johnny tells us that Dad mined some rich ore when he was  out there  on his last
trip, but never got a chance to bring it in because of his ... accident. Up until now I haven't been so sure
Dad didn't just have an accident, but now I'm beginning to wonder. Too many people have been warning
us...."
"You're determined to go out there, then?"
"That's about right."
The Major picked up the clearance papers, glanced at them quickly, and signed them. "All right, you're
cleared. I hate to do it, but I suppose I'd go with you if the law would let me. And I'll tell you one thing ...
if you can  find a  single particle  of evidence  that  will  link  Jupiter  Equilateral  or  anybody  else  to  your
father's death, I'll use all the power I have to break them." He handed the papers back to Tom. "But be
careful, because if Jupiter Equilateral is involved in it, they're going to play dirty."
At the door he turned. "Good trip, and good luck."
Tom folded the papers and stuck them thoughtfully into his pocket.
They met Johnny Coombs  in  the  Registry  offices  upstairs;  Tom  patted  his  pocket  happily.  "We're
cleared in forty-five minutes," he said.
Johnny grinned. "Then we're all set." They headed up the ramp, reached ground level, and started out
toward the launching racks.
At the far end of the field a  powerful Class  I Ranger,  one  of the Jupiter  Equilateral scout  fleet, was
settling down into its slot in a perfect landing maneuver. The triangle-and-J-insignia  gleamed brightly on
her dark  hull. She  was  a  rich,  luxurious-looking  ship.  Many  miners  on  Mars  could  remember  when
Jupiter Equilateral had  been  nothing  more  than  a  tiny  mining  company  working  claims  in  the  remote
"equilateral"  cluster  of  asteroids  far  out  in  Jupiter's  orbit.  Gradually  the  company  had  grown  and
flourished, accumulating wealth and power as it grew, leaving behind it a thousand half-confirmed stories
of cheating, piracy, murder and theft. Other small mining outfits had fallen by the wayside until now over
two-thirds of all asteroid mining claims were held by Jupiter Equilateral, and the small independent miners
were forced more and more to take what was left.
They reached the gate to the Dutchman's launching slot and entered.
Inside the ship Tom and Johnny strapped down while Greg made his final check-down on the engines,
gyros and wiring. The cabin was a tiny vault, with none of the spacious "living room" of the orbit-ships.
Tom leaned back in the accelleration cot, and listened to the count-down signals that came at one minute

intervals now. In the earphones he could hear the sporadic chatter between Greg and the control tower.
No hint that this was anything but a routine blastoff....
But there  was  trouble  ahead,  Tom was  certain  of that.  Everybody  on Mars  was  aware  that  Roger
Hunter's sons were heading out to the Belt to pick up where he had left off. Greg had secured a leave of
absence from Project Star-Jump ... unhappily granted, even though his part in their program had already
been disrupted. Even they had heard the rumors that were adrift....
And if there was trouble now, they were on their own. The Asteroid Belt was a wilderness, untracked
and unexplored, and except for an almost insignificant fraction, completely unknown. If there was trouble
out there, there would be no one to help.
Somewhere below the engines roared, and Tom felt the weight on his chest, sudden and breath-taking.
They were on their way.
4. "Between Mars and Jupiter...."
After all the tension of preparing for it, the trip out seemed interminable.
They were all impatient to reach their destination. During blastoff and  accelleration  they had  watched
Mars dwindle to a tiny red dot; then time seemed  to  stop  altogether,  and  there  was  nothing to  do  but
wait.
For the first eight hours of free fall, after  the engines had  cut out,  Tom was  violently ill. He  fought it
desperately,  gulping the pills Johnny offered  and  trying  to  keep  them  down.  Gradually  the  waves  of
nausea subsided, but it was a full twenty-four hours before Tom felt like stirring from his cot to take up
the shipboard routine.
And then there  was  nothing for him to  do.  Greg  handled  the navigation skilfully, while  Johnny  kept
radio contact and busied himself in the storeroom, so Tom spent hours at the viewscreen. On the second
day he spotted a tiny chunk of rock that was unquestionably an asteroid moving swiftly toward them. It
passed at a tangent ten thousand miles ahead of them, and Greg started work at the computer, feeding in
the data tapes that would ultimately guide the ship to its goal.
* * * * *
Pinpointing a given spot in the Asteroid Belt was a gargantuan task, virtually impossible without the aid
of the ship's computer to compute orbits, speeds, and distances. Tom spent more and more time at the
viewscreen, searching the blackness of space for more asteroid sightings. But except  for an occasional
tiny bit of debris hurtling by, he saw nothing but the changeless panorama of stars.
Johnny  Coombs  found  him  there  on  the  third  day,  and  laughed  at  his  sour  expression.  "Gettin'
impatient?"
"Just wondering when we'll reach the Belt, is all," Tom said.
Johnny chuckled.  "Hope  you're  not holdin' your breath.  We've  already  been  in the Belt for the last
forty-eight hours."
"Then where are all the asteroids?" Tom said.
"Oh, they're here. You just won't see many of them. People always think there ought to be dozens of
them around, like sheep on a hillside, but it just doesn't work that way." Johnny peered at the screen. "Of
course, to an astronomer the Belt is just loaded ... hundreds of thousands of chunks, all sizes from five
hundred miles in diameter on down. But actually, those chunks are all tens of thousands  of miles apart,
and the Belt looks just as empty as the space between Mars and Earth."
"Well, I don't see how we're ever going to  find one  particular  rock,"  Tom said,  watching the screen
gloomily.
"It's not too hard. Every asteroid has its own orbit around the sun, and everyone that's been registered
as a claim has the orbit charted. The one we want isn't where it was when your Dad's body was found ...
it's been travelling in its orbit ever since. But by figuring in the fourth dimension, we can locate it."

Tom blinked. "Fourth dimension?"
"Time," Johnny Coombs said. "If we just used the three linear dimensions ... length, width and depth ...
we'd  end  up at  the place  where  the asteroid  was, but  that  wouldn't  help  us  much  because  it's  been
moving in orbit ever since the Patrol Ship last pinpointed it. So we figure in a fourth dimension ... the time
that's passed since it was last spotted ... and we can chart a collision course with it, figure out just where
we'll have to be to meet it."
It was the first time that the idea of time as a "dimension" had ever made sense  to  Tom. They talked
some more, until Johnny started bringing in fifth and  sixth dimensions, and  problems  of irrational space
and hyperspace, and got even himself confused.
"Anyway," Tom said, "I'm glad we've got a computer aboard."
"And a navigator," Johnny added. "Don't sell your brother short."
"Fat chance of that. Greg would never stand for it."
Johnny frowned. "You lads don't like each other very much, do you?" he said.
Tom was silent for a moment. Then he looked away. "We get along, I guess."
"Maybe.  But  sometimes  just  gettin'  along  isn't  enough.  Especially  when  there's  trouble.  Give  it  a
thought, when you've got a minute or two...."
Later, the three of them went over the computer results together. Johnny and Greg fed the navigation
data into the ship's drive mechanism, checking and rechecking speeds and inclination angles. Already the
Dutchman's orbital speed was matching the speed of Roger Hunter's asteroid ... but the orbit had to be
tracked so that they would arrive at the exact point in space to make contact. Tom was assigned to the
viewscreen, and the long wait began.
He spotted their destination point an hour before the computer had predicted contact ... at first a tiny
pinpoint of reflected light in the scope, gradually resolving into two pinpoints, then three in a tiny cluster.
Greg cut in the rear and lateral jets momentarily, stabilizing their contact course; the dots grew larger.
Ten minutes later, Tom could see their goal clearly in the viewscreen ... the place where Roger Hunter
had died.
* * * * *
It was neither large nor small for an asteroid, an irregular chunk of rock and metal, perhaps five miles in
diameter, lighted only by the dull reddish glow from the dime-sized sun. Like many such jagged chunks of
debris that sprinkled the Belt, this asteroid did not spin on any axis, but constantly presented  the same
face to the sun.
Just off the bright side  the orbit-ship  floated,  stable  in its orbit  next to  the big rock,  but so  small in
comparison that it looked like a tiny glittering toy balloon. And clamped  on its rack  on the orbit-ship's
side, airlock to airlock, was the Scavenger, the little scout ship that Roger Hunter had brought out from
Mars on his last journey.
While Greg maneuvered the Dutchman into the empty landing rack below the Scavenger on the hull of
the orbit-ship, Johnny scanned the blackness around them through the viewscope, a frown wrinkling his
forehead.
"Do you see anybody?" Tom asked.
"Not a sign ... but I'm really looking for other rocks. I can see three that aren't too far away, but none
of them have claim marks. This one must have been the only one Roger was working."
They stared at the ragged surface of the planetoid. Raw veins of metallic ore cut through it with streaks
of color,  but most of the sun-side  showed  only the dull  gray  of  iron  and  granite.  There  was  nothing
unusual about the surface that Tom could see. "Could there be anything on the dark side?"
"Could be," Johnny said. "We'll have to go over it foot by foot ... but first, we should go through the
orbit-ship and the Scavenger. If the Patrol ship missed anything, we want to know it."

The interior of the orbit-ship was dark. It spun slowly on its axis, giving them just enough weight so
they would not float free whenever they moved. Their boots clanged on the metal decks as they climbed
up the curving corridor toward the control cabin.
Then Johnny threw a light switch, and they stared around them in amazement.
The cabin was a shambles. Everything that  was  not bolted  down  had  been  ripped  open  and  thrown
aside.
Greg whistled through his teeth. "The Major said the Patrol crew had gone through the ship ... but he
didn't say they'd wrecked it."
"They didn't," Johnny said grimly. "No Patrol ship would ever do this. Somebody  else  has  been  here
since." He  turned  to  the control  panel,  flipped  switches,  checked  gauges.  "Hydroponics  are  all  right.
Atmosphere is still good; we can take off these helmets. Fuel looks all right, storage holds ..." He shook
his head. "They weren't looting, but they were looking for something, all right. Let's look around and see
if they missed anything."
It  took  them  an  hour  to  survey  the  wreckage.  Not  a  compartment  had  been  missed.  Even  the
mattresses on the accelleration cots had been torn open, the spring-stuffing tossed  about  helter-skelter.
Tom went  through  the  lock  into  the  Scavenger;  the  scout  ship  too  had  been  searched,  rapidly  but
thoroughly.
But there was no sign of anything that Roger Hunter might have found.
Back in the control cabin Johnny was checking the ship's log. The old entries were on microfilm, stored
on their spools near the reader. More recent entries were still recorded on tape. From the jumbled order,
there was no doubt that marauders had examined them. Johnny ran through them nevertheless, but there
was nothing of interest. Routine navigational data; a record of the time of contact with the asteroid; a log
of preliminary observations on the rock; nothing more.  The last tape  recorded  the call-schedule  Roger
Hunter had set up with the Patrol, a routine precaution used by all miners, to bring help if for some reason
they should fail to check in on schedule.
There was no hint in the log of any extraordinary discovery.
"Are any tapes missing?" Greg wanted to know.
"Doesn't look like it. There's one here for each day-period."
"I wonder," Tom said. "Dad always kept a personal log. You know, a sort of a  diary,  on microfilm."
He peered into the film storage bin, checked through the spools. Then, from down beneath the last row
of spools he pulled out a slightly smaller spool. "Here's something our friends missed, I bet."
It was not really a diary, just a sequence of notes, calculations and ideas that Roger Hunter had jotted
down and microfilmed from time to time. The entries on the one spool went back for several years. Tom
fed the spool into the reader, and they stared eagerly at the last few entries.
A series  of calculations, covering several  pages,  but with no notes  to  indicate what,  exactly,  Roger
Hunter had been calculating. "Looks like he was plotting an orbit," Greg said. "But what orbit? And why?
Nothing here to tell."
"It must have been important, though, or  Dad  wouldn't  have filmed the pages,"  Tom said.  "Anything
else?"
Another sheet with more calculations. Then a short paragraph written in Roger Hunter's hurried scrawl.
"No doubt now what it is," the words said. "Wish Johnny were here, show him a real bonanza, but he'll
know soon enough if...."
They stared at the scribbled, uncompleted sentence. Then Johnny Coombs let out a whoop. "I told you
he found something! And he found it here, not somewhere else."
"Hold it," Greg said, peering at the film reader. "There's something more on the last page,  but I can't
read it."
Tom blinked at  the entry.  "'Inter  Jovem et  Martem  planetam interposui,'" he read.  He  scratched  his

head. "That's Latin, and it's famous, too.  Kepler  wrote  it, back  before  the asteroids  were  discovered.
'Between Jupiter and Mars I will put a planet.'"
Greg and Johnny looked at each other. "I don't get it," Greg said.
"Dad told me about that once," Tom said. "Kepler couldn't  understand  the long jump between  Mars
and Jupiter, when Venus and Earth and  Mars  were  so  close  together.  He  figured there  ought to  be  a
planet out here ... and he was  right, in a  way.  There  wasn't  any one  planet,  unless you'd  call Ceres  a
planet, but it wasn't just empty space between Mars and Jupiter either. The asteroids were here."
"But why would Dad be  writing that down?"  Greg  asked.  "And what has  it got to  do  with what he
found out here?" He snapped off the reader switch angrily. "I don't understand any of this, and I don't like
it. If Dad found something out here, where is it? And who tore this ship apart after the Patrol ship left?"
"Probably the same ones that caused the 'accident' in the first place," Johnny said.
"But why did they come back?" Greg protested. "If they killed Dad, they must have known what he'd
found before they killed him."
"You'd think so," Johnny conceded.
"Then why take the risk of coming back here again?"
"Maybe they didn't know," Tom said thoughtfully.
"What do you mean?"
"I mean maybe they killed him too soon. Maybe they thought they knew what he'd found and where it
was ... and then found out that they didn't, after all. Maybe Dad hid it...."
Johnny Coombs shook his head. "No way a man can hide an ore strike."
"But suppose Dad did, somehow, and whoever killed him couldn't find it? It would be too late to make
him tell them. They'd have to come back and look again, wouldn't they? And from the way they went
about it, it looks as though they weren't having much luck."
"Then whatever Dad found would still be here, somewhere," Greg said.
"That's right."
"But where? There's nothing on this ship."
"Maybe not," Tom said, "but I'd like to take a look at that asteroid before we give up."
* * * * *
They paused in the big ore-loading lock to reclamp their pressure suit helmets, and looked down at the
jagged chunk of rock  a  hundred  yards  below  them. In the lock  they  had  found  scooters  ...  the  little
one-man propulsion units so commonly used for short distance work in space ... but decided not to use
them. "They're clumsy," Johnny said,  "and the bumper  units in your  suits  will  do  just  as  well  for  this
distance." He looked down at the rock. "I'll take the center section. You each take an edge and work in.
Look for any signs of work on the surface ... chisel marks, Murexide charges, anything."
"What about the dark side?" Greg asked.
"If we want to see anything there, we'll either have to rig up lights or turn the rock around," Johnny said.
"Let's cover this side first and see what we come up with."
He turned and leaped from the airlock, moving gracefully down toward the surface, using the bumper
unit to guide himself with short bursts of compressed CO{2}, from the nozzle. Greg followed, pushing
off  harder  and  passing  Johnny  halfway  down.  Tom  hesitated.  It  looked  easy  enough  ...  but  he
remembered the violent nausea of his first few hours of free fall.
Finally he gritted his teeth and jumped off after Greg. Instantly he knew that he had jumped too
hard. He shot away from the orbit-ship like a bullet; the jagged asteroid surface leaped up at him.
Frantically he grabbed for the bumper nozzle and pulled the trigger, trying to break his fall.
He felt the  nozzle  jerk  in  his  hand,  and  then,  abruptly,  he  was  spinning  off  at  a  wild  tangent
from the  asteroid,  head  over  heels.  For  a  moment  it  seemed  that  asteroid,  orbit-ship  and  stars

were all wheeling crazily around him. Then he realized what had happened. He fired the bumper
again,  and  went  spinning  twice  as  fast.  The  third  time  he  timed  the  blast,  aiming  the  nozzle
carefully, and the spinning almost stopped.
He fought down nausea, trying to  get  his  bearings.  He  was  three  hundred  yards  out  from  the
asteroid, almost twice as far from the orbit-ship. He stared down at the rock as he moved slowly
away from it. Before, from the orbit-ship, he had been able to see only the bright side of the huge
rock; now he could see the sharp line of darkness across one side.
But there was something else....
He fired the bumper again to steady himself, peering into the blackness beyond the light-line on
the  rock.  He  snapped  on  his  helmet  lamp,  aimed  the  spotlight  beam  down  to  the  dark  rock
surface. Greg and Johnny were landing now on the bright side, with Greg almost out of sight over
the  "horizon"  ...  but  Tom's  attention  was  focussed  on  something  he  could  see  only  now  as  he
moved away from the asteroid surface.
His spotlight  caught  it  ...  something  bright  and  metallic,  completely  hidden  on  the  dark  side,
lying in close to the surface but not quite on the surface. Then suddenly Tom knew what it was ...
the braking jets of a Class I Ranger, crouching beyond the reach of sunlight in the shadow of the
asteroid....
Swiftly  he  fired  the  bumper  again,  turning  back  toward  the  orbit-ship.  His  hand  went  to  the
speaker-switch, but he caught himself in time.  Any  warning  shouted  to  Greg  and  Johnny  would
certainly be picked up by the ship. But he had to give warning somehow.
He tumbled into the airlock, searching for a flare in his web belt. It was a risk ... the Ranger ship
might pick up the flash ... but he had to take it. He  was  unscrewing  the  fuse  cap  from  the  flare
when he saw Greg and Johnny leap up from the asteroid surface.
Then he saw what had alarmed them. Slowly, the Ranger was moving out from its hiding place
behind the rock. Tom reached out to catch Greg as he came plummeting into the lock. There was
a flash from the Ranger's side, and Johnny Coombs' voice boomed in his earphones: "Get inside!
Get the lock closed, fast ... hurry up, can't waste a second."
Johnny  caught  the  lip  of  the  lock,  dragged  himself  inside  frantically.  They  were  spinning  the
airlock door closed when they heard the thundering explosion, felt the ship lurch under their feet,
and all three of them went crashing to the deck.
5. The Black Raider
For a stunned moment they were helpless  as  they  struggled  to  pick  themselves  up.  The  stable
airlock deck was suddenly no longer stable ... it was lurching back and forth like a rowboat on a
heavy  sea,  and  they  grabbed  the  shock-bars  along  the  bulkheads  to  steady  themselves.  "What
happened?" Greg yelped. "I saw a ship...."
As if in answer there was another crash belowdecks, and the lurching became  worse.  "They're
firing on us, that's what happened," Johnny Coombs growled.
"Well,  they're  shaking  us  loose  at  the  seams,"  Greg  said.  "We've  got  to  get  this  crate  out  of
here." He reached for his helmet, began unsnapping his pressure suit.
"Leave it on," Johnny snapped.
"But we can't move fast enough in these things...."
"Leave it on  all  the  same.  If  they  split  the  hull  open,  you'll  be  dead  in  ten  seconds  without  a
suit."
Somewhere  below  they  heard  the  steady  clang-clang-clang  of  the  emergency-station's  bell  ...
already one of the compartments somewhere had been breached, and was pouring its air out into
the vacuum of space. "But what can we do?" Greg said. "They could tear us apart!"
"First, we see what they've already done," Johnny said, spinning the wheel on the inner lock. "If

they plan to tear us apart, we're done for, but they may want to try to board us.... We'll wait and
see."
An orbit-ship under fire was completely vulnerable. One well-placed shell could rip it open like a
balloon.
Tom and Greg followed Johnny to where the control cabin was  located.  In  control  they  found
alarm  lights  flashing  in  three  places  on  the  instrument  panel.  Another  muffled  crash  roared
through the ship, and a new row of lights sprang on along the panel.
"How are the engines?" Greg said, staring at the flickering lights.
"Can't  tell.  Looks  like  they're  firing  at  the  main  jets,  but  they've  ripped  open  three  storage
holds, too. They're trying to disable us...."
"What about the Scavenger?"
Johnny checked a gauge. "The airlock compartment is all right, so the scout ships haven't been
touched. They  couldn't  fire  on  them  without  splitting  the  whole  ship  down  the  middle."  Johnny
leaned forward, flipped on the viewscreen, and an image came into focus.
* * * * *
It  was  a  Class  I  Ranger,  and  there  was  no  doubt  of  its  origin.  Like  the  one  they  had  seen
berthing  at  the  Sun  Lake  City  racks,  this  ship  had  a  glossy  black  hull,  with  the  golden
triangle-and-J insignia standing out in sharp relief in the dim sunlight.
"It's our friends, all right," Johnny said.
"But what are they trying to do?" Tom said.
Even  as  they  watched,  a  pair  of  scooters  broke  from  the  side  of  the  Ranger  and  slid  down
toward the sun side of the asteroid. "I don't  know,"  Johnny  said.  "I  think  they  intended  to  stay
hidden, until Tom lost control of his bumper, and got far enough around there to spot them." He
frowned as the first scooter touched down on the asteroid surface.
"Can't we fire on them?" Greg said angrily.
"Not the way this tub is lurching around. They've got our main gyros, and the auxilliaries aren't
powerful enough to steady us. Another blast or two could  send  us  spinning  like  a  top,  and  we'd
have nothing to stabilize us...."
There  was  another  flash  from  the  Ranger's  hull,  and  the  ship  jerked  under  their  feet.  "Well,
we're  a  sitting  duck  here,"  Greg  said.  "Maybe  those  engines  will  still  work."  He  slid  into  the
control seat, flipped the drive switches to fire the side jets in opposite pairs. They fired, steadying
the lurching of the ship somewhat, but there was no response from the main engines. "No  good.
We couldn't begin to run from them. We're stuck here."
"They could  outrun  us  anyway,"  Tom  said,  watching  the  viewscreen.  "And  they're  moving  in
closer now."
"They're going to board us," Tom said.
Johnny nodded, his eyes suddenly bright. "I think you're right. And  if  they  do,  we  may  have  a
chance. But we've got to split up.... Greg, you take the control cabin here, try to keep them out if
you  can.  Tom  can  cover  the  main  corridor  to  the  storage  holds,  and  I'll  take  the  engine  room
section. That will sew up the entrances to control, here, and give us a chance to stop them."
"They may have a dozen men," Tom said. "They could just shoot us down."
"I don't think so," Johnny said. "They want us, not the ship, or they wouldn't bother to board us.
We may not be able to hold them off, but we can try."
"What about making a run for it in the Scavenger?" Greg said.
Johnny chuckled grimly. "It'd be a mighty short run. That Ranger's got homing shells that could
blow the Scavenger to splinters if we tried it. Our best bet is to put up such a brawl that they think

twice about taking us."
They  parted  in  the  corridor  outside  control,  Johnny  heading  down  for  the  engine  room
corridors,  while  Tom  ran  up  toward  the  main  outer-shell  corridor,  a  Markheim  stunner  in  his
hand. The entire outer shell of the ship  was  storage  space,  each  compartment  separately  sealed
and  connected  with  the  two  main  corridors  that  circled  the  ship.  On  each  side  these  corridors
came together to join the short entry corridors from the scout-ship airlocks.
Tom  knew  that  the  only  way  the  ship  could  be  boarded  was  through  those  locks;  a  man
stationed at the place where the main corridors joined could block any entry from the locks ... as
long as he could hold his position. Tom reached the junction of the corridors, and crouched close
to the wall. By peering around the corner, he had a good view of the airlock corridor.
Tom gripped the Markheim tightly, and he dialed it down to a narrow beam. Nobody had ever
been killed by a stunner ... but a direct hit  with  a  narrow  beam  could  paralyze  a  man  for  three
days.
There was movement at the far end of the airlock corridor. A helmeted head peered around the
turn in the corridor; then two men in pressure suits moved into view, walking cautiously, weapons
in hand. Tom shrank back against the wall, certain they had not  seen  him.  He  waited  until  they
were almost to the junction with the main corridor; then he took aim and pressed the trigger stud
on his Markheim. There was an ugly ripping sound as the  gun  jerked  in  his  hand.  The  two  men
dropped as though they had been pole-axed.
A shout, a scrape of metal  against  metal,  and  a  shot  ripped  back  at  him  from  the  end  of  the
corridor. Tom jerked back fast, but not quite fast enough. He  felt  a  sledge-hammer  blow  on  his
shoulder,  felt  his  arm  jerk  in  a  cramping  spasm  while  the  corridor  echoed  the  low  rumble  of
sub-sonics.  He  flexed  his  arm  to  work  out  the  spasm  ...  they  were  using  a  wide  beam,  hardly
strong enough to stun a man. His heart pounded. They were being careful, very careful....
Two more men rounded the bend in the corridor. Tom fired, but they hit the deck fast, and the
beam missed. The first one jerked to his feet, charged up the  corridor  toward  him,  dodging  and
sliding. Tom followed him in his sights, fired three times as the Markheim heated up in his hand.
The beam hit the man's leg, dumping him to the deck, and bounced off to catch the second one.
But  now  there  was  another  sound,  coming  from  the  corridor  behind  him.  Voices,  shouts,
clanging of boots. He pressed against the wall, listening. The sounds were from below. They must
have gotten past Johnny ... probably the  men  on  the  scooters.  Tom  looked  around  helplessly.  If
they came up behind him, he was trapped in a crossfire. But if he left his position, more men could
come in through the airlock. Even now two more came around the bend, starting up the corridor
for him....
Quite suddenly, the lights went out.
The  men  stopped.  Sound  stopped.  The  corridor  was  pitch  black.  Tom  fired  wildly  down  the
corridor, heard shouts and oaths from the men, but he could see nothing. Then, ahead, a flicker of
light as a headlamp went on. The men from the airlock were close, moving in on  him,  and  from
behind he saw light bouncing off the corridor walls....
He jerked open the hatch to a storage hold, ducked inside, and slammed the hatch behind him.
He pressed against the wall, panting.
He waited.
Suddenly an idea flickered in Tom's mind.
It was a chance ... a long chance ... but it was something. If they were going to be captured in
spite of anything they could do, even a long chance would be worth trying....
He waited in the  darkness,  tried  to  think  it  through.  It  was  a  wild  idea,  an  utterly  impossible
idea,  he  had  never  heard  of  it  being  tried  before  ...  but  any  chance  was  better  than  none.  He

remembered  what  Johnny  had  said  in  the  control  cabin.  The  Ranger  ship  would  have  homing
shells. An attempt to make a run with the Scavenger might be disastrous.
He thought about it, trying to reason it out. The Jupiter Equilateral men obviously wanted them
alive. They did not dare to kill Roger Hunter's sons, because Roger Hunter might have told them
where the bonanza was. And Jupiter Equilateral would not dare let anyone of them break away. If
one of them got back to Mars, the whole U.N. Patrol would be out in the Belt....
The plan became clear in his mind, but he had to let Greg know. He fingered the control of his
helmet radio. The boarding party would have a snooper, but if he was quick, they wouldn't have
time to nail him. He buzzed an attention code. "Greg? Can you hear me?"
Silence. He buzzed again, and waited.  What  was  wrong?  Had  they  already  broken  through  to
the control cabin and taken Greg? He buzzed again. "Greg! Sound off if you can hear me."
More silence. Then a click. "Tom?"
"Here. Are you all right?"
"So far. You?"
"They got past me, but they didn't hit me. How's Johnny?"
"I  don't  know,"  Greg  said.  "I  think  he's  been  hurt.  Tom,  you'd  better  get  off,  they'll  have
snoopers...."
"All right, listen," Tom said. "How does it look to you?"
"Bad. We're outnumbered, they'll be through to here any minute."
"All right, I've got an idea. It's risky, but it might let us pull something out of this mess. I'll need
some time, though."
"How much?"
"Ten, fifteen minutes."
There was an edge to Greg's voice. "What are you planning?"
"I can't tell you, they're listening in. But if it works...."
"Look, don't do anything stupid."
"I can't hear you," Tom said. "You try to hold them for fifteen minutes ... and don't worry. Take
care of yourself."
Tom snapped off the speaker and moved to the  hatchway.  The  corridor  was  empty,  and  pitch
black.  He  started  down  toward  the  airlock,  then  stopped  short  at  the  sound  of  voices  and  the
flicker of headlamps up ahead.
He crouched  back,  but  the  lights  were  not  moving.  Guards  at  the  lock,  making  certain  that
nobody tried to board their own ship. Tom grinned to himself. They weren't missing any bets,  he
thought.
Except one. There was one bet they wouldn't even think of.
He  backtracked  to  the  storage  hold,  crossed  through  it,  and  out  into  the  far  corridor.  He
followed the gentle curve of the deck a quarter of the way around the ship. Twice along the way
he stumbled in the darkness, but saw no sign of the raiders. At last he reached  the  far  side,  and
the corridor leading to No. 2 airlock. Again he could see the lamps of the guards around the bend;
they were stationed directly inside their own lock.
Inching forward, he peered into blackness. Each step made a muffled clang on the deck plates.
He edged his boots along as quietly as possible, reaching along the wall with his hand until he felt
the lip of a hatchway.
The lights and voices seemed nearer now. In the dim reflected light he saw the sign on the door
of the hatchway:

No. 2 Airlock BE SURE PRESSURE GAUGE IS AT ZERO BEFORE OPENING HATCH
He checked the gauge, silently spun the wheel. There was a ping as the seals broke. He pulled the
hatch open just enough to squeeze into the lock, then closed it behind him. Then  he  switched  on
the  pumps,  waiting  impatiently  until  the  red  "all  clear"  signal  flashed  on.  Then  he  opened  the
outside lock.
Just beyond, he could see the sleek silvery lines of the Scavenger.
It was their only chance.
He took a deep breath, and jumped across the gap to the open lock of the Scavenger.
6. The Last Run of the Scavenger
To Greg Hunter  the  siege  of  the  orbit-ship  had  been  a  nerve-wracking  game  of  listening  and
waiting for something to happen.
In the darkness of the control cabin he stretched his fingers, cramped from gripping the  heavy
Markheim stunner, and checked the corridor outside again. There was no sound  in  the  darkness
there,  no  sign  of  movement.  Somewhere  far  below  he  heard  metal  banging  on  metal;  minutes
before he thought he had heard the sharp ripping sound of a stunner blast overhead, but he wasn't
sure. Wherever the fighting was going on, it was not here.
He shook his head as his uneasiness mounted. Why hadn't Johnny come back? He'd gone off to
try  and  disable  the  Ranger  ship  leaving  Greg  to  guard  the  control  cabin.  Why  no  sign  of  the
marauders in the control cabin corridor? This should have been  the  first  place  they  would  head
for, if they planned to take the ship, but there had been nothing but silence and darkness. Johnny
had been gone near 15 minutes already. Greg became more uneasy.
He waited. Suddenly, bitterly, he realized the hopelessness of it. Even if Johnny  did  manage  to
damage the Ranger ship, what difference would it make? They had been fools to come out  here,
idiots to ignore Tawney's  warning,  the  three  of  them.  Tawney  had  told  them  in  so  many  words
that there would be trouble, and they had come out anyway, just begging for it.
Well, now they had what they'd begged for. Greg slammed his fist into  his  palm  angrily.  What
had  they  expected?  That  the  big  company  would  step  humbly  aside  for  them,  with  a  fortune
hanging in the balance? If they had even begun to think it through before they started....
But they hadn't, and now it was too late.  They  were  under  attack;  Johnny  was  off  on  a  fool's
errand, gone too long for comfort, and Tom ... Greg glanced at his watch. It had been ten minutes
since Tom's call. What had he meant by it? A plan, he said. A long chance.
He  couldn't  shake  off  the  cold  feeling  in  his  chest  when  he  thought  about  Tom.  What  if
something happened to him....
Greg remembered how he had grown to resent his brother. The time when they were very young
and Tom had been struck by the sickness, a native Martian virus  they  called  it.  He  remembered
the endless nights of attention given to Tom alone. From  then  on  somehow  they  weren't  friends
any more. But now all that seemed  to  disappear  and  Greg  only  wished  that  Tom  would  appear
down the corridor....
A sound startled him. He tensed, gripping the stunner, peering into the darkness. Had he heard
something? Or was it his own foot scraping on the deck plate? He held his breath, listening, and
the sound came again, louder.
Someone was moving stealthily up the corridor.
Greg waited, covered by the edge of the hatchway. It might be Johnny returning, or maybe even
Tom ... but there was no sign of recognition. Whoever it was was coming silently....
Then  a  beam  of  light  flared  from  a  headlamp,  and  he  saw  the  blue  crackle  of  a  stunner.  He
jerked back as the beam bounced off the metal  walls.  Then  he  was  firing  point  blank  down  the
corridor,  his  stunner  on  a  tight  beam,  a  deadly  pencil  of  violent  energy.  He  heard  a  muffled

scream and a bulk loomed up in front of him, crashed to the deck at his feet.
He fired again. Another crash, a shout, and then the sound of  footsteps  retreating.  He  waited,
his heart pounding, but there was nothing more.
The first attempt on the control cabin had failed.
* * * * *
Five minutes later the second attempt began. This time there was no warning sound. A sudden,
ear-splitting  crash,  a  groan  of  tortured  metal,  and  the  barricaded  hatchway  glowed  dull  red.
Another crash followed. The edge of the hatch split open, pouring acrid Murexide fumes into the
cabin. A third explosion breached the door six inches; Greg could see headlamps in the  corridor
beyond.
He fired through the crack, pressing down the stud until the stunner scorched his hand. Then he
heard  boots  clanging  up  the  other  corridor.  He  pressed  back  against  the  wall,  waited  until  the
sounds were near, then threw open the  hatch.  For  an  instant  he  made  a  perfect  target,  but  the
raiders did not fire. The stunner buzzed in his hand, and once again the footfalls retreated.
They were being careful!
Silence then, and blackness. Minutes passed ... five, ten.... Greg checked the time again. It was
over  twenty  minutes  since  Tom  had  talked  to  him.  What  had  happened?  Whatever  Tom  had
planned  must  have  misfired,  or  something  would  have  happened  by  now.  For  a  moment  he
considered leaving his post and starting down the dark corridor to search ... but where to search?
There was nothing to do but wait and hope for a miracle.
Then suddenly the lights blazed on in the  control  cabin  and  the  corridor  outside.  An  attention
signal buzzed in Greg's earphones. "All right, Hunter, it's  all  over,"  a  voice  grated.  "You've  got
five minutes to get down to No. 3 lock. If you make us come get you, you'll get hurt."
"I'll chance it," Greg snapped back. "Come on up."
"We're through fooling," the voice said. "You'd  better  get  down  here.  And  bring  your  brother
with you."
"Sure," Greg said. "Start holding your breath."
The contact broke for a moment, then clicked on again. This time it was another voice. "We've
got Johnny Coombs down here," it said. "You want him to stay alive, you start moving. Without
your stunner."
Greg chewed his lip. They could be bluffing ... but they might not be. "I want to see Johnny," he
said.
On the control panel a viewscreen  flickered  to  life.  "Take  a  look,  then,"  the  voice  said  in  his
earphones.
They had Johnny, all right. A burly guard was holding his good arm behind his back. Greg could
see the speaker wires jerked loose from his helmet.
"It's up to you," the voice said. "You've got three minutes. If you're not down here by then, this
helmet comes off and your friend goes out the lock. It's quick that way, but it's not very pleasant."
Johnny  was  shaking  his  head  violently;  the  guard  wrenched  at  his  arm,  and  the  miner's  face
twisted in pain. "Two minutes," the voice said.
"Okay," Greg said. "I'm coming down."
"Drop the stunner right there."
He dropped the weapon onto the deck. Three steps out into the corridor, and two guards were
there to meet him, stunners raised. They marched him up the ramp to the outer level corridor and
around to No. 3 lock.
They were waiting there with Johnny. A moment later the guards herded them through the lock

and into the hold of the Ranger ship, stripped off their suits, and searched them.
A big man with a heavy face and coarse black hair came into the  cabin.  He  looked  at  Johnny
and Greg and grunted. "You must be Hunter," he said to Greg. "Where's the other one?"
"What other one?" Greg said.
"Your brother. Where is he?"
"How would I know?" Greg said.
The  man's  face  darkened.  "You'd  be  smart  to  watch  your  tongue,"  he  said.  "We  know  there
were three of you, we want the other one."
The man turned to a guard. "What about it?"
"Don't know, Doc. Nobody's reported him."
"Then take a crew and search the ship. We were due back hours ago. He's in there somewhere."
"Sure, Doc." The guard disappeared through the lock. The man called Doc motioned Greg and
Johnny through into the main cabin.
"What are you planning to do with us?" Greg demanded.
"You'll find out soon enough." Doc's mouth twisted angrily.
A guard burst into the cabin. "Doc, there's just nobody there! We've scoured the ship."
"You think he just floated away in his space suit?" Doc growled. "Find him. Tawney only needs
one of them, but we can't take a chance on the other one getting back...." He broke off, his eyes
on the viewscreen. "Did you check those scout ships?"
"No, I thought...."
"Get down there and check them." Doc turned back to the viewscreen impatiently.
Greg caught Johnny's eye, saw the big miner's worried frown. "Where is he?" he whispered.
"I don't know. Thought you did...."
"All I know is that he had some kind of scheme in mind."
"Shut up," Doc said to them. "If you're smart, you'll be strapping down before we...." He broke
off in mid sentence, listening.
Quite  suddenly,  the  Ranger  ship  had  begun  to  vibrate.  Somewhere,  far  away,  there  was  the
muffled rumble of engines.
Doc  whirled  to  the  viewscreen.  Greg  and  Johnny  looked  at  the  same  instant,  and  Johnny
groaned.
Below them, the Scavenger's jets were flaring. First the pale starter flame, then a long stream of
fire, growing longer as the engines developed thrust.
Doc slammed down a switch, roared into a speaker. "That scout ship ...  stop  it!  He's  trying  to
make a break!"
Two guards appeared at the lock almost instantly, but it was too late. Already she was straining
at  her  magnetic  cable  moorings;  then  the  exhaust  flared,  and  the  little  scout  ship  leaped  away
from  the  orbit-ship,  moving  out  at  a  tangent  to  the  asteroid's  orbit,  picking  up  speed,  moving
faster and faster....
In toward the orbit of Mars.
The man called Doc had gone pale. Now he snapped on the speaker again. "Frank? Stand by on
missile control. He's asking for it."
"Right," the voice came back. "I'm sighting in."
The Scavenger was moving fast now, dwindling in the viewscreen. One panel of the screen went
telescopic to track her. "All right," Doc said. "Fire one and two."

From both sides of the Ranger, tiny rockets  flared.  Like  twin  bullets  the  homing  shells  moved
out,  side  by  side,  in  the  track  of  the  escaping  Scavenger.  With  a  strangled  cry,  Greg  leaped
forward, but Johnny caught his arm.
"Johnny, Tom's on ... that thing...."
"I know. But he's got a chance."
Already  the  homing  shells  were  out  of  sight;  only  the  twin  flares  were  visible.  Greg  stared
helplessly at the tiny light-spot of the Scavenger. At first she  had  been  moving  straight,  but  now
she was dodging and twisting, her side-jets flaring at irregular  intervals.  The  twin  pursuit  shells
mimicked each change in course, drawing closer to her every second.
And then there was a flash, so brilliant it nearly blinded them, and the Scavenger burst apart in
space. The second shell struck a fragment; there was another flash. Then there was nothing but a
nebulous powdering of tiny metal fragments.
The last run of the Scavenger had ended.
Dazed,  Greg  turned  away  from  the  screen,  and  somewhere,  as  if  in  a  dream,  he  heard  Doc
saying, "All right, boys, strap this pair down. We've got a lot of work to do before we can get out
of here."
7. Prisoners
Wherever they were planning to take them, the captors took great pains to make sure that their
two prisoners did not escape before they were underway. Greg and Johnny  were  strapped  down
securely into accelleration  cots.  Two  burly  guards  were  assigned  to  them,  and  the  guards  were
taking their job seriously. One of the two was watching them at all times, and both men held their
stunners on ready.
Meanwhile,  under  Doc's  orders,  the  crew  of  the  Jupiter  Equilateral  ship  began  a  systematic
looting  of  the  orbit-ship  they  had  disabled.  Earlier  they  had  merely  searched  the  cabins  and
compartments. Now a steady stream of pressure-suited men crossed through the airlocks into the
crippled vessel,  marched  back  with  packing  cases  full  of  tape  records,  microfilm  spools,  stored
computer  data  ...  anything  that  might  conceivably  contain  information.  The  control  cabin  was
literally torn apart. Every storage hold was ransacked.
A team of six men was dispatched to the asteroid surface, searching for any sign  of  mining  or
prospecting activity. They came back an hour later, long-faced and empty handed. Doc took their
reports, his scowl growing deeper and deeper.
Finally the last of  the  searchers  reported  in.  "Doc,  we'd  scraped  it  clean,  and  there's  nothing
there. Not one thing that we didn't check before."
"There's got to be something there," Doc said.
"You tell me where else to look, and I'll do it."
Doc shook his head ominously. "Tawney's not going to like it," he said. "There's no other place
it could be...."
"Well, at least we have this pair," the other said, jerking a thumb at Greg and Johnny. "They'll
know."
Doc looked at them darkly. "Yes, and they'll tell, too, or I don't know Tawney."
Greg watched it all happening, heard the noises, saw the packing-cases come through the cabin,
and still he could not quite believe it. He  caught  Johnny's  eye,  then  turned  away,  suddenly  sick.
Johnny shook his head. "Take it easy, boy."
"He didn't even have a chance," Greg said.
"I know that. He must have known it too."
"But why? What was he thinking of?"

"Maybe he thought he could make it. Maybe he thought it was the only chance...."
There was no other answer that Greg could see, and the ache in his chest was deeper.
There was no way to bring Tom back now. However things had been between them, they could
never be changed now. But he knew that  as  long  as  he  was  still  breathing,  somebody  somehow
was going to answer for that last desperate run of the Scavenger....
* * * * *
It  had  been  an  excellent  idea,  Tom  Hunter  thought  to  himself,  and  it  had  worked  perfectly,
exactly as he had planned it ... so far. But now, as he clung to his precarious perch, he wondered if
it had not worked out a little too well. The first flush of excitement that he had felt when he saw
the Scavenger blow apart in space had begun to die down now; on its heels came the unpleasant
truth, the realization that only the easy part lay behind him so far. The hard part was yet to come,
and if that were to fail....
He  realized,  suddenly,  that  he  was  afraid.  He  was  well  enough  concealed  at  the  moment,
clinging tightly against the outside hull of the Ranger ship, hidden behind the open  airlock  door.
But soon the airlock would be pulled closed, and then the real test would come.
Carefully, he ran through the plan again in his mind. He was certain now that his reasoning was
right. There had been two dozen men on the raider ship; there had been  no  question,  even  from
the start, that they would succeed in boarding the orbit-ship  and  taking  its  occupants  prisoners.
The Jupiter Equilateral ship had not appeared there by  coincidence.  They  had  come  looking  for
something that they had not found.
And the  only  source  of  information  left  was  Roger  Hunter's  sons.  The  three  of  them  together
might have held the ship for hours, or even days  ...  but  with  engines  and  radios  smashed,  there
had been no hope of contacting Mars for help. Ultimately, they would have been taken.
As he had crouched in the  dark  storage  hold  in  the  orbit-ship,  Tom  had  realized  this.  He  had
also  realized  that,  once  captured,  they  would  never  have  been  freed  and  allowed  to  return  to
Mars.
If the three of them were taken, they were finished. But what  if  only  two  were  taken?  He  had
pushed  it  aside  as  a  foolish  idea,  at  first.  The  boarding  party  would  never  rest  until  they  had
accounted for all three. They wouldn't dare go back  to  their  headquarters  leaving  one  live  man
behind to tell the story....
Unless they  thought  the  third  man  was  dead.  If  they  were  sure  of  that  ...  certain  of  it  ...  they
would not hesitate to take the remaining  two  away.  And  if,  by  chance,  the  third  man  wasn't  as
dead as they thought he was, and could  find  a  way  to  follow  them  home,  there  might  still  be  a
chance to free the other two.
It was then that he thought of the Scavenger, and knew that he had found a way.
In the cabin of the little scout ship he had worked swiftly, fearful that at any minute one of the
marauders might come aboard to search it.  Tom  was  no  rocket  pilot,  but  he  did  know  that  the
count-down was automatic, and that every ship could run on an autopilot, as a drone, following a
prescribed  course  until  it  ran  out  of  fuel.  Even  the  shell-evasion  mechanism  could  be  set  on
automatic....
Quickly he set the autopilot, plotted a simple high school math course for the ship, a course the
Ranger ship would be certain to see, and to fire upon. He set the count-down clock to give himself
plenty of time for the next step.
Both the airlock to the Scavenger and to the orbit-ship worked on electric motors. The Scavenger
 was grappled to the orbit-ship's hull by magnetic  cables.  Tom  dug  into  the  ship's  repair  locker,
found the wires and fuses that he needed, and swiftly started to work.
It was an ingenious device. The inner airlock door in the orbit-ship was triggered to a fuse. He

had left it ajar; the moment it was closed, by anyone intending to  board  the  Scavenger, the  fuse
would  burn,  a  circuit  would  open,  and  the  little  ship's  autopilot  would  go  on  active.  The  ship
would blast away from its moorings, head out toward Mars....
And the fireworks would begin. All that  he  would  have  to  worry  about  then  would  be  getting
himself aboard the Ranger ship without being detected.
Which was almost impossible. But he knew there was a way. There was one place no one would
think to look  for  him,  if  he  could  manage  to  keep  out  of  range  of  the  viewscreen  lenses  ...  the
outer hull of the ship. If he could clamp himself to the hull, somehow, and manage to cling there
during blastoff, he could follow Greg and Johnny right home.
He checked the fuse on the airlock once again to make certain it would work. Then he waited,
hidden  behind  the  little  scout  ship's  hull,  until  the  orbit-ship  swung  around  into  shadow.  He
checked his suit dials ... oxygen  for  twenty-two  hours,  heater  pack  fully  charged,  soda-ash  only
half saturated ... it would do. Above him he could see the rear jets of the Ranger. He  swung  out
onto the orbit-ship's hull, and began crawling up toward the enemy ship.
It was slow going. Every pressure suit had magnetic boots and hand-pads to enable crewmen to
go outside and make repairs on the  hull  of  a  ship  in  transit.  Tom  clung,  and  moved,  and  clung
again, trying to reach the protecting hull of the Ranger before the orbit-ship swung him around to
the sun-side again....
He couldn't move fast enough. He saw the line of sunlight coming around the ship as  it  swung
full into the sun. He froze, crouching motionless. If somebody on the Ranger spotted him  now,  it
was all over. He was exposed like a lizard on a rock. He waited, hardly daring to breathe, as the
ship spun ponderously around, carrying him into shadow again.
And  nothing  happened.  He  started  crawling  upward  again,  reached  up  to  grab  the  mooring
cable,  and  swung  himself  across  to  the  hull  of  the  Ranger.  The  airlock  hung  open;  he  scuttled
behind it, clinging to the hull in its shadow just  as  Greg  and  Johnny  were  herded  across  by  the
Jupiter Equilateral guards.
Then  he  waited.  There  was  no  sound,  no  sign  of  life.  After  awhile  the  Ranger's  inner  lock
opened, and a  group  of  men  hurried  across  to  the  orbit-ship.  Probably  a  searching  party,  Tom
thought. Soon the men came back, then returned to the orbit-ship.  After  another  minute,  he  felt
the vibration of the Scavenger's motors, and he knew that his snare had been triggered.
He saw the little  ship  break  free  and  streak  out  in  its  curving  trajectory.  He  saw  the  homing
shells  burst  from  the  Ranger's  tubes.  The  Scavenger  vanished  from  his  range  of  vision,  but
moments later he saw the sudden flare of light reflected against the hull of the orbit-ship, and he
knew his plan had worked, but the ordeal lay ahead.
And at the end of it, he might really be a dead man.
* * * * *
Hours later, the last group of looters left the orbit-ship, and the airlock to  the  Ranger  clanged
shut. Tom heard the sucking sound of the air-tight seals, then silence. The orbit-ship  was  empty,
its insides gutted, its engines no  longer  operable.  The  Ranger  hung  like  a  long  splinter  of  silver
alongside her hull, poised and ready to move on.
He knew that the time had come. Very soon the blastoff and the accelleration would begin. He
had a few moments to find a position of safety, no more.
Quickly,  he  began  scrambling  toward  the  rear  of  the  Ranger's  hull,  hugging  the  metal  sides,
moving sideways like a crab.  Ahead,  he  knew,  the  viewscreen  lenses  would  be  active;  if  one  of
them picked him up, it would be quite a jolt to the men inside the ship ... but it would be the end of
his free ride.
But the major  peril  was  the  blastoff.  Once  the  engines  cut  off,  the  ship  would  be  in  free  fall.

Then he could cling easily to the hull, walk all over it if he chose to, with the aid of his boots and
hand-pads. But unless he found a way to anchor himself firmly to the hull during blastoff, he could
be flung off like a pebble.
He heard a whirring sound, and saw the magnetic mooring cables jerk. The ship was preparing
for blastoff. Automatic motors were drawing the cables and grappling plates into the hull. Moving
quickly, Tom reached the rear cable. Here was his anchor, something to hold him tight to the hull!
With one hand he loosened the web belt of his suit, looped it over a corner of the grappling plate
as it pulled in to the hull.
The plate pulled tight against the belt. Each plate fit into a shallow excavation in the hull, fitting
so tightly that the plates were all but invisible when they were in place. Tom felt himself pulled in
tightly as the plate gripped the belt against the metal, and the whirring of the motor stopped.
For an instant it looked like the answer. The belt was wedged tight ... he couldn't possibly pull
loose  without  ripping  the  nylon  webbing  of  the  belt.  But  a  moment  later  the  motor  started
whirring again. The plate pushed out from the hull a few inches, then started back, again pulling
in the belt....
A good  idea  that  just  wouldn't  work.  The  automatic  machinery  on  a  spaceship  was  built  to
perfection; nothing could  be  permitted  to  half-work.  Tom  realized  what  was  happening.  Unless
the plate fit perfectly in its place, the cable motor could not shut off, and presently an alarm signal
would start flashing on the control panel.
He pulled the belt  loose,  reluctantly.  He  would  have  to  count  on  his  boots  and  his  hand-pads
alone.
He searched the rear hull, looking for some break in the  polished  metal  that  might  serve  as  a
toehold.  To  the  rear  the  fins  flared  out,  supported  by  heavy  struts.  He  made  his  way  back,
crouching close to the hull, and straddled one of the struts. He jammed his magnetic boots down
against the hull, and wrapped his arms around the strut with all his strength.
Clinging there, he waited.
It wasn't a good position. The metal of the strut was polished and slick, but it  was  better  than
trying  to  cling  to  the  open  hull.  He  tensed  now,  not  daring  to  relax  for  fear  that  the  blastoff
accelleration would slam him when he was unprepared.
Deep  in  the  ship,  the  engines  began  to  rumble.  He  felt  it  rather  than  heard  it,  a  low-pitched
vibration  that  grew  stronger  and  stronger.  The  Ranger  would  not  need  a  great  thrust  to  move
away  from  the  orbit-ship  ...  but  if  they  were  in  a  hurry,  they  might  start  out  at  nearly
Mars-escape....
The jets flared, and something slammed him down against the fin strut. The Ranger moved out,
its engines roaring, accellerating hard. Tom felt as though he had been hit by a ton of rock. The
strut seemed to press in against his chest; he could not breathe. His hands were sliding, and he felt
the pull on his boots. He tightened  his  grip  desperately.  This  was  it.  He  had  to  hang  on,  had  to
hang on....
He  saw  his  boot  on  the  hull  surface,  sliding  slowly,  creeping  back  and  stretching  his  leg,
suddenly it  broke  loose;  he  lurched  to  one  side,  and  the  other  boot  began  sliding.  There  was  a
terrible ache in his arms, as though some malignant giant were tearing at him, trying  to  wrench
him loose as he fought for his hold.
There was one black instant when he knew he could not hold on another second. He could  see
the blue flame of the jet streaming behind  him,  the  cold  blackness  of  space  beyond  that.  It  had
been a fool's idea, he thought in despair, a million-to-one shot that he had taken, and lost....
And  then  the  pressure  stopped.  His  boots  clanged  down  on  the  hull,  and  he  almost  lost  his
hand-grip. He stretched an arm, shook himself, took a great painful breath, and then clung to the
strut, almost sobbing, hardly daring to move.

The ordeal was over. Somewhere, far ahead, an orbit-ship was waiting for the Ranger to return.
He would have to be ready for the braking thrust and the side-maneuvering thrusts, but he would
manage to hold on. Crouching against the fin, he would be invisible to viewers on the orbit-ship ...
and who would be looking for a man clinging to the outside of a scout-ship?
Tom sighed, and waited. Jupiter Equilateral would have its prisoners, all right. He wished now
that he  had  not  discarded  the  stunner,  but  those  extra  pounds  might  have  made  the  difference
between life and death during the blastoff. And at least he was not completely unarmed.  He  still
had Dad's revolver at his side.
He smiled to himself. The pirates would have their prisoners, indeed ... but they would have one
factor to deal with that they had not counted on.
* * * * *
For Greg it was a bitter, lonely trip.
After ten hours they saw the huge Jupiter  Equilateral  orbit-ship  looming  up  in  the  viewscreen
like  a  minor  planet.  Skilfully  Doc  maneuvered  the  ship  into  the  launching  rack.  The  guards
unstrapped the prisoners, and handed them pressure suits.
Moments later they were in a section in crews' quarters where they stripped off their suits. This
orbit-ship was much larger than Roger Hunter's; the gravity was almost Mars-normal, and it was
comforting just to stretch and relax their cramped muscles.
As long as they didn't think of what was ahead.
Finally  Johnny  grinned  and  slapped  Greg's  shoulder.  "Cheer  up,"  he  said.  "We'll  be  honored
guests for a while, you can bet on that."
"For a while," Greg said bitterly.
Just then the hatchway opened. "Well, who do we have here?" a familiar voice said. "Returning
a call, you might say. And maybe this time you'll be ready for a bit of bargaining."
They turned to see the heavy face and angry eyes of Merrill Tawney.
8. The Scavengers of Space
The casual observer might have been fooled. Tawney's guard was down only for an instant; then
the expression of cold fury and determination on his face dropped away as though the shutter of a
camera  had  clicked,  and  he  was  all  smiles  and  affability.  They  were  honored  guests  here,  one
would  have  thought,  and  this  pudgy  agent  of  the  Jupiter  Equilateral  combine  was  their  genial
host, anxious for their welfare, eager to do anything he could for their comfort....
They were amazed by the luxuriousness  of  the  ship.  For  the  next  few  hours  they  received  the
best treatment, sumptuous accommodations, excellent food.
They  were  finishing  their  second  cup  of  coffee  when  Tawney  asked,  "Feeling  better,
gentlemen?"
"You do things in a big way," Johnny said. "This is real coffee, made from grounds. Must have
cost a fortune to ship it out here."
Tawney  spread  his  hands.  "We  keep  it  for  special  occasions.  Like  when  we  have  special
visitors."
"Even when the visits aren't voluntary," Greg added sourly.
"We have to be realistic,"  Tawney  said.  "Would  you  have  come  if  we  invited  you?  Of  course
not. You gentlemen chose to come out to the Belt in spite of my warnings. You thus  made  things
very awkward for us, upset certain of our plans." He looked at Greg. "We don't ordinarily allow
people to upset our plans, but now we find that we're forced to include you in our plans, whether
you happen to like the idea or not."
"You're doing a lot of talking," Greg said. "Why don't you come to the point?"

Tawney was no longer smiling. "We happen to know that your father struck a rich lode on one
of his claims."
"That's interesting," Greg said. "Did Dad tell you that?"
"He didn't have to. A man can't keep a secret like that, not for very long. Ask your friend here,
if you don't believe me. And we make it our business to know what's going on out here. We have
to, in order to survive."
"Well, suppose you heard right. The law says that what a man finds on his own claim is his."
"Certainly," Tawney said. "Nobody would think of claim-jumping, these days. But when a man
happens  to  die  before  he  can  bring  in  his  bonanza,  then  it's  a  question  of  who  gets  there  first,
wouldn't you think?"
"Not when the man is murdered," Greg said hotly, "not by a long shot."
"But you can't prove that your father was murdered."
"If I could, I wouldn't be here."
"Then I think we'll stick to the law," Tawney said, "and call it an accident."
"And what about my brother? Was that an accident?"
"Ah,  yes,  your  brother."  Tawney's  eyes  hardened.  "Quite  a  different  matter,  that.  Sometimes
Doc tends to be over-zealous in carrying out his assigned duties. I can assure you that he has been
... disciplined."
"That's not going to help Tom very much."
"Unfortunately  not,"  Tawney  said.  "Your  brother  made  a  very  foolish  move,  under  the
circumstances. But from a practical point of view, perhaps it's not entirely a tragedy."
"What do you mean by that?"
"From what I've heard," Tawney said, "you didn't  have  much  use  for  your  twin  brother.  And
now you certainly won't have to share your father's legacy...."
It was too much. With a roar Greg swung at the little fat man. The blow caught Tawney full in
the jaw, jerked his head back. Greg threw his shoulder into a hard  left,  slamming  Tawney  back
against the wall. The guard charged across the room, dragging them apart as Tawney blubbered
and  tried  to  cover  his  face.  Greg  dug  his  elbow  into  the  guard's  stomach,  twisted  away  and
started  for  Tawney  again.  Then  Johnny  caught  his  arm  and  spun  him  around.  "Stop  it,"  he
snapped. "Use your head, boy...."
Greg stopped, glaring at Tawney and gasping for breath. The company man picked himself up,
rubbing his hand  across  his  mouth.  For  a  moment  he  trembled  with  rage.  Then  he  gripped  the
table with  one  hand,  forcibly  regaining  his  control.  He  even  managed  a  sickly  smile.  "Just  like
your father," he said, "too hot-headed for your own good. But we'll let it pass. I brought you here
to make you an offer, a very generous offer, and I'll still make it. I'm a businessman, when I want
something I want I bargain for it. If I have to share a profit to get it, I share the profit. All right ...
you know where your father's strike is. We want it. We can't find it, so you've got us over a barrel.
We're ready to bargain."
Greg started forward. "I wouldn't bargain with you for...."
"Shut up, Greg," Johnny said.
Greg stared at him. The big miner's voice had cracked like a whip; now he was drawing Merrill
Tawney aside, speaking rapidly into his ear. Tawney listened, shot  a  venomous  glance  across  at
Greg, and finally nodded. "All right," he said, "but I can't wait forever...."
"You won't have to."
Tawney turned to the guard. "You have your orders," he said. "They're to have these quarters,
and the freedom of the ship, except for the outer level. They're not to be harmed, and they're not

to be out of your sight except when they're locked in here. Is that clear?"
The guard  nodded.  Tawney  looked  at  Johnny,  and  started  for  the  door,  still  rubbing  his  jaw.
"We'll talk again later," he said, and then he was gone.
When the guard had left, and the lock buzzed in the door, Johnny looked at Greg and shook his
head sadly. "You just about fixed things, boy, you really did. You've got  to  use  your  head  if  you
want to stay alive a while, that's all. Look, there isn't going to be any bargaining with Tawney, he
just doesn't work that way. It's heads he wins, tails we lose. Once he has what he wants we won't
last six minutes. All right, then there's just one thing that can keep us alive ... stalling him. We've
got to make him think you'll give in if he plays his cards right."
Greg was silent for a minute. "I hadn't thought of it that way."
"And we've got to use the  time  we  have  to  find  some  way  to  break  for  it."  Johnny  stood  up,
staring around the luxurious lounge. "If you want my opinion, it's going to take some pretty fancy
footwork to get out of here with our skins."
* * * * *
True to his word, Tawney had given them the freedom of the ship. Greg and Johnny discovered
that their guard was also an excellent guide. All day he had been leading them through the ship,
chatting and answering their questions about asteroid mining, until they  almost  forgot  that  they
were really prisoners here. And the guard's obvious pride in the scope and skill of his  company's
mining operations was strangely infectious.
Watching the Jupiter Equilateral ship in operation, Greg felt  his  heart  sink.  Here  was  a  huge,
powerful organization, with all the equipment and men and know-how they could ever need. How
could  one  man,  or  two  or  three  in  a  team,  hope  to  compete  with  them?  For  the  independent
miner, the only hope was the Big Strike, the single lode that could make him rich. He might work
all his life without finding it, and then stumble upon it by sheer chance....
But  if  he  couldn't  keep  it  when  he  found  it,  then  what?  What  if  the  great  mining  company
became so strong that they could be their own law in the Belt? What if they grew strong enough
and  powerful  enough  to  challenge  the  United  Nations  on  Mars  itself,  and  gain  control  of  the
entire mining industry? What chance would the independent miner have then?
It  was  a  frightening  picture.  Suddenly  something  began  to  make  sense  to  Greg;  he  realized
something about his father that he had never known before.
Roger Hunter had been a miner, yes. But he had been something  else  too,  something  far  more
important than just a miner.
Roger Hunter had been a fighter, fighting to the end for something he believed in....
Tawney interrupted Greg's thought.
"Quite an operation," he said.
Greg looked at him. "So I see."
"And very efficient, too. Our men have everything they need to work with. We can mine at far
less cost than anyone else."
"But you still can't stand the idea of independent miners working the Belt," Greg said.
Tawney's eyebrows went up. "But why not? There's lots of room  out  here.  Our  operation  with
Jupiter  Equilateral  is  no  different  from  an  independent  miner's  operation.  We  aren't  different
kinds of people."  Tawney  smiled.  "When  you  get  right  down  to  it,  we're  both  exactly  the  same
thing ... scavengers in space, vultures picking over the dead remains to see what we can find. We
come  out  to  the  asteroids,  and  we  bring  back  what  we  want  and  leave  the  rest  behind.  And  it
doesn't matter whether we've got one ship working or four hundred ... we're still just scavengers."
"With just one difference," Greg said, turning away from the viewscreen.

"Difference?"
Greg nodded. "Even vultures don't kill their own," he said.
* * * * *
Later,  when  they  were  alone  in  their  quarters  again,  Greg  and  Johnny  stared  at  each  other
gloomily.
"Didn't you see anything that might help us?" Greg said.
"Not  much.  For  an  orbit-ship,  this  place  is  a  fortress.  I  got  a  good  look  at  that  scout  ship
coming in ... it was armed to the teeth. Probably they all are. And they're keeping a guard now at
every airlock."
"So we're sewed up tight," Greg said.
"Looks that way. They've got us, boy, and I think Tawney's patience is wearing thin, too. We're
either going to have to produce or else."
"But what can we do?"
"Start bluffing."
"It seems to me we're just about bluffed out."
"I mean talk business," Johnny said. "Tell Tawney what he wants to know."
"When we don't know any more than he does? How?"
Johnny  Coombs  scratched  his  jaw.  "I've  been  thinking  about  that,"  he  said  slowly,  "and  I
wonder if we don't know a whole lot more than we think we do."
"Like what?" Greg said.
"We've all been looking for the same thing ... a Big Strike, a bonanza lode. Tawney's men have
raked over every one of your Dad's claims, and they haven't turned up a thing." Johnny looked at
Greg. "Makes you wonder a little, doesn't it? Your Dad was smart, but he was no magician. And
how does a man go about hiding something like a vein of ore?"
"I don't know," Greg said. "It doesn't seem possible."
"It  isn't  possible,"  Johnny  said  flatly.  "There's  only  one  possible  explanation,  and  we've  been
missing it all along. Whatever he found, it wasn't an ore strike. It was something else, something far
different from anything we've been thinking of."
Greg stared at him. "But if it wasn't an ore strike, what was it?"
"I don't know," Johnny said. "But I'm sure of one thing ... it was something  important  enough
that  he  was  ready  to  die  before  he'd  reveal  it.  And  that  means  it  was  important  enough  that
Tawney won't dare kill us until he finds out what it was."
9. The Invisible Man
Crouching  back  into  the  shadow,  Tom  Hunter  waited  as  the  heavy  footsteps  moved  up  the
corridor, then back down, then up and down again. He peered around the corner for a  moment,
looking  quickly  up  and  down  the  curving  corridor.  The  guard  was  twenty  yards  away,  moving
toward him in  a  slow  measured  pace.  Tom  jerked  his  head  back,  then  peered  out  again  as  the
footsteps receded.
The  guard  was  a  big  man,  with  a  heavy-duty  stunner  resting  in  the  crook  of  his  elbow.  He
paused,  scratched  himself,  and  resumed  his  pacing.  Tom  waited,  hoping  that  something  might
distract the big man, but he moved stolidly back and forth, not too alert, but far too alert to risk
breaking out into the main corridor.
Tom moved back into the darkened corridor where  he  was  standing,  trying  to  decide  what  to
do.  It  was  a  side  corridor,  and  a  blind  alley;  it  ended  in  a  large  hatchway  marked
HYDROPONICS, and there were no branching corridors. If he were discovered here, there would

be no place to hide.
But he knew that he could never hope to accomplish his purpose here....
A hatch clanged open, and there were more footsteps  down  the  main  corridor  as  a  change  of
guards hurried by. There was a rumble of voices, and Tom listened to catch the words.
"... don't care what you think, the boss says tighten it up...."
"But they got them locked in...."
"So tell it to the boss. We're supposed  to  check  every  compartment  in  the  section  every  hour.
Now get moving...."
The footsteps moved up and down the corridor then, and Tom heard hatches clanging open. If
they sent a light down this spur ... he  turned  to  the  hatch,  spun  the  big  wheel  on  the  door,  and
slipped inside just as the footsteps came closer.
The stench inside was almost overpowering. The big, darkened room was extremely warm, the
air  damp  with  vapor.  The  plastic-coated  walls  streamed  with  moisture.  Against  the  walls  Tom
could see the great hydroponic vats that held the yeast and algae cultures that fed the crew of the
ship. Water was splashing in one of  the  vats,  and  there  was  a  gurgling  sound  as  nutrient  broth
drained out, to be replaced with fresh.
He moved swiftly across the compartment, into a darkened area  behind  the  rows  of  vats,  and
crouched down. He heard footsteps, and the ring of metal as the hatchway came open. One of the
guards  walked  in,  peered  into  the  gloom,  wrinkled  his  nose,  and  walked  out  again,  closing  the
hatchway behind him.
It would do for a while ... if he didn't suffocate ... but if this ship was organized like smaller ones,
it  would  be  a  blind  alley.  Modern  hydroponic  tanks  did  not  require  much  servicing,  once  the
cultures were growing; the broth was drained automatically and sluiced through a series of pipes
to the rendering plant where the yeasts could be flavored and pressed into  surrogate  steaks  and
other items for spaceship cuisine. There would be no other entrances, no way to leave except the
way he had come in.
And  with  the  guards  on  duty,  that  was  out  of  the  question.  He  waited,  listening,  as  the
check-down continued in nearby compartments. Then  silence  fell  again.  The  heavy  yeast  aroma
had grown more and more oppressive; now suddenly a fan went on with a whir, and a cool draft
of freshened reprocessed air poured down from the ventilator shaft above his head.
Getting  into  the  orbit-ship  had  been  easier  than  he  had  hoped.  In  the  excitement  as  the  new
prisoners  were  brought  aboard,  security  measures  had  been  lax.  No  one  had  expected  a  third
visitor; in consequence, no one looked for one. Huge as  it  was,  the  Jupiter  Equilateral  ship  had
never been planned as a prison, and it had taken time to stake out the guards in a security system
that was at all effective. In addition, every man who served as a guard had been taken from duty
somewhere else on the ship.
So  there  had  been  no  guard  at  the  airlock  in  the  first  few  moments  after  the  prisoners  were
taken off the Ranger ship. Tom had waited until the ship was moored, clinging to the fin strut. He
watched Greg and Johnny taken through the lock, and soon the last of the crew had crossed over
after  securing  the  ship.  Presently  the  orbit-ship  airlock  had  gone  dark,  and  only  then  had  he
ventured  from  his  place  of  concealment,  creeping  along  the  dark  hull  of  the  Ranger  ship  and
leaping across to the airlock.
A momentary  risk,  then,  as  he  opened  the  lock.  In  the  control  room,  he  knew,  a  signal  light
would blink on a panel as the lock was opened. Tom moved as quickly as he could, hoping that in
the excitement of the new visitors, the signal would go unnoticed ... or if spotted, that the spotter
would assume it was only a crewman making a final trip across to the Ranger ship.
But  once  inside,  he  began  to  realize  the  magnitude  of  his  problem.  This  was  not  a  tiny

independent  orbit-ship  with  a  few  corridors  and  compartments.  This  was  a  huge  ship,  a  vast
complex of corridors and compartments and holds. There was probably a crew of a thousand men
on this ship ... and there was no sign where Greg and Johnny might have been taken.
He moved forward, trying to keep to side corridors and darkened areas. In  the  airlock  he  had
wrapped up his pressure suit and stored it on a rack; no one would notice it there, and it might be
handy later. He had strapped his father's gun case to his side, some comfort, but a small one.
Now, crouching behind the yeast vat, he lifted out the gun, hefted it  idly  in  his  hand.  It  was  a
weapon, at least. He was not well acquainted with guns, and in the shadowy light it seemed to him
that this one looked odd for a revolver; it even felt wrong, out of balance in his hand. He slipped
it back in the case. After all, it had been fitted to Dad's hand, not his. And Johnny or Greg would
know how to use it better than he would.
If he could find them. But to do that, he would have to search the ship. He would have to move
about, he couldn't just wait in a storage hold. And with all the guards that were posted, he would
certainly stumble into one of them sooner or later if he tried leaving this spot....
He shook his head, and started for the hatch. He would have to chance it. There was no way to
tell how much time he had, but it was a sure bet that he didn't have very long.
In the spur corridor again, he waited until the guard's footsteps were muffled and distant. Then
he darted out into the main corridor, moving swiftly and silently away from the guard. At the first
hatchway he ducked inside, waited in the darkness, panting....
The guard had stopped walking. Then his footsteps resumed, but more quickly, coming down the
corridor. He stopped, almost  outside  the  hatchway  door.  "Funny,"  Tom  heard  him  mutter.  "I'd
have sworn...."
Tom held his breath, waiting. This was a storage hold, but he didn't dare to move, even to take
cover. The guard stood motionless for a moment, then grunted, and resumed his slow pacing.
When he had moved away Tom caught his breath in huge gasps, his heart beating in his throat.
It was no use, he thought in despair. Once or twice he might get away with it, but sooner or later
a guard  would  be  alert  enough  to  investigate  an  obscure  noise,  a  flicker  of  movement  in  the
corner of his eye....
There had to be another way. His eye probed the storage hold, hopelessly, and then stopped on a
metal grill in the wall.
For a moment, he didn't recognize what it was. Then there was a whoosh-whoosh-whoosh as a
fan went on, and he felt cool air against his cheek. He held out his hand to the grill, found the air
coming from there.
A ventilation  shaft.  Every  space  craft  had  to  have  reconditioning  units  for  the  air  inside  the
ship; the men inside needed a constant supply of fresh oxygen, but even more, without pumps to
move the air in each compartment  they  would  soon  suffocate  from  the  accumulation  of  carbon
dioxide in the air  they  breathed  out,  or  bake  from  the  heat  their  bodies  radiated.  On  the  other
hand,  the  yeasts  and  algae  required  carbon  dioxide  and  yielded  copious  amounts  of  oxygen  as
they grew.
In  Roger  Hunter's  little  orbit-ship  the  ventilation  shafts  were  small,  a  loose  network  of
foot-square  ducts  leading  from  the  central  pumps  and  air-reconditioning  units  to  every
compartment in the ship. But in a ship of this size....
The grill was over a yard wide, four feet tall. It started about shoulder height and ran up to the
overhead. The ducts would network the ship, opening into every compartment, and no one would
ever open them unless something went wrong.
And then he was laughing out loud,  working  the  grill  out  of  the  slots  that  held  it  to  the  wall,
trying to make his hands work in his excitement.

He knew he had found his answer.
The grill came loose, lifted  down  in  a  piece.  He  stopped  short  as  footsteps  approached  in  the
corridor, paused, and went on. Then he peered into the black gaping hole behind the grill. It was
big enough for a man to crawl in. He shinned up into the hole, and pulled  the  grill  back  into  its
slot behind him.
Somewhere far away he heard a throbbing of giant pumps. There was a rush  of  cool  fresh  air
past his cheek, cold when it contacted the sweat pouring down his  forehead.  He  could  not  quite
stand up, but there was plenty of room for him to crouch and move.
Ahead of him was a black tunnel, broken only by a patch of light coming through the grill that
opened into the next compartment. He started into the blackness, his heart racing.
Somewhere in the ship Johnny Coombs and Greg Hunter were prisoners ... but now, Tom knew,
there was a way to escape.
* * * * *
It was a completely different world, a world within a world, a world of darkness and silence, of
a thousand curving and intersecting tunnels, some large, some small. For hours it seemed to him
that he had been wandering  through  a  tomb,  moving  through  the  corridors  of  a  dead  ship,  the
lone surviving crewman. There was some contact with the other world, of course, the world of the
spaceship outside ... each compartment had its metal grill, and he passed many of them. But there
were like doors that only he knew existed. He met no one in these corridors, there was no danger
of sudden discovery and arrest in these dark alleys....
His boots had made too much noise as he started out, so he had slipped them off, hanging them
from his belt and moving on in his stocking feet. As he went from duct to duct, he had an almost
ridiculous feeling of freedom and power. In every sense, he was an invisible man. Not one soul on
this great ship knew he was here, or even suspected. He had the run of the ship, complete freedom
to  go  wherever  he  chose.  He  could  move  from  compartment  to  compartment  as  silently  and
invisibly as if he had no substance at all.
* * * * *
He knew the first job was to learn the pattern of the ducts, and orientation was a problem. He
had heard stories of men getting lost in the deep underground mining tunnels on Mars, wandering
in circles for days until their food gave out and they starved. And there was that hazard here, for
every duct looked like every other one.
But there was a difference here, because the ducts curved just as the main ship's corridors did.
He could always identify the center of the ship by the force of false gravity pulling the other way.
Furthermore, as the ducts  drew  closer  to  the  pumps  and  reconditioning  units,  they  opened  into
larger vents, and the noise of the pumps thundered in his ears. After an hour of exploration, Tom
was certain that from any place in the ship he could at least find his way to the outer layer, and
from there to one of the scout-ship airlocks.
Finding Greg and Johnny was quite a different matter.
He could not see enough through the compartment grills to identify just what the compartments
were; he was forced to rely on what he could hear. The engine rooms were easily identified. In one
area he heard the banging of pots and pans,  the  steaming  of  kettles  ...  obviously  the  galley.  He
found the control area. He could hear the clatter of typing instruments, the click-click-click of the
computers working out the orbits and trajectories for the scout-ships as they moved out from the
orbit-ship  or  came  back  in.  In  another  compartment  he  heard  a  dispatcher  chattering  his  own
special code-language into a microphone in a low-pitched voice. He passed another grill, and then
stopped short as a familiar voice drifted through.
Merrill Tawney's voice.

Tom hugged the grill, straining to catch the words. The company man sounded angry; the man
he was talking to sounded even angrier. "I can't help what you want or don't want, Merrill, I can
only  report  what  we've  found,  and  that's  nothing  at  all.  Every  one  of  those  claims  has  been
searched twice over. Doc and his boys went over them, and we didn't find anything they missed. I
think you're barking up the wrong tree."
"There's got to be something," Tawney said, his voice tight with  anger.  "Hunter  couldn't  have
taken anything away from there, he didn't have a chance to. You read the reports..."
"I know," the other said wearily, "I know what the reports said."
"Then what he found is still there. There's no other possibility," Tawney said.
"We went over that rock with a microscope. We blew it to shreds. Assay has gone through the
fragments literally piece by piece. They found low grade iron, a trace of nickel, a little tin, and lots
of granite. If we never found anything richer than that, we'd have been out of business ten years
ago."
There was a long silence. Tom pressed closer to  the  grill.  Then  he  heard  Tawney  slam  his  fist
into his palm. "You know what Roger Hunter's doing, don't you?" he said. "He's making fools of
us, that's what! The man's dead, and he's making us look like idiots. If we hadn't been so sure we
had the lode spotted ..." He broke off. "Well, that's done, we can't undo it. But this brat of his...."
"Any luck there?"
"Not a word. He's playing coy."
"Maybe he doesn't know anything. Doc made a bad mistake when  he  blasted  the  other  one  ...
suppose he was the only one that knew."
"All right, it was a mistake," Tawney snapped. "What was he supposed to do, let him get back
to Mars? We've got a good front there, but it's not that good. If the United Nations gets a toehold
out here, the whole Belt will go into their pocket, you realize that. They're waiting for us to make
one slip." He paused,  and  Tom  heard  him  pacing  the  compartment.  "But  I think  we've  got  our
boy. This one knows. We've been spoiling him so far, that's all. Well, now we start digging. When I
get through with him, he'll be begging us to let him tell. You just watch me, as soon as  the  okay
comes through...."
Tom  drew  back  from  the  grill,  moving  on  in  the  darkness.  So  far  he  had  not  rushed  his
exploration ... there was a chance to use the ducts for escape, he wanted to know them well. But
now he knew the hour was getting late. So far Greg and Johnny had been stalling Tawney ... but
Tawney was getting impatient.
He moved quickly and he thought again of what Tawney had said. Tawney was right about one
thing ... there was no way that Dad could have hidden a Big Strike so nobody could find it. It had
to be there....
And yet it wasn't. He and Greg hadn't found it. Tawney's men hadn't found it, either. Why not?
There must be a reason.
But he could not put his finger on it.
Half an hour later he was seriously worried. Half the compartments in the area were deserted,
the men leaving for the cafeteria. The thought reminded Tom how hungry he was, and thirsty. His
small emergency ration kit was empty. He toyed with the thought of sneaking into a food storage
compartment, then thrust it out of his mind as too risky. He had to find Greg and Johnny before
anything.
He passed a grill, and heard a murmur of voices; something in the deep bass rumble caught his
ear, and he stopped, listened.
The voices stopped also.
He waited for them to begin, pressing against the grill. Johnny Coombs  was  not  the  only  man

with a deep bass voice,  he  might  have  been  mistaken.  He  listened,  but  there  was  no  sound.  He
heard the whir of a fan begin, still no sound, not even footsteps.
And then it happened, so fast he was taken completely off guard. The grill suddenly gave way,
pitching him forward into the compartment. Something struck him behind the ear as he fell; there
was  a  grunt,  a  sharp  command,  and  he  was  pinned  to  the  floor  in  the  semi-darkness  of  the
compartment.
Then he heard a gasp, and he opened his eyes. He was  staring  into  his  brother's  startled  face.
Greg was pinning his shoulders to the carpeted deck, and behind him Johnny Coombs had a  fist
raised....
But they had stopped in mid-air, like a tableau of puppets. Greg gaped, his jaw falling open, and
Tom  heard  himself  saying,  "What  are  you  trying  to  do,  kill  a  guy?  Seems  to  me  one  time  is
enough."
He had found them.
10. The Trigger
In the first instance of astonishment they were speechless. Later, Tom said it was the first time
in his life that he had ever seen Greg totally without words; his brother jumped back, as if he had
seen a ghost, and his mouth worked, but no sounds came out.
"Don't worry, it's me all right," Tom said, "and I'm mighty hungry."
Greg and Johnny stared at the black hole behind the grill ... and then Greg was pumelling him,
pounding him on the back, so excited  he  couldn't  get  a  sentence  out,  and  Johnny  was  hovering
over them, incredulous but forced to believe his eyes, like a father overwhelmed by the impossible
behavior  of  a  pair  of  unpredictable  children.  It  was  a  jubilant  reunion.  They  broke  open  the
cabinets  and  refrigerator  in  the  back  of  the  lounge  and  pulled  out  surro-ham  and  rolls,  while
Johnny got some coffee going. Tom was so famished he could hardly wait to make sandwiches of
the ham. He ate it as fast as he got it.
But finally he slowed up, got his mouth empty enough to talk. "All right,  let's  have  the  story,"
Greg said, still looking as though he couldn't believe his eyes. "The last we saw, you were blown
into atoms out there in that Scavenger ... you've  got  some  nerve  turning  up  now  and  scaring  us
half out of our skins...."
"You want me to go back in my hole?"
"Just sit still and talk!"
Tom told them, then, starting from the beginning.
Through  it  all  Greg  stared  in  admiration.  "We've  got  a  genius  among  us,  that's  all,"  he  said
finally. "And I always thought you were the timid one...."
"But what else could I do?" Tom said. "You know what they say about grabbing a tiger by the
tail ... once you get hold, you've got to hold on."
"Okay," Greg said, "but the next time I make a crack about your retiring nature, remind me to
stick my foot in my mouth."
"I'll do it for him," Johnny Coombs rumbled.
Tom  nodded  toward  the  open  grill.  "The  only  thing  I don't  see  is  how  you  knew  I  was  back
there."
Johnny grinned. "We were busy taking down the grill when you came along.  We'd  found  three
microphones in this place, and figured they might have one behind  the  grill.  And  then  we  heard
somebody breathing back there ... we thought they'd posted a guard back there, just to snoop us."
"Well, I'm glad you didn't hit him any harder...."
Johnny started to say something,  then  stopped,  cocked  his  head  toward  the  door.  There  were

footsteps in the corridor outside; they came closer, stopped by the door. "Quick," Johnny hissed,
"back inside!"
There was no time to look for other concealment. Tom leaped across the room, jumped up into
the shaft again, and Greg slammed the grate up into place just as the hatchway door swung open.
Merrill Tawney walked into the room, with two burly guards behind him.
* * * * *
For the first few seconds, Greg was certain that they were lost. He stood  with  his  back  to  the
ventilator grill, frozen in his tracks as the fat little company man came  in  the  room.  He  tried  to
keep  his  face  blank,  but  he  knew  he  wasn't  succeeding.  He  saw  the  puzzled  frown  form  on
Tawney's face.
The company man motioned the guards into the room, peered suspiciously at Greg and Johnny.
"Am I interrupting something, by any chance?"
"Nothing at all," Johnny blurted. "We were just talking."
"Talking."  Tawney  repeated  the  word  as  if  it  were  some  strange  language  he  didn't  quite
understand. He looked at the guard. "Let's just check them."
While  one  guard  patted  down  their  clothes,  the  other  withdrew  a  stunner,  held  it  on  ready.
Tawney prowled the lounge. He glanced  at  the  food  on  the  table,  then  reached  under  the  chair
cushion and withdrew the disconnected microphone, looked at the loose wires, and tossed it aside.
"They're clean," the guard said.
Tawney's face was a study of uneasiness, but he clearly could not pinpoint what the trouble was.
Finally  he  shrugged,  turned  on  the  smile  again,  although  his  eyes  remained  watchful.  "Well,
maybe you won't mind if I join in the talking for a while," he said. "You've been comfortable? No
complaints?"
"No complaints," Greg said.
"Then I presume we're ready to talk business." He looked at Greg.
"You said you were ready to bargain," Greg said, "but I haven't heard any terms yet."
"Terms? Very simple. You direct us to the lode, we give you half of everything we realize from
it," Tawney said, smiling.
"You mean you'll write us a contract? With a U.N. witness to it?"
"Well, hardly ... under the circumstances. I'm afraid you'll have to take our word."
Greg looked at  the  company  man,  and  shook  his  head.  "Not  that  I don't  trust  you,"  he  said,
"but I'm afraid I can't give you what you want," Greg said.
"Why not?"
"Because I don't know where Dad made his strike."
The company man's face darkened. "Somebody knows where it is. Your father would never have
found something like that without telling his own sons...."
"Sorry," Greg said. "Of course, I can tell you where you can find out, if you want to go look."
"We've already searched his records...."
"Some of his records," Greg said. "Not all of them. There was a compartment behind the main
control  panel  in  Dad's  orbit-ship.  Dad  used  it  to  store  deeds,  claims,  other  important  papers.
There was a packet of notes in there before your men fired on the ship. But of course, maybe you
searched more thoroughly, the second time."
Tawney stared at him  for  a  moment,  then  at  Johnny.  Johnny  Coombs  shrugged  his  shoulders
solemnly, and  shook  his  head.  Without  a  word,  the  little  company  man  walked  to  the  intercom
speaker on the wall. He spoke sharply into it, waited, then had a brief, pungent conversation with

someone. Then he turned back to Greg, his face heavy with suspicion. "You saw these papers?"
"Certainly I saw them. I didn't have time to read them through, but what else could they be?"
"Let me warn you," Tawney said coldly, "if I send a crew out there on a wild goose chase, the
party will be over when they get back, do you understand? You've been given every consideration.
If this is a fool's errand, you'll pay for it very dearly." He turned on his heel, snarled at one of the
guards. "I want them watched every minute," he said. "One of you stay with them constantly. It
won't take long to find out if this is a stall...."
He stalked out, and the hatchway clanged behind him. One guard went along; the big one with
the  stunner  stayed  behind,  eyeing  his  prisoners  unpleasantly.  The  stunner  was  in  his  hand,  the
safety off.
Johnny Coombs started  across  the  room  toward  the  kitchennette,  passing  close  to  the  guard.
Suddenly he turned, swung his fist heavily down  on  the  guard's  neck.  The  stunner  crackled,  but
Greg had jumped aside. Another blow from Johnny's fist sent the gun  flying.  Another  blow,  and
the guard's legs slid out from under him. He fell unconscious to the floor.
In an instant they were  across  the  room,  lifting  down  the  grill,  helping  Tom  out  of  his  hiding
place. "Okay, boy," Johnny said to Greg, "I guess you pulled the trigger with that story of yours."
"Not me," Greg said. "Tom did. He's the one that showed us the way  out  ...  the  same  way  he
came in."
* * * * *
The guard was out for a while, they made sure of that first. Then there was a hasty consultation.
"The airlocks are guarded," Johnny  said,  "and  if  they  tumble  to  the  ventilator  shafts,  they  can
smoke us out in no time. How are we going to get a  scout-ship  without  showing  ourselves?  For
that matter, how are we going to get a scout-ship away from here without being blown up the way
the Scavenger was blown up?"
"I think I know a way," Tom said. "We have to have something to keep a lot of the crew busy. If
we could get to the ship's generators and put them out of commission somehow, it might do it."
"Why?" Greg wanted to know.
"Because of the air supply," Tom said. "Without the generators, the fans won't run. They'll have
to get a crew to fix them or they'll suffocate."
"But that would only take a few men," Johnny said. "As soon as the generators went out, they'd
look for us, and if we were missing ... well, they'd have the whole crew beating the bushes for us.
It wouldn't be long before somebody thought of the ventilators."
"But we've got to do something, and do it fast," Tom said.
"I know." Johnny chewed his lip. "It's a good idea, but we need more than just the generators.
We've  got  to  disable  the  ship  ...  throw  so  many  things  at  them  so  fast  from  so  many  different
directions that they don't know which  way  to  turn.  That  means  we'd  need  to  split  up,  and  we'd
need weapons." He hefted the guard's Markheim. "One stunner between three of us isn't enough."
"Well, we have this." Tom unbuckled Roger Hunter's  gun  case  from  his  belt.  "Dad's  revolver.
It's  not  a  stunner,  but  it  might  help."  He  tossed  the  case  to  Johnny.  "I  can  give  you  both  a
rundown  on  how  the  shafts  go.  We  could  plan  to  meet  at  a  certain  spot  in  a  certain  length  of
time...."
He broke off, looking at Johnny.  The  big  miner  had  taken  Roger  Hunter's  gun  from  the  case,
and hefted it in his hand, started to check it automatically as Tom talked. But now his hand froze
as he stared at the weapon.
"What's wrong?" Tom asked.
"This gun is wrong," Johnny said. "All wrong. Where did you get this thing?"

"From Dad's spacer pack, the one the Patrol brought back. The Major gave it to us in Sun Lake
City." Tom peered at the gun. "Is it broken or something? It's just Dad's revolver...."
"It is, eh?" Johnny turned the gun over in his hand. "Whoever told you about guns?"
"What's wrong with it?"
There was an odd expression on Johnny's face as he handed the weapon back to Tom. "Take a
look at it," he said. "Tell me whether it's loaded or not."
Tom looked at it. Except for a  few  hours  on  the  firing  range,  he  had  had  no  experience  with
guns; he couldn't have taken down a Markheim and reassembled it if his life depended on it. But
he had seen his father take the old revolver out of the leather case many times before.
Now Tom could see that this was not the same gun.
The thing in his hand was large and awkward.  The  hand-grips  didn't  fit;  there  was  no  trigger
guard, and no trigger. Several inches along the gleaming metal barrel was a shiny stud, and below
it a dial with notches on it.
"That's funny," Tom said. "I've never seen this thing before."
Greg  took  it  from  him,  balanced  it  in  his  hand.  "Doesn't  feel  right,"  he  said.  "All  out  of
balance."
"Look at the barrel," Johnny said quietly.
Greg looked. There was no hole in the end of the barrel. "This thing's crazy," he said.
"And then some," Johnny said. "You haven't had this out of the case since you took it from the
pack?"
"Just once," said Tom. "And I put it right back.  I hardly  looked  at  it.  Look,  maybe  it's  just  a
new model Dad got."
"It's no new model. I'm not even sure it's a gun," Johnny said. "Doesn't feel like a gun."
"What happens when you push the stud here?" Greg asked.
Johnny licked his lips nervously. "Try it," he said.
Greg leveled the thing at the rear wall of the lounge and pressed  the  stud.  There  was  a  sharp
buzzing sound, and a blinding flash of blue light against the wall. It looked for all the world  like
the flash of a live power line shorting out. They squinted at the flash, rubbed their eyes....
And stared at the wall. Or at what was left of the wall, because most of the wall was gone. The
metal had bellied out in a six-foot hole into the storage hold beyond....
Johnny Coombs whistled. "This thing did that?" he whispered.
"It must have...."
"But  there's  no  gun  ever  made  that  could  do  that."  He  walked  over  to  the  hole  in  the  wall.
"That's half-inch steel plate. There's no way to pack that kind of energy into a hand gun."
They stared at the innocent-looking weapon in Greg's hand. "Whatever it is, Dad must have put
it in the gun-case."
"Yes, he must have," Johnny said.
"Well, don't you see what that means? Dad must have found it somewhere. Somewhere out here in
the Belt ... a gun that no man could have made...."
He took the weapon, ran his finger along the gleaming barrel. "I wonder," he said, "what else
Dad might have found out there."
* * * * *
Somewhere below them they heard a hatch clang  shut,  and  even  deeper  in  the  ship  generator
motors began throbbing in a steady even rhythm. In the silence of the lounge they could hear their
own breathing, and outside a thousand tiny sounds of the ship's activity were audible.

But now they had attention only for the odd-shaped piece of metal in Greg's hand, and for  the
hole that gaped in the wall.
"You think that this was what Dad found?" Greg said. "The Big Strike he told Johnny about?"
"It must be part of it," Tom said.
"But what is it? And where did it come from? It doesn't make sense," Greg protested.
"It doesn't make sense the way we've been looking at it," Tom said. "All we've found was some
gobbledegook in Dad's private log to tell us what he found ... but it couldn't have been a vein of
ore, or Tawney's men would have unearthed it. It had to be something else. Something that was so
big and important that Dad didn't even dare let Johnny in on it."
"Yes, that's been the craziest part of it, to me," Johnny said. "I've done a lot of mining with your
Dad. If he'd hit rich ore, he would have taken me out there to mine it with him. But he didn't. He
said it was something he had to work on alone for awhile, and he sent me back."
"As  if  he'd  found  something  that  scared  him,"  Tom  said,  "or  something  that  he  didn't
understand.  He  was  afraid  to  tell  anybody.  And  whatever  he  found,  he  managed  to  hide  it
somewhere, so that nobody would find it...."
"Then why didn't he hide this part of it, too?" Greg said.
"Maybe to be sure there was some trace left, if anything happened to him," Tom said.
They were silent for a moment. The only sound was the stertorous breathing of the unconscious
guard. "Well," Greg said finally, "I have to admit it makes  sense.  It  makes  other  things  add  up
better, too. Dad  was  no  fool,  he  must  have  known  that  Tawney  was  onto  something.  And  Dad
would never have risked his life for an ore strike. He'd either have made a deal with Tawney or let
him hijack the lode, if that was all there was to it. But there's still one big question ... where did he
hide what he found? And we aren't going to find the answer here." He walked over to the hole in
the wall.
"Made quite a mess of it, didn't it?" Johnny said.
"Looks like it.  I wonder  what  that  thing  would  do  to  a  ship's  generator  plant."  He  turned  to
Johnny.  "We  haven't  much  time.  With  this  thing,  we  could  tear  this  ship  apart,  leave  them  so
confused  they'll  never  know  what  broke  loose.  And  if  we  could  get  that  gun  back  to  Major
Briarton, he'd have to listen to us, and get the U.N. Patrol into the search...."
They had been so intent on their talking that they did not hear the footsteps in the corridor until
the door swung open. It was another guard, the one who had departed with Tawney. He stopped
short, blinking at his companion on the floor, and then  at  the  gaping  hole  in  the  wall.  When  he
saw the twins, side by side, his jaw sagged and a strangled sound came from his throat.
Then Johnny grabbed his arm, jerked him into the  lounge,  and  slammed  the  hatch  shut.  Greg
pulled the stunner from his holster and tossed it to Tom.  The  guard  let  out  a  roar,  twisted  free,
and met Johnny's fist as he came around. He sagged at the knees and slid to the floor beside the
other guard. "All right," Johnny said, "we've dealt the cards, now we'd better play the hand. Tom,
you first."
Tom pulled the ventilator grill down, and climbed up into the shaft. Greg followed, with Johnny
at his heels, pulling the grill back up into place from  the  inside.  They  waited  for  a  moment,  but
there was no sound from the lounge.
"All right," Johnny said breathlessly. "Let's move."
Swiftly they started down the dark tunnel.
11. The Haunted Ship
They did not  pause,  even  to  catch  their  breath,  for  the  first  twenty  minutes  as  Tom  led  them
swiftly and silently down through the maze of corridors and chutes that made  up  the  ventilation

system of the huge ship. Greg lost his bearing completely in the first twenty seconds; each time his
brother paused at a junction of tubes, he felt a wave of panic rise up in his throat ... suppose they
lost themselves in here! He heard Johnny's trousers flapping behind him, saw Tom's figure flit past
another grill up ahead, and plunged doggedly on.
It was amazingly hard to move quietly. Even in stocking feet they made  a  soft  thud  with  each
footfall.
But there was no sign of detection, no sound of alarm. Finally they came out into a large shaft
which allowed them to stand upright, and they stopped to catch their breath.
"Main tube to the living quarters," Tom said when they had caught up to him. "Joins with the
lower-level tube by a series of chutes. We've actually been circumnavigating the ship ... I wanted
to get as far away from that lounge compartment as possible, in case they check up on you right
away."
"We can't have much time," Johnny said. "That second guard must have been coming to relieve
the other, and when the first one doesn't report back, they'll smell something fishy."
* * * * *
They  talked  it  over  for  a  moment.  Johnny  had  been  careful  to  leave  the  hatchway  into  the
corridor ajar before he climbed into the ventilator shaft, and then he had pulled the shaft snugly
into place behind him. Anyone who came would find two unconscious guards, a burnt-out hole in
the wall, and the door unlocked.
"We'll  hope  that  he  takes  things  at  face  value,  and  assumes  we're  at  large  in  the  ship
somewhere, for awhile at least," Johnny said. "That hole in the wall is going to set them back  a
couple of steps, too."
"But they'll sound the alarm, at least," Tom said.
"You bet they will! They'll have every man on the crew shaking down the ship for  us.  But  they
may not think of the ventilators until they can't find us anywhere else."
"But sooner or later they're bound to think of it."
"That's true," Johnny said. "Unless they keep seeing us in the ship. The way I figure it, this crew
has been on battle stations plenty of times. They'll be able to search the whole ship in half an hour.
We're just going to have to show ourselves ... at least enough to keep them searching."
"Well, what if they do think of the ventilators?" Greg said. "They'd still have a time finding us."
"Maybe, but don't underestimate Tawney. He might just mask up his crew and flood  the  tubes
with cyanide."
They thought about that for a minute. There was no sound here but their own breathing, and the
low chug-chug-chug of the pumps somewhere deep in the ship. Momentarily they expected to hear
the raucous clang of the alarm bell, as some crew member or another walked into the lounge and
found them gone. But so far there was no sign they had  been  discovered  missing.  "No,"  Johnny
said finally, "if we just hide out in here, and hope for a chance at  one  of  the  scout  ships,  they'll
find us eventually. But we've got three big advantages, if we can figure out how to use them. That
fancy gun, for one. A way to get around the ship, for another ... and the fact that there's one more
of us than they count on." He flipped on his pocket flash, began drawing lines on the dusty floor
of the shaft. "My idea is to keep them so busy fighting little fires that they won't have a chance to
worry about where the big one is."
He drew a rough outline-sketch of  the  organization  of  the  ship.  "This  look  right  to  you,  from
what you've seen?" he asked Tom.
"Pretty much," Tom said. "There are more connecting tubes."
"All the better. We want to get the generators  with  our  little  toy  here  first.  That'll  darken  the
ship, and put the blowers out of commission in case they think of using gas. Also,  it  will  cut  out

their computers and missile-launching rigs, which might give us a chance to get a scout-ship away
in one piece if we could get aboard one."
"All right, the generators are first," Tom said. "But then what? There are four hundred men on
this ship. They'll have every airlock triple guarded. They'll block us for sure."
"Not when we get through, they won't," Johnny grinned. "We've got an old friend aboard who's
going to help us."
"Friend?"
"Ever hear of panic?" Johnny said. "Just listen a minute."
Quickly then, he outlined his plan. Tom and Greg listened, watched Johnny make marks with his
finger in the dust. When he finished, Greg whistled softly. "You  missed  your  life  work,"  he  said.
"You should have gone into crime."
"If I'd had a ghost to help me, I might have," Johnny said.
"It's perfect," Tom said, "if it works. But it all depends on one thing ... keeping it  rolling  after
we start...."
For  another  five  minutes  they  went  over  the  details.  Then  Johnny  clapped  them  each  on  the
shoulder. "It's up to you two," he said. "Let's go."
They moved down the large shaft to the place where it broke into several spurs. Johnny started
down the chute toward the engine rooms; Tom and Greg headed in opposite directions toward the
main body of the ship. Just as they broke up, they heard a muffled metallic sound from the nearest
compartment grill.
It was the clang-clang-clang of the orbit-ship's general alarm.
* * * * *
Crewmen stopped with food halfway to their mouths, jerked  away  from  tables.  Orders  buzzed
along  a  dozen  wires,  and  section  chiefs  began  reporting  their  battle-stations  alert  and  ready.
Finally Tawney snapped on the general public address system speaker. "Now get this," he roared.
"I want every inch of this ship searched ... every  corridor,  every  compartment.  I want  a  special
crew standing by for missile launching. I want double guards at every airlock. If  they  get  a  ship
away from here, the man who lets them through had better be dead when I find him...." He broke
off,  clutching  the  speaker  until  his  voice  was  under  control  again.  "All  right,  move.  They're
armed, but there's no place they can go. Find them."
A section-chief came back over the speaker. "Dead or alive, boss?"
"Alive, you idiot! At least the Hunter brat. I'll take the other one any way you can get him."
He switched off, and waited, pacing the control cabin like a caged animal. Ten minutes later a
buzzer sounded. "Hydroponics, boss. All clear."
"No sign of them?"
"Nothing."
Another buzz. "Number seven ore hold. Nothing here."
Still another buzz. "Crew's quarters. Nothing, boss."
One  by  one  the  reports  came  in.  Fuming,  Tawney  checked  off  the  sections,  watched  the  net
draw tighter throughout the ship. They were somewhere, they had to be....
But nobody seemed to find them.
He was  buzzing  for  his  first  mate  when  the  power  went  off.  The  lights  went  out,  the  speaker
went dead in his  hand.  The  computers  sighed  contentedly  and  stopped  computing.  Abruptly  the
emergency  circuits  went  into  operation,  flooding  the  darkness  with  harsh  white  lights.  The
intercom started buzzing again.
"Engine room, boss."

"What happened down there?" Tawney roared.
The man sounded like he'd just run the mile. "Generators," he panted. "Blown out."
"Well, get somebody in there to fix them. Have a crew seal off the area...."
"Can't, boss. Fix them, I mean."
"Why not? What have we got electricians for?"
"There's nothing left to fix. The generators aren't wrecked ... they're demolished...."
"Then get the pair that did it...."
"They're  not  here.  We've  been  sealed  up  tight.  There's  no  way  anybody  could  have  gotten  in
here...."
After that, things began to get confusing.
* * * * *
For  a  while  Merrill  Tawney  thought  that  his  crew  was  going  crazy  ...  and  then  he  began  to
wonder if he were the one who was losing his mind.
Whatever the case, Merrill Tawney was certain of one thing. The things that were happening on
his orbit-ship could not possibly be happening.
A guard in one of the outer shell storage holds called in with a disquieting report. Greg Hunter,
it seemed, had just been spotted vanishing into one of the  storage  compartments  from  the  main
outer-shell  corridor.  When  the  guard  had  broken  through  the  jammed  hatchway  to  collar  his
trapped victim, there was no sign of the victim anywhere around.
At the same moment, a report came in from a guard on the opposite side of the ship. He had just
spotted Greg Hunter there, it seemed, moving down a spur corridor. The guard had  held  his  fire
(according to Tawney's orders) and summoned help to corner the quarry ... but when help arrived,
the quarry had vanished.
* * * * *
Five minutes later the Hunter boy was discovered in the Hydroponics section, busily reducing all
the yeast vats to shambles with a  curious  weapon  that  seemed  to  eat  holes  in  things.  It  ate  the
deck out from under the guard's feet, sending him plunging through the floor into  the  galley.  By
the time he had scrambled back again, the Hunter boy was gone, and a rapid move to seal off the
region failed to turn him up again. The guard was  upset;  Tawney  was  a  great  deal  more  upset,
because  at  the  time  Greg  Hunter  was  (reportedly)  playing  havoc  with  the  yeast-vats  in
Hydroponics he was also (reportedly) knocking guards down like ten-pins in the main corridor off
the engine room while reinforcements tried to pin him down with a wide-beam stunner....
Quite  suddenly  emergency  circuits  closed  and  lights  flashed  in  the  control  cabin,  the  special
signal for a meteor-collision with the outer shell in No. 3  hold.  Tawney  signalled  for  the  section
chief frantically. "What's happening down there?"
"I can't talk," the section chief gasped. "Gotta get into a suit, we're leaking in here...."
"Well, plug up the hole!"
"The hole's four feet wide, sir!" There was a fit of coughing and the contact broke. The signals
for  No.  4  hold  and  No.  5  hold  were  flashing  now;  while  the  crew  members  in  the  vicinity
scrambled for pressure suits someone systematically proceeded to blow holes in No. 9, No. 10 and
No. 11 holds....
It was impossible. The reports came in thick and fast. Greg Hunter was in two places  at  once,
and  everywhere  he  went  ...  in  both  places  ...  there  was  a  trail  of  unbelievable  destruction.
Bulkheads demolished, gaping holes torn in the outer shell,  the  air-reconditioning  units  smashed
beyond repair.... Tawney buzzed for his first mate.
An emergency switch cut into the line, with the frantic voice of a section chief. Johnny Coombs

had  been  spotted  disappearing  into  the  ventilator  shaft  in  the  engine  sector.  "Well,  go  in  after
him!"  Tawney  screamed.  He  got  his  first  mate  finally,  and  snarled  orders  into  the  speaker.
"They're in the ventilators. Get a crew in there and stop them."
But it was dark in the ventilator shafts. No emergency lights in there. Worse, the crewmen were
hearing  the  things  that  were  being  whispered  around  the  ship.  The  ventilator  shafts  yawned
menacingly before them; they went in reluctantly. Once in the dark maze of tunnels, identification
was difficult. Two guards met each other headlong in the darkness, and put each other out of the
fight in a flurry of nervous stunner-fire. While they searched more of the holds were broken open,
leaking air through gaping rents in the hull....
Tawney felt the panic spreading; he tried to curb it, and it spread in spite of him. The fugitives
were appearing  and  disappearing  like  wraiths.  Reports  back  to  control  cabin  took  on  a  frantic
note, confused and garbled. Now the second-level bulkheads were being attacked. Over a third of
the compartments were leaking precious air into outer space.
When  a  terrified  section  chief  came  through  with  a  report  that  two  Greg  Hunters  had  been
spotted by the  same  man  at  the  same  time,  and  that  the  guards  in  the  sector  were  shooting  at
anything that moved, including other guards,  Tawney  made  his  way  to  the  radio  cabin  and  put
through a frantic signal to Jupiter Equilateral headquarters on Mars.
The  contact  took  forever,  even  with  the  ship's  powerful  emergency  boosters.  By  the  time
someone at headquarters was reading him, Tawney's report sounded confused. He was trying for
the  third  time  to  explain,  clearly  and  logically,  how  two  men  and  a  ghost  were  scuttling  his
orbit-ship under his very feet when one wall of the cabin vanished in a crackle of blue fire, and he
found himself staring at two Greg Hunters and a grim-faced Johnny Coombs.
He made  squeaky  noises  into  the  microphone  and  dropped  it  with  a  crash.  He  groped  for  a
chair; Johnny jerked him to his feet again. "A scout-ship," he said tersely. "Clear it for launching.
We want one with plenty of fuel, and we don't want a single guard anywhere near the airlock." He
picked up an  intercom  microphone  and  thrust  it  into  the  little  fat  man's  trembling  hand.  "Now
move! And you'd better be sure they understand you, because you're coming with us."
Merrill Tawney stared first at Tom, then at Greg, and finally at the microphone. Then he moved.
The orders he gave to his section chiefs were very clear and concise.
He had never argued with a ghost before, and he didn't care to start now.
* * * * *
It was over so quickly that it seemed to Tom it had just begun, and if so much had not been at
stake, it might have been fun.
It had been the gun ... the remarkable gun that Roger Hunter had left as his legacy ... that had
been  the  key.  It  ate  through  steel  and  aluminum  alloy  like  putty.  Whatever  its  power  source,
however it worked, by whatever means it had been built, there had been  no  match  for  it  on  the
orbit-ship.
It had worked ... and that was all that mattered right then.
With it, and with the advantage of a ghost that walked like a man ... Tom Hunter, to be exact ...
they  had  reduced  the  Jupiter  Equilateral  orbit-ship  to  a  smoking  wreck  in  something  less  than
thirty minutes.
The signal came back that a scout-ship was ready, unguarded. Johnny prodded Tawney with the
stunner. "You first," he said.
"But where are you taking me?"
"You'll see," Johnny said.
"It was a trick," Tawney said, glaring at Tom. "They told me they shot your ship to pieces...."
"The ship, yes," Tom said. "Not me."

"Well  ...  well,  that's  good,  that's  good,"  Tawney  said  quickly.  He  turned  to  Greg.  "You  don't
have to take me back ... the bargain is still good...."
"Move," Johnny Coombs said.
With Tawney between them, Greg and Tom marched down the corridor toward the airlock, with
Johnny bringing up the rear. No one stopped them. No one even came near them. One crewman
stumbled on them in the corridor; he saw Tawney with a gun in his back, and fled in terror.
They  found  the  scout-ship,  and  strapped  Tawney  down  to  an  accelleration  bunk,  binding  his
hands and feet so he couldn't move. Greg checked the controls  while  Tom  and  Johnny  strapped
down.  A  moment  later  the  engines  fired,  and  the  leaking  wreck  of  the  orbit-ship  fell  away,
dwindling and disappearing in the blackness of space.
It  was  a  quiet  journey.  The  red  dot  that  was  Mars  grew  larger  every  hour.  One  of  the  three
stayed awake at all times to watch Tawney while the others slept. During the second rest period,
Tom woke up while Greg was on duty.
"How's our prisoner doing?" Tom asked.
"No problem there, he can barely move. I almost wish he'd try something, he's too quiet."
It  was  true.  Tawney  had  recovered  from  his  shock  ...  but  rather  than  grow  more  worried  as
Mars grew large on the screen, he seemed  to  become  more  cheerful  by  the  minute.  "He  doesn't
seem very worried, does he?" Tom said.
"No, and it doesn't quite add. We've got enough on him to get Jupiter Equilateral pushed right
out of the Belt."
"I'd still feel better if we had the whole picture for the Major," Tom said. "We still don't know
what Dad found, or where he hid it...."
The  uneasiness  grew.  Tawney  ignored  them,  staring  at  the  image  of  the  red  planet  on  the
viewscreen almost eagerly. Then, eight hours out of Sun Lake City a U.N. Patrol ship appeared,
moving toward them swiftly. "Intercepting orbit," Greg  said.  "Looks  like  they  were  waiting  for
us."
They watched as the big ship moved  in  to  tangential  orbit,  matching  its  speed  to  theirs.  Then
Greg snapped the communicator switch. "Sound off," he said  cheerfully.  "We've  got  a  prize  for
you."
"Stand by, we're boarding you," the Patrol sent back. "And put your weapons aside."
Four scooters broke from the side of the Patrol ship. Greg activated the airlock. Five  minutes
later  a  man  in  Patrol  uniform  with  captain's  bars  stepped  into  the  control  cabin,  a  stunner  on
ready in his hand. Three Patrolmen came in behind him.
The captain looked around the cabin, then saw Tawney, and took a deep  breath.  "Well,  thank
the stars you're safe at any rate. Pete, Jimmy, take the controls."
"Hold on," Greg said. "We don't need a pilot."
The Captain looked at him. "Sorry, but we're taking you in. There won't be any  trouble  unless
you make it. You three are under arrest, and I'm authorized to make it stick if I have to. I suggest
you just cooperate."
They stared at him. Then Johnny said, "What are the charges?"
"You ought to know," the Captain said. "We have a formal complaint from the main offices of
Jupiter  Equilateral,  charging  you  with  piracy,  murder,  kidnapping  of  a  company  official,  and
totally wrecking a company orbit ship. I don't quite see how you managed it,  but  we're  going  to
find out in short order."
There was a stunned silence in the cabin, and then a sound came from the rear of the cabin.
Merrill Tawney was laughing.

12. The Sinister Bonanza
They were taken to a small, drab internment room. A half hour passed and  still  no  word  from
the Major. From the moment the Patrol  crew  had  boarded  them,  everything  had  seemed  like  a
bad dream. The shock of  the  arrest,  the  realization  that  the  Captain  had  been  serious  when  he
reeled off the charges lodged against them ... they had been certain it was some kind of ill-planned
joke  until  they  saw  the  delegation  of  Jupiter  Equilateral  officials  waiting  at  the  port  to  greet
Merrill Tawney like a man returned from the dead. They had watched Tawney climb into the sleek
company car and drive off toward the gate, while the Captain had escorted them without a word
down to the internment rooms.
The door clicked, and the Captain looked in. "All right, come along now," he said.
"Is the Major here?" Tom said.
"You'll see the Major soon enough." The Captain herded them into another room, where a clerk
efficiently fingerprinted them. Then they went down a ramp to a  jitney-platform,  and  boarded  a
U.N. official car. The trip into the city was slow; rush-hour traffic from the port was heavy. When
they  reached  U.N.  headquarters,  there  was  another  wait  in  an  upper  level  ante-room.  The
Captain stood stiffly with his hands behind his back and ignored them.
"Look, this is ridiculous," Greg burst out finally. "We haven't done anything. You haven't even
let us make a statement."
"Make your statement to the Major. It's his headache, not mine, I'm happy to say."
"But you let that man walk out of there scot free...."
The Captain looked at him. "If I were you," he said, "I'd stop complaining and start worrying. If
I had Jupiter Equilateral at my throat, I'd worry plenty, because once they start they don't stop."
A signal light blinked, and he  took  them  downstairs.  Major  Briarton  was  behind  his  desk;  his
eyes tired, his face grim. He dismissed the Captain, and motioned them  to  seats.  "All  right,  let's
have the story," he said, "and by the ten moons of Saturn it had better be convincing, because I've
about had my fill of you three."
He listened  without  interruption  as  Tom  told  the  story,  with  Greg  and  Johnny  adding  details
from  time  to  time.  Tom  told  him  everything,  from  the  moment  they  had  blasted  off  for  Roger
Hunter's claim to the moment the Patrol ship had boarded them, except for a single detail.
He didn't mention the remarkable gun from Roger Hunter's  gun  case.  The  gun  was  still  in  the
spacer's pack he had slung over his shoulder; he had  not  mentioned  it  when  the  Patrolmen  had
taken their stunners away. Now as he talked, he felt a twinge of guilt in not mentioning it....
But he had  a  reason.  Dad  had  died  to  keep  that  gun  secret.  It  seemed  only  right  to  keep  the
secret a little longer. When he came to the part about their weapons, he  simply  spoke  of  "Dad's
gun" and omitted any details.
And through the story, the Major listened intently, interrupting only occasionally, pulling at his
lip and scowling.
"So we decided that the best way to convince you that we had the evidence you wanted was to
bring Tawney back with us," Tom concluded.
"A brilliant maneuver," the Major said dryly. "A real stroke of genius."
"But then the Patrol ship intercepted us and told us we were under arrest. And when we landed,
they let Tawney drive off without even questioning him."
"The least we could do, under the circumstances," the Major said.
"Well, I'd like to know why," Greg broke in bitterly. "Why pick on us?  We've  just  been  telling
you...."
"Yes, yes, I heard every word of it," the Major sighed. "If you knew the trouble ... oh, what's the

use? I've spent the last three solid hours talking myself hoarse, throwing in every bit of authority I
could muster and jeopardizing my position as Coordinator here, for the  sole  purpose  of  keeping
you three idiots out of jail for a few hours."
"Jail!"
"That's what I said. The brig. The place they put people when they don't behave. You three are
sitting on a nice, big powder keg right now, and when it blows I don't know how much of you is
going to be left."
"Do you think we're lying?" Greg said.
"Do you know what you're charged with?" the Major snapped back.
"Some sort of nonsense about piracy...."
"Plus  kidnapping.  Plus  murder.  To  say  nothing  of  totally  disabling  a  seventeen-million-dollar
orbit-ship and placing the  lives  of  four  hundred  crewmen  in  jeopardy."  The  Major  picked  up  a
sheet of paper from his desk. "According to Merrill Tawney's statement, the three of you hijacked
a company  scout-ship  that  chanced  to  be  scouting  in  the  vicinity  of  your  father's  claim.  Your
attack was unprovoked and violent. Everybody on Mars knows you were convinced  that  Jupiter
Equilateral  was  responsible  for  your  father's  death."  He  looked  up.  "In  the  absence  of  any
evidence, I might add, although I did my best to tell you  that."  He  rattled  the  report-sheet.  "All
right. You took the scout-ship by force, with the pilot at gunpoint, and made him home in on  his
orbit-ship.  Then  you  proceeded  to  reduce  that  orbit-ship  to  a  leaking  wreck,  although  Tawney
tried to reason with you and even offered you amnesty if you would desist. By the time  the  crew
stopped shooting each other in the dark ... fifteen of them subsequently expired, it says here ... you
had stolen another  scout-ship  and  kidnapped  Tawney  for  the  purpose  of  extorting  a  confession
out  of  Jupiter  Equilateral,  threatening  him  with  torture  if  he  did  not  comply...."  The  Major
dropped the paper to the desk.
Johnny  Coombs  picked  it  up,  looked  at  it  owlishly,  and  put  it  back  again.  "Pretty  large
operation for three men, Major," he said.
The Major shrugged. "You were armed. That orbit-ship was registered as a commercial vessel.
It had no reason to expect a surprise attack, and had no way to defend itself."
"They were armed to the teeth," Greg said disgustedly. "Why don't you  send  somebody  out  to
look?"
"Oh, I could, but why waste the time and fuel? There wouldn't be any weapons aboard."
"Then how do they explain the fact that the Scavenger was  blown  to  bits  and  Dad's  orbit-ship
ripped apart from top to bottom?"
"Details," the Major  said.  "Mere  details.  I'm  sure  that  the  company's  lawyers  can  muddy  the
waters quite enough so that little details like that are overlooked. Particularly with a sympathetic
jury and a judge that plays along."
He stood up and ran his hand through his hair. "All right, granted I'm painting the worst picture
possible ... but I'm afraid that's the way it's going  to  be.  I believe  your  story,  don't  worry  about
that. I know why you went out there to the Belt and I can't really blame you, I suppose.  But  you
were asking for trouble, and that's what you got. Frankly, I am amazed that you ever returned to
Mars, and how you managed to make rubble of  an  orbit-ship  with  a  crew  of  four  hundred  men
trying to stop you is more than I can comprehend. But you did it. All right, fine. You were justified;
they  attacked  you,  held  you  prisoner,  threatened  you.  Fine.  They'd  have  cut  your  throats  in
another  few  hours,  perhaps.  Fine.  I  believe  you.  But  there's  one  big  question  that  you  can't
answer, and unless you can no court in the Solar System will listen to you."
"What question?" Tom said.
"The question of motives," the Major replied. "You had plenty of motive for doing what Tawney

says you did. But what motive did Jupiter Equilateral have, if your story is true?"
"They wanted to get what Dad found, out in the Belt."
"Ah, yes, that mysterious bonanza that Roger Hunter found. I was  afraid  that  was  what  you'd
say. And it's the reason that Jupiter Equilateral is going to win this fight, and you're going to lose
it."
"I don't think I understand," Tom said slowly.
"I mean that I'm going to have to testify against you," the Major said. "Because your father didn't
find a thing in the Asteroid Belt, and I happen to know it."
* * * * *
"It's been a war," the Major said later, "a dirty vicious war with no holds barred and no quarter
given. Not a shooting war, of course, nothing out in the open ... but a war just the same, with the
highest stakes of any war in history.
"It  didn't  look  like  a  war,  at  first,"  the  Major  went  on.  "Back  when  the  colonies  were  being
built,  nobody  really  believed  that  anything  of  value  would  come  of  them  ...  scientific  outposts,
perhaps,  places  for  laboratories  and  observatories,  not  much  more.  The  colonies  were  placed
under United Nations control. Nobody argued about it.
"And then things began to change. There was wealth out here ... and  opportunities  for  power.
With the  overpopulation  at  home,  Earth  was  looking  more  and  more  to  Mars  and  Venus  for  a
place to move ... not tiny colonies, but places for  millions  of  people.  And  as  Mars  grew,  Jupiter
Equilateral grew."
"But it was just a mining company," Tom said.
"At  first  it  was,  but  then  its  interests  began  to  expand.  The  company  accumulated  wealth,
unbelievable  wealth,  and  it  developed  many  friends.  Very  soon  it  had  friends  back  on  Earth
fighting for it, and the United Nations found itself fighting to stay on Mars."
"I don't see why," Tom said. "The company already has half the mining claims in the Belt...."
"They aren't interested in the mining," the  Major  said.  "They  have  a  much  longer-range  goal
than  that.  The  men  behind  Jupiter  Equilateral  are  looking  ahead.  They  know  that  someday
Earthmen are going to have to go to the stars for colonies ... it won't be a matter of choice after a
while, they'll have to go. Well, Jupiter Equilateral's terms are very simple. They're perfectly willing
to  let  the  United  Nations  control  things  on  Earth.  All  they  want  is  control  of  everything  else.
Mars, if they can drive us out. Venus too, if it ever proves up for  colonies.  And  if  they  can  gain
control of the ships that leave our Solar System for the stars, they can build an empire, and they
know it."
They were silent for  a  moment.  Then  Johnny  Coombs  said,  "Doesn't  anybody  on  Earth  know
about this?"
"There are some who know ... but they don't see the danger. They think of Jupiter Equilateral as
just another big company. So far U.N. control of Mars and Venus has  held  up,  even  though  the
pressure  on  the  legislators  back  on  Earth  has  been  getting  heavier  and  heavier.  Jupiter
Equilateral won the greatest fight in its history when they limited U.N. jurisdiction to Mars,  and
kept us out of the Belt. And now they hope to convince the lawmakers that we're incompetent to
administer the Martian colonies and keep peace out here. If they succeed, we'll be called home in
nothing flat; we've had to fight just to stay."
The Major spread his hands helplessly. "Like I said, it's been a war. Our only hope was to prove
that the company was using piracy and murder to gain control of the asteroids. We had to find a
way to smash the picture they've been painting of themselves back on Earth as a big, benevolent
organization interested only in the best for Earth colonists on the planets. We had to expose them
before  they  had  the  Earth  in  chains  ...  not  now,  maybe  not  even  a  century  from  now,  but

sometime, years from now, when the breakthrough to the stars comes and Earthmen discover that
if they want to leave Earth they have to pay toll...."
"They could never do that!" Greg protested.
"They're doing it, son. And they're winning. We  have  been  searching  desperately  for  a  way  to
fight back, and that was where your father came in. He could see the handwriting, he knew what
was happening. That was why he broke with the company and tried to organize a competing force
before it was too late. And it was why he died in the Belt. He knew I couldn't send  an  agent  out
there  without  unquestionable  evidence  of  major  crime  of  some  sort  or  another.  But  a  private
citizen could go out there, and if he happened to be working with the U.N. hand in glove, nobody
could do anything about it."
"Then Dad was a U.N. agent?"
"Oh, not officially. There's not a word in  the  records.  If  I were  forced  to  testify  under  oath,  I
would have to deny any connection. But unofficially, he went out there to lay a trap."
The Major told them then. It had been an incredible risk that Roger Hunter had taken, but the
decision  had  been  his.  The  plan  was  simple:  to  involve  Jupiter  Equilateral  in  a  case  of
claim-jumping  and  piracy  that  would  hold  up  in  court,  pressed  by  a  man  who  would  not  be
intimidated and could not be bought out. Roger Hunter had made a trip to the Belt and come back
with stories ... very carefully planted in just the right ears ...  of  a  fabulous  strike.  He  knew  that
Jupiter Equilateral had jumped a hundred rich claims in the past, forcing the independent miners
to agree, frightening them into silence or disposing of them with "accidents."
But this was one claim they were not going to jump. The U.N. cooperated, helping him  spread
the story of his Big Strike until they were certain that Jupiter  Equilateral  would  go  for  the  bait.
Then Roger Hunter had returned to the Belt, with a U.N. Patrol ship close by  in  case  he  needed
help.
"We thought it  would  be  enough,"  the  Major  said  unhappily.  "We  were  wrong,  of  course.  At
first nothing happened ... not a sign of a company ship, nothing. Your father contacted me finally.
He was ready to give up. Somehow they must have learned that it was a trap. But they  had  just
been  careful,  was  all.  They  waited  until  our  guard  was  down,  and  then  moved  in  fast  and  hit
hard."
He sank down in his seat behind the desk, regarding the Hunter twins sadly. "You know the rest.
Perhaps you can see now why I tried  to  keep  you  from  going  out  there.  There  was  no  proof  to
uncover and no bonanza lode for you to find. There never was a bonanza lode."
The twins looked at each other, and then at the Major. "Why didn't you tell us?" Greg said.
"Would you have listened? Would telling you have kept you from going out there? There was no
point to telling you, I knew you would have to find out for yourselves, however painfully. But what
I'm telling you now is the truth."
"As  far  as  it  goes,"  Tom  Hunter  said.  "But  if  this  is  really  the  truth,  there's  one  thing  that
doesn't fit into the picture."
Slowly Tom pulled the gun case from his pack and set it down on the Major's desk. "It doesn't
explain what Dad was doing with this."
13. Pinpoint in Space
Tom knew now that it was the right thing to do. There was no question, after the Major's story,
of what Dad had been doing out in the Belt at the time he had been killed. He had been doing  a
job that was more important  to  him  than  asteroid  mining  ...  but  he  had  found  something  more
important than his own life, and had no chance to send word of what he had found back to Major
Briarton on Mars. That had been the unforeseeable part of the trap.
But now, of course, the Major had to know.

The Mars Coordinator looked at the thing on the desk for a long moment before he reached out
to touch  it.  The  bright  metal  gleamed  in  the  light,  pale  gray,  lustrous.  The  Major  picked  it  up,
balanced it expertly in his hand, and a puzzled frown clouded his face. He examined it minutely.
"What is this thing?" he said.
"Suppose you tell us," Johnny Coombs said from across the room.
"It looks like a gun."
"That's what it is, all right."
"You've fired it?"
"Yes ... but I wouldn't fire it in here, if I were you," Johnny said. "You were wondering how we
wrecked  Tawney's  orbit-ship  so  thoroughly.  That's  your  answer  right  there."  He  told  about  the
hole in the bulkhead, the way the ship's generators had melted like clay under the powerful blast
of the weapon.
The Major could  hardly  control  his  excitement.  "Where  did  you  get  it?"  he  asked,  turning  to
Tom.
"From the space pack that you turned over to us. I didn't even look at it, until we needed a gun
in a hurry. I just assumed it was Dad's revolver."
"And  your  father  found  it  somewhere  in  the  Belt,"  the  Major  said  softly.  He  looked  at  the
weapon again, shaking his head. "There isn't any such gun," he said finally. "These things you say
it could do ... they would require energy enough to break down the cohesive forces of molecules.
There isn't any way we know of to harness that kind of energy and channel it in a hand weapon.
Nobody on Earth...."
He broke off and stared at them.
"That's right," Johnny said. "Nobody on Earth."
"You mean ... extraterrestrial?"
"There isn't any other answer," Johnny said. "Look at the thing, Major. Feel it. Does it feel like
it was made for a human  hand?  It  doesn't  fit,  it  doesn't  balance,  you  have  to  hold  it  with  both
hands to aim it...."
"But where  did it  come  from?"  the  Major  said.  "We've  never  had  visitors  from  another  star
system  ...  not  in  the  course  of  recorded  history.  And  we  know  that  Earthmen  are  the  only
intelligent creatures in our Solar System."
"You mean that they're the only ones now," Tom said.
"Or any other time."
"We don't know that, for sure," Tom said.
"Look, we've explored Venus, Mars, all the major satellites. If there had ever been intelligence
on any of them, we'd have known it."
"Maybe there was a planet that Earthmen haven't explored," Tom said. "Even Dad tried to tell
us that. The quotation from Kepler that he scribbled down in his log ... 'Between Jupiter and Mars
I will put a planet.' Why would Dad have written that? Unless he had suddenly discovered proof
that there had been a planet there?"
"You mean this ... this gun," the Major said.
"And whatever else he found."
"But there's never been any proof of that theory ... not even a hint of proof."
"Maybe Dad found proof. There are hundreds of thousands of asteroid  fragments  out  there  in
the Belt, and only a few hundred of them have ever been examined by men."
On the desk the strange weapon stared up at them.  Evidence,  mute  evidence,  and  yet  its  very

existence said more than a thousand words. It was there. It could not be denied.
And someone ... or something ... had made it.
Slowly the Major pulled himself  to  his  feet.  "It  must  have  happened  after  his  last  message  to
me," he said. "It wasn't part of the scheme we had set up, but he made a strike just the same ... an
archeological strike ... and this gun was part of it." He picked up the weapon, turned it over in his
hand.  "But  it  was  days  after  that  last  message  before  his  signal  went  off,  and  the  Patrol  ship
moved in."
"It makes sense," Johnny Coombs said. "He found the gun, and something more."
"Like what?"
"I wouldn't even guess," Johnny said. "A planet with a race of creatures intelligent enough and
advanced enough to make a weapon like that ... it could have been anything. But whatever it was,
it must have scared him. He must have known that a company ship might turn up any minute ... so
he hid whatever he had found, and all he dared to leave was a hint."
"And now it's vanished," the Major said. "The big flaw in the whole idea. My Patrol ship found
nothing when it searched the region. You looked,  and  drew  a  blank.  The  company  men  scoured
the area." He spread his hands helplessly. "You see, it just won't hold up, not a bit of it. Even with
this gun, it won't hold up. We've got to find the answer."
"It's out there somewhere," Tom said doggedly. "It's got to be."
"But where? Don't you see that everything hangs on that one thing? If we could prove that your
father found something just before he was killed, we could tear Jupiter Equilateral's case against
you into shreds. We could charge them with piracy and murder, and make it stick. We could break
their power once and for all ... but until we know what Roger Hunter found, we're helpless. They'll
take you three to court, and I won't be able to stop them. And if you lose that case, it may mean
the end of U.N. authority on Mars."
"Then  there's  just  one  thing  to  do,"  Johnny  Coombs  said.  "We've  got  to  find  Roger  Hunter's
bonanza."
* * * * *
It was almost midnight when they left the Major's office, a gloomy trio, walking silently up the
ramp to the Main Concourse, heading toward the living quarters.
They had been talking with the Major for hours, going over every facet of the story,  wracking
their brains for the answer ... but the answer had not come.
Roger Hunter had  found  something,  and  hidden  it  so  well  that  three  groups  of  searchers  had
failed to discover it. After seeing the gun, the Major was convinced that there had indeed been a
discovery made. But whatever that discovery had been, it was gone as if it had never existed ... as
if by  some  sort  of  magic  it  had  been  turned  invisible,  or  conjured  away  to  another  part  of  the
Solar System.
Finally, they had given up, at  least  for  the  moment.  "It  has  to  be  there,"  the  Major  had  said
wearily.  "It  hasn't  vanished,  or  miraculously  ceased  to  exist.  We  know  he  was  working  on  one
claim,  one  asteroid.  There  were  no  other  asteroids  in  the  region  ...  and  even  the  ones  within
suicide radius have been searched."
"It's there, all right," Tom said. "We're missing something, that's all."
"But what? Asteroids have stable orbits. Nobody can just make one disappear...."
They had called it a night, finally.
Once home they found more bad  news  waiting.  There  were  two  messages  on  the  recordomat.
The first was an official summons to appear before the United Nations Board of Investigations at
9:00 the following morning to answer "certain charges placed against the above named  persons
by  the  Governing  Board  of  Jupiter  Equilateral  Mining  Industries,  and  by  one  Merrill  Tawney,

plaintiff,  representing  said  Governing  Board."  They  listened  to  the  plastic  record  twice.  Then
Greg tossed it down the waste chute.
The other message was addressed to Greg, from the Commanding Officer of Project Star-Jump.
The message was very polite and regretful; it was also very firm. The pressure of the work there,
in  his  absence,  made  it  necessary  for  the  Project  to  suspend  Greg  on  an  indefinite  leave  of
absence. Application for reinstatement could be made at a later date, but acceptance could not be
guaranteed....
"Well,  I might  have  expected  it,"  Greg  said,  "after  what  the  Major  told  us.  The  money  for
Star-Jump  must  have  been  coming  from  somewhere,  and  now  we  know  where.  The  company
probably  figures  to  lay  claim  on  any  star-drive  that's  ever  developed."  He  dropped  the  notice
down the chute, and laughed. "I guess I really asked for it."
"You mean I pushed you into it," Tom said bitterly. "If I'd kept my big mouth shut  at  the  very
start of this thing, you'd have gone back to the Project and that would have been the end of it...."
* * * * *
Greg  looked  at  him.  "You  big  bum,  do  you  think  I really  care?"  He  grinned.  "Don't  feel  too
guilty, Twin. We've been back to back on this one."
He pulled off his shirt and walked into the shower room. Johnny Coombs was already stretched
out on the sofa, snoring softly.
Quite suddenly the room seemed hot and stuffy, oppressive. He couldn't make his thoughts come
straight. There had been too much thinking, too much speculation. Tom stood up and slipped on
his jacket.
He had to walk, to move about, to try to think. He  slipped  open  the  door,  and  started  for  the
ramp leading to the Main Concourse.
There was an answer, somewhere.
He walked on along the steel walkways, trying to clear his mind of the doubts and questions that
were plaguing him. At first he just wandered, but presently he realized that he had a destination in
mind.
He went up a ramp and across the lobby of the United Nations Administration Building. He took
a spur off the main corridor, and came to a doorway with a small circular staircase beyond it. At
the bottom of the stairs he opened a steel door and stepped into the Map Room.
It was a small darkened amphitheater,  with  a  curving  row  of  seats  along  one  wall.  On  either
side  were  film  viewers  and  micro-readers.  And  curving  around  on  the  far  wall,  like  a  huge
parabolic mirror, was the Map.
Tom  had  been  here  many  times  before,  and  always  he  gasped  in  wonder  when  he  saw  the
awesome beauty of the thing. Stepping into the Map Room was like stepping into the center of a
huge cathedral. Here was the glowing, moving panorama of the Solar System  spread  out  before
him in a breath-taking three-dimensional image. Standing here before the Map it seemed as if he
had suddenly become enormous and omnipotent, hanging suspended in the blackness of space and
staring down at the Solar System from a vantage point a million miles away.
Once, Dad had told him, there had been a great statue in the harbor of Old New York which had
been a symbol of freedom for strangers coming to that city from across the  sea,  and  a  welcome
for countrymen returning home. And someday, he knew, this view of the  Solar  System  would  be
waiting  to  greet  Earthmen  making  their  way  home  from  distant  stars.  The  Map  was  only  an
image, a gift from the United Nations to the colonists on Mars, but it reproduced the Solar System
in the minutest detail that astronomers could make possible.
In the center, glowing like a thing alive, was the Sun, the hub of the magnificent wheel. Around
it,  moving  constantly  in  their  orbits,  were  the  planets,  bright  points  of  light  on  the  velvet

blackness of the screen. Each orbit was computed and held on the screen by the great computer in
the vault below.
But there was more on the Map than the Sun and  the  planets,  with  their  satellites.  Tiny  green
lights marked the Earth-Mars and the Earth-Venus orbit-ships, moving slowly across the  screen.
Beyond Mars, a myriad of tiny lights projected on the screen, the asteroids. Without the magnifier
Tom could identify the larger ones ... Ceres, on the opposite side of the Sun from Mars now as it
moved in its orbit; smaller Juno, and Pallas, and Vesta....
For each asteroid which had been identified, and its orbit plotted, there was a pinpoint of light
on  the  screen.  For  all  its  beauty,  the  Map  had  a  very  useful  purpose  ...  the  registry  and
identification of asteroid claims among the miners of  Mars.  Each  asteroid  registered  as  a  claim
showed  up  as  a  red  pinpoint;  unclaimed  asteroids  were  white.  But  even  with  the  advances  of
modern astronomy only a small percentage of the existing asteroids were on the map, for the vast
majority had never been plotted.
Tom  moved  up  to  the  Map  and  activated  the  magnifier.  Carefully  he  focussed  down  on  the
section of the Asteroid Belt they had visited so recently. Dozens of pinpoints sprang to view, both
red and white, and beneath each red light the claim-number neatly registered. Tom peered at the
section, searching until he found the number of Roger Hunter's last claim.
It was quite by itself, not a part of an asteroid cluster. He stepped up the magnification, peered
at  it  closely.  There  were  a  dozen  other  pinpoints,  all  unclaimed,  within  a  ten-thousand-mile
radius....
But near it, nothing....
No hiding place.
And then, suddenly, he knew the answer. He stared at the Map, his heart pounding in his throat.
He  cut  the  magnification,  scanning  a  wide  area.  Then  he  widened  the  lens  still  further,  and
checked the coordinates at the bottom of the viewer.
He knew that he was right. He had to be right. But this was no wild dream, this was something
that could be proved beyond any question of error.
Across the room he picked up the phone to Map Control. It buzzed interminably; then a sleepy
voice answered.
"The Map," Tom managed to say. "It's recorded on time-lapse film, isn't it?"
"'Course it  is,"  the  sleepy  voice  said.  "Observatory  has  to  have  the  record.  One  frame  every
hour...."
"I've got to see some of the old film," Tom said.
"Now? It's three in the morning."
"I don't need the film itself, just project it for me. There's a reader here."
He gave the man the dates he wanted, Mars time. The man  broke  the  contact,  grumbling,  but
moments later one of the film-viewers sprang to life. The Map coordinates showed at the bottom
of the screen.
Tom stared at the filmed image ... the image of a segment  of  the  Asteroid  Belt  the  day  before
Roger Hunter had died.
It was there. When he had looked at the Map, he had seen a single red pinpoint of light, Roger
Hunter's asteroid, with nothing in the heavens anywhere near it.
But  on  the  film  image  taken  weeks  before  there  were  two  points  of  light.  One  was  red,  with
Roger Hunter's claim number beneath it. The other was white, so close to the first that even at full
magnification it was barely distinguishable.
But it was there.

Tom's  hands  were  trembling  with  excitement;  he  nearly  dropped  the  phone  receiver  as  he
punched the buttons to ring the apartment. Greg's face appeared on the screen, puffy with sleep.
"What's that? Thought you were in bed...."
"You've got to get down here," Tom said.
Greg blinked, waking up. "What's the matter? Where are you?"
"In the Map Room. Wake Johnny up and get down here. And try to get hold of the Major."
"You've found something," Greg said, excited now.
"I've found something," Tom said. "I've found where Dad hid his strike ... and I know how we
can find it! We've got the answer, Greg."
14. The Missing Asteroid
It had been a wild twelve hours since Tom Hunter's call to his  brother  from  the  Map  Room  in
Sun Lake City. The Major had arrived first, still buttoning his shirt and wiping sleep from his eyes.
Johnny and Greg came in on his heels. They had found Tom waiting for them, so excited he could
hardly keep his words straight.
He told them what he had found, and they wondered why they  had  not  thought  of  it  from  the
first moment. "We knew there had to be an answer," Tom said, "some place Dad could have used
for a hiding place, some place nobody would even think to look. Dad must have realized that he
didn't have much time. When he saw his chance, he took it."
And it was pure, lucky chance. Tom showed them the section of the Map he had examined, with
the pinpoint of light representing Roger Hunter's asteroid claim. Then the Map Control officer ...
much more alert when he saw Major Briarton ... brought an armload of films up and loaded them
into the projector. They stared at the screen, and saw the  two  pinpoints  of  light  where  one  was
now.
"What was the date of this?" the Major asked sharply.
"Two  days  before  Dad  died,"  Tom  said.  "There's  quite  a  distance  between  them  there  ...  but
watch. One frame for every hour. Watch what happens."
He began running the film, the  record  taken  from  the  Map  itself,  accurate  as  clockwork.  The
white dot was moving in toward the red dot at a forty-degree angle. For an instant  it  looked  as
though  the  two  were  colliding  ...  and  then  the  distance  between  them  began  to  widen  again.
Slowly, hour by hour, the white dot was moving away, off the screen altogether....
The  Major  looked  up  at  Tom  and  slammed  his  fist  on  the  chair-arm.  "By  the  ten  moons  of
Saturn...." he exploded, and then he was on his feet, shouting at the startled Map Control officer.
"Get me Martinson down here, and fast. Call the port on a scrambled line and tell them to stand
by  with  a  ship  on  emergency  call,  with  a  crack  interceptor  pilot  ready  to  go.  Then  get  me  the
plotted orbits of every eccentric asteroid  that's  crossed  Mars'  orbit  in  the  last  two  months.  And
double-A security on everything ... we don't want to let Tawney get wind of this...."
Later, while they waited, they went over it to make sure that nothing was missing. "No wonder
we couldn't spot it," the Major said. "We were looking for an asteroid in a standard orbit in the
Belt."
"But there wasn't any," Tom said. "Dad's rock was isolated, nowhere near any others. And we
were so busy thinking of the thousands of rocks in normal orbits between Mars and  Jupiter  that
we forgot that there are a few eccentric ones that just don't travel that way."
"Like this one." The Major stared at the screen. "A long, intersecting orbit.  It  must  swing  out
almost  to  Jupiter's  orbit  at  one  end,  and  come  clear  in  to  intersect  Earth's  orbit  at  the  other
end...."
"Which  means  that  it  cuts  right  through  the  Asteroid  Belt  and  on  out  again."  Tom  grinned.
"Dad must have seen it coming ... must have thought it was on collision course for a while. But he

also must have realized that if he could hide something on its surface as it came near, it would be
carried clear out of the Belt altogether in a few days' time."
"And if we can follow it up and intercept it...." The Major was on his feet, talking rapidly into
the  telephone.  Sleep  was  forgotten  now,  nothing  mattered  but  pinpointing  a  tiny  bit  of  rock
speeding  through  space.  Within  an  hour  the  asteroid  had  been  identified,  its  eccentric  orbit
plotted.  The  coordinates  were  taped  into  the  computers  of  the  waiting  Patrol  ship,  as  the
preparations for launching were made.
It could not be coincidence. Somewhere on the surface of that  tiny  planetoid  racing  in  toward
the Sun they knew they would find Roger Hunter's secret.
* * * * *
Below them, as they watched, the jagged surface of the asteroid drew closer.
It was not round ... it was far too tiny a bit of cosmic debris to have sufficient gravity to crush
down rocks and round off ragged corners. It was roughly oblong in shape, and one side was sheer
smooth rock surface. The other side was  rough,  bristling  with  jutting  rock.  More  than  anything
else  it  looked  like  a  ragged  mountain  top,  broken  off  at  the  peak  and  hurled  into  space  by  an
all-powerful hand.
Slowly  the  scout-ship  moved  closer,  braking  with  its  forward  jets.  The  pilot  was  expert.
Carefully and surely he aligned the ship with the rock in speed and direction. In the accelleration
cot Tom could feel only an occasional gentle tug as the power cut on and off.
Then the Lieutenant said, "I think we can make a landing now, Major."
"Fine. Take a scooter down first, and carry a guy line."
They unstrapped, and changed into pressure suits. In the airlock they waited until the Lieutenant
had touched the scooter down. Then Major Briarton nodded, and they clamped their belts to the
guy line.
One by one they leaped down toward the rock.
From a few miles out in space, the job of searching the surface had not appeared difficult. From
the rock itself, things  looked  very  different.  There  was  no  way,  from  the  surface,  to  scan  large
areas, and the surface was so rough that they had to take constant care not to damage their boots
or rip holes in their suits. There were hundreds of crevices and caves, half concealed by the loose
rock that crumbled under their feet as they moved.
They spread out from the scooter for an hour of fruitless searching. Tom spent most of the time
pulling his boots free of surface cracks and picking his way over heaps of  jagged  rock.  None  of
them  got  farther  than  a  hundred  yards  from  the  starting  place.  None  of  them  found  anything
remarkable.
"We could spend weeks covering it this  way,"  Greg  said  when  they  met  at  the  scooter  again.
"Why  don't  I  take  the  scooter  and  criss-cross  the  whole  surface  at  about  fifty  feet?  If  I  spot
anything, I'll yell."
It seemed like a good idea. Greg strapped himself into the scooter's saddle,  straddling  the  fuel
tanks, using the hand jet to guide himself as he lifted lightly off the surface. He disappeared over
the horizon of rock, then reappeared as he moved over the surface and back.
Tom and Johnny waited with the Major. Twenty minutes later Greg brought the tiny craft back
again. "It's no good," he said. "I've scanned the whole bright-side, came as close as I dared."
"No sign of anything?" Johnny said.
"Not a thing. The dark side looks like a sheer slab, from what my  lights  show.  If  we  only  had
some idea what we were looking for...."
"Maybe you weren't close enough," Tom said. "Why not drop each of us off to take a quarter of
the bright-side and work our way in?"

The others agreed. Tom waited until the Major and Johnny had been posted; then he hopped on
the  scooter  behind  Greg  and  dropped  off  almost  at  the  line  of  darkness,  where  the  sheer  slab
began. All of them had hoped that there might be a sign, something that Roger Hunter might have
left to mark his cache, but if there was one none of them spotted it. Tom checked with the others
by the radio in his helmet, and started moving back toward the center of the bright side.
An  hour  later  he  was  only  halfway  to  the  center,  and  he  was  nearly  exhausted.  At  a  dozen
different spots he thought he had found  a  promising  cleft  in  the  rock,  a  place  where  something
might have been concealed ... but exploration of the clefts proved fruitless.
And now his confidence began to fail. Supposing he had been wrong? They knew the rock had
passed very close to Roger Hunter's asteroid, the astronomical records proved that.  But  suppose
Dad had not used it as his hiding place at all? He pulled himself around another jagged rock shelf,
staring down at the rough asteroid surface beyond....
At the base of the rock shelf, something glinted in the sunlight. He leaped down, and thrust his
hand into a small crevice in the rock. His hand closed on a small metal object.
It was a gun. It felt well balanced, familiar in his hand ... the revolver Dad had always carried in
his gun case.
He had to let them know. He was just snapping the speaker  switch  when  he  heard  a  growl  of
static in his earphones, and then Greg's voice, high-pitched and excited. "Over here! I think  I've
found something!"
It  took  ten  minutes  of  scrambling  over  the  treacherous  surface  to  reach  Greg.  Tom  saw  his
brother tugging at a huge chunk of granite that was wedged into a crevice in the rock. Tom got
there just as the Major and Johnny topped a rise on the other side and hurried down to them.
The rock gave way, rolling aside, and Greg reached down into the crevice. Tom leaned over to
help him. Between them they lifted out the thing that had been wedged down beneath the boulder.
It was a metal cylinder, four feet long, two feet wide, and bluntly tapered at either  end.  In  the
sunlight it gleamed like polished silver, but they could see a hairline break in the metal encircling
the center portion.
They had found Roger Hunter's bonanza.
* * * * *
In the cabin of the scout-ship they broke the cylinder open into two perfect halves. It came apart
easily, a shell of paper-thin but remarkably strong metal, protecting the tightly packed contents.
There was no question what the cylinder was, even though there was nothing inside that looked
even  slightly  familiar  at  first  examination.  There  were  several  hundred  very  tiny  thin  discs  of
metal that fit on the spindle of a small instrument that was packed with them. There were spools
of  film,  thin  as  tissue  but  amazingly  strong.  Examined  against  the  light  in  the  cabin,  the  film
seemed to carry no image at all ... but there was another small machine that  accepted  the  loose
end  of  the  film,  and  a  series  of  lenses  that  glowed  brightly  with  no  apparent  source  of  power.
There was a thick block of shiny metal covered on one side with almost invisible scratches....
A time capsule, beyond doubt. A confusing treasure, at first glance, but  the  idea  was  perfectly
clear. A hard shell of metal protecting the records collected inside....
Against what? A planetary explosion? Some  sort  of cosmic disaster  that  had  blown a  planet  and  its
people into the fragments that now filled the Asteroid Belt?
At the bottom of the cylinder was a small tube  of  metal.  They  examined  it  carefully,  trying  to
guess  what  it  was  supposed  to  be.  At  the  bottom  was  a  tiny  stud.  When  they  pressed  it,  the
cylinder  began  to  expand  and  unfold,  layer  upon  layer  of  thin  glistening  metallic  material  that
spread out into a sheet that stretched halfway across the cabin.
They  stared  down  at  it.  The  metal  seemed  to  have  a  life  of  its  own,  glowing  and  glinting,

focussing light into pinpoints on its surface.
It was a map.
At one side,  a  glowing  ball  with  a  fiery  corona,  an  unmistakeable  symbol  that  any  intelligent
creature in the universe that was able to perceive it at all would recognize as a star. Around it, in
clearly marked orbits, ten planets. The third planet had a single satellite, the fourth two tiny ones.
The sixth eleven. The seventh planet had ten, and was encircled by glowing rings.
But the fifth planet was broken into four parts.
Beyond the tenth planet there was nothing across a vast expanse  of  the  map  ...  but  at  the  far
side was another star symbol, this one a double star with four planetary bodies.
They stared at  the  glowing  map,  speechless.  There  could  be  no  mistaking  the  meaning  of  the
thing that lay before them, marked in symbols that could mean only one thing to any intelligence
that could recognize stars and planets.
But in the center of the sheet was another symbol. It lay halfway between the two Solar Systems,
in the depths of  interstellar  space.  It  was  a  tiny  picture,  a  silvery  sliver  of  light,  but  it  too  was
unmistakeable.
It could be nothing else but a Starship.
* * * * *
Later, as they talked, they saw that the map had told each of them, individually, the same thing.
"They  had  a  star-drive,"  Tom  said.  "Whatever  kind  of  creatures  they  were,  and  whatever  the
disaster that threatened their planet, they had a star-drive to take them out of the Solar System to
another star."
"But why leave a record?" Greg wanted to know. "If nobody was here to use it...."
"Maybe  for  the  same  reason  that  Earthmen  bury  time  capsules  with  records  of  their
civilization," Major Briarton said. "I'd guess that the records here will tell, when they have been
studied  and  deciphered.  Perhaps  there  was  already  some  sign  of  intelligent  life  developing
elsewhere in the Solar System. Perhaps they hoped that some of their own people would survive.
But they had a star-drive, so some of them must have escaped. And with the record here...."
"We may be able to follow them," Greg said.
"If  we  can  decipher  the  record,"  Johnny  Coombs  said.  "But  we  don't  have  any  clue  to  their
language."
"Did you have any trouble understanding what the map had to say?" the Major said quietly.
"No...."
"I don't think the rest will be much more difficult.  They  were  intelligent  creatures.  The  record
will  be  understandable,  all  right."  He  started  to  fold  the  map  back  into  a  tube  again.  "Maybe
Roger Hunter tried to use the film projector. We'll never know. But he must have realized that he
had discovered the secret of a  star-drive.  He  realized  that  the  United  Nations  were  the  ones  to
explore it and use it, and he gave his life to keep it out of the hands of Tawney and his men...."
"A pity," a cold voice said close behind them, "that he didn't succeed, after all."
They whirled. In the hatchway to the after-cabin, Merrill Tawney was standing, with a smile on
his lips and a Markheim stunner trained directly on Major Briarton's chest.
15. The Final Move
"I realize I'm much earlier than you expected, Major. You did a very neat job of camouflaging
your takeoff ... we were almost fooled ... and no doubt the dummy ship you sent off later got full
fanfare.  I suppose  there  will  be  a  dozen  Patrol  ships  converging  on  this  spot  in  a  few  hours,
expecting to surprise a Jupiter Equilateral ship making a desperate  attempt  to  hijack  your  little
treasure here."

The  little  fat  man  laughed  cheerfully.  "Unfortunately  for  you,"  he  added,  "we  have  many
friends on Mars ... including a man in the Map room ... and I'm afraid your little trap isn't going to
work after all."
The Major's face was gray. "How did you get here?"
"By hitch-hiking. How else? Most uncomfortable, back there, even with a pile of pressure suits
for padding, but your pilot was really very skillful."
Johnny Coombs turned on the Major. "What does he mean, a trap? I don't get this...."
The  Major  sighed  wearily.  "I  had  to  try  to  force  his  hand.  Even  if  we  found  what  we  were
looking for, we had no case that could stand up against them. We needed proof ... and I thought
that with this as bait we could trap them. He's right about the Patrol  ships  ...  but  they  won't  be
near for hours."
"And that will be a little late to help," Tawney said pleasantly.
The Major glared at him. "Maybe so ... but you've gone too far this time. This is an official U.N.
ship. You'll never be able to go back to Mars."
"Really?"  the  fat  man  said.  "And  why  not?  Officially  I'm  on  Mars  right  now,  with  plenty  of
people to swear to the fact." He chuckled. "You seem to forget that little matter of proof, Major.
When your Patrol ships find a gutted ship and five corpses, they may suspect that something more
than an accident was involved, but what can they prove? Nothing more than they could prove in
the case of Roger Hunter's accident. Scout-ships have been known to explode before."
He ran his hand over the metal cylinder. "And as for this ... it's really a surprise. Of course when
we failed to find any evidence  of  mining  activity,  we  were  certain  that  Roger  Hunter's  bonanza
was something more than a vein of ore, but this! You can be certain that we will exploit the secret
of a star-drive to the very fullest."
"How do you think you can get away with it?" the Major said. "Turning up with something like
that right after a whole series of suspicious accidents in space?"
"Oh,  we  aren't  as  impatient  as  some  people.  We  wouldn't  be  so  foolish  as  to  break  the  news
now.  Five  years  from  now,  maybe  ten  years,  one  of  our  orbit-ships  will  happen  upon  a  silvery
capsule  on  one  of  our  asteroid  claims,  that's  all.  I  wouldn't  be  surprised  if  a  non-company
observer might be on board at the time, maybe even a visiting Senator from Earth. For something
this big, we can afford to be patient."
There was silence in the little scout-ship cabin. The end seemed inevitable. This was a desperate
move  on  Tawney's  part.  He  was  gambling  everything  on  it;  he  would  not  take  the  chance  of
letting any of them return to Mars or anywhere else to testify.
Greg caught Tom's eye, saw the hopelessness on his brother's face. He clenched his fists angrily
at  his  side.  If  it  were  not  for  Tom,  Dad's  bonanza  might  have  gone  on  circling  the  sun  for
centuries, maybe forever, wedged in its hiding place on the rocky surface of the eccentric asteroid.
But it had been found. Earth needed a star-drive badly; a few more years, and the need would
be  desperate.  And  if  a  group  of  power-hungry  men  could  control  a  star-drive  and  hold  it  for
profit, they could blackmail an entire planet for centuries, and build an empire in space that could
never be broken.
He knew that it must not happen that way. Dad had died to prevent it. Now it was up to them.
* * * * *
Greg glanced quickly around the cabin, searching for some way out, something that might give
them  a  chance.  His  eyes  stopped  on  the  control  panel,  and  he  sucked  in  his  breath,  his  heart
pounding. A possibility....
It would require  a  swift,  sure  move,  and  someone  to  help,  someone  with  fast  reflexes.  It  was
dangerous;  they  might  all  be  killed.  But  if  his  training  at  Star-jump  was  good  for  anything,  it

might work.
He caught Johnny Coombs' eye, winked cautiously. A frown creased Johnny's forehead. He shot
a quick look at Tawney, then lowered his eyelid a fraction of an inch. Greg could see the muscles
of his shoulders tightening.
Greg took quick stock of the cabin again. Then he took a deep breath and bellowed, "Johnny ...
duck_!"
Almost by reflex, Johnny Coombs hurled himself to  the floor.  Tawney swung the gun around.  There
was an ugly ripping sound as the stunner fired ... but Greg was moving by then. In two bounds he was at
the control panel. He hooked an arm around a shock bar, and slammed the drive switch on full.
There was a roar from below as the engines fired. Greg felt a jolt of pain as the accelleration jerked at
his arm. Tom and the Major were slammed back against a bulkhead, then fell in a heap on top of Johnny
and the Lieutenant as the awful force of the accelleration dragged them back. Across the cabin Tawney
sprawled on the floor. The stunner flew from his hand and crashed against the rear bulkhead.
On the panel Greg could see the accelleration gauge climbing swiftly ... past four g's, up to five, to six.
The ship was moving wildly; there was no pilot, no course.
With all the strength he could  muster Greg  tightened his arm on the shock  bar,  lifting his other  arm
slowly toward the cut-off switch. He had spent many hours in the accelleration centrifuge at Star-Jump,
learning to withstand and handle the enormous  forces  of accelleration  for brief periods,  but the needle
was still climbing and  he knew  he could  not hold on long. His fingers  touched  the  control  panel.  He
strained, inching them up toward the switch....
His fingers closed on the stud, and he pulled. The engine roar ceased. On the floor behind him Tawney
moved sluggishly, trying to sit up. Blood was dripping from his nose. He was still too  stunned  to  know
what had happened.
Greg leaped across the room, caught up the stunner, and then sank to the floor panting. "All right," he
said as his breath came back, "that's all. Your ship may have trouble finding us now ... but I bet our pilot
can get us back to Mars."
* * * * *
When they left the Sun Lake City infirmary it was almost noon,  and  the red  sun was  gleaming down
from  overhead.  Walking  slowly,  the  Hunter  twins  moved  along  the  surface  street  toward  the  U.N.
building.
"He'll recover without any trouble," the doctor had assured them. "He caught the stunner beam  in the
shoulder, and it will be a while before he can use it, but Johnny Coombs will be hard to keep down."
They had promised Johnny to return later. They had had check-ups themselves. Both Tom's eyes were
surrounded by purple splotches, and his broken left arm was in a sling. Greg's arms and legs were so stiff
he could hardly move them. The Major and the Lieutenant had been sore but uninjured.
Now the boys walked without talking. Already a U.N. linguist was at work on the record tapes from
the metal cylinder, and a mathematician was doing a preliminary survey on the math symbols on the metal
block.
"I hope there's no trouble reading them," Greg said.
"There won't be. It'll take time, but the records are decipherable. And Dr. Raymond was certain  that
the engineering can be figured out. Earth is going to get her star-ship, all right."
"And we've got work to do."
"You mean the trial? I guess. The Major says that Jupiter Equilateral is trying to pin the whole thing on
Tawney now. They won't get away with it, but it may be nasty just the same."
"Well, one thing's sure ... there'll be some changes made, with the U.N. moving out into the Belt," Greg
said.

Somewhere  in the distance  the twins heard  the rumble of engines. They stopped  and  watched  as  a
great silvery cargo ship lifted from the space port and headed up into the dark blue sky. They watched it
until it disappeared from sight.
They were both thinking the same thing.
An Earth-bound ship, powerful and beautiful, but limited now to  the sun and  nine planets,  unable to
reach farther out.
But someday soon a different kind of ship would rise.

1.F.
1.F.1.  Project  Gutenberg  volunteers  and  employees  expend  considerable  effort  to  identify,  do
copyright  research  on,  transcribe  and  proofread  public  domain  works  in  creating  the  Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, and the medium
on which they may be stored, may contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or
damaged disk or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.
1.F.2.  LIMITED  WARRANTY,  DISCLAIMER  OF  DAMAGES  -  Except  for  the  "Right  of
Replacement  or  Refund"  described  in  paragraph  1.F.3,  the  Project  Gutenberg  Literary  Archive
Foundation, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability to you for damages,  costs  and
expenses,  including  legal  fees.  YOU  AGREE  THAT  YOU  HAVE  NO  REMEDIES  FOR

POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
1.F.3.  LIMITED  RIGHT OF  REPLACEMENT  OR  REFUND  -  If  you  discover  a  defect  in  this
electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for
it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you received the work

on a physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation.  The person  or  entity
that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund. If
you received the work electronically, the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a
second  opportunity  to  receive  the work  electronically in  lieu  of  a  refund.  If  the  second  copy  is  also
defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem.

of certain types of damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of
the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer
or limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of
this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

this or  any Project  Gutenberg-tm  work,  (b)  alteration,  modification,  or  additions  or  deletions  to  any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable
by the widest  variety of computers  including obsolete,  old,  middle-aged  and  new computers.  It  exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.
Volunteers  and  financial  support  to  provide  volunteers  with  the  assistance  they  need,  is  critical  to
reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain
freely available for generations  to  come.  In 2001,  the Project  Gutenberg  Literary Archive Foundation
was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
Project  Gutenberg-tm  depends  upon  and  cannot  survive  without  wide  spread  public  support  and

donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can
be  freely distributed  in machine readable  form accessible  by  the  widest  array  of  equipment  including
outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to  maintaining tax
exempt status with the IRS.
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in
all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a  considerable
effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
donations  in  locations  where  we  have  not  received  written  confirmation  of  compliance.  To  SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit http://pglaf.org
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states  where  we  have not met the solicitation
requirements,  we  know  of no prohibition against accepting  unsolicited donations  from  donors  in  such
states who approach us with offers to donate.
International donations  are  gratefully accepted,  but we  cannot  make  any  statements  concerning  tax
treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
Please  check  the  Project  Gutenberg  Web  pages  for  current  donation  methods  and  addresses.
Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including including checks, online payments and credit
card donations. To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.
Professor  Michael  S.  Hart  is  the  originator  of  the  Project  Gutenberg-tm  concept  of  a  library  of
electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
Project  Gutenberg-tm  eBooks  are  often  created  from  several  printed  editions,  all  of  which  are
confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
http://www.gutenberg.net
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to  make  donations  to
the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
