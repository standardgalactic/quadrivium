Introduction
INTRODUCTION
During the past century, many Lebanese emigrants
have left home and sailed overseas looking for prosper-
ity and better life conditions.
In recent years, the emigration wave has reached the
point that more Lebanese are living abroad than in Leba-
non. They have integrated fully in their host countries
and played key roles in their new societies. Lebanon, de-
spite its small area and population, has become very well
known in the world. There is hardly any city that does
not have a Lebanese restaurant or a small Lebanese com-
munity. Many Lebanese have married outside their cul-
ture and adapted to a new life style, but others have dif-
ficulties integrating their spouses into their own culture
because of the language barrier. Many of us have experi-
enced the unpleasant handicap of being around people
who do not speak our language. In my immediate family,
my three foreign born sisters-in-law often felt alienated
when the conversation has shifted spontaneously into
Lebanese.
Therefore, I decided to put my many years of expe-
rience as a professor of foreign languages to the service
of my immediate family and my extended Lebanese fam-
ily by authoring a simple conversational book. My goal
is to help all those interested in learning the Lebanese
dialect reach a comfortable level of proficiency that will
provide them with basic survival skills and encourage
them to become active speakers rather than passive lis-
teners.
To reach this goal I rely on the following instructional
tools:

ii
Spoken Lebanese
a. A simple phonetic system
b. Short dialogues
c. Culture and Vocabulary Section
d. Grammar notes
e. Reinforcements
The phonetic system I adopted is a simplified adap-
tation of the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet). It is
intended to present the Arabic sounds in a contrastive way
with European sounds, limiting the memorization of pho-
netic symbols to just a few.
The short communicative exchanges are based on real
life situations and contain useful, high frequency vocabu-
lary.
The vocabulary and culture section presents the
learner with valuable cultural information in addition to
detailed explanatory notes for the communicative ex-
changes.
Since my goal is to teach the Lebanese Dialect which
is easily understood in Syria, Jordan, Palestine and other
parts of the Arab World, I will avoid elaborate grammar
notes related to MSA (Modern Standard Arabic) and I will
focus closely on verb conjugational patterns and pronomi-
nal suffixes.
My intentions are not to discourage anyone from
learning our beautiful Arabic Language. I am simply
offering a survival package to those interested only in
speaking our dialect.
Reinforcements will help the learner to go beyond
the material presented in the chapter and use words from
the supplementary list provided.
Since Lebanon lived many years under foreign occu-
pation, it should be no surprise to the learner to encoun-
ter many familiar words such as "Sandwich", "Balcon",
"Chauffeur" etc.... Lebanon has never opposed the inte-

gration of foreign words into its dialect. Those interested
in this topic may consult my work Lexicon ofForeign Words
in the Syrian-Lebanese Dialect,t. available at the Defense Lan-
guage Institute in Monterey, California, and at Appala-
chian State University, Boone, North Carolina. They may
also order it through the publisher of this book.
In conclusion, I hope that the learner find this work
rewarding. I strongly encourage anyone who is eager to
learn our beautiful dialect to seek the help of native speak-
ers, to be linguistically inquisitive and aggressive, and to
practice. Best wishes!

PHONETIC SYSTEM
In Modern Standard Arabic the phonological system
consists of 28 consonants and 6 vowels. More than half of
them are similar to English and are easy to pronounce.
Choosing a phonetic system for the Lebanese dialect
is a complicated task because many integrated foreign
words kept their original forms. Therefore I chose a simple
modified system adopted from the IPA to satisfy the needs
of our dialect without compromising the pronunciation
of foreign words. This system will be presented in a clear
wa~ in order to better help the learner who has no pho-
netic background. It is very important that you familiar-
ize yourself with this system and you master the sounds
before moving on to the first chapter.

CONSONANTS
(be) boy, rib.
(p) park, rope (the p is not an
Arabic con-
sonant).
(daal) door, bid.
(DaaD) This consonant is closely associated
with Arabic which is also called: the lan-
guage of DaaD. It is an emphatic velarized
correlative of "d". To pronounce this sound,
place the tip of the tongue against the up-
per teeth, stiffen the tongue and tighten the
muscles of your throat.
(te) tan, kit. Always dental.
(Tah) It is a voiceless alveolar stop, while
the plain f tf is a dental stop. The tongue
should be slightly retracted and raised to-
wards the soft palate.
(jiim) girafe, Asia.
(g) go, bag (The g is not an Arabic conso-
nant, but it is present in the Egyptian dia-
lect.)
(kaaf) kilo, cup, back

(Gayn) similar to the Parisian "r", the back
of the tongue should be slightly raised to-
wards the roof of the mouth as if you are
gargling. The front of the tongue should re-
main tight and low. The stream of air will
cause the vibration of the vocal cords.
(hamza) air, on. It is a glottal stop that may
occur in the beginning, in the middle or at
the end of a word. In English, it occurs in
monosyllable words, or in words that be-
gin with a vowel followed generally by two
consonants as in "absence, orbit".
In cer-
tain areas, people use it instead of / t / in
the middle of a word as in "mutton". It is
produced by closing and quickly opening
the vocal cords.
(Qaaf) This sound is heard in some Leba-
nese areas namely the Shouf Mountains and
the Bekaa Valley. It has been replaced by a
glottal stop ( , ) or Hamza in all other areas.
It surfaces however in certain words where
the glottal stop is closely followed by the
Qaaf, like in "anaaQa" (elegance); or
"ayQuune" (icon).
It is a guttural "kaaf"
produced from the back of the mouth. The
back of the tongue should touch the uvular
area, while the front part remains closely
tight to the bottom of the mouth. Similar to
"cough, call".
(laam) lemon, mile; it is a non-velarized
sound.

by applying the tip of the tongue against
the lower teeth while the back of the
tongue is pressing against the velum,
forcing the air to go through the tongue
and the alveolar ridge.

less velar and fricative sound. It is pro-
duced by narrowing the passageway
between the back of the tongue and the
velum. The front of the tongue remains
low. During the passage of air, the vo-
cal cords are not vibrated.
(9ayn) This consonant, like the /D/, I
T/, I G I, I QI, I SI, / HI, and the
Ixl has no English equivalent.
It is a
voiced pharyngeal and fricative sound.
It is produced by tightening the muscles
of the throat and expulsing the breath
through the vibrating vocal cords.
(waaw)
water, vow.
It is also a diph-
thong when preceded by / al as in
Itawml "twins".

yes, say, oyster.
It is also a diph-
thong when preceded by I aI as in
Ibayt/ "house".

Spoken Lebanese
Intonations and accents may vary from one Leba-
nese region to another, therefore the pronunciation
of certain words may differ from the way they are
phonetically transcribed in this book, e.g. Ibaytl
"house" may be said Ibeyt/; I anal "me, I" may be
said I anel in some areas; IlayfI "why" may be said
I leyI, and the pronoun suffix I i I may be pro-
nounced I eI or a sound in between I iI and I eI etc...
While this may cause some listening comprehension
difficulties, it should not affect the speaking compe-
tency of the learner.
Consonants are divided into "lunar" and "solar"
depending on their behavior with the letter III of
the definite article "al". The III remains with words
beginning with a lunar consonants, e.g. "albayt"
meaning: the house; it disappears with words begin-
ning with solar consonants, leading to the doubling
of that consonant, e.g. "affams" meaning: the sun.
This is the reason why you may see two similar con-
secutive consonants in the communicative exchanges
presented in this book.
The transition between a
word followed by another word that begins with a
solar consonant is made easy sometimes by insert-
ing a transitional vowel such as I a I, I ii, I u I, or
I eI, e.g. "bayt e ffa9b" meaning: the people's house;
"ra'iis e ddawle" meaning the president of the state.
All dental and palatal consonants are solar, with
the exception of I j I and I y I which are lunar. In the
Lebanese dialect the list of solar consonants is shorter
than the list of MSA because certain consonants like
j I thI as in "those" and
~ I thI as in "earth" are
absent.
The followings are the solar consonants in
the Lebanese dialect:
Itl, ITI, Idl, ID/, Irl, Izl, IZ/, lsi, lSI,
IfI, Ill, In/.

(ahlan) is an expression used to welcome someone, or to
answer someone's greeting. It means literally: you are
among your family.
(kiif) is an interrogative meaning "how". Verb "to be" is
implied in pronouns or pronominal suffixes like ik, ak,
etc.... Therefore (kiifak) means: how are you, mascu-
line, singular.
(inti) is a feminine singular pronoun.

CULTURE &
VOCABULARY
It is customary in Lebanon that when you pass by
someone's house to be invited in. The expression "tfaDDal"
follows automatically the greeting. If you are visiting with
someone, you have to adhere to the following cultural
norms:
• Do not put your feet on the coffee table or in any
position facing other people.

Chapter Two' Socializing & Family Members
9
• Do not help yourself to anything at the coffee table
unless you are invited to.
• Do not ask for sodas or drinks, your host will offer
you what is available in the house.
• When you meet someone for the first time, please
use the expression "tfarrafna" which means "I am hon-
ored to meet you".
• If another guest or a family member walks in or
out of the living room, please stand up to greet him or to
say "good bye" to him. It is rather rude to remain seated
unless you are asked to do so.
• When requesting something from your host, please
use one of the following expressions: "please", "9mul
ma9ruuf" do me a favor, "min faDlak" if you please.
• If you decide to stand up and leave, or you would
like to be excused for a moment, please use the expres-
sion "bil'izn" with your permission.
xeelti:
9ayni:
tfaDDal:
my maternal aunt. xeele, maternal aunt. It
looses the leI and takes a ItI before the
pronominal suffix to avoid the collision
of the two vowels.
my eye. Some people, especially the older
ones use terms of endearement when
talking to their relatives or to the younger
ones. You may hear "ya
f albi" my heart,
"ya ruuHi" my soul, etc... .
come in, lit. be generous. Imp. of tfaDDal.

ma9:
prep. with.
saleeme:
safety. ma9-ssaleeme: good bye, lit. go
with safety.
I albi:
my heart.
The hyphen that connects the two words marks the
absence of the definite article "al", and the doubling of
the initial consonant as seen in the phonetic remarks. It
indicates that the two words should be pronounced as
one. This will prevent glottal stops and mispronuncia-
tions.

GRAMMAR NOTES
In Arabic, the third masc. sing. form of the perfect
tense is the root of the verb; e.g. "Jirib" he drank, is the
root of verb to drink; "daras" he studied, is the root of
verb to study. In the Vocab. notes, the root will be given
after the tense.
Verbs in Arabic are commonly divided into triliteral
(three letters) and quadriliteral (four letters) verbs. There
are very few exceptions to that rule.
The triliteral verbs are divided into ten Measures
according to their pattern of conjugation. Quadriliteral
verbs have only two common measures.
If the root of a triliteral verb has a IwIor a IyI in
the beginning, the verb is called: Assimilated, e.g. wa9ad:
to promise.
If the root of a triliteral verb has a vowel in the
middle, the verb is called: Hollow, e.g. neem: to sleep;
raaH: to leave, to go.
If the root of the triliteral verb ends with a vowel,
the verb is called Defective; e.g. bi'i: to stay, to last; nisi:
to forget.
The most frequent verbs are Measure I verbs which
have a simple and predictable pattern of conjugation in
the Perfect and Imperfect tenses and in the Imperative.
The other most common measures are: Measure II
which causes generally someone to do something; Mea-
sure III which adds a meaning of reciprocity to Measure
I; Measure V which causes the verb to be reflexive; Mea-
sure VII which adds passivity to the verb; Measure IX as-
sociated mainly with colors; and Measure X which often
adds reflexivity or inquisition to the meaning of the verb.
The following is the conjugation of verbs you have
seen in this chapter:

verb, it takes a fbI in the beginning (except with niHna

order to buy stamps, mail a letter, send a package, or even
make a long distance or an overseas call, if there is no
phone center (santraal) available in your area.

CULTURE & VOCABULARY
There are two major railroads in Lebanon. One connects
Beirut to North and South Lebanon, the other connects Beirut
to Damascus, Syria. Several years ago the railroads were
used for the transportation of passengers and goods. Now
heavy trucks are slowly replacing the obsolete railroad sys-
tem for the freight of merchandise, and people rely on buses
and cars for ground transportations.
Within Beirut and its suburbs, people have a choice be-
tween buses, taxis, or "services".
The big buses are operated by the government. One
could also find some small individually owned and oper-
ated buses that serve a certain area.
Taxis are available allover Lebanon and they will take
you anywhere you like for an agreed-upon fee. Theyoper-
ate through an office.
"Services" are individually owned vehicles, licenced by
the government and used to take passengers from one sta-
tion to another city or town for a fixed fare. Five passengers

Beirut to the North and the South, it is a coastal highway
along the Mediterranean Sea; the other links Beirut to Dam-

CULTURE & VOCABULARY
Although fast food restaurants like Pizza Hut and Ken-
tucky Fried Chiken are becoming increasingly popular in
Lebanon, traditional restaurants are still very attractive. One
should count at least two hours for lunch and three hours
for dinner in a gourmet restaurant.
Since it is not customary to go out for breakfast, people
settle instead for a croissant, a thyme pie (man'uufi), a quick
sandwich, or (ka9kit kneefe) a cheese based pastry stuffed
in sesame seed bread.
Lunch and dinner begin with appetizers (meeza) fol-
lowed by the main course which is usually grilled meat or

76
Spoken Lebanese
poultry, game or fish, then fruits and pastry. Coffee is served
at the end of the meal. Despite the fact that many people
are becoming aware of the dangers of tobacco, smoking is
not forbidden in restaurants. Some people take a cigarette
break during their meal, others enjoy smoking a water pipe
(argiile). You may discreetly ask your waiter to seat you
away from smokers.

ardous. One has to be very careful because roads are very
congested and the speed limit is not always respected.

CULTURE & VOCABULARY
It is not unusual for friends and family members to
drop by and say Hi without calling ahead of time. It is
recommended however to notify people or to call them
before visiting with them.
Because Lebanon is a very small country (about 4015
square miles), land and housing are very expensive. The
cost of living is also very high. This may be the reason
why most people have difficulties buying and furnishing
their new homes. Single homes are becoming very scarce
in large cities and even in villages. People prefer to build
apartments or large condominiums on their land and
profit from their sale or rent.

As we saw in Chapter IX, accidents are frequent in

144
Spoken Lebanese
Lebanon due to the overwhelming number of cars in the
streets. When an accident occurs, it is important to calIon

write a report on the accident. This report will be used by
insurance companies and law enforcement officials to es-
tablish responsibilities. Every insurance company will pro-
vide you with a list of sworn experts.

GRAMMAR NOTES
Several expressions like ba9d, daxl, hay'a, ka'an, layk,
leezim, yaHHu, etc...behave as incomplete verbs when con-
nected to some pronominal suffixes. Some of them convey
the imperative meaning; others the demonstrative, or the
interpellation.
Although we have covered some of these expressions
in previous chapters, it is useful to compare their meaning
and their conjugational patterns.

APPENDIX
In this appendix you will find an extended list of the
vocabulary related to all the topics presented in this book.
This may help those who do not have the time to learn all
the components included in it, and those who only need
certain words to survive on a short trip. It is important
however to study the phonetic system in the beginning
of the book in order to pronounce the vocabulary cor-
rectly. This Appendix can be an excellent addendum to
any travel guide book on Lebanon.
Chapter One: Greetings & Formalities
FORMAL GREETINGS
In the morning: SabaaH-lxayr
In the evening: masa-Ixayr

Appendix
169
Greetings are usually followed by common courtesy
questions, e.g. (kifak) How are you? (kiif-IHaal) How is it
going? etc.... Middle Easterns always thank (*alla) God
for their well being.
*samiir:
*salwa:
*samiir:
*salwa:
marhaba ya *salwa
ahlan *samiir, kiifak?
IHamdilla, kiifik inti?
nufkur *alla meefe-IHaal
(ahlan) is an expression used to welcome someone, or to
answer someone's greeting. It means literally: you are
among your family.
(kiif) is an interrogative meaning "how". Verb "to be" is
implied in pronouns or pronominal suffixes like ike ak,
etc... (kiifak) means: how are you, masculine, singular.

170
Spoken Lebanese
(inti) is a feminine singular pronoun.
Please note that in the leb. dialect the feme pI. prone
and pronominal suffixes are replaced by the masc. pI. prone
and pronominal suffixes. The dual prone are replaced by
the masc. pI. pronouns. In all examples of the explana-
tory notes, I used the masc. sing. form.
PRONOUNS
he, him
she, her
they, them
you (masc. sing.)
you (fem. sing.)
you (mase. & feme pI.)
I, me
we, us
PRONOMINAL SUFFIXES
huwwe
hiyyi
hinni
inta
inti
intu
ana
niHna
When pronominal suffixes are added to a noun they
indicate possession, e.g. baytak (your home, masc. sing.),
ismak (your name, masc. sing.); when added to a verb they
are considered direct or indirect objects of that verb. e.g.
feefak (he saw you).
