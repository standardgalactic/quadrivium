Classes are Callable
When we create a class using the class keyword
Python automatically adds behaviors to the class
in particular:
à it adds something to make the class callable
à the return value of that callable is an object
à the type of that object is the class object
we say the object is an instance of 
the class
my_obj = MyClass()
type(my_obj) à MyClass
isinstance(my_obj, MyClass)
à True
also called class instantiation
or instantiating the class

Instantiating Classes
When we call a class, a class instance object is created
This class instance object has its own namespace
à distinct from the namespace of the class that was used to create the object
This object has some attributes Python automatically implements for us:
à __class__ tells us which class was used to instantiate the object
à __dict__ is the object's local namespace
à prefer using type(obj) instead of obj.__class__
