About the Author
Rod Powers joined the Air Force in 1975 intending to become a spy. He was devastated to
learn that he should’ve joined the CIA instead, because the military services don’t have that
particular enlisted job. Regardless, he fell in love with the military and made it both a pas-
sion and a career, retiring with 23 years of service. Rod spent 11 of those years as an Air
Force first sergeant, helping to solve the problems of the enlisted corps.
Since his retirement from the military in 1998, Rod has become a world-renowned military
careers expert. Through his highly popular U.S. Military Information Web site on About.com
(http://usmilitary.about.com), Rod has advised thousands of troops about all aspects
of U.S. armed forces career information. This is Rod’s fourth military book. Two of his previ-
ous books, ASVAB For Dummies and Veteran Benefits For Dummies, were published by Wiley.
Rod is the proud father of twin girls, both of whom are enjoying successful careers in the Air
Force. He currently resides in Daytona Beach, Florida, where he is attempting to prove that
there is no such thing as too much sunshine.
Even today, Rod tries to run his life according to long-lived military ideals and standards, but
he gets a bit confused about why nobody will obey his orders anymore.


Dedication
To Maloni, the love of my life, and the best granddaughter a granddaddy could ever hope for.

ASVAB AFQT For Dummies 

Introduction
B
ecause you’re reading this book, there’s a very good chance that you’re interested in
joining the U.S. military. I say that because the military recruiting commands are the
only people in the entire world who care about the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT)
score. The AFQT score is derived from four of the nine Armed Services Vocational Aptitude
Battery (ASVAB) subtests. It’s used to determine your overall qualification to join the mili-
tary branch of your choice.
Perhaps you’ve read my best-selling ASVAB For Dummies, or some other ASVAB prep book,
and you want more practice so that you can achieve the highest possible AFQT score. Maybe
you’ve already taken the ASVAB, you want to retest for a higher AFQT score, and you’re look-
ing for an advantage. In either case, you’ve chosen the right book!
Ever since ASVAB For Dummies hit the bookshelves, I’ve received hundreds of e-mails from
readers, asking for ways to score higher on the AFQT portion of the ASVAB. That’s why I
decided to write this book. Although the entire ASVAB is important in order to qualify for the
military job you want, the four subtests that make up the AFQT score are ultra-important,
because the AFQT score determines whether you can even get into the military.
Long gone are the days when someone could just walk into a recruiter’s office and get into the
military as long as he had a pulse. Today’s all-volunteer military members are the cream of the
crop. For example, did you know that, under current regulations, you need a minimum of a high
school education to join, and that no more than 10 percent of all recruits can have a GED?
Something else you may not know: The military services can’t just grow to whatever size
they want. Like any other government agency, they have a budget, and they have to operate
within that budget. Every year, when Congress passes the annual Defense Authorization Act,
it tells each military branch how many members it’s allowed to have at any given time. By
law, the services can’t go over the size mandated by our congressional leaders (who hold the
military purse strings).
Did you also know that, of every ten people who walk into a military recruiter’s office, only
three ultimately are allowed to enlist? Sure, some are disqualified because of medical history
or criminal history, but many are turned away because their AFQT scores are too low, or
because other qualified applicants have higher AFQT scores.
Today’s military is high tech. Even the “common” infantry soldier has to learn how to use
and maintain complicated electronic gadgets in order to survive on today’s battlefield. The
services use the AFQT to determine whether someone is “trainable” in the new, high-tech
military.
About This Book
Full-disclosure doctrine requires me to inform you that much of the information in this book
can be found in ASVAB For Dummies. The AFQT is, after all, part of the ASVAB, and I wouldn’t
cheat you by putting part of the information in one book and part of the information in
another.

So, why should you spend some of your hard-earned money on this book, particularly if
you’ve already bought ASVAB For Dummies? Because here you find expanded, more-detailed
information about the AFQT and the four subtests that make up the AFQT score. If you’re
worried about your AFQT score, I guarantee this book will help you get the highest score
possible.
Even if you’re not worried about your AFQT score, this book contains four — count ’em, four! —
additional practice tests for the four most important subtests of the ASVAB. Extra practice is
never a bad thing, as my high school football coach was fond of saying.
Conventions Used in This Book
I don’t use many special conventions in this book:
 Whenever I use a new term, I italicize the term and define it nearby, often in parentheses.
 I put Web addresses and e-mail addresses in monofont, so that you can easily distin-
guish them from the surrounding text.
When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to break across two
lines of text. If that happened, rest assured that I haven’t put in any extra characters (such as
hyphens) to indicate the break. So, when using one of these Web addresses, just type in
exactly what you see in this book, pretending as though the line break doesn’t exist.
What You’re Not to Read
This book has a few sidebars (shaded gray boxes) sprinkled throughout. They’re full of inter-
esting information about topics described in those chapters, but you don’t have to read
them if you don’t want to — they don’t contain anything you must know about the AFQT,
so if you’re in a hurry, you can skip them.
You can also skip anything marked with a Technical Stuff icon. (For more on icons, see “Icons
Used in This Book,” later in this Introduction.)
Foolish Assumptions
While writing this book, I made a few assumptions about you — namely, who you are and
why you picked up this book. I assume the following:
 You aren’t a dummy. You just want information to help you get the highest AFQT score
possible.
 You’re a high school graduate, or have a GED or at least 15 college credits. You just want
to brush up on your high school math and/or English skills, as they apply to the AFQT.
(If you aren’t a high school graduate, or you don’t have a GED or at least 15 college credits,
you need to get back to school, because you’re not eligible to enlist in the military.)
 You want to join the U.S. military and want to take advantage of all the enlistment
goodies, such as enlistment bonuses, that are available. Depending on current
recruiting needs, the services often tie enlistment incentives, such as bonuses or addi-
tional education benefits, to high AFQT scores.

ASVAB AFQT For Dummies 

How This Book Is Organized
There is a method to my madness — a reason why this book is organized the way you see it
today. I’ve organized this book according to subject matter. Information relating to commu-
nicative skills is located in one part, math skills are grouped in another part, and so on.
Here’s what I cover in each part.
Part I: Taking the AFQT Tour
Part I presents you with an overview of the AFQT and explains which of the four ASVAB sub-
tests are used to compute your AFQT score. You also learn how the score is computed, the
minimum score required to join each military branch, and how you can request a retest if
your score is too low.
For your added reading enjoyment, I also include a chapter with advice for getting the most
out of your study time and maximizing your AFQT score.
Part II: English as a First Language
If you already know that you need help on a particular language-related subtest, turn to
Part II where I show you how to pump up your vocabulary and reading comprehension skills,
two important ASVAB subtests that contribute to your AFQT score.
Part III: Calculating Better Math Knowledge
If you feel comfortable about your Word Knowledge and Paragraph Comprehension skills but
you know that you’re far from a math whiz, flip straight to Part III to start boning up on math
concepts. In this part, you also find some tips and techniques for deciphering those tricky
math word problems.
Part IV: AFQT Practice Exams
Most AFQT preparation books give you two or three practice tests. Here you get four full-
length AFQT practice exams! If you want to get a feel for the test and figure out what areas
you need to brush up on, turn to Part IV and take the first full-length practice test. After you
take the test and check your answers, you can determine which subtests are a piece of cake
for you and where you need help. Taking this approach lets you tailor a study plan to your
individual needs. (Even if you don’t have a lot of time for studying, taking the practice tests
will help you prepare for the exam.)
Part V: The Part of Tens
This is a For Dummies book, so it wouldn’t be complete without a Part of Tens. If you want to
get right down to it and find out some of the most important information for doing well on
the AFQT, and you like your info presented in easily digestible lists, turn to Part V. This part
gives you test-taking tips and directs you to additional resources if you need them.

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book you find icons — little pictures in the margins — that help you use the
material in this book to your best advantage. Here’s a rundown of what they mean to you:
The Tip icon alerts you to helpful hints regarding the subject at hand. Tips can help you save
time and help you score higher on the AFQT.
The Remember icon reminds you of important information you should read carefully.
The Warning icon flags information that may prove hazardous to your plans of acing the
AFQT. Often, this icon accompanies common mistakes people make when taking the test or
qualifying for enlistment. Pay special attention to the Warning icon so you don’t fall into one
of these pitfalls.
The Example icon points out sample questions that appear in the review chapters.
The Technical Stuff icon points out information that’s interesting, enlightening, or in depth
but that isn’t necessary for you to read. You don’t need this information to maximize your
AFQT score, but knowing it may make you a better informed test taker — or at least help you
impress your friends!
Where to Go from Here
You don’t have to read this book from cover to cover in order to maximize your AFQT score.
You may want to brush up on word problems but already know that you’ll ace the Paragraph
Comprehension subtest. If so, head to Chapters 10 and 11, but skip Chapters 6 and 7.
If you decide to skip around, look over the table of contents and choose which topics you’re
interested in.
You may want to jump straight to Chapter 12 and take the first AFQT practice exam — that
way, you can get an idea of what subjects you need to study more. Early on in your reading
of the book, check out Chapter 2, which provides invaluable information regarding how the
AFQT score is computed and how the score applies to military enlistment.
No matter where you start, I wish you all the best in your future military endeavors. I enjoyed
every single second of my 23-year military career, and I’m confident you’ll enjoy your time in
the military as well.

ASVAB AFQT For Dummies

Taking the AFQT Tour

In this part . . .
T
o score well on the AFQT, you need to know what it’s
about, and that’s why I’m here. Believe me — you do
want to do well on the AFQT portion of the ASVAB. The
score you earn on the AFQT determines whether you can
join the military service branch of your choice. Each of the
services has a different minimum standard. Depending on
their current recruiting needs, some of the services may
even use the AFQT score to determine what kind of enlist-
ment bonuses and incentives you may qualify for.
Even if you can’t control yourself and you want to jump
right in by reviewing the principles of algebra and memo-
rizing word lists, chill out and take a few minutes to read
through Part I. This part gives you an overview of the
AFQT, tells you how the score is derived, and lets you know
under what circumstances you can request a retest. I also
give you tips on getting the best possible score. Armed
with the information in this part, you can devise a strategy
for defeating the enemy.

I
f you’re thinking about joining the U.S. military, your AFQT score may well be the most
important score you achieve on any military test. Sure, other tests determine which mili-
tary jobs you may get or whether you get promoted, but what good are those if you can’t
get into the military in the first place? You need a qualifying score on the AFQT, or your
plans for enlistment come to a dead end. The military is not flexible on this point. You could
be a young Rambo in the making, in perfect health, able to run 3 miles in 3 minutes, and it
wouldn’t matter if you didn’t have a qualifying AFQT score.
The services have years and years of research to back up their policy. Study after study has
shown that an individual’s AFQT score is the single most significant factor in determining
whether a recruit will make it through basic training and the first enlistment period.
Considering the fact that it costs the military more than $25,000 to process a new recruit for
enlistment and send that person through basic training, you can see how the services want
to maximize their chances of getting their money’s worth.
But, with a little review, there is absolutely no reason that you shouldn’t be able to score well
on the AFQT. The score is, after all, composed of four areas that you studied intensely during
your high school years: basic math, math word problems, vocabulary, and reading. That’s
where ASVAB AFQT For Dummies comes in. Other preparation books try to prepare you for
the entire Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB), but this book is specifically
designed to help you boost the most important ASVAB score of all — the AFQT score.
A Close-Up View of the AFQT
The AFQT is not a stand-alone test. You can’t just walk into a recruiter’s office and say you
want to take the AFQT. You have to take the entire ASVAB, which consists of nine separate
subtests. Four of those subtests make up the score that’s known as the AFQT score. The
AFQT score determines whether you’re qualified to join the service of your choice. (Turn to
Chapter 2 for the minimum qualifying scores for each service.)

Here are the four subtests that make up your AFQT score:
 Arithmetic Reasoning: The Arithmetic Reasoning subtest consists of 30 math word
problems. The subtest is multiple choice. You’re given 36 minutes to correctly solve
as many of the 30 problems as you can. Chapter 10 leads you step-by-step through
solving math word problems. Take a look at Chapter 11 for some tips on doing well
on this subtest.
 Word Knowledge: The Word Knowledge subtest is a vocabulary test, plain and simple.
You have to find words that are “closest in meaning” to underlined words in the ques-
tion stem. There are 35 words to define in 11 minutes. You can boost your vocabulary
knowledge by following the advice in Chapter 4 and get an idea of what the subtest is
all about in Chapter 5.
 Paragraph Comprehension: The Paragraph Comprehension subtest requires you to
read a paragraph, and then answer one to four questions about information contained
in that paragraph. There are 15 questions in all, and you’re expected to complete the
subtest in 13 minutes. Chapter 6 can help you improve your reading comprehension
skills, and you can get a little practice with the Paragraph Comprehension subtest in
Chapter 7. (Note: Many other standardized tests refer to this type of question as “read-
ing comprehension.” The military likes to do things its own way, so it refers to them as
“paragraph comprehension” questions. Different name, same thing.)

Part I: Taking the AFQT Tour 
In the beginning, there was no AFQT
When you start basic training, you’ll learn about military
history. Why not start a little sooner and find out where
this whole testing thing came from?
The Army began general testing of draftees during World
War I. In order to provide a method for classifying these
soldiers, the Army developed the Army Alpha Test, which
consisted of 212 multiple-choice and true/false ques-
tions, including common-sense questions and vocabu-
lary and arithmetic problems. But many of the draftees
couldn’t read or write, so the Army developed the Army
Beta Test, which required little word knowledge and
relied on pictures and diagrams. Nearly 2 million solders
took one of these tests during World War I.
During World War II, the Army General Classification Test
(AGCT) replaced the Alpha and Beta tests. The new test
had 150 questions — mostly vocabulary and arithmetic.
The AGCT was used by the Army and Marine Corps to
assign recruits to military jobs. Of the 9 million soldiers
and marines who took this test during World War II, just
over 60 percent could read and write above a third-grade
level. During this time, a completely separate aptitude test
was given to Navy recruits; it was called the Navy
General Classification Test (NGCT). (The Air Force didn’t
have a test because the United States technically didn’t
have an Air Force as you know it today — the Air Force
was part of the Army back then.)
In 1948, Congress required the Department of Defense
to develop a uniform screening test to be used by all the
services. In 1950, the Department of Defense came up
with the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT). This
test consisted of 100 multiple-choice questions in areas
such as math, vocabulary, spatial relations, and mechan-
ical ability. The military used this test until the mid-1970s.
In addition to the AFQT, there were service-specific tests
required to classify prospective recruits into jobs. The
Army Classification Battery, the Navy Basic Test Battery,
and the Airman Qualification Examination (to name a
few), were used for classification purposes from the late
1950s to the mid-1970s.
In the 1960s, as military jobs began getting more diverse
and technical, the Department of Defense decided to
develop a standardized military selection and classifi-
cation test and administer it in high schools. That’s
where the ASVAB enters the picture. The first ASVAB
test was given in 1968, but the military didn’t use it for
recruiting purposes for several years. In 1973, the draft
ended and the nation entered the contemporary period
in which all military recruits are volunteers. That year,
the Air Force began using the ASVAB; the Marine Corps
followed in 1974. From 1973 to 1975, the Navy and Army
used their own test batteries for selection and classifi-
cation. In 1976, the ASVAB became the official military
job classification test used by all services, and the AFQT
score became the official entry standard.

 Mathematics Knowledge: This subtest measures your ability to solve high school–level
math problems. You have to solve 25 basic math problems in 24 minutes. Like the other
subtests of the AFQT, all the questions are multiple choice. To make sure your math
skills measure up, see Chapter 8. Chapter 9 gives you an idea about the test format, as
well as a little added math practice.
The AFQT isn’t the only qualifying standard used by the military. You have to meet all the set
standards in order to qualify for enlistment, including age, weight, number of dependents,
medical history, education level, and criminal history.
Some standards can be waived, depending on the service’s current recruiting needs.
However, the minimum AFQT score (see Chapter 2) is rarely waived. A high AFQT score can
help with other waivers. The higher your AFQT score, the more likely it is that a service
branch will favorably consider a waiver for other disqualifying factors. For example, if you
have too many criminal misdeeds in your past, and require a waiver to enlist, a service is
much more likely to grant the waiver if you score 85 on the AFQT, than if you score 45.
Why You Want the Highest Possible Score
Chapter 2 gives you the minimum AFQT qualifying scores for each service. But you don’t
want to be satisfied with making just the minimum. You want to score as high as possible.
The services put great stock in your AFQT score. Not only does a high AFQT score give you a
greater chance of enlistment, but it means you might have access to special treats, such as
the following:
 Enlistment incentives: Depending on current recruiting needs, individual services
often tie the AFQT score to enlistment incentives, such as monetary bonuses or educa-
tion benefits. For example, the Army often requires a minimum AFQT score of 50 to
qualify for a bonus or to qualify for the Army College Fund (a monetary incentive that
increases the value of the G.I. Bill).
 Enlistment programs: Most military jobs are tied to individual line scores derived from
the entire ASVAB, but certain enlistment programs sometimes require a minimum
AFQT score, which is significantly higher than the minimum score needed for a regular
enlistment. For example, some Navy jobs (such as those in the nuclear field) require a
higher AFQT score.
 Education level: In order to join any of the services, a high school diploma is required.
The services are, however, allowed to take a limited number of GED applicants each
year. In order to qualify with a GED, you must score higher on the AFQT than a quali-
fied high school diploma holder.
 Quotas: During times when the services are doing well meeting their recruiting goals,
they often get more people who want to join than they have room for. At these times, the
services get to pick and choose who they let join and who they don’t. It’s not unusual for
a branch to temporarily raise its AFQT minimum score in order to separate the best-qual-
ified applicants from the rest. For example, at the time this book went to print, the Army
National Guard wasn’t accepting anyone with an AFQT score less than 50.
 Waivers: One recent study indicated that only four out of ten people who walked into a
recruiter’s office were qualified for enlistment. Certain factors — such as criminal his-
tory, age, education level, number of dependents, or medical history — made them
ineligible. Some of these eligibility criteria can be waived. However, when the military
grants a waiver, it’s taking a chance on an otherwise ineligible recruit. The military is
much more likely to take a chance on someone with a high AFQT score than someone
who has a low (but qualifying) score.

Chapter 1: Examining the AFQT

Enlistment standards, programs, quotas and incentives change — sometimes on a week-by-
week basis, depending on the service’s current recruiting needs. For the latest information,
check with a military recruiter or visit http://usmilitary.about.com.
The AFQT is scored as a percentile. That means, for example, that if you score 70, you’ve
scored higher than 70 percent of the thousands of people who’ve taken the test before you.
The highest possible score on the AFQT is 99.
The AFQT isn’t a one-shot deal. If you don’t achieve a qualifying score, you can retest. After
your first test, you have to wait at least 30 days to take a second test. After the second test,
in most cases, you have to wait six months before you can test again. Keep trying until you
get the score you want and deserve.
Establishing a Study Program
If you’re not planning to make a study plan, you should plan again. A study plan is essential if
you want to score well on the AFQT.
There is no one best way to prepare a study plan. Each person has different ways of study
and learning that work the best for him. Still, people can generally be divided into three cate-
gories when it comes to learning:
 Auditory learners: These people learn best by hearing something. They do really well
in lecture classes, and they love listening to audiobooks.
 Visual learners: These folks prefer to learn by seeing something. They prefer to read a
book or look at a diagram.
 Tactical learners: These people get the best results by doing something. Instead of lis-
tening to an explanation or reading an instruction manual, they need to do it in order
to learn it.
Try to figure out what type of learner you are before developing a plan of study. Chapter 2
can help with this. Chapter 2 also includes some tips about what to include in your study
plan, based on your own individual learning style.
Most people don’t look forward to sitting down for a study session. Because of that, they try
to make study more enjoyable by spending time on the subjects they’re already good at.
After all, studying familiar information is much easier than learning something new. Try not
to fall into this trap! If you’re already an avid reader, you probably don’t need to spend much
of your time improving your reading comprehension skills. You’re already going to ace that
portion of the AFQT, right? Instead, spend most of your time boning up on the areas where
you need improvement, such as math and math word problems.
Try to dedicate one to two hours per day to your AFQT studies. Pick a time and place where
you won’t be interrupted. Having your dad yell at you to cut the grass probably won’t be
beneficial to your study session. Also, turn off your cellphone. Is that call as important as
your future military career? You won’t be allowed to use your cellphone in basic training
anyway, so this is a good time to get into the practice of not texting your BFF that OMG, J4I,
UBD is making me AAK.
Having raised twin daughters, I happen to be an expert on this texting stuff. Your BFF is your
“best friend forever.” And “OMG, J4I, UBD is making me AAK” translates to “Oh my God, just
for info, user brain damage is making me asleep at the keyboard.”

Part I: Taking the AFQT Tour 

Guessing Smart
All the questions on the ASVAB/AFQT are multiple-choice with four possible answers. That
means if you answer eeny-meeny-miny-mo, by the law of averages, you’d get one-fourth of
the questions right.
Of course, you can increase these odds immensely by studying. But the chances are good
that no matter how much time you put into advanced study, you’ll come across at least one
question on the test that leaves you scratching your head.
When this happens, you can improve your odds of guessing correctly by guessing smart. See
Chapter 5 for tips on intelligent guessing for the Word Knowledge subtest, Chapter 7 for tech-
niques you can use on the Paragraph Comprehension subtest, Chapter 9 for Mathematics
Knowledge subtest guessing plans, and Chapter 11 to learn how to make intelligent guesses
on the Arithmetic Knowledge subtest. Chapter 3 includes tips and techniques about smart
guessing in general.
Using the Practice Exams to Your Advantage
This book includes four full-length AFQT practice exams, with questions that are very similar
to the ones you’ll see on the ASVAB subtests that comprise the AFQT score. The practice
exams included in this book can help increase your confidence and ensure that you’re ready
to take the actual ASVAB, but you have to use them correctly.
When I wrote my first book, ASVAB For Dummies, many readers contacted me. Some were
disappointed that the practice tests included in the book were not the exact same as the
questions they found on the actual ASVAB. I’ll let you in on a little not-so-secret secret: No
ASVAB or AFQT preparation book will include the exact same questions as what you’ll find
on the actual test. Not only would that be unethical, but it would probably result in several
federal law-enforcement agents knocking on the author’s door — not my idea of a good time.
Actual ASVAB test questions are controlled items — that means that the military keeps them
to themselves. If you see any questions on the actual ASVAB or AFQT that are the exact same
as the ones you find in this book (or any other preparation guide), it’s pure coincidence.
However, just because the practice exams don’t include the exact same questions that you’ll
see on the AFQT doesn’t mean that the practice exams aren’t valuable — just use them the
way they were designed to be used:
 Practice Exam 1: The first practice test is designed as an initial assessment tool. Take
this test before you set up your study plan. You can use the results of Practice Exam 1
to determine which areas of the AFQT you need to spend the most time on.
 Practice Exam 2: Use this test as a progress check after a week or two of study. Adjust
your study plan accordingly.
 Practice Exam 3: Take this practice exam about a week before you’re scheduled to take
the actual ASVAB. Use the results to determine which AFQT subjects need a little extra
attention.
 Practice Exam 4: Take the final practice exam a day or two before the ASVAB to make
sure you’re ready, and to boost your confidence. If you don’t score well, you may want
to consider asking your recruiter to reschedule your ASVAB test for a later date, to give
you more time to study.
11
Chapter 1: Examining the AFQT

You may find your recruiter trying to rush you to take the ASVAB and medical exam, so he
can get you signed up quickly. Recruiters live and die off their recruiting goals. Make sure
you don’t let the recruiter schedule your exam until you’re sure you’re ready to take the test.
The mini-AFQT computerized test (see Chapter 2) that recruiters have in their offices is a
pretty good indicator of whether you’re ready for the real test. Usually, people’s AFQT score
is within five or six points of what the mini-AFQT predicts.
Although you can’t equate scores on the practice exam with actual AFQT scores (because of
the method of scoring the AFQT; see Chapter 2), shoot for a minimum of 80 percent on each
subtest:
 Arithmetic Reasoning: This subtest has 30 questions. If you miss more than 6, you
should dedicate more study time to solving math problems.
 Word Knowledge: There are 35 questions on the Word Knowledge Subtest. You need to
focus more attention on this area if you miss more than 7 questions.
 Paragraph Comprehension: If you miss more than 3 of the 15 Paragraph Comprehension
questions, dedicate more study time to your reading skills.
 Mathematics Knowledge: Missing more than 5 questions on this 25-question subtest
indicates the need for further study.

 Taking the test again to get a better score
I
n order to enlist in the U.S. military, everyone has to take the Armed Services Vocational
Aptitude Battery (ASVAB). The ASVAB consists of nine separately timed subtests, which
are primarily used by the military to determine your aptitude to learn various military jobs.
Four of the ASVAB subtests are used to compute the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT)
score. This score determines whether you’re qualified to join the military service of your
choice. Each branch of military service has its own minimum AFQT score standards. Your
AFQT score tells the military what your chances are of making it successfully through your
enlistment period. The services have conducted countless studies over the years, and the
results are very clear: The higher your AFQT score, the greater the chances that you’ll suc-
cessfully complete your enlistment contract.
As you can imagine, the AFQT score is very important to the military recruiting commands.
If you have a high AFQT score, you can expect your recruiter to be wining and dining you,
offering you all kinds of enlistment incentives, and telling all his co-workers that you’re his
very best friend. On the other hand, if your AFQT score is below the minimum standards set
by that service, you can expect your recruiter to say, “Don’t call us — we’ll call you.” If you
have a qualifying AFQT score that’s mediocre, you can probably still enlist, but you’ll most
likely miss out on many enlistment goodies, such as enlistment bonuses. (Maybe you’ll get a
free T-shirt.)
In this chapter, I explain which of the four ASVAB subtests are used to compute your AFQT score
and how the military calculates the score. I also tell you the minimum qualifying AFQT scores
for each service branch, and explain how you can request a retest if your score is too low.
ASVAB: The Big Picture
There are several versions of the ASVAB, depending on where, and for what purpose, you
take the test. However, for the purposes of this discussion, I can separate them into just two:
the computerized version, and the pencil-and-paper version.
The computerized version of the ASVAB contains nine separately timed subtests. The paper
format of the test has only eight subtests: The Assembling Objects (AO) subtest is not
included on any of the paper versions. In Table 2-1, I outline the nine ASVAB subtests in the
order that you take them.

* Used to calculate the AFQT score
** Only included on the computer version of the ASVAB
You can’t take just the four AFQT subtests of the ASVAB. You have to take all nine subtests in
order to get a qualifying AFQT score. The military isn’t set up to give partial ASVAB tests. For
example, if you take the ASVAB and get line scores that qualify you for the military job(s) you
want, but your AFQT score is too low to join, you have to retake the entire ASVAB — not just
the four subtests that make up the AFQT — to get a higher AFQT score.
During the initial enlistment process your service branch determines your military job or
enlistment program based on minimum line scores they’ve established. Line scores are com-
puted from the various subtests of the ASVAB. If you get an appropriate score in the appro-
priate areas, you can get the job you want — as long as that job is available and you meet
other established qualification factors.
The computerized ASVAB
Nobody really cares about the AFQT score except the military — and they care a lot! So,
because you’re reading this book, it’s a safe bet that you’re interested in joining the military.
And if you’re interested in joining the military, there is a greater than 90 percent chance that
you’ll take the computerized version of the ASVAB. That’s because more than 90 percent of
those taking the ASVAB for the purpose of joining the military take it at a Military Entrance
Processing Station (MEPS), and all of these places use the computerized test.
The computerized version of the ASVAB — called the CAT-ASVAB (CAT stands for Computerized
Adaptive Testing) — has the same questions as the paper version. The CAT-ASVAB adapts the
questions it offers you based on your level of proficiency. (That’s why it’s called adaptive.) The
first test item is of average difficulty. If you answer this question correctly, the next question is
14
Part I: Taking the AFQT Tour 

more difficult. If you answer the first question incorrectly, the computer gives you an easier
question. (By contrast, on the pencil-and-paper ASVAB, hard and easy questions are presented
randomly.) On the ASVAB, harder questions are worth more points than easier questions, so you
want to get to them sooner, to maximize your score.
Pros
Maybe it’s because young people today are more comfortable in front of a computer than
they are with paper and pencil, but military recruiters have noted that, among applicants
who have taken both the paper-based version and the computerized version of the ASVAB,
recruits tend to score slightly higher on the computerized version of the test.
When you take the CAT-ASVAB, the computer automatically calculates and prints your stan-
dard scores for each subtest and your line scores for each service branch. (If you’re interested
in line scores, which are used for military job-classification purposes, you may want to pick up
a copy of ASVAB For Dummies.) This machine is a pretty smart cookie — it also calculates your
AFQT score on the spot. With the computerized version, you usually know if you qualify for
military enlistment on the same day you take the test and, if so, which jobs you qualify for.
Cons
Unlike the pencil-and-paper version, you can’t skip questions or change your answers after
you enter them on the CAT-ASVAB. This restriction can make taking the test harder for some
people. Instead of being able to go through and immediately answer all the questions you’re
sure of and then come back to the questions that require you to do some head scratching,
you have to answer each question as it comes. Also, judging how much time to spend on a
difficult question before guessing and moving on can be tough. Finally, if you have a few min-
utes at the end of the test, you can’t go back and check to make sure you marked the correct
answer to each question.
The pencil-and-paper test
Most people take the pencil-and-paper version of the ASVAB under the Institutional ASVAB
Program, a cooperative program between the Department of Education and the Department
of Defense at high schools all across the United States. Although the results of this version
can be used for military enlistment purposes (if taken within two years of enlistment), its pri-
mary purpose is to serve as a tool for high school guidance counselors to use when recom-
mending possible careers to high school students.
The pencil-and-paper version can also be taken for purposes of enlistment through a
recruiter, but that’s not done very often these days. In unusual circumstances, when it’s
impractical for an applicant to travel to a MEPS location, arrangements can be made to
administer the pencil-and-paper version locally.
A final pencil-and-paper version of the ASVAB is the Armed Forces Classification Test (AFCT).
This version of the ASVAB is used by folks already in the military who want to improve their
ASVAB scores for the purposes of retraining into a different military job. Except for the name
of the exam, the AFCT is exactly the same as the other versions of the ASVAB.
Pros
The paper-based test allows you to skip questions that you don’t know the answer to and
come back to them later. You can’t do this on the CAT-ASVAB. This option can be a real help
when you’re racing against the clock and want to get as many answers right as possible. You
can change an answer on the subtest you’re currently working on, but you can’t change an
answer on a subtest after the time for that subtest has expired.
15
Chapter 2: Facing the AFQT Head-on

You can mark up the exam booklet as much as you want. If you skip a question, you can
circle the number of the question in your booklet to remind yourself to go back to it. If you
don’t know the answer to a question, you can cross off the answers that seem unlikely or
wrong to you and then guess based on the remaining answers.
Cons
On the pencil-and-paper version, harder questions are randomly intermingled with easier
questions, so you may find yourself spending too much time trying to figure out the answer to
a question that’s too hard for you, and you may miss answering some easier questions at the
end of the subtest because you ran out of time. The result: Your overall score will be lowered.
The paper answer sheets are scored using an optical scanning machine. The machine has a
conniption when it comes across an incompletely filled-in answer circle or stray pencil marks
and will often stubbornly refuse to give you credit for these questions, even if you answered
correctly.
Finally, it may take a week or more (sometimes up to a month — remember, we’re talking mil-
itary efficiency here) to get your scores.
Scoring the AFQT
If the military would simply score the subtests of the ASVAB as “number correct,” or even
“percent correct,” a recruiter’s life would be much easier. But, the military being the military,
it does it the hard way.
The AFQT is often mistakenly called the “overall ASVAB score.” It’s not uncommon to hear
someone say, “I got a 67 on the ASVAB,” or “My ASVAB score was 92.” That’s not correct — it
implies that the AFQT is derived from all nine subtests of the ASVAB, and it’s not. The AFQT
score is computed from just four of the ASVAB subtests — the four subtests of the ASVAB
that measure your math and communicative ability (see “ASVAB: The Big Picture,” earlier in
this chapter).
In this section, I explain how the AFQT is scored.
16
Part I: Taking the AFQT Tour 
The mini-AFQT
There is sort of a “mini-AFQT” you may take in the
recruiter’s office. This test is called the Computer
Adaptive Screening Test (CAST). Another version in use
is called the Enlistment Screening Test (EST).
The CAST and EST are not qualification tests — they’re
strictly recruiting tools. These tests may be administered
at the discretion of a recruiter. The CAST and EST contain
questions similar (but not identical) to questions appear-
ing on the ASVAB. They’re used to help estimate an appli-
cant’s probability of obtaining a qualifying AFQT score. If
you take one of these “mini-tests” and score low, you
probably don’t want to take the actual ASVAB until you’ve
put in some extensive study time. In fact, many recruiters
won’t even schedule you for the ASVAB unless you score
well on the CAST or EST.

Understanding raw scores
The military scores each subtest of the ASVAB using a raw score. A raw score is the total
number of points you receive on each subtest of the ASVAB. Although you won’t see your
raw scores on the ASVAB score cards, they are used to calculate the other scores that the
military uses, such as line scores used for job qualification.
You can’t use the practice tests in this book (or any other ASVAB or AFQT study guide) to
calculate your probable ASVAB scores. ASVAB scores are calculated using raw scores, and
raw scores are not determined simply from the number of right or wrong answers. On the
actual ASVAB, harder questions are worth more points than easier questions.
Computing the verbal expression score
The verbal expression (VE) score is used by the military to measure your communicative
ability. The score is used not only when computing the AFQT score, but also to compute
many of the military’s line scores (scores that determine military job qualifications). The mili-
tary brass (or at least their computers) determine your VE score by first adding the value of
your Word Knowledge (WK) raw score to your Paragraph Comprehension (PC) raw score.
The result is then converted to a scaled score, ranging from 20 to 62.
The AFQT score formula
To get your AFQT raw score, the computer doubles your VE score, and then adds your
Arithmetic Reasoning (AR) score and your Mathematics Knowledge (MK) score to it. Here’s
the formula:
AFQT raw score = 2VE + AR + MK
You won’t get to see what your AFQT raw score is on your ASVAB score sheet. The computer
converts the score into a percentile score.
Normalizing the percentile score
Your AFQT raw score is converted to an AFQT percentile score, ranging from 1 to 99. How is
that done? In 1997, the Department of Defense conducted a “Profile of American Youth”
study, which examined the AFQT raw scores of a national probability sample of 18- to 23-
year-olds who took the ASVAB during that year.
Your AFQT percentile score is derived by comparing your AFQT raw score to those of the
approximately 14,000 young people who took part in the study. For example, an AFQT per-
centile score of 50 means that you scored better than 50 percent of the individuals included
in the 1997 study.
17
Chapter 2: Facing the AFQT Head-on

Minimum Qualifying Scores
The primary purpose of the AFQT percentile score is to determine whether you qualify for
the military service of your choice. Each of the branches has its own priorities, so they all
have different minimum qualifying scores.
The AFQT tier categories
AFQT scores are grouped into five categories based on the percentile score ranges shown in
Table 2-2. People who score in Categories I and II tend to be above average in trainability;
those in Category III, average; those in Category IV, below average; and those in Category V,
markedly below average.
Table 2-2
AFQT Tiers
Category
Percentile Score
I
93–100
II
65–92
III A
50–64
III B
31–49
IV A
21–30
IV B
16–20
IV C
10–15
V
0–9
If your AFQT percentile score falls into Category I, all the military services want you — and
want you very badly. They also want you if your score falls into Category II or Category IIIA.
If your score falls into Category IIIB, you may or may not be able to enlist, depending in large
part on how the branch is currently doing on making its recruiting goals.
Congress has directed that the military cannot accept Category V recruits or more than
4 percent of recruits from Category IV. If you’re in Category IV, you must have a high school
diploma to be eligible for enlistment; you can’t do it with a GED. Even so, if your score falls
into Category IV, your chances of enlistment are small — very small.
Making the military cut
Each of the services has established minimum AFQT qualification scores within its respec-
tive recruiting regulations:
 Army (including Army National Guard and Army Reserves): The Army requires a
minimum AFQT score of 31 for those with a high school diploma and 50 for those with
a GED. At times when the Army is experiencing high recruiting and reenlistment rates,
it has been known to temporarily increase its qualifying AFQT score minimum to as
high as 50.
18
Part I: Taking the AFQT Tour 

 Air Force (including Air National Guard and Air Force Reserves): Air Force recruits
must score at least 36 points on the AFQT to qualify for enlistment. In actuality, the vast
majority (over 70 percent) of those accepted for an Air Force enlistment score 50 or
above. For those who have a GED, rather than a high school diploma, the minimum is 65.
You’re more likely to be struck by lightning than enlist in the Air Force without a high
school diploma. Only about 0.5 percent of all Air Force enlistments each year are GED
holders.
 Navy: Navy recruits must score at least 35 on the AFQT to qualify for enlistment. For
GED holders, the minimum score is 50.
 Navy Reserves: The Navy Reserves requires a minimum score of 31 on the AFQT for
those with a high school diploma and 50 for those with a GED.
The Navy is the only branch for which the requirements for the Reserves are different
from the requirements for the branch itself.
 Marine Corps (including Marine Corps Reserves): Marine Corps recruits must score
at least 32. Very few exceptions are made (about 1 percent) for some otherwise excep-
tionally qualified recruits with scores as low as 25. Those with a GED must score a min-
imum of 50 on the AFQT to be considered. The Marine Corps limits GED enlistments to
no more than 5 percent per year.
 Coast Guard (including Coast Guard Reserves): The Coast Guard requires a minimum
of 40 points on the AFQT. A waiver is possible for applicants with prior service if their
ASVAB line scores (which are computed from the various ASVAB subtests) qualify them
for a specific job and they’re willing to enlist in that job. For the very few people (less
than 5 percent) who are allowed to enlist with a GED, the minimum AFQT score is 50.
Just because you’ve met the minimum qualifying score for the service of your choice, that’s
no guarantee of enlistment. During good recruiting times, it’s not uncommon for a military
branch to get more qualified applicants than it has slots for. During these times, the military
has to pick and choose which applicants to accept, and which ones to turn away. Quite often,
they do this based on AFQT scores.
Also, enlistment incentives, such as enlistment bonuses and college funds (educational assis-
tance) are often tied to minimum AFQT scores. As with quotas, this is subject to change at
any time, based on the service’s current recruiting needs.
Retaking the Test
You can’t actually “fail” the AFQT, but you can fail to achieve a high enough score to enlist in
the service you want. If this happens, that means your AFQT score was too low, which, in
turn, means that you need to work on one (or more) of four areas: math knowledge, arith-
metic reasoning, reading comprehension, and word knowledge. These are the four subtests
that are used to calculate your AFQT score. Parts II and III of this book are specifically
designed to help you improve your scores on these four subtests.
When you’re sure that you’re ready, you can apply (through your recruiter) for a retest.
ASVAB tests are valid for two years, as long as you aren’t in the military. In most cases, after
you join the military, your ASVAB scores remain valid as long as you’re in. In other words,
except in a few cases, you can use your enlistment ASVAB scores to qualify for retraining
years later.
19
Chapter 2: Facing the AFQT Head-on

After you take an initial ASVAB test (taking the ASVAB in high school doesn’t count as an ini-
tial test), you can retake the test after 30 days. After the retest, you must wait at least six
months before taking the ASVAB again.
When you retake the ASVAB, it’s not your highest score that counts, but rather the score on
your most recent test. If you score lower on the retest, that is the score that will be used for
your military enlistment.
The bad news is that you can’t retake the ASVAB on a whim or whenever you feel like it. Each
of the services has its own rules.
Army
The Army will allow a retest only if
 Your previous ASVAB test has expired. Remember: Test scores are valid for two years.
 You failed to achieve an AFQT score high enough to qualify for enlistment.
 Unusual circumstances occur. For example, if you’re called away from the test because
of an emergency, you can retake the test.
Army recruiters are not allowed to schedule a retest for the sole purpose of increasing
scores in order to qualify for enlistment incentives, job qualifications, or other special enlist-
ment programs.
Air Force
The Air Force does not allow you to retest after you’ve enlisted in the Delayed Entry Program
(DEP). Current policy allows retesting of applicants who are not in the DEP, but already have
a qualifying AFQT score. Retesting is authorized when the applicant’s current line scores (job
qualification scores) limit the ability to match an Air Force skill with his qualifications.
These days, you can just take the ASVAB and a medical examination and head straight out to
basic training. You have to wait your turn. The military only has so many basic training slots
each month, and they have to reserve a slot for you (often several months in the future). To
ensure your commitment, the services enlist you in the DEP. Under this program, you’re
enlisted in the inactive reserves, while waiting for your basic training date to arrive.
Navy
The Navy allows you to retake the test if your previous ASVAB test has expired, or you’ve
failed to achieve a qualifying AFQT score for enlistment in the Navy.
In most cases, individuals in the DEP cannot retest. One notable exception is the Navy’s DEP
Enrichment Program. This program provides for the provisional DEP enlistment of high school
diploma graduates with AFQT scores between 28 and 30. Individuals enlisted under the pro-
gram are enrolled in academic enhancement training, retested with the ASVAB, and accessed
onto active duty as long as they score 31 or higher on the subsequent ASVAB retest.
20
Part I: Taking the AFQT Tour 

Marine Corps
The Marine Corps will authorize a retest if your previous test is expired. Otherwise,
recruiters can request a retest as long as the retesting is being required because the initial
scores (considering your education, training, and experience) do not appear to reflect your
true capability.
Additionally, the retest cannot be requested solely because your initial test scores did not
meet the standards prescribed for specific military job qualification.
Coast Guard
For Coast Guard enlistments, six months must elapse since your last test before you may
retest solely for the purpose of raising scores to qualify for a particular enlistment option.
The Coast Guard Recruiting Center may authorize retesting after 30 days have passed from
an initial ASVAB test if substantial reason exists to believe that your initial AFQT score or
subtest scores do not reflect your education, training, or experience.

The Art of Studying and Test Taking
In This Chapter
 Reading the right way
 Discovering your learning style
 Making time to study
 Sitting down to the test
A
military career is all about taking tests. You take tests to enter the military, you take
tests in basic training, you take tests when learning your new military job, you take
tests to re-certify in your military job every few years, and you even take tests to earn
promotions!
As a first sergeant, if I had a dime for every time I heard someone say, “I just can’t take tests,”
then, well, then I’d have a lot of dimes. I said it then to the troops, and I’ll say it to you now:
There’s no such thing. If you couldn’t take tests, you never would’ve made it through high
school or gotten a GED, and one of the two is required in order to join the military. The truth
of the matter is that, when people get out of a school environment, they quickly lose the
motivation and skills to study properly. Lack of success in test taking has more to do with
ineffective study skills and techniques than intellectual ability.
Effective studying doesn’t happen overnight. Studying requires time and patience. Getting the
highest possible AFQT score is very much an individual affair — there is no one path that will
always produce the best results for everyone. Studying is a process that you learn through
trial and error — you have to discover a strategy that works for you.
By incorporating the reading rules, study strategies, and test-taking techniques covered in
this chapter, you should increase your chances of achieving the study and test-taking goals
you set for yourself.
Reading for Study
I know what you’re thinking: “Wait a minute. You talk about reading comprehension in
Chapter 6. Why am I reading about reading here?” Reading for the purposes of study is a dif-
ferent kind of reading. Reading comprehension only requires you to place information into
short-term memory long enough to answer a question about it a few seconds later. In order
to read for the purposes of study, you need to commit important information to your long-
term memory — at least long enough to take the ASVAB.

Survey, question, read, recall, and review
This method is affectionately known as the SQR3 method by those who make a living teach-
ing students how to study. This method helps you separate the important information from
the chaff.
Survey
The first step is to survey the material to get the big picture. This quick preview allows you
to focus your attention on the main ideas and to identify the sections you want to read in
detail. The purpose is to determine which portions of the text are most applicable to your
task. Read the table of contents, introduction, section headings, subheadings, summaries,
and the bibliography. Skim the text in between. Be sure to look at any figures, diagrams,
charts, and highlighted areas.
Question
After you’ve gained a feel for the substance of the material, compose questions about the
subject you want answered. First, ask yourself what you already know about the topic. Next,
compose your questions.
Read
Now go back and read those sections you identified during your survey and search for
answers to your questions. Look for the ideas behind words.
Recall
To help retain the material, make a point to summarize the information you’ve read at appro-
priate intervals — such as the end of paragraphs, sections, and chapters. Your goal is not to
remember everything you’ve read — just the important points. Recite these points silently or
aloud. Reciting the points will help you improve your concentration. You can also jot down
any important or useful points. Finally, determine what information you still need to obtain.
Review
This last step involves reviewing the information you’ve read. Skim a section or chapter
immediately after you finish reading it. You can do this by skimming back over the material
and by looking at any notes you made. Go back over all the questions you posed and see if
you can answer them.
Taking notes
Reading something once is not enough to really learn it. That’s why note taking is so impor-
tant. Clearly written, accurate notes help to capture information for later study and review.
Taking notes also helps you to focus and learn during your study time.
Here are some note-taking and note-studying tips:
 Organize the information. Arrange data or ideas into small groups that make sense to
you. The smaller groups will make it easier to remember the information.
 Make the information relevant. Connect the new information with the information you
already know. Recalling the information you already know about a subject makes it
easier to recall the new stuff.
24
Part I: Taking the AFQT Tour 

 Learn actively. Use all your senses. Don’t just speak aloud when reviewing your
notes — get your entire body into the act. Get up and move around as if you’re
practicing for a speech.
 Use your long-term memory. To commit information to your long-term memory,
review the material several times. Take advantage of your ability to remember best
what you read last by changing the order of the information you recite during your
review.
Putting Study Strategies to Work for You
Knowing how to study is like knowing how to fish. It’s a set of learning skills that lasts a life-
time and brings many rewards. Just as there are many ways to fish, there are many ways to
study. The key is finding the techniques that work best for you.
Working with your own learning style
Individuals learn best in individual ways. Some people may learn faster by hearing some-
thing. For others, seeing something may be the way. Still others may learn best by doing
something. No one style of learning is better than another. However, by identifying your
dominant learning style, you can adjust your study techniques to your individual learning
abilities.
Auditory learners
Auditory learners use hearing to process information. When given a choice, strong auditory
learners will sit where they can easily hear the speaker and where outside sounds will not
interfere. Some auditory learners sit to one side, on the side of their strongest ear. Many
times, auditory learners have an easier time understanding the words from songs on the
radio and announcements on public address systems than other people do.
Here are some characteristics of auditory learners:
 They prefer to hear information.
 They have difficulty following written directions.
 They have difficulty with reading and writing.
 They may not look the speaker in the eye; instead, they may turn their eyes away
so they can focus more on listening.
If you’re an auditory learner, keep in mind the following study suggestions:
 Use audiotapes or CDs for reading and lectures (when available).
 Participate in discussions, ask questions, and repeat given information.
 Summarize or paraphrase written material, and record the information.
 Discuss the material with someone else.
25
Chapter 3: The Art of Studying and Test Taking

Visual learners
Visual learners need to see the big picture. They may choose a seat where they can see the
whole stage or the whole screen. They may like the back seat so everything is out in front
and they can see it all. Visual learners survey the scene, like to sightsee, and see the forest
despite the trees.
Visual learners share the following characteristics:
 They need to see it to learn it — they must have a mental picture.
 They have artistic ability.
 They have difficulty with spoken directions.
 They find sounds distracting.
 They have trouble following lectures.
 They may misinterpret words.
If you’re a visual learner, follow these suggestions:
 Use visuals (graphics, films, slides, illustrations, doodles, charts, notes, and flashcards)
to reinforce learning.
 Use multicolored highlighters to organize your notes.
 Write down directions.
 Visualize words, phrases, and sentences to be memorized.
 Write everything down; review often.
Tactile learners
Tactile learners have the need to touch and feel things. They want to feel or experience the
lesson themselves. Given a choice, strong tactile learners will be right in the middle of the
action. They tear things apart to see how they work and put them back together without
the directions. Tactile learners immediately adjust the seat, mirror, radio, and temperature
when they get in the car.
Here are some characteristics of tactile learners:
 They prefer hands-on learning or training.
 They can put a bicycle together without the directions.
 They have difficulty sitting still.
 They learn better when they can get involved.
 They may be coordinated and have athletic ability.
If you’re a tactile learner, try the following strategies:
 Make a model, do lab work, role-play, “be the ball.”
 Take frequent breaks.
 Copy letters and words to learn how to spell and remember facts.
 Use a computer to study as much as possible.
 Write facts and figures over and over.
 Read and walk, talk and walk, repeat and walk.

Part I: Taking the AFQT Tour 

Getting the most out of your study time
Whether you’re studying for the ASVAB, the AFQT, military promotion tests, or a college
course, proper study techniques will help you attain your goals.
Staying motivated
Studying and learning can take you so far in life, yet it can feel so hard to get down to it.
Whether studying for college or to advance your career, studying can be one of the most
important things you should be doing. Modern life — whether commercials, the Internet,
friends, or TV — continually demands your attention, and all these things can feel easier
to attend to than study. So, what can you do to help stay motivated?
 Give your study the attention it deserves. If you were totally isolated, say on a desert
island, where there was absolutely nothing else to do other than study, you’d study
every last morsel of your subject until you were completely versed in it because there
would be nothing else to distract you. Imagine being in a cell with no TV and nothing
except ASVAB AFQT For Dummies. You’d certainly read it cover to cover — and maybe
many times! You’d know this book inside out because it’s all you’d have to do. Having
too much choice, too much possibility over what you pay attention to means that now,
more than ever before in history, you need to exert willpower to stay motivated.
 Think about your goals. Consider why you’re studying and what you’re studying for
because, presumably, it connects to what you want your life to be. All kinds of things
may distract you when you’re not studying. But ask yourself, do you want your life to
be about drinking coffee, playing computer games, watching TV, and chatting with
friends, or do you have bigger fish to fry? Your life is about what you do with it, day in
and day out.
 Feed and develop your mind. We live in a culture of entertainment where everything
is supposed to be fun and exciting. If you buy into this idea too much, then you stop
benefiting from the more subtle stimuli, because they don’t immediately excite you.
Your mind needs the rigor of study as well as the relaxation of entertainment. When
you study well, you find it has its own subtle pleasures and satisfactions above and
beyond the good results it can bring into your life. Imagine what it would be like to feel
compelled to study hard and well.
Managing your time
You may have all the time in the world, but if you don’t use it wisely, it won’t help you to
meet your goals. Procrastination is a problem for many people studying for the ASVAB or
AFQT. The following tips will help you deal with this issue:
 Clear your schedule. Recognize that your obligations and the resulting stress are as
important as other people’s needs. Set limits around being interrupted or rescheduling
your work time to accommodate others. Omit or reschedule some of your other obliga-
tions. You want to give full concentration to your studies without feeling guilty about
what you’re not doing.
 Create a work area that is free from distractions and commit to staying there for at
least one to two hours. If you get side-tracked, remind yourself how this activity will
help you to meet your goals.
 Prioritize. What has to be done first? What is worth more in terms of your AFQT score?
(Chapter 2 can help you with this.) What is worth more in terms of your personal, edu-
cational, or career goals?
27
Chapter 3: The Art of Studying and Test Taking

 Use a daily to-do list. This list will help you reach your goals and prioritize your daily
tasks. As soon as you’ve completed a task, check it off your list. If you like keeping
things on your computer, check out Remember The Milk (www.rememberthemilk.com),
a free online to-do list.
 Break down your study into chunks. Estimate how much time you’ll need to complete
the task. Don’t try to do it all at once. Break it down so that it’s doable and not so over-
whelming. Stay up to date on assignments to help avoid overload.
 Recognize that you don’t have to be perfect. Some people are so afraid that they
won’t perform perfectly that they don’t do anything at all. Make sure you understand
your goals. Then evaluate how important your study is and what level of performance
is acceptable to you. Then just do it!
If you score better than the 50th percentile on the AFQT, you become a very attractive
candidate to the military. You don’t need a perfect score to get recruiters to chase you
all over town.
 Make study enjoyable. Work on this task first, while you have more energy. Reward
yourself when you check tasks off your daily to-do list.
You’re only human, so you’ll probably gravitate toward studying the subject areas that you
have an interest in or that you’re good at. If you’re an avid reader, don’t spend too much of
your time studying reading comprehension. (You’re already going to ace that part of the
test.) On the other hand, if you had a hard time in math in high school, you’ll want to spend
extra time brushing up on your arithmetic skills.
Finding the right place to study
After you’ve found the time to study, commit to a time and place that meets your needs. In
order to do this, ask yourself whether the environment in which you’re studying matches
your learning style. If you don’t know your dominant learning styles, refer to the “Working
with your own learning style” section, earlier in this chapter. Here are some aspects of the
study environment you may need to consider:
 Time of day: Whenever possible, schedule your most challenging courses and most
intense study sessions during the time of day when you’re most alert. Some people are
at their best in the morning; others don’t get rolling until late afternoon. You know how
you work, so plan to study when you can give your best to it.
 Posture and mobility: Some people prefer to sit at a table or desk (in a formal posture)
in order to concentrate and study effectively. Others are able to learn more easily while
sitting comfortably on a sofa or lying on the floor (in an informal posture). Still others
need to move about in order to learn; reading while walking on a treadmill may be
appropriate for them. Some people can sit and study for long periods of time (they
have high persistence), while others need to take frequent breaks (they have low per-
sistence). Recognizing your posture and mobility needs will help you to plan where
and when you should study.
 Sound: Contrary to popular belief, not everyone needs to study in a perfectly quiet
environment. If you do choose to study to music, choose baroque classical music, such
as Johann Sebastian Bach and Antonio Vivaldi. The tempo and instrumentation of this
music seems to be most compatible with study and learning.
Several studies have shown that baroque music, with a 60 beats-per-minute beat pat-
tern, activates the left and right brain. The simultaneous left- and right-brain action
maximizes learning and retention of information, according to one study conducted by
the Center for New Discoveries in Learning.
28
Part I: Taking the AFQT Tour 

 Lighting: Studies have shown that some people become depressed because of light
deprivation during the winter months. If you’re one of those people, try to study and
spend as much time as possible in highly lit places.
Other studies have shown reading ability can be affected by the light contrast between
print and paper color. There is a high contrast between black letters printed on white
paper. Some people find it easier to read black print on blue or gray paper, which has
less contrast and is easier on their eyes. (You can’t always choose the paper your
study material is printed on, but you can choose it for note-taking and reviewing pur-
poses.) Light does make a difference, so study in the environment that best matches
your learning preferences.
 Temperature: You can’t always control the temperature of a room, but you should be
aware of your preference for either a cool or warm environment. Dress in layers so that
you can adjust to differences in room temperatures. Study in the environments in
which you feel most comfortable.
Setting goals
Setting goals is a good way to accomplish a particularly difficult task. Developing study skills
is one such task that takes time and effort to master. By setting S.M.A.R.T. goals related to an
area of your study skills that needs improvement, you’ll be studying like a pro in no time!
S.M.A.R.T. goals are
 Specific: After you decide what you want to work on, narrow it down to one thing. Be
as specific as possible. Working out one problem at a time will make it much easier to
reach your goal without spreading yourself too thin. “I want to be a better reader” is
too broad. Be more specific — for example, you might say, “I want to improve my read-
ing speed.” Write down this specific goal.
 Measurable: Goals can only be achieved if they can be measured in some way. For
example, instead of “I want to improve my reading speed,” a measurable goal would be
“I want to improve my reading speed by ten words per minute.”
 Action: This is where you decide how you’re going to achieve your goal. Write this part
as an “I will” statement. Following the example I give in the last bullet, your goal would
now look something like, “I want to improve my reading speed by ten words a minute.
I will do this by skimming over words like the and an.”
 Realistic: Make sure your goals are within reach. “I will improve my reading speed by
memorizing every word in the dictionary” is not reasonable for most people. Everyone
has limits due to time, resources, or ability. Don’t ignore these restraints or you’ll be
setting yourself up to fail.
 Timeline: Set a date to accomplish the goal. Make sure this date is both specific and
realistic for you. “I will meet this goal sometime over the summer” is vague. Try some-
thing more like, “I will meet this goal by the first day of school next fall.” This gives you
a definite time to shoot for and will help keep you working toward the goal. Goals can
take only a few days to achieve, or they may take months or years. Just be sure to
make it a realistic timeline for you and your lifestyle.
Taking the Test: Putting Your Best Foot Forward
Sooner or later, the time for you to actually sit down and take the ASVAB will arrive. It may
arrive before you think you’re ready. Or you may think that test day can’t get here fast enough.
Regardless of which group you fall into, by understanding test-taking techniques, keeping a
positive attitude, and overcoming your fears, you’ll improve your test-taking ability.
29
Chapter 3: The Art of Studying and Test Taking

Approach the big test as you’d approach a giant jigsaw puzzle. It may be tough, but you can
do it! A positive attitude goes a long way toward success. Use the practice tests in Part IV to
familiarize yourself with the test structure and to build your confidence in the subject matter.
Although the questions are not the exact questions you’ll see on the ASVAB, they are very,
very similar. If you score well on the practice tests, you’ll score well on the AFQT.
Some of the tricky problems can knock you off balance. However, if you prepare a plan of
attack for what to do if you get stuck, you won’t get worried or frustrated. In each of the
chapters where I describe the individual tests (Chapters 5, 7, 9, and 11), I give you tips about
what to do when all looks bleak. Go over these individual techniques before the test and
make sure you have them down pat.
The night before
Cramming doesn’t work. If you’ve followed a study plan, the night before the test you should
do a quick review and get to bed early. Remember: Your brain and body need sleep to func-
tion well, so don’t stay up late!
On the afternoon or evening before the test, get some exercise. Exercise can help you remain
mentally sharp.
The night before the test is not the best time to go out for a few beers with your friends —
headaches and the ASVAB don’t work well together.
Test day
In the military, there is a saying that “If you’re on time, you’re late.” You hear this more than
once in basic training. If you’re taking the ASVAB for the purposes of joining the military
(chances of that are pretty good, if you’re reading this book), then there is a better than
90 percent chance you’ll be taking the test at a Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS),
and your recruiter has arranged your transportation.
At most stations, they conduct the ASVAB test in the afternoon, then set you up with a hotel
room to continue processing (medical examination, job selection, security clearance inter-
view, and so on) early the next morning.
Arrive prepared
Your recruiter should brief you about what to expect and, in some cases, may even drive you
to the MEPS herself. In other cases, depending on how far you live from the closest MEPS,
you may be provided with public transportation. In any case, you want to make sure you’re
on time and ready:
 Eat a light meal before the test (breakfast or lunch, depending on the test time).
You’ll be better able to think when you have some food in your stomach. However,
don’t eat too much. You don’t want to be drowsy during the test. Also, don’t drink too
much water. The test proctors will allow you to use the bathroom if you need to, but if
you need to go in the middle of one of the subtests, the clock doesn’t stop.
 If possible, arrange to arrive at the test site a little early, find a quiet place (such as
your recruiter’s car), and do a ten-minute power-study to get your brain turned on
and tuned up.
 Bring only the paperwork your recruiter gave you and a photo ID. Don’t bring a cal-
culator, your iPod, a backpack, or a sack full of munchies to the testing site. You won’t
be allowed to have them with you.
30
Part I: Taking the AFQT Tour 

 Keep in mind that MEPS is owned and operated by the military, so it doesn’t have
much of a sense of humor when it comes to dress codes. Dress conservatively. Don’t
wear clothes with holes in them or profanity written on them. The only ones at the
MEPS who want to see your underwear are the doctors during the physical exam.
Leave your hat at home, because, under the military civilian dress code, you can’t
wear hats indoors.
Read the directions
Although instructing you to read the directions may seem obvious, when you’re in a hurry,
you can sometimes misread the directions, and that won’t help you get the right answer.
Each subtest has a paragraph or two describing what the subtest covers and instructions on
how to answer the questions.
Understand the question
Take special care to read the questions correctly. Most questions ask something like, “Which
of the following equals 6?” But sometimes, a question may ask, “Which of the following does
not equal 6?” You can easily skip right over the not when you’re reading, and get the question
wrong.
You also have to understand the terms being used. When a math problem asks you to find
the product of two numbers, be sure you know what finding the product means. (It means you
have to multiply the two numbers.) If you add the two numbers together, you arrive at the
wrong answer.
Review all the answer options
Often, people read a question, decide on the answer, glance at the answer options, choose
the option that agrees with their answer, mark it on the answer sheet, and then move on.
Although this approach usually works, it can sometimes lead you astray. On the ASVAB,
you’re supposed to choose the answer that is “most correct.” (Now and then, you do the
opposite and choose the answer that is “least correct.”) Sometimes several answers are rea-
sonably correct for the question at hand, but only one of them is “most correct.” If you don’t
stop to read and review all the answers, you may not choose the one that is “most correct.”
Or, if you review all the answer options, you may realize that you hastily decided upon an
incorrect answer because you misread it.
When in doubt, guess. On the ASVAB, guessing is okay. In fact, it’s encouraged. If you choose
the correct answer, that’s the equivalent of +1 (or more, depending on how the question is
weighted). If you don’t answer a question, that’s the equivalent of 0. If you guess on a ques-
tion and get the question wrong, that’s also the equivalent of 0, not –1. (No penalties here!)
But, if you guess, and you guess correctly, that’s +1 (or more).
In each of the chapters on a particular subtest (Chapters 5, 7, 9, and 11), I give you hints for
making educated guesses that are specific to that topic. But here are some general rules:
 Usually, an answer that has always, all, everyone, never, none, or no one is incorrect.
 If two choices are very similar in meaning, neither of them is probably the correct
choice.
 If two answer options contradict each other, one of them is usually correct.
 The longer the answer, the more likely that it’s the correct answer. The test makers
have to get all those qualifiers in there to make sure that it’s the correct answer and
you can’t find an example to contradict it. If you see phrases like in many cases or fre-
quently, that’s a clue that the test makers are trying to make the answer “most correct.”
31
Chapter 3: The Art of Studying and Test Taking

 Don’t eliminate an answer based on the frequency of that answer coming up. For
example, if Choice B has been the correct answer for the last five questions, don’t
assume that it must be the wrong answer for the question you’re on just because that
would make it six in a row.
 If all else fails, trust your instincts. Often, your first instinct is the correct answer.
The Air Force Senior NCO Academy conducted an in-depth study of several Air Force
multiple-choice test results, taken over several years. They found that when students
changed answers on their answer sheets, they changed from a right to a wrong answer
more than 72 percent of the time! The students’ first instinct was the correct one.

S
uccess in the military has a lot to do with how well
you can read, understand what you’re reading, and
react to what you’ve read. The military loves writing
things down. When you set sail for a military career, you’ll
find all kinds of written instructions to follow. If you don’t
read and follow instructions accurately, you may guide the
sub you’re navigating to Alaska instead of Hawaii.
In this part, I explain why doing well on the AFQT vocabu-
lary and reading subtests is important, and I give you the
tools to accomplish the mission. I include a review of basic
vocabulary and reading information — rock-solid advice
like how to find the main idea of a paragraph and ways to
understand the definition of a vocabulary word based on
context, roots, prefixes, and suffixes.

T
he military is in love with words. Military personnel write almost everything down in
memos, manuals, regulations, standard operating procedures, and policy letters. They
should hire a few For Dummies authors to write these, because the current writers seem to
love fancy words. A hammer isn’t a hammer in the military; it’s a “manually operated nail
impact implement.” The boss of your duty section isn’t “the boss,” or even “the supervisor”;
she’s the “noncommissioned officer in charge” (NCOIC for short).
If you’re going to be successful in the military, you have to have a solid vocabulary, and
that’s why the military includes a Word Knowledge subtest as part of the AFQT score. How
will you be able to obey a regulation, if you don’t know what the words mean? And, trust me,
failure to obey a regulation is a big no-no in the military.
Your score on the Word Knowledge subtest, along with your score on the Paragraph
Comprehension subtest (see Chapters 6 and 7), are used to compute what the military
calls a verbal expression (VE) score. The VE score is then combined with your Arithmetic
Reasoning score (see Chapters 10 and 11) and your Mathematics Knowledge score (see
Chapters 8 and 9) to compute your AFQT score. (For more information on how these
scores combine, turn to Chapter 2.)
The VE score is also used to determine qualification for many military jobs. If you’re inter-
ested in which military jobs require a good VE score, you may want to consider picking up a
copy of the bestselling ASVAB For Dummies, written by your friendly neighborhood ASVAB
expert (me), and published by Wiley.
The good news is that anybody can improve his vocabulary. Ever since you first learned to
talk, you’ve been learning new words and their meanings. In this chapter, I give you some
hints, tips, and techniques that you can use to speed up the process.
Growing Your Vocabulary
Your vocabulary naturally grows throughout your life. Even grumpy old writers like me learn
a new word once in a while through everyday life experiences. But if the ASVAB is staring you
in the face, you may not want to wait for life’s natural process. In the following sections, you
descry omnifarious contrivances to expedite progression of a comprehensive phraseology.
I’m sorry — I got carried away. What I mean is that you’ll find some ways to improve your
vocabulary.

The more you read, the more you learn
People who read a lot have larger vocabularies than people who don’t read much. That
sounds kind of obvious, but I’m sure the government has spent a few thousand dollars fund-
ing studies to confirm this.
It doesn’t matter much what you read, as long as you make it a regular, daily practice. You
don’t have to read Homer or Keats. Leave that to the intellectuals in the Berkeley coffee
shops. Your reading choices could be action-adventure or romance books for enjoyment, the
daily newspaper, magazines, Internet articles and blogs, or even comic books. (If it weren’t
for Batman and Robin, I wouldn’t know what “Zow!” means.)
When reading online, get into the habit of keeping an extra browser window open and pointed
to an online dictionary site, such as www.dictionary.com. That way, if you run into a word
you don’t know, you can quickly highlight it and copy and paste it to the online dictionary.
Talking to people
Other people have vocabularies that differ from yours. If you speak to a variety of people,
and you do it often, you’ll be exposed to a variety of different cultures and occupations, all of
which will expose you to new words.
Carry a small pocket notebook with you wherever you go. That way, when you come across a
new word, you can write it down and look it up in a dictionary later.
Adding words to your vocabulary
Make it a goal to learn at least one new word per day. A great way to do this is to visit or sub-
scribe to one of the many Internet word-of-the-day Web sites. Here are a few suggestions:
 Dictionary.com: You can visit the site daily, or subscribe to the word of the day via
e-mail. Visit http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday.
 Merriam-Webster Online: A new vocabulary word appears every single day. Point your
browser to www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/mwwod.pl.
 A.Word.A.Day: Provided by Wordsmith.org, this free service presents a new word for
you to check out every day, or you can subscribe to its e-mail list. The site is
www.wordsmith.org/words/today.html.
 The New York Times Word of the Day: The New York Times offers a new word every
day, along with an example of how the word was used in a recent New York Times story.
Visit www.nytimes.com/learning/students/wordofday/index.html.
 The Oxford English Dictionary: If you want more than just a word and definition, try
the Oxford English Dictionary word of the day. In addition to definitions, the page also
provides pronunciation, spelling, etymology, and a date chart, showing when the word
was first used. The word of the day is also available by e-mail subscription and RSS
feed. Check out www.oed.com/cgi/display/wotd.
RSS feeds have sprung up all over the Internet. Instead of clicking around all your favorite
sites to check for anything new or interesting, subscribing to an RSS feed allows the site to
send the information directly to you. You can read RSS feeds in a feed reader, like the free
Google Reader (http://reader.google.com).
36
Part II: English as a First Language 

Try to use your new word in conversation a couple of times. That will help you to remember
the word. Writing a few example sentences using new vocabulary will help you remember the
new words in context.
Using puzzles and games to improve 
your vocabulary
A fun way to increase your word knowledge is to do crossword puzzles or play word games.
Scrabble and Mad Libs, for example, are great ways to reinforce new vocabulary words.
Microsoft has launched an online game site, called Club Bing (www.clubbing.com), where
you can play many word games online and even win prizes! What more could you ask for?
Practice your vocabulary, and maybe win an MP3 player to boot! Word games include Banana
Shuffle, Chicktionary, Clink, Flexicon, Seekadoo, and more.
You’re on my list: Word lists
Learning a new word every day won’t do you much good if you forget it a week later. Learning
often requires repetition, and that’s especially true when it comes to memorizing new words.
Keep a list of all the new words you learn and go over that list at least two or three times a
week, until you’re sure the new words have become part of your vocabulary.
Just to get you started, I’ll give you 50 free words (see Table 4-1).

A crossword success story
My late father never finished high school. (That wasn’t
unusual in the 1940s, when many kids dropped out of
school to work on family farms.) However, my dad had the
most extensive vocabulary of anyone I’ve ever known. His
secret? From the age of 20 on, my dad was hooked on the
daily crossword puzzle that was published in the local
newspaper. He did the crossword puzzle every single day
of his life at the morning breakfast table, and if he didn’t
have time to finish, he would save it until he got home from
work. Woe be to the family member who accidently threw
away the paper if Dad hadn’t finished the puzzle that
morning.

Flashing yourself with flashcards
Flashcards have been around for a long time. They’re still in wide use in these days of elec-
tronics and computers because they work. And they work especially well for subjects that
just require simple memorization.
You can make flashcards out of any stiff paper material, like index cards, construction paper,
or card stock.
Take the words from your list and write them on flashcards. Use only one word per card.
Write the word on the front of the card and a short definition on the back.
As far back as 1885, a psychologist named Hermann Ebbinghaus, who specialized in memory
research, published a study that detailed the effective use of flashcards. According to his
rules, you should follow these steps:
1. Review all the cards in the set, looking at each front and back.
Go through the set several times.
2. Test and sort.
Read the front of the card. Try to say what’s written on the back. If you’re wrong, put
the card in a “wrong” pile. Do this for each card, until the cards are sorted into “right”
and “wrong” piles.
3. Review the “wrong” pile.
Read each card in the “wrong” pile, front and back. Go through the “wrong” pile several
times.
4. Test and sort with the “wrong” pile.
Go through the cards of the “wrong” pile, testing yourself with them and sorting them
into “right” and “wrong” piles, just as you did with all the cards in Step 2. Keep working
with the cards of the “wrong” pile until all of them are in the “right” pile.

Chapter 4: Prefabricating a Voluminous Vocabulary

Building a Word from Scratch
Many English words are created from building blocks called roots, prefixes, and suffixes. Not
every word has all three, but many have at least one. The prefix is the part that comes at the
front of a word, the suffix is the part that comes at the end of a word, and the root is the part
that comes in the middle of a word. Think of roots as the base of the word and prefixes and
suffixes as word parts that are attached to the base.
If you don’t know the meaning of a word, you can often break it down into smaller parts and
analyze those part. For instance, introspect is made up from the root spect, which means to
look, and the prefix intro, which means within. Taken together, introspect means “to look
within.” Wasn’t that fun?
If you memorize some of these word parts, you’ll have a better chance of figuring out the
meaning of an unfamiliar word when you see it on the Word Knowledge subtest — and that’s
a good thing. Figuring out the meaning of unfamiliar words is how people with large vocabu-
laries make them even larger. (They look up words in the dictionary, too.)
Rooting around for roots
A root is a word part that serves as the base of a word. If you recognize a root, you can gener-
ally get an idea of what the word means, even if you’re not familiar with it. As Mr. Miyagi said
in Karate Kid, “Root strong, tree grow strong.” All right, Daniel-san, in terms of your vocabu-
lary, think of it this way: If your knowledge of word roots is strong, your vocabulary will be
much larger.
In Table 4-2, I list some common roots. Memorize them. When you sit down to take the
ASVAB, you’ll be glad that you did.

Prefixes and suffixes
A prefix is a group of letters added before a word or base to alter the base’s meaning and
form a new word. In contrast, a suffix is a group of letters added after a word or base.
Prefixes and suffixes are called affixes because they are attached to a root.
Tables 4-3 and 4-4 list some common prefixes and suffixes. Each list has the word part, its
meaning, and one word that uses each word part. Writing down additional words that you
know for each word part will help you memorize the list.

A Word by Any Other Name: 
Synonyms and Antonyms
English is a complicated language. It would probably be easier for you to learn Spanish,
German, or even Korean from scratch than it would be to learn English. How many other
countries do you know that have to teach their own native language throughout all the
school grades (and even college!)?
In the English language there is usually more than one way to say the same thing, even by
swapping just one word. These different words with the same meaning are called synonyms.
Synonyms are different words that have the same or very similar meanings. Funny, amusing,
and comical are synonyms — they all mean the same thing.
In fact, that’s what the Word Knowledge subtest on the ASVAB really does. It tests your abil-
ity to select synonyms for the underlined words contained in the question stem. Look at the
following example.
Perform most nearly means:
(A) eat
(B) dance
(C) execute
(D) sing
The correct answer is C. Execute (to carry out something) is a synonym of perform, which
means the same thing. Although you can perform a dance or perform a song, dance and sing
don’t actually mean the same thing as perform.
When you look up a new word in the dictionary (see the “Adding words to your vocabulary”
section) and add it to your word list (see the “You’re on my list: Word lists” section), you
should include synonyms, because you’re very likely to see these on the Word Knowledge
subtest.
An antonym is a word that has the opposite or nearly opposite meaning of another word.
Smile and frown are antonyms of one another. The test makers often use antonyms as wrong
answers on the Word Knowledge subtest. Knowing antonyms for words not only improves
your chances of narrowing your answer choices, but it will also improve your vocabulary.
For example, if you know that fast is an antonym of slow, and you know what slow means, you
also know what fast means.
43
Chapter 4: Prefabricating a Voluminous Vocabulary

How can you find the synonym of a word (or the antonym, for that matter)? A good place to
start is the dictionary. Many dictionary entries include the abbreviation syn, which means
synonym. The words that follow this abbreviation are synonyms of the entry word. You may
also see the abbreviation ant in an entry. This abbreviation stands for antonym, and the word
or words that follow it mean the opposite of the entry word.
Thesauruses are special dictionaries of synonyms and antonyms. We writers use them all the
time to make us look smarter. There are several thesauruses online that you can use to look
up synonyms for words on your word list. Here are a few:
 Thesaurus.com: http://thesaurus.reference.com
 ARTFL Project: http://humanities.uchicago.edu/forms_unrest/ROGET.html
 Merriam-Webster Online: www.merriam-webster.com
Getting Homogeneous with Homonyms
Some words in the English language are spelled the same but have two or more meanings.
For example, a fluke can mean a fish, the end parts of an anchor, the fins on a whale’s tail, or
a stroke of luck.
Some words are spelled the same, but have different meanings and are often pronounced dif-
ferently. The word bow, meaning a special kind of knot, is pronounced differently from bow,
meaning to bend at the waist. Bow, meaning the front of a boat is pronounced the same as
bow, meaning to bend at the waist, but bow, meaning a weapon is pronounced the same as
bow, meaning a special knot. See why foreigners trying to learn English get frustrated?
Other words are pronounced the same but are spelled differently and mean something differ-
ent. To, too, two, and there, their, and there are examples. All these types of words are collec-
tively known as homonyms.
The last type of homonym is especially important when it comes to the Word Knowledge
subtest of the ASVAB. The test makers won’t try to trick you by having two homonym
answers for words that are spelled the same but have multiple possible answers, but they
will use homonyms that are spelled differently and have different meanings.
Flue most nearly means:
(A) sickness
(B) fly
(C) chimney
(D) None of the above
You may be tempted to choose A, but that would be correct if flu were the test word. The
past tense of fly is flew. The word flue means a chimney pipe.
Table 4-5 shows you a few more examples of common homonyms.

Chapter 5
The Word Knowledge Subtest
In This Chapter
 Looking at typical question types
 Guessing for the best score
 Testing your word knowledge
A
decent vocabulary is essential in the military if you want to get ahead. The military
operates on paperwork, and whether you’re trying to get more supplies (submit neces-
sary logistical requisitions) or get the assignment you want (application for personnel
career-enhancement programs), you need to develop a good vocabulary.
Word Knowledge is what the military calls the vocabulary subtest on the ASVAB. Because
a strong vocabulary is essential to success in the military, the Department of Defense has
made this vocabulary test a part of the all-important AFQT score — the score that deter-
mines whether you’re qualified to join the military service of your choice (see Chapter 2).
The Word Knowledge subtest is different from the other subtests that make up the AFQT in
that, in general, either you know the answer at first glance, or you don’t. People with larger
vocabularies will score better on this subtest than those who have a limited knowledge of
English words and what they mean.
Word knowledge isn’t part of the AFQT score just because the military likes to use big words.
It’s included because words stand for ideas, and the more words you understand, the more
ideas you can understand (and the better you can communicate with others). So, society
(including people in the military) often equates a large vocabulary with intelligence and
success.
Getting Acquainted with the Test Format
The Word Knowledge portion of the ASVAB measures your vocabulary knowledge. It consists
of 35 questions, which usually come in one of two flavors. The first type of question asks for
a straight definition. Your task is to choose the answer closest in meaning to the underlined
word. Look at the following example:
Abatement most nearly means:
(A) encourage
(B) relax
(C) obstruct
(D) terminate
In this case, the correct answer is D, because abatement means putting and end to some-
thing or subsiding.

In the second type of question, you see an underlined word used in the context of a sentence.
Again, your goal is to choose the answer closest in meaning to the underlined word as it is
used in the sentence. For example:
His house was derelict.
(A) solid
(B) run-down
(C) clean
(D) inexpensive
Closest in meaning doesn’t mean the exact same thing. You’re looking for words most similar
in meaning.
In case you’re wondering, the answer is B.
Bumping Up Your Test Score
Usually, on the Word Knowledge subtest, you know the answer or you don’t. Even with that
restriction, however, you can learn a few tricks to get the best score possible.
Keeping an eye on the clock
Like all the ASVAB subtests, the Word Knowledge subtest is timed. You have 11 minutes to
answer the 35 questions on this subtest, which means that you have slightly less than 20 sec-
onds to answer each question. This is plenty of time, as long as you stay focused and don’t
waste time thinking about last night’s date (sorry, I mean “social encounter”).
If you’re taking the computerized version of the ASVAB, your remaining time will be displayed
on the computer screen. If you’re taking the paper version of the test, a clock will be clearly
visible in the room, and the test proctor will post the start and stop time for the subtest on a
blackboard or whiteboard.
Watching out for the evil homonym
A homonym is a word with more than one meaning (see Chapter 4). The word may be spelled
the same or it may be spelled differently, but either way it’s pronounced the same.
There aren’t any trick questions on the ASVAB. In other words, the test won’t present you
two legitimate answers and ask you to try to decide which one is the “best.” However,
homonyms can still trip you up if you don’t pay attention. Look at the following example:
Bate most nearly means:
(A) tease
(B) lessen
(C) treasure
(D) pregnant
48
Part II: English as a First Language 

Bate and bait are homonyms. They are two words that sound the same, but they are spelled
differently and mean different things. Bait means to torment or tease (it’s also used to entice
fish), and bate means to make less.
Some homonyms are spelled the same but have different meanings. You won’t see multiple
correct definitions on the Word Knowledge subtest when you’re doing a direct definition
problem, but you may see such multiple, correct definitions when the word is used in the
context of a sentence. For example:
Jack tied a bow around his neck.
(A) knot
(B) weapon
(C) ship front
(D) respect
All the answer choices are proper definitions for the word bow. However, only one choice
makes sense for bow in the context of the sentence. It just wouldn’t make sense for Jack to
tie a weapon, front of a ship, or respect around his neck.
When in doubt, guess
Sometimes on the Word Knowledge subtest, you just don’t know the answer. In that case,
don’t leave it blank. (You can’t leave answers blank on the computerized version of the test —
just the paper version.) There are no penalties for wrong answers on the ASVAB. If you leave
the answer blank, you have a 0 percent chance of getting it right. But if you make a wild guess,
you have a 25 percent chance of stumbling upon the right answer.
Keep in mind that, although you may know the word in the question, you may not know one
or more of the words in the multiple-choice answers. If this is the case, use process of elimi-
nation to narrow your choices. Eliminate the words you know aren’t correct, and guess which
of the remaining words is most likely correct.
Before making a wild guess, take a few seconds and look at the word from a different per-
spective. You may find that you know the word after all — just in a different form. In English,
one root word can be changed slightly to perform all sorts of roles — it can act as a noun, a
verb, an adjective, or an adverb with just a little modification. So, if you know what the root
word attach means, you can figure out what the word attachment means. If you know adher-
ent, you can deduce what adherence means. (You can find much more information on this
topic in Chapter 4.)
You can use root word clues to identify unfamiliar words on the ASVAB. Say you run across
the word beneficent on the Word Knowledge test:
Beneficent most nearly means:
(A) kind
(B) beautiful
(C) unhappy
(D) troubled
49
Chapter 5: The Word Knowledge Subtest

If you don’t have a clue what the word beneficent means, all is not lost. Take a closer look.
What other word starting with the letters benefi do you know? How about the word benefit?
A benefit is something that helps or aids, so it would be a good bet that the word beneficent
is related to helping or aiding. So when you look over the possible choices, you can choose
the one that has something to do with helping.
But wait. None of the answers say help or aid. Now what? Just use process of elimination. If
something is helpful (beneficent), it probably isn’t troubled or unhappy. It may be beautiful,
but more likely, it’s kind. So the best answer would be A — and it just so happens that that’s
correct!
Trying On Some Sample Questions
Now you’re ready to pit your skills against the Word Knowledge section of the ASVAB. Try
these sample questions to see how you do. They’re similar to what you’ll see on the ASVAB.
1. Bestial most nearly means:
(A) playful
(B) animal-like
(C) tantalizing
(D) pregnant
The correct answer is B. Bestial is an adjective that means having animal characteristics.
Noting the similarity between the words bestial and beast could lead you in the right direc-
tion with this question.
2. Tim bombarded the school board with questions about the new program.
(A) asked
(B) pleaded with
(C) assailed
(D) scheduled
The correct answer is C. Used as a verb, bombard means to overwhelm or assail. Observing
that the root word is bomb should give you a clue as to the meaning of bombarded.
3. Malignant most nearly means:
(A) tumor
(B) angry
(C) kind
(D) evil
The correct answer is D. Malignant is an adjective that means evil or harmful. You may have
been tempted to select A, because you may have heard of a malignant tumor, but tumor and
malignant don’t mean the same thing.
50
Part II: English as a First Language 

4. Bernard wanted to ask a lawyer if his friend’s investment idea was licit.
(A) legal
(B) profitable
(C) illegal
(D) sensible
The correct answer is A. Licit is an adjective that means lawful. Although you may not have
been familiar with the word licit, chances are good that you’ve come across the opposite-
meaning word, illicit, and you probably know that it means illegal. So, you can deduce that
licit means the opposite of illegal, or legal.
5. Achromatic most nearly means:
(A) automatic
(B) tasty
(C) colorless
(D) manual
The correct answer is C. Achromatic is an adjective that means having no color. If you knew
that the word root chrom refers to color and that the prefix a- means without, you could
figure out that achromatic means without color.
6. Peggy was angry over the umbrage she received from her brother.
(A) gift
(B) argument
(C) hurt
(D) dead flowers
The correct answer is C. Used as a noun, umbrage means insult or feeling of hurt. Although
the connection here is a bit out there, both umbrage and the more familiar word umbrella
share the root meaning of shadow. Offended umbrage is a shadowy feeling. Umbrellas create
shadows. Really, that’s the connection.
7. Wry most nearly means:
(A) smile
(B) distorted
(C) angry
(D) happy
The correct answer is B. Wry is an adjective that means crooked or twisted.
8. Melissa was justifiably proud of her recent abstinence.
(A) grades
(B) sobriety
(C) trustworthiness
(D) awards
The correct answer is B. Abstinence is a noun that means the willful avoidance of a substance
such as alcohol or drugs.
51
Chapter 5: The Word Knowledge Subtest

9. Voluble most nearly means:
(A) fluent
(B) taciturn
(C) funny
(D) religious
The correct answer is A. Voluble is an adjective that means fluent or glib.
10. Lyle’s landlord instructed him to vacate the apartment.
(A) paint
(B) leave
(C) clean
(D) sell
The correct answer is B. Vacate is a verb that means to give up occupancy of a location.
Word roots are key here. A vacation involves leaving your normal place of residence. When
people evacuate an area, they leave that area. A vacuum is created when matter leaves a
given area.

Chapter 6
Reading for Comprehension
In This Chapter
 Picking out points and subpoints
 Understanding what you’ve read
 Becoming a better reader
T
he military services want their members not only to be able to read, but also to under-
stand what they’re reading. This is known as “reading comprehension,” but the military
being the military, calls its version “paragraph comprehension” and includes it as one of the
ASVAB subtests that comprise your AFQT score.
Why does the military place so much importance on reading comprehension? Quite simple:
Miscommunication has been the leading cause of almost every major military accident or
battlefield disaster in history.
The military runs on paperwork. A former Air Force vice chief of staff once commented that
he had looked at 13,000 pieces of paper in a five-day period. Granted, you won’t see quite so
much correspondence as a newly enlisted member, but you will have to read and understand
your share of memos, policy letters, regulations, manuals, and forms. In fact, as an enlisted
member, your promotions are based, in part, on how well you can read, comprehend, and
retain information from written material. And, the higher you get in rank, the more paper-
work you’ll see.
Reading comprehension involves several skills that anyone can develop with practice. To
thoroughly understand what you read, you must develop the ability to recognize the main
idea, recall details, and make inferences about what you’ve read. The information in this
chapter will help you improve your reading comprehension skills, making it possible for you
to ace the Paragraph Comprehension subtest of the ASVAB.
Pointers about Points
When someone writes something, he almost always is trying to make a point. This message
is called the main point or principal idea of the writing. The paragraph or passage may also
contain information that supports or reinforces the main point; these little gems are called
subpoints.

Picking out the main point
The main point is the most important part of a paragraph or passage. It’s the primary theme
that the writer wants you to understand. In many cases, the main point is stated simply. In
other cases, it may be implied by the writer, rather than stated directly.
Quite often, the main point of the paragraph or passage is contained in the first sentence.
You may recall from school that your English teacher referred to this sentence as the topic
sentence. Sometimes the main point is rephrased or summarized in the last sentence of the
passage. For example, in the following passage, the main idea is stated in the first sentence:
U.S. Military forces will increasingly be called upon in the immediate future for peaceful
military-to-military contacts, humanitarian intervention, peace support, and other non-
traditional roles. The end of the Cold War transformed U.S. national security. The United
States entered the 21st century with unprecedented prosperity and opportunities
threatened by complex dangers. Problems associated with fostering a stable global
system require the U.S. military to play an essential role in building coalitions and shap-
ing the international environment in ways that protect and promote U.S. interests.
The main point is stated clearly in the very first sentence: “U.S. Military forces will increas-
ingly be called upon in the immediate future for peaceful military-to-military contacts,
humanitarian intervention, peace support, and other nontraditional roles.” The sentences
that follow are subpoints that help to clarify and emphasize the main point of the paragraph.
Sometimes the main point isn’t found in the first sentence. Look at the passage again, slightly
reworded:
The end of the Cold War transformed U.S. national security. The United States entered
the 21st century with unprecedented prosperity and opportunities threatened by com-
plex dangers. Problems associated with fostering a stable global system require the U.S.
military to play an essential role in building coalitions and shaping the international
environment in ways that protect and promote U.S. interests. A key assumption is that
U.S. Military forces will increasingly be called upon in peaceful military-to-military con-
tacts, humanitarian intervention, peace support, and other nontraditional roles.
The main point of the paragraph remains the same, but it isn’t stated until the last sentence.
Sometimes the main point isn’t clearly stated but rather implied. Take a look at the following
paragraph:
The plane landed at 9 p.m. The children were disappointed that new security rules pre-
vented them from meeting their father at the gate. They waited with their mother in the
car outside the airport doors, amidst dozens of other people in vehicles, there for simi-
lar purposes. With each passing moment, their excitement grew. Finally, the automatic
doors opened, and he walked out. “Dad! Hey, Dad!”, the excited children yelled.
Though it’s not directly stated, the main point of this paragraph is obviously that the chil-
dren’s father is coming home.
Take another look at the previous passage. When trying to determine the main point of a
paragraph, ask yourself the following:
 Who or what is this paragraph about? A father returning to his family.
 What aspect of this subject is the author talking about? The moments before and the
moment of the father’s appearing at the airport doors.
 What is the author trying to get across about this aspect of the subject? The drama of
the father’s reunion with his family.
54
Part II: English as a First Language 

Simplifying subpoints
Most writers don’t stick to just one point. If they did, most paragraphs could be reduced to
just one sentence. But it doesn’t work that way. Writers usually try to reinforce their main
points by providing details. These details, or subpoints, may include facts or statistics, or
they may be descriptions that support the main point of the passage. Subpoints help you see
what the author is saying. Take, for instance, the following passage:
For the purpose of drill, Air Force organizations are divided into elements, flights,
squadrons, groups, and wings. The “rule of two” applies (that is, an element must consist of
at least two people, a flight must consist of at least two elements, and so on). Usually, an
element consists of between eight and ten people, and a flight has six or eight elements.
Drill consists of certain movements by which the flight or squadron is moved in an orderly
manner from one formation to another or from one place to another.
Notice how the writer uses the second, third, and fourth sentences to explain in detail how
Air Force organizations are divided for the purposes of drill. These supporting details are
subpoints.
In addition, look for signal words in the passage — words like again, also, as well as, further-
more, moreover, and significantly. These signal words may call your attention to supporting
facts.
Analyzing What You’ve Read
Understanding what you read involves more than just picking out main points and subpoints.
To analyze a paragraph, you need to examine a passage carefully and in detail, so as to iden-
tify causes, key factors, and possible results. Analyzing a passage requires you to draw con-
clusions from what you’ve read and understand relationships between the ideas presented in
the text.
Say what? What does that passage mean?
By drawing conclusions about the meaning of a passage, you reach new ideas that the author
implies but doesn’t come right out and state. You must analyze the information the author
presents in order to make inferences from what you’ve read. What conclusions can you infer
from the following paragraph?
The local school district is facing a serious budgetary crisis. The state, suffering a rev-
enue shortfall of more than $600 million, has cut funding to the district by $18.7 million.
Already, 65 teachers have been laid off, and more layoffs are expected.
Can you conclude that the local school district really stinks? Possibly, but that’s not the
point I’m trying to make. Although the author doesn’t come straight out and say so, you can
draw the conclusion that if the state revenue shortfall could somehow be corrected — by
increasing state sales tax or income tax, for example — the local school district’s budgetary
crisis could be resolved. The author never actually makes this point in the paragraph. But by
using reason and logic, you can draw this conclusion from the facts presented.
When analyzing a passage, leave your baggage at the door. For example, you may not like the
current governor, but nothing in the passage suggests that the writer supports electing a new
governor to solve the budget problem.
55
Chapter 6: Reading for Comprehension

Say it again, Sam: Paraphrasing
Paraphrasing means to rewrite the passage using your own words. This strategy is often
useful when you’re trying to understand a complex idea. Putting it in your own words can
help you understand the main idea, which can, in turn, help you discover information that
may not be stated directly. It can also be helpful in making inferences and drawing conclu-
sions from the information provided. Look at the following short passage:
On-the-job training (OJT) is often the most effective method of training, because the
employer tailors the training to meet the specific job requirements. OJT can be as casual
as giving a few pointers to a new worker or as formal as a fully structured training pro-
gram with timetables and specified subjects.
How would you paraphrase this passage? If you wrote something like the following, you’d be
on the right track:
Some OJT programs involve a formal lesson plan, while others are simply telling a new
employee what to do and how to do it. OJT works well because new employees can be
taught what they need to do the specific job.
Paraphrasing is just saying the same thing using different words. In basic training, your drill
instructor may say, “You really need to work on your running time,” or he may say “Get the
%$@* lead out of your pants and run faster!” Both mean the same thing.
Improving Your Reading Comprehension Skills
Some people read and comprehend better than others, but one thing is for certain: You’re
not born with the ability to read — it’s something you learn. Like almost anything that is
learned, you can use proven techniques to help you learn to do it better:
 Read more, and watch TV less.
 Practice skimming and scanning.
 Learn to identify the main ideas and the all-important subpoints.
 Work on the meanings of strange or difficult words.
 Practice paraphrasing.
 Reflect on what you’ve read.
Taking the time to read
Joseph Addison once noted that “Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body.” My
first tae kwon do instructor has been practicing his art for 52 years. He is very, very good at
it. I have a good friend who has spent every day of his working life for the past 30 years work-
ing on air-conditioning systems. He can take your air conditioner apart and put it back
together blindfolded in less time than it takes you to say, “I’m hot.”
The point is that anything gets better with practice. If you don’t read well, the chances are
good that you don’t read much. You don’t need a $4-million government-funded study
(although I’m sure there are a few) to know that people who read a lot are more likely to be
better readers than people who don’t read so much.
56
Part II: English as a First Language 

If you learn to read for fun, you’ll automatically read more, and I guarantee that your reading
skills will improve immeasurably after a relatively short time. So, how do you learn to read
for fun? Simple: Choose reading material in subject areas that interest you.
You don’t have to pick up A Tale of Two Cities or War and Peace. You can start with the news-
paper, a biography of a person you admire, or magazines you find at the library. Personally,
I like For Dummies books. If you devote at least one hour a day to improving your reading
comprehension, you’ll see results fast — maybe within a month or so.
Skimming and scanning
There are different styles of reading for different situations. The technique you choose will
depend on the purpose for reading. For example, you may be reading for enjoyment, to find
information, or to complete a task. If you’re reading for enjoyment, you usually read and
savor every word. However, in other situations — such as when you’re just trying to find the
main ideas or looking up specific information — you may not want to read every single word.
Skimming
You can skim to quickly identify the main ideas of a text. For example, most people don’t
read a newspaper word for word. Instead, they skim through the text to see if the article may
be something they want to read in more depth. Most people can skim at a speed three to four
times faster than normal reading. Skimming is especially useful if you have lots of material to
read in a limited amount of time.
Here are some points to keep in mind when you practice skimming:
 If the article or passage has a title, read it. It’s often the shortest possible summary of
the content.
 Read the first sentence or paragraph. This introductory text often consists of the main
point(s).
 If there are subheadings, read each one, looking for relationships among them.
 Look for clue words that answer who, where, how, why, and when.
 Pay attention to qualifying adjectives, such as best, worst, most, and so on.
 Look for typographical clues such as boldface, italics, underlining, or asterisks.
Scanning
Scanning involves moving your eyes quickly down the page seeking specific words and
phrases. When you scan, you must be willing to skip over several lines of text without actu-
ally reading and understanding them.
Scanning is a useful technique when looking for keywords or specific ideas. For example,
when you look up a name in a phonebook, you’re probably using the scanning technique. In
most cases, you know what you’re looking for, so you’re concentrating on finding a particu-
lar answer.
When scanning a document:
 Keep in mind what you’re scanning for. If you keep a picture in your mind, the infor-
mation is much more likely to jump out at you from among all the other printed words.
 Anticipate what form the information is likely to appear in. Will it be numbers?
Proper nouns?
57
Chapter 6: Reading for Comprehension

 Let your eyes run over several lines of print at a time.
 When you find the information that you’re looking for, read the entire sentence.
Skimming and scanning are useful techniques for many of the Paragraph Comprehension
problems. I talk more about this in Chapter 7.
Looking for the main ideas and subpoints
There wouldn’t be much purpose to reading if you just let your eyes wander over the words
without walking away with some sense of what the author was talking about. The author’s
ideas are included in the main point and subpoints of the writing. You need to practice
extracting this information from your reading material. See the “Pointers about Points” sec-
tion, earlier in this chapter.
Building your vocabulary
It’s hard to understand what you’re reading if you don’t understand the individual words.
Effective reading comprehension involves developing a solid vocabulary. Use the techniques
in Chapter 4 to strengthen your vocabulary, and you’ll simultaneously improve your reading
comprehension skills. The two skills go hand in hand.
When practicing reading, try not to look up new words in a dictionary right away. Stopping to
look up words often impairs your concentration and lessens your ability to comprehend
what you’ve read.
Instead, start by trying to puzzle out the meaning of a new word by looking at the context in
which the word is used in the sentence or phrase. For example, take the following passage:
It had been three days since the shipwreck, and Tammy was unable to find food or much
drinkable water. At that point, she would have done anything to get off that wretched
island.
You can derive several important clues about the meaning of the word wretched based on its
context in the passage. Obviously, Tammy is not having a very good time, nor does she find
the island to be a very pleasant environment. Therefore, you can surmise that wretched has
something to do with unpleasantness.
Paraphrasing
Putting the text in your own words can help you understand what the writer is talking about.
I talk more extensively about this in the “Say it again, Sam: Paraphrasing” section, earlier in
this chapter.
You probably won’t have time on the Paragraph Comprehension subtest of the ASVAB to
rewrite passages on your scratch paper. But, by practicing the technique while you’re practic-
ing your reading comprehension skills, you’ll develop the ability to paraphrase in your mind.
58

Remembering by reflecting
Reflecting simply means thinking about what you’ve read. If you take a few minutes to think
about it, you’re much more likely to remember it. Did you enjoy the passage or article? Did
you find it interesting? Do you agree or disagree with the author’s views?
Thinking about what you’ve read may cause you to learn something.
Speaking about Speed
There are dozens of speed-reading courses, software, and online programs that absolutely
guarantee, without qualification, to turn you into a reading speed demon. However, if your
goal is to score well on the Paragraph Comprehension subtest of the ASVAB, I recommend
you save your money.
The Paragraph Comprehension subtest is not a speed-reading test. You have 13 minutes to
read between eight and ten short paragraphs and answer 15 questions. This is plenty of time
for most people. There are no extra points on this test for finishing early. If you blaze through
the test in six minutes, and get all the questions right, your score will be the same as if you
took the entire allotted time. Instead, concentrate on improving your comprehension skills.
That’s what this subtest is all about: How well do you understand what you’ve read?
If you’re still worried about your reading speed, just remember: The more you read, the
better (and faster) you’ll get at it. Read to comprehend by using the information in this chap-
ter, and your speed will automatically get faster as you practice.

T
here are only 15 questions on the Paragraph Comprehension subtest — the fewest of any
of the ASVAB subtests. However, it’s one of the most important subtests of the ASVAB,
because the military uses this test (along with the Word Knowledge subtest; see Chapters 4
and 5) to compute your verbal expression (VE) score, which, in turn, is an important part of
your AFQT score. (If you want to see how these scores combine, turn to Chapter 2.)
This subtest is nothing more than a reading comprehension test, much like many of the read-
ing tests you took in school. You’re asked to read a short passage (a paragraph), and then
answer one to four questions about information contained in that paragraph. Unfortunately,
you probably won’t find the reading to be very interesting. No passages from Harry Potter or
spacemen shooting ray guns here. You’re more likely to read about the corn crop harvest
rates in Nebraska or the principles of time management. The key is to stay focused. There
are, after all, only 15 questions, and the paragraphs aren’t that long.
In addition to being an important part of your AFQT score, a large percentage of military jobs
require a solid score on this subtest. If you’re interested in which military jobs require you to
score well on the Paragraph Comprehension subtest, might I humbly recommend you trot
down to your neighborhood bookstore and ask for a copy of my best-selling ASVAB For
Dummies (Wiley)? You’ll be glad you did.
The Test Format: Types of Questions
The Paragraph Comprehension subtest requires you to read a short paragraph, and then
answer one or more multiple-choice questions about what you’ve read. These questions can
generally be broken down into one of four types, which I like to call the treasure hunt, getting
the point, dictionary, and deep thinking.
The treasure hunt
Treasure hunt questions require you to find specific information within the paragraph. The
good thing about this type of question is that, by employing the scanning techniques in
Chapter 6, you can often find the answer without having to read the entire paragraph. Try
the following example:

A new study has found that 21 percent of people arrested in the United States for driving
under the influence were arrested again for the same crime within five years. The study, com-
missioned by the U.S. Department of Justice, analyzed recidivism rates for DUI between 2002
and 2007. During this period, there were more than 930,000 arrests for DUI. Of these, 195,300,
or 21 percent, were arrested again for violating DUI laws a second time within the established
timeframe. The study found that 34 percent of the repeat offenses occurred within six
months of the original arrest.
How many people were arrested for DUI more than once between 2002 and 2007?
(A) 930,000
(B) 195,300
(C) 210,000
(D) None of the above
By using the scanning technique and letting your eyes quickly scan through the paragraph,
you’ll notice that all the large numbers are contained in the middle. If you stop and read the
two sentences that include large numbers, you’ll quickly find the answer to the question: B.
Sometimes the answer isn’t so obvious, and you have to dig a little deeper to find the treas-
ure. Take the following question, for example:
George Armstrong Custer (December 5, 1839–June 25, 1876) was a U.S. Army officer and cav-
alry commander in the Civil War and the American Indian Wars. At the start of the Civil War,
Custer was a cadet at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, and his class’s graduation was
accelerated so that they could enter the war. Early in the Gettysburg Campaign, Custer’s
association with cavalry commander Major General Alfred Pleasonton earned him a promo-
tion ate the age of 23 from first lieutenant to brigadier general of volunteers. By the end of
the Civil War (April 9, 1865), Custer had achieved the rank of major general of volunteers but
was reduced to his permanent grade of captain in the regular army when the troops were
sent home.
How old was George Custer at the end of the Civil War?
(A) 24
(B) 25
(C) 26
(D) 34
The answer is still right there in the paragraph, but you have to use a little judgment (and
math) to find it. General Custer was born on December 5, 1839 (which you can find in the
first sentence) and the Civil War ended on April 9, 1865 (which the last sentence tells you).
Therefore, Custer was 25 years old at the end of the war. (He didn’t turn 26 until December of
that year.)
Getting the point
This type of question asks you to discern the main topic or main point of the paragraph (see
Chapter 6 for more information). When you look for the main point, skimming the paragraph,
rather than reading it in its entirety, is often helpful (again, see Chapter 6). Try this one on
for size:
62
Part II: English as a First Language 

The farmers’ market reopened the second weekend of May. Amid the asparagus and flowers,
shoppers chatted about the return of temperatures in the seventies. Across the street, chil-
dren (and their dogs) were playing Frisbee in the park. Finally, spring had come to town.
What is the main point of the passage?
(A) The farmers’ market has reopened.
(B) Children like playing Frisbee.
(C) Spring had come to town.
(D) Shoppers were chatting.
In this paragraph, you may think that the farmers’ market reopening is the main point, but
the other information about the temperature and the kids playing Frisbee tells you that the
main idea is something a bit broader than the market opening. The main idea is stated in the
last sentence: “Finally, spring had come to town.”
When skimming for the main point of a paragraph, start with the first sentence, and then
read the last sentence. The main idea is often contained in one of these sentences.
Dictionary
Much like the Word Knowledge subtest (covered in Chapters 4 and 5), this type of question
requires you to define a word as used in the context of the passage. The correct definition
that the question is looking for can be the most common meaning of the word, or it can be a
less well-known meaning of the word.
In either case, you have to read the passage, make sure you understand how the word is being
used, and select the answer option that is closest in meaning to the word as it’s used in the
passage. Consider this example:
In the 18th century, it was common for sailors to be pressed into service in Britain. Young
men found near seaports could be kidnapped, drugged, or otherwise hauled aboard a ship
and made to work doing menial chores. They were not paid for their service, and they were
given just enough food to keep them alive.
In this passage, pressed means:
(A) hired
(B) ironed
(C) enticed
(D) forced
The correct answer is D. The descriptions of the conditions these sailors found themselves
in should help you decide that they weren’t hired or enticed; ironed is one meaning of the
word pressed, but it isn’t correct in this context.
63
Chapter 7: The Paragraph Comprehension Subtest

Deep thinking
If the paragraph comprehension questions on the ASVAB simply asked you to scan a passage
and find the main point or supporting details, it would be a pretty simple test. But the sub-
test goes beyond that. In order to properly answer some of the questions on the test, you’ll
be required to analyze what you’ve read and draw conclusions.
The conclusion — which may be called an inference or implication — must be reasonably
based on what the passage says. You have to use good judgment when deciding what conclu-
sions can be logically drawn from what you’ve read.
Try this example:
One of the main reasons motorcyclists are killed in crashes is that the motorcycle itself pro-
vides virtually no protection in a crash. For example, approximately 80 percent of reported
motorcycle crashes result in injury or death; a comparable figure for automobiles is about
20 percent.
Safe motorcycle riding means:
(A) always wearing a helmet
(B) using premium gas
(C) selecting the most expensive motorcycle
(D) always riding with a buddy
The correct answer is A. The author didn’t specifically state in the passage that wearing a
helmet is important, but you can infer the correct answer because the author gives the
reason for fatalities: Motorcycles themselves offer virtually no protection in a crash. Based
on the information provided in the passage, you can logically conclude that even the small
degree of protection offered by a helmet increases the safety of riding motorcycles. None of
the other choices is as closely connected to the idea of safety.
Planning Your Attack
The best way to score well on the Paragraph Comprehension subtest is to improve your
reading comprehension skills by following the advice I give in Chapter 6. However, there are
also a few things you can do on test day to make sure you score as high as possible:
 Watch the time. As with all the ASVAB subtests, this is a timed test. You have 13 min-
utes to read through approximately 9 paragraphs and answer 15 questions. This is
plenty of time, so you shouldn’t feel rushed. But still, you don’t have time for day-
dreaming either.
 If you don’t know the answer or you run out of time, guess. Guessing is always better
than not guessing. You have a chance of getting the correct answer if you guess. So, if
you’re running out of time on the test, or you’re not sure if you can identify the main
idea of a passage, take a guess.
 Question first, read later. In ASVAB For Dummies, I recommend reading the entire para-
graph first, before looking at the question. Many reading comprehension test experts now
recommend the opposite. If the question asks you to find specific information or discern
the main idea of the paragraph, skimming or scanning (see Chapter 6) can save loads of
time. Read the question first, so that you can best decide what reading technique to use.
64
Part II: English as a First Language 

 Take it one question at a time. Some passages have more than one question associ-
ated with them, but look at only one question at a time.
 Understand each question. What is the question asking you to do? Are you supposed
to find the main point? Draw a conclusion? Find a word that is nearest in meaning?
Make sure you know what the question is asking before you choose among the answer
options. This tip may seem obvious, but when you’re in a hurry, you can make mis-
takes by misunderstanding the questions.
 Read each answer option carefully. Don’t just select the first answer that seems right.
Remember: On the Paragraph Comprehension subtest, one answer is often “most
right” while others are “almost right.” You want to choose the “most right” answer,
not the “almost right” answer. And to do that, you have to read all the answers.
 Check your baggage at the door. Answer each question based on the passage, not
your own opinions or views on the topic.
 Don’t choose ambiguous answer options. They’re incorrect 99.99 times out of 100.
(Oh, heck, call it 100 times out of 100.) If an answer strikes you as not quite true but not
totally false, that answer is incorrect. Those nasty ASVAB test makers have put it there
to throw you off. Don’t give them the satisfaction of falling for their trap!
Sample Test Questions
Time for you to put all the great advice I provide in this chapter and Chapter 6 to good use.
(You can see that I’m not usually accused of being too modest.) Quiz yourself on the follow-
ing sample test questions to see if your reading comprehension is up to speed.
“First, stick to one excuse. Thus, if a tradesman, with whom your social relations are
slight, should chance to find you taking coppers from his till, you may possibly explain
that you are interested in Numismatics and are a Collector of Coins; and he may possi-
bly believe you. But if you tell him afterwards that you pitied him for being overloaded
with unwieldy copper discs, and were in the act of replacing them by a silver sixpence
of your own, this further explanation, so far from increasing his confidence in your
motives, will (strangely enough) actually decrease it. And if you are so unwise as to be
struck by yet another brilliant idea, and tell him that the pennies were all bad pennies,
which you were concealing to save him from a police prosecution for coining, the
tradesman may even be so wayward as to institute a police prosecution himself.”
—G. K. Chesterton
1. The author is giving the reader advice about:
(A) collecting coins
(B) stealing
(C) dealing with tradesmen
(D) becoming a police officer
The correct answer is B. Mr. Chesterton is expounding on how sticking to one excuse may
help you if you’re caught taking coins from the tradesman’s till.

Chapter 7: The Paragraph Comprehension Subtest

Ethics are standards by which one should act based on values. Values are core beliefs
such as duty, honor, and integrity that motivate attitudes and actions. Not all values are
ethical values (integrity is — happiness is not). Ethical values relate to what is right and
wrong and, thus, take precedence over nonethical values when making ethical decisions.
2. According to the paragraph, values can best be defined as:
(A) ethics
(B) stealing
(C) core beliefs
(D) right and wrong
The correct answer is C. The second sentence defines the word values.
Although the average consumer replaces the tires on his or her automobile every 50,000
miles, steel-belted radials can last for 60,000 miles. However, they must be properly
maintained. The tires must be inflated to the correct air pressure at all times, and tires
must be rotated and balanced according to a routine maintenance schedule. The tread
should be checked for correct depth regularly.
3. How long can steel-belted radials last?
(A) 25,000 miles
(B) 50,000 miles
(C) 60,000 miles
(D) No one knows.
The correct answer is C. If you used the scanning technique explained in Chapter 6, you
would have found this answer quickly.
4. According to the passage, proper tire maintenance does not include:
(A) keeping tires properly inflated
(B) balancing and rotating tires
(C) checking the tread
(D) checking the lug nuts
The correct answer is D. This is a negative question that requires extra care in answering. A
negative question asks you for something that is not true, or not included in the paragraph. If
you’re rushed or in a hurry, you can easily misread the question.
Some people argue that baking is an art, but Chef Debra Dearhorn says that baking is a
science. She says that if you follow a recipe carefully, assembling the ingredients accu-
rately, cooking at the specified temperature for the specified period of time, your cook-
ies will always turn out right. Chef Dearborn says the best baking is like the best
experiment — anyone can duplicate it.
5. In this passage, the word assembling most nearly means:
(A) measuring
(B) putting together
(C) buying
(D) storing
66
Part II: English as a First Language 

The correct answer is B. Although measuring is something you do when baking, it doesn’t
“most nearly” mean the same thing as assembling. Putting together does.
6. According to the passage, a person who can’t make a decent batch of cookies:
(A) should get out of the kitchen
(B) is an artist
(C) isn’t following the recipe carefully
(D) is Chef Dearborn
The correct answer is C. The passage states that if you follow a recipe carefully, your cookies
will always turn out right.
Boiler technicians operate main and auxiliary boilers. They maintain and repair all
parts, including pressure fittings, valves, pumps, and forced-air blowers. Technicians
may have to lift or move heavy equipment. They may have to stoop and kneel and work
in awkward positions.
7. According to this job description, a good candidate for this job would be
(A) a person with management experience
(B) an individual with keen eyesight
(C) a person who is not mechanically minded
(D) a person who is physically fit
The correct answer is D. Although the passage doesn’t say, “This job requires a physically fit
person,” the duties listed imply that this is so. A person with management experience or keen
eyesight may make a good candidate, but the passage doesn’t list these traits as requirements
for the job. A person who is not mechanically minded may not have the knowledge necessary
to maintain and repair boilers and all their parts. This leaves D, and it’s true that a person who
is physically fit would be a good choice for the job.
In June 2004, the city council passed a resolution requiring all residents to paint their
address numbers on their homes using a bright color. This was done to assist firemen,
police, and paramedics in finding an address during an emergency. In August, 300 resi-
dences were randomly sampled and it was found that 150 had complied with the new
ordinance.
8. According to the above passage, what percentage of the randomly sampled residences had
complied with the new ordinance?
(A) 10 percent
(B) 20 percent
(C) 50 percent
(D) 60 percent
The correct answer is C. The author didn’t specifically say that 50 percent had not complied,
but she included enough information in the passage so that you can calculate it on your own.
The younger the child, the trickier using medicine is. Children under 2 years shouldn’t
be given any over-the-counter (OTC) drug without a doctor’s approval. Your pediatri-
cian can tell you how much of a common drug, like acetaminophen (Tylenol), is safe for
babies. Prescription drugs also can work differently in children than adults. Some barbi-
turates, for example, which make adults feel sluggish, will make a child hyperactive.
67
Chapter 7: The Paragraph Comprehension Subtest

Amphetamines, which stimulate adults, can calm children. When giving any drug to a
child, watch closely for side effects. If you’re not happy with what’s happening with your
child, don’t assume that everything’s okay. Always be suspicious. It’s better to make the
extra calls to the doctor or nurse practitioner than to have a bad reaction to a drug. And
before parents dole out OTC drugs, they should consider whether they’re truly neces-
sary. Americans love to medicate—perhaps too much. A study published in the October
1994 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association found that more than half
of all mothers surveyed had given their 3-year-olds an OTC medication in the previous
month. Not every cold needs medicine. Common viruses run their course in seven to
ten days with or without medication. Although some OTC medications can sometimes
make children more comfortable and help them eat and rest better, others may trigger
allergic reactions or changes for the worse in sleeping, eating, and behavior. Antibiotics,
available by prescription, don’t work at all on cold viruses.
9. A common problem in America is:
(A) over-medication
(B) parents not heeding the advice of their doctors
(C) OTC drugs not requiring a prescription
(D) the cost of prescription medication
The correct answer is A. The 11th and 12th sentences in the passage suggest that Americans
probably medicate too much.
10. When a parent is in doubt about giving a child medication, it’s best to:
(A) speak with a pharmacist
(B) call a doctor or nurse practitioner
(C) read the label closely
(D) research the side effects
The correct answer is B. The passage states that it’s better to make the extra calls than to
have a bad reaction to a drug. While the other choices may be good advice, they are not
stated or implied in the paragraph.

azarus Long, a fictional character created by Robert A. Heinlein, once said, “Anyone
who cannot cope with mathematics is not fully human. At best, he is a tolerable subhu-
man who has learned to wear shoes, bathe, and not make messes in the house.”
Perhaps Mr. Heinlein’s observation is a little harsh. Some people seem to be born mathemati-
cians, while others struggle with it. The fact remains, however, that the military seems to
agree with Robert. You can’t join the military without proving that you know the fundamen-
tals of math.
Fully 50 percent of your AFQT score is based on your ability to solve math problems. And if you
read Chapter 2, you know that your AFQT score determines whether you can join the military.
The good news is that, although the military wants you well grounded in math, they’re not
looking for rocket scientists. That’s NASA’s job. The two math subtests of the AFQT test your
math ability only at the high school level — there’s no advanced calculus or plotting the
orbit of subatomic particles going on here.
While I was deciding what to cover in this chapter, I quickly realized that I can’t give you an
entire high school math education in one chapter. Heck, I couldn’t do that in one whole book.
Then I realized that I don’t have to try to cram all the math you learned in 13 years of school
into one chapter. If you’re reading this book, you’re obviously interested in joining the mili-
tary. And in order to join the military, you must be either a high school graduate or a GED
holder, or you must have at least 15 college credits. That means you’ve already learned this
stuff. All I need to do is provide you a bit of a refresher — remind you of all those rules of
math you may have forgotten or put into the back of your mind. And that’s what you find
here — a refresher course, designed to draw out all the math you already know!
So look at it this way: You already know what you need to know in order to ace the AFQT —
your job is just to remind yourself of what you know. In this chapter, I help you do exactly that.
Math Terminology
Some people are intimidated by math, in part, because it has its own language. In Chapter 10,
I explain how to use keywords in math word problems to translate English into mathematical
equations. But that’s not enough. You need to know basic math terminology in order to solve
many of the problems you’ll see on the two math subtests that make up the AFQT.

For example, a question may ask you to define a prime number. If you’d read this chapter,
you’d know that a prime number is any positive number, evenly divisible by only itself and
the number one. Another question may ask, “What is the sum of 52 and 31?” Sum means
addition, so the answer would be 83.
I just looked in my handy-dandy pocket math dictionary. There are over 700 mathematical
terms listed there. Wait a minute! Sit back down. You don’t need to memorize 700 terms. You
won’t see the math term brachistochrone on any of the subtests, for example. Remember:
The military isn’t looking for physicists or mathematical theorists.
Brachistochrone is a term from Greek meaning “shortest time.” The special property of a
brachistochrone is the fact that a bead sliding down a brachistochrone-shaped frictionless
wire will take a shorter time to reach the bottom than with a wire curved into any other
shape. Just in case you were curious.
You should commit to memory a few math terms, because you’re likely to see them used, in
one way or another, on the Mathematics Knowledge subtest or the Arithmetic Reasoning
subtest. Here’s some of what you need to know:
 Average: The average usually refers to the arithmetic mean or just the mean average.
To find the mean of a set of n numbers, add the numbers in the set and divide the sum
by n. For example, the average (or arithmetic 
mean) of 3, 7, 10, and 12 is: 
.
You may have seen the term geometric mean and wondered how it differs from the
arithmetic mean. To solve for the geometric mean, you multiply the numbers and then 
take the nth root of the product. The geometric mean of 4, 6, and 8 is 
. You
won’t be asked to solve geometric mean problems on either of the math subtests con-
tained in the ASVAB, though.
 Coefficient: The number multiplied times a variable or a product of variables or
powers of variables in a term. For example, 123 is the coefficient in the term 123x3y.
 Evaluate: This means to figure out or calculate. If you’re asked to evaluate 5 + 3, that
means to simplify the term to 8.
 Pi: In mathematic equations and terms, pi is usually expressed by its Greek letter, π. Pi
represents the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, and it’s used in sev-
eral formulas, especially formulas involving geometry. Pi’s value is 3.141592653589793 . . .
(on and on forever), but it’s traditional in common math problems to use the value 3.14 
or 
.
 Prime number: A positive integer that can only be divided evenly by itself and 1. For
example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on are all primes. One afternoon, all the famous math-
ematicians got together over a beer and agreed among themselves that 1 is not a prime
number.
Positive numbers that have factors other than themselves and 1 as factors are called
composite numbers. Again, by convention, 1 is not considered a composite number.
 Product: The result of multiplication. The product of 2 and 9 is 18.
 Quotient: The result of division. 40 divided by 5 has a quotient of 8.
43 divided by 5 has a quotient of 8 and a remainder of 3.
 Reciprocal: A fraction flipped upside down. The reciprocal of x is . The reciprocal of 
is x, and x = 0.
 Sum: The result of addition. The sum of 3 and 6 is 9.

You’re not done with math vocabulary yet. There are many more math words and terms you
need to know. I explain them in the following sections.
Expressions and Equations: The Heart of Math
Math without expressions and equations is like a fire hydrant without a dog — they just go
together. So, what’s the difference between a mathematical expression and an equation?
 An expression is any mathematical calculation or formula combining numbers and/or
variables. Expressions do not include equal signs (=). For example, 3 + 2 is an expres-
sion, and so is x(x + 2) – 3.
 An equation, on the other hand, is a mathematical sentence built from expressions using
one or more equal signs (=). For example, 3 + 2 = 5 is an equation, and x(x + 2) – 3 = 30 is
also an equation.
Order of operations
In math, you must solve equations by following steps in a proper order. If you don’t, you
won’t get the right answer. Many of the most frequent errors that people make occur when
they don’t follow the order of operations when solving mathematical problems.
Keep in mind the following order of operations:
1. Start with calculations in brackets or parentheses.
When you have nested parentheses or brackets (parentheses or brackets inside other
parentheses or brackets), do the inner ones first and work your way outward.
2. Then do terms with exponents and roots.
3. Move on to multiplication and division next, in order from left to right.
4. Do the addition and subtraction, also in order from left to right.
An easy way to remember this is to think of the phrase, “Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally”
(Parentheses, Exponents, Multiply, Divide, Add, Subtract).
Take the following equation out for a ride.
Solve: 3 × (5 + 2) + 52 ÷ 2.
Do the calculations in the parentheses first:
3 × (5 + 2) + 52 ÷ 2 = 3 × 7 + 52 ÷ 2
Next, simplify the exponents:
3 × 7 + 25 ÷ 2
Do multiplication and division from left to right:
21 + 12.5
Finally, perform addition and subtraction from left to right:
33.5

Keeping equations balanced
One of the coolest things about equations is that you can do almost anything you want to
them, as long as you remember to do the exact same thing to both sides of the equation. This
is called keeping the equation balanced. For example, if you have the equation 4 + 1 = 3 + 2,
you can add 3 to both sides of the equation and it will still balance out: 4 + 1 + 3 = 3 + 2 + 3.
You can divide both sides by 3 and it will still balance: (4 + 1) ÷ 3 = (3 + 2) ÷ 3.
You’ll come to appreciate how handy equation balancing can be when you review algebra
later in this chapter (see the “Alphabet Soup: Algebra Review” section).
Mental Math: The Distributive Property
Have you ever envied those people who can perform calculations on large numbers in their
heads? What if I told you that you could be one of those people? That’s right. All you have to
do is practice the distributive property of math.
The distributive property, often referred to as the distributive law of math, makes it possible
to separate or break larger numbers into parts for simpler arithmetic. It basically says that
a(b + c) is the same as (a × b) + (a × c).
Suppose you wanted to mentally multiply 4 by 53.
4 × 53 is the same as (4 × 50) + (4 × 3). Four times 50 is easy — it’s 200. Four times 3 is also
easy. It’s 12. Two hundred plus 12 is 212.
Try another one with a bit of a twist.
Mentally perform the calculation, 12 × 19.
12 × 19 is equivalent to 12x(20 – 1) = (12 × 20) – (12 × 1).
You can quickly mentally calculate that 12 times 20 is 240, and that 12 times 1 is 12. Subtract
12 from 240, and you have 228.
Figure 8-1 illustrates how this works.

Part III: Calculating Better Math Knowledge 

If 12 × 20 is still too large for mental calculation, you can break it down to (12 × 10) + (12 × 10),
or 120 + 120.
The distributive property can be used for division, as well, although that takes a bit more
practice: 340 ÷ 4 is the same as (340 ÷ 2) ÷ 2. You can quickly calculate that 340 divided by 2
is 170, and 170 divided by 2 is 85.
And 340 ÷ 4 can also be expressed as (100 ÷ 4) + (100 ÷ 4) + (100 ÷ 4) + (40 ÷ 4).
You can mentally calculate 100 divided by 4 as 25. Forty divided by 4 is also easy — it’s 10.
So, 25 + 25 + 25 + 10 = 85. Keep practicing, and you’ll be known as the neighborhood lightning
calculator.
You’re not allowed to use calculators on the math subtests of the ASVAB, so practicing the
distributive property can be a big timesaver.
Fun with Factors
A factor is simply a number that is multiplied to get a product. Factoring a number means
taking the number apart. It’s kind of like multiplying in reverse. For example, the factors of 12
are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12, because all these numbers can be divided evenly into 12.
Here are some other factors:
 2: 1, 2
 3: 1, 3
 4: 1, 2, 4
 5: 1, 5
 6: 1, 2, 3, 6
 16: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
 20: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20
 45: 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45
Types of factors
A factor can be either a prime number or a composite number (except that 1 and 0 are
neither prime nor composite). As I mention in the “Math Terminology” section, earlier in
this chapter, prime numbers have only themselves and 1 as a factor, while composite num-
bers can be divided evenly by other numbers.
The prime numbers up to 100 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61,
67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 97.

Chapter 8: Know Your Math

Finding prime factors
Any composite number can be written as a product of prime factors. Mathematicians call
this prime factorization. To find the prime factors of a number, you divide the number by the
smallest possible prime number and work up the list of prime numbers until the result is
itself a prime number.
Say you wanted to find the prime factors of 240. Because 240 is even, start by dividing it by
the smallest prime number, which is 2 — 240 ÷ 2 = 120. The number 120 is also even, so it can
be divided by 2 — 120 ÷ 2 = 60. Then 60 ÷ 2 = 30 and 30 ÷ 2 = 15. Now, 15 is not even, so check
to see if it can be divided by 3 (the next highest prime number) — 15 ÷ 3 = 5, which itself is a
prime number, so 240 is now fully factored. Now, simply list the divisors to write the prime
factors of 240:
240 ÷ 2 = 120
120 ÷ 2 = 60
60 ÷ 2 = 30
30 ÷ 2 = 15
15 ÷ 3 = 5
The prime factors of 240 are 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 5.
Least Common Multiples
A common multiple is a number that is a multiple of two or more numbers. For example, 20,
30, and 40, are common multiples of the numbers 5 and 10.
The least common multiple (LCM) of two or more numbers is the smallest number (not zero)
that is a multiple of both or all of the numbers. The LCM is number that’s useful in solving
many math problems — especially those involving fractions (see “Conquering the Fear of
Fractions,” later in this chapter).
One way to find the LCM is to list the multiples of each number, one at a time, until you find
the smallest multiple that is common to all the numbers.
Find the LCM of 45 and 50.
 Multiples of 45: 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, 315, 360, 405, 450
 Multiples of 50: 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450
The LCM of 45 and 50 is 450.
That was rather cumbersome, wasn’t it? Wouldn’t it be great if there were an easier way?
There is, and I’m here to let you in on the secret: The easiest way to find the LCM is first to
list the prime factors of each number (see the “Finding prime factors” section, earlier in this
chapter):
 The prime factors for 45 are 3 × 3 × 5.
 The prime factors for 50 are 2 × 5 × 5.
76
Part III: Calculating Better Math Knowledge 

Then multiply each factor the greatest number of times it occurs in either number. If the same
factor occurs more than once in both numbers, you multiply the factor the greatest number of
times it occurs. For example, 5 occurs as a prime factor of both 45 (where it occurs once) and
50 (where it occurs twice); the two occurrences in factorization of 50 trump the single occur-
rence in the factorization of 45. The number 3 occurs two times, 5 occurs two times, and 2
occurs once, so you have 3 × 3 × 5 × 5 × 2 = 450
It’s always a great idea to check your answer to see if 45 and 50 both divide evenly into 450.
That was so much fun, I bet you want to try another one:
What is the least common multiple of 5, 27, and 30?
List the prime factors of each number (see the “Finding prime factors” section):
 Prime factors of 5: 5
 Prime factors of 27: 3 × 3 × 3
 Prime factors of 30: 2 × 3 × 5
The number 3 occurs a maximum of three times, 5 occurs a maximum of one time, and 2
occurs a maximum of one time: 3 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 2 = 270. Check your answer by seeing if 5, 27,
and 30 can all divide evenly into 270.
Conquering the Fear of Fractions
I don’t know why, but most people I know don’t like to do math with fractions. Maybe it’s
because, in school, teachers always used pies as an example, and that just makes you
hungry. The pies were all imaginary, too, so you didn’t even get a piece after all the figuring
was done.
I’m going to break convention and use squares of cardboard instead. Sure, they’re harder to
cut than pies, but they don’t smell as enticing.
A fraction is nothing more than part of a whole. Take a look at Figure 8-2.

Each shaded area represents part of a whole, or a fraction of the whole. It doesn’t have to
be fourths. If I had divided the cardboard into two equal pieces, each shaded area would
represent one-half. If the cardboard were cut into three equal pieces, each piece would be
one-third of the whole.
Fractions aren’t difficult to work into your mathematical skills, as long as you remember a
few rules and techniques.
Parts and types of fractions
The top number of a fraction is called the numerator. The bottom number is known as the 
denominator. For example, in the fraction 
, 7 is the numerator and 16 is the denominator.
You may also see numerators and denominators separated by a / sign instead of one on top 
of the other. 1⁄4 is the same as .
If the numerator is smaller than the denominator, that means the fraction is less than a whole 
(smaller than 1). This is called a proper fraction. The fraction 
is a proper fraction, as is .
If the numerator is larger than the denominator, the fraction is larger than a whole (larger than 
one), and the fraction is called an improper fraction. The fraction 
is an improper fraction.
It is customary in math to convert improper fractions to mixed numbers, especially after all
mathematical operations are complete. A mixed number is a whole number plus a fraction.
The easiest way to convert an improper fraction to a mixed number is to divide the numerator 
by the denominator. 
is converted to a mixed number by dividing 17 by 16 — 17 ÷ 16 = 1, 
with a remainder of 1, so the improper fraction converts to 
.
Simplifying fractions
Simplifying (or reducing) fractions means to make the fraction as simple as possible. You’re
usually required to do this on the ASVAB math subtests before you can select the correct 
answer. For example, if you worked out a problem and the answer was , the correct answer 
choice on the math subtest would probably be , which is the simplest equivalent to .
There are many methods of simplifying fractions. In this section, I give you the two that I
think are the easiest — you can decide which is best for you.
Method 1: Dividing by the lowest prime numbers
Try dividing the numerator and denominator by the lowest prime numbers (see the “Types
of factors” section), until you can’t go any further.
Simplify 
.
Both the numerator and denominator are even numbers, so they can be divided by the 
lowest prime number, which is 2. Then 24 ÷ 2 = 12, and 108 ÷ 2 = 54. The result is 
.
The numerator and denominator are both still even numbers, so divide by 2 again — 12 ÷ 2 = 6 
and 54 ÷ 2 = 27. The result is 
.
78
Part III: Calculating Better Math Knowledge 

This time the denominator is an odd number, so you know it can’t be divided by 2. Try the 
next highest prime number, which is 3 — 6 ÷ 3 = 2, and 27 ÷ 3 = 9. The result is .
Because no common prime numbers will divide evenly into both 2 and 9, the fraction is fully
simplified.
Method 2: Listing prime factors
This method of simplification is my favorite. Simply list the prime factors of both the numera-
tor and the denominator (see the “Finding prime factors” section), and then see if any cancel
out (are the same).
Try this method using the same fraction, 
.
The prime factors of 24 are 2 × 2 × 2 × 3.
The prime factors of 108 are 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3
The fraction can now be written as 
.
Two of the twos and one of the threes cancel out, and can be removed from both the 
numerator and the denominator. What’s left is 
, or .
Multiplying fractions
Multiplying fractions is very easy. All you have to do is multiply the numerators by each
other, multiply the denominators by each other, and then simplify the result.
The fraction 
can be simplified to 
(see the “Simplifying fractions” section).
Before multiplying mixed numbers, change them to improper fractions.
Dividing fractions
Dividing fractions is almost the same as multiplying, with one important difference: You have
to convert the second fraction (the divisor) to the reciprocal, and then multiply. As I explain
in the “Math Terminology” section at the beginning of this chapter, the reciprocal is simply a
fraction flipped over.
Solve: 
.
Take the reciprocal of the second fraction and multiply it with the other fraction:
The fraction 
is an improper fraction, which can be converted to 
(see the “Parts and 
types of fraction” section). Then 
can be simplified to 
(see the “Simplifying fractions” 
section).

Chapter 8: Know Your Math

Adding and subtracting fractions
Adding and subtracting fractions can be as simple as multiplying and dividing them, or it can
be more difficult. It all depends on whether or not the fractions have the same denominator.
Adding and subtracting fractions with like denominators
To add or subtract two fractions with the same denominator, add (or subtract) the numera-
tors, and place that sum (or difference) over the common denominator:
Adding and subtracting fractions with different denominators
You can’t add or subtract fractions with different denominators. So, what do you do? You
have to convert the fractions so that they all have the same denominator, and then perform
addition or subtraction as I explain in the preceding section.
Converting fractions so that they share the same denominator involves finding a common
denominator. A common denominator is nothing more than a common multiple of all the
denominators (see the “Least Common Multiples” section, earlier in this chapter).
Find a common denominator for the fractions 
and .
The multiples of 5 are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40.
The multiples of 8 are 8, 16, 24, 32, and 40.
A common denominator for the fractions 
and 
is 40.
The next step in the addition/subtraction process is to convert the fractions so they share
the common denominator. In order to do this, divide the original denominator into the new
common denominator, and then multiply the result by the original numerator.
Start with . Divide the original denominator (5) into the new common denominator (40): 
40 ÷ 5 = 8. Next multiply the result (8) by the original numerator (3): 8 × 3 = 24. The equivalent 
fraction is 
.
Perform the same operation with the second fraction, . Divide the original denominator (8)
into the new common denominator (40): 40 ÷ 8 = 5. Next multiply this (5) by the original 
numerator (1): 5 × 1 = 5. The equivalent fraction is 
.
Now that the fractions have the same denominator, you can add or subtract them as shown
in the previous section:
Performing multiple operations
By now you’re probably anxious to test your newfound ability to work with fractions. Give
this one a try:

On the surface, this looks like a complicated problem. But, if you remember the order of
operations (see the “Order of Operations” section) and take the problem one step at a time,
it’s really easy.
Under the order of operations, you do the work in the parentheses first:
and 
The problem now reads 
.
Continue by performing the next operation in the parentheses:
The problem is now much simpler:

Converting fractions to decimals
Some math problems will require you to perform operations on both decimal numbers (see
the “Dealing with Decimals” section) and fractions. To properly perform such calculations,
you must either convert the fraction to a decimal number or convert the decimal to a fraction.
Converting a fraction to a decimal number is easy. You simply divide the numerator by the
denominator:
What could be easier than that? Try the following:
Solve: 
.
Convert the fraction to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator:
Now you can easily perform the operation: 0.5 + 0.34 = 0.84.
Comparing fractions
The two math subtests of the ASVAB will often ask you to compare fractions to determine
which one is the largest or which one is the smallest. If the fractions all have the same
denominator, it’s easy. The fraction with the largest numerator is the largest, and the one
with the smallest numerator is the smallest.
81
Chapter 8: Know Your Math

But how do you compare fractions that have different denominators? There are two proven
methods. I’ll leave it up to you to determine which one you like the best.
Method 1: Finding a common denominator
The first method is to convert the fractions so that they all have a common denominator
(see the “Adding and subtracting fractions with different denominators” section). After con-
version, the fraction with the largest numerator is the largest fraction, and the one with the
smallest numerator is the smallest. This is the method you probably learned in school.
Which of the following fractions is the largest: 
, , 
, or 
?
First, find a common multiple for each denominator:
 The multiples of 12 are: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144, 156, 168, 180,
192, 204, 216, 228, 240.
 The multiples of 4 are: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76,
80, 84, 88, 92, 100, 104, 108, 112, 116, 122 . . . 240.
 The multiples of 15 are: 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150, 165, 180, 195, 210,
225, 240.
 The multiples of 16 are: 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144, 160, 176, 192, 208, 224, 240.
The lowest common denominator for all four fractions is 240.
Next, convert all the fractions so that they have a denominator of 240. Do this by dividing the
new common denominator by the original denominator of the fraction, and then multiplying
the result by the original numerator:




The largest fraction is the one with the largest numerator, or 
or 
.
Method 2: The cross-product method
You may have found Method 1 to be a bit time-consuming. If so, I think you’ll enjoy this
method. I certainly wish my teachers had heard of it when I was in high school. Maybe they
explained it and I was sleeping that day.
The second method is called the cross-product method. To use it, you compare the cross-prod-
uct of two fractions. The first cross-product is the product of the first numerator and the
second denominator. The second cross-product is the product of the second numerator and
the first denominator. If the cross-products are equal, the fractions are equivalent. If the first
cross-product is larger, the first fraction is larger. If the second cross-product is larger, the
second fraction is larger.
Compare the same fractions again:
Which of the following fractions is the largest: 
, , 
, or 
?
82
Part III: Calculating Better Math Knowledge 

Compare the first two fractions, 
and : 5 × 4 = 20 and 12 × 3 = 36. The second fraction is 
larger.
Compare the largest fraction, , with the next fraction, 
: 3 × 15 = 45 and 4 × 9 = 36, so 
is
still the largest fraction.
Take the largest fraction, , and compare it to the final fraction, 
: 3 × 16 = 48, and 4 × 13 = 52. 
The final fraction, 
, is the largest.
Getting rational about ratios
Ratios represent how one quantity is related to another quantity. A ratio may be written as 
A:B or 
or by the phrase “A to B.”
A ratio of 1:3 says that the second quantity is three times as large as the first. A ratio of 2:3
means that the second quantity is three times larger than one-half of the first quantity. A ratio
of 5:4 means the second quantity is four times larger than one-fifth of the first quantity.
A ratio is actually a fraction. For example, the fraction 
is also a ratio of 3 to 4. Solve problems 
including ratios the same way you solve problems that include fractions.
Dealing with Decimals
Decimals are a method of writing fractional numbers without writing a fraction having a 
numerator and denominator. The fraction 
could be written as the decimal 0.7. The period 
or decimal point indicates that this is a decimal. The decimal 0.7 could be pronounced as
“seven-tenths” or as “zero point seven.”
There are other decimals such as hundredths or thousandths. They’re all based on the
number ten, just like our number system:
 0.7: Seven-tenths (
)
 0.07: Seven-hundredths (
)
 0.007: Seven-thousandths (
)
 0.0007: Seven-ten-thousandths (
)
 0.00007: Seven-hundred-thousandths (
)
If a decimal is less than 1, it’s traditional in mathematics to place a zero before the decimal
point. Write “0.7” not “.7”
A decimal may be greater than one. The decimal 3.7 would be pronounced as “three and 
seven-tenths” (
).
83
Chapter 8: Know Your Math

Converting decimals to fractions
Remember, a decimal is just another way of expressing a fraction — 0.7 is actually 
, 0.07 
is 
, and so on. To convert a decimal to a fraction, write all the digits following the decimal 
point in the numerator. If there are zeros before any nonzero digits, they can be ignored. 
The denominator is always a one followed by zeros. The number of zeros in the denominator
is determined by the total number of digits to the right of the decimal point (including the
leading zeros):
 One digit: Denominator = 10. Example: 
 Two digits: Denominator = 100. Example: 
 Three digits: Denominator = 1,000. Example: 
 Four digits: Denominator = 10,000. Example: 
Of course, fractions can also be converted to decimals (see the “Converting fractions to deci-
mals” section, earlier in this chapter).
Adding and subtracting decimals
You add and subtract decimals just as you do regular numbers (integers), except that, before
you perform your operation, you arrange the numbers in a column with the decimals lined
up one over the other.
Add the numbers 3.147, 148.392, and 0.074.
Put the numbers in an addition column with the decimals lined up, and perform the addition:
Multiplying decimals
There are three steps to multiplying decimals:
1. Convert the decimals to whole numbers by moving the decimal points to the right,
remembering to count how many spaces you move each decimal point.
2. Multiply the whole numbers just as you would perform any other multiplication.
3. Place the decimal point in the sum by moving the decimal point to the left the same
number of (total) spaces you moved them to the right at the beginning.
Multiply: 3.724 × 0.0004 × 9.42.
84
Part III: Calculating Better Math Knowledge 

First convert the decimals to whole numbers by moving the decimal points to the right
(remember to count).
3.724 becomes 3,724 (decimal moved three spaces).
0.0004 becomes 4 (decimal moved four spaces).
9.42 becomes 942 (decimal moved two spaces).
Next, perform the multiplication on the whole numbers:
3,724 × 4 × 942 = 14,032,032
Finally, replace the decimal point in the correct position by moving it to the left the same
number of places you moved them to the right. You moved the decimal points a total of nine
spaces to the right at the beginning, so now place the decimal point nine spaces to the left:

Dividing decimals
Dividing decimals can be a challenge. You have to use both subtraction and multiplication.
You also need to be pretty good at rounding (see the “Rounding” section) and estimating
numbers.
You’re not allowed to use a calculator on the ASVAB math subtests.
There are two ways to divide decimals: long division and conversion.
Long division
To do long division with decimals, follow these steps:
1. If the divisor is not a whole number, move the decimal point in the divisor all the
way to the right (to make it a whole number), and move the decimal point in the
dividend the same number of places to the right.
2. Position the decimal point in the result directly above the decimal point in the
dividend.
3. Divide as usual.
If the divisor doesn’t go into the dividend evenly, add zeroes to the right of the last
digit in the dividend and keep dividing until it comes out evenly or a repeating pattern
shows up.
Try the following division problem:
7.42 ÷ 0.7.
Write the problem on your scratch paper in long-division form:
Now move the decimal point one place to the right, which makes the divisor a whole number.
Also move the decimal point in the dividend one place to the right:
85
Chapter 8: Know Your Math

Position the decimal point in the result directly above the decimal point in the dividend:
Divide as usual. 7 goes into 70, ten times:
7 goes into 42 six times:
Conversion method
Decimals are just another way to display fractions. The other way to divide decimals is to
convert the decimals to fractions (see the “Converting decimals to fractions” section), and
then divide the fractions (see “Dividing fractions”).
Try the same problem using the conversion method.
7.42 ÷ 0.7.
First, convert the decimals to fractions:
Take the reciprocal of the divisor (flip the second fraction upside down), and then multiply:
The fraction 
can be simplified (see “Simplifying fractions”) to 
. Convert 
to a 
decimal (see “Converting fractions to decimals”), and the answer is 10.6.
Rounding
Rounding a number means limiting a number to a few (or no) decimal places. For example, if
you have a $1.97 in change in your pocket, you may say, “I have about two dollars.” The
rounding process simplifies mathematical operations.
86
Part III: Calculating Better Math Knowledge 

Often, numbers are rounded to the nearest tenth. The math subtests that make up the AFQT
may ask you to do this. For any number five and over, round the digit to the left up; for any
number under five, round the digit to the left down. Thus, 1.55 can be rounded up to 1.6, and
1.34 can be rounded down to 1.3.
Other numbers, such as whole numbers, can also be rounded. For example, rounded to the
nearest 100, 1,427 can be rounded to 1,400. However, most of the rounding operations you’ll
encounter on the Mathematics Knowledge subtest will involve rounding decimals to the
nearest tenth or nearest hundredth.
Percents
Percent literally means “part of 100.” That means, for example, that 25 percent is equal to 
,
which is equal to 0.25.
If a problem asks you to find 25 percent of 250, it’s asking you to multiply 250 by 0.25.
To convert a percent to a decimal number, remove the percentage sign, and move the deci-
mal point two places to the left: 15 percent is 0.15 and 15.32 percent is 0.1532. Conversely, to
change a decimal number to percent, add the percentage sign, and move the decimal point
two places to the right: 4.321 is equal to 432.1 percent.
Playing with Positive and Negative Numbers
Numbers can be positive or negative. A positive number is any number greater than zero. So, 
4, 3.2, 793, , , and 430,932,843,784 are all positive numbers.
Numbers smaller than zero are negative numbers. For every positive number, there is a nega-
tive number equivalent. Negative numbers are expressed by putting a minus sign (–) in front 
of the number. –7, –18, 
, and –743.42 are all negative numbers.
In the math subtests of the ASVAB, you’ll often be asked to perform mathematical operations
on positive and negative numbers. Just remember the following rules:
 Adding two positive numbers always results in a positive number: 3 + 3 = 6
 Adding two negative numbers always results in a negative number: –3 + –3 = –6
 Adding a negative number is the same as subtracting a positive number: 3 + (–3) =
3 – 3 = 0
 Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding a positive number: 3 – (–3) = 
3 + 3 = 6
 Multiplying or dividing two positive numbers always results in a positive number:
3 ÷ 3 = 1
 Multiplying or dividing two negative numbers always results in a positive number:
–3 × –3 = 9
 Multiplying or dividing a negative number with a positive number always results in
a negative number: –3 × 3 = –9
87
Chapter 8: Know Your Math

When you multiply a series of positive and negative numbers, count the number of negative
numbers. If the number is even, the result will be positive. If the number is odd, the result
will be negative.
Everyone knows that 10 is larger than 5 and that 20 is larger than 15. With negative numbers,
however, it works just the opposite: –10 is smaller than –5, and –20 is smaller than –15.
As you’ll recall from your math in school, any number multiplied by zero is zero.
Teachers used to teach that numbers could not be divided by zero, but then those Einstein
think-a-likes in advanced calculus showed that was not quite true. The answer to a division-
by-zero operation is known as “indeterminate” because the answer depends on what the
situation is.
Rooting for Roots and Powers
Many of the problems you’ll see on the ASVAB math subtests require you to perform calcula-
tion involving roots, such as square roots and cube roots, and numbers raised by exponents.
If that sounds confusing, don’t worry — it’s really not. Read on.
Advice about exponents
Exponents are an easy way to show that a number is to be multiplied by itself a certain
number of times. For example, 52 is the same as 5 × 5, and 43 is the same as 4 × 4 × 4. The
number or variable that is to be multiplied by itself is called the base, and the number or
variable showing how many times it is to be multiplied by itself is called the exponent.
Here are important rules when working with exponents:
 Any base raised to the power of one equals itself. For example, 61 = 6.
 Any base raised to the zero power (except 0) equals 1. For example, 30 = 1.
In case you were wondering, according to most calculus textbooks, 00 is an “indetermi-
nate form.” What mathematicians mean by “indeterminate form” is that, in some cases,
it has one value, and in other cases it has another. This is advanced calculus, however,
and you won’t have to worry about it on the ASVAB math subtests.
 To multiply terms with the same base, you add the exponents. For example, 72 × 73 = 75.
 To divide terms with the same base, you subtract the exponents. For example, 
45 ÷ 43 = 42.
 If a base has a negative exponent, it is equal to its reciprocal with a positive 
exponent. For example, 
.
 When a product has an exponent, each factor is raised to that power. For example,
(5 × 3)3 = 53 × 33.
Regarding roots
A root is the opposite of a power or an exponent. There are infinite kinds of roots. First, there
is the square root, which means “undoing” a base to the second power; the cube root, which
88
Part III: Calculating Better Math Knowledge 

means “undoing” a base raised to the third power; a fourth root, for numbers raised to the
fourth power; and so on.
However, on the ASVAB math subtests, the only questions you’re likely to see will involve
square roots, and possibly a couple of cube roots.
Getting square with square roots
A math operation requiring you to find a square root is designated by the radical symbol
. 
The number underneath the radical line is called the radicand. For example, in the operation 
, the number 36 is the radicand.
A square root is a number that, when multiplied by itself, produces the radicand. Take the
square root of 36 — 
— for example. If you multiply 6 by itself (6 × 6), you come up with
36, so 6 is the square root of 36.
However, as I mention in the “Playing with Positive and Negative Numbers” section, when
you multiply two negative numbers together, it results in a positive number. For example,
–6 × –6 also equals 36, so –6 is also the square root of 36.
That brings me to an important rule: When you take a square root, there will be two square
roots — one positive and one negative.
It’s also possible to compute the square roots of negative numbers, such as 
, but this
involves concepts such as imaginary numbers, and that’s college-level math, or advanced
math classes in high school, so you won’t be asked to do that on the ASVAB.
Square roots come in two flavors:
 Perfect squares: Only a few numbers, called perfect squares, have exact square roots.
 Irrational numbers: All the rest of the numbers have square roots that include decimals
that go on forever and have no pattern that repeats (non-repeating, non-terminating
decimals), so they’re called irrational numbers.
Perfect squares
Finding a square root can be difficult to find without a calculator, but because you can’t use a
calculator during the test, you’re going to have to use your mind and some guessing meth-
ods. To find the square root of a number without a calculator, make an educated guess and
then verify your results.
The radical symbol indicates that you’re to find the principal square root of the number
under the radical. The principal square root is a positive number. But if you’re solving an
equation such as x2 = 36, then you give both the positive and negative roots: 6 and –6.
To use the educated-guess method, you have to know the square roots of a few perfect
squares. One good way to do this is to study the squares of the square roots 1 through 12:
 1 and –1 are both square roots of 1.
 2 and –2 are both square roots of 4.
 3 and –3 are both square roots of 9.
 4 and –4 are both square roots of 16.
 5 and –5 are both square roots of 25.
 6 and –6 are both square roots of 36.
 7 and –7 are both square roots of 49.
 8 and –8 are both square roots of 64.
89
Chapter 8: Know Your Math

 9 and –9 are both square roots of 81.
 10 and –10 are both square roots of 100.
 11 and –11 are both square roots of 121.
 12 and –12 are both square roots of 144.
Irrational numbers
When the ASVAB asks you to figure square roots of numbers that don’t have perfect squares,
the task gets a bit more difficult. If you have to find the square root of a number that isn’t a
perfect square, the ASVAB usually asks you to find the square root to the nearest tenth.
Suppose you run across this problem:
Think about what you know:
 You know from the preceding section that the square root of 49 is 7, and 54 is slightly
greater than 49.
 You also know that the square root of 64 is 8, and 54 is slightly less than 64.
 So, if the number 54 is somewhere between 49 and 64, the square root of 54 is some-
where between 7 and 8.
 Because 54 is closer to 49 than to 64, the square root will be closer to 7 than to 8, so
you can try 7.3 as the square root of 54:
1. Multiply 7.3 by itself.
7.3 × 7.3 = 53.29, which is very close to 54.
2. Try multiplying 7.4 by itself to see if it’s any closer to 54.
7.4 × 7.4 = 54.76, which isn’t as close to 54 as 53.29.
3. So 7.3 is the square root of 54 to the nearest tenth.
Cube roots
A cube root is a number that when multiplied by itself three times equals the number under
the radical line. For example, the cube root of 27 is 3 because 3 × 3 × 3 = 27. A cube root is
expressed by the radical sign with a 3 written on the left of the radical line. For example, the 
cube root of 27 would be expressed as 
.
You may see one or two cube-root problems on the math subtests of the ASVAB, but proba-
bly not more than that. Plus, the problems you’ll encounter will be perfect cubes and won’t
involve irrational numbers.
Unlike square roots, numbers only have one possible cube root. If the radicand is positive,
the cube root will be a positive number.
Also, unlike square roots, it’s possible to find the cube root of a negative number, without
involving advanced mathematics. If the radicand is negative, the cube root will also be 
negative. For example, 
.
Just like square roots, you should memorize a few common cube roots:
 1 is the cube root of 1 and –1 is the cube root of –1.
 2 is the cube root of 8 and –2 is the cube root of –8.
90
Part III: Calculating Better Math Knowledge 

 3 is the cube root of 27 and –3 is the cube root of –27.
 4 is the cube root of 64 and –4 is the cube root of –64.
 5 is the cube root of 125 and –5 is the cube root of –125.
 6 is the cube root of 216 and –6 is the cube root of –216.
 7 is the cube root of 343 and –7 is the cube root of –343.
 8 is the cube root of 512 and –8 is the cube root of –512.
 9 is the cube root of 729 and –9 is the cube root of –729.
 10 is the cube root of 1,000 and –10 is the cube root of –1,000.
Scientific notation
Scientific notation is a compact format for writing very large or very small numbers.
Although it’s most often used in scientific fields, you may find a question or two on the
Mathematics Knowledge subtest of the ASVAB asking you to covert a number to scientific
notation, or vice versa.
Scientific notation separates a number into two parts: a characteristic, always greater than or
equal to 1 and less than 10, and a power of ten. Thus 1.25 × 104 means 1.25 times 10 to the
fourth power or 12,500; 5.79 × 10–8 means 5.79 divided by 10 to the eighth power or
0.0000000579.
Alphabet Soup: Algebra Review
Algebra problems are equations, which means that the quantities on both sides of the equal
sign are equal — they’re the same: 2 = 2, 1 + 1 = 2, and 3 – 1 = 2. In all these cases, the quanti-
ties are the same on both sides of the equal sign. So, if x = 2, then x is 2 because the equal
sign says so.
Visiting variables
Most algebraic equations involve the use of one or more variables. A variable is a symbol
that represents a number. Usually, algebra problems use letters such as n, t, or x for vari-
ables. In most algebra problems, your goal is to find the value of the variable. For example, in
the equation, x + 4 = 60, you would try to find the value of x by making use of several different
useful rules of algebra.
Rules of algebra
Algebra has several rules or properties, which — when combined — allow you to simplify
equations. Some (not all) equations can be simplified to a complete solution:
 You may combine like terms. This means adding or subtracting terms with variables
of the same kind. The expression 4x + 4x simplifies to 8x. 2y + y is equal to 3y. The
expression 13 – 7 + 3 simplifies to 9.
 You may use the distributive property to remove parentheses around unlike terms
(see “Mental Math: The Distributive Property,” earlier in this chapter).
91
Chapter 8: Know Your Math

 You may add or subtract any value, as long as you do it to both sides of the equation.
 You may multiply or divide by any number (except 0), as long as you do it to both
sides of the equation.
Combining like terms
One of the most common ways to simplify an expression is to combine like terms. Numeric
terms may be combined, and any terms with the same variable part may be combined.
Take, for instance, the expression 5x + 3 + 3x – 6y + 4 + 7y.
In algebra, when two or more variables are multiplied, it’s traditional to place the variables
next to each other, and omit the multiplication sign (×): a × b = ab. The same rule applies to
variables multiplied by numbers: 4 × y = 4y.
5x and 3x are like terms. So are –6y and 7y. 3 and 4 are also like terms, because they are num-
bers without variables. So, combining the like terms, you have
5x + 3x = 8x
–6y + 7y = 1y (or just y)
3 + 4 = 7
By combining the like terms, the expression 5x + 3 + 3x – 6y + 4 + 7y simplifies to 8x + y + 7.
Using the distributive property
I know what you’re thinking: You’re thinking that combining like terms is pretty cool, but
what if you have unlike terms contained within parentheses? Doesn’t the order of operations
require you to deal with terms in parentheses first? Indeed, it does, and that’s where the dis-
tributive property comes in.
Recall from the “Mental Math: The Distributive Property” section, a(b + c) = ab + ac. For
example, 6(4 + 3) is the same, mathematically, as (6 × 4) + (6 × 3).
Applying the same principle to algebra, the distributive property can be pretty darn useful in
getting rid of those pesky parentheses:
4(x + y) = 4x + 4y
Using addition and subtraction
You can use addition and subtraction to get all the terms with variables on one side of an
equation, and all the numeric terms on the other. That’s an important step in finding the
value for the variable.
The equation 3x = 21 has only the variable on one side and only a number on the other. The
equation 3x + 4 = 25 does not.
You can add and subtract any number, as long as you do it to both sides of the equation. In
this case, you want to get rid of the number 4 on the left side of the equation. How do you
make the 4 disappear? Simply subtract 4 from it:
3x + 4 – 4 = 25 – 4
The equation simplifies to 3x = 21.
92
Part III: Calculating Better Math Knowledge 

Using multiplication and division
The rules of algebra also allow you to multiply and divide both sides of an equation by any
number except zero. From the last section, you have an equation that reads 3x = 21, or 3
times x equals 21. However, you want to find the value of x, not three times x.
What happens if you divide a number by itself? The result is 1. Therefore, to change 3x to 1x
(or x), divide both sides of the equation by 3:
3x = 21
1x = 7
x = 7
But what if the equation was 
? What would you do then?
I’ll give you a hint: If you multiply any fraction by its reciprocal, the result is 1. Remember, a
reciprocal is a fraction flipped upside-down.
Remember to multiply both sides of the equation by .
All Is Not Equal: Inequalities
Remember when I said that all equations include one or more equal signs (=)? I stand by that
statement. After all, I wouldn’t lie to you. However, some math problems look very much like
equations, but they use signs other than the equal sign.
These problems are called inequalities. An equation states that each side of the equation sep-
arated by the equal sign is equal to the other. An inequality, on the other hand, says that the
two sides, separated by an inequality sign, are not equal to each other.
Just as with equations, the solution to an inequality is all the values that make the inequality
true. For the most part, you solve inequalities the same as you would solve a normal equa-
tion. There are some facts of inequality life you need to keep in mind, however. Short and
sweet, here they are:
 Negative numbers are less than zero and less than positive numbers.
 Zero is less than positive numbers but greater than negative numbers.
 Positive numbers are greater than negative numbers and greater than zero.
93
Chapter 8: Know Your Math

Although there is only one equal sign (=), there are several signs associated with inequalities:
 ≠means does not equal in the way that 3 does not equal 4 or 3 ≠4.
 > means greater than in the way that 4 is greater than 3 or 4 > 3.
 < means less than in the way the 3 is less than 4, or 3 < 4.
 ≤means less than or equal to in the way that x may be less than or equal to 4 or x ≤4.
 ≥means greater than or equal to in the way that x may be greater than or equal to 3 or
x ≥3.
You solve inequalities using the same principles of algebra used to solve equations, with the
exception of multiplying or dividing each side by a negative number (see the “Rules of alge-
bra” section). Take the following example:
Solve: 3x + 4 < 25
You’ll note that the preceding inequality is very similar to the equation I used as an example
in the last section (3x + 4 = 25).
The equation says that 3x plus 4 is equal to 25. The inequality says that 3x plus 4 is less than
25. However, the inequality is solved in the same way as the equation:
3x + 4 < 25
3x < 21
x < 7
Although you solve inequalities the same way you solve equations, there are two important
rules you need to keep in mind when working with inequalities:
 In algebra, if a = b, then b = a. In other words, you can swap the data on each side of
the equal sign, and the equation means the same thing. So, 2x + 4 = 18 and 18 = 2x + 4
are the same thing. This doesn’t work with inequalities. In other words, 2x + 4 > 18 is
not the same as 18 > 2x + 4. When you swap the data in an inequality, you have to
change the inequality sign to balance the inequality (keep the inequity true). So, 
2x + 4 > 18 is the same as 18 < 2x + 4.
 When you multiply or divide both sides of the inequality by a negative number, the
inequality sign is reversed. So, if you multiply both sides of the inequality 3 < 4 by –4,
your answer is –12 > –16.
Solving Quadratics
Algebra questions often ask you to solve for x or solve for an unknown. These questions can
be expressed, for example, as x = 2 + 3. You simply isolate the unknown on one side of the
equation and solve the other side to learn what x equals. In this case, x equals 5. The topic of
solving for unknowns is covered in more depth in the section, “Alphabet Soup: Algebra
Review,” earlier in this chapter.
94
Part III: Calculating Better Math Knowledge 

So what’s a quadratic equation? Sounds a little scary, huh? The Mathematical Knowledge
subtest may ask you to solve one of these equations, but have no fear. You’ve come to the
right place. This section can help.
Recognizing quadratics
A quadratic equation is an algebraic equation in which the highest exponent to which the
unknown is raised is 2, as in x2. They can be very simple, or very complex (or several degrees
of difficulty in between). Here are some examples:
 x2 = 36
 x2 + 4 = 72
 x2 + 3x – 33 = 0
The exponent in quadratics is never higher than 2 (because it would then no longer be the
square of an unknown, but a cube or something else). An equation that includes the variable
x3 or x4 is not a quadratic.
Solving quadratics
There are three primary ways to solve quadratics: the square-root method, factoring, or the
quadratic formula. Which method you choose depends on the difficulty of the equation.
The square-root method
Simple quadratic equations (those that consist of just one squared term and a number) can
be solved by using the square-root rule:
If x2 = k, then 
, as long as k isn’t a negative number.
Remember to include the ± sign, which indicates that the answer is a positive or negative
number. Take the following simple quadratic equation:
Solve: 3x2 + 4 = 31
1. First, isolate the variable by subtracting 4 from each side.
The result is 3x2 = 27.
2. Next, get rid of the 3 by dividing both sides of the equation by 3.
The result is x2 = 9.
3. You can now solve by using the square root rule.
x2 = 9
x = 3 and x = –3
The factoring method
Most quadratic equations you’ll encounter on the ASVAB math subtests can be solved by
putting the equation into the quadratic form, and then factoring.
95
Chapter 8: Know Your Math

The quadratic form is ax2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are just numbers. All quadratic equa-
tions can be expressed in this form. Want to see some examples?
 2x2 – 4x = 32: This equation can be expressed in the quadratic form as 
2x2 + (–4x) + (–32) = 0. So, a = 2, b = –4, and c = –32.
 x2 = 36: You can express this as 1x2 + 0x + (–36). So, a = 1, b = 0, and c = –36.
 3x2 + 6x + 4 = –33: Expressed in quadratic form, this would read 3x + 6x + 37 = 0. So, a = 3,
b = 6, and c = 37.
Ready to factor? How about trying the following equation?
Solve: x2 + 5x + 6 = 0.
Because I like you, I’ve already expressed the equation in quadratic form, saving you a little
time.
You can use the factoring method for most quadratic equations where a = 1 and c is a posi-
tive number.
The first step in factoring a quadratic equation is to draw two sets of parentheses on your
scratch paper, and then place an x at the front of each. As with the original quadratic, the
equation should equal zero:
(x )(x ) = 0
The next step is to find two numbers that, when multiplied together, equal c, and when added
together, equal b. In our example equation, b = 5, and c = 6, so you need to hunt for two num-
bers that multiply to 6, and when added, results in 5. For example, 2 × 3 = 6 and 2 + 3 = 5. In
this case, the two numbers you’re seeking are positive 2 and positive 5.
Finally, put these two numbers into your set of parentheses:
(x +2)(x +5) = 0
This means that x + 2 = 0, and/or x + 5 = 0. The solution to this quadratic equation is x = –2
and/or x = –5.
When choosing your factors, remember that they can be either positive or negative numbers.
You can use clues from the signs of b and c to help you find the numbers (factors) you need:
 If c is positive, then the factors you’re looking for are either both positive or both
negative:
• If b is positive, then the factors are positive
• If b is negative, then the factors are negative.
• b is the sum of the two factors that give you c.
 If c is negative, then the factors you’re looking for are of alternating signs; that is, one is
negative and one is positive:
• If b is positive, then the larger factor is positive.
• If b is negative, then the larger factor is negative.
• b is the difference between the two factors that give you c.
Try another one, just for giggles:
Solve: x2 – 7x + 6 = 0
96
Part III: Calculating Better Math Knowledge 

Start by writing your parentheses:
(x )(x ) = 0
In this equation, b = –7 and c = +6. Because b is negative and c is positive, both factors will be
negative.
You’re looking for two negative numbers that multiply to 6 and add to –7. Those numbers are
–1 and –6. Plugging the numbers into your parentheses, you get (x – 1)(x – 6) = 0. So, x = 1
and/or x = 6.
The quadratic formula
The square-root method can be used for simple quadratics, and the factoring method can
easily be used for many other quadratics, as long as a = 1. But what if a doesn’t equal 1, or
you can’t easily find two numbers that multiply to c and add up to b?
You can use the quadratic formula to solve any quadratic equation. So, why not just use the
quadratic formula and forget about the square-root and factoring methods? Because the
quadratic formula is kind of complex:
The quadratic formula uses the a, b, and c from ax2 + bx + c = 0, just like the factoring method.
Armed with this knowledge, you can apply your skills to a complex quadratic equation:
Solve: 2x2 – 4x – 3 = 0
In this equation, a = 2, b = –4, and c = –3. Plug the known values into the quadratic formula:
x = 2.58 and x = –0.58

of space.” Huh? Want to try that again in English?
Geometry is simply the branch of mathematics that is concerned with shapes, lines, and
angles. From the perspective of the ASVAB math subtests, you should be able to identify
basic geometric shapes and know certain properties about them, so you can determine their
angles and measurements. You’ll see a lot of geometry-related questions on both the
Mathematics Knowledge and the Arithmetic Reasoning subtests of the ASVAB.
Knowing all the angles
Angles are formed when two lines intersect at a point. Many geometric shapes are formed by
intersecting lines, which form angles. Angles can be measured in degrees. The greater the
number of degrees, the wider the angle is:
 A straight line is 180°.
 A right angle is exactly 90°.
 An acute angle is more than 0° and less than 90°.
 An obtuse angle is more than 90° but less than 180°.
 Complementary angles are two angles that equal 90° when added together.
 Supplementary angles are two angles that equal 180° when added together.
Take a look at the different types of angles in Figure 8-3.
Common geometric shapes
I’m not going to explain all the possible geometric shapes for two reasons: (1) It would take
this entire book and (2) You don’t need to know them all to solve the math problems you’ll
find on the ASVAB. However, you should recognize the most common shapes associated with
geometry.

Getting square with quadrilaterals
A quadrilateral is a geometric shape with four sides. All quadrilaterals contain interior angles
totaling 360°. Here are the five most common types of quadrilaterals:
 Squares have four sides of equal length, and all the angles are right angles.
 Rectangles have all right angles.
 Rhombuses have four sides of equal length, but the angles don’t have to be right
angles.
 Trapezoids have at least two sides that are parallel.
 Parallelograms have opposite sides that are parallel, and their opposite sides and
angles are equal.
Figure 8-4 gives you an idea of what these five quadrilaterals look like.
Trying out triangles
A triangle consists of three straight lines whose three interior angles always add up to 180°.
The sides of a triangle are called legs. Triangles can be classified according to the relation-
ship between their angles or the relationship between their sides or some combination of
these relationships. You should know the three most common types of triangles:
 Isosceles triangle: Has two equal sides, and the angles opposite the equal sides are
also equal.
 Equilateral triangle: Has three equal sides, and all the angles measure 60°.
 Right triangle: Has one right angle (90°; therefore, the remaining two angles are
complementary (add up to 90°).
The side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse, which is the longest side of a
right triangle.
Check out Figure 8-5 to see what these triangles look like.

Settling on circles
A circle is formed when the points of a closed line are all located equal distances from a point
called the center of the circle. A circle always has 360°. The closed line of a circle is called its
perimeter or circumference. The radius of a circle is the measurement from the center of the
circle to any point on the circumference of the circle. The diameter of the circle is measured
as a line passing through the center of the circle, from a point on one side of the circle all the
way to a point on the other side of the circle. The diameter of a circle is always twice as long
as the radius. Figure 8-6 shows these relationships.
Famous geometry formulas
The math subtests of the ASVAB will often ask you to use basic geometry formulas to calcu-
late geometric measurements. You should commit these simple formulas to memory.
Quadrilateral formulas you should know
You may be asked to calculate the length of the perimeter, the area, or the diagonal of a
square or rectangle. Use the following formulas:
 Perimeter of a square: p = 4s, where s = one side of the square
 Area of a square: a = s2
 Diagonal of a square:
 Perimeter of a rectangle: p = 2l + 2w, where l = the length and w = the width of the
rectangle
 Area of a rectangle: a = lw
 Diagonal of a rectangle:
Good-to-know triangle formulas
Some math problems on the ASVAB may ask you to calculate the perimeter or area of a trian-
gle. The following formulas are used for these two purposes:
 Perimeter of a triangle: p = s1 + s2 + s3, where s = the length of each leg of the triangle
 Area of a triangle:
, where b = the length of the triangle’s base (bottom) and 
h = the height of the triangle

Part III: Calculating Better Math Knowledge 

There is a special formula, called the Pythagorean theorem, that says if you know the length
of any two sides of a triangle, you can find the length of the third side. This only works, how-
ever, on right triangles (see the “Trying out triangles” section). The formula is a2 + b2 = c2,
where c equals the length of the triangle’s hypotenuse, and a and b equal the lengths of the
remaining two sides, called legs.
Seizing circle formulas
Circles are a bit more complex than squares, rectangles, and triangles, and often involve
invoking the value of π. In the “Math Terminology” section, earlier in this chapter, I tell you
that π is approximately equal to 3.14.
 Radius of a circle:
, where d = the diameter of the circle
 Diameter of a circle: d = 2r
 Circumference of a circle: c = 2πr
 Area of a circle: a = πr2
Handy formulas for three-dimensional shapes
Sometimes the math subtests will require you to calculate measurements for solid (three-
dimensional) shapes. These types of questions generally come in two flavors: calculating
volume or calculating surface area.
Volume is the space a shape takes up. You can think of volume as how much a shape would
hold if you poured water into it. Surface area is the area of the outside of the shape — for
example, the amount of area you would have to cover if you were to paint the outside of the
solid shape.
 Volume of a cube: v = s3, where s = the length of one side of the cube
 Volume of a rectangular box: v = lwh, where l = the length, w = the width, and h = the
height of the box
 Volume of a cylinder: v = πr2h, where r = the radius of the cylinder and h = the height of
the cylinder
 Surface area of a cube: SA = 6s2
 Surface area of a rectangular box: SA =2lw + 2wh + 2lh

 Categorizing questions

 Practicing your technique
T
wo math subtests help determine your AFQT score. I talk about the Arithmetic
Reasoning subtest, which is all about math word problems, in Chapters 10 and 11. This
chapter and Chapter 8 are designed to help you get ready for the other math subtest: the
Mathematics Knowledge subtest.
Most of the time, the Mathematics Knowledge subtest only contains one or two questions
testing each specific mathematical concept. For example, one question may ask you to multi-
ply fractions, the next question may ask you to solve a mathematical inequality, and the
question after that may ask you to find the value of an exponent. (If I’ve freaked you out with
the last sentence, calm down. I cover all this stuff in Chapter 8.)
All this variety forces you to constantly shift your mental gears to quickly deal with different
concepts. You can look at this situation from two perspectives: These mental gymnastics can
be difficult and frustrating, especially if you know everything about solving for x but nothing
about deriving a square root. But variety can also be the spice of life, as your grandma may
have said. If you don’t know how to solve a specific type of problem, this oversight may only
cause you to get one question wrong (or maybe two — but think positive).
Taking Stock of the Test Structure
The Mathematics Knowledge subtest consists of 25 questions covering the entire array of
high school math. You have 24 minutes to complete the subtest. You don’t necessarily have
to rush through each calculation, but the pace you need to set (a little less than a minute per
question) doesn’t exactly give you time to daydream about what you’re having for dinner.
You have to focus and concentrate to solve each problem quickly and accurately.
Like all math subtests on the ASVAB, the narrow-minded people who make up the rules have
dictated you can’t use a calculator. When you enter the testing room, you’ll be given a pencil
and a sheet of scratch paper. (I guess their thinking is that if you’re in the middle of a combat
zone and find a sudden need to solve for x, you may find your calculator full of sand and
worthless.) The good news is, all the questions on the math subtests of the ASVAB are
designed so that they can be solved without electronic calculation.

There are three types of questions on the Mathematics Knowledge subtest:
 Direct math: This type of question presents you with a mathematical equation and
asks you to solve it.
 Math law: This type of question asks you a about a mathematical law, rule, term, or
concept.
 Combined: This type of question asks you to use a mathematical law, rule, term, or
concept to solve a problem.
Direct math questions
The direct math question is the most common type of question on the Mathematics
Knowledge subtest. In a direct math question, you’re presented with an equation and asked
to solve it. You’ll see a lot of these.
Solve for x: 2x + 4(2x + 7) = 3(2x + 4)
(A) 0.75
(B) –4
(C) 1.25
(D) –1.25
This is an algebraic equation that you can solve using the rules of algebra (see Chapter 8):
2x + 4(2x + 7) = 3(2x + 4)
2x + 8x + 28 = 6x + 12
10x + 28 = 6x + 12
4x + 28 =12
4x = –16
x = –4
Math law questions
Sometimes the Mathematics Knowledge subtest asks you a question that doesn’t involve
solving a mathematical problem. Instead, you’re expected to answer a question concerning
a mathematical concept, math term, rule, or law. You’re not likely to see more than two or
three of these kinds of questions on the test, however.
In the expression “432xy + 124xy,” the “432” is called the:
(A) multiplier
(B) coefficient
(C) matrix
(D) prime
104
Part III: Calculating Better Math Knowledge 

The answer is B, coefficient. A coefficient is the number multiplied times a variable or a 
product of variables or powers of variables in a term. (You’ll find more useful math terms in
Chapter 8.)
Combined questions
You may see eight or nine combined questions on the Mathematics Knowledge subtest.
These questions require you to use a particular math term, rule, or concept to solve a mathe-
matical problem.
What is the quotient of 4 and 4.
(A) 8
(B) 16
(C) 0
(D) 1
To solve this problem, you need to know that a quotient is the result of a division operation.
When you’ve figured that out, you have to perform the operation:
4 ÷ 4 = 1
Planning Your Test Attack
For most people, scoring well on the Mathematics Knowledge subtest requires more than
just showing up on time and borrowing a No. 2 pencil and piece of scratch paper. Maybe
everything on the test will go perfectly, and you’ll breeze through without a problem. On the
other hand, maybe you’ll get stuck on a question or run into other roadblocks. When this
happens, having a plan of attack is helpful.
Keeping an eye on the all-important clock
Like all subtests of the ASVAB, the Mathematics Knowledge subtest is timed. You have just
24 minutes to try to correctly answer 25 questions. That’s 57.6 seconds per question. (Do you
like the way I used math to figure that out?)
If you’re taking the computerized version of the ASVAB, your remaining time will be in the
upper corner of your computer screen. If you’re taking the paper version, the room will have
a clock in it, and the start time and stop time will be posted somewhere in the room, easily
visible to you and the other test takers.
Keep an eye on the clock. You want to try to finish the test before time runs out. Try to aver-
age about 45 or 50 seconds per question. If you get stuck on a question, try the “Playing the
guessing game” techniques, later in this chapter.
105
Chapter 9: The Mathematics Knowledge Subtest

Doubling your chances by double-checking
If you have time, double-check your answers. Those crafty test makers often provide wrong
answer choices that work if you made a common error, so don’t assume that just because
your answer matches one of the possible answer choices that it’s the right one. Look at the
following example:
Solve: 
(A)
(B) 2
(C) 17
(D)
To correctly solve this problem, you multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal (flipped
over) value of the second fraction:
If you multiplied the fractions instead of dividing, you would’ve gotten A. If you took the
reciprocal of the first fraction instead of the second, you would’ve gotten B. If you took a wild
guess, you might’ve gotten C.
Although double-checking your answers is always a good idea, remember to keep an eye on
the clock. You don’t want to run out of time with only half the questions answered, because
you’ve spent too much time double-checking all your answers.
Using the answer choices to your advantage
If you’re stuck on a particular problem, sometimes plugging the possible answer choices into
the equation can help you find the right answer.
Solve: 
(A) 25
(B) 50
(C) 100
(D) 75
Suppose you experience a complete brain-freeze and can’t remember how to handle a vari-
able multiplied by a fraction. You don’t have to jump straight to random guessing at this
point. You can replace x in the equation with the known possible answer choices and see if
any of them work.
106
Part III: Calculating Better Math Knowledge 

The equation can be simplified to 
.
 x = 25:
. That doesn’t work.
 x = 50:
. That certainly doesn’t work.
 x = 100:
. You can stop here because C is the correct answer.
Don’t forget that plugging in all the answers is time-consuming, so save this procedure until
you’ve answered all the problems you can answer. If you’re taking the computer version, you
can’t skip a question, so remember to budget your time wisely — if you don’t have much
time, just make a guess and move on. You may be able to solve the next question easily.
Playing the guessing game
Guessing wrong on any of the ASVAB subtests doesn’t count against you. So scribble an
answer — any answer — on your answer sheet because, if you don’t, your chances of getting
that answer right are zero. But, if you take a shot at it, your chances increase to 25 percent,
or one in four.
If you’re taking the paper version of the ASVAB, you can always skip the tough questions and
come back to them after you’ve finished the easier ones. If you’re taking the computerized
version of the ASVAB, the software won’t let you skip questions.
If you’re taking the paper version of the test and elect to skip questions until later, make sure
you mark the next answer in the correct space on the answer sheet. Otherwise you may wind
up wearing out the eraser on your pencil when you discover your error at the end of the test.
Or, even worse, you may not notice the error, and you may wind up getting several answers
wrong because you mismarked your answer sheet.
The process of elimination
Guessing doesn’t always mean “pick an answer, any answer.” You can increase you chances
of picking the right answer by eliminating answers that can’t be right.
Solve: 
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
Any fraction that is less than one, multiplied by another fraction that is less than one is going
to result in an answer that is less than one. That means that A and B can’t be correct. Your
odds of guessing the right answer have just improved from one in four to one in two, or a
50/50 chance. (By the way, the correct answer is C.)
107
Chapter 9: The Mathematics Knowledge Subtest

Solving what you can and guessing the rest
Sometimes you may know how to solve part of a problem, but not all of it. If you don’t know
how to do all the operations, don’t give up. You can still narrow your choices by doing what
you can. Suppose this question confronts you:
What is the value of (–0.4)3?
(A) –0.0027
(B) –0.000064
(C) 0.000064
(D) 0.0009
What if you don’t remember how to multiply decimals? All is not lost! If you remember how
to use exponents, you’ll remember that you have to multiply –0.04 × –0.04 × –0.04. So, if you
simplify the problem and just multiply –4 × –4 × –4, without worrying about those pesky
zeroes, you know that your answer will be negative and will end in the digits 64. With this
pearl of wisdom in mind, you can see that A, C, and D are all wrong. You logically guessed
your way to the correct answer!
Practice Makes Perfect
How about putting all the knowledge you’ve gained about the Mathematics Knowledge sub-
test to the test? Here are ten questions that are very similar to those you’ll likely see when
you take the actual test.
1. Which of the following fractions is the smallest?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
The correct answer is C. One method of comparing fractions is called the cross-product
method (see Chapter 8).
The cross-products of the first fraction and the second fraction are 3 × 17 = 51 and 14 × 4 = 56.
The first fraction is the smallest.
The cross-products of the first fraction and the third fraction are 3 × 7 = 21 and 4 × 4 = 16. The
third fraction is the smallest.
The cross-products of the third fraction and the fourth fraction are 4 × 8 = 32 and 5 × 7 = 35.
The third fraction, Choice C, is still the smallest.
108
Part III: Calculating Better Math Knowledge 

2. What is the product of 
and 
?
(A) 1,764
(B) 42
(C) 13
(D) 6
The correct answer is B. The square root of 36 is 6 and the square root of 49 is 7. The product
of those two numbers is 6 × 7 = 42.
3. Solve: 2x – 3 = x + 7
(A) 10
(B) 6
(C) 21
(D) –10
The correct answer is A:
2x – 3 = x + 7
2x – x = 7 + 3
x = 10
4. A circle has a radius of 15 feet. What is most nearly its circumference?
(A) 30 feet
(B) 225 feet
(C) 94 feet
(D) 150 feet
The correct answer is C. The circumference of a circle is π × diameter; the diameter equals
two times the radius; and π is approximately 3.14. Therefore, 30 × 3.14 ≈94.
The ≈sign means approximately equals. It’s used here because the answer, 94, is a rounded
number.
5. At 3 p.m., the angle between the hands of the clock is
(A) 90 degrees
(B) 180 degrees
(C) 120 degrees
(D) 360 degrees
The correct answer is A. At 3 p.m., one hand is on the 12, and the other is on the 3. This
creates a right angle — a 90-degree angle.
6. If 3 + y ≥13, what is the value of y?
(A) Greater than or equal to 10
(B) Less than or equal to 10
(C) 10
(D) 6
109
Chapter 9: The Mathematics Knowledge Subtest

The correct answer is A. Solve the inequality the same way you would solve an algebraic
equation:
3 + y ≥13
y ≥13 – 3
y ≥10
7. y3 × y2 × y–3 =
(A) y2
(B) y–18
(C) y8
(D) x23
The correct answer is A. When you multiply powers with the same base, add the exponents:
y3 – y2 – y–3 = y3 + 2 + (–3) = y2.
8. 14 yards + 14 feet =
(A) 16 yards
(B) 15 yards
(C) 28 feet
(D) 56 feet
The correct answer is D. Convert the yards to feet by multiplying by 3: 14 × 3 = 42 feet.
Add this to 14 feet: 42 + 14 = 56 feet.
9. What is 35 percent of 85?
(A) 33.2
(B) 65.32
(C) 21.3
(D) 29.75
The correct answer is D. Multiply 85 with the decimal equivalent of 35 percent, or 0.35: 
0.35 × 85 = 29.75.
10. What is most nearly the average of 37, 22, 72, and 44?
(A) 43.8
(B) 55.2
(C) 175
(D) 77.1
The correct answer is A. Add the numbers, and then divide by the number of terms: 
37 + 22 + 72 + 44 = 175, and 175 ÷ 4 = 43.75. Round this number up to 43.8.

T
wo types of mathematics tests are part of the AFQT. The first type is the Mathematics
Knowledge subtest that I discussed in the last two chapters. The second type is the
Arithmetic Reasoning subtest which is the topic of this chapter and Chapter 11.
In the Mathematics Knowledge subtest, you have it pretty easy. You see a mathematical
equation, and you do your best to solve it. The Arithmetic Reasoning subtest is more
involved. You have to set up your own equations to solve the problem. Ouch! How unfair!
Those test makers are asking you not only to solve the problem, but also to write the equa-
tion in the first place!
Lots of people have difficulty with translating a math word problem into a mathematical
equation that can be solved. If you feel yourself starting to sweat at the mere thought of math
word problems, you’re not alone. Just take a deep breath, relax, and don’t worry. I’m here to
guide you through the process.
Making Sense of Word Problems
The purpose of math word problems is to test your ability to use general mathematics to
solve everyday, real-world problems. That’s what all the textbooks say. However, in my “real
world,” I’ve never once wondered how old Anna is if she’s three years older than Chuck, and
in five years, her age and Chuck’s age would equal 54. I’d just ask Anna how old she is. If she
didn’t answer, I wouldn’t buy her a birthday present.
When you realize that math word problems are designed to measure your ability to use basic
math to solve fictional problems, they can be kind of fun — sort of like solving a puzzle.

Setting Up the Problem
Word problems are nothing more than a series of expressions that fit into an equation. An
equation is a combination of math expressions. (If that sounds like Greek to you, check out
Chapter 8.) The expressions in math word problems are generally stated in English. Your job
is to dig out the relevant facts and state them in mathematical terms. You do this by:
 Getting organized
 Understanding the problem
 Identifying the information you need
 Translating the problem into one or more solvable mathematic equations
I cover all of these tasks in greater detail in the following sections.
Getting organized
Getting organized isn’t really a step as much as it is a method. You need to be organized
throughout the problem-solving process. Working clearly will help you think clearly, and it’ll
ensure you don’t get lost, while trying to define and solve the problem.
When using your scratch paper, draw and label your pictures and graphs clearly. If you go
back to your notes and can’t remember what you were thinking about when you drew that
picture, not only will you be frustrated, but you’ll have wasted valuable time — and you
don’t have any time to waste on the Arithmetic Reasoning subtest. (For more on pictures,
see the sidebar “A picture can be worth a thousand equations.”)
112
Part III: Calculating Better Math Knowledge 
A picture can be worth a thousand equations
When you walk in to take the ASVAB, the kindly test
proctors are going to give you a piece of blank scratch
paper. If you want more, they’ll gladly give you more —
they’ll even give you more you if you run out during the
exam.
Sure, the scratch sheet is handy for figuring out equa-
tions — and writing love notes to that cute guy or gal sit-
ting next to you — but it’s also useful for drawing
diagrams and pictures to help you clarify the problem in
your mind.
Sometimes, drawing a simple diagram can save you
loads of time when trying to get a quick grasp on how to
solve a math word problem. Here’s one of my favorite
examples:
A ladybug walks 5 inches directly south. She then
turns and walks 10 inches directly east. If she then
sprouts her wings and flies directly back to her start-
ing point, how far will she have to fly?
This problem becomes instantly clear with a quick dia-
gram on your scratch paper, like the sketch shown here.
The crudely drawn diagram on your scratch paper makes
it instantly clear that you need to find the length of the
hypotenuse of a right triangle. If you read Chapter 8,
you know that you can use the Pythagorean theorem 
(a2 + b2 = c2) to quickly figure this out. Without that sketch,
you might not realize how simple this problem really is.

Understanding the problem
Make sure you read the entire problem, but be careful: Don’t try too hard to understand
the problem on the first read-through. I know that doesn’t seem to make any sense, but bear
with me.
Math word problems can be broken down into two parts:
 The problem statement: The problem statement is not really an object to be under-
stood. It’s simply a source of information, much like a dictionary or telephone book
that has information you can look up, as needed, to solve the equation.
The information included in the problem statement is often confusing or disorganized.
Sometimes distracters (information that has nothing to do with solving the problem)
are mixed in, leading to confusion and making the problem difficult to solve. (See the
“Dealing with distracters” sidebar for more information.) A famous mathematician
once said, “A problem is understood by solving it, not pondering it.” Actually, he wasn’t
that famous. It was my Uncle Ed, who lives just down the street.
 The problem question: The problem question is the meat of the matter. Exactly what is
the questioner asking you to find? This is the part of the problem you really need to
understand.
Identifying the information you need
After you’ve separated the question from the statement (see the preceding section), list the
facts in a clear, concise list. Figure out what you need but don’t have, and name things. Pick
variables to stand for the unknowns, clearly labeling these variables with what they stand for.
Be as clear as possible when you identify the information you need. You don’t want to spend
five minutes on a word problem solving for x, only to reach the end and forget what x is sup-
posed to stand for. How frustrating!
Pay particular attention to include units of measure, such as feet, miles, inches, pounds, dol-
lars, and so on. One of the fastest ways to mess up on a math word problem is by forgetting
the apples-and-oranges rule. You can’t perform mathematical operations on different units of
measurement. Ten apples plus ten oranges equals 20 pieces of fruit; it does not equal 20 apples,
nor does it equal 20 oranges. Look at the following example:
A carpenter buys 44 feet of wood. If she adds the wood to the 720 inches of wood she
already owns, how many feet of wood will she have?
If you add 44 to 720, you’re going to get the wrong answer. Before you can add the numbers,
you have to either convert 44 feet of wood to inches (44 × 12 = 528 inches) or convert
720 inches to feet (720 ÷ 12 = 60 feet).
Translating the problem
Now you’re at the tough part. The hardest thing about doing word problems is taking the
English words and translating them into mathematics. Luckily, math word problems often

Addition keywords
Several words and phrases used in math word problems indicate an addition operation:
 Increased by
 More than
 Combined
 Together
 Total of
 Sum
 Added to
“The drill sergeant can do 100 pushups more than Private Jones” is equivalent to Private
Jones + 100 = drill sergeant. “Together, they can do 300 pushups” can be mathematically
stated as drill sergeant + Private Jones = 300.
Try the following example, just to see if you’re getting the hang of things:
The drill sergeant can do 100 pushups more than Private Jones. Together, they can do 300
pushups. How many pushups can Private Jones do?
The question is asking you how many pushups Private Jones can do. You’re not really inter-
ested in how many the drill sergeant can do, and the problem statement tells you that they
can do 300 total pushups together. You also know that the drill sergeant can do 100 more
than Private Jones.
List the important information:
 Let j = the number of pushups that Private Jones can do. This is what you really want
to find out, so it’s important that you define it first.
 Let d = the number of pushups that the drill sergeant can do. You don’t really want to
know this, but it’s a necessary fact in order to solve the problem.

Part III: Calculating Better Math Knowledge 
Dealing with distracters
If math word problems were all straightforward ques-
tions, such as “What is 10 multiplied by 10?”, you could
skip this chapter. However, those wascally wabbits who
write the questions stay awake at night to think up ways
to complicate things. The use of distracters is one
such way.
A distracter is any piece of information included in the
problem statement that has absolutely nothing to do with
solving the problem. Consider the following example:
In November, the National Weather Service recorded
1 inch of snow and 3 inches of rain in Grand Forks,
North Dakota. In December, these numbers were
reversed, with 3 inches of snow, and only 1 inch of
rain. How much snow did Grand Forks Receive in
total?
You don’t need to know how much rain fell in Grand Forks
in order to solve this problem. The amount of rain has
absolutely nothing to do with the problem question. It’s a
distracter — its purpose is to distract you from focusing
on the real question. The problem mentions rain, so it has
to figure into the problem in some way, doesn’t it? Wrong!
Be sure to read the question carefully and cross out any
information that’s just there to trip you up.

 You know another definition of d. The problem statement tells you that the drill ser-
geant can do 100 more pushups than Private Jones, which means that d = j + 100, which
is the same (mathematically) as saying j = d – 100.
 You know that together they can do 300 pushups, which tells you that d + j = 300.
All you need to do now is to solve that final equation in terms of j. First, use the distributive
property of math to express the equation in terms of j: d + j = 300 is the same as j = 300 – d.
You already have a definition for d from above (d = j + 100). Substitute this value for d in the
equation you’re now working to solve:
j = 300 – d
j = 300 – (j + 100)
j = 300 – j – 100
2j = 200
j = 100
Private Jones can do 100 pushups.
As an alternative, you could also substitute “j + 100” for d in the equation d + j = 100. The
answer will be the same.
Because math can be a tricky thing (I’ve been known to believe 2 + 2 = 3, before my morning
coffee), it’s always a good idea to check your answer to make sure it makes sense. Plug your
answer into the original problem and see if it works out: The drill sergeant can do 100
pushups more than Private Jones: 100 + 100 = 200. The drill sergeant can do 200 pushups.
Together, they can do 300 pushups: 100 + 200 = 300. Makes sense.
Subtraction keywords
If you see any of the following words and phrases in a math word problem, it generally indi-
cates a subtraction operation:
 Decreased by
 Minus
 Less
 Difference between/of
 Less than
 Fewer than
“Becky’s pay decreased by $10” can be stated mathematically as Becky – 10. This is also the
same as “Becky’s pay minus $10,” or “Becky’s pay less $10.”
“The difference between Bob’s pay and Becky’s pay” can be expressed as Bob – Becky.
The less than and fewer than terms work backwards in English from what they are in the
math. Although “Becky’s pay minus $10” is Becky – 10, “Becky’s pay less than x” is not
Becky – x; It’s x – Becky.
115
Chapter 10: Working with Word Problems

Multiplication keywords
The following words and phrases usually mean a mathematical multiplication operation
when included in a math word problem:
 Of
 Times
 Multiplied by
 Product of
 Increased/decreased by a factor of
“15 percent of x” is mathematically expressed as x × 0.15. “x times y” and “x multiplied by y”
mean x × y. The product of x and y is the same as x × y.
Increased by a factor of and decreased by a factor of can involve addition and subtraction
in combination with multiplication. “x increased by a factor of 10 percent” is expressed as 
x + (x × 0.10).
Division keywords
If you see the following words/phrases in a math word problem, “division operation” should
pop into your mind.
 A
 Per
 Average
 Ratio of
 Quotient of
Per and a means “divided by” — for example, “I bought 2 gallons of milk at the grocery store
and paid $3, so milk was $1.50 a gallon,” or “Milk was $1.50 per gallon.”
To find the average of a group of numbers, you add the numbers, and then divide by the
number of terms. “The average of a, b, and c” is (a + b + c) ÷ 3.
Mathematically, ratios are expressed as fractions. A ratio of five to three is written as , 
which is the same as saying 5 ÷ 3. Chapter 8 has more detail about how to work with ratios.
The “quotient of x and y” is the same as x ÷ y.
Although the preceding keywords often indicate a mathematical operation in a word problem,
that’s not always the case. You have to use a little common sense. “A man was walking down
the street,” does not mean a division operation. “Matt and Paul were working together” does not
necessarily mean you’re going to perform a math addition problem regarding Matt and Paul.
Practicing keywords
Learning how to recognize keywords is essential in translating English into mathematical
expressions. Try a few examples, just to see if you’re getting the hang of it:
 Translate “the sum of 13 and y” into an equation. This translates to 13 + y. The key-
word sum indicates an addition operation.
 How would you write “the quotient of a and 6” as an equation? The keyword
quotient means division. This translates to a ÷ 6.
116
Part III: Calculating Better Math Knowledge 

 How would “7 less than y” be written as a mathematical equation? It would be y – 7.
If you answered 7 – y, you forgot that “less than” is backwards in math from how it’s
used in English.
 Translate “the ratio of x plus 6 to 8” into an equation. “x plus 6” is an addition 
operation, while the keyword ratio indicates division. This translates to 
.
Are you ready to try a couple of longer ones? I knew you were!
 The length of a rectangle is 45 inches more than its width. Let the width = w, and
express the length in mathematical terms. More than is a keyword that means addi-
tion. Because the width = w, the length is mathematically written as w + 45.
 Paul is three years older than Marsha, who is four times the age of Brian. Express
Marsha’s age as an algebraic expression. You can express Paul’s age, Marsha’s age,
and Brian’s age using any variables you choose, but it just makes sense to use the first
letters of their name. That way, there’s less chance of forgetting what variable stands
for what factor. “Four times” indicates multiplication. Marsha’s age can be written as
4 × b, or 4b. Paul’s age can be expressed as m + 3, so Marsha’s age can also be written
as p – 3.
Confused? Check out Chapter 8 for the distributive properties of algebraic equations.
Trying Out Typical Word Problems
Now that you can recognize common keywords and translate them into mathematical
expressions, you’re ready to take on a few math word problems.
Because math word problems represent fictional real-life situations, there is an infinite
number of possible problems that test writers could come up with. However, math word
problem test writers must have limited imaginations, because certain types of questions
seem to pop up more often than others. This is true whether you’re taking the SAT or the
Arithmetic Reasoning subtest of the ASVAB.
Age problems
Age problems involve figuring out how old someone is, was, or will be at some time in the
future. You generally do this by comparing their ages to the ages of other people.
Sid is twice as old as Mary. In three years, the sum of their ages will be 66. How old are
they now?
Sometimes an age problem can be solved by using a one-variable solution, and sometimes it
takes several variables. This particular problem can be solved by using either a one-variable
solution or a two-variable solution.
One-variable solution
Let Mary’s age = x. Because Sid is twice as old as Mary, his age can be represented as 2x.
In three years, Mary’s age will be x + 3, and Sid’s age will be 2x + 3. The sum of their ages
together will be 66.
117
Chapter 10: Working with Word Problems

You now have an equation you can work with:
(x + 3) + (2x + 3) = 66
3x + 6 = 66
3x = 60
x = 20
What did x stand for again? Was it Mary’s age, or Sid’s age? Be sure to clearly label variables
on your scratch paper, so you don’t get frustrated and tear your hair out in front of everyone
else. That causes talk.
x represents Mary’s age, so Mary is 20 years old. Because Sid is twice Mary’s age, Sid is 
40 (2 × 20 = 40).
If you have time, check your answer to see that it makes sense: Sid (age 40) is twice as old as
Mary (age 20). In three years, the sum of their ages will be (40 + 3) + (20 + 3) = 43 + 23 = 66. It
fits! Isn’t math fun?
Two-variable solution
Let m = Mary’s age and s = Sid’s age. You know that Sid is twice as old as Mary, so s = 2m.
That gives you your first equation.
You also know that in three years, the sum of their ages will be 66. Stated mathematically:
(m + 3) + (s + 3) = 66
This equation can be simplified:
m + s + 6 = 66
m + s = 60
You now have two equations, with two variables that you can use to solve the problem:
s = 2m
m + s = 60
Replace s in the second equation with the definition of s in the first equation:
m + 2m = 60
3m = 60
m = 20
Mary is 20 years old. That’s the same answer you got when using the one-variable solution.
Geometric problems
These problems require you to compute the volume, perimeter, area, circumference, diame-
ter, and so on of various geometric shapes.
118
Part III: Calculating Better Math Knowledge 

You’re painting a fence that is 20 feet long and 6 feet high. How much square footage of fence
will you be covering with paint?
The area formula for a rectangle is a = lw, so the answer to this simple problem is A = 6 × 20 =
120 square feet.
Generally, the Arithmetic Reasoning test makers won’t let you off so easy, though. The prob-
lem is more likely to be written something like the following.
You’re painting a fence that is 20 feet long and 6 feet high. Paint cost $7.23 per gallon, and
1 gallon of paint will cover 60 square feet of fence. How much will you need to spend on paint
to complete the project?
The problem now requires a couple more steps to answer. First, you have to compute the
area of the fence. You already did that: 120 square feet.
Now you have to determine how many gallons of paint you need to buy to cover 120 square
feet. Because 1 gallon of paint will cover 60 square feet, you’ll need 120 ÷ 60 = 2 gallons of
paint.
Finally, you need to figure how much 2 gallons of paint will cost. Paint is $7.23 per gallon, and
you need 2 gallons, so $7.23 × 2 = $14.46.
You’ll see quite a few geometric problems on the Arithmetic Reasoning subtest. To make sure
you’re ready for them, memorize the basic geometric formulas in Table 10-1. You can find
more information about using these formulas in Chapter 8.

Coin problems
I think mathematicians must have big piggy banks. Many math word problems ask you to
figure out how many coins of various types a person has.
Jeremy has 12 more nickels than quarters. How many coins does he have if the total value of
his coins is $2.70?
Let q = quarters. Because Jeremy has 12 more nickels than quarters, this could be repre-
sented as q + 12. Jeremy has $2.70 worth of coins, which is equal to 270¢. A quarter is 25¢,
and a nickel is 5¢. Jeremy’s total coins together must equal 270¢. Therefore:
(25¢ × number of quarters) + (5¢ × number of nickels) = 270¢
Or, writing it another way:
25q + 5(q + 12) = 270
25q + 5q + 60 = 270
30q = 210
q = 7
Jeremy has 7 quarters. Because he has 12 more nickels than quarters, he has 7 + 12 = 19 nick-
els, for a total of 19 + 7 = 26 coins.
Does this answer make sense? Jeremy has 12 more nickels (19 nickels) than quarters (7 quar-
ters). How many coins does he have if the total value of his coins is $2.70? So, 19 nickels = 95¢
and 7 quarters = 175¢, so 95¢ + 175¢ = 270¢ = $2.70. It looks good to me.
Travel problems
I wish I could travel as much as word problem test writers seem to. They come up with a lot
of travel problems. They especially seem to like trains and planes. Sometimes they like cars,
but not as often.
Travel problems involve using the distance formula d = rt, where d is the distance, r is the
rate, and t is the time. Generally, the problems come in three basic flavors: traveling away
from each other, traveling in the same direction, and traveling at 90-degree angles.
120
Part III: Calculating Better Math Knowledge 

Traveling away from each other
When two planes (or trains or cars or people or even bugs) travel in opposite directions,
they increase the distance between them in direct proportion. To solve these types of prob-
lems, you compute the distance traveled from the starting point for each plane (or train or
car or person or bug).
Train A travels north at 60 mph. Train B travels south at 70 mph. If both trains leave the sta-
tion at the same time, how far apart will they be at the end of two hours?
To solve this problem, you compute the distance traveled by train A, and then the distance
traveled by train B, and add the results together.
The distance formula is d = rt. The rate of travel for train A is 60 mph, and it travels for two
hours:
d = 60 × 2
d = 120
Train A travels 120 miles during the two-hour period.
When using the distance formula, you have to pay attention to the units of measurement.
Remember the apples-and-oranges rule (see the “Identifying the information you need” sec-
tion, earlier in this chapter). If rate (r) is expressed in kilometers per hour, your result (d) will
be kilometers. If rate (r) is expressed as miles per second, you must either convert it to mph,
or you must convert time (t) to seconds.
The rate of travel for train B is 70 mph, and it also travels for two hours:
d = 70 × 2
d = 140
Train B travels 140 miles during the two-hour period.
Train A is 120 miles from the station and train B is 140 miles from the station, in the opposite
direction. The two trains are 120 + 140 = 260 miles apart.
Traveling in the same direction
If the two trains are traveling in the same direction as each other, but at different rate of
speeds, one travels farther in the same time than the other travels. The distance between the
two trains is the difference between the distance traveled by train A and the distance trav-
eled by train B.
121
Chapter 10: Working with Word Problems
You know what they say about assuming . . .
Math word problems require you to make basic assump-
tions. In the train problem in the “Traveling away from
each other” section, you’re to assume that both trains
travel at a constant rate of speed. You’re supposed to
ignore the fact that they may slow down for a curve, or
that it will probably take them a little time to get up to
cruising speed.
If a question gives you the average daily output of a fac-
tory and asks you what the output will be in a year, you’re
supposed to assume that the year is 365 days long.
If you’re asked how high the kite is flying 300 feet away
from you, you must assume that the ground is perfectly
level.
If . . . well, you get the point.

Train A travels north at 60 mph. Train B also travels north, on a parallel track, at 70 mph.
If both trains leave the station at the same time, how far apart will they be at the end of
two hours?
From the calculations you’ve already done (see the preceding section), you know that train A
traveled 120 miles, and train B traveled 140 miles. However, because they were traveling
in the same direction, to find the distance between them, you subtract, instead of add: 
140 – 120 = 20. The two trains are 20 miles apart.
Traveling at 90-degree angles
Travel that involves two people or things moving at 90-degree angles, then stopping, then
asking you what the distance is (as the crow flies) between the two people or things require
the use of the distance formula and a little basic geometry.
Train A travels north at 60 mph. Train B travels east at 70 mph. Both trains travel for
two hours. A bee flies from train A and lands on train B. Assuming the bee flew in a straight
line, how far did the bee travel between the two trains?
Through the skull sweat you’ve already done (see the “Traveling away from each other” sec-
tion, earlier in this chapter), you know that Train A traveled 120 miles and Train B traveled a
distance of 140 miles.
Because the trains are traveling at 90-degree angles (one north and one east), the lines of
travel form two sides of a right triangle. Figure 10-1 should make this easy to visualize.
The Pythagorean theorem says that if you know the length of two sides of a right triangle,
you can find the length of the third side by using the formula a2 + b2 = c2:
1202 + 1402 = c2
14,400 + 19,600 = c2
c = 184.39
The bee will have to fly 184.39 miles.
Finding the square root of a very large number can be a daunting task. When you reach this
point of the equation, it’s often easier just to square the possible answers to see which one
works.

Part III: Calculating Better Math Knowledge 

Investment/loan problems
These problems are primarily focused on simple interest rates for investments and loans,
using the formula I = prt, where I is the interest, p is the principal, r is the rate of interest (in
percentage), and t is the time.
The investment/loan problems you’ll see on the Arithmetic Reasoning subtest are pretty
simple. They’re nowhere near as difficult as similar situations in real life, where interest is
compounded.
To solve these problems, replace what is known in the interest formula, and then solve for
anything else.
John invests $1,500 for three years at an annual interest rate of 7 percent. How much will John
have at the end of the three-year period?
Plug the known information into the interest formula, I = prt:
I = $1,500 × 0.07 × 3
I = $315
Percent means “part of 100.” To convert percentage into a decimal, divide the percentage by 
100. So, 
. To convert a decimal into percentage, multiply by 100. So, 
0.07 = 0.07 × 100 = 7 percent. (See Chapter 8 for more information about working with per-
centages and decimals.)
John will make $315 in interest. Added to his original investment of $1,500, John will have a
total of $1,500 + $315 = $1,815.
That was pretty easy, so let me throw another one at you.
You invest $700, and after five years you receive a total of $900. What was the annual interest
rate?
On the surface, this one looks a bit more complicated, but you solve it the same way: Plug
what is known into the interest formula, I = prt, and solve for the rest.
You invested $700 and received $900. Therefore, you made $900 – $700 = $200 in interest.
$200 = $700 × r × 5
$200 = $3,500r
r = 0.057
Expressed as a percentage, this is 0.057 × 100 = 5.7 percent
Mixture problems
Mixture problems involve mixing different items at different costs, and determining the final
cost of the mixture. They can also involve mixing various solutions and determining percent-
ages of the solution mixture. This sounds difficult, but it’s really pretty easy when you know
how. Are you ready to try a couple?
123
Chapter 10: Working with Word Problems

How many quarts of a 70 percent alcohol solution must be added to 50 quarts of a 40 percent
alcohol solution to produce a 50 percent alcohol solution?
Let x = the number of quarts of 70 percent solution needed. The amount of alcohol contained
in x quarts of the 70 percent solution is represented by 0.7x. (Remember how to convert a
percentage into a decimal?)
There are 50 quarts of the 40 percent solution, so the amount of alcohol contained in those
50 quarts is represented by 50 × 0.4 = 20 quarts.
The total number of quarts of solution can be represented as 50 + x (the number of quarts of
40 percent solution, plus the unknown number of quarts of 70 percent solution). It will con-
tain 50 percent of the amount of total alcohol, so 0.5(50 + x).
Maybe the following chart will make this a bit clearer:

The third column of the table gives you your equation: 0.7x + 20 = 0.5(50 + x).
0.7x + 20 = 25 + 0.5x
0.7x = 5 + 0.5x
0.7x – 0.5x = 5
0.2x = 5
x = 25
The final mixture will require 25 quarts of 70 percent solution.
A grocery store wants to offer a mixture of white and dark grapes to sell for $4.20 per pound.
If white grapes cost $3 per pound, and dark grapes retail for $6 per pound, how many pounds
of dark grapes should the grocer add to 12 pounds of white grapes to produce the desired
mixture?
Let x = the pounds of dark grapes. The total amount of grapes will be the pounds of white
grapes (12), plus the unknown pounds of dark grapes (x), or 12 + x. The total cost of white
grapes at $3 per pound is 12 × 3 = $36.
Dark grapes sell for $6 per pound, so their total cost is represented as 6x.
The total cost of the mixture is to be $4.20 per pound, so this can be represented as 4.2(12 + x).
124
Part III: Calculating Better Math Knowledge 

The table worked so well in the last problem, I want to use one again:

$3 × 12 = $36
Dark

$6x
Mixture
$4.20
12 + x
$4.20(12 + x)
Again, the last column gives you your equation: 36 + 6x = 4.2(12 + x).
36 + 6x = 50.4 + 4.2x
6x – 4.2x = 50.4 – 36
1.8x = 14.4
x = 8
The mixture will require 8 pounds of dark grapes.
Percent problems
Percent problems involve working with percentages, such as discount savings, pay raises,
and such. You’ll often see them on the Arithmetic Reasoning subtest. They’re relatively
simple to solve.
Leroy makes $8.95 per hour. He’s such a good worker, his boss gives him a 25 percent raise.
How much per hour does Leroy make now?
To find the dollar amount of the raise, multiply Leroy’s previous salary by the decimal equiv-
alent of 25 percent: $8.95 × 0.25 = 2.237. Round this up to $2.24, just to make Leroy smile. Now
add the raise to Leroy’s original salary: $8.95 + $2.24 = $11.19.
Katie is very excited. For only $45, she bought a blouse that usually sells for $60. What per-
cent was her discount?
Divide the new price by the original price: 45 ÷ 60 = 0.75. The new price is 75 percent of the
original price, which means Katie’s discount is 25 percent.
Work problems
These problems involve two or more people or things working together. You’re expected to
figure out how long it will take them to complete a task together.
Patrick can build a wall in five hours. Dennis can build the same wall in seven hours. How
long will it take them to build the wall together?
125
Chapter 10: Working with Word Problems

There’s a general formula to solve such work problems. It’s 
, where a is the time it 
takes the first person or thing to do the job and b is the time it takes the second person
or thing to do the job.
It takes Patrick five hours to build the wall, and Dennis seven hours. Plugging the data into
the work formula:
It will take them 
hours to build the wall together.
Wasn’t that fun? I bet you’re eager to try another one.
One hose can fill an aboveground pool in three hours. Another hose will fill it in six hours.
How long will it take to fill the pool using both hoses?
Just plug the numbers into your handy-dandy work equation:
It will take two hours to fill the pool using both hoses.
Number problems
Number problems are pretty straightforward. The questions ask you to manipulate numbers
using basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. Most people find these types of
word problems to be pretty easy.
Do you want to try a few, just to get your feet wet? Sure, you do.
Jesse is a bartender at a local pub. On Friday, he made $27.40 in tips, on Saturday he made
$34.70 in tips, and on Sunday he made $7 less than he made on Friday. How much in tips did
Jesse earn during the three days?
See what I mean? Pretty straightforward. Jesse made $27.40 + $34.70 + ($27.40 – $7) = $82.50
in tips.
Rob “Speedy Gonzalez” Barton ran 1.5 miles in 9:57. The next day he ran it in 10:02. On the
third day, he ran it in 10:07. What is his average time for the 1.5-mile run?
First, convert all the times into seconds, just to make the math a little easier:
9:57 = (9 × 60) + 57 = 597 seconds
10:02 = (10 × 60) + 2 = 602 seconds
10:07 = (10 × 60) + 7 = 607 seconds
Add the seconds together: 597 + 602 + 607 = 1,806 seconds. Now, divide by the number of
times Rob ran the 1.5-mile run (3 times) to discover that his average speed is 1,806 ÷ 3 = 602
seconds. Finally, convert the seconds to minutes by dividing by 60: 602 ÷ 60 = 10 minutes,
with 2 seconds left over. Rob’s average time for the 1.5-mile run is 6:02.

Part III: Calculating Better Math Knowledge 

The sum of two consecutive odd positive numbers is 112. What are the numbers?
You may remember from the “Addition keywords” section, earlier in this chapter, that sum
means addition. Let n = the first number. That means that n + 2 = the second number
(because they’re consecutive odd numbers). Here’s your equation:
n + (n + 2) = 112
Solve for n:
2n + 2 = 112
2n = 110
n = 55
The first number is 55. The second number is 55 + 2 = 57.

Chapter 11
The Arithmetic Reasoning Subtest
In This Chapter

 Keeping an eye on the clock
 Getting the best score even when you’re stuck
 Trying your hand at some practice questions
T
here are two math subtests on the ASVAB, and both of them are used when computing
your AFQT score. Of the two, the Arithmetic Reasoning subtest is the more difficult for
most people.
Among other things, math word problems measure your reasoning skills. That’s why the mili-
tary services put so much emphasis on this particular subtest. They want recruits who can
figure things out — recruits who can solve problems.
If you’re starting to get nervous, just remember: You’ve been doing arithmetic word problems
since the third grade. Sure, they’re a little more difficult than when Mrs. Grundy was telling
you that you had three apples and gave one to Tammy, but the fact is, this is not new material
for you. You’ve done it before. The military is just asking you to do it again, that’s all.
I’m here to help you get ready. In this chapter, I tell you what you can expect on the Arithmetic
Reasoning subtest, give you a few methods that may help improve your score and get you
through those rough spots, and then — just for fun — toss a few practice questions at you.
Don’t worry — I toss them underhand.
Looking At the Test Structure
The Arithmetic Reasoning subtest is the second subtest on the ASVAB, right after the General
Science subtest. Therefore, it’s the first subtest you’ll encounter on the ASVAB that affects
your AFQT score.
The Arithmetic Reasoning subtest asks you to read a word problem, determine what the
question is asking, and select the correct answer. (Then you have to repeat the process 29
more times.) Most of the problems look like this:
Jane walks 5 miles to work each morning and 5 miles home each evening. How many miles
does Jane walk in a day?
(A) 6 miles
(B) 8 miles
(C) 7 miles
(D) 10 miles

You have 36 minutes to answer 30 questions, so you have to work quickly to finish, but
you’re not being tested on speed. You don’t get extra points for finishing the subtest early.
You’ll see a mixture of hard questions, medium questions, and easy questions on this subtest.
The hard ones are worth more points than the medium ones, which are worth more points
than the easy ones. If you’re taking the computerized version of the ASVAB (see Chapter 2),
and you’re really good at math word problems, you may only see hard questions. The com-
puter automatically selects the question difficulty based on how you answered the previous
question.
The test administrator will supply you with scratch paper so that you can work out some of
the problems on paper, if necessary.
Those dirty communists who make up the rules don’t allow the use of calculators on the
ASVAB. All you’re allowed is your brain, your trusty No. 2 pencil, and a piece of scratch
paper. If you’re lucky, they may let you sneak in your thinking cap.
Developing a Test Strategy
The U.S. military doesn’t win wars without a strategy, and you should have a set strategy for
conquering the Arithmetic Reasoning subtest. A strategy is more than “I’ll try to solve all the
problems quickly and correctly.” That’ll work fine if everything goes right and you know how
to solve the questions instantly when you see them, but it probably won’t work that way.
Your strategy needs to include plans to keep things going smoothly, as well as ideas of what
to do if things start going wrong.
Keeping track of the time
This chapter is supposed to be about the Arithmetic Reasoning subtest, so I think it’s time
for a practice question. Ready?
You have to take a test consisting of 30 multiple-choice questions. You have 36 minutes to
complete the test. How much time do you have for each question?
(A) 1 minute, 12 seconds
(B) 90 seconds
(C) 1 minute
(D) 1 minute 20 seconds
First, convert the minutes to seconds, so you won’t have to deal with fractions or decimals:
36 × 60 = 2,160 seconds. Now, divide the total number of seconds by the number of test ques-
tions: 2,160 ÷ 30 = 72 seconds. You have 72 seconds, or 1 minute and 12 seconds to complete
each question.
That’s not much time, considering that you’re expected to read the question, determine what
the question is asking, translate the problem into mathematical equations, solve those equa-
tions, and then answer the question — and, if you have time, check your answer.
If you’re taking the paper version of the ASVAB, there will be a large clock, clearly visible
somewhere on the wall. The test proctor will also post the start time and end time of the sub-
test where you can easily see it.
130
Part III: Calculating Better Math Knowledge 

If you’re taking the computerized version of the ASVAB, the time remaining for the subtest
will be clicking down right there on your computer screen.
Don’t spend too much time on any one question. If a question is stumping you, admit defeat,
choose an answer (see the “Logical guessing” section, later in this chapter), and move on.
You don’t want to find yourself in a position where you only have 15 minutes left, and you’re
on question 3.
Choosing an answer and checking it twice
In Chapter 10, I mention that it’s always a good idea to check your answer to ensure it makes
sense in relation to the question, if you have time. You won’t always have time on the
Arithmetic Reasoning subtest, but if you find yourself running ahead of the clock, take a
few seconds extra to check your answer.
Don’t assume that just because the answer you got is one of the possible answer choices,
that it’s the correct answer. Those crafty test makers often use common mistakes as possible
answer choices.
If you’re taking the paper version of the ASVAB, you should also leave enough time at the end
of the subtest to check and make sure you’ve marked your answer sheet correctly. Make sure
the answer blocks are completely filled in, and make sure you didn’t make the rookie mistake
of answering the wrong question with the right answer.
Using the answer choices: There’s more 
than one way to skin an equation
If you’re stumped and just can’t seem to write equations to solve the problem, you can often
answer the question by seeing which of the answer choices work. Look at the following
example:
The product of two consecutive negative even integers is 24. Find the smallest number.
(A) –2
(B) –4
(C) –6
(D) –7
Correctly solving this problem involves factoring a quadratic equation (see the end of this
section, in case you’re interested). Perhaps quadratic equations aren’t your cup of tea, and
you get stuck at n2 + 2n – 24 = 0. (If so, Chapter 8 may be of some help.) But, before giving up
and making a wild guess, try seeing which of the answer choices work.
 –2: There is no negative even integer larger than –2, so that choice won’t work.
 –4: –4 × –2 = 8, so that choice doesn’t work.
 –6: –6 × –4 = 24. It works!
Don’t use this method unless you’re absolutely stuck. It uses up a lot of time. In essence,
you’re computing the problem (up to) four times.
131
Chapter 11: The Arithmetic Reasoning Subtest

Thought I forgot about the original problem? Here’s the proper way to solve it:
(n)(n + 2) = 24
n2 + 2n = 24
n2 + 2n – 24 = 0
(n + 6)(n – 4) = 0
n = –6 and n = 4
The answer can’t be 4, because the problem asks for a negative number. The first number
(the smallest) is –6, which means the second number (n + 2) is –4.
Logical guessing
Sometimes nothing else works, and you just have to guess. If you’re taking the paper version
of the ASVAB, you can always skip the hard questions and go back to them when you
finish the other questions. If you choose to do so, remember to leave enough time to go
back and answer, even if your answer is “eeny, meeny, minee, mo.” There is no penalty for
wrong answers on the ASVAB. If you get the question wrong, you get zero points. If you leave
the answer blank, you also get zero points. If you make a wild guess, you have at least a one
in four chance of getting the answer right and getting points. If you leave it blank, you have a
0 percent chance of getting any points for that question.
If you’re taking the computerized version of the ASVAB, you can’t leave the answer blank.
The computer won’t present you with the next question until you answer the current one
with A, B, C, or D. Unfortunately, that means you don’t have the option of going back and
giving the question another try when you finish the rest of the subtest. You have to decide
whether to use more of your precious time to figure it out, or guess and move on.
Keep an eye on the clock. (See the “Keeping track of time” section, earlier in this chapter.)
Guessing doesn’t have to be wild, however. Sometimes you can improve your chances by
eliminating obviously wrong answers. Take another look at one of my previous brain
stumpers:
The product of two consecutive negative even integers is 24. Find the smallest number.
(A) –2
(B) –4
(C) –6
(D) –7
A is obviously incorrect, because there is no number larger than –2 that would be both nega-
tive and even. You can quickly see that D is wrong, because it’s an odd number, and the ques-
tion is asking for a negative even number. Now, if you have to guess, you’ve just changed the
odds from a one in four chance to a 50/50 chance.
132
Part III: Calculating Better Math Knowledge 

Taking Arithmetic Reasoning out for a Spin
I promised you a chance to practice, and here it is. In this section, I give you ten fairly simple
math word problems, similar to what you’ll see on the Arithmetic Reasoning subtest.
Don’t worry about time — use these questions to get used to the general test structure and
to practice some of the things you learned in this chapter and Chapter 10. When you’re
ready, you can move on to the full-blown AFQT practice tests in the following chapters.
1. If apples are on sale at 15 for $3, what is the cost of each apple?
(A) 50¢
(B) 25¢
(C) 20¢
(D) 30¢
The correct answer is C. Divide $3 by 15.
2. A noncommissioned officer challenged her platoon of 11 enlisted women to beat her record
of performing a 26-mile training run in four hours. If all the enlisted women match her
record, how many miles will they have run?
(A) 71.5 miles
(B) 6.5 miles
(C) 286 miles
(D) 312 miles
The correct answer is C. Multiply 26 × 11. The other information in the question is irrelevant —
it’s there to throw you off.
3. Margaret gets her hair cut and colored at an expensive salon in town. She is expected to
leave a 15 percent tip for services. If a haircut is $45 and a color treatment is $150, how
much of a tip should Margaret leave?
(A) $22.50
(B) $29.25
(C) $20.00
(D) $195.00
The correct answer is B. Add $45 and $150 and multiply the answer by 15 percent, or 0.15.
4. A bag of sand holds 1 cubic foot of sand. How many bags of sand are needed to fill a square
sandbox measuring 5 feet long and 1 foot high?
(A) 5 bags
(B) 10 bags
(C) 15 bags
(D) 25 bags
The correct answer is D. The volume formula for a square or rectangular box is v = lwh, 
so v = 5 × 5 × 1 = 25 cubic feet. Each bag holds 1 cubic foot of sand.
133
Chapter 11: The Arithmetic Reasoning Subtest

5. The day Samantha arrived at boot camp, the temperature reached a high of 90 degrees in
the shade and a low of –20 at night in the barracks. What is the average between the high
and low temperatures for the day?
(A) 35 degrees
(B) 45 degrees
(C) 70 degrees
(D) 62 degrees
The correct answer is A. Add the two temperatures given — 90 + –20 — and then divide by
the number of terms, 2: (90 + –20) ÷ 2 = 70 ÷ 2 = 35.
6. Farmer Beth has received an offer to sell her 320-acre farm for $3,000 per acre. She agrees
to give the buyer $96,000 worth of land. What fraction of Farmer Beth’s land is the buyer
getting?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
The correct answer is B. $96,000 divided by $3,000 (the price per acre) equals 32 acres, and 
32 acres divided by 320 acres (the total size of the farm) equals 10 percent, or 
of the land.
7. A map is drawn so that 1 inch equals 3 miles. On the map, the distance from Kansas City to
Denver is 192.5 inches. How far is the roundtrip from Kansas City to Denver in miles?
(A) 192.5 miles
(B) 577.5 miles
(C) 385 miles
(D) 1,155 miles
The correct answer is D. Multiply 192.5 × 3 to get the distance in miles and then double the
answer to account for both legs of the trip.
8. Margaret and Julie can sell their tattoo parlor for $150,000. They plan to divide the proceeds
according to the ratio of the money they each invested in the business. Margaret put in the
most money, at a 3:2 ratio to Julie. How much money should Julie get from the sale?
(A) $50,000
(B) $30,000
(C) $60,000
(D) $90,000
The correct answer is C. According to the ratio, Margaret should get 
of the money and Julie 
should get 
of the money. The fractions are calculated by adding both sides of the ratio 
together (3 + 2 = 5) to determine the denominator. Each side of the ratio then becomes a 
numerator, so that Margaret’s investment can be shown to be 
of the total investment, and 
134
Part III: Calculating Better Math Knowledge 

Julie’s is 
of the total investment. (You can check these fractions by adding 
and 
to get 
or 1, which is all the money.) Divide $150,000 by 5, and then multiply the answer by 2 to
determine Julie’s share of the money.
9. In the military, 
of an enlisted person’s time is spent sleeping and eating, 
is spent 
standing at attention, 
is spent staying fit, and 
is spent working. The rest of the time is 
spent at the enlisted person’s own discretion. How many hours per day does this discre-
tionary time amount to?
(A) 6 hours
(B) 1.6 hours
(C) 2.4 hours
(D) 3.2 hours
The correct answer is C. Calculate this answer by first assigning a common denominator of 
60 to all the fractions and adjusting the numerators accordingly: 
, 
, 
, and 
. Add the 
fractions to find out how much time is allotted to all these tasks. The total is 
, which leaves 
or 
of the day to the enlisted person’s discretion. 
of 24 hours is 2.4 hours.
10. Train A is headed east at 55 mph. Train B is also heading east on an adjacent track at
70 mph. At the end of four hours, how much farther will train B have traveled than train A?
(A) 40 miles
(B) 50 miles
(C) 60 miles
(D) 70 miles
The correct answer is C. The distance formula is d = rt. Plug in the known values:
 Train A: d = 55 × 4 = 220 miles
 Train B: d = 70 × 4 = 280 miles
Train B traveled 280 – 220 = 60 miles farther than train A.

Part IV
AFQT Practice Exams

In this part . . .
S
coring high on the AFQT requires an effective study
plan. You want to concentrate your study time on
subject areas that you may be having problems with. The
practice exams in this part are great tools to use in order to
map out your study program. Take the first test in this part
to determine your strengths and weaknesses. Concentrate
most of your study efforts on the subject areas that are
hard for you. When you think you’ve got it down, take
the second and third tests to measure your improvement.
Take the last test right before you’re ready to take the
actual ASVAB, to brush up on your test-taking skills.
Because I like you, I also include four practice answer
score sheets. If you want, you can cut them out of the book
and use them to record your answers. Of course, if you got
this book from the library, you probably shouldn’t cut out
the answer sheets, or even mark on them. Librarians hate
it when that happens.
Taking the sample tests helps you understand where you
need to study, but it also gets you into the test-taking
mindset. By taking the tests, you get used to the format
of each subtest. Trust me — these sample tests give you
confidence on test day.

Chapter 12
Practice Exam 1
T
he Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) consists of four of the nine subtests given
on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB). The four subtests used
to determine your AFQT score are: Arithmetic Reasoning, Word Knowledge, Paragraph
Comprehension, and Mathematics Knowledge.
The AFQT score is very important. Although all the ASVAB subtests are used to determine
which military jobs you may qualify for, the AFQT score determines whether you’re even
qualified to join the military. All the military service branches have established minimum
AFQT scores, according to their needs (see Chapter 2 for more information).
The AFQT is not a stand-alone test (it’s part of the ASVAB), but, in this chapter, I present the
subtests applicable to the AFQT in the same order in which you’ll encounter them when you
take the actual ASVAB.
After you complete the entire practice test, check your answers against the answer key in
Chapter 13.
The test is scored by comparing your raw score to the scores of other people, which pro-
duces a scaled score. So just because you missed a total of 20 questions doesn’t mean that
your score is 80. (That would be too simple.) Turn to Chapter 2 to find out how the AFQT
score is derived from these four subtests.
Your goal in taking this practice test is to determine which areas you may still need to study.
If you miss only one question on the Word Knowledge subtest, but you miss 15 questions on
Arithmetic Reasoning, you probably want to devote some extra study time to developing
your math skills before you take the ASVAB.

Chapter 12: Practice Exam 1
Time: 36 minutes
30 questions
Directions: Arithmetic Reasoning is the second subtest of the ASVAB. These questions are designed
to test your ability to use mathematics to solve various problems that may be found in real life — in
other words, math word problems.
Each question is followed by four possible answers. Decide which answer is correct, and then mark
the corresponding space on your answer sheet. Use your scratch paper for any figuring you want to
do. You may not use a calculator.

Patrick was going to buy a car for $5,800.

Every American can be proud of the history
of the United States Army. The American Army
was created on June 14, 1775, when the
Continental Congress first authorized the muster
of troops to serve under its own authority. Those
soldiers came from the provincial forces of the
colonies, which were at that time laying siege to
Boston. From its birth, the American Army has
relied on the citizen soldier, exemplified by the
militia and the Minutemen who fought the British
at Lexington and Concord. Commanded by
General George Washington and supported by
our French allies, the Continental Army defeated
the British at Yorktown and secured the freedoms
so eloquently stated in the Declaration of
Independence.

safety devices. Always wear your seat belt. Place
all children under 13 in the rear seat. The rear
seat is the safest for children. If you have an air
bag on-off switch, check its position every time

Enlisted members commissioned as tempo-
rary officers after OCS graduation perform duties
and enjoy the privileges of regular commissioned
officers. They serve in a probationary period
of about four years to ensure a fair, accurate
appraisal of their capabilities over two or more
types of duty. Probation expires about the time
they are considered for promotion to lieutenant,
and selection under the “best qualified” system
amply indicates their qualification for permanent
status.

sion as a result of officer candidate school:
(A) remain enlisted until after a probation-
ary period
(B) perform essentially the same duties as
other commissioned officers
(C) remain on probation for six years
(D) return to enlisted status if they fail the

Hurricanes are severe tropical storms that
form in the southern Atlantic Ocean, the
Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the eastern
Pacific Ocean. A tornado, on the other hand, is a
violent, dangerous, rotating column of air that is
in contact with both the surface of the Earth and a
cumulonimbus cloud or, in rare cases, the base of
a cumulus cloud. Tornadoes come in many sizes
but are typically in the form of a visible condensa-
tion funnel, whose narrow end touches the Earth
and is often encircled by a cloud of debris and
dust. Tornadoes often develop from a class of
thunderstorms known as supercells. Supercells
contain mesocyclones, an area of organized rota-
tion a few miles up in the atmosphere, usually 1 to
6 miles (2 to 10 km) across. Most intense torna-
does (EF3 to EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale)
develop from supercells.

The military services shall design, implement,
supervise, and tailor physical-fitness programs to
suit the particular needs and mission of the
Department of Defense, and their respective serv-
ice, consistent with established scientific princi-
ples of physical conditioning. Service members
should exercise on a regular basis (that is, three to
five times each week) and to an intensity that pro-
vides a training effect. Individuals with injuries and
on medical profiles, shall be placed on a medically
approved exercise program only after consultation
with medical authorities. Pregnant service mem-
bers will engage in physical activity to maintain
cardiovascular and muscular fitness throughout
the pregnancy and postpartum period, in accor-
dance with medical guidance. Exercise regimens
will consist of routines that include physical train-
ing and nutritional counseling. Military services
shall extend their physical-fitness programs to
incorporate occupational-specific physical-fitness
requirements for those career fields where it is
deemed necessary to ensure adequate skill, per-
formance, and safety. This extension shall include
identifying each specific physical capability
needed by the occupational specialties. These
additional physical-fitness standards will include a
risk assessment for prevention of injuries and will
reflect levels of physical abilities necessary to
meet the duty demands of the occupation. Once
the levels or desired physical capabilities are iden-
tified, physical-fitness training and testing should
be linked to these capabilities. Emerging training
methodologies should be considered when design-
ing the appropriate physical-fitness training.

“Take the case of a person who attends to
the petty occupations of his everyday life with
mathematical precision. The objects around him,
however, have all been tampered with by a mis-
chievous wag, the result being that when he dips
his pen into the inkstand he draws it out all cov-
ered with mud, when he fancies he is sitting
down on a solid chair he finds himself sprawling
on the floor, in a word his actions are all topsy-
turvy or mere beating the air, while in every case
the effect is invariably one of momentum. Habit
has given the impulse: what was wanted was to
check the movement or deflect it. He did nothing
of the sort, but continued like a machine in the
same straight line.”

“It is very easy to learn how to speak and
write correctly, as for all purposes of ordinary
conversation and communication, only about
2,000 different words are required. The mastery
of just twenty hundred words, the knowing where
to place them, will make us not masters of the
English language, but masters of correct speaking
and writing. Small number, you will say, com-
pared with what is in the dictionary! But nobody
ever uses all the words in the dictionary or could
use them did he live to be the age of Methuselah,
and there is no necessity for using them. There
are upwards of 200,000 words in the recent edi-
tions of the large dictionaries, but the one-hun-
dredth part of this number will suffice for all your
wants. Of course, you may think not, and you
may not be content to call things by their
common names; you may be ambitious to show
superiority over others and display your learning
or, rather, your pedantry and lack of learning.
For instance, you may not want to call a spade
a spade. You may prefer to call it a spatulous
device for abrading the surface of the soil. Better,
however, to stick to the old, familiar, simple name
that your grandfather called it. It has stood the
test of time, and old friends are always good
friends.”

There are the subordinates who are both
competent and committed to their jobs. They
know what to do and are enthusiastic about doing
it. These are the individuals the leader tasks to
develop or implement new procedures, informing
the leader only of their progress. Projects may be
delegated to these subordinates, and they should
be allowed to make the decisions that will ensure
task accomplishment. Low-supportive and low-
directive behavior is appropriate because follow-
ers are both committed to and competent on the
task.

Practice Exam 1: Answers and
Explanations

id you do well on the first practice exam? I sure hope so! Use this answer key to score
the practice exam in Chapter 12. If you don’t do well, don’t worry — there are three
more full-length practice tests in this book to help you hone your English and math skills.
The AFQT isn’t scored based on number correct, number wrong, or even percent of ques-
tions correct. Instead, the score is derived by comparing your raw score with the raw score
of others who have taken the test before you. In determining the raw score, harder questions
are worth more points than easier questions. (For more on scoring, turn to Chapter 2.)
Don’t waste time trying to equate your score on this practice test with your potential score
on the actual AFQT. It can’t be done. Instead, use the results of this practice test to determine
which areas you should devote more study time to.
Part 1: Arithmetic Reasoning
Mathematical word problems can be tough. You have to develop a skill for determining
which factors are relevant to the problem and then be able to convert those factors into a
mathematical formula to arrive at a correct solution. Yikes! No wonder so many math books
are on the market! A few good ones that may help are Math Word Problems For Dummies,
Algebra I For Dummies, and Algebra II For Dummies, all by Mary Jane Sterling; Geometry For
Dummies, 2nd Edition, and Calculus For Dummies, both by Mark Ryan; and SAT II Math For
Dummies, by Scott Hatch, JD, and Lisa Zimmer Hatch, MA — all published by Wiley.
Reviewing Chapters 8 and 10 and the additional practice questions in Chapter 11 may also
help. Finally, Chapters 20 and 21 may help you improve your scores.
1. (C) There are two possibilities (R and P) for the first character. There are ten possible
choices (0 through 9) for the second and third characters. There are 26 letters in the alpha-
bet, so there are 26 possible choices for the last characters. Applying the multiplication
principle, you get 2 × 10 × 10 × 26 = 5,200.
I don’t really have a town named after me, but it could happen.
2. (A) You want to find out Patty’s daughter’s age, so let d = daughter’s age. You know that
Patty is 45 and her age is 15 years more than twice the daughter’s age. This can be
expressed mathematically as 45 = 2d + 15. The rest is simply skull-sweat.

3. (C) John needs to make the cost of his expenses, plus the cost of the new computer:
$3,280 + $693 + ($452 × 4) = $3,280 + $693 + $1,808 = $5,781. Each fare averages $7, so, to find 
the number of fares: 
. Because a fraction of a fare isn’t practical, round this up 
to 826 fares.
4. (D) Let x = the number of nickels. That means 2x = the number of quarters. All of Jeanie’s
coins total $8.25 or 825 cents. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
Jeanie has 15 nickels.
Because she has twice as many quarters, she has 30 quarters.
5. (A) First, compute the total cost of the cash plan: $5,800 + 10 percent = $5,800 + $580 =
$6,380.
The total cost of the payment plan would be $1,000 + ($230 × 24) = $6,520.
The cash plan is the better deal.
6. (B) Let x = the amount of walnuts in a pound. That means 1 – x = the pounds of almonds. In
a pound of the mixture, walnuts cost $4.50x and almonds cost $7(1 – x). Together a pound
of the mixture costs $6. So:
7. (B) Let w = the width of the rectangle. That means the length = w + 4. The area formula for a
rectangle is a = lw. Substitute the known values:
60 = (w + 4)w
60 = w2 + 4w
0 = w2 + 4w – 60
Guess what? This is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as follows:
0 = (w – 6)(w + 10)
w = 6, –10
Because a rectangle with a negative width isn’t much use, the width of this rectangle is
6 inches.
8. (D) Converting to seconds, it took Rod 60 + 10 = 70 seconds to run the 200-meter dash, and
60 + 30 = 90 seconds to run the hurdles. Then, 90 – 70 = 20 seconds.
Rod really can run faster than a speeding bullet.

9. (C) Let s = the length of the shortest side. That means that the two other sides are 2s and 
s + 8. The perimeter formula for a triangle is p = s1 + s2 + s3. Substitute the known values:
10. (A) First, total the number of miles that Timothy drove: 321 + 290 + 303 = 914. Next, find the
sum of the amount of gas he used: 9.3 + 7.6 + 8.3 = 25.2. Finally, divide the total miles driven
by the amount of gas used:
How about that? Timothy found an honest car salesman.
11. (D) There are 12 marbles, which means there are 12 possible outcomes. Nine of the marbles
are not yellow, which means there are 9 favorable outcomes. This can be shown as a ratio:
9:12, or chances of 9 in 12.
12. (B) This is a relatively simple problem, just to see if you’re still paying attention. The prob-
lem can be solved in a few simple steps.
First, total the number of cards Pete had originally: 27 + 21 + 24 = 72.
Next, find the number of cards he gave away: 6 + 21 = 27.
Subtract the number of cards given away from the total number of cards: 72 – 27 = 45.
Pete has 45 cards left, each worth $11: 45 × $11 = $495.
13. (C) This problem actually makes up the parts of a right triangle. Take a look at the following
figure.
The Pythagorean theorem says that if you know the length of two sides of a right triangle,
you can figure out the length of the third by using the formula, a2 + b2 = c2.

Chapter 13: Practice Exam 1: Answers and Explanations

The 500-foot string forms the hypotenuse, so the equation reads 3002 + x2 = 5002. Solve for x:
It wouldn’t be possible to have a weather balloon flying 400 feet under the ground, so use
the positive solution.
14. (C) Let x = Laura’s age. Since Patricia is twice as old as Laura, her age can be expressed as
2x. In three years, Laura will be x + 3, and Patricia will be 2x + 3. In three years, the sum of
their ages will be 42. You can now set up the equation:
Since Laura is 12, and Patricia is twice as old as Laura, Patricia is 24 years old.
15. (A) First, multiply the height of the stack by 12 to convert the feet into inches: 10 × 12 = 120
inches.
Next, divide the height (in inches) by the thickness of each piece of lumber: 
.
The stack is 30 pieces of lumber high, but there are 4 pieces of lumber in each layer, so: 
30 × 4 = 120.
16. (D) First, 15 percent of $18.45 is $2.77 (you get that by multiplying $18.45 × 0.15 = $2.77).
Dinner plus tip cost Rod $18.45 + $2.77 = $21.22. Out of $40, Rod should get back $40.00 –
$21.56 = $18.78 in change.
17. (A) Subtract the original salary from the new salary to get the difference: $360 – $320 = $40.
Then divide the difference in salary ($40) by the original salary ($320) to determine the per-
cent increase:
18. (B) A simple annual interest rate of 7 percent would be 14 percent for two years: 7 percent ×
2 = 14 percent. Then 14 percent of $1,500 is $210 (you get that by multiplying $1,500 × 0.14 =
$210). With principle and interest, Robin owes $1,500 + $210 = $1,710.
19. (B) The first person can have any date for a birthday. That makes the probability of him
having a birthday during the year 100 percent or 365 chances out of 365 possibilities. As a
radio, this is expressed as 365:365.
The chance that the second person has the same birthday is 1 out of 365 or 1:365.
To find the probability that both people have the same birthday, express the ratios as frac-
tions and multiply them together:
20. (C) 8 pints make up a gallon, so a gallon contains 16 half-pints. One half-pint equals 
of a
gallon.

21. (B) The distance formula is d = rt, where d is the distance, r is the rate, and t is the time. In 
this case, you want to find out the time, so the formula can be restated as 
.
The trains are 260 miles away (distance) and their combined rate of speed is 70 mph +
60 mph = 130 mph.
You can now plug the known values into the distance formula:
Because the trains were 260 mph apart at 4 p.m., they will meet at 6 p.m.
22. (D) The distance formula is d = rt. You want to find the rate of speed, so the formula can be 
expressed as 
.
The time between point A and point B is 15 minutes (4:10 – 3:55 = 15 minutes). Between
these points, the rocket traveled 232 – 35 = 197 miles. You now have enough information to
plug into the formula:
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so to express the speed as mph, multiply by 60: 13.1333 ×
60 = 787.998. Round this up to 788.
23. (B) Twenty-eight percent of $35,000 is $9,800 (you get this by multiplying $35,000 × 0.28 =
$9,800). After deductions, the store manager’s take-home salary is $25,200. The store keeper
gets 52 percent of his deductions back at the end of the year: $9,800 × 0.52 = $5,096. Adding
what he gets back to his remaining take-home salary, $25,200 + $5,096 = $30,296.
24. (A) The area of a rectangle is determined from the formula a = lw. Substitute the known
values:
a = 8 × 14
a = 112
25. (C) In a two-child family, there are only four possible combinations: BB, BG, GB, or GG. You
already know that one child is a boy, so there can’t be two girls. That leaves the following
possibilities: BB, BG, GB. Two of those probabilities include girls, so the probability that the 
second child is a girl is .
26. (B) The computer depreciates by $587.50 the first year: $2,350 × 0.25 = $587.50. Thus, at the
end of the first year it’s worth $2,350 – $587.50 = $1,762.50. The next year it depreciates by
another $440.63: $1,762.50 × 0.25 = $440.63. The computer is now worth $1,762.50 – $440.63 =
$1,321.87.
27. (B) To find the area of a rectangle, the formula is a = lw.
The area of the patio is 12 × 14 = 168 square feet. The area of the porch is 8 × 10 = 80
square feet.
The total area to be painted is 80 + 168 = 248 square feet.
Since one can of paint will cover 48 square feet, divide the total area by the number of 
square feet each can will cover: 
. Because five cans won’t complete the job, Igor 
needs to buy six cans.
28. (D) Five percent of 20 is 1 (you get that by multiplying 20 × 0.05 = 1). Add that to the original
miles per gallon and the result is 20 + 1 = 21.
169
Chapter 13: Practice Exam 1: Answers and Explanations

29. (D) This problem sounds a lot more complicated than it really is. In fact, it’s a very, very old
word problem, designed to confuse. However, you can solve it relatively easily.
The distance formula is d = rt. This can also be expressed as 
.
Forget about the bee for a moment, and find out how long until the trains meet by plugging
the known values into the distance formula:
Because the trains are traveling for one hour, and the bee is moving at 50 mph, the bee
covers 50 miles in this time.
30. (B) The Pythagorean theorem states that you can find the length of any side of a right trian-
gle by using the formula a2 + b2 = c2. Plug in the known values:
Only the positive answer makes sense.

Part 3: Paragraph Comprehension
So, how did you do? I certainly hope you did very well on this subtest. If not, you may want
to engage in some more reading practice. Improving your vocabulary can also help improve
your reading comprehension skills — see Chapter 6 for some tips. You may also want to try a
few of the practice questions in Chapter 7.
1. (A) According to the passage, the American Army has relied on citizen-soldiers from its very
birth. Tanks, rifles, and strategy aren’t mentioned in the passage.
2. (B) The last sentence of the passage clearly states that the French allies supported the
Continental Army during their defeat of the British at Yorktown.
3. (B) The passage does not address the presidency of George Washington.
4. (A) The first sentence makes it clear that those in the rank of sergeant major hold the high-
est enlisted rank. The final sentence of the passage instructs on the proper address of those

5. (D) Although B and C may be true, these issues are not addressed by the passage.
6. (B) The last sentence states that automatic airbag switches should be in the off position for
young children, which indicates that airbags are unsafe for small children.
7. (C) The main point of the passage is to have an escape plan to help you get out of the house
quickly. The information concerning how quickly fires can get out of control is a subpoint,
designed to support the main point.
8. (B) The first sentence makes this clear.
9. (C) This is pointed out in the third sentence of the passage.
10. (D) The passage tells the reader that the service branches must establish physical-fitness
programs and directs some of the requirements of those programs.
11. (A) The passage makes it clear that each service branch will tailor fitness programs to meet

trusted.
Part 4: Mathematics Knowledge
This subtest would have been much easier if the ASVAB folks allowed you to use a calculator,
wouldn’t it? I mean, what are these folks, electronically challenged or something? Even so,
the problems on this subtest are designed so that they can be solved using only scratch
paper, the ol’ no. 2 pencil, and a little brain sweat.
If you’re still having difficulty, give Chapter 8 another gander. Algebra I For Dummies and
Algebra II For Dummies, both by Mary Jane Sterling; Geometry For Dummies, 2nd Edition, and
Calculus For Dummies, both by Mark Ryan; and SAT II Math For Dummies, by Scott Hatch, JD,
and Lisa Zimmer Hatch, MA (all published by Wiley) can also help you improve your math
knowledge score. You can find additional practice questions in Chapter 9.
1. (D) Insert the known value, 6, for x: 
.
2. (B) Isolate the y by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.25:
172
Part IV: AFQT Practice Exams 

3. (B) Begin by putting the problem into a fraction: 
. Now convert the fraction to a 
decimal: 0.081. Because percent means part of 100, move the decimal place two spaces to
the right to get the number expressed as a percent: 8.1 percent.
4. (A) An integer is divisible by a number if the sum of its digits is divisible by the same
number.
Add the known digits: 4 + 1 + 8 + 9 = 22
The next nearest multiple of 3 closest to 22 is 24: 3 × 8 = 24.
To find the missing digit, subtract 22 from 24: 24 – 22 = 2.
The missing digit is 2.
5. (B) A natural number is prime if it has exactly two factors: itself and 1. A natural number is
composite if it has three or more factors. The number 51 can be factored 2 ways: 51 × 1 and
17 × 3. Therefore, the factors of 51 are 51, 17, 3, and 1.
6. (B) Isolate the variable on one side of the equation by adding 7 to each side: 7 – 83 = t and 
t = –76.
7. (D) Isolate the variable on one side of the equation by multiplying both sides by 4:
8. (D) The sentence translates into an inequality.
9. (A) The area of a rectangle is determined by multiplying its length times its width. Set up an
equation as follows:
10. (B) Volume equals length × width × height. Because a cube has equal dimensions, find the
cube root of 216: 6 × 6 × 6 = 216.
11. (A) Convert the ratio into common units of measurement (you can’t compare apples to
oranges): 5 inches to 10 feet = 5 inches to 120 inches (there are 12 inches in 1 foot).
Express the ratio as a fraction: 
. Simplify: 
.
12. (C) Begin by putting the problem into a fraction: 
. Now convert the fraction to a decimal: 
0.125. Because percent means part of 100, move the decimal place two spaces to the right to
get the number expressed as a percent: 12.5 percent.
13. (C) Mean is another word for average. To find the mean of a series of numbers, add the num-
bers together, then divide the sum by the number of items: 17 + 27 + 52 + 81 + 93 = 270. 
There are a total of five numbers, so divide 270 by 5: 
.
14. (A) Substitute the value of y2 in the first equation, –1, into the second equation: [(–1)5]x = 1.
Simplify to: –1x = 1. To make –1 a positive number, the value of its exponent, x, has to be
even. The least positive even integer is 2.

15. (B) The figure shown is a cylinder and a cone. Therefore, compute the volume of each sepa-
rately, then add them together.
The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr2h. Substitute the known values:
V = π62 × 20
V = 3.14 × 36 × 20
V = 2,260.8
The formula for the volume of a cone is 
. Substitute the known values:
Add the volume of the cylinder and cone: 2,260.8 + 452.16 = 2,712.96. Because the possible
answer choices do not include decimals, round up.
16. (C) The first step is to convert the 
percent to a fractional number by dividing it by 100: 
. To find the percentage, use the formula, p = br. In this case, p is unknown, 
percent or 
, and r = 210:
Converting to a decimal, p = 0.3.
17. (B) Draw a vertical line from point B to the line representing the x-axis. The result is –4. Now
draw a horizontal line from point B to the line representing the y-axis. The result is –3.
18. (B) Draw a vertical line from point B to the line representing the x-axis. The result is –2. Now
draw a horizontal line from point B to the line representing the y-axis. The result is –3. The
x-coordinate is always written first.
19. (C) In Quadrant I, both coordinates are positive. In Quadrant II, the x-coordinate is negative
and the y-coordinate is positive. In Quadrant III, both coordinates are negative. In Quadrant
IV, the x-coordinate is positive and the y-coordinate is negative.
20. (C) Distribute the 4 by multiplying all parts of the equation in the parentheses by 4: 
4(7 + i) = (4 × 7) + (4 × i) = 28 + 4i.
21. (B) When performing division, the division of two negative numbers results in a positive
number.
22. (D) x2 = 0.49. Use the square root property: 
, or 
. Simplify: x = 0.7 or
x = –0.7.
23. (B) Simplify the problem: –13 –7 > k = –20 > k. Exchange the sides of the inequality and
reverse the inequality sign (transformation): k < –20.

24. (A) A number written in scientific notation is a number between 1 and 10 and a power of 10.
The power is negative because the original number was a fraction of 1.
25. (D) In a right triangle, the two shortest sides are the legs, and the longest side, which is
opposite the right angle, is the hypotenuse. The lengths of the legs are 8 inches and x
inches, and the length of the hypotenuse is 13 inches.
According to Pythagorean theorem, in a right triangle, if a and b are the lengths of the legs
and c is the length of the hypotenuse, then a2 + b2 = c2.
Substitute the known values:

Practice Exam 2
T
he Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) includes four subtests that
make up the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) score: Arithmetic Reasoning,
Word Knowledge, Paragraph Comprehension, and Mathematics Knowledge.
The military services use the AFQT score as an initial qualifier to determine whether the mili-
tary considers you to be “trainable.” Each service has established its own minimum score.
You can find much more information about how the AFQT is scored, and how the services
use those scores, in Chapter 2.
You can’t take the AFQT by itself. You have to take the entire ASVAB exam, which includes
nine total subtests. All the subtests of the ASVAB are used to determine military job qualifica-
tions, while the four subtests that make up the AFQT score are used to determine military
qualification.
After you complete the entire sample test, check your answers against the answer key in
Chapter 15. On the actual AFQT, hard questions are worth more points than easy questions,
so you can’t score your test by a simple number correct or number wrong. (Chapter 2
explains how the AFQT is scored.)
Use this test as a progress check after a week or two of study. Adjust your study plan
accordingly.

You’ll encounter the Arithmetic Reasoning subtest as the second subtest of the ASVAB, right after the
General Science subtest. The Arithmetic Reasoning subtest consists of story-type word problems.
Unfortunately, the ASVAB powers-that-be have dictated that you are not allowed to use a calculator.
Don’t worry — the problems are designed so that they can be solved with the use of pencil and
scratch paper.
Each question is followed by four possible answers. Decide which answer is correct and then mark
the corresponding space on your answer sheet. Use your scratch paper for any figuring you want
to do.

When you take the ASVAB, you’ll encounter the Word Knowledge subtest immediately after the
Arithmetic Reasoning subtest. What is “word knowledge”? It’s essentially a vocabulary test. You’ll
be presented with a question with an underlined word — sometimes the word is used in a sen-
tence, and sometimes it isn’t. You are to select the choice that best defines the underlined word. If
the underlined word is used in a sentence, select the answer as best defines the word, as used in
that sentence. Each question is followed by four possible answers. Decide which answer is correct
and then mark the corresponding space on your answer sheet.

Patrick claimed to be late because of heavy
traffic on the freeway. Even though I have my
doubts, his explanation is plausible. I got stuck
on the same road just last week. I guess I’ll just
have to take his word for it.

The Air Force Aid Society (AFAS) is the offi-
cial charity of the U.S. Air Force. It promotes the
Air Force mission by helping “to relieve distress
of Air Force members and their families and
assisting them to finance their education.” It is
rooted in the original Army Air Corps and the
World War II Army Air Forces, whose members
wanted to “take care of their own.” Through the
years, AFAS has become increasingly effective in
helping individuals with personal emergencies —
as well as extremely useful when used by com-
manders to help solve personnel problems in
their units.

Living in the United States does not automati-
cally make one an American citizen. Residents of
the United States can be aliens, nationals, or citi-
zens. Aliens are people who have emigrated from
a foreign country. They have some of the same
freedoms and legal rights as U.S. citizens, but
they cannot vote in elections. American nationals
are natives of American territorial possessions.
They have all the legal protections that citizens
have, but they do not have the full political rights
of U.S. citizens. Persons born in the U.S. or born
to U.S. citizens in foreign countries are automati-
cally citizens of the United States. Persons born
in other countries who want to become citizens
must apply for and pass a citizenship test. Those
who become citizens in this manner are natural-
ized citizens.
7.
According to the passage:
(A) America has the most freedoms of any
country in the world.
(B) Aliens, nationals, and citizens all share
the same freedom and political rights.
(C) American nationals do not share the
same political rights as citizens.
(D) It is very hard to become a citizen of
the United States.
War’s political nature, physical stress, and
agony of combat will outlive any desire to make it
bloodless and free of violence, despite a revolu-
tion in military affairs caused by technology. The
means may change, but the fundamental nature
and risks of war will remain.
8.
The main point of the passage could be
stated as:
(A) War is hell.
(B) War will never go away.
(C) Technology makes war easier.
(D) None of the above.
Leaders prepare for challenges through their
career-long study and application of the art of
leadership. Successful leaders generally exhibit
common character traits and embrace tried-and-
true leadership principles. You should strive
to develop and hone your skills, build on expert-
ise in your career specialty, learn from others’
experiences, and observe your environment.
Throughout your career you should read,
observe others’ actions, solicit advice, and
become attuned to the myriad of social, eco-
nomic, and political factors that shape your
occupation and the world.
9.
According to the passage:
(A) All leaders are different.
(B) Leadership takes hard work and study.
(C) Leaders are natural born.
(D) Timing is of the utmost importance in
applying leadership principles.

“Standing before the press, which faced the
windows, Dr. Pascal was looking for a paper that
he had come in search of. With doors wide open,
this immense press of carved oak, adorned with
strong and handsome mountings of metal, dating
from the last century, displayed within its capa-
cious depths an extraordinary collection of
papers and manuscripts of all sorts, piled up in
confusion and filling every shelf to overflowing.
For more than 30 years the doctor had thrown
into it every page he wrote, from brief notes to
the complete texts of his great works on heredity.
Thus, it was that his searches here were not
always easy. He rummaged patiently among the
papers, and when he at last found the one he was
looking for, he smiled.”
—Emile Zola

Internships: self-directed learning, a part-
time job or an invaluable first step toward a
public service career? Internships today go well
beyond résumé building. They are about experi-
ence building, networking, and learning.
Interested in a career in foreign policy? Intern at
the State Department and develop research skills
and firsthand knowledge. Interested in children’s
policy? An internship with the Children’s Defense
Fund will help establish a network of contacts for
the future. A truly educational internship offers
hands-on experience in the work of a particular
profession. You not only perform invaluable sup-
port to an agency or organization, but you are
learning skills to apply to your future career and
your course work.

Personal time management is about control-
ling the use of the most valuable (and underval-
ued) resource — time. The absence of time
management is characterized by last-minute
rushes to meet deadlines, meetings that either
are double booked or achieve nothing, days that
seem somehow to slip unproductively by, and
crises that loom unexpectedly from nowhere.
This sort of environment leads to inordinate
stress and performance degradation. Because
personal time management is a management
process, it must be planned, monitored, and regu-
larly reviewed.
14.
Lack of proper time management can lead to:
(A) stress
(B) rushing through projects
(C) unproductive meetings
(D) All of the above
15.
According to the passage, time management:
(A) should happen naturally
(B) should be discussed at all levels of
supervision
(C) is the most important leadership prac-
tice of them all
(D) should be worked out in advance

Practice Exam 2: Answers and
Explanations
T
wo AFQT practice tests down, and two to go! I hope you’re starting to get a handle on
the test structure and the question types. Ready to find out how you’re doing? The
answers and explanations in the following sections help you determine how well you per-
formed on the practice test in Chapter 14 — and give you some hints about where you may
have dropped a decimal point or two. Don’t worry, it happens to the best of us.
Don’t focus too much on scores. On the actual AFQT, harder questions are worth more
points than easier questions. The AFQT is one of those rare tests on which you can miss
some questions and still max out your test score. As always, use the results to decide where
you want to concentrate your study time. Do you need more work on math or reading/verbal
skills? This chapter helps you find out.
Part 1: Arithmetic Reasoning
The Arithmetic Reasoning subtest is not only one of the important subtests that make up
the AFQT, but it’s also used as a qualification factor for many of the military jobs you can
choose from. You may want to glance at ASVAB For Dummies by yours truly (published by
Wiley) to see which military jobs require you to do well on this subtest. If you missed more
than five or six questions, it’s time to dig out that old high school math textbook and wrap
your brain around some math problems. Chapters 8 and 10 may also help you out. Some
other great books that may help you score better on this subtest include Math Word
Problems For Dummies, Algebra I For Dummies, and Algebra II For Dummies, all by Mary Jane
Sterling; Geometry For Dummies, 2nd Edition, and Calculus For Dummies, both by Mark Ryan;
and SAT II Math For Dummies, by Scott Hatch, JD, and Lisa Zimmer Hatch, MA — all published
by Wiley.
1. (C) Let x = the number of yellow marbles. That means red marbles = 2x, green marbles = 3x,
and purple marbles = 2(2x), or 4x. There are 100 marbles in the jar, so:
x + 2x + 3x + 4x = 100
10x = 100
x = 10
2. (A) Don’t let the number of miles traveled confuse you — you don’t use them to solve 
the problem. Two-fifths of a 40-hour workweek is 
hours per week spent
traveling.

3. (D) The distance formula is d = rt.
(1) Car headed west: d = 55 × 2.5 = 137.5
(2) Car headed east: d = 70 × 2.5 = 175
The cars were 137.5 + 175 = 312.5 miles apart. Of course, this assumes absolutely straight
roads, and no slowdowns or stops along the way, but math word problems often ask you
to make such basic assumptions.
4. (A) Using the same distance formula you used in the preceding question, you know that one
car traveled 137.5 miles and the other 175 miles. Because they were headed in the same
direction, subtract the distance traveled by the slower car from the distance traveled by
the faster car. The cars were 175 – 137.5 = 37.5 miles apart.
5. (C) The problem forms the parts of a right triangle, each car representing one leg of the
triangle (see the following figure).
It’s time to bring out your old friend, Pythagoras. I think he’s in the other room, drinking
your coffee. Go ahead and get him — I’ll wait.
The Pythagorean theorem states that if you know the length of two sides of a right triangle,
you can figure out the length of the third side with the formula a2 + b2 = c2. Plug in the known
variables:
137.52 + 1752 = c2
18,906.25 + 30,625 = c2
49,513.25 = c2
c = 222.5157
Go ahead and round this number down to 222.5.
6. (D) Add the three monthly amounts to determine the total amount Dana spent on gas:
$120.37 + $108.45 + $114.86 = $343.68. Divide the total by 3 to determine the average 
monthly cost: 
.
7. (C) To determine the amount of interest earned, multiply the principal, $3,000, by the interest
rate, 6 percent (or 0.06), and the number of years interest accrues, 1 year: $3,000 × 0.06 × 1 =
$180. Add the interest earned to the principal to find out how much total money the teacher
would have: $180 + $3,000 = $3,180.
8. (B) To find the volume of a box, the formula is v = lwd, where l = length, w = width, and 
d = depth. Plug in the known values:
v = 6 × 4 × 3
v = 72 cubic feet
The length of the legs doesn’t matter.

9. (B) 1.3 inches fell on December 1. On December 5, 0.5 inch less rain fell, or 1.3 – 0.5 = 0.8 inch.
On December 15, 3 more inches of rain fell.
Add the total inches of rain for all three days: 1.3 + 0.8 + 3 = 5.1 inches of rain.
10. (D) Determine the total area of the patio. The area formula is a = lw. Plug in the known
variables:
a = 9 × 20 = 180 square feet
You can now determine the total cost by multiplying the area of the patio, 180 square feet,
by the cost per square foot, $5.50 per square foot:
180 × $5.50 = $990
11. (D) The total of the purchase is $5 ($0.90 + $1.20 + $2.90 = $5). You know that 3.5 percent of
that amount is 5 × 0.035 = $0.175. You have to round this up to 18¢ because it’s very hard to
give half a cent in change. The total bill comes to $5 + $0.18 = $5.18. Denise should receive in
change $10 – $5.18 = $4.82.
12. (C) Determine the distance of the trip: 10 inches + 7 inches + 15 inches = 32 inches. On the
map, 1 inch = 10 miles, so 32 inches = 32 × 10 = 320 miles. This is a round trip, so remember
to double that amount: 640 miles.
Your car travels 28 miles on a gallon of gas, so you’ll need 
gallons of gas to com-
plete the trip.
Gas costs $2.73 per gallon, so you’ll need to purchase $2.73 × 22.86 = $62.41 worth of gas for
the trip.
13. (B) The time period between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. is six hours, which you can convert to 360
minutes (60 × 6 = 360). The smoke detector beeped every five minutes, so you divide the 
total number of minutes by the time-period that the smoke detector beeped: 
. Now
add 1, because it beeped at the beginning of the period: 72 + 1 = 73.
I’m not actually recommending you beat your smoke detector with a hammer. That would
be irresponsible.
14. (C) Little Tommy reads for 15 percent of the time, which means he is not reading for
100 percent – 15 percent = 85 percent of the day. And 85 percent of a 24-hour day is 
24 × 0.85 = 20.4 hours.
15. (B) Two of the walls in this room are 8 feet by 10 feet. The other two walls in this room are
8 feet by 5 feet. The ceiling is 10 feet by 5 feet. You are not painting the floor. The area for-
mula for a rectangle is a = lw. Plug in the known values:
(1) 8-x-10-foot wall: a = 8 × 10 = 80. There are two such walls, so double the area: 160
square feet.
(2) 8-x-5-foot wall: a = 8 × 5 = 40. Again, there are two of these walls, so double the area: 80
square feet
(3) 10-x-5-foot ceiling: a = 5 × 10 = 50.
Total the areas to be painted: 160 + 80 + 50 = 290 square feet. Because each can of paint will 
cover 145 square feet, you’ll need 
cans of paint for the project.
16. (C) Mentally construct the box. Once completed, the box will be 4 feet long (8 – 4 = 4), by
2 feet wide (6 – 4 = 2), by 2 feet deep (the length of the cuts). The volume formula for a
rectangle is v = lwd. Plug in the known values:
v = 4 × 2 × 2
v = 16 cubic feet

17. (B) There are 12 bunches of bananas in a stack, which means there are 72 bunches of 
bananas in 6 dozen (6 × 12 = 72). One-quarter of 72 is 
.
18. (A) The salesperson sold $45,000 + $30,000 = $75,000 worth of cars during the week. She
earned a 20 percent commission, or $75,000 × 0.20 = $15,000.
Fifteen percent of her commission, or $15,000 × 0.15 = $2,250 is withheld for deductions. The
salesperson’s paycheck should be $15,000 – $2,250 = $12,750.
Hmm. . . . Maybe I should become a used-car salesman. Anybody want to buy a nice Chevy?
19. (C) Each section of pipe is (6 feet × 12 inches) + 3 inches = 72 + 3 = 75 inches long. The
plumber needs four sections, so he needs 300 inches of pipe. The plumber will have to 
purchase 
feet of pipe.
The plumber needs 25 feet of pipe, and pipe is sold for $4.25 per foot. This means the
plumber must pay 25 × $42.25 = $106.25 for the pipe he needs.
20. (D) First, convert the ratio to a set of fractions. The ratio 5:3 can be converted to a fraction
by adding the two sides of the ratio together to determine the denominator, while retaining 
the first side of the ratio as the numerator of the fraction: 5 + 3 = 8, so Rod contributed 
of 
the money, meaning Joy contributed 
.
Three-eighths of $200,000 is 
.
21. (B) From solving the preceding problem, you know that Joy’s share of the sale is $75,000.
That means Rod’s share is $200,000 – $75,000 = $125,000. Because Rod still owes $100,000 to
the bank, he only gets to keep $125,000 – $100,000 = $25,000.
22. (C) Use the distance formula, d = rt, which can be restated as 
. Substitute the known
values:
Original trip: 
hours
Return trip: 
hours
Add the time required for the original trip and the return trip and the sum is 5 + 5.83 =
10.83 hours.
The time for the complete trip is 10.83 hours, which can be rounded down to 10.8 hours.
23. (B) This is an example of a problem where the answer should be obvious after just a quick
glance. Since C = 0, you know that F = 32.
24. (B) Let x = the full price. You know that $4.20 has been discounted 25 percent from the full
price. Therefore,
$4.20 = 0.75x
25. (C) There are 365 days per year (you have to assume this isn’t a leap year). To find the aver-
age number of daily hits, divide the total number of hits for the year, by the total number of 
days in a year: 
.
26. (D) The weight of the water is the weight of the full barrel minus the weight of the empty
barrel: 455 – 35 = 420. Divide the weight of the water, 420, by the number of gallons, 50: 
.

27. (C) Let q = the number of quarters. That means the number of nickels = q + 11.
Each quarter is worth 25 percent of a dollar, each dime is worth 5 percent of a dollar, and the
total amount of change is $2.65. You now have enough information to set up the equation:
0.25q + 0.05(q + 11) = 2.65
0.3q + 0.55 = 2.65
q = 7
28. (B) Dale worked a total of 52 hours during the week (8 + 9 + 12 + 11 + 12 = 52). Forty of those
hours were for regular pay and 52 – 40 = 12 hours were for overtime pay.
Dale earns $12.50 per hour for regular pay and $12.50 × 1.5 = $18.75 for overtime pay.
Dale earned 40 × $12.50 = $500 for his regular hours and 18.75 × 12 = $225 in overtime pay.
Dale earned $500 + $225 = $725 total during the week.
29. (A) You know that a decade is ten years. So, multiply the number of years by the total
french fries eaten in a year: 6.7 × 10 = 67.
30. (C) The rate formula is d = rt, so you can use this formula to solve the problem. However, in
the problem, the rate is expressed in miles per hour and the distance is expressed in min-
utes. In math, as in other areas of life, you can’t compare applies to oranges. Either you
have to convert the miles per hour to miles per minute or you have to convert the minutes
to a fraction of the hour.
45 minutes = 
hours
You can now use the rate formula. Plug in the known variables:
d = 0.75 × 50
d = 37.5
Part 2: Word Knowledge
The Word Knowledge subtest is nothing more than a vocabulary test. However, it can be
hard for some people. The good news is that vocabulary isn’t an innate talent. It’s something
that everyone can improve. If you find you need to improve your vocabulary, see Chapter 4.
A couple of other great study references are Vocabulary For Dummies by Laurie E. Rozakis
(Wiley) and SAT Vocabulary For Dummies by Suzee Vlk (Wiley). Additionally, see Chapter 5
for more practice questions.

Part 3: Paragraph Comprehension
The Paragraph Comprehension subtest can be a bit tricky, but you need to get a good score
on this subtest if you want to ace the AFQT. So pay special attention if you’ve missed more
than a couple of these answers — you need some study time (see Chapter 6). Remember that
rereading the paragraph several times to make sure that you have the right answer is per-
fectly fine. The best method of improving your reading comprehension skills is simply to
read more. You can find additional practice questions in Chapter 7.

Part IV: AFQT Practice Exams 

1. (D) The passage makes it obvious that the author believes Patrick’s excuse is believable,
even though he still has doubts.
2. (C) This is explained in the very first sentence of the paragraph.
3. (B) The AFAS does not provide home loans, nor does anything in the paragraph indicate
that it does.
4. (B) The third sentence of the passage states that the mission of the AFAS can be traced back
to the original Army Air Corps and World War II Army Air Forces.
5. (B) The passage says that the U.S. shares a border with Canada to the north and Mexico to
the south.
6. (A) The passage says there are 50 states in all, and 48 of them form the contiguous United
States. Therefore, two states are separate. (The two states are Alaska and Hawaii, in case
you didn’t know.)
7. (C) This is presented in the sixthsentence of the paragraph. Although American nationals
have the same legal protections that citizens have, they don’t have the same full political
rights.
8. (A) The author is saying that even if we want war to be bloodless and free of violence, the
dangers and risks of war will stay the same.
9. (B) The main point of the paragraph is that you must work, study, observe, read, and pre-
pare in order to become successful as a leader.
10. (D) The author gives two reasons for his dad’s purchasing a stable: the nicest one in town
was for sale, and he was always crazy about horses. The fact that he had just sold his busi-
ness isn’t a factor, because he had already intended to invest in an orange grove at the time
he sold the business.
11. (B) The good doctor piled every word he had ever written into large confusing piles. (I think
maybe I’m related to him.)
12. (B) The last sentence of the paragraph states that he “patiently rummaged” through the
papers.

14. (D) The paragraph lists all these consequences of the absence of time management.
15. (D) The last sentence states that time management must be planned.
Part 4: Mathematics Knowledge
Some folks find math to be a breeze and can’t understand why the rest of us approach math
problems with all the enthusiasm of a trip to the dentist. However, the military considers
math skills to be important, and they’re right. If you miss more than four or five questions,
you should consider brushing up on your basic math skills — Chapter 8 can help with this.
As with the Arithmetic Reasoning subtest, the following For Dummies books may also be of
some help: Algebra I For Dummies and Algebra II For Dummies, both by Mary Jane Sterling;
Geometry For Dummies, 2nd Edition, and Calculus For Dummies, both by Mark Ryan; and
SAT II Math For Dummies, by Scott Hatch, JD, and Lisa Zimmer Hatch, MA (all published by
Wiley). Chapter 9 also has some additional practice questions.
1. (C) To compare fractions with different denominators, take the cross-product. The first cross-
product is the product of the first numerator and the second denominator. The second
cross-product is the product of the second numerator and the first denominator. If the cross-
products are equal, the fractions are equivalent. If the first cross-product is larger, the first
fraction is larger. If the second cross-product is larger, the second fraction is larger.
209
Chapter 15: Practice Exam 2: Answers and Explanations

Compare the first two fractions, 
and 
: 13 × 5 = 65 and 20 × 3 = 60. The second 
fraction, , is larger.
Compare the larger fraction, , to the next fraction, 
: 3 × 16 = 48 
and 5 × 13 = 65. 
is the larger fraction.
Compare this fraction, 
, with D, 
: 13 × 4 = 52 and 16 × 3 = 48. 
is the largest fraction.
2. (D) Surprised to see such an easy question? On the Mathematics Knowledge subtest of the
ASVAB, you’ll see a few very simple questions. Don’t get suspicious and think it might be a
trap! Sometimes obvious really is obvious.
3. (D) 
4. (B) The figure shown is a trapezoid, which is a quadrilateral — it has four sides. All quadri-
laterals have angles that total 360 degrees.
5. (B) The shape is actually a square, measuring 1 inch by 1 inch, and a rectangle measuring
7 inches by 10 inches (see the following figure).
The formula used to find the area of a square or rectangle is a = lw. Substitute the known
values:
Square: a = 1 × 1 = 1
Rectangle: a = 7 × 10 = 70
Add the area of the square and the area of the rectangle: 70 + 1 = 71.
6. (A) No tricks. The square root of a number squared is the number itself.
Sometimes the obvious answer is the right answer.
7 inches
1 inch
1 inch
10 inches

Part IV: AFQT Practice Exams 

7. (C) To change an improper fraction into a mixed number, divide the numerator by the denomi-
nator. The remainder is the numerator of the fractional part: 11 ÷ 4 = 2 with a remainder of 3. 
Therefore, 
8. (C) Move the decimal point, so that there is only one digit to the left. Count as you move
(11 places). Because you moved the decimal point to the left, the powers of 10 are positive.
9. (D) The x and y lines intersect at the points of 4 and –2. When plotting, always give the
x (horizontal) coordinate first.
10. (B) If you have an arithmetic sequence of N numbers and you know the first and last one, 
you can find the sum by: 
, where N = the total number of numbers (in this case, 
300), f = the first number in the sequence (in this case, 1), and l = the last number in the
sequence (here, 300). Plug in the known variables:
s = 45,150
11. (B) The easiest way to determine number sequences is to factor the numbers and look for
relationships among the factors:
1 = no factors
8 = 2 × 2 × 2
27 = 3 × 3 × 3
64 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 or 4 × 4 × 4
125 = 5 × 5 × 5
See the pattern? It’s 13, 23, 33, 43, 53.
The next number in the sequence would obviously be 63, or 6 × 6 × 6 = 216.
12. (A) Add the numbers and then divide by the number of terms: 53 + 27 + 32 + 41 = 153 and 
.
13. (D) Convert the yards to feet by multiplying by 3: 8 × 3 = 24. Now simply add the feet together: 
24 + 15 = 39 feet. You can convert the feet to yards, by dividing by 3: 
yards (but that’s
not one of the answer choices given).
14. (B) The arithmetic mean of a series of numbers is the same as the average of a series of num-
bers. To find the average, add the numbers, then divide by the number of terms: 4 + 9 = 13.
Divided by 2, the answer is 6.5. 
15. (B) If two numbers have the same base, they can be multiplied by keeping the base and
adding the powers together.
16. (D) Arithmetic mean simply means the average. So, 15 + 5 = 30. Divide the sum by 2 and the
result is 15.

Chapter 15: Practice Exam 2: Answers and Explanations

17. (D) A polygon is a closed figure made by joining line segments, where each line segment
intersects exactly two others. A pentagon is a five-sided polygon.
18. (D) Convert to the lowest common denominator (which is 10), then add:
19. (C) Combine the like terms, then simplify:
(4x – 2x2 – 7xy) + (2x2 + 5xy) =
–2x2 + 2x2 – 7xy + 5xy + 4x =
–2xy + 4x =
4x – 2xy
20. (D) This problem can be rather confusing if you try directly to solve for x. Instead, think of
the term (x + 3) as its own entity. In fact, let y = (x + 3), and substitute it for (x + 3) in the
equation:
(x + 3)3 + 2(x + 3)2 – 8(x + 3)2 = 0
y3 + 2y2 – 8y2 = 0
y3 – 6y2 = 0
y2(y – 6) = 0
At this point, it should be obvious that y = 0. Since y = 0, and y also equals (x + 3), you could
say that x + 3 = 0. Therefore, x = –3. But y = 6, too. Replacing the y with 6 in y = x + 3, you get
that 6 = x + 3 or x = 3. So x = ±3. 
21. (C) Combine like terms and simplify:
a2x – bx – a2y + by + a2z – bz =
a2x – a2y + a2z – bz + by – bz =
a2(x – y + z) – b(x – y + z) =
(a2 – b)(x – y + z)
22. (D) The area of a square can be determined by the formula a = lw. Because all sides of a
square are equal, this can also be stated as a = s2, where s is the length of each side. Plug in
the known values:
225 = s2
±
s = ±15
You can discard –15, because it isn’t logical in this problem.
23. (A) The ≤symbol means “less than or equal to.”
24. (B) Scientific notation is converted to a regular number by moving the decimal point either
to the right or left, depending on whether the exponent of 10 is positive or negative. In this
case, the exponent is negative, so you move the decimal five places to the left.
25. (B) 
. So, 0.93 × 75 = 69.75.

B
y now you have two practice AFQT tests under your belt, and I hope you’re feeling a
bit more confident. If not, don’t worry. There are two practice tests left to go. In the
sections that follow, you’ll find the four subtests of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude
Battery (ASVAB), which make up the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) score:
Arithmetic Reasoning, Word Knowledge, Paragraph Comprehension, and Mathematics
Knowledge.
You’ll recall from Chapter 2 that the military services use the scores derived from these
four subtests to determine your overall AFQT score, and that the AFQT score is the primary
factor which decides whether or not you are qualified to enlist in the military branch of your
choice. Remember to use the results of the below practice exam to decide which areas you
should dedicate
Use the answer key and explanations in Chapter 17 to score your practice exam. Remember
not to be too concerned with how many you get right and how many you get wrong. Some
of the questions on the practice exam are hard, and others are very easy. When you take the
actual subtests as part of the ASVAB, harder questions are awarded more points than easier
questions. See Chapter 2 to see exactly how this works, and how it affects your overall AFQT
score.
Take this practice exam about a week before you’re scheduled to take the actual ASVAB. Use
the results to determine which AFQT subjects need a little extra attention.

In the eyes of his classmates, Sam Smith was
a nerd, but in the eyes of the faculty, he was a
stellar scholar and proof that Jefferson High was
a citadel of superior education. Sam’s intellectual
image was enhanced by his wavy, overgrown hair,
thick glasses, and sharp tongue. What no one
realized, though, was that Sam was a budding
entrepreneur and an excellent potential
fundraiser for the senior class trip. The senior
class found out about the fundraiser during his-
tory class. Sam was in his usual front-row seat,
sitting alert and straight as if good posture could
further polish his perfect 4.0 average. Mr. Date
told his class about getting orders for Christmas
wreaths by going door to door, and then he
handed out glossy brochures. Sam had great
determination to make the most of this
fundraiser because the senior who sold the most
wreaths earned a free movie pass for a month!
After class, Sam stopped by the library to tell
Miss Dewey, the school librarian, all about their
fundraising project. The lonesome, steely-eyed
book organizer and the brilliant, solitary student
huddled together over a notepad like two ancient
alchemists hovering over a bubbling pot creating
potions. Miss Dewey was surprisingly shrewd.
She did all the calculations for library fines as
well as the renewal dates for books in her head.

Water pollution is a major national concern
and a high priority in environmental programs.
The introduction of pollutants to our rivers,
streams, lakes, and watersheds has caused many
previous sources of fresh water to become con-
taminated. Major water pollutants include
untreated wastewater, storm-water runoff from
industrial activities, and pollutants from nonpoint
sources like airfield and agricultural runoff. Water
pollution can result from any chemical used on,
disposed of, or leaked onto the ground. Many
underground storage tanks have leaked and
contaminated the groundwater. Overuse of

Inspector General (IG) teams evaluate a mili-
tary unit’s management of nuclear resources
against approved safety, security, and reliability
standards. Teams evaluate logistics airlift units
with nuclear weapons transport missions by
observing loading, transporting, unloading, and
custody transferring procedures of representa-
tive types of weapons. The unit’s proficiency is
determined by using war reserve (WR) weapons
when possible. Training weapons or weapon
system simulations are used when WR assets are
not available. The final rating is based on the
nature, severity, and number of findings noted
during the inspection. The unit will be assigned a
rating of Satisfactory; Satisfactory (Support
Unsatisfactory), for deficiencies outside the con-
trol of the commander; or Unsatisfactory. If a unit
receives an overall Unsatisfactory, the unit will be
reinspected within 90 days.

Sports and recreational activities provide an
opportunity for escape from the daily routine. By
nature, some sports and recreational activities
have hazards that cannot be eliminated. Officials,
coaches, and athletes should become familiar
with the injury potentials of recreational activi-
ties and learn how to avoid them. Each person
who participates in sports or recreational activi-
ties must exercise good judgment. A complete,
progressive warm-up and stretching program is
essential before engaging in sports or vigorous
recreational activities. Many injuries occur
because people are out of shape or have not
warmed up properly. Injury prevention is prima-
rily a participant’s responsibility. Peer pressure is
often the cause of sports and recreational
injuries. A good rule to know and follow is to rec-
ognize and respect individual limitations.

What is the main focus of the above 
paragraph?
(A) getting in shape
(B) escaping from life’s problems
(C) the importance of warming up properly

Katie took one more look at her homework
through tired, bleary eyes. The report was due
next week, and she hadn’t started on it yet. She
blew back her overgrown bangs that fell across
her face and wondered what to do next. She had
already cleaned the house and took some chicken
out of the freezer to thaw for dinner. Nothing she
did that day, however, gave her inspiration for her
report. She thought about asking her friend Rod
for help, but he was out of town. Katie was proud
of her high GPA and was worried about this proj-
ect, lest she should be taken off the dean’s list.
Her cellphone rang, giving her an excuse to ignore
Reaganomics for a few more minutes. She reached
for her phone like a hungry kid who had just seen
a piece of candy. In the process, she almost
scared her pet cat, Whiskers to death. She took a
second to soothe Whiskers (who lost most of his
whiskers in a catfight), but the task proved to be
impossible. The call was from her friend, Autumn.

I know you’re now interested, so I’ll continue
the story:
Autumn had long, blond hair that perfectly
matched her somewhat frazzled and dizzy person-
ality. Katie, on the other hand, had a halcyon tem-
perament. Katie secretly wondered if all those
blond curls affected Autumn’s brain. Autumn bub-
bled on about her boyfriend and then dropped a
bomb that changed Katie’s day. Katie’s friend Rod
was planning a cruise next month, and he asked
Autumn if she wanted to go! Autumn’s melodious
voice was triumphant. The only smooth thing
about Autumn was her euphonious voice. Katie
felt a whole gamut of emotions about Autumn’s
surprise. She felt jealous because she wanted to go
on a cruise, too, but she also felt excited because
the entire cruise situation gave her an idea for her
report. She quickly made excuses and hung up.
She was usually garrulous, but she wanted to start
her project right away. She couldn’t bear to hear
Autumn’s drivel about cruise minutiae. She knew it
was petty, but she couldn’t bear to hear Autumn’s
chatter for one more second.

“The difference in affection, of parents
towards their several children, is many times
unequal; and sometimes unworthy; especially
in the mothers; as Solomon saith, A wise son
rejoiceth the father, but an ungracious son
shames the mother. A man shall see, where there
is a house full of children, one or two of the eldest
respected, and the youngest made wantons; but
in the midst, some that are as it were forgotten,
who many times, nevertheless, prove the best.
The illiberality of parents, in allowance toward
their children, is an harmful error; makes them
base; acquaints them with shifts; makes them sort
with mean company; and makes them surfeit
more when they come to plenty.”

Chapter 17
Practice Exam 3: Answers and
Explanations
A
re you getting tired of math and English yet? I certainly hope not. You still have one full-
length AFQT practice test to go. Then, if you still want more practice, I recommend you
jog on down to your neighborhood bookstore and pick up a copy of ASVAB For Dummies,
written by yours truly (published by Wiley).
Use the answer keys in the following sections to find out how you did on the AFQT practice
exam in Chapter 16. The accompanying explanations will tell you how to get to the correct
answer if you got somewhat lost along the way.
Part 1: Arithmetic Reasoning
If you already took three practice AFQT exams, and the temperature is a steady 87 degrees,
what is the probability that you got most of the questions right on all four subtests? Okay,
that’s not a real arithmetic reasoning question (insufficient data, as my computer friends
say), but I’m betting you’ve done pretty well. Now it’s time to see how you did on this
Arithmetic Reasoning practice subtest.
If you need more practice doing arithmetic reasoning–type problems, Chapters 8 and 10 are a
good place to start. You can also check out Math Word Problems For Dummies, Algebra I For
Dummies, and Algebra II For Dummies, all by Mary Jane Sterling; Geometry For Dummies,
2nd Edition, and Calculus For Dummies, both by Mark Ryan; and SAT II Math For Dummies,
by Scott Hatch, JD, and Lisa Zimmer Hatch, MA — all published by Wiley.
1. (A) You can set up this problem as a ratio: $422 is to 30 hours as $455 is to x hours.
Mathematically, this is stated as
14.07x = 455
x = 32.33 hours

2. (C) The circumference (length around) a circle can be determined by the formula, c = πd. The
diameter of a circle is twice its radius, so this circle has a diameter of 100 yards. Plug in the
known values:
c = 100π
c = 100 × 3.14
c = 314 yards
3. (C) The time between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. is 4 hours, or 60 × 4 = 240 minutes. Divide the total
number of minutes in the time period by 15 minutes, the interval in which the camera takes
the pictures. Then add 1 because the first picture is taken at the beginning of the period: 
.
4. (B) In order to maintain her current weight, Joy’s body needs 7 × 2,000 =14,000 calories
during the week. Joy is taking in 7 × 1,500 = 10,500 calories per week in food, and is burning
up 7 × 400 = 2,800 calories per week while exercising.
That means Joy is taking in a total of 10,500 – 2,800 = 7,700 calories per week. Subtract her
total calorie intake from the number of calories in a week that her body needs to maintain
her weight, and you have a deficit of 14,000 – 7,700 = 6,300 calories.
Since a deficit of 2,500 calories equals 1 pound of weight loss, divide the calorie deficit by
the number of calorie deficit needed for 1 pound of weight loss: 6,300 ÷ 2,500 = 2.52). Joy 
will have lost about 
pounds.
5. (B) Subtract the first day’s breakfast charge from the total: $8.25 – $2 = $6.25. Then divide
the remainder by $1.25 to determine the number of additional consecutive days the 
customer ate breakfast: 
. Add those five days to the first day the special was eaten 
to find out that the customer ate the breakfast special for six consecutive days.
6. (D) Divide the group of 40 soldiers by the number of basic trainees who can be trained at the
same time: 40 ÷ 10 = 4. This means that four groups of soldiers have to share the 60 minutes,
or 60 minutes ÷ 4 = 15 minutes. Thus, each soldier gets 15 minutes of training time.
7. (A) This problem can be expressed as a ratio: 9 candles is to 1 hour as 126 candles is to
x hours. Mathematically, this can be written
9x = 126
x = 14
8. (A) The formula to determine the area of a rectangle is a = lw. Find the area of each bed-
room and add them together:
12 × 14 = 168
12 × 10 = 120
8 × 12 = 96
168 + 120 + 96 = 384 square feet
Then, because 3 feet make up a yard, there are 9 square feet to a square yard. Divide the 
total area in square feet by 9 to determine the number of square yards needed: 
square yards. Multiply this by the cost per square yard of carpet: $4.25 × 42.66 = $181.33.

9. (D) First, convert the 15 percent to a decimal by dividing it by 100: 
. The probability
that all five CD players will be defective is 0.15 × 0.15 × 0.15 × 0.15 × 0.15 = 0.0000759 (round
up to 0.000076). Now convert this back to a percentage by multiplying it by 100: 0.000076 ×
100 = 0.0076.
10. (C) This is an easy one. (Don’t look so surprised — you’ll see a few easy ones on the AFQT.)
Simply subtract the weight of the books from the total weight of the box with books: 
60 – 53 = 7.
11. (B) Divide $30 by $3.95. The whole number is the number of pairs of socks he could buy: 
, or 7 pairs of socks. (Don’t round up to 8, because he can’t afford eight pairs.)
12. (D) Add the sales amounts together: $25.70 + $32.30 + $31.80 = $89.80. Then multiply the
total sales by 0.75 to determine how much money she has left: $89.80 × 0.75 = $67.35.
13. (B) Calculate each answer option and compare:
A: 2 × $0.79 = $1.58.
B: $1.49.
C: Two 3-ounce cans don’t equal 8 ounces, so this answer can’t be correct.
D: 3 × $0.65 = $1.95.
B is the cheapest option.
14. (B) The first bike got a 
-mile head start. Therefore, by the time the second bike 
leaves, there are 
miles between them. Their combined rate of travel is 12 + 14 = 
26 mph. Let t = the number of hours the second bike travels.
of an hour = 12 minutes. The second bike left at 2:09, so both bikes will meet at 2:21.
15. (A) First, find how many screws a full bin contains: 7 × 12 = 84 screws. Then multiply the 
total number of screws in a full bin by 
to find how many screws are in the bin when it’s 
full: 
screws.
16. (C) Divide $130 by $900 to determine the percentage of $900 that the reward comprised:
$130 ÷ $900 = 0.14 = 14.4 percent.
17. (C) A square has four equal sides. Divide the total length of the rope by 4 to find out how
long each side of the square will be: 12 ÷ 4 = 3.
18. (C) The total number of races is 18: 4 + 6 + 8 = 18. If she placed first in four of her races, the 
fraction would be expressed as 
, which can be reduced to .
19. (B) The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is p = 2l + 2w. In this case, p = 147, w is
unknown, and l = 3w. Plug in the known values:
241
Chapter 17: Practice Exam 3: Answers and Explanations

147 = 2(3w) + 2w
147 = 6w + 2w
147 = 8w
w = 18.375
The width of the rectangle is 18.375 inches. Because the length is 3 times the width, 3 × 21 =
55.125. Round this down to 55.1.
20. (A) Take a look at the following figure. As you can see, the measurements of the chain-link
enclosure will be 25 feet by 28 feet.
The perimeter formula for a rectangle is p = 2l + 2w. Plug in the known values:
P = (2 × 25) + (2 × 28)
P = 50 + 56
P = 106
Lyle will need 106 feet of fence.
21. (A) The area of the entire piece of canvas is 10 inches × 14 inches = 140 square inches.
The portion painted is 8 inches × 12 inches = 96 square inches. (You determine this by sub-
tracting 1 inch from the length of each side to account for the margin.) The portion used 
for painting can be expressed as a fraction: 
. Reduce this fraction (divide 96 by 140) to 
determine that 68.5 percent of the canvas is covered with paint.
22. (B) If 2 inches = 3 miles, then 1 inch equals 
miles. Multiply 
inches to determine the
actual distance: 1.5 × 9.5 = 14.25, or 
miles.

23. (C) The formula to determine the diagonal of a rectangle is d2 = l2 + w2. Plug in the known
values:
d2 = 1002 + 752
d2 = 10,000 + 5,625
d2 = 15,625
d = 125 yards
24. (B) Multiply his total sales by his percent commission to find his commission: $8,434.80 ×
0.35 = $2,952.18.
25. (B) The fastest way to solve this would be to simply add the numbers in the possible
answer choices: 55 + 57 + 59 = 171.
However, you can also find the answer by using algebra. Let x = the first number. That
means the second number is x + 2, and the third number is x + 4. The sum of these three
numbers is 171. The formula becomes:
x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 171
3x + 7 = 171
3x = 165
x = 55
The first number is 55. That means the second number is x + 2 = 55 + 2 = 57, and the third
number is x + 4 = 55 + 4 = 59.
26. (D) There are 10 packs of cigarettes in each carton, and a carton costs $35.80. That means 
each pack of cigarettes costs $35.80 ÷ 10 = $3.58. Rod smokes 
packs of cigarettes each 
day. It costs Rod 1.5 × $3.58 = $5.37 per day to support his habit.
Don’t be like Rod. If you smoke, quit. Besides, they won’t let you smoke in basic training
anyway.
27. (B) Let x equal the number of daily tickets you would purchase. Then 27x = the daily
ticket cost.
175 < 27x
6.48 < x
You would need to use the ticket more than 6.48 times (or 7 times) in order for it to be
cheaper to use the season ticket.
28. (B) Two people is 
as many as eight people: 
. Multiply the number of machines 
that eight people can run by 
to determine how many machines two people can run: 
.

29. (C) Let x equal Jeanie’s hourly wage. Then x + 2 would represent Bob’s hourly wage, and 
3(x + 2) would represent Sam’s hourly wage.
x + (x + 2) + 3(x + 2) = 55
x + x + 2 + 3x + 6 = 55
5x + 8 = 55
5x = 47
x = 9.4
Jeanie’s hourly wage is $9.40.
30. (D) The formula to determine the area of a rectangle is a = lw. Plug in the known values:
a = 10 × 16
a = 160 square feet
Multiply this number by the cost per square foot to determine what the brick layer charges:
160 × $12 = $1,920.
Part 2: Word Knowledge
Scoring well on the Word Knowledge subtest is crucial to scoring high on the AFQT and get-
ting into the military branch of your choice. If your score is weak in this area, spend time
reviewing the material and improving your vocabulary (see Chapter 4).
Other great references that can help you improve your score in this area are Vocabulary For
Dummies, by Laurie E. Rozakis, and SAT Vocabulary For Dummies, by Suzee Vlk (both pub-
lished by Wiley). Plus, see Chapter 5 for more practice questions.

Part 3: Paragraph Comprehension
Those ASVAB folks sure don’t give you much time to read all those paragraphs, do they? But,
with a little practice, anyone can improve his reading speed and comprehension skills. The
material in Chapter 6 can be helpful in these endeavors. There are also more practice ques-
tions in Chapter 7.
1. (A) In the fourth sentence, the author describes Sam’s 4.0 grade-point average. A 4.0 GPA is
a perfect grade-point average.
2. (A) The entire senior class found out about the fundraiser in history class. That’s the setting
for the story’s beginning.
3. (B) The last sentence describes Miss Dewey as shrewd. “Miss” implies that she is not married.

245
Chapter 17: Practice Exam 3: Answers and Explanations

5. (D) The paragraph states, “the growing population, expanding industry, and increasing agri-
cultural production have created an increasing demand for fresh water.” Although B and C
may be true, in general, the topics are not mentioned in the passage.
6. (A) The primary purpose of the inspection discussed is to ensure the proper management

9. (D) The third sentence in the paragraph lists those who should learn how to avoid such
injuries.
10. (B) As Katie’s report was about “Reaganomics,” the most likely choice is economics.
11. (C) The author makes it obvious that Katie wants to keep her GPA up and is worried about
this report. She considers calling her friend Rod for help, which indicates that Katie must
think he’s pretty smart about her homework topic.
12. (B) The author states that Katie’s “halcyon” personality was in contrast to Autumn’s
“frazzled and dizzy” personality. The answer choice that is the best antonym for frazzled
and dizzy is calm.
13. (D) Katie was jealous because she wanted to go on a cruise, but she was excited because it
gave her an idea for her report.
14. (B) In the second sentence, the author states that in a house full of children one or two of

often forgotten.
15. (A) The author’s belief that the mother’s affections are most unequal is stated in the first
sentence.
Part 4: Mathematics Knowledge
Many people find the mathematics knowledge subtest to be more difficult than the Arithmetic
Reasoning subtest, but doing well on this subtest is just as important. If you missed more than
a few answers, or you ran out of time before you finished, you have a date with the books
(Chapter 8 is a great place to start). Getting in touch with a math teacher at your high school
or a local community college (or at least finding a good basic-algebra textbook) can help.
You can also try out the following Dummies books: Algebra I For Dummies and Algebra II For
Dummies, both by Mary Jane Sterling; Geometry For Dummies, by Wendy Arnone; Calculus
For Dummies, by Mark Ryan; and SAT II Math For Dummies, by Scott Hatch (all published by
Wiley). Chapter 9 also has some additional practice questions.
1. (B) 33 + (–2)2 = (3 × 3 × 3) + (–2 × –2) = 27 + 4 = 31. Multiplying two negative numbers results
in a positive number.
2. (B) 5! means the factorial of five. It’s equivalent to 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.
3. (C) The formula to find out the volume of a cylinder is πr2h. Plug in the known variables:
3.14 × 42 × 6 = 3.14 × 16 × 6 = 50.24 × 6 = 301.44. Round down to 301.4.
4. (D) The whole-number part of a logarithm is called the characteristic. This part of the loga-
rithm shows the position of the decimal point in the associated number. (The decimal part
of a logarithm is called the mantissa, just in case you were wondering.)
246
Part IV: AFQT Practice Exams 

5. (B) 
x = 4 × 19
x = 76
6. (C) The sum of the angles for any polygon can be determined by the formula s = (n – 2) × 180,
where s = the sum of angles and n = the number of sides. A hexagon has six sides. Plug in the
known values:
s = (6 – 2) × 180
s = 4 × 180
s = 720
7. (A) Plug the known values into the formula, d2 = l2 + w2:
52 = (w + 1)2 + w2
25 = (w + 1)(w + 1) + w2
25 = w2 + 2w + 1 + w2
25 = 2w2 + 2w + 1
0 = 2w2 + 2w + 1 – 25
0 = 2w2 + 2w – 24
0 = w2 + w – 12
This is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:
0 = (w – 3)(w + 4)
w – 3 = 0 and w + 4 = 0
w = 3 and w = –4
You can’t have a rectangle with a width of –4, so 3 is the only possible answer.
8. (B) Remember that brilliant Greek mathematician, Pythagoras, from Chapter 8? He said that
if you know the length of any two sides of a triangle, you can find the length of the third side
by applying the Pythagorean theorem, a2 + b2 = c2. Plug in the known values:
52 + 62 = c2
25 + 36 = c2
61 = c2
c = 7.81
Round down do 7.8.
9. (B)
247
Chapter 17: Practice Exam 3: Answers and Explanations

10. (B) The problem is asking you to subtract 
percent of the value of x from the value of x: 
x – 0.3175x = 174.4
x (1 – 0.3175) = 174.4
0.6825x = 174.4
x = 255.53
Round this up to 255.5
11. (D) A negative exponent just means that the base is on the wrong side of the fraction line, so 
you need to flip the base to the other side. For example, 
.
12. (A) n = 2 because 32 = 9. Now that you know the value of n, simply plug it into the equation,
4x – n = 6:
4x – 2 = 6
4x = 8
x = 2
13. (B) 5x + 7 = 6(x – 2) – 4(2x – 3)
5x + 7 = 6x – 12 – 8x + 12
5x + 7 = –2x
7x + 7 = 0
7x = –7
x = –1
14. (D)
15. (D) To convert scientific notation to regulation notation, move the decimal place to the left
(for a negative exponent), the same number of spaces as the exponent (in this case, 4).
16. (A) 10,000 = 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 = 104.
17. (C) The area of a rectangle can be determined by using the formula, a = lw. Plug in the
known values:
a = 6 × 8
a = 48
18. (B) (–3)3 = –3 × –3 × –3 = –27. If the exponent (power) of a negative number base is odd,
the result will be a negative number. If the exponent of a negative number base is even, the
result will be a positive number.
248
Part IV: AFQT Practice Exams 

19. (A) You have to figure the area of two shapes: a half-circle and a triangle. The formula to 
determine the area of a triangle is 
, where b = the base of the triangle and h = the 
height of the triangle. The radius of the half-circle is 3 feet, which means the base of the tri-
angle is 6 feet (twice the radius of the circle). Plug in the known values:
A = 12
The area of the triangle is 12 square feet.
The formula to determine the area of a circle is A = πr2, where r = the radius of the circle. But 
you only want the radius of one-half of the circle, so the formula becomes 
. Plug in
the known values:
A = 14.13 feet
The area of the half-circle is 14.13 square feet. Add the two areas together: 14.13 + 12 =
26.13. Round this down to 26.1 square feet.
20. (B) 
21. (B) –7(4x + 5) – 8 = –7(4x) – (7 × 5) – 8 = –28x – 35 – 8 = –28x – 43.
22. (C) You have to compute the areas of two shapes: a square and a circle. The area of the
shaded portion is the area of the square minus the area of the circle.
The formula to determine the area of a square is A = s2, where s = the length of one side of
the square. Plug in the known value:
A = 42
A = 4 × 4 = 16
The area of the square is 16 square feet.
To determine the area of the circle, use the formula, A = πr2. Plug in the known values:
A = 3.14 × 1
A = 3.14
Subtract the area of the circle from the area of the square: 16 – 3.14 = 12.86. Round this up to
12.9 square feet.
23. (D) The diameter of a circle is twice its radius. This circle has a radius of 2 inches, so its
diameter is 4 inches.
24. (C) To determine the circumference of a circle, use the formula, c = πd. Plug in the known
values: c = 3.14 × 4 = 12.56. Round this up to 12.6 inches.
25. (A) If 4x is greater than 7, that means 7 is less than 4x.

ongratulations! You made it to the final AFQT practice exam. By now you should be
ready to tackle the actual Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) and
impress all those military recruiters when you ace the four subtests that make up the AFQT.
If you still want some more practice after this exam, or you want to study for the other
ASVAB subtests as well, might I humbly suggest ASVAB For Dummies (Wiley)?
The four sections that follow represent the four subtests of the ASVAB that make up your all-
important AFQT score. This is the score that determines whether you’re qualified to join the
military branch of your choice (see Chapter 2). The four subtests are: Arithmetic Reasoning,
Word Knowledge, Paragraph Comprehension, and Mathematics Knowledge.
Use the answer key and explanations in Chapter 19 to score the following sections. Remember:
On the actual ASVAB, harder questions are worth more points than easier questions when you
determine your AFQT score.
Take the final practice exam a day or two before the ASVAB to make sure you’re ready, and to
boost your confidence. If you don’t score well, you may wish want to consider asking your
recruiter to reschedule your ASVAB test for a later date, to give you more time to study.
Ready to get started? Okay, hold your No. 2 pencil in the air. (Not really — your friends might
start talking about you). Ready, set, go!

Trust is essential in forming any good rela-
tionship. Teamwork requires good relationships
with a high degree of trust. Team members must
share mutual confidence in the integrity and abil-
ity of teammates. They also need to feel comfort-
able enough to take risks, think outside the box,
and share their thoughts and ideas without fear
of being shut down or discounted. Freedom to
communicate openly, honestly, and directly with
people within the group is the hallmark of a team
that has trust. Dr. Suzanne Zoglio, an organiza-
tional consultant and founder of the Institute for
Planning and Development, states in her book
entitled Teams at Work, “Nothing reduces trust in
a group faster than members saying one thing
within the group and something else outside the
group. When members are assertive enough to
say what they need to say directly to the appro-
priate people and to refrain from talking behind
each other’s backs, trust is enhanced.”
1.
According to Dr. Zoglio, the fastest way to
destroy trust in a group is to:
(A) try to control the group
(B) steal from your co-workers
(C) talk behind other people’s backs
(D) complain about others to the boss
The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) pro-
vides access to federal agency records (or parts
of these records) except those protected from

replying to requesters and permits assessing fees
in certain instances. The FOIA imposes manda-
tory time limits of 20 workdays for advising
requesters of releasability determinations for
requested records. The law permits an additional
ten-workday extension in unusual circumstances
specifically outlined in the FOIA.
2.
The FOIA applies to:
(A) all records
(B) state and federal records
(C) federal records only
(D) state records only
3.
What is the maximum time the government
has to respond to FOIA requests?
(A) 20 workdays
(B) 10 workdays
(C) 30 workdays
(D) 30 calendar days

“When a thing is old, broken, and useless we
throw it on the dust-heap, but when it is suffi-
ciently old, sufficiently broken, and sufficiently
useless we give money for it, put it into a
museum, and read papers over it, which people
come long distances to hear. By-and-by, when the
whirligig of time has brought on another revenge,
the museum itself becomes a dust-heap, and
remains so till after long ages it is rediscovered,
and valued as belonging to a neo-rubbish age—
containing, perhaps, traces of a still older paleo-
rubbish civilization. So when people are old,
indigent, and in all respects incapable, we hold
them in greater and greater contempt as their
poverty and impotence increase, till they reach
the pitch when they are actually at the point to
die, whereon they become sublime. Then we
place every resource our hospitals can command
at their disposal, and show no stint in our consid-
eration for them.” —Samuel Butler

(A) the world needs more museums

the car and walked to the three-story stone build-
ing on the corner. Becky was visiting the Military
Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) in order to
take her ASVAB test. Even though Sergeant Evans
assured her that she would do fine, she couldn’t
help but be a little worried. This test would
decide her future. The AFQT portion of the test
would decide whether she could even get in the
military, and the other portions of the test would
determine what jobs she would qualify for. Becky
tried to dispel her pessimism by imagining how
she would tell her friends and family the great
news that she had aced the test. They would all
yell and scream and tell her how happy they were
for her. Becky wished she felt more energetic for
this test. She felt tired from the weeks of studying
ASVAB For Dummies and ASVAB AFQT For
Dummies. She hoped all that studying would help.
She was glad it was a multiple-choice test.

Many people confuse Memorial Day and
Veterans Day. Memorial Day is a day for remem-
bering and honoring military personnel who died
in the service of their country, particularly those
who died in battle or as a result of wounds sus-
tained in battle. While those who died are also
remembered on Veterans Day, Veterans Day is the
day set aside to thank and honor all those who
served honorably in the military — in wartime or
peacetime.
11.
The primary purpose of the passage is to:
(A) honor veterans
(B) explain the differences between two
holidays
(C) describe veteran ceremonies
(D) honor the American flag
The Institute of Medicine has released a
report urging the Department of Defense (DOD)
to announce a mandatory date when smoking will
no longer be allowed in the military. The report
also urges DOD officials to immediately cease
selling tobacco products on military installations.
The DOD has long been engaged in a project to
reduce smoking in the military. In fact, 51 percent
of military personnel smoked in 1980, and that
number decreased to less than 30 percent by
1998. However, from 1998 to 2005 (the latest year
in which the DOD conducted a study), the rate
crept up again to more than 32 percent. Among
the services (as of 2005), 32 percent of soldiers,
32.4 percent of sailors, 23.3 percent of Air Force
personnel, and 36.3 percent of marines reported
that they smoked.
12.
Which service has the most smokers?
(A) Army
(B) Navy
(C) Air Force
(D) Marine Corps
13.
The Institute of Medicine wants to:
(A) reduce smoking rates in the military
(B) eliminate smoking in the military
(C) force Congress to pass a law barring
smoking in the military
(D) ban smoking in military hospitals
14.
When is the last time the Department of
Defense conducted a smoking survey?
(A) 1998
(B) 2001
(C) 2005
(D) 2008
Shylinn and Kiley were inseparable, but
Shylinn was the leader of the two. They were not
biological sisters, but they shared everything
from middle school classes to CDs. Shylinn was
tall, blond, and very pretty. Additionally, her self-
assurance made her stand out in a crowd. Kiley
had dark hair and was quiet and rather thought-
ful. Another thing the friends shared, but not
happily, was a crush on Billy. Billy was in their
sixth-grade class and seemed to enchant both
girls. Shylinn always knew just what to say when
she saw him, but Kiley just stood there, silently
blushing.

Practice Exam 4: 
Answers and Explanations
A
re you ready to take the actual ASVAB yet and max out the AFQT score? I sure hope so.
I hope you’re feeling confident as well. If you still don’t feel ready, you may want to look
over the practice exams again, until you’re comfortable with the types of questions that will
be presented on the real test. You may also want to consider reading ASVAB For Dummies
for another full-length AFQT practice exam, as well as three full-length ASVAB practice tests.
The answer keys in the following sections tell you how well you did on the final AFQT prac-
tice exam. Remember: Don’t be too concerned about the percent right or wrong. On the
actual test, harder questions are worth more points than easier questions when computing
your AFQT score, so it’s entirely possible to miss a few questions and still max out your
AFQT score.
Part 1: Arithmetic Reasoning
How’d you do on this subtest? If you don’t feel so good about the results, you may want to
postpone taking the real ASVAB until you’ve gotten some more study time under your belt,
and perhaps taken a math course or two at your neighborhood community college. You may
also want to take another look at Chapters 8 and 10.
Other great resources to improve your math skills are Math Word Problems For Dummies,
Algebra I For Dummies, and Algebra II For Dummies, all by Mary Jane Sterling; Geometry For
Dummies, 2nd Edition, and Calculus For Dummies, both by Mark Ryan; and SAT II Math For
Dummies, by Scott Hatch, JD, and Lisa Zimmer Hatch, MA — all published by Wiley.
1. (C) Kirsten is standing in the middle of a circular track, which means the distance between
her and the outside of the circle is the radius. The radius of a circle equals half of the diame-
ter, so Kirsten is 75 feet away from the runners on the track.
2. (C) If the foodstuff is 0.125 percent vitamin C, then there are 0. 125 grams of vitamin C for
every 100 grams of the foodstuff. This follows from the definition of percent (percent means
part of 100). That means there are 0.00125 grams of vitamin C in every gram of the cereal.
A milligram (mg) is 
of a gram, so 0.00125 grams is equivalent to 1,000 × 0.00125 = 
1.25 mg. In other words, for each gram of cereal one eats, he is getting 1.25 mg of vitamin C.
The goal is 18 mg of vitamin C. 
grams of cereal.
3. (D) First add the cost of the clothes: $53.00 + $39.95 + $9.95 + $9.95 = $112.85.
Allison’s state has a sales tax of 7 percent, and 7 percent of $112.85 is $112.85 × 0.07 = $7.899.
Round this up to $7.90, and add it to the total shopping bill: $112.85 + $7.90 = $120.75.

4. (B) The distance formula is d = rt. This can also be expressed as 
.
Let Jackie’s rate = r. That means Kim’s rate of speed is r – 10.
Compute Jackie’s rate of travel:
r = 66.7
Jackie traveled at an average speed of 66.7 mph. That means Kim’s rate of speed was 
66.7 – 10 = 56.7 mph.
5. (A) Manny’s coupon was only good for 10 percent off one oil change. Therefore, Manny paid
full price for one oil change, and the discounted rate for the second oil change. Set up your
equation as follows:
$21.95 + ($21.95 – [$21.95 × 0.10]) =
$21.95 + ($21.95 – $2.20) =
$21.95 + $19.75 = $41.70
Note that $21.95 × 0.10 = $2.195, but I rounded that up to $2.20.
6. (A) Each 8-foot length of board will provide two pieces of wood, 3 feet by 6 inches long, with 
1 foot of board left over for scrap (2 × 3 feet, 6 inches = 7 feet). Thus, he will need 
individual boards. Because the carpenter can only buy boards in 8-foot lengths, she will
need to purchase four boards.
7. (D) The distance formula is d = rt. Plug in the known values:
Train A: d = 65 × 4 = 260 miles.
Train B: d = 72 × 4 = 288 miles. Train B traveled 288 – 260 = 28 miles farther than Train A.
8. (B) Divide the number of books by 4 to determine how many feet of shelving space will be 
required: 
. Personally, I would build it even bigger. Anyone who owns 225 books 
is going to buy some more, sooner or later.
9. (D) Hopefully, you got this one at a glance. None of the options would provide the amount of
paint required (65 gallons).
10. (A) The distance formula is d = rt. This can also be expressed as 
. Plug in the known
values:
The trucker will be driving a total of 33 hours, but must sleep eight hours for each ten hours 
of driving. That means the trucker must sleep three times during the trip (
). That 
equates to 3 × 8 = 24 hours of sleep. Add this to the total driving time, and you see it will
take the trucker 33 + 24 = 57 hours to deliver his load.
11. (C) Divide the total yearly expense by the number of months in a year: $1,565.16 ÷ 12 =
$130.43.
12. (A) Becky must pay $379 per month for 5 × 12 = 60 months. Therefore, she will make a total
of $379 × 60 = $22,740 in monthly payments. Add this to the $1,500 she made as a down pay-
ment, and you see that Becky paid $24,240 for her new car ($22,740 + $1,500 = $24,240).
13. (D) Multiply the average rainfall for each month by the total number of months: 7.5 × 3 = 22.5.

14. (B) The carpenter’s base pay is $12.30 an hour and his overtime pay is $12.30 × 1.5 = $18.45
per hour. The carpenter earned $12.30 × 40 = $492.00 in base pay, and $18.45 × 6 = $110.70 in
overtime pay, for a total of $110.70 + $492.00 = $602.70 in weekly pay.
His federal tax deduction is $602.70 × 0.23 = $138.62, and he has deducted $150 in child sup-
port for total deductions of $138.62 + $150 = $288.62.
Subtract his total deductions from his weekly earned pay, and you get $602.70 – $288.62 =
$314.08.
15. (C) A kilometer is 
of a mile, so multiply 
, or 
. Mark’s speedometer 
should read 75 mph.
16. (B) You solve this problem by using two separate equations. Let c = the number of chickens,
and d = the number of ducks.
You know the total number of chickens and ducks together is 40. Mathematically, you
express this as c + d = 40.
You also know that the cost per chicken is $2, the cost per duck is $1, and the total cost is
$44. That translates to ($2 × c) + ($1 × d) = $44. For simplicity’s sake, this can also be stated
as 2c + d = 44.
You need to express one of the equations so that it can be used as a definition of one of the
variables in the other equation. Use c + d = 40, because it’s easier — c + d = 40 can also be
expressed as d = 40 – c.
Substitute this with the value of d in the second equation:
2c + d = 44 = 2c + (40 – c) = 44
2c – c + 40 = 44
c = 44 – 40
c = 4
The man bought four chickens.
17. (C) Let x = the number of Nintendo games that Alex has initially; then 3x is the number that
Davy has at the start. If Davy gives six games to Alex, the Davy has 3x – 6 games and Alex
has x + 6 games. After the transfer, Davy has twice as many games as Alex, so you can write
down an equation to represent this fact:
3x – 6 = 2(x + 6)
3x – 6 = 2x + 12
3x – 2x = 12 + 6
x = 18
18. (D) Let x = the milk with 5 percent butterfat, and y = the milk with 2 percent butterfat. You
know that you need to add these together to come up with 60 gallons of milk. This can be
expressed as x + y = 60.
You also know that 5 percent of x, plus 2 percent of y needs to equal 3 percent of the 60 gal-
lons. Express this as 5%x + 2%y = 3%(60). You can convert this equation to decimals to make
it easier to work with:
0.05x + 0.02y = 0.03 × 60
0.05x + 0.02y = 1.8
This equation will be much easier to work with if you get rid of the decimals by multiplying
the whole equation by 100:
5x + 2y = 180
279
Chapter 19: Practice Exam 4: Answers and Explanations

You now have two equations to work with: x + y = 60 and 5x + 2y = 180.
Solve the first equation in terms of y: x + y = 60 can be expressed as y = 60 – x. Substitute
this value for y in the second equation:
5x + 2(60 – x) = 180
5x + 120 – 2x = 180
5x – 2x = 180 – 120
3x = 60
x = 20
The solution will require 20 gallons of the 5 percent milk.
19. (C) Three bags of boiled peanuts cost 3 × $2.49 = $7.47. Four bags of roasted peanuts cost
4 × $3.29 = $13.16. Add these numbers together to arrive at $20.63.
20. (A) To determine the amount of interest earned, multiply the principal ($3,000) by the inter-
est rate (6 percent) and the number of years interest accrues (1 year): $3,000 × 0.06 × 1 =
$180. Add the interest earned to the principal to show how much total money the teacher
would have: $180 + $3,000 = $3,180.
21. (A) Remember: There are 30 questions on this subtest. Divide the number of questions she
must get right (25) by the total number of questions (30) to reach 0.833 or 83.3 percent.
22. (A) Simply add 12 hours to 6 a.m. to arrive at 6 p.m. Central time is one hour earlier than
eastern time, so she arrived at 5 p.m. New Orleans time.
23. (B) You can solve this by expressing the problem as a ratio. 30 minutes is to 8 city blocks, as
x minutes is to 6 city blocks. Mathematically, this would be:
x = 22.5
24. (D) The price of five cases of ramen noodles at regular price is 5 × $5.20 = $26. Mick bought
five cases for 5 × $3.75 = $18.75. Mick saved $26 – $18.75 = $7.25 on this purchase.
25. (A) Convert the fractions so that they all have a common denominator. To do this, you must
find a denominator that all the original denominators can divide evenly into. The numbers
4, 3, and 6 all divide evenly into 12.
You can now add these fractions together:
can be reduced to , which means there are 
or 25 percent of the lures left, and 
25 percent of 20 is 5 (20 × 0.25 = 5).
26. (A) This should be obvious after a quick glance. Mark is closer and traveling at a faster
speed than Mickey, so, of course, he will arrive first.

27. (B) Penelope’s raise is $8.35 × 0.15 = $1.25 per hour. Add the raise to her original per hour
salary: $8.35 + $1.25 = $9.60. Don’t get confused by her per-delivery bonus. It’s a distracter
and has nothing to do with the question asked.
28. (C) The formula to determine the area of a rectangle is A = lw. Plug in the known values:
A = 8 × 10
A = 80 square feet
It costs 75¢ per square foot to clean the rug, so it would cost a total of 80 × $0.75 = $60 to
clean the rug.
29. (C) Divide Joy’s tip amount by her total sales to determine her average tip: 
.
Her hourly wage is not a factor in solving this problem.
30. (B) Because each brick is of equal length, simply divide the total length (44 inches) by the
number of bricks (4): 44 ÷ 4 = 11.
Part 2: Word Knowledge
The Word Knowledge subtest, as with all the AFQT subtests, determine whether you qualify
for enlistment. If you’re not seeing the improvement in your scores that you need to see,

sages. And, after you read each question, you can quickly reread the passage just to make
sure you’re on the money. The information is in the paragraph; you just have to concentrate
to pull it out. Turn to Chapter 6 if you still need additional help to pull off a good score on
this subtest. You can also find more practice questions in Chapter 7.
1. (C) The next-to-the-last sentence in the passage says, “Nothing reduces trust in a group
faster than members saying one thing within the group and something else outside the
group.”
2. (C) The first sentence explains that the FOIA provides access to federal agency records.
3. (C) According to the paragraph, the FOIA imposes a mandatory time limit of 20 workdays to
respond, but permits an additional 10 workdays in unusual cases.
4. (B) The third sentence in the paragraph says that the law allows assessing fees in some cases.
5. (D) The paragraph likens the life cycle of old things to the life cycle of an elderly person.
6. (B) Becky is going to MEPS with her recruiter; she is obviously planning to join the military.
Personally, I think the correct answer should be D. Becky showed great intelligence by read-
ing ASVAB For Dummies and ASVAB AFQT For Dummies.
7. (A) Although the passage doesn’t come straight out and say this, because Becky is visiting
MEPS with her military recruiter, this answer is the most likely choice.
282
Part IV: AFQT Practice Exams 

8. (B) The author states that Becky was tired from weeks of study.
9. (A) The final sentence of the paragraph states that domestic violence is a crime.
10. (D) Domestic violence is unjustified physical or verbal abuse within a family unit. Your
teacher is (usually) not a member of your family.
11. (B) The paragraph explains the difference between Memorial Day and Veterans Day.
12. (D) According to the passage, 36.3 percent of Marines smoke, which is more than in any
other service branch.
13. (B) The first paragraph states that the IOM wants DOD to ban smoking entirely in the military.
14. (C) According to the paragraph, the latest military smoking statistics are as of 2005.
15. (C) The author states that both girls had a crush on Billy, but Kiley was always shy
around him.
Part 4: Mathematics Knowledge
If you’re still missing too many math questions, you may need to take more drastic measures
like enrolling in a basic algebra class at a local community college. If your scores are improv-
ing, keep hitting the books and testing yourself up until the day of the ASVAB. Chapter 8 will
also be a good review.
If you want to increase your math skills, the following Dummies books will help: Algebra I For
Dummies and Algebra II For Dummies, by Mary Jane Sterling; Geometry For Dummies, by
Wendy Arnone; Calculus For Dummies, by Mark Ryan; and SAT II Math For Dummies, by Scott
Hatch (all published by Wiley). Chapter 9 also has some additional practice questions.
1. (B) If the sum of two angles equals 90 degrees, they’re called complementary angles.
2. (A) Determine what your rounding digit is and look to the right side of it. If the digit is 0, 1, 2,
3 or 4, do not change the rounding digit. If the digit is 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9, the rounding digit
rounds up by one number.
3. (D) The shape shown is a rhombus, which is a quadrilateral (a shape with four sides). All
quadrilaterals have angles that total 360 degrees.
4. (B) An equilateral triangle has three sides that are all equal in length. If the sum of two sides
is 50 inches, each side is 25 inches long.
5. (B) The formula to determine volume of a rectangular box is v = lwh. Plug in the known
variables:
v = 18 × 6 × 11
x = 1,188
Volume is always expressed in cubic measurement.
6. (D) The formula to calculate the circumference (distance around) a circle is c = πd. Because
the diameter of a circle is twice its radius, the formula can also be stated as c = π2r. Plug
in the known variables:
c = π × 2 × 5
c = π10
c = 3.14 π 10
c = 31.4 feet
283
Chapter 19: Practice Exam 4: Answers and Explanations

7. (B) The triangle shown is a right triangle — one of its angles is 90 degrees. The Pythagorean
theorem says that if you know the lengths of any two sides of a right triangle, you can find
the length of the third side with the formula, a2 + b2 = c2. Plug in the known values:
a2 = 152 + 172
a2 = 225 + 289
a2 = 514
a = 22.7
The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of all three sides: 15 + 17 + 22.7 = 54.7 feet.
8. (A) Solve an inequality as you would for any unknown:
2 + x ≥8 
2 – 2 + x ≥8 – 2
x ≥6
9. (D) Find a common denominator for the fractions. In this case, 80 works for all the fractions. 
Convert all the fractions: 
; 
; 
; and 
. Comparing the fractions, you 
can see that 
is the largest fraction.
However, finding a common denominator can sometimes be difficult and painstakingly slow.
Another way to compare fractions with different denominators is to use the cross-product
method.
The first cross-product is the product of the first numerator and the second denominator.
The second cross-product is the product of the second numerator and the first denominator.
If the cross-products are equal, the fractions are equivalent. If the first cross-product is
larger, the first fraction is larger. If the second cross-product is larger, the second fraction
is larger.
Compare the first two fractions, 
and 
: 2 × 8 = 16 and 5 × 3 = 15. The first fraction is larger.
Compare the larger fraction 
to the third fraction 
: 2 × 10 = 20 and 5 × 7 = 35. The 
third fraction is larger.
Compare the largest fraction 
with the last fraction 
: 7 × 16 = 112 and 10 × 16 = 160. 
The final fraction 
is the largest of the group.
10. (B) 
, 
, and 8 × 5 = 40.
11. (A) Whenever you multiply two terms with the same base, you can add the exponents: 
x4 × x5 × x–3 = x4 + 5+ (–3) = x6.
12. (D) Whenever you multiply two terms with the same base, you can add the exponents:
(y2y3)6 = (y5)6.
Whenever you have an exponent expression that is raised to a power, you can multiply the
exponent and power: (y5)6 = y5 × 6 = y30.
13. (C) Simplify, then isolate x:
(5 + 3)(6 ÷ 2)(8 – 1) = (3 + 7)x
8 × 3 × 7 = 10x
10x = 168
x = 16.8
284
Part IV: AFQT Practice Exams 

14. (B) Substitute 3 for all the x’s in the equation:
xx × x = 33 × 3 = 27 × 3 = 81.
15. (D) 
16. (C) To determine all the possible ways in which the horses could finish the race (called per-
mutations), solve for factorial. 7 factorial (7! = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 5,040).
17. (D) Whenever you have an exponent expression that is raised to a power, you can multiply
the exponent and power: (72)2 = 72 × 2 = 74 = 7 × 7 × 7 × 7 = 2,401.
18. (D) Multiply the first number in the first set of parentheses with the first number in the
second set of parentheses. Then multiply the first number in the first set of parentheses
with the first and second number in the second set of parentheses, respectively:
(x + 4)(x + 2) =
[(x × x) + (x × 2)] + [(4 × x) + (4 × 2)] =
x2 + 2x + 4x + 8 =
x2 + 6x + 8
19. (B) Convert the yards to feet. There are 3 feet to a yard, so 7 × 3 = 21 feet and 21 feet + 14
feet =35 feet.
20. (C) First, convert 14 percent to a decimal by dividing it by 100: 
. Multiply 
this by 42 to determine what 14 percent of 42 is: 42 × 0.14 = 5.88. Round this number up to 5.9.
21. (B) Mean is another word for average. To find the mean of a series of numbers, add the num-
bers together, and then divide sum by the number of items: 10 + 28 + 50 + 71 + 91 = 250 and 
.
22. (A) In division, if one number is positive and the other is negative, the result is negative.
23. (C) The sum of angles for a triangle is always 180 degrees.
24. (C) Begin by putting the problem into a fraction: 
. Now convert the fraction to a decimal: 
0.666. Because percent means “part of 100,” move the decimal place two spaces to the right
to get the number expressed as a percent: 66.6 percent.
25. (A) You didn’t expect to see such an easy one, did you? I got tired of writing harder problems.
(Not really. You’ll see a few very easy problems on the mathematics knowledge subtest. It’s
not a trick.)

Chapter 20
Ten Tips for a Better AFQT Score
In This Chapter
 Setting up a study plan
 Using the practice examinations
 Boosting your math and communicative scores
T
he U.S. military enlists around 317,000 new troops each and every year. And all those
men and women share one thing in common: They all earned a qualifying score on the
AFQT. (See Chapter 2 for qualifying AFQT scores for each service.)
Many people score very high, which makes their mothers proud and their recruiters smile. It
also opens up a new world of special enlistment programs and enlistment incentives that are
available only to those who score well on the AFQT.
I’m sure you want to be counted among the group who score well on the AFQT. Otherwise,
why would you be reading this book? If so, this chapter will be a big help. Here I list ten sure-
fire ways to maximize your AFQT score and get you on your way to a satisfying and success-
ful military career.
Take Your Time
Don’t cram. I don’t care whether you call it a “power study,” “mega-brain feeding,” or
“mugging” — it doesn’t work. Study after study has shown this. For example, a 2007 study
conducted by University of South Florida psychologist Doug Rohrer determined that last-
minute studying reduces retention of material and may hinder the learning process.
Rome wasn’t built in a day, but it took only a few hours for the city to crash and burn. If you
develop a solid study-plan and stick with it for six to eight weeks, you’ll score much higher
on the AFQT than if you try to pack four subjects’ worth of knowledge into your brain in one
or two days. Plus, you won’t walk into the testing center with your eyes red and your brain
fried.
Make a Study Plan
You wouldn’t expect the U.S. military to fight a war without a plan, would you? It would be
disorganized chaos, and probably nothing would be achieved. The same is true when study-
ing for the AFQT (or doing anything else, for that matter). If you try to study without a plan,
you’ll wind up wandering here and there, reading this and that, but you won’t really accom-
plish anything.

Start by studying the subjects you find the hardest, and spend extra time on those areas. It’s
human nature to want to read about things and study areas that you’re good at. Remember
that, so you can counteract this instinct.
Use the Practice Exams to Your Advantage
If you bought this book expecting the practice exams to include the exact same questions
you’ll see on the ASVAB, I’m afraid I have bad news: You won’t see the same questions on the
ASVAB that I include in this book (or any other ASVAB/AFQT preparation guide). Giving you
the actual questions and answers in advance would be cheating — and illegal. The military
classifies ASVAB tests as “official use only.” That means only those with an official “need to
know” have access to the test questions and answers — and that certainly does not include
authors of ASVAB AFQT prep books.
The best I can do is to provide you with practice questions that are very similar to the ones
you’ll see on the ASVAB. In short, don’t waste your time trying to memorize the questions
and answers on the practice exams.
Even so, the practice exams are a very valuable study tool. Not only do they give you an idea
about the type of questions you’ll see, as well as the test format, but they’re useful in deter-
mining what AFQT subject areas you need to spend the most time on.
Here are my recommendations for taking the exams:
 Practice Exam 1: Take this test before you set up your study plan. You can use the
results of Practice Exam 1 to determine which areas of the AFQT you need to spend the
most time on.
 Practice Exam 2: Use this test as a progress check after a week or two of study. Adjust
your study plan accordingly.
 Practice Exam 3: Take this practice exam about a week before you’re scheduled to take
the actual ASVAB. Use the results to determine which AFQT subjects need a little extra
attention.
 Practice Exam 4: Take the final practice exam a day or two before the ASVAB to make
sure you’re ready, and to boost your confidence.
If you’ve already taken some or all of the exams and you didn’t follow this schedule, that’s
okay, too. The key is to take the exams and learn from them.
Memorize Basic Math Formulas
The Arithmetic Reasoning and Mathematics Knowledge subtests require you to know many
standard mathematical formulas used in geometry and algebra. As a minimum, you should
have the following committed to memory by the time you sit down to take the ASVAB:
 Perimeter of a square: p = 4s, where s = one side of the square
 Area of a square: a = s2
 Diagonal of a square:
290
Part V: The Part of Tens 

 Perimeter of a rectangle: p = 2l + 2w, where l = the length and w = the width of the
rectangle
 Area of a rectangle: a = lw
 Diagonal of a rectangle:
 Perimeter of a triangle: p = s1 + s2 + s3, where s = the length of each side of the triangle
 Area of a triangle:
, where b = the length of the triangle’s base (bottom) and h = 
the height of the triangle
 Radius of a circle:
, where d = the diameter of the circle
 Diameter of a circle: d = 2r
 Circumference of a circle: c = 2πr
 Area of a circle: a = πr2
 Volume of a cube: v = s3, where s = the length of one side of the cube
 Volume of a rectangular box: v = lwh, where l = the length, w = the width, and h = the
height of the box
 Volume of a cylinder: v = πr2h, where r = the radius of the cylinder and h = the height of
the cylinder
 Surface area of a cube: SA = 6s2
 Surface area of a rectangular box: SA = 2lw + 2wh + 2lh
 Distance formula: d = rt, where d = distance, r = rate, and t = time
 Interest formula: I =prt, where I = interest, p = principal, r = rate, and t = time
Memorize the Math Order of Operations
When a math problem asks you to perform more than one operation, you need to perform
the operations in the set-in-stone correct order:
1. Start with calculations in brackets or parentheses.
Note: When you have nested parentheses or brackets — parentheses or brackets
inside other parentheses or brackets — do the inner ones first and work your way out.
2. Work on terms with exponents and roots.
3. Do all the multiplication and division, in order from left to right.
4. Finish up with addition and subtraction, also in order from left to right.
Boost Your Vocabulary
The Word Knowledge subtest is nothing more than a vocabulary test. This subtest contains
questions that ask you to find the word that is “closest in meaning” to a given word. The
more words you know, the better you’ll do on this subtest. It’s that simple. (For more on how
to boost your vocabulary, check out Chapter 4.)
291
Chapter 20: Ten Tips for a Better AFQT Score

Comprehending What You Read
To do well on the Paragraph Comprehension subtest, you must be able to read a paragraph,
pick out the main point(s), find implied meanings, and analyze what you’ve read.
Practice this task daily by reading a paragraph in a newspaper or magazine, and then asking
a friend to question you about information included in that paragraph.
Arriving at the Test Site 
Refreshed and Prepared
Don’t let the recruiter schedule you to take the ASVAB until you’re sure that you’re ready.
Recruiters sometimes have a habit of trying to get you tested as soon as possible so they can
fill their recruiting goals. However, if you don’t achieve a qualifying AFQT score, you waste
your time, your recruiter’s time, and the military’s time. Remember: You may have to wait for
up to six months for a retest. (For more on retesting, turn to Chapter 2.)
The ASVAB test takes about two and a half hours, and by the time you’re finished, you’ll have
answered 216 questions. Give yourself a head start against the fatigue factor by arriving well
rested and motivated. Get a good night’s sleep on the night before the test. If you’re traveling
to the test site in a bus or car, try to get a quick catnap during the journey — as long as
you’re not the one doing the driving, of course!
Try to eat a light meal or snack just before the test. You don’t want your grumbling stomach
to distract you from solving a quadratic equation.
Watching the Clock
You only have a limited amount of time to complete each subtest, but don’t worry about it.
The more you panic, the more likely you are to make mistakes. Just work at a steady pace,
and you’ll do fine.
If you’re taking the computerized version of the ASVAB, there will be a counter on the screen,
counting down the time remaining on the subtest. If you’re taking the paper version of the
ASVAB, a clock will be clearly visible on the wall and the test proctor will post the start and
stop time of the subtest, where you can easily see them.
Here’s how the time breaks down for the subtests that make up your AFQT score:
 Arithmetic Reasoning: 30 questions in 36 minutes. That’s 72 seconds per question.
 Word Knowledge: 35 questions in 11 minutes. That works out to 18 seconds per
question.
 Paragraph Comprehension: 15 questions in 13 minutes. That’s 52 seconds per question.
 Mathematics Knowledge: 25 questions in 24 minutes. That’s 57 seconds per question.
Don’t spend too much time on one question. If you’re drawing a blank, make a guess and
move on (see the next section).
292
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Guessing Smart
If you’re stuck on a question, before making a wild guess, first try to eliminate any answers
that you know to be wrong. If you can eliminate even one wrong answer, you increase your
chances of guessing the right answer from one in four to one in three. If you can eliminate
two wrong answers, your chances increase to 50/50. (For more tips on intelligent guessing,
see Chapter 3.)

’ll be the first to admit, ASVAB AFQT For Dummies is a great book. Quite possibly the
greatest book ever to be published (my well-known modesty aside). However, I can’t
pack everything there is to know about math, vocabulary, reading, and joining the military
into 336 pages. You may have to rely on some outside help.
If you need to brush up on some of your skills before taking the ASVAB and maxing out your
AFQT score, reading the appropriate chapters in this book is a great place to start. But you
may need or want even more work in a particular subject area, or you may want to know
more about the military, or even the entire ASVAB. This chapter helps you find what you
need. Here I list places you can get additional information if the chapters of this book leave
you wanting more.
For More about the ASVAB
This book is about boosting your Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) score, but this
score is only comprised of four of the nine ASVAB subtests. Although the AFQT score is
very important — because it determines whether you’re qualified to join the military (see
Chapter 2) — the other subtests of the ASVAB are used to determine which military jobs
you qualify for.
If you want to brush up on all the ASVAB subtests, an excellent resource is my very own
ASVAB For Dummies (Wiley), if I do say so myself. You can pick up a copy at your favorite
bookstore or at www.dummies.com.
For More about the Military
If you’re thinking about joining the military, presumably you want to learn more about how
the military operates. The following Web sites are great resources:
 About.com: Much as I would like to, I don’t spend all my time writing For Dummies
books. I spend much of my time running a military information Web site. Here you can
find a huge vault of invaluable information about military careers, including what basic
training is like, military job descriptions, promotion tips, assignments, and military pay
and benefits. There is even a discussion board where you can get your questions
answered, and talk with current military members and veterans from all the service
branches. Point your browser to http://usmilitary.about.com.

 DefenseLINK: To figure out what the military is up to, you can stop by the official Web
site of the Department of Defense. The site is a treasure trove of military information
articles and photos. Go to www.defenselink.mil.
 Army recruiting: If you’re thinking about joining the Army, the Army’s recruiting Web
site is an essential first stop. Here you can read about Army enlistment qualification
and Army careers, and even chat online with an Army recruiter. Visit www.goarmy.com.
 Air Force recruiting: If you want to soar with the eagles (F-15 Eagles, of course), you
should check out the Air Force recruiting Web site at www.airforce.com.
 Navy recruiting: If you aren’t the claustrophobic type, and you’re thinking of a career
aboard a submarine (or maybe an aircraft carrier), check out the official Navy site at
www.navy.com.
 Marine Corps recruiting: The Marines have a few good men (and women) standing by
at the Marine Corps recruiting Web site to help you become one of the proud few.
Check them out at www.marines.com.
 Coast Guard recruiting: The Coast Guard is a military service, but it doesn’t belong to
the Department of Defense. Instead, it falls under the organization of the Department of
Homeland Security. You can find out about joining the Coast Guard at www.gocoast
guard.com.
For More about Math
The Mathematical Knowledge and Arithmetic Reasoning subtests on the ASVAB make up half
of your AFQT score. If you want to do well on these tests but haven’t had to use your math
skills since you got that nifty calculator, check out the following resources:
 A slew of For Dummies math books: Algebra I For Dummies and Algebra II For
Dummies, both by Mary Jane Sterling; Geometry For Dummies, 2nd Edition, and Calculus
For Dummies, both by Mark Ryan; and SAT II Math For Dummies, by Scott Hatch, JD,
and Lisa Zimmer Hatch, MA — all published by Wiley — are great places to start.
Check your favorite bookstore or visit www.dummies.com.
 AAA Math: AAA Math can help you review math problems from kindergarten through
eighth grade. The Web site features a comprehensive set of interactive arithmetic les-
sons, with unlimited free online practice. Visit www.aaamath.com.
 High School Ace Math: Designed specifically to help high school students ace those
frustrating high school math tests, High School Ace Math is an excellent study refer-
ence for those who want to do well on the Mathematics Knowledge subtest. Give it a
try at http://highschoolace.com/ace/math.cfm.
For More about Math Word Problems
Solving math word problems requires a special set of skills. You not only have to know basic
math, but you must analyze the problem, determine how to set up an equation, and then
solve it. Algebra I For Dummies, Algebra II For Dummies, and Geometry For Dummies (see the
preceding section) can be a great help in understanding word problems, but you may want to
start with Math Word Problems For Dummies, by Mary Jane Sterling (Wiley). Also, check out
Purple Math at www.purplemath.com/modules/index.htm.

For More about Vocabulary
You can’t get a good score on the AFQT without doing well on the Word Knowledge subtest.
These resources can help you boost your vocabulary knowledge:
 Vocabulary For Dummies, by Laurie E. Rozakis, and SAT Vocabulary For
Dummies, by Suzee Vlk (both published by Wiley): Head to your favorite bookstore
or www.dummies.com.
 FreeVocabulary.com: This site has over 5,000 free vocabulary words along with their
definitions — a great resource for anyone looking to improve his vocabulary.
 ImprovingVocabulary.org: This site offers free tips for improving your vocabulary. If
you want, you can purchase their software program, which is designed to make you a
word wizard in no time.
For More about Reading Comprehension
If you need to brush up on your reading skills for the Paragraph Comprehension subtest, or
even if you just want to speed-read your way through War and Peace, try these sites:
 MrNussbaum.com: Dozens of reading comprehension exercises at your fingertips. Take
a look at www.mrnussbaum.com/readingpassageindex.htm.
 Resource Room: This site offers tips, techniques, and exercises to help improve your
reading comprehension skills. Go to www.resourceroom.net/comprehension.
For More about Test Taking
The best way to prepare for the AFQT is to develop a sound study plan and make sure you’re
prepared for the test. However, even with the best preparation, a question or two may trip
you up. Chapter 2 has some great tips to help you take the test. Here are some other
resources:
 TestTakingTips.com: This site offers tips and techniques about studying, note taking,
reducing test anxiety, and taking tests.
 Study Guides and Strategies: This site gives ten great tips for terrific test taking. Take
a look at www.studygs.net/tsttak1.htm.
Playing at Public Libraries
Remember when you learned math and English in high school? You were taught from stan-
dard textbooks. It turns out, those same textbooks are a great resource to help you review.
However, have you ever priced a standard textbook in a bookstore? Holy cow! No wonder
our education system always seems to be out of money.
297
Chapter 21: Ten Topics to Explore

If only there were a place where you could borrow math and English high school and college
textbooks for free. . . . Wait a minute! There is such a place! It’s the public library, and most
towns and cities have one. Not only can you borrow standard textbooks, but libraries offer you
a calm and quiet place to study, away from the hustle and bustle and demands of daily life.
Consorting with Colleges
Some people are just not good at studying on their own. They prefer organized classrooms,
specific assignments, and teachers to explain things. If you’re one of these people, you may
want to consider enrolling in a math, vocabulary, or reading course at your local community
college. Who knows? You may even qualify for state or federal student aid and be able to take
college courses for free!
Supplementing your AFQT knowledge through college courses offers a couple big advantages:
 If you have a GED and get at least 15 college credits, you boost your chances of being
accepted for enlistment by a factor of at least 10.
 If you get over 30 college credits, you may qualify for advanced enlistment rank.
Trying Out a Tutor
Another great thing about colleges and universities: They usually have a group of highly
intelligent students who are anxious to supplement their incomes by tutoring other students
in a variety of subjects. Even if you decide not to enroll in college courses yourself, what
could be better than having some cute girl or guy help you prepare for the AFQT subtests?
To find a tutor in your area, visit the administration office of your local college or university.
Or just walk around campus and look at the bulletin boards — students often advertise their
tutoring services on fliers.
