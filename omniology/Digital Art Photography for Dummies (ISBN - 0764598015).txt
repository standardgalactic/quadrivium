About the Author
Several years ago, Matthew Bamberg began to photograph for the articles he
was writing while working for the alternative paper, the Desert Post Weekly.
His writing focuses on popular culture: essays about topics from the Santa
Cruz, California surf culture to the mid-century modern architecture revival
around the world. Curious by light striking his lens (direct and bold or soft
and willowy) and the sounds (especially of the shutter opening and closing),
he struck a relationship ﬁrst with ﬁlm and then, like so many, with the digital
camera’s sensor.
Aside from writing about f-stops, shutter speeds, and the fabulous job the
digital camera manufacturers have done that permit photographers to take
almost noiseless pictures in the dark at high ISO speeds, Matt has written
content and provided photographs for articles on Homestore.com, America
Online, and The Weather Channel.


Dedication
I dedicate this book to my parents Harold and Estelle Bamberg, who as pho-
tographers themselves collected and stored hundreds of negatives, positives,
and prints that I took as a kid and that they took themselves. They also sup-
plied me with every trendy camera that came onto the market, which provided
me with a foundation to have an additional set of eyes to capture the world.
Author’s Acknowledgments
First, cheers to Nicole Sholly and Teresa Artman, who guided the progress
of this book and offered dozens of solutions and ideas in its development.
To them, a heartfelt thanks. Thanks also to: Robert Stone for his patience
teaching me the ins and outs of landscape photography in Paris and Vietnam;
Robert Jones of Insightful Solutions for guidance for Internet and Web site
photography; Roger Vail for his wonderful nighttime carnival photography
(http://we.got.net/~rvail/recent/recent.html); the expertise of
sports photographer Drew Brashler; and Rich Glass and infrared photogra-
pher, Robert Contreras (www.robertcontreras.com) who helped widen the
book’s focus. Also of assistance were the Borgan, Taylor, and Bodon families
whose ideas, photos, and patience modeling for dozens of shots made the
process not work but fun. I can’t forget the valuable assistance in shooting
provided by Dr. Suellen Evavold, Trixie Mauleon, and Kelly Lewis and son,
Chase. And keeping me on track, offering aesthetic advice on hundreds of
photos as they progressed through Photoshop and moved onto the printed
page, was Todd Larson. My experiences with all the staff of City Art (Van Nuys,
California) helped to make this book a completed cycle by giving insight to
one of the most important stages of the art photography process: framing an
image. Selling the image, too, needs to be recognized. To that end, I thank
James Claude and Miguel Linares of Palm Springs Consignment, a mid-century
modern gallery in Palm Springs, who took me in as a street photographer by
selling my mid-century modern signage series, a series that took me to some
dicey neighborhoods all over the world to capture a piece of the past. Thanks
also to John Bernard and Beverly Walker of the modern furnishing gallery,
Room Service, who brought and sold my work to the big city (Los Angeles)
and Jay Nailor of M Modern Gallery (Palm Springs) who took my work to the
gallery level and who was never more than a phone call away.

Digital Art Photography For Dummies 

Introduction
I
n this book, I cover the art form of digital art photography. I start by giving
you an introduction to the world of film-based photography and how it
relates to digital photography. From there, I go on to cover the whole gambit
of digital art photography, from shooting great photos to tweaking them in
Photoshop to producing final output fit for a gallery wall. If that sounds intrigu-
ing, this book is for you whether you’re film-based or digital-only or both.
About This Book
Here are some of the things this book will help you do:
 Get a fabulous, well-exposed photograph, no matter what your shooting
conditions
 Tweak, edit, and enhance your images to create something entirely new —
or just simply better than what you started with
 Produce gallery-worthy art prints
 Find out when it’s time to upgrade your computer to handle graphics work
Foolish Assumptions
I don’t like to be foolish, but to use this book, I assume that you know the basics
of photography, whether digital or film. (I do sprinkle loads of photography
tidbits throughout, so no one is stranded.) I also assume that you know how to
use a computer and have maybe played around with Photoshop or some photo
editor application. Most important of all, I assume that you have a burning
desire down deep inside to unleash your creative side by producing — and
even selling — truly artistic, awe-inspiring photographic prints.
Conventions Used in This Book
By conventions, I simply mean a set of rules that I employ in this book to pre-
sent information to you consistently. When you see a term italicized, look for
its definition, which I include so you know what that term means in the context
of digital art photography. Sometimes, I give you information to enter onscreen;
in those cases, I format what you need to type bold. Web site addresses and
e-mail addresses appear in monofont so that they stand out from regular text.

Digital Art Photography For Dummies 
What You Don’t Have to Read
Because I structure this book modularly — that is, so you can easily find only
the specific information you need — you don’t have to read whatever doesn’t
pertain to your task at hand. You also don’t have to read the Technical Stuff
icons, which parse out uber-techy tidbits (which you might or might not be
interested in).
How This Book Is Organized
Digital Art Photography For Dummies is split into five parts. You don’t have to
read parts sequentially; you don’t have to read each chapter in each part;
and you don’t even have to read all the sections in any particular chapter.
(But I think that you’ll want to look at every picture. . . .) You can use the Table
of Contents and the index to find the information you need and quickly get
your answers. In this section, I briefly describe what you’ll find in each part.
Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture
This part serves as an introduction to the world of art photography and how it
relates to digital photography. In Chapter 1, I detail the five essential steps to
creating a digitized masterpiece and provide a few essentials of composition.
Chapters 2 and 3 cover the digital side of digital art photography; I have to
admit, this information can get a little dry and techy. (Don’t say I didn’t warn
you.) When it comes time to purchase a new digital camera or to upgrade your
computer to handle all the heavy-duty graphics work you’ll be doing, however,
you’ll be glad you have these two chapters by your side. In Chapter 4, things
get fun again while I brainstorm with you to decide just what kind of digital
art photographer you want to be.
Part II: The Photo Shoot
Part II is all about getting great shots, and so I dive right into ISOs, f-stops,
exposure settings, and when to use a flash. This part runs the gamut, from
shooting great photos outdoors or indoors (Chapters 5 and 6) to photograph-
ing people and animals (Chapter 7) to shooting for great color or outstanding
black and white (Chapters 8 and 9) to capturing stunning nighttime images
(Chapter 10) to achieving wonderful effects before you ever get to Photoshop
(Chapter 11) — whew! That’s a lot of photography!

Part III: Photoshop Art: Using Software 
to Enhance or Create Art Photos
If you’re anxious to repair or jazz up some old photos, use Chapter 12 as
your guide. In that chapter, I discuss various Photoshop tools and techniques
that can bring back vivid color to images 50 years old or eliminate annoying
scratches and dust. Chapter 13 is where you can find out how to merge
images into one giant photograph, and Chapter 14 gives you the lowdown
on using Photoshop layers (a great tool for creating digital art photography).
I couldn’t not discuss Photoshop’s filters, so I include a whole chapter on
them (Chapter 15).
Part IV: The Final Output: Gallery-Worthy Prints
Drum roll, please . . . the moment you’ve all been waiting for. Just itching to
click that Print button so you can hold your masterpiece in hand and admire
it lovingly? This is the part for you. In Chapter 16, I discuss all things that
have to do with managing electronic files (a tedious albeit necessary part of
digital art photography), and Chapter 17 covers printing prep and printing.
Then comes the really fun part: matting and framing. Chapter 18 has all the
information you need to make your art presentable to the world (and paying
customers).
Part V: The Part of Tens
I would be remiss in my duties if I didn’t include a Part of Tens. So here you’ll
find ten rules — or if you prefer, guidelines — of digital art photography
(Chapter 19) and ten snappy digital art tricks (Chapter 20).
On the Web site
I had so much to tell you about this exciting topic that I couldn’t fit it all into
the book, so you’ll find two bonus chapters at www.dummies.com/go/digital
artphotos. Bonus Chapter 1 discusses photo sets, which are a great way to
present, package, and reuse your saleable art. For example, if you have a slew
of dog images — say, several huskies — frame them as a set to create a col-
lection that husky-lovers will sit up and beg for. Bonus Chapter 2 covers using
text to enhance your art photography. Here I discuss manipulating text in
both Word and Photoshop and adding text to your image to create an entirely
new piece of art, like a poster, invitation, greeting card, business card . . . you
get the idea.

A
rt is the product of human creativity: a medium to create pleasure as
well as express the conditions of life and feelings. Art also records his-
tory: who we are; what’s around us; and how we interpret life, feelings, and
interpersonal interactions. This concrete expression has come in many forms:
prints, drawings, paintings, and sculpture. With today’s digital technology,
however, the art form of photography reaches new creative levels, taking on
new forms as people flock to this new digital medium.
In this book, I cover the art form of photography. Whether you’re a
film-based photo purist or firmly entrenched in the digital-only
camp, you’re covered. This chapter serves as an introduction
to the world of photography and how it relates to digital
photography. I begin with a brief discussion of digital
art photography before moving on to the five essential
steps to creating a digitized masterpiece. Finally, I
end the chapter with a crash course in composition.
Defining Digital Art Photography
Digital images — whether from a digital camera,
scanned from film or print, stills from a camcorder, or
something from the Web — can be defined as any artwork
stored electronically. After you have a digital image tucked
into the hard drive of a computer, the chip of a cellphone, or
the memory inside a digital camera, you can
 Manipulate it with a mouse click. You can change your image’s color or
size, take away blur (a new tool in Photoshop CS2), make it look like a
painting with filters, and emulate many photography techniques without
having to go to the trouble of shooting with lots of extra lenses and filters.

8
Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
 Keep it indefinitely without deterioration. Digital images don’t crease,
bend, or crumble like traditional hard copies. They don’t pick up stains
from fingerprints or (yikes) coffee, either.
What few people think of and what makes this book special is how the digital
image is conceived. In this book, digital images encompass those born again
(or for the first time) into the digital world, including
 Scanned original art: You can scan an illustration or a painting as easily
as you can scan a photograph. Then, if the art is yours to manipulate,
you can open it in Photoshop and create a digital work of art.
 Scanned photo negatives and
positives: Figure 1-1 is a scanned
positive (a slide). I scanned it
into my computer by using a
Hewlett-Packard (HP) Scanjet
5470C. I had the original slide
tucked away in some old family
photos. It dates from the 1960s,
but now it’s digital.
 Scanned print photos: Scan
prints just like you would scan
negatives and positives. This is a
great way to make repairs to old
photographs (see Chapter 12)
or to combine images to create
a digital masterpiece (see
Chapter 13).
 Electronically tweaked cre-
ations: After you scan some-
thing or download images from
your digital camera, you can
tweak that digital file in an
image editor, electronically
enhancing its beauty for sale as
a gallery-quality digital print.
(For more about printing and
preparing your work for gallery exhibition, see Part IV.) Figure 1-2 is
an image of a sunset that was tweaked in Photoshop to enhance
its color and contrast. Would anyone ever know it was tweaked in
Photoshop? That’s a question that you should be thinking about
when reading this book.
Figure 1-1: A scanned slide becomes part of
the digital realm.

Figure 1-2: Tweak photos in Photoshop to enhance color and contrast.
Most of the time, you want to keep your image as natural as possible. Your goal
is to clean up dust specks and scratches from print photos or to enhance color
and contrast without overdoing it — that is, without producing annoying noise,
those specs of color that make your images look unnatural. A little tweaking
can go a long way.
Long discussions have ensued among many photographers, amateur and pro-
fessional alike, as to what format is better: digital or film. There’s really no
answer, but some people are adamant about one or the other. Take a look at
Table 1-1 and judge for yourself which is better. Whatever the case and what-
ever medium you use, don’t be shy about trying out both from time to time.
Each has its advantages, and it’s a fun ride to see what you get when the light
shines on your film or on your digital sensor. (A digital sensor is a small device
inside a digital camera that captures picture info and sends it to the storage
inside the camera.)

Mastering Five Steps to Creating 
a Gallery-ready Art Print
A gallery-ready art print is one that is defined continually throughout this
book — through many examples and for many types of photographs, from
old reproductions to the newest, swiftest digital art around. From taking a 
traditional portrait to making text-based art from a photograph, you’ll travel
through a land of light, space, time, and patience (remember, anything digital
can get quirky) to create some of the most original and high-quality work
around. Photographers who take the time to capture and print superior quality
images by adhering to these five steps, each a creative process in itself, pro-
duce gallery-ready art prints that turn viewers into buyers who will enjoy the
work for a lifetime.

1) Define yourself, your subject matter, 
and your audience
When making choices about what to photograph, think about what interests
you. If it’s sports, you’ve got it made with an abundance of uniformed players,
cheerleaders, and wild fans in the bleachers. If it’s rare and exotic orchids in
Guatemala that you long for, your trek is likely a bit more arduous but doable.
And if you really don’t know what you want to photograph — or whom to
create photographs for — go directly to Chapter 4 where I discuss defining
yourself as a photographer as well as your audience and subject matter.
2) Master your craft and hone 
your photographic skills
Photography, like any art form, is based on some basic rules of composition,
such as the Rule of Thirds and using a vanishing point. After you master
those composition techniques, you can put your own artistic interpretation
of a scene into your art photo. After all, it’s your art and your photo, and you
can do with it what you want. Read through the remainder of this chapter for
more specifics on all things composition, including use of geometry, color,
and cropping. The more you can create and manipulate in-camera, the less
you have to do in your image editor and when printing. Also, see Chapters 8
and 11, where I cover shooting for great color and achieving special in-camera
effects, respectively.
3) The trek from camera to computer
Snapping a photograph is only the beginning. Digital art photography requires
following certain paths before you can print and frame your output (final image),
including
1. Getting the image into your computer: You do this either by transfer-
ring the files from your digital camera to your computer or by digitizing
a film photo, in which case you want to scan either the photograph itself
or (even better) its negative. (Remember, after transferring a film print,
positive, or negative into the computer, it becomes digital.) Chapter 3
covers scanners; see Chapter 16 for more about transferring images.
2. Digitally tweaking the image: With your image open in Photoshop (or
your image editor of choice), there’s practically no end to the tweaking
that you can do. You can crop an image, apply filters to it, resample it,
use layers to merge it with other images . . . the list goes on. See the
chapters in Part III for more about image editing.
11
Chapter 1: Digital Art Photography 101

12
Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
3. Saving your image in the appropriate file type: Whether you’re shoot-
ing with a high-end digital single lens reflex camera (dSLR) or a mid-level
point-and-shoot model, the files in which your camera stores your pic-
tures are ultimately saved in a high-resolution format called TIFF, which
is a file format that I describe in Chapter 2. Your digital image might
travel across a number of devices and platforms before it’s ultimately
printed.
4) Print images
After you complete Step 3 — that is, you’ve tweaked, you’ve resized, the color
is perfect, and the photo is ready for the world — just press Print, and you’re
good to go. Okay, the printing process is more involved than that. In Chapter 3,
I discuss what types of printers are available. And in Chapter 17, I discuss the
whole printing process in detail.
5) Frame your masterpiece
When you have your printed image in hand, you’re almost to the finish.
Following are your three choices for framing your digital photograph:
 Take your photos to your local framer and have mats and frames made.
This is mostly for those who want a select look for their home or office
that matches exactly to their décor. It’s not a cost effective route for those
who want to sell their prints framed.
 Cut your own mats and make your own frames. This is a great way to
get your work framed if you’re a carpenter. Many people take this route
but buy the frames premade from a wholesaler while cutting the mats
themselves.
 Buy your mats precut and your frames from a wholesaler or your local
discount frame store. Hey, for people starting out (and even for people
who do the art show circuit), this isn’t a bad idea.
For creative framing options, see Chapter 18.
Composing an Art Photograph
The difference between someone who takes pictures and an art photogra-
pher is that the latter realizes that the cornerstone of fundamental design is
composition. Folks easily take this element for granted, getting swept away
by coolness or locale of the subject. Composition is more than what your
subject is and how it’s posed: It comprises all that plus the background, 

foreground, color, lighting, and framing. Always remember to compose first
and expose second.
All great photographs start with sound composition techniques, which are
basic rules of how to put together a pleasing image. When you compare two
shots (say, using the same subject and lighting), one of a sloppily composed
image with one that’s thoughtful and crafted, you can immediately tell the dif-
ference. And when you follow these rules, remember that you follow in the
footsteps of masters of art and architecture: The ancient Greeks and Romans
practiced these same tenets 20 centuries before the advent of photography.
It’s obvious in their architecture.
Most photographs need a focus — anything inherently interesting to your
viewer, from a looming tree and its shadow to a church’s dome. Figure 1-3
shows a pair of pictures: The left image has too many unnecessary objects
in the frame that render the image unfocused; the right image is composed
artfully.
Figure 1-3: Provide a focus for the subject(s) of your photos.
And, by the way, call ’em guidelines instead of rules if you want. Know, too,
that after you master these guidelines, you can bend them to your artistic
desire.
Simplicity
Keeping your shots clean and uncluttered is paramount to presenting a great
art photograph. That’s not to say that you can’t shoot something detailed
13
Chapter 1: Digital Art Photography 101

14
Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
and ornamented, but make sure
your audience sees what you want
to show, not a photo cluttered with
unnecessary background distrac-
tions. Read more about this in the
upcoming section, “Foreground,
background, and depth of field.”
For example, consider the architec-
ture of the Sydney Opera House.
People gather around this Australian
landmark, snapping pictures left and
right. To present this wonderful
architecture artfully to your viewer
(or to present any subject artfully
to your viewer), crop it boldly and
closely — either while you shoot
(ideally) or later in Photoshop if 
necessary. By doing so, you can
retain your viewer’s focus on this
monument only and nothing else,
as shown in the two images in
Figure 1-4.
As a general rule for landscape and
architectural photos, leave about 1/3
of the top of the photo for the sky.
Balance
Akin to using simplicity is the art of
balance. Achieving good balance
means paying careful attention to
how you arrange shapes, colors, or
areas of light/dark to complement
one another so that the photograph
has interest but isn’t lopsided. (Try
to avoid centering the subject; read
more about this in the section on the
Rule of Thirds.)
When using symmetrical balance,
the two halves of an object look the
same — they are mirror images of
each other, if you will. In the Greek
islands (and elsewhere), gates and
foyers are often built symmetrically,
as shown in Figure 1-5.
Figure 1-4: Full frontal photos of massive
architectural monuments need to be framed
and/or cropped tightly.
Figure 1-5: Symmetry is a forced balance.

You can use asymmetry to give a
less formal yet balanced feel to
your shots. This image of a bird
with its beak sticking out of the
cage (Figure 1-6) is unsymmetrical
yet balanced. You can use simple
geometry to help create balance.
For more on that, see the later sec-
tion, “Identifying lines in photos.”
Rule of Thirds
I show examples of the Rule of Thirds through-
out this book. This composition principle is based
on the theory that the human eye gravitates 
naturally to a point about two-thirds of the way
up an image. Thus, images with the subject or a
dominant dividing line that falls in the upper or
lower third of an image is pleasing. Hint: By visu-
ally dividing the image into thirds (vertically or hor-
izontally), you can asymmetrically balance, as I
discuss in the preceding section.
Imaginary lines divide the image into thirds both
horizontally and vertically. You place important 
elements of your composition where these lines
intersect. In Figure 1-7, you can visualize those
imaginary lines that denote where the one-third and
two-third marks fall horizontally and vertically in
your photograph.
When you’re shooting a wide area of land or water,
the third-line will usually be two-thirds up from the
bottom, as shown in Figure 1-8.
15
Chapter 1: Digital Art Photography 101
Figure 1-6: Asymmetry offers viewers a less
formal perspective.
Shadow dancing
Have you ever been caught playing with your
shadow, stretched into a seemingly infinite length
at dusk, skipping, jumping, straddling, and stretch-
ing to the sky? Well, why not take a picture of it
or have someone else photograph those slick
moves? Taking a variety of impressions of yourself
by photographing your shadow on different back-
grounds offers an artful perspective of your life.
Figure 1-7: Follow the Rule of
Thirds for visual appeal.

16
Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
Figure 1-8: Even in this thin landscape, the third-line is two-thirds from the bottom.
Conversely, if you want to showcase the sky — like for a remarkable sunrise
or sunset — your main line is effective one-third up from the bottom, as
shown in Figure 1-9.
All about light, shadows, and shades
Capturing light — how you want to show and exploit it — truly defines pho-
tography. After all, photography literally means light writing. You can use light
to paint, illuminate, mask, shadow, and color your subject almost limitlessly.
Use light to your advantage to capture everything from blasting saturated
color to ethereal backlit fog and mist to stark silhouettes. For more on reading
light when shooting outdoors and indoors, see Chapters 5 and 6, respectively.
For great techniques on capturing light when shooting black-and-white, see
Chapter 9. And for shooting in virtually no light, see Chapter 10 for the low-
down on night photography.
Photographing landscapes and people with strong late afternoon or early
morning sun in front of you creates a silhouette, as shown in Figure 1-10.
Figure 1-9: Third-lines that divide sky from sea should fall one-third the way up the frame.

Figure 1-10: Photographing into the late afternoon sun creates a silhouette effect.
You can also use light and shadow at night
to add depth to photographs, sometimes
making them look similar to paintings.
Older buildings that show wear offer your
camera’s sensor a brush stroke effect in its
interpretation of the light’s reflection on the
worn stone. 
Many of the best architecture and land-
scape photographs are shot at dusk. The
long shadows, soft light, and reflections
can create dramatic results. For instance,
Figure 1-11 shows a quiet street scene
made dramatic by the long shadows
caught at dusk. (In Chapter 9, I further 
discuss shooting architecture photos 
in the context of black-and-white 
photography.)
17
Chapter 1: Digital Art Photography 101
Figure 1-11: Shadows cast at dusk add
a dramatic dimension to your images.

18
Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
Don’t be afraid to exploit contrast
when calculating the proper light for
exposure. After you get the hang of
your camera’s auto settings, master
how to set your exposures manually.
(More on that in Part II.) For exam-
ple, in Figure 1-12, you can see how
the light paints the outlines of the
multicolored leaf.
Recognizing lines, shapes, and forms
You probably learned as a kid that two points make a line and that four lines
fit together to make a rectangle. Later in life, you also likely learned about
intersecting lines, parallel lines, and all the types of triangles. Then 3-D
spaces of area and volume were next.
I know, I know: “It’s math — ugh, geometry, at that! — and you can’t make me
like it any more than spinach.” However, with a minimum of effort, you can
quickly discover how to use lines, triangles, and all things geometric to help
compose photographs that are compelling and full of life.
Also, don’t overlook capturing texture and form repetition as strong composi-
tional tools.
Identifying lines in photos
Vertical, horizontal, diagonal, curved, zigzag — straight lines come in many
forms. And lines don’t have to be
straight, either: Don’t forget ovals,
curves, and circles.
In the earlier section on the Rule of
Thirds, you can see how a simple
horizontal line can effectively divide
a shot. Now flip that line on the bias
(a 45° angle) to show how using a
strong diagonal line can add more
interest and a dynamic sense, as
shown in Figure 1-13. In this image,
the paths of the two women, along
with the painted street lines, form
diagonal lines.
Figure 1-12: An under-lit leaf is painted with light.
Figure 1-13: Diagonal lines add interest.

When you’re out and about — running errands or just going for a walk —
really look at the lines in your world. Try to notice straight lines (fences and
sidewalks), parallel lines (railroad tracks), soft and slinky curves (like a cat
stretching), or undulating waves (like the overpass shown in Figure 1-14).
Figure 1-14: Undulating lines catch the eye.
Using geometric shapes and forms
After you become better at identifying lines in a
potential shot, start looking for geometric forms
to mimic. Your viewer likely won’t even realize
your trick but will be attracted to the composi-
tion of an image when you cleverly hide a trian-
gle, like the example shown in Figure 1-15. 
(Oh, so I did manage to sneak in some spinach,
after all.)
Shapes don’t have to be linear, either. You can
use a rounded shape to draw attention to your
subject, as shown in Figure 1-16. (Image that: Circles and repetition!)
19
Chapter 1: Digital Art Photography 101
Figure 1-15: Natural triangles
add interest.

20
Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture

Figure 1-16: Rotundas provide an excellent study in circles.
Now take the triangle technique
one step further, using one to cre-
ate a vanishing point. When you
arrange lines to converge in a dis-
tant point — usually at a corner of
an image — you create a vanishing
point. Perhaps the lines don’t truly
disappear off the edge, but they
look as though they could, as
shown in Figure 1-17.
More importantly, the lines and geo-
metric shape immediately pull your
eye to the place of interest you craft
via composition. When lines are
repeated — even when they repeat
but end in a jumble, like a pile of
sticks — you create even more
visual interest. In Figure 1-18, notice
how the repetition of a line draws
your eye up the image.
Figure 1-17: Capture lines to form a vanishing point.

Figure 1-18: Use repeated lines for visual interest.
Repeating a geometric shape can also be quite
effective. You can often find this technique in
architecture, as shown in Figure 1-19.
Texture
A basic micro-element of art — a mark — can be
considered like a mini-line. When that mark is
repeated, that creates texture (on a small scale,
like the fur of a cat) or repetition (like a woven
pattern in cloth), as shown in Figure 1-20.
Figure 1-20: Indulge your viewers with texture.
Subject placement
Be cognizant of how you place your subjects. Avoid sun shining right in their
eyes (see Chapter 5), having odd things in the background seemingly sprout
from their heads (see the upcoming section, “Foreground, background, and
21
Chapter 1: Digital Art Photography 101

built into architecture.

depth of field”), and having them in motion to disappear from an image, as
shown in Figure 1-21.

Figure 1-21: Careful how you place your subjects.
The risk of Impressionism
Claude Monet’s Impression, Sunrise (in the Musée Marmottan
Monet, Paris) plays with light and shadow on canvas. About a
century and a half ago, Monet took a risk by painting in a differ-
ent way, re-creating the natural environment that surrounded
him. Soon others began painting with dabs of color that come
together when you step back from the work and view it as a
whole. The Impressionist movement got its name when art critic
Louis Leroy commented that Monet’s work wasn’t finished. Up
until that time, works of art were more realistic. A painting of a
garden, for example, was expected to approximate reality and
not be just an “impression.”
Just like Monet took a risk, so can you. The following figure illus-
trates a risk that a photographer can take when filming and
manipulating images to give photographs an Impressionistic feel.
Take a picture on a rainy day and you get a picture looking 
as if it was painted with short brush strokes a century and a 
half ago.

Take the extra minute and consider these points about your subjects when
composing:
 Frame them in the shot’s context.
 Identify line shapes that you can exploit.
 Calculate how much (or how little) of the object you want in your picture.
 Choose what angle to shoot from.
 Create dimension and, by con-
text, show more than just the
face/main portion.
Deciphering color
Looking at color is a matter of
observing the world around you.
As your kids grow up, their hair
changes shades. (Um, yours does,
too.) And those bananas you
bought at the store the other day
morph from yellow-green into deeper
shades of yellow (and if you don’t eat
them, brown). Also, color changes —
sometimes extraordinarily — under
different light; the shades of the
desert re-create themselves from
dawn to noon to dusk, from yellow
to pink or even green, depending
on the weather, light, and season.
And perceptions can play with color.
To one person at one moment, red
can appear bright and cheery or war-
like and aggressive. Color perception
also changes on your object/subject
when other colors are nearby. A
green object can shift to more yellow
or blue depending on the colors of
the object next to it or the color of
the foreground and/or background,
as shown in the three fruit images in
Figure 1-22.
The colors you see around you can
depend on sunlight, atmospheric
conditions (clouds, rain, haze), and
season. (Light is always softer in
23
Chapter 1: Digital Art Photography 101
Figure 1-22: Different background colors cause
subtle perception changes.

24
Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
spring and fall.) You can also affect how your camera sees color with some of
its settings. For more on color pho-
tography, see Chapter 8.
To understand how to effectively
capture color, you need to under-
stand a wee bit about the beast.
It’s all pretty simple, and you likely
know more than you think you do.
Three primary colors — red, yellow,
and blue — inside a triangle are at
the center of a color wheel (shown
in Figure 1-23). Next come the trian-
gles of secondary colors — orange,
green, and violet — that are made
from mixing the primary colors.
It’s this group of triangles that
points the way around the rest of
the color wheel, to the tertiary
colors.
Use this wheel to find complementary colors
that are on opposite sides of the wheel — for
example, red and green. You can also use one 
section or side of the wheel to find colors in the
same tonal family — for example, pink, salmon,
and orange. (Note: These types of color usually
go well together but at the expense of contrast.)
To create contrast, choose complementary
colors, like the orange and blue in Figure 1-24.
Understanding positive 
and negative space
In Figure 1-25 are photos of an outdoor sculpture from two different vantage
points, which shows how positive and negative space changes. Negative
space is the space in between and around the object. An object in a picture is
the positive space of the picture. Sculptors constantly evaluate the negative
space as they mold their art, noticing not only the object itself (the positive
space) but also the space between it (the negative space). As a photographer,
you can exploit both spaces, too.

Positive and negative space tell you the following about your picture:
 What shape and form the object is: Forms without jagged edges —
smooth and even-rounded — are more pleasing to the eye in an art
photo. Smooth round rocks (the positive space) among brilliant sky
(the negative space) offer a viewer comfort in nature in Figure 1-26.
 How much of the object occupies the picture: If the positive space is
small, it should stand out in some other way, such as being a bright color.
If it’s large, like an extreme close-up of a person, it’s more interesting if
it shows some sort of emotion: excitement, concern, or disappointment.
This emotion can be seen in the eyes or somewhere unexpected, like in
puffy cheeks or a toothy smile.

Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
 How the subject and object interact: Whether your subject is in motion
or static makes a big difference in how the distinction between the
spaces is outlined. The way in which the two spaces meet affects how
the picture will react to image manipulation. Rapidly changing tones
within a small area sometimes gather pixels of disparate colors with
tweaks in Photoshop, but more about that in Chapter 15. Also, the more
dimension the object has, the more complicated the interaction between
the two spaces.
 How busy the space is: A busy shot is
bad for art photos because when too
much is going on, the viewer has no
focus. That being said, millions of suc-
cessful art pieces are very busy. It just
depends on trends and what’s out in the
culture and/or community as a whole.
Figure 1-27 is a photo that is, well, just
too busy with too much going on. Your
viewer’s eyes will just juggle looking at
the picture.
Foreground, background, and depth of field
Right off the bat, you can’t talk about backgrounds and foregrounds in pho-
tography without addressing depth of field. Basically, the depth of field is how
much of your picture is in focus. Some photos have detail throughout the
foreground and background with no blur, and others show a subject clearly
with blur in the background.
You can use Photoshop to make a blurred background clear and vice versa,
but it’s done in kind of a roundabout way to get a good result. Turn to
Chapter 14 for more about making backgrounds with Photoshop layers.
So why would you want any blur at all in a photograph? Blur creates an illu-
sion of dimension, movement, and, sometimes, even the suggestion of a sixth
sense. To make a variety of art with your state-of-the-art digital equipment,
keep these points in mind:
 The clarity of the negative and positive space: If you have a picture
with a blurred background and want it clear, you’ll probably have to
replace it with a clear background from another picture in Photoshop. 
 The number and dimension of your subjects: If your picture is a simple
2-D negative/positive-space photo, tweaking it in an image processing
program is fairly easy. You can use almost any option to make a good art
photo. For more about cleaning up pictures in Photoshop, see Chapter 12.

Figure 1-27: This shot is so busy that
the viewer has nowhere to focus.

The sharper the distinction between foreground and background, the easier
you can process, transfer, and manipulate the foreground and background in
an image processing program.
Small is relative. Tiny objects cast in massive backgrounds can be missed, so
those tiny objects need to have a certain eye-catching something. When you’re
casting something small in a big background, make that small object colorful
and memorable.
Having little or no background can make a photograph dramatic. In a portrait,
such a shot is an extreme close-up, which is a type of photograph that reveals
expression in all the features. In Figure 1-28, the focus is solely on the subject.
But note how the subject is shifted to the right, leaving some background — a
space that assumes some importance in the picture.

Chapter 1: Digital Art Photography 101

28
Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
Often, pictures with large foregrounds
and just a little background can give
the viewer a sense of being right in
front of the subject.
And don’t forget to scrutinize your
background when composing and
shooting. Who hasn’t taken a photo
of someone with an errant phone
pole or tree growing out of some-
one’s head (as in the top image in
Figure 1-29)? Sure, you can prob-
ably clean up your image later in
Photoshop, but if you’re careful to
begin with, that’s just less manipula-
tion to do later (as in the image on
the bottom in Figure 1-29).
Perspective
Showing a different angle or perspec-
tive of a subject can lend an artsy
feel to a photograph. To experiment
with this, walk around your subject,
keeping your eye to the viewfinder to
see how the light in the foreground or background changes with your differ-
ent camera positions. Don’t forget to move up and down, too. Sometimes
shooting from above or below (as in the left image of Figure 1-30) gives you a
feeling that’s quite different from your normal eye level (as in the image on
the right in Figure 1-30).

Figure 1-29: Be mindful how you place your
subjects.
Stay tuned for the weather
All the atmospheric elements (humidity, temper-
ature, wind, and so on) that make up the weather
comprise one long color equation. Each item is a
variable that on any given day and at any given
moment influences the appearance of color in
the world around you. Some environmental cir-
cumstances have almost no effect on the color
you see while others give your eyes a feast of
tones and hues.

Figure 1-30: Change perspective to add that artistic edge. 
In-camera cropping and framing
Perhaps the most valuable technique at your disposal when shooting is to
crop judiciously. Think of this from a pragmatic view: What’s the point in all
that wasted space that you later have to crop in an image editing application?
The more base image you have to work from, the less noise you get when you
enlarge your image. See how Figure 1-31 could have benefited from more in-
camera careful cropping?
Too, paying attention to in-camera framing lends to the craft of the shot,
adding a professional touch. Use framing to visually lead the viewer into the
scene or add a softened edge for effect.

S
o you decided to jump into this century and go digital, eh? Bully for you!
This chapter (and the next) cover all those nuts-and-bolts kinds of digital
photography issues — you know, the digital side of digital art photography. 
Whether you’re a budding photographer whose first foray involves
using a digital camera or a film buff who wants to use tradi-
tional and digital film technology, this chapter walks you
through some of the jargon and nuances between these
two formats to help you along your path.
The Digital Path
Any image that ends up in your computer is digital —
that is, bits of data organized electronically. Even if a
photo begins on film, it ends up being digital when you
scan it into your computer. Ever look at a photo attach-
ment in an e-mail? Maybe it started out as a hard copy
print from film, but you view it in digital format. Your goal
when making the digital leap is to manipulate those bits of
data with electronic means — your computer, some image editing
software, and perhaps a scanner — to create an image that looks simply fan-
tastic and cutting edge, no matter what special effects you do (or don’t) apply.

32
Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
Think of your photographs taken with your digital camera or scanned from
film or prints as the beginning of making a product in a factory. The image
goes through a process:
1. Snap the picture.
2. Store the image.
• Film: This step has two parts: The first takes place in a processing
machine or dark room where the film is developed into negatives
and/or positives; during the second part, the image is developed
onto photo paper.
• Digital: The image is stored as pixels, which are tiny picture ele-
ments made of bits of data, inside your camera.
3. Move the image file into your computer.
• Film: Scan a printed photograph or a slide (a positive).
• Digital: Transfer the image from your camera to your computer.
4. Leave the image as-is or tweak it within an image processing program.
5. Print the image.
You can use your own printer or take it to a service bureau.
To get your image through this process, you need a certain amount of equip-
ment: camera, lens, scanner, printer, and so on. Read on for an overview of
digital cameras and camera peripherals; this overview is designed to help
you acquire the proper tools for your needs. I also discuss resolution issues
and file types (two topics that you never need to know to use a film camera!).
See Chapter 3 for an overview of the other parts necessary for digital art 
photography: computer, scanner, and printer. Then progress to Part III for
the lowdown on manipulating images in image editing software. Part IV
shows you how to prepare your final output.
Film versus Digital
Because film has been around a lot longer than digital camera sensors, take a
minute to compare the new technology with the old. Sure, in some ways, photos
taken with a digital camera beat those taken with a film model hands-down,
but the digital world isn’t a black-and-white world — as with most things in
life, there are many shades of gray. For every privilege you get with the tech-
nology, you have to be careful because each format has its inherent pluses
and minuses, which are described in the upcoming Table 2-1.

For example, compare the viewfinders on a film camera with a digital model.
You look through a film camera viewfinder, but most digital cameras use an
LCD display, akin to a mini TV screen. Viewfinders on digital single lens reflex
(dSLR) models, however, are very similar to film SLR models.
 Most cameras that have an attached lens come with an LCD screen
viewfinder. This viewfinder (as in Figure 2-1) is a nice feature to have
(no discomfort from the camera against your face), but it does have a
slightly different perspective than what you actually get after your pic-
ture is taken.
Figure 2-1: Most digital cameras use LCD viewfinders.
 The viewfinder on a high-end
dSLR camera uses what a
35mm SLR camera does.
Optical viewfinders on profes-
sional digital cameras are the
same ones used on professional
film cameras. These use a prism
to split the view, so the picture
you take is pretty much what
you see through the lens, as
shown in Figure 2-2.

If you’ve been a film photographer for most of your life, your eye has proba-
bly been glued to the viewfinder of your camera. Thank goodness they also
put one on digital SLR cameras because that LCD viewfinder takes some get-
ting used to.
Of course, both film and digital cameras each have other advantages and dis-
advantages. Table 2-1 provides a brief overview. Some factors will undoubtedly
matter more to you than to someone else. Similarly, you can also compare
digital and film images, as shown in Table 2-2.

Don’t ditch your scanner if you decide to use only a digital camera from now on.
Just because you have all your images stored digitally on a tiny chip doesn’t
mean that you don’t want to be able to copy some older ones from prints.
(You don’t want to forget about how you looked way back when.) Sure, old
crackly photos can be retouched in Photoshop (see Part III), but they have to
be scanned first.
Digital Camera 101
Choices, choices. Just like when choosing a film camera, don’t let all the
options, bell and whistles, and knobs bamboozle you. Read through the follow-
ing sections to help make your equipment purchasing decisions. Be prepared
to pony up a bit of cash when you go high-end digital, but you can find a lot
of features on moderately priced models. And prices come down all the time,
so first determine what features you want/need and then shop around.
Digital camera types
You have many types of digital cameras from which to choose. Here’s a brief
overview of each. Because prices for each drop so quickly, take a look at online
and local newspaper ads for accurate pricing. Expect to pay a few hundred
bucks for the low-end models (compacts) and work your way up into the
thousands for a dSLR with bells and whistles.
 Ultracompact: These microcameras are Twiggy-thin.
 Point-and-shoot: About the same size as a subcompact, some of these
have some manual settings.
 Subcompact: These easily fit in your shirt pocket; most have some
manual settings.
 Prosumer: These are similar in size to a dSLR; some have detachable
lenses.
 dSLR: These are the best models going, featuring all the manual settings
of a film SLR.
Choosing a digital camera that takes good-quality images is easy and relatively
inexpensive. You can choose from a variety of megapixel (MP) prosumer digi-
tal cameras and dSLR cameras from which you can use a number of controls
to create art.

Figure 2-3 shows typical subcompact, prosumer, and dSLR models. (Note:
dSLRs and film SLRs look very similar when comparing higher-end models.)
 Basic digital cameras: There
are dozens of digital cameras
(including the ones that are an
option on cellphones) that take
your basic digital picture, all
great for sending images to
friends and/or posting images
on the Web. As far as printing a
clear 8" x 10" print, however,
you’re better off spending a
little extra on a prosumer
model, which I describe in
the next bullet.
 Prosumer digital cameras:
Prosumer cameras offer far
better quality than those cam-
eras built into cellphones or
those cheaper low-end model
digital cameras. You could
label these as mid-end cameras.
If you’re getting serious about
your digital photography, these
are the cameras to buy.
 dSLRs: These are the gold (or
platinum) standard of the digital
photography world. Expensive
(but coming down in price),
these cameras do their best to
replicate the best 35mm film
cameras. (And an added bonus,
you can use the lens from your
film camera on the dSLRs.)
If you do have money already invested
in lenses, make sure to purchase a
digital camera that’s compatible with
those lenses. You’ll also find that stick-
ing with the same brand of camera as
you go digital reduces the learning
curve — most options and controls
will already be familiar to you.

Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
How digital cameras work
Digital cameras use sensors to record the images that you shoot. There are
three categories of sensors:
 Foveon: A kind of simulated film sensor, where pixels are processed
within the sensor with an added color enhancement similar to film
 CCD: A charge-coupled device, where pixels are processed outside the
sensor
 APS: Active Pixel Sensors, where pixels are processed within the sensor
You see the acronym CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor)
most commonly for APS devices.
Each uses a technology that forms the image coming through the lens into a
digital format. They are easy to use and allow the user to immediately review
the photo. You can keep, download, or manipulate the photo electronically in
your computer, tweaking and cropping it so it looks like it could be published
in a newspaper or magazine, and adjusting the image for best results. A digi-
tal camera is basically a computer with a lens that scans an image, stores it
digitally on removable storage, has a built-in monitor for viewing, and can
download the image to a computer. Digital cameras have most of the features
found in film cameras, such as zoom lenses, built-in flashes, lens adjustments,
timers, and more. Most high-end digital cameras use optical viewfinders for
framing the image.
dSLR cameras look identical to their film counterparts and operate similar to
them, too. Both prosumer and dSLR models have different sophistication
levels of these features. In a nutshell, consider these factors:
 Optics: The optics of digital cameras comprise the zooms, exposure
compensations, white and color balances, and a whole slew of controls
that come to your fingertips after you make your selection. The zoom
is how the image can be enlarged without losing resolution. For more
information about optical and digital zooms, see Digital Photography For
Dummies, 5th Edition, by Julie Adair King (Wiley).
 Metering: The metering in your camera helps you to use light distribu-
tions correctly within the area of the photograph you’re taking.
 Focusing system: The focusing systems on most digital and film cameras
currently come with an autofocus and also have a manual focus system.
 Sensor resolution: The sensor resolution is the number of pixels the
image carries at the camera’s maximum resolution setting. The more,
the merrier — that is, increased clarity.

The whole megapixel (MP) thing
Megapixels determine the quality (clarity) of a digital image that’s taken with
a sensor in a digital camera. A pixel is the composition unit of a digital image.
(Just like a byte is the smallest unit of memory storage, a pixel is the smallest
unit in an image on a display screen.) Images that you take with your digital
camera have a lot of pixels — a million or more (hence, mega). When you
shop for a digital camera in a store, the first thing that the salesman tells you
is how many megapixels it has.
The quality of a digital camera’s image is measured in millions of pixels
(megapixels, MP). The higher the number of megapixels, the greater the 
resolution. For more about resolution concerns, see the later section,
“Resolving Resolution Issues.”
Thus, a 5MP camera can capture a shot with more pieces of information
than a 2MP camera. Sometimes bigger is indeed better. Again, prices vary
and can come down quickly. Assess your needs: For example, are you striv-
ing for gallery-quality images, or can you make do with a bit less? You can
easily spend over $1,000 for high-end models (>6MP), but you can find a good
2MP model for about $100–$200. Expect to shell out $200–$350 for a model
between 4 and 6MP. Of course, pricing for MP capacity also depends on
whether the model is a dSLR.
You can compare prices and other options online at sites like
www.buyersedge.com/landing/digital_cameras.asp
If you’re beginning to make art photos, you’re best off with a camera that can
take a high-quality image that can be enlarged to 8" x 10". After you master
that arena, you can move up to giant sizes, and those are determined by the
type of printer you have (see Chapter 17). Here’s how to tell how much MP
muscle you need:
 <2MP: Under-2MP cameras aren’t really capable of producing a clear
enough image for a high-quality art photograph. To give you an idea of
what you could expect, many cellphones have camera capabilities in the
2MP range.
 2–4MP: Cameras with this oomph are great starter cameras and can pro-
duce some pretty good 5" x 7" prints that are great, especially if you
have a series of them in similar frames.
 4–6MP: These guys can produce some mighty good 8" x 10" images.
When shooting these under the right light conditions, you can produce
gallery-quality photographs.
 >6MP: These beasts can produce 8" x10" prints — and even larger 
photographs — of stellar quality.

Chapter 2: Making the Digital Leap

Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
The physical size of a digital camera’s sensor also plays a role in the quality
of the image captured. Generally speaking, larger is better. Some digital cam-
eras include a sensor that’s the same size as a frame of 35mm film; others use
a smaller sensor. When you explore digital cameras, you might also come
across the extremely expensive digital backs for medium- and large-format
studio cameras, which capture images of 20MB, 30MB, and more.
How is image quality affected if you’ve got two cameras, both with 8 or more
MP but each with a different size sensor? It’s the light. The bigger sensor of a
dSLR reads light better, creating deeper colors and better contrast. Images
from each camera will be clear and can be used for gallery-quality photos,
but the size of the sensor does make a difference.
The dSLRs in the near-$1,000 price range are 6- and 8MP models with sensor
sizes around 16 x 24mm. In contrast, the two-third-inch (about 17mm) sensor
size of some 6-, 7-, and 8MP digital cameras is dramatically smaller, perhaps
the size of a man’s thumbnail. These models are usually not dSLRs but rather
point-and-shoot to prosumer models described in the previous section, “Digital
camera types.” About a dozen film camera companies offer a wide variety of
digital cameras and dSLRs. Canon, Fuji, Hewlett-Packard (HP), Kodak, Leica,
Minolta, Nikon, Olympus, and Sony: You name it, and they probably have it —
from models that take pictures in JPEG format to models that shoot in Raw
format, the latest in digital photography technology. Read about both file
types in the later section, “Understanding File Types.”
Most of the time, the closer the specifications of the camera are to those of a
film camera, the better the digital camera.
Lenses
You can change lenses on your digital SLR camera just like you can with a
film SLR camera. And best yet, you can use some of the same lenses from
your film camera. This isn’t possible with a fixed-lens digital camera. If you’re
moving to digital for good and don’t want to waste your investment in lenses,
consider investing in a dSLR model of the same brand as your film camera
when switching from film to digital.
The principles of lens attachments and/or digital camera zooms and wide
angle lenses are similar to that of film. An all-purpose zoom lens should meet
most of your photography needs. Just about every camera has one of these.
A zoom lens lets you press a button (on digital camera models) to change
focal lengths without changing lenses. Many film point-and-shoot cameras
work the same way. The variable focal lengths of this kind of lens make it 
all-purpose. You can shoot at wide angle for one exposure and then use the
normal (standard) or telephoto lens for another.

Many cameras and digital cameras come with built-in lenses that have a lim-
ited focal point range — that is, one where it’s a challenge to catch a good bit
of horizontal or vertical (if you turn the camera on its side) space.
A good all-purpose lens for art photography should have at least a 28–105mm
lens or the equivalent depending upon sensor size. For more about lens size
equivalents for sensors smaller than 24mm x 36mm, see the “Focal lengths”
sidebar, later in this chapter.
As an art photographer, you need to be quick. Life happens fast — there
one minute and not the next — like people on the red carpet of a film open-
ing, a comet in the sky, or a horseless carriage driving on the freeway. You
have to think to yourself about what you want to carry with you and how
much time you’re going to have. If you have to tote a duffle bag with a
variety of lenses that have to be changed from shot to shot, you’re better off
shooting things that are static and/or anchored. A good camera with an all-
purpose lens is best to have with you at all times if you need to shoot your
art photos fast.
Deciding what lenses to use comes down to the types of objects in your pho-
tographs and the amount of time you have to shoot them. On your digital
camera’s zoom lens push button zoom controller, the T means telephoto or
zoom in, and the W means wide angle.
 Telephoto: Use a telephoto lens
(as I did in Figure 2-4 to close
in on just one part of a large
sculpture) and a dSLR camera
if you’re going to shoot from far
away.
Sports photographers and
the infamous paparazzi use 
telephotos, as do some fashion
photographers (who use loud-
speakers to communicate with
their subjects). The telephoto
lens compresses a larger area in
front of the subject, which helps
to soften human features and
blur the background. If you’re looking to get close and/or have a 
picture-perfect portrait, you should, too.
41
Chapter 2: Making the Digital Leap
Figure 2-4: Use a telephoto lens to get close.

42
Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
 Wide angle: Use a wide angle lens (wide angle
zoom lenses have lengths such as 16–35mm
and 10–22mm; see Figure 2-5) and a dSLR
camera if you’re going to shoot architecture
and landscapes, or in any situation where
you need a panorama. For example, a shot of
a swimming pool’s length is best presented
as a panorama so that the focus of the shot
is just the pool (with little or no background),
long and ready to jump into.
A panorama doesn’t necessarily have to be a
picture that’s very wide; it can also be a verti-
cal picture showing something extraordinarily
tall. Steer your panorama shots with wide
angle lenses (or your zoom set to wide angle)
in an up-and-down orientation. For instance,
take the elaborate doors of European archi-
tecture that are ten times the height of the
average person. Set a person in the shot and
you’ve got vertical drama, as shown in
Figure 2-5.
With this type of photography, you also
probably need a tripod to avoid camera
shake.
Fish-eye: A fish-eye lens gives you maximum
lens distortion so that objects are magnified
in the center and diminish in size and clarity
in all directions in proportion to the lens’s
shape. Superwide angles cause this type of
distortion. Some would consider it an error,
but others would see it as art. Figure 2-6 is a fish-eye view, one that
offers offbeat distortion for your art photos.
Figure 2-5: Some architecture
is best shot using wide angle
vertical shots.
Focal lengths
Many digital cameras have zoom lenses whose
numbers might look funny if you’re used to the
focal length numbers on film lenses or digital
cameras with sensors the size of 35mm film. For
example, a 5MP Kodak EasyShare CX 7530
camera has a lens that measures 5.6–16.8mm,
which is equivalent to a 35mm film lens that’s
34–102mm. The effective length of the lens
depends on the physical dimensions of the
camera’s sensor — the area on which the light
coming through the lens is spread. A camera with
a sensor measuring 14.8mm x 22.2mm (rather
than 35mm film’s 24mm x 36mm) has a conversion
factor of about 1:6.
Some companies, including Kodak, have started
to put the film equivalent on the lens itself to
lessen confusion about the in-fact value.

Settings
Many digital cameras come with dif-
ferent modes: preset settings that you
can choose for certain lighting and
shooting scenarios. For example, you
can choose an auto setting (see Fig-
ure 2-7; let the camera choose what it
thinks is best), shutter priority, aper-
ture priority, or manual control (you
make all the exposure decisions).
Some cameras also have drive modes,
which allow you to fire off quick shots
in succession (great for sports and
actions shots). See the Cheat Sheet
at the front of this book where I list
the modes and their functions.
Settings are influenced by the ISO setting you choose. ISO refers to how sensi-
tive you set the sensor to read light; for more on ISO, see Chapters 5 and 6.
Of course, for total creative control, use all manual settings to control aper-
ture and shutter speeds. For more on these settings, see Chapter 11.

Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
Flash and flash attachments
Ever wonder why people who’ve been photographed using a flash look scared?
The human eye — of the subject, in this case — isn’t used to powerful bursts
of light, like what a flash omits. Eyes need time to adjust to changes in light.
Hence, you often get that deer-in-headlights look. This makes flash photography
tricky. Too, you have to know how to achieve adequate and even illumination.
To overcome these limitations when using a flash, first begin by understanding
the average built-in flash:
 Range: Built-in flashes have a range of up to 10 feet. If your subject is far-
ther away than that, the flash will fall short.
 Quality: Flash light is harsh unless you soften it by bouncing it off walls,
whiteboards, umbrellas, and other diffusing devices.
The best light is ambient light — light that comes from all around you —
and that just doesn’t happen with a built-in flash.
If you have a dSLR, you can always augment or replace your camera’s built-in
flash with a flash attachment. (The only type of digital camera that can take
an additional flash attachment is a dSLR model.) Of course, any time you add
an attachment to your camera, it becomes more cumbersome. Still, here are
reasons why you might want to attach a more powerful flash to your camera:
 Flash technology has become sophisticated. Some flash units can simu-
late a good lighting situation from a pretty good distance, some up to
40 feet. There are flash extender units (handy if you’re using a lens greater
than 300mm) that can shoot light over 40 feet when used as a flash fill.
(For more about flash fill, see Chapter 5.)
 You’re shooting outside in low light, and no other light is available.
For example, a flash attachment is very handy if you are filming the
red carpet celebs at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah.
Each camera company makes its own flash attachment. For example, Nikon
makes the SB 800 AF Speedlight, which is a flash attachment that is inter-
changeable on both its film SLR and dSLR cameras.
Work with your built-in and/or flash attachment by taking pictures with it to
assess its effectiveness and range.
Your built-in camera flash is triggered when your shutter moves. You can
mount different types of flash attachments to your camera. Many in-camera
flashes offer uneven light, sometimes blasting all in one place so that your
subject looks unevenly lit. Flash attachments work wonders to eliminate
these light blasts by providing much more powerful flash over which you
have more control:

 A hot shoe is a space on your camera into which you can secure your
external flash. Using a hot shoe enables your camera to control many
aspects of the flash from the camera’s flash options, such as flash expo-
sure compensation. The flash exposure compensation lets you control
the amount of light from your flash that you want cast over your subject/
object. 
 Some flash units, such as the Canon Speedlite 580 EX, can determine
your camera’s sensor size so that it throws out evenly dispersed light
over your entire frame. You can also adjust the way the flash gives off
light through options within the flash unit settings. Many of these units
swivel and tilt so that the light can be thrown at wide angles and bounced
off walls and whiteboards and at varying focal lengths.
 Mid- to high-level external flash attachments have motors that move
the flash outward in front of the camera. (The closer the bulb is to the
camera, the wider the light will be cast.) The zooming motor can be
adjusted each time you change your focal length.
 Many external flash units use AA batteries. Some can accommodate high
voltage battery packs; all operate so that the battery life lasts throughout
heavy flash picture taking at long events, such as a wedding.
For more on shooting in low-light situations, see Chapter 6.
Batteries
Digital cameras use a lot of batteries. Many point-and-shoot models use two
AA batteries that will usually last through several dozen shots.
Internal battery packs are rechargeable units that you take out of the camera
and recharge by securing them into a charging unit that you plug into a wall
outlet. Recharging time can vary from several hours to less than one hour
depending on the model. If you use your camera’s LCD viewfinder and flash
a lot, the batteries will be sucked dry quickly. Some dSLR cameras offer
optional external battery packs for extended operation.
Buy another rechargeable battery if you do a lot of shooting. When you have
an extra, you can charge one while using the other (and you’ll always have a
charged battery on hand).
Batteries are simple to load. Look for your typical sliding/slot door. If all else
fails, read the manual. Check out
www.imaging-resource.com/ACCS/BATTS/BATTS.HTM
for a comparison of batteries.
45
Chapter 2: Making the Digital Leap

46
Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
Some cameras can use only proprietary batteries —
that is, made by the same manufacturer as your camera.
Thus, you gotta pony up the cash for the ones specially
designed for your camera or risk damaging your camera.
Not good.
Supports
When shooting at slow ISO/ASA speeds, slow shutter
speeds, or in low-light situations, you want to support the
camera to prevent unintentional blur. Your best bet is to
use a tripod or a monopod (see Figure 2-8). (Read more
about film speeds, shutter speeds, and shooting in low
light in Chapters 5 and 6.)
A tripod is a three-legged (hence the tri) stand for your
camera. You attach your camera to it with a tiny screw
attached to a small platform at the top. Tripods can vary
anywhere from high-end ball bearing balanced tools to
ultraportable, tabletop models. A monopod works in a
similar fashion but (obviously) has one leg. (Just watch
out when using a monopod, especially in a public build-
ing. Don’t be surprised if security personnel want to
inspect it. It’s the times we live in.)
Just make sure that your camera has a threaded mount
hole (look at the bottom plate) to marry to a tripod.
Higher-end digital cameras will have this feature. Also,
after you attach your camera to a tripod, you can manipu-
late the tripod’s knobs to flip your camera on its side to
take pictures vertically.
Memory and removable storage media
All digital cameras store exposures in digital memory of
some kind. This “memory” works the way film does in a
traditional camera. Lower-end cameras usually have a set
amount of onboard memory; when it’s full, you’re done
shooting until you download the stored images. (Think of this as running out
of film.) Moderately priced and high-end cameras also use removable media,
which is a fantastic timesaver (no more changing film!) and oh-so-convenient
(just pop in a new card and keep on shooting!).
Figure 2-8: Supports
come in pretty handy.

Funny thing about memory, though (and no, not just that losing it isn’t fun):
Different manufacturers like to use
their own types, or at least different
types, of memory in general. Thus,
removable media formats usually
aren’t exactly interchangeable.
Tangentially, if you download images
from removable media to your com-
puter (as compared with downloading
straight from your camera via a USB
cable), your computer must be able
to accept these memory devices, too.
Some machines come equipped with
card readers on their front (usually
next to the USB ports), and some-
times you need to use an external
card reader (as in Figure 2-9). Sigh.
47
Chapter 2: Making the Digital Leap

Figure 2-9: Download images on removable

From a different angle . . .
Use a tripod’s moveable head (just play with the
mounting base handles) to shoot on an angle and
get some great canted (oblique) shots, as shown
in the figure here. Adjust the tripod’s knobs, twist-
ing and turning them so that they are fixed into
position. Then practice
 Panning left and right: Move the tripod left
and right slowly and methodically.
 Panning up and down: Move the tripod up and
down slowly, then quickly.
 Moving from place to place: Move the tripod
from one place — say, a flat ground — to
another place on uneven ground. Readjust the
legs so it sits evenly.
After you get used to moving the tripod head
around and panning it in all directions, you can set
it up — and adjust it — on the fly and quickly.

48
Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
Here’s the scoop, as briefly as I can write it. Check your particular camera
model/manufacturer to see what you need. Of course, the greater the memory
the card can hold (say 1GB versus 512MB), the more shots you can take on that
card and thus not have to swap it out or cease photographing. Likewise, the
price will be higher.
Here are the major players. Prices change like crazy, so shop online for the best
deals. Too, all these types (with the exception of the mini-CD) come in various
amounts of storage — some as high as 8GB (yes, I did say 8 gigabytes) — so
that factors in to the pricing, too.
 Floppy disk: Yes, believe it or not, at least one type of digital camera (a
Sony Mavica model) records to a 31⁄2" floppy disk. This storage method
is rare.
 Compact CD: Some Sony Mavica models use a compact CD-R/RW stor-
age method. These are rare, too.
 CompactFlash: This is a common
memory card; see Figure 2-10.
These are physically a little
larger in size than a Memory
Stick (see the following bullet),
and their capacities range from
8MB to 8GB of storage. The two
types of CF cards are
• Type I: These are 3.3mm
thick.
• Type II: These are 5mm
thick.
Cameras with Type I slots
cannot use Type II cards. Cameras with Type II slots can use both Type I
and Type II cards.
CompactFlash cards are generally referred to as CF cards.
 Memory Stick: This is a proprietary format from Sony. These thin and
flat removable memory cards are about the length of your thumb.
Compared with current SD (Secure Digital) and CF cards, the original
MS card is incredibly slow.
Sony uses a smaller card — Memory Stick DUO — in some of its super-
compact Cyber-shot models. A Memory Stick DUO card is half the size
of a regular Memory Stick. You need an adapter to bring the Memory
Stick DUO card up to the size that a Memory Stick slot or card reader
can handle.
 SmartMedia (SM): These cards are smaller than a book of matches and
not as thick as a credit card. Their design can cause incompatibility
issues with cameras made before 2001. Some photog pundits predict the
32MB
16MB
Figure 2-10: Memory card removable media

demise of SM cards because Fuji and Olympus — once the biggest users
of SmartMedia cards — now both use their new xD-Picture Card. (See the
upcoming bullet on that format.) All other camera makers, except Fuji,
Olympus, and Sony (which uses its proprietary Memory Stick), have
gone with Secure Digital (SD).
 MultiMediaCard (MMC): These cards are similar to SD cards (see 
the following bullet) but are less secure and are physically thinner.
A MultiMediaCard can fit into an SD slot, but an SD card can’t fit into
an MMC slot. MMCs are usually compatible with cameras that can
use an SD Card.
 Secure Digital (SD) Card: These cards are probably the most popular
flash memory format for digital cameras and can also be used in other
gadgets like PDAs. SD and MMCs are nearly identical on the outside, but
SD cards are much faster than MMC cards. SD cards have become the
flash memory card of choice for digital cameras because of their small
size and low power consumption. SD Cards hold from 16MB to 2GB.
Because not all cameras that use SD can also use MMC cards, check
your camera’s user manual.
 xD-Picture Card: Man, oh, man! These cards are about the size of a quar-
ter! Olympus and Fuji jointly developed the xD-Picture Card, which boasts
an ultracompact design and storage capacity of up to 8GB. These cards
are compatible with different digital camera brands.
Getting a Digital Image from 
Camera to Computer
After you have some good pictures in your digital camera, the next step is to
transfer the images to your computer. Images captured with a film camera can
be transferred to a computer using a scanner. I discuss scanning in Chapter 3.
When you’re ready to download images to your computer for the first time,
first install your camera software
onto your computer. You then have
two basic methods of transfer:
 From the camera itself: Connect
a USB cable from your camera
to your computer, as shown in
Figure 2-11. On newer comput-
ers, you can find a USB port on
the front of your machine.
(Some super-jiffy machines
have USB ports on their 
keyboards!)
49
Chapter 2: Making the Digital Leap
Figure 2-11: Download images from your
camera to your computer.

50
Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
 From removable memory: Remove the memory card from your camera
and place it in a card reader. These can be external devices that plug into
your computer via a USB cable. (Refer to Figure 2-9.) Some computers
have card readers built in.
Either way, your images are then on your computer, from which you can edit
and tweak away in an image processing program like Photoshop.
Adobe Photoshop is one image editing program that meets the needs of digi-
tal artists. It has been around for a while and has many versions. Although
the latest version (CS2) has the most features, almost any version from 3.x up
will do. You can open your downloaded or scanned images into any version
of Photoshop.
You can get a reasonable print from processing your image using other third-
party image manipulation software. iPhoto (for you Mac users out there) and
even your scanner software are enough to print out any image. The key here
is to tweak your printer software to get the best print possible. See Chapter 17
for more about printing from programs other than Photoshop.
As a timesaver, you can bypass the whole download-to-your-computer
path: Just directly download images
from a camera to a printer. You
can use
 A docking system (like from
Kodak), in which the camera
seats directly onto a printer
designed to marry with that
camera model.
 PictBridge, which is a standard
that you can use (in tandem
with a USB cable) to directly
connect camera to printer. (See
Figure 2-12.) Many major manu-
facturers support this technol-
ogy, including Nikon, Canon,
Olympus, Kodak, Pentax, Fuji,
HP, Epson, Sony, and a gaggle of
others. You can read more
about it at
www.cipa.jp/pictbridge/index_e.html
The downside to taking a direct download-to-print shortcut is that you miss
the opportunity to tweak your shots in an image editing program. For more
on printing, see Chapter 17.
Figure 2-12: Download images from your
camera to your printer.

Resolving Resolution Issues
As I mention earlier in this chapter, megapixels determine the quality (clarity)
of a digital image that’s taken with a sensor in a digital camera. A pixel is the
composition unit of a digital image. Remember that a pixel is the smallest unit
in an image on a display screen. Images that you take with your digital camera
have a lot of pixels. For more information about interpolation, resampling,
cropping, and resizing, see Chapter 16.
To view what a pixel looks like within an image
1. Find and double-click an image file on your computer.
2. In Photoshop, enter a magnification level in the Zoom text box at the
lower left of the window (see Figure 2-13).
3. Input the following magnification levels: 50%, 100%, 400%, and 1600%
(the maximum in Photoshop).
No need to type the percent sign; just entering the number will do.
4. Notice how the image changes each time.
Figure 2-13: You can see the pixel squares in the picture enlarged 1600%.
Notice how an image is clear at low magnification levels. Then the tiny squares
that make up the image really take on a life force of their own at high magnifi-
cation levels (as shown in Figure 2-13). The tiny squares are pixels.

Chapter 2: Making the Digital Leap

Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
Figure 2-13 probably could be an art photo in and of itself, which is what
makes the digital platform a medium that has just begun to see its potential
in new art forms.
Whether you take a picture with a digital camera or you take one on film and
digitize it, one of your primary concerns in art photography is to maintain
image resolution. In order to keep the resolution (that’s the number of pixels
your image contains) of your printed photo high above 300 pixels per inch,
strive for the following:
 When taking photographs with your digital camera, set it to a high res-
olution photo by navigating within your camera’s menu in the LCD
screen to the image type/size (varies with camera) you want to shoot.
 When scanning prints, negatives, or positives, set the scanner to read
at least 300 dots per inch (dpi) at your desired final print size.
 For art photos, input an image size of at least 300 ppi (pixels per inch)
in your image processing program before saving.
Understanding File Types
You need to know a few things about what kind of file formats your digital
camera will capture and how they travel from your digital camera to your image
editing software to your printer. The main players are JPEG, TIFF, and Raw.
JPEG
You’ve probably already heard of JPEGs because they’re used on the Internet
and for e-mailing images. (JPEG stands for the Joint Photographic Expert Group.)
If you’ve downloaded digital photos from your camera to your computer and
saved them, you’ve probably seen the file extension .jpg. JPEGs have their
pluses and minuses:
 Pros
• Good for sending images over the Web.
• Easily compressed; can be saved as small files onto your hard drive.
 Cons
• Degrade (lose image quality) each time they’re compressed and
transferred. Compression reduces the file size at the expense of
discarding information about the image itself. Think of it like read-
ing the Cliff’s Notes for Dickens’s David Copperfield. Yeah, you get
the gist, but the nuances fade away.
• Not the best format for printing gallery-quality prints.

The higher-resolution JPEG format is fine for sending images to editors of
newspapers for publication as long as the images haven’t been compressed
(opened and saved in an image processing program) multiple times. 
If you must use the JPEG file format and you want to maintain the highest
image quality possible, always use the maximum Quality setting on your
camera and in your software.
TIFF
The file from which you produce your output is a TIFF file. TIFF means Tagged
Image File Format, which is a format that can be read on both Macs and PCs.
 You produce a TIFF file in a graphics or photo editing program like
Photoshop.
 TIFF files cannot be viewed in Web browsers or on the Internet, but
the file format does an excellent job of preserving image quality.
Raw
On many midrange and high-end digital cameras, you can save photos in Raw
format instead of the traditional JPEG. If you’ve noticed that your camera has
this capability, use it. Here’s why: A Raw image is like a digital negative —
the unprocessed image data that your camera sensor captures. Raw isn’t an
acronym; it just means that the image file itself is unadulterated — that is, it’s
in a raw state. This untouched (um, raw) state is optimal because you can do
your own processing later on your computer.
Different camera manufacturers use different file formats for their own versions
of Raw. For example, you might see such file extensions as .nef (Nikon), .crw
and .cr2 (Canon), .mrw (Minolta), .raf (Fujifilm), .orf (Olympus), .srf
(Sony), and the less-common .x3f (Sigma and Polaroid) and .mos (Leaf).
When you save a Raw file, the camera creates a header file containing all the
camera settings, including (depending on the camera) date/time captured,
the camera used, exposure, ISO, lens, aperture, flash (if any), sharpening level,
contrast and saturation settings, color temperature/white balance, and so on —
in total, the metadata. When you then tweak a copy of your original Raw file,
and process copies, you always leave the original image intact. Very cool. To
top that, many camera settings (such as white balance and color adjustments)
captured in a Raw file can be undone via special software. Think about that —
that’s like getting to return to the scene of your shoot and tweak the camera’s
settings! Time warp!
53
Chapter 2: Making the Digital Leap

54
Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
Okay, okay. Nothing’s perfect. The downside to Raw is that Raw formats differ
between camera manufacturers and even between cameras from the same man-
ufacturer. Thus, you have to use proprietary software from that company or
an image editing program such as Photoshop or Photoshop Elements. And
because Raw files inherently contain more data, they take longer to open and
process than a JPEG or a TIFF file.
The Adobe Web site (www.adobe.com) has the software plug-ins to open
your camera’s Raw files in Photoshop or Photoshop Elements for editing
and adjustment.
Still, the creative possibilities are very tempting. And, more and more third-
party editing and software programs are becoming Raw-compatible with more
and more camera models and brands.
 Digital cameras generate Raw files. These files are read by the software
from the company that you bought your camera from or by an image
editing program.
 Each camera processes Raw files differently. The software to read and
convert Raw files to the standard high-resolution TIFF or PSD format is
available from the camera manufacturer that produced the format; you
need that software to download the files from your camera to your 
computer. Programs like iPhoto are able to read some models’ Raw
format. There’s also third-party software (such as that available at
www.iview-mutimedia.com) that can read most camera’s Raw formats.
 Raw files are generally the preferred file type for producing an art
photograph with a digital camera. The reason for this is that they can
be adjusted for color and tonality more efficiently and with better results
than can JPEG or TIFF files.
Only some types of digital cameras have this setting (can capture Raw files)
because it is very memory intensive. Look for file formats in the camera’s
specifications and see whether Raw is listed. You’ll pay more for cameras
that have this format, but prices are falling rapidly.
That’s all you need to know about files for producing art photography. There
are only three file formats you have to be familiar with when processing images:
JPEG, TIFF, and Raw.

onsider an analogy to illustrate moving a photo file from your scanner
or digital camera to your printer. Take your average-size image on the
Internet — say, one of those beautiful images that AOL flashes on its welcome
page. Those pictures, usually small in size and crystal clear, have been moved
from one place to another. For example, they were either scanned from film
or taken at low resolution with a digital camera and then moved to a
personal computer, a server, or Web space.
Now imagine that you could physically carry the image
from one platform to another. No cords or wireless wave-
lengths to travel through, just moved with your bare
hands. Imagine that an image off the Internet would be
easy to carry, weighing no more than a cup of coffee.
Comparatively, if you take the average size of a digital
rendering or photograph taken with a digital camera
or scanned from film and put into a computer or
server, you’d have to be Hercules (or Wonder Woman)
to transport it from platform to platform because its
weight might approach that of an elephant. You’d either
have to have supernatural powers or a crane.
The point of this analogy: Big, heavy objects require extra might to
handle them. The same reasoning follows for small and large images that go
from one place to another. Handling a small image that travels a short distance
(say, from a camera to a computer or server) takes care but requires much
less power and manipulation than moving a huge image from a camera to a
computer and then to a printer — a long way.

56
Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
The point is that although good images are big, they need lots of power from
your computer to be processed. If you’re considering purchasing a new PC,
make sure that it’s powerful. Chapter 2 provides an overview of digital cam-
eras and peripherals. In this chapter, I discuss computers, monitors, printers,
and scanners — the other equipment necessary for digital art photography.
Exploring Your Computer
If you’re new to digital cameras and digital imaging, take a moment to explore
your computer’s relationship with your digital camera and your scanner. In this
section, you discover the basics of storage, get an overview of monitors, and
read about which platform to use (Mac or Windows — the age-old argument),
all tied together with a discussion of when to upgrade. Unfortunately, I can
give only a smattering of the information regarding these topics within the
confines of this book. For further reading, try Macs For Dummies, Eighth
Edition, by David Pogue, and PCs All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies,
Third Edition, by Mark L. Chambers (both by Wiley).
Storage space
Storage space is of paramount importance to anyone manipulating graphics
on a computer. In short, you need a lot of space and a lot of memory to move,
edit, and print your photos. Certain components of your computer deal with
these issues, and you must be familiar with them. Think of each component
of your computer — described in the following bullets — in terms of storage
space utilization (and conservation, also).
 Disk drive: This can be external or internal.
• Internal disk drives are hard drives, which are part of the total 
package when you buy a desktop or laptop computer. Look for
a computer with at least 80 gigabytes (GB) of hard drive space.
A clear, gallery-worthy 8" x 10" image uses somewhere around
20 megabytes (MB) of computer storage space. Some pieces of
this size, like black-and-white photos, can use as little as 5MB, and
others that contain intense color can use more than 100MB.
• External disk drives are a great way to add more memory to your
computer. At 160GB — considered a smaller size — a drive like that
shown in Figure 3-1 can do the trick of keeping thousands of high-
resolution photos. And if one external drive doesn’t do the trick,
you can get more than one; at just a little over $100, the price is
right for these workhorses. If you’re a professional digital photog-
rapher, you need one of these eventually no matter how large a hard
drive came with your machine. You can get external hard drives
online (I recommend www.seagate.com or www.lacie.com) in a
variety of sizes from 80GB to over 400GB.

Figure 3-1: Use an external hard drive for extra storage.
Connect your external hard drive to your computer with a FireWire
or USB 2.0 cable (not a USB cable) because these ports transfer
data much faster. FireWire and USB are two types of connections
that both Macs and PCs use to connect devices. The FireWire and
USB 2.0 devices transfer data at over 400 Mbps (megabytes per
second, a unit of measurement used for describing the speed at
which data transfers), almost 30 times faster than a USB cable.
• CD and/or DVD drives enable you to store extra images on CDs or
DVDs. The different types of CDs and DVDs are mostly distinguished
by whether you can reuse them. The capacity of the discs ranges
from a CR-R or CD-RW (approximately 650MB) to a dual-sided DVD-
RAM (a read/write DVD that holds close to 10GB). The discs are
ideal for making hard copies to carry around with you or to send
back and forth via snail (ground) mail.
 Random access memory (RAM): This is the computer’s memory that is
available for programs to use — to move, edit, save, and print files. Digital
photography is a memory-eater: Pictures downloaded onto your computer
use up a lot of memory on your machine while being edited or adjusted.
No amount of RAM is too much if you have a choice of models of com-
puters that you’re shopping for — go with the higher number. RAM gets
used up with each program you open and each time you have your com-
puter process an image with the tools in an image processing program
like Photoshop.
Computers sold even a couple years ago didn’t come furnished with as much
hard drive space as those sold today. The older your computer, the faster
you’ll run out of space without upgrading the storage space that came with
it when you bought it.
Look out for messages that your computer gives you while you’re dumping
images onto it, such as Cannot copy X to Y because there is not
enough free space; this message tells you that the disk you’re transferring
files to is full. While dealing with large images, Scratch disk is full or
57
Chapter 3: Your Digital Technology

58
Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
Not enough memory appears onscreen, telling you that you’ve run out of
RAM. You also don’t want to hear a grinding hard drive or endure that certain
sluggishness that leaves you staring out a window, wondering whether you
made your image so big that your computer has the hiccups.
You can help tell the status of your computer by listening to it and watching
your monitor:
 Listen to the fan and the spinning of the hard drive. A quiet humming
sound is best.
 See how quickly files open. When you have sufficient RAM and your
computer is well maintained, files don’t lag when opening.
If you have a new computer that you haven’t overloaded with software and
files from the Internet, you’re off to a great start for image processing. If your
system is a bit cluttered, you’ll find that moving and manipulating images is a
slow process. Clean your system to free some space:
 Throw stuff away that you’ve created and don’t use. You can get rid of
files that you don’t use by right-clicking (Control+clicking on a Mac) and
depositing them into the Recycle Bin (Windows)/Trash (Mac). Be careful,
though, because you don’t want to dump files that your computer needs to
run. Stick with dumping old documents and images that you’ve created or
duplicated and that you don’t need or use anymore. Or, if you’re a packrat,
copy them onto your external hard drive or burn them onto a CD/DVD.
 Empty your trash. Sounds obvious, but dumping files you don’t need
is a two-step process. First you put them in the trash; then you empty it.
(Files in the trash are still recognized by your hard drive; you have to
empty your trash for those files to be really gone.) On the Mac, you click
the Trash icon and choose Empty. In Windows, right-click the desktop
icon and choose Empty Recycle Bin.
 Empty temporary Internet files. Open your browser and navigate to the
location where it stores temporary files or to the cache and delete them.
In Internet Explorer, choose Tools➪Internet Options and then click the
Delete Files button on the General Tab. In Safari (Mac), choose Safari➪
Empty Cache.
 Maintain your system by using its maintenance utilities. In Windows,
run the Disk Cleanup and/or Disk Defragmenter, which are both part of
System Tools, and just follow the prompts. In Mac OS X, navigate to
Applications➪Utilities and run Disk Utility by selecting your hard drive
and clicking Repair Disk Permissions, which corrects files by repairing
how they are accessed. (Permissions to reach files can get corrupted
over time, causing your computer to slow down.)

Monitors
The monitor shut off.
It wouldn’t blink and couldn’t link.
Then it gleamed like the Big Dipper.
Its light flickered as it started to get chipper.
— “Shut Down the Computer, Roxanne” by Matt Bamberg
Your monitor is your window to what you see, in close detail. In order for an
image to be successfully rendered (that is, for the pixels to be arranged to
create a picture), you need to see the details. The only way that you can see
the details clearly is with a good, high-resolution LCD flat-panel monitor from
a well-known company:
 Apple: apple.com/displays. Displays start at $799, including a 30-inch
display for about $3,000.
 Sony: www.sonystyle.com. A 17" flat-panel monitor is available for
about $700.
Prices change quickly, so visit Web sites when you decide to buy.
Flat-panel monitors (as shown in Figure 3-2) are best. And the bigger, the
better. Compared with traditional CRT (cathode ray tube) screens (the ones
that look like a TV from the ’80s), they don’t blink much or flicker. LCD flat-
panel monitors also possess a native resolution. Unlike CRT screens, whose
resolution stays the same no matter what size you set it to (size being the
number of pixels you see onscreen), LCD resolution has a value in which
the screen you’re gazing at is clearest. Each monitor size contains a pixel 
configuration for the native resolution. The configuration for a 15" screen is
1024 x 768 pixels; and 1280 x 1024 or 1400 x 1050 for a 17", 18", or 19" model.
The advantages of a big, flat-panel monitor are
 Images don’t get distorted with screen curvatures.
 Bigger monitors give you more room to move around windows.
 When moved or shaken, you don’t get any flickering.

Figure 3-2: Flat-panel monitors are perfect for graphics work.
A big, flat-panel monitor is essential for graphics work, but you also need to
decide what specifications are best for the type of graphics work you’re going
to do. What you see isn’t necessarily what you get. Brightness is distributed
across the intensity spectrum (how much contrast you have) of your monitor
or the gamma value (the value of color perception output from the voltage of
the input to the monitor). The differences in gamma between a PC and a Mac
can have an effect on the colors you see in your photograph.
The platform that you use — Mac or PC — affects the image you see on your
monitor, making it even more important that what you see on your monitor is
as clear as you can get. That way, you know what to tweak to make your pic-
ture prints the best that they can be. Monitors do act differently on different
platforms. You might notice that an image shown on a monitor connected to
a PC is darker than one connected to a Mac. You can read more about platform
differences in the upcoming section, “Choosing a platform.”

Calibration
Thank goodness that the days of blinking monitors are just about over with the
advent of the new flat-panel monitors. However, you still might have to calibrate
your monitor, which involves first assessing your computer’s color management
system and then making some tweaks so that the colors you see onscreen are
as close as possible to what you see in print. Because your monitor is what you
see — the king (or queen) of communication in the technology world — you
need to make sure that it jibes with where your photo has come from and
where it’s going. The images shown in Figure 3-3 simulate what I mean.
Figure 3-3: Left: Image on a well-calibrated monitor; right: not an optimal image.
Think output — that is, what comes out of your printer — from the very
beginning of the digitizing process, when you put your image into a com-
puter. Whether you’re calibrating your monitor on a Mac or a PC, this
upfront work gives you superior quality prints.
Calibrating your monitor requires that you tweak it to work with your image
processing program. The process is color management, or matching the color
in the image as it’s displayed with the color you see in your scanner, on your
monitor, and in print.
If you have trouble setting up a color management system for your platform —
or if you simply can’t determine whether you need to calibrate your monitor —
type “color management” and the name of your platform into a search
engine and look for the latest tutorial. (As with anything on the Internet, how-
ever, sometimes information presented there is not accurate or current, so
use caution.) The best Web sites for this type of information are the compa-
nies that make your product. I recommend the following site for some general
information:

Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
The Mac’s Apple Display Calibrator Assistant can be used to calibrate your
monitor in a few easy steps. Note that Mac OS X screens will look a bit different
from version to version (10.2, 10.3, and 10.4), but they basically function the
same. Note: Right out of the box, however, most Apple LCDs work just fine and
require no calibration. Open your Mac’s System Preferences, click Displays, and
choose Adobe RGB as the color space from the Color panel. If you see unusual
color reproduction onscreen, you might want to calibrate the monitor.
Go-getter graphics add-ons
Other items to consider when you’re souping up your computer for graphics
work include the following:
 Card readers: These handy little devices can be connected to your 
computer with a USB or FireWire cable to directly read the memory
cards that you extract from your digital camera. Usually, you have to
have your digital camera’s software read what’s in your camera after
it’s connected. (For more about these devices, see Chapter 2.)
 Graphics card: All modern computers include a card that processes the
video data and sends it to your monitor. A more powerful card can help
your computer speed the redraw of the monitor screen, which helps you
work faster and more efficiently.
 External hard drive: No amount of hard drive space could be enough
when working with a lot of high-resolution photographs. I discuss this in
the earlier section, “Storage space.”
 Mouse: To make your Mac behave more like a PC, you can replace your
one-button mouse with a multibutton mouse. When you do, right-clicking
is the same as Control+clicking with a one-button mouse. Scroll wheels
also help you navigate the screen.
 Graphics tablet: A graphics tablet is like a drawing pad for your com-
puter (see Figure 3-4). No more
crimping up your wrist trying
to get a smooth hand-drawn
line into your Photoshop docu-
ment. The tablet comes with a
stylus that you draw with. (The
tablet is connected to your
computer.) In Bonus Chapter 2
(at www.dummies.com), I create
text out of a VW Bug image,
an activity where using a graph-
ics tablet would be especially
helpful.
Figure 3-4: Graphics tablets are easier to draw
with than a mouse.

Choosing a platform
When you go shopping for a new computer, look for the best platform in
terms of ease of use for yourself. If you’ve been working in a Windows envi-
ronment for most of your life and know it well — meaning you know how to
troubleshoot, combat viruses, and maintain your Windows system — then
stick with it. Just because you’re going deeper into digital photography doesn’t
mean that you have to switch platforms, even if most people say that Macs
are better suited for graphics work.
If you’ve never used a computer before, you probably can go with either 
platform. You’ll hear the Mac-is-better-for-graphics argument, but PCs and
Windows have come a long way in upgrading their graphics capabilities.
Older computers (Mac systems with OS 9 and Windows 98) and earlier ver-
sions of Photoshop that work on less-powerful computers can produce almost
the same results as the most recent version of Photoshop and an upgraded
computer. However, newer versions and machines are faster and offer more
advanced features. You might also find that older computers are incapable of
working with the larger file sizes produced by more advanced digital cameras.
Upgrading your platform
Your computer needs some get-up-and-go to run any graphics intensive 
program — and high-resolution photographs are the most demanding form
of 2-D graphics (the most intensive graphics that exist, except for digital
video and 3-D graphics). That is, at high resolutions, photographs need a lot
of space within your computer and a lot of random access memory (RAM) to
manipulate them.
After you do your housekeeping chores, adding more RAM (see the “Storage
space” section, earlier in this chapter) to your computer can help it run more
smoothly. You can order additional memory, which looks like long wafers,
from your favorite neighborhood computer store (or online).
First determine how much memory you have, how much more you can add,
and what type of RAM it is.
In Mac OS X:
1. Click the Ú menu (in the upper-left corner of the Desktop) and choose
About This Mac.
2. Click More Info to see how many empty slots you have (in the Memory
Overview area on the System Profile tab).
3. Write down the memory type that you find.
63
Chapter 3: Your Digital Technology

64
Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
In Windows, consult the type of memory for the machine you have by looking
at the manual or go to your computer manufacturer’s Web site.
Adding more memory is just a matter of opening
up your box and snapping memory chips into the
empty RAM slots. (Think of pushing an ink car-
tridge into a printer.) If you have an older machine,
it’s probably not a bad idea to fill up all the empty
memory slots.
Always first unplug the machine and ground your-
self before touching the chassis of your computer
so you don’t send an electric shock through the
computer and yourself. Ground yourself by touch-
ing something metal before handling the memory
or the computer, or by wearing an antistatic wrist
strap (see Figure 3-5) while snapping the RAM
into place.
Realizing the PC’s improved graphics capabilities
Because the computer-connection world (for the most part) works via USB
and/or FireWire ports (connections that work on both platforms), you can
use the same external hard drives described in the Mac section for your PC.
The two types of USB products are 1.1 and 2.0. The newer, 2.0, is a much faster
connection, as fast or faster than a FireWire (both have tested to transmit
data at speeds at or over 400 Mbps). When you plug a USB 2.0 device into a
USB port, you can expect USB speeds of up to 12 Mbps. Likewise, plugging
a USB device into a USB 2.0 port won’t speed up the data transfer rate.
Here are other things that make your graphics programs and image process-
ing work go faster and smoother on a PC:
 Get more RAM. Get lots — as much as you can afford. On a PC, Photoshop
runs slowly when you’re working with high-resolution photos if you don’t
have enough RAM.
 Consider getting a workstation. Workstations — computers designed to
handle high-resolution graphics — have come down in price (some down
to around $1,000) and offer all the high-end graphics card and memory
capabilities of a souped-up PC. Dell and Hewlett-Packard (HP) offer these
systems, once used only by graphic designers and engineers.

PCs are definitely catching up with Macs in terms of exceptional graphics.
New systems come with great graphic cards that make their displays compa-
rable with a Mac. If you have an older PC, certainly upgrade your graphics
card for better performance and speed from image processing programs.
(If you’re a video game addict, you know exactly what I mean.) Here are
some key points to keep in mind:
 AGP: Your computer has to have an Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP)
connector. (To look for accelerated graphics devices on a PC, choose
Start➪Programs➪Accessories➪System Tools➪System Information;
under Components, click Display.)
 RAM: Get at least 128MB of memory on the video card for the best shad-
ows, highlights, tones, and colors in your display.
 Graphics card: nVIDIA (www.nvidia.com), ATI (www.ati.com), or Matrox
(www.matrox.com) graphics cards are the most efficient — that is, they
give you speed and stability when you work in Photoshop.
An 8X graphics card (the data transfer speed) is good. Because Photoshop
isn’t a 3-D game, though, 4X will do just fine. A 4X card will save you
over $100.

Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
Choosing a Printer and Paper 
for the Results You Want
Ahh, printers. When you finally get to the step where you actually print some-
thing out, that’s an achievement. Pat yourself on the back.
In order to understand printers, you have to understand the files from which
a print originates. You can print out straight from your digital camera, but
the prints you get probably won’t be gallery-worthy because you haven’t
had the opportunity to adjust the image’s color, composition, and content.
Transforming a high-resolution photograph to a gallery-worthy print means
that you print from an image processing program, like Photoshop.
If you’re wondering what Photoshop (or another image processing program)
has to do with buying a printer, try to fill a swimming pool with a hose that’s
the width of a straw. That’s right — you don’t want to spare pixels and resolu-
tion by buying a printer that sputters out pixels here and there. Just as you
would want to use a normal-sized garden hose to fill your swimming pool, you
want a printer that uses as much of the data coming from your computer as
possible and covers your paper with breathtaking color or well-contrasted
shades of gray (for a black-and-white photo).
Software such as Photoshop and Photoshop Elements allows you to make
your images any size from tiny, high-resolution prints to huge grainy blow-
ups that look like they came from Marilyn Monroe’s old family photos.
(See Parts III and IV for more about image editing and printing.)
Finding a printer that’s right for your work
Gathering information about the different types of printers available is a big
help in understanding your choices in the world of printers. Educate yourself
by talking with others in your situation and by doing a little research:
 Talk with other artists. Go to art shows and street fairs, look at folks’
digital art, and ask what type of printer they use. If you like the look they
present, you might have found the perfect printer. Conversely, if you
don’t like their quality, you can eliminate that printer from your list.
 Research. Read printer reviews at sites like PC World, Macworld, and
Infoworld online magazines.
The following list highlights those issues you should be most concerned with
when printer shopping:

 Printer resolution: A measurement of the detail of the printed photo-
graph, this resolution is different from computer screen resolution and is
measured in dots per inch (dpi). The lower the dpi your printer prints at,
the less clear your prints will be. However, any printer rated at 1440 dpi
or higher is sufficient.
 Paper types: You have literally dozens of papers to choose from — from
glossy to matte and fine art. See Table 3-2 (later in this chapter) for a quick
comparison of paper types.
 Print speed: Any art photo that’s of gallery quality — that is, has a high
resolution — will take at least a few minutes to print out. If you want
high quality, you have to be patient.
 Print quality: Epson products hold up pretty well in terms of the ink
that’s sprayed on the paper. Mid-level HP glossy prints don’t do as well.
(I’ve had some of mine for a few years, and much fading has occurred on
those that were printed on HP glossy paper on a Photosmart 1215 printer.)
Look for the term archival when shopping for a printer so that you know
your prints will last for decades.
Most high-end Epson printer models require that you switch between
two different shaded black ink cartridges when you print on different
papers. You have to change your ink cartridge depending on the paper
you use. Matte black ink is used for matte paper, and photo black ink is
used for glossy papers.
Different printers use different colors to closely match the colors of your com-
puter screen. Printer software converts whatever colors you use in your photo
editing program to CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) format. CMYK is one
of a few color systems used by printers for creating color in your print. An
Epson 2200 printer, for example, takes seven cartridges of the following colors
that fit within the CMYK mold: matte or photo black, light black, cyan, light
cyan, magenta, light magenta, and yellow. Remember, however, that your digi-
tal image remains in the RGB (red, green, blue) color mode — let the printer’s
software convert to CMYK (or CcMmYKk in the case of a seven-ink printer).
Generally speaking, the more ink cartridges your printer has, the better varie-
gation in tone and color your print will have.
For the purposes of printing art photography on a variety of papers, you’ll
be working mostly in RGB mode. Another common mode in Photoshop is the
CMYK mode, which is what printing presses use. In this mode, many colors in
Photoshop become out of gamut, which means you can’t see them in print if
you don’t change them to colors readable in that mode. You don’t use CMYK
color mode with inkjet printers.
67
Chapter 3: Your Digital Technology

68
Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
Several types of printers currently on the market are suitable for art 
photography:
 Inkjet: Inkjet printers (see Fig-
ure 3-6) spray ink onto paper
using replaceable cartridges.
They are great for economical
prints. An 8" x 10" print costs a
dollar or two (depending on the
type of paper used). Despite
their slowness (perhaps several
minutes to print a 5" x 7" at a
high resolution), inkjet printers
have become the number-one
choice for the art photographer
(like yourself). Produced by a
number of different computer and printer companies, they vary in price
($100–$8,000). You can spend a pittance for one that uses a single combo
ink cartridge or a lot for one that uses many individual ink cartridges.
(The printers with 44"-wide printing capabilities with special inks are
the pricey ones.)
Everything you want to know about inkjet printers is at the http://
inkjetart.com moderated forum page. You can also find some very good
prices/deals on ink cartridges here, too.
 Color laser: A laser printer
(shown in Figure 3-7) uses static
electricity to make an image on
a drum covered with toner (a
solid black/different colored
powder), which then prints the
image onto paper using heated
rollers that melt the toner onto
the paper. Color laser printers
are good for creating charts and
other graphics but not for print-
ing art photography. Perhaps
the technology will develop
some day to make these print-
ers produce photography that’s
comparable with that produced
in a darkroom. Prices for the
printers range from $400 to
$2,000, varying mostly with print
speed. The cost per-page of less
than a quarter makes a color
laser printer great for printing out fliers, but the inferior quality com-
pared with an inkjet makes it a no-go for art photos.
Figure 3-6: Inkjet printers are affordable.
Figure 3-7: Color laser printers aren’t your best
option.

 Snapshot: Snapshot printers are mini models that print fast (prints made in
about a minute) at home or on the road. However, you can’t make images
larger than 4" x 6" with them. Too, your prints end up being more expen-
sive than those you can get at the drug store from the photo guy. Prices
range from $100 to $300. These printers, capable of producing high-quality
photographs, can be used to make art photos by setting up a kiosk to
take and print photos of people, say, sticking their heads on top of the
bodies of hula-dancers, and then selling them at a fair. Models (all print-
ing at 4" x 6") include Kodak’s EasyShare Printer Dock dye-sublimation
(about 62 cents per print), and Epson’s PictureMate (about 29 cents per
photo). Figure 3-8 shows examples of three models of snapshot printers.
Figure 3-8: Snapshot printers.
 Dye-sublimation: Also called thermal dye trans-
fer printers, dye-sub printers (see Figure 3-9)
use heated ribbons to imprint an image onto
specially coated paper with the resulting
print looking just a like a darkroom-produced
photograph.
What’s the verdict in terms of choosing a printer?
Probably some kind of inkjet would be your best
bet. Check out Table 3-1 for a handy comparison

Many entry-level professional digital photographers print with the Epson
Stylus Photo 2200 inkjet printer, which can produce gallery-quality prints.
Available online from Epson (www.epson.com), this one will set you back
about $700. That’s not a bad price for a printer that uses seven ink cartridges
and prints at resolutions of 2880 dpi, leaving you with knock-your-socks-off
art photos. This model produces prints as big as 13" x 19". If you attach the
printer to its roll feed (it comes with the printer) and roll paper (you have
to buy that extra), you can print out a maximum print of 13" x 44" inches.
The Epson Stylus Photo R1800 model uses eight inks, can print 13" wide,
and produces archival prints with a lifespan over 100 years — all for $549!
Good-quality prints will have your printer drinking ink like a runner drinks
water after he’s just finished a marathon. Make sure to keep extra ink car-
tridges on hand!
Paper and friends: Selecting the 
best medium for your prints
Kodak, Fuji, HP, Epson, and even Office Depot make and sell their own photo-
graphic print paper. Some printers can handle any kind of paper, producing
good-quality prints that you can sell. Others produce superior quality prints that
your friends and customers will be in awe of, exclaiming, “How’d you do that?!”
You can choose from a variety of media on which to print your art: all kinds of
paper, acetate, and even canvas. (Epson offers its PremierArt Water Resistant
Canvas to print your photos with certain printers.)
For printing your art on paper, you have a wealth of options (see Table 3-2 for
a quick-and-dirty comparison). Paper comes in a number of varieties: ultra-
premium glossy, enhanced matte, velvet fine art, and so on. What you use
depends upon the type of art you want to create:

 Any paper is fine as long as it’s inexpensive. Cost is important, especially
if you’re on a budget and/or want to keep your expenses down. If you want
to sell a lot of prints and you plan to do your own framing, you don’t need
the artsy velvet stuff. Enhanced matte or premium glossy works just fine.
Many papers are arranged by thickness. For example, HP glossy papers are
categorized by Ultra Premium (the thickest), Premium (next thickness),
and so on. 81⁄2" x 11" HP paper runs about a dollar a sheet for the Ultra
Premium Glossy, the paper that looks most like a photograph. Epson
enhanced matte paper produces a stellar print that among some circles
has been considered archival. (At any rate, the print will last at least a
couple of decades behind glass.) The paper under glass looks mediocre
and much less thrilling than HP glossy paper. Set an Epson matte print
inside a glass frame and it looks super, while the HP glossy looks great
outside the frame but picks up glare behind glass.
 Your paper choice is your first shot at getting into a gallery. Epson’s
enhanced matte is still a fine choice for a show or for a presentation in
a gallery. Although the fine glossies look good, they still don’t have the
ability to take to the ink as a matte paper does when it’s applied with an
inkjet printer.

Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
Consider these points regarding your choice between glossy and matte paper
prints printed on an inkjet printer:
 Glossy paper looks great but is inferior to matte paper in print quality.
The highest-quality glossy papers that HP, Kodak, and other companies
offer are thick. And some brands do have a tendency to roll. HP machines
do well with many brands of paper. Higher-quality glossy paper is about
a dollar per sheet.
 Glossy paper looks better than matte paper — or does it? That great
glossy print is what photography is all about, right? Well, yes, no, and
maybe. An inkjet print on glossy paper behind glass can display bother-
some glare on an image in direct light.
 Matte paper fed into wide-format, high-end printers has superior print
quality. I recommend using the paper produced by your printer’s manu-
facturer (rather than paper from other paper makers). Other paper
might be cheaper, but you probably won’t get as good a print, and you
could be spelling disaster in the form of clogged ink cartridges and wasted
paper. Enhanced matte runs about 50 cents per sheet for 81⁄2" x 11" to a
dollar and more for 13" x 19".
 The newer inks don’t fade on some matte paper. In fact, the paper
degrades over time faster than the ink fades. Note: I’m talking decades
here, especially with paper and ink behind UV-coated glass.
 You want to set product pricing to be profitable. A print on velvet fine
art paper commands more money than one on enhanced matte paper.
However, both print types will last a very long time and give outstanding
digital prints, which is why both papers would be accepted as saleable
items at galleries and consignment stores.
Finding the right image size for your print
The size of your image that you should make all depends on how powerful your
equipment is. If you want to dabble in producing your own framed prints, start
small — say, produce 5" x 7" prints. This is a good starting size because it’s a
little bigger than the prints produced by a drug store’s film processing machine.
The most common size prints are 4" x 6", 5" x 7", 8" x 10", 11" x 14", 11" x 17",
and 13" x 19" inches. Of course, you could opt for smaller or larger, the latter
dependent on your printer’s maximum printout size. These standard sizes
work well because
 People are accustomed to these standard print sizes used in film 
photography.
 You can easily find premade frames for these standard sizes.
 Smaller size images (4" x 6", 5" x 7", and 8" x 10") can be printed on 
81⁄2" x 11" paper, which is the size of paper most printer companies
make for printing on their printers.

Exploring the Ins and Outs of Scanners
Flatbed scanners — the type that you use to scan prints, negatives, or slides
(positives) — are the devices that bring a nondigital image into the digital
realm. You’re probably familiar with the concept of scanning a hard copy photo
print: Just like using your everyday copy machine, you lay the image face-down
on a glass plate, close the lid, and press a Copy button. However, instead of
getting another hard copy duplicate, that image is stored digitally on your
computer. You’re not limited to scanning only prints, though. Many scanners
can also scan transparencies — negatives and slides (positives) — as well.
Why would you want to use film instead of buying a digital camera? One,
scanned images’ are still technically digital art because your final product has
been digitized. Two, some galleries don’t accept digital art: They consider any
image printed from a computer to be digital art, even if you started from film.
The main advantage of digitizing film images is that you have a hard copy of
your work. This is important because
 A hard copy can’t be corrupted, like a file on a computer. Hey, life 
happens. Hard drives hiccup and crash. Sure, you can make CD back-
ups of your images’ files, but those won’t last forever, either (ten years,
maybe — depending on how much the CD is used and handled). No one
knows how digital media will perform over long periods of time as a
storage system.
Practice safe print and transparency storage to keep your originals pris-
tine. Dust and scratches are the enemy!
 You can scan these images again and again, each into a new file. Your
creative possibilities are endless, all starting from the same hard copy
original.
Film-processing cost isn’t that big of a back-breaker: Developing
35mm film can be really cheap if you order develop-only (no prints).
(The price to develop 24 images versus also getting prints drops by
more than half: And you still get to know the local photo guy/girl.)
Fortunately, within the realm of digital photography, film still has a role via
the scanner. You can scan prints. Better yet, you can scan negatives. And best
yet, you can scan slides at really high resolution, making the film-digital divide
not a divide at all.
Choosing a scanner
When you go shopping for a scanner, many numbers are thrown at you, with
a variety of prices that are associated with them. In their product specifica-
tions, computer companies refer to scanner power in dots per inch (dpi).
Earlier in this book, you can read about pixels per inch. The difference
between ppi and dpi has to do with image resolution and print resolution.
73
Chapter 3: Your Digital Technology

74
Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
 ppi: ppi has to do with image resolution: Monitors use pixels.
 dpi: dpi has to do with print resolution: Printers use dots.
You can set the resolution of the image that you are importing. The number of
pixels per inch (ppi) is determined by the number of sensors inside the scanner.
For the sharpest color prints that have been scanned, you need a scanner
that creates a print image with more dpi.
 The least expensive scanners have a print resolution of 300 x 300 dpi to
about 2400 x 2400 dpi. The Visioneer One Touch 9220 USB FlatBed scan-
ner is priced at under $100 and includes a negative reader. Not bad for a
machine that scans at 4800 x 2400 dpi. Also, for about $100, you can get
an HP Scanjet 3970 with a negative reader, which scans at 2400 x 2400 dpi.
 The most expensive scanners have print resolutions around 4800 x
9600 dpi. Coming in at the low end of expensive — at near $300 — is
Microtek’s ScanMaker 6100 Pro with a negative reader into which you
can slip negatives up to 4" x 5". (Don’t laugh; I’ve found more than a
couple of these in my old family photos.) Resolution for this workhorse
is 6400 x 3200 dpi. A little over $400 will buy the Epson 4990, which
scans film and/or transparencies up to 8" x 10" at 4800 x 9600 dpi.
Sharpness depends mainly on the quality of the optics used to make the
scanner and the brightness of the light source.
The few pages I have to explore using scanners can’t really do the topic justice.
For more information, I recommend a book dedicated to the subject, such as
Scanners For Dummies, Second Edition, by Mark L. Chambers (Wiley).
Configuring your scanner
After you buy your scanner, you need to do two things:
1. Connect your scanner to your computer using a USB or FireWire device.
(See the earlier section, “Storage space,” where I discuss external hard
drives because scanners use the same connection ports as do other
peripherals.) If your scanner and computer have USB 2.0 or FireWire
ports, use them — they’re much faster than the regular USB.
2. Download the software to run the scanner. Scanner software comes
with a companion CD to download into your computer. You can also
(and should) access the scanner manufacturer’s Web site to download
the software (because it will be more current than the CD in hand), just
in case you misplace your CD or its files become corrupted or outdated.
Read more about scanning in Chapter 12.

Defining Yourself and 
Your Photographs
In This Chapter
 Making age-old creative decisions in your photography
 Identifying interesting photography subjects
 Creating photos that intrigue viewers
 Turning old family photos into art
 Transforming your life experiences into digital art
N
o doubt about it: Photographs are a personal thing. After all, a photo-
graph is a way for you to show the world how you see something —
your perspective. In order for you to create art photos — you know,
images with impact . . . more than the average snapshot — you
have three tasks ahead of you:
 Define yourself as a photographer.
 Define your audience.
 Master your tools and hone your craft.
You have dozens of possibilities at your disposal
to bridge that gap. First, you have to do a little 
introspection — investigate who you are. Then you
move on to identify your audience. Peruse this chap-
ter to help you identify yourself, choose subjects to
express your creativity, and pinpoint those folks who
would be interested in your art.
After you have those parts of the puzzle knocked out, you have to
choose your subject matter. The world that you can catch on your camera is
one very big place. From your immediate surroundings to your neighborhood,

76
Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
your town, your friends, your family, your state, your country, your travels . . .
the list is endless. You have tons of choices as subjects for your digital art
photography.
Finally, read other chapters of this book to find help with the photography
tools, rules, tricks, and tweaks to take your images from average to art.
Defining Yourself as a Photographer
Making art is one of the most rewarding activities that you can pursue
because it’s something you create yourself with your own personal touch.
How personal you want to get is up to you. Some traditional photography
artists have work displayed in modern art museums, brushing the edge in
controversy. For example, Robert Mapplethorpe, in the 1980s, made head-
lines when he used the medium to reflect on the pain of his personal life.
The list of photographers who have taken a personal look at their lives is
long, and there probably isn’t one who didn’t evaluate his or her life to come
up with the subject matter for his photographs. To name but a few, look at
the work of William Eggleston, Annie Leibovitz, David Hockney — and even
moon-walker Neil Armstrong.
So if you’re going to be an art photog-
rapher, should you hang out at cafés
and smoke hand-rolled cigarettes?
Well, not if you don’t want to. (But if
you see someone who’s smoking a
hand-rolled cigarette in a café and
who looks amiable to having his pic-
ture taken, by all means ask him. That
could be an art photo opportunity.)
Perhaps you have no interest in
people or their interactions. This 
certainly doesn’t mean that you can’t
be an art photographer. Take pictures
of what appeals to you visually —
like in Figure 4-1 — to help define
yourself as a photographer. For
example, perhaps you’re drawn to
color (think carnivals, marketplaces
filled with rainbows of fruit, or fields
exploding with poppies). Or maybe
you’re attracted to the shapes and
forms of nature, such as winding
streams, gnarled trees, and majestic
peaks. You get the picture.
Figure 4-1: Capture what interests you.

Shoot what you like
To figure out what type of pictures you take the
most, look at your pictures you’ve taken and sort
them by categories. If you find that you take a
lot of pictures of the same things — say, street
scenes — you’re on your way to finding a subject
that you like (and learning about yourself as a
photographer).
Many well-known photographers choose the
streets of famous cities as the subjects of their
work. If you find that you have a tendency to
shoot a particular subject (like street scenes, as
in Figure 4-2), then by all means, concentrate on
that subject. The more you practice, the better
you’ll get at capturing and finding different ways
to showcase your fave subjects. When you really
know your subject, you can better find niche mar-
kets for your photos, too.
Study the masters
If you find yourself gravitating toward classical
poses and subject matter, study what well-known
artists through the ages chose for their subject
matter.
Notice how the subject matter evolves from cave
men drawings to religious figures and still lifes
(as in Figure 4-3) to nature. The summary of the
subject matter of the history of art ends with
social commentary about the Great Depression.
Art has progressed to modernity through many
evolutions. What comes next is up to you. For
more detailed information about the subject
matter that classical artists have used through-
out the ages, you can look at Art For Dummies, by
Thomas Hoving (Wiley).
After you study the classical masters, take a look
at some photographic masters at www.masters-
of-photography.com. Works from all the biggies
of photography are featured there. Check out
Helen Levitt for some cool 1940s grafitti, Ansel
Adams for the world’s greatest landscapes, Diane Arbus for weird but won-
derful people, and E. J. Bellocq for early 20th-century characters. Throughout
this book, I reference more artists to help you interpret the masters’ photos
and refresh their ideas a bit so you refine your own photographic style.

Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
Right-brain, left-brain
Maybe you’ve heard the phrase, “Oh, he’s a left-brained guy,” or “She’s right-
brained.” Having one part of your brain dominant over the other shouldn’t stop
you from taking good digital pictures. This cognitive tendency will, though,
probably affect the type of subject matter you choose and the perspective
that you choose. It could also affect how you take a picture. Consider right-
and left-brained tendencies in terms of an art photographer.
If you’re left-brained, you’re
 Logical: You can figure out patterns. You’re good with numbers, problem
solving, measuring, and data collecting.
 Analytical: Given a set of circumstances, you can provide the answers.
You like organization and specific details, preferring to know how things
will turn out.
Dadaism
Dadaists (yes, a term that sounds as if a toddler has butchered
an art term) stretched the definition of art into new territories: a
world of the offbeat and bizarre. In 1917, French artist Marcel
Duchamp exhibited a urinal by moving it from a bathroom into a
museum and calling it art.
He called this art because his viewers saw something that they
wouldn’t normally expect. The school of art devoted to everyday,
ready-made, objects was called Dada. Duchamp was a found-
ing member.
Dadaists see everyday surroundings with new eyes, layers of life
that transport new ways of thinking into pieces of art — a roar-
ing of tense colors and a juxtaposition of opposites. Dadaists
often use collages to communicate often complicated and/or
convoluted ideas.
When you take two disparate images and put them together to
spell out a connection, maybe you’ve got some Dada going. For
example, if I decide to go on a diet, I might put something on my
refrigerator (like the photo here) to discourage me from eating.

If you’re right-brained, you’re
 Intuitive: You’re ruled by gut feelings. You can delve into subjective
thinking and make up stories.
 Holistic: You accept randomness and use what’s given to synthesize
something. You like the creative process and can tackle more than two
things at once.
If you’re left-brained, you can assume the following:
 Your photography is more ordered and shot more professionally,
with more and better equip-
ment. If you need a tripod,
you’ll get one. You take more
time shooting. You have more
posed shots and take the oppor-
tunity to use a planned lighting
scheme.
 Your photographs address
technical issues before creative
ones. You probably won’t be
the kind of photographer who
shoots spontaneously. Figure 4-4
shows a posed photo, a nice
photo that was planned and not
spontaneous. 
If you’re right-brained, you can infer that your photography will be
 Random: You’ll “shoot from the hip,” so to speak, taking pictures
unexpectedly of whatever you want. Sure, you might plan some, but
you realize that the creative moment is fleeting, especially if you don’t
take the time to compose your photo. Figure 4-5 shows a creative use of
the environment — in this case, the ocean, to create a spontaneous and
fun shot.
 Creative: You’ll seek and find the strange and unexpected and capture
it quickly with your camera. Taking a walk with your camera strapped
around your shoulder means that it won’t stay there long. You seek out
new ways to use your camera, taking pictures of nooks and crannies,
close up with settings that you’re not supposed to use.

Figure 4-5: Working your right brain creates spontaneity.
So are you one or the other — or perhaps both? Could be. And more. With
the special innate human ability that we have to learn new things, you can do
things that you ordinarily wouldn’t instinctively do. You can be a left-brained
photographer using right-brained techniques if you train yourself, or just take
the brain you have and specialize in the type of photography you want to
pursue, be it randomly shooting pictures of what you want or planning for
large-scale professional photo shoots.
All a matter of perspective
Have you ever gazed at a series of pictures of someone and noticed that the
person can look very different in each shot? A person can vary so much from
one photograph to another that he might not even look like the same person.
In a way, that’s perspective, whether from the advent of time (cough, aging,
as in Figure 4-6), mood, lighting, setting, angle, and so on. Perspective is
everything: Changing its focus is the difference between a birthday bash in
full swing or showing the remnants when it’s over. The more you can person-
alize the perspective in your photos, the more you define yourself as an art
photographer.

Figure 4-6: Perspective includes how people, fashion, and photography styles change.
For more about the popularity of nostalgia photos and how to retouch them,
see Chapter 12.
81
Chapter 4: Defining Yourself and Your Photographs
Classic perspectives
Over the centuries, artists from other media and
painters have given us standard perspectives,
such as the color and texture of natural elements
and the joy and pain of humanity. In 1885, Vincent
Van Gogh painted a series of portraits, including
Portrait of an Old Man with Beard and Head of an
Old Man. Both were close-ups and showed a side
(profile) view.
From the religious scenes painted by Leonardo da
Vinci (perfect anatomy of subjects expressed in
detail and clarity) to the photographs by Dorothea
Lange (the realities of the Great Depression),
artists use their expert eyes to balance light and
composition to capture their situation, feelings,
and emotions. These are the perspectives of
people that viewers of your photos will probably
like best. That doesn’t mean that you can’t bend a
few rules, though, and put your own spin on per-
spective. You can read more about perspectives
regarding portraiture in Chapter 7.

82
Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
To experiment with perspective, photograph something — anything — from
close up, far away, from all different angles (as in Figure 4-7), and in different
lighting situations.
Figure 4-7: Perspective also includes angle.

After you get the standards under your belt — perhaps by visiting museums
and checking out the masters — study the up-and-coming artists to see how
they “twist” some of the rules. Then branch out on your own to give your
viewers something unexpected. 
Finding the unusual
You can take your photography a step further by including the unexpected in
a portrait — for example, by including a close-up of a subject that’s not
human. For instance, instead of a human being, how about using something
else — say, a mannequin? Figuring out how to take an art photo of a nontradi-
tional subject is worth your while because viewers stop to look at art photos
in which you add a little more than what they expect — as I’ve done in the
portraits in Figure 4-8. (I guess you could call this trio a photo set; for more
on those, see Bonus Chapter 1. And for more on capturing non-human sub-
jects, see Chapter 7.) 
Figure 4-8: Manny and his kin provide interesting non-human portraits.
Statues and inanimate objects present an intriguing opportunity to present
the unexpected to the viewer.
83
Chapter 4: Defining Yourself and Your Photographs

84
Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
One step further: Consider other 
take-what-you-already-know-and-add-
a-little-more possibilities by throwing
potential Did you know? questions
at the viewers of your art photos.
For example, many people think of
coconuts as brown, but in their husks,
they’re green. And most coconuts in
Florida are bright golden yellow as
they ripen (as in Figure 4-9).
Defining Your Audience:
Creating Art That Sells
After you initially define yourself as a photographer, it’s time to define your
audience. Maybe your audience is just yourself; nothing wrong with that.
Macro or micro: That is the question
Close-up photography is another means of per-
spective. But is it macro or micro? What’s the 
difference and why should you even pay atten-
tion to these lenses/settings? When you think of
a micro lens, think of looking through a micro-
scope lens to make really small things look
bigger. Makes fascinating photography, but not
the kind of best-selling art photography you
would probably want to make.
A macro lens/setting works on the same 
principle — to make something small appear
larger. However, macro lenses also allow you to
get your camera/lens really close to your sub-
ject. Compare this with using a telephoto lens.
Sure, you make something small appear larger,
but a macro lens lets you get right on top of your
subject, capturing very fine detail and color.
Hey, wait a minute. Nikon calls its close-up
lenses micro, but they’re really macro. Perhaps
Nikon just wanted to be scientific about what it
calls its lenses.
At any rate, a macro setting comes on a lot of
cameras these days. It’s a quick turn of the knob
(usually found within the Auto modes on your
camera; see Chapter 2). You can catch anything
up close, like my “flower” here.
To make a macro shot crystal clear, use a tripod
when shooting to prevent blur.
Figure 4-9: Capture the unusual.

Perhaps, though, you’re looking to turn an avocation into a vocation: that is,
sell your photos. There are plenty of markets for art photos, from local stores
and restaurants to home decorating outlets to stock photo houses to gal-
leries to online venues to publications to. . . . Get the point? If you want to try
to create marketable art photos, the horizon is wide open. However, you do
need to figure out who will buy what. After all, folks at a tractor convention
likely aren’t interested in your photo collection of mannequins. And that
focus is what defining your audience
is all about.
So how to define your audience? Take
these factors into consideration: 
 What type of art does your audi-
ence like? Portraits, landscapes,
action (as in Figure 4-10)?
 What type of art does your audi-
ence collect?
 Does your audience have reli-
gious or political leanings?
 Where will they purchase your
art? Online? Shop?
 What can they afford?
Keep in mind that a potential audience
collects “things.” Maybe they yen for
pricey items, like vintage cars or deli-
cate objets d’art, as in Figure 4-11. You
can offer these folks an affordable way
to add to their collection.
Choosing subject matter
Your audience (or your taste) will
dictate what you photograph and
how you photograph it. So what
should you shoot? How do you find
interesting and compelling subject
matter? Do you need to go on safari
to exotic lands and hobnob with the
jetsetters to find exciting and dra-
matic subjects? Nah. Start in your
own backyard (which you probably
know pretty well) and always keep your eyes open for the art that exists all
around you.

Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
In your own backyard
Many people spend a significant part of their life in one area. Any area —
rural, suburban, or urban — is a great place to take art photos. To find objects
to include in your art photos, just take a look around. As a start, focus on the
colors, the landscape, the art, the lifestyle, the sports, the architecture, the
wildlife, the flora or where you live.
Through all your waking hours, you pass art, see art, and even make art. With
a digital camera in hand, your life is art. Everywhere you look, it’s there —
colors, shapes, forms, people, places, things — all art, all the time.
Notice, too, that your locality (and those to which you travel) is kind of an
independent and unique place on the world map, a place where unique things
happen and where pictures of life and art go unnoticed most of the time.
Figure 4-12 shows a local carnival. Carnival scenes are extremely popular both
among the museum/gallery set and among buyers all over the world. They show
both simple, colorful pleasures and sometimes-tawdry scenes with color playing
tantamount roles in what amounts to plays of the old Technicolor days of film.

Figure 4-12: Carnivals make for interesting material.

Find the art all around you
Think of your community as a place to find art objects for your photographs.
Whether a big city or small town, art abounds — you just have to find it. In
the art world is the concept of found art: namely, objects you find that you
put in an artistic context. Pieces can include almost anything, such as the 
following:
 Nuts and bolts
 Rusted signs
 The plastic holder from a six-
pack of cans
 A stick with perfect symmetry
 A fossil
Figure 4-13, an old sign weathered by
time, is a perfect example of an artful
found shot. As an artist, check out
and shoot different close-ups within
the context of your found art —
nooks and crannies and even the
critters within — just as sculptors do
for their works using found art.
See what sells
Another way to determine your subject matter is to research what sells. This
has two advantages:
 You know what subjects are popular.
 You can tell whether you’ve
found a hole — that is, a niche
market that no one else is filling.
Figure 4-14 shows a motel sign
from the middle of the last cen-
tury, one of a series that I’ve
produced for a niche market of
digital art photography. There
are many takers for the pop-
filled, so-called Googie images.
Photos of Googie architecture
sell. Googie landmarks are
everywhere, built in the 1960s,
featuring swoops, geometrical figures of steel, and sometimes neon.

Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
If you’re unsure what to photograph that’s saleable, you can do some search-
ing on the Internet to help you. There are many ways to do this and millions
of sites to choose from.
Here are two ways to get started:
 In your search engine, type in “stock photo” (include the quotes) as
keywords to find what type of images they show. 
Stock photos are the images that editors of magazines and newspapers
buy to print in their publications. The images are usually listed by cate-
gory, so that you can do a search for the type of image you like by typing
a word in the search of the stock photo Internet site. Searching a stock
house’s offerings shows you what images are saleable and what kinds of
images you might offer the stock house for sale.
 Go to your Internet search engine and type the name of your commu-
nity and the word “art” in the image search. What better way to find
images of your community to take a step further than seeing what’s out
there to begin with?
Presentation
Above all, your presentation must be stellar and unique. After all, you want
your photographs to stand out, be memorable, and be enjoyed for years.
That’s what presentation is all about. This is the culmination of your craft:
your subject, your perspective, composition, image finessing, printing, and
framing. Here are some ways to make your art stand above the common herd.
Push the envelope
Digital photography is an evolving art form. A ground swell of interest in the
subject is brewing, but much more can happen as the medium develops.
You can do much to develop the art form of digital photography:
 Move beyond traditional photography techniques applied to the digi-
tal realm. Digital photographers can develop new ways to work with the
medium before and while shooting and composing (as in my crazy zoom
in Figure 4-15). You can also manipulate your shot in an image process-
ing program like Photoshop as well as during printing. This book covers
lots of techniques to help you express yourself through your pho-
tographs; the more adventurous of you will want to home in on Chapters
11, 13, 14, and 20.

Figure 4-15: Get a little nuts and be creative!
 Collaborate with other artists to produce
new works of art. Existing paintings often can
be photographed with new results when they
are printed digitally. One example is a photo-
graph of a painting on velvet. Photographs
of this type of work actually turn out better
than the painting itself. (Maybe it has to do
with the fact that velvet collects dust easily.)
The portrait on velvet in Figure 4-16 is almost
50 years old; picked up at a garage sale and
photographed, this image was digitally
upgraded with great results.
You must be careful, however, not to commit
copyright infringement. Rather than be sorry,
consult with an attorney about this important
issue.

Part I: The Art of a Digital Picture 
 Take a photograph that makes a statement. Many photographers choose
to spotlight social issues, such as homelessness (as in Figure 4-17). These
types of compelling photographs make their way into many art museums
and high-end galleries. For more information about these types of issues
as they’re related to photojournalism, see Chapter 9.
Before using anyone’s likeness, consult a publications lawyer to make
sure you can use the image. Generally speaking, if the person or persons
in your image are identifiable, you’ll need to get signed model releases.
You can read more about these in Chapter 7.
 Use the knowledge and methods to make other art forms. And you can
help your viewers identify other disciplines that might interest them.
What better way to get your kids to look at their multiplication tables
than to photograph them written by them on a piece of paper or off a
black/whiteboard?

Figure 4-17: Social issues are often the subject matter of great 
photography works. 
Offer great quality
Target, Wal-Mart, Ikea, and similar stores all sell framed photos. Most are of
an inferior quality compared with what a photographer can print out on his
home computer and good-quality printer (say, Epson Stylus 2200 color inkjet).
Your personal touch adds a little more to what the big-box stores are selling,
making it a competitive, saleable product:
 The road to good photo art has finally been paved for the consumer.
Maybe the big-box outlets will catch on and sell the more artsy pieces,
too, but a creative digital artist is likely to outpace the art sold that is
mass-produced.

 The digital artist can find the
niche in subject matter for his
community (as in Figure 4-18)
that a big-box store probably
wouldn’t invest in. Subject
matter for a big-box store is lim-
ited to that which is derivative:
that is, tried and tested to not
offend every person in every
community in the country.
They don’t represent risk takers:
That’s left to the individual pho-
tographers and the museums,
galleries, and smaller shops that
display their work.
 The digital artist can create
images from photographs that
he took, using equipment and
processing tools and printers
that he chooses. The big-box stores use the same materials pretty much
nationwide.

Teaching students to create art 
with each year of their lives
Aside from smoking hand-rolled cigarettes, many
artists have been known to wear black. The truth
of the matter is that whether an artist wears
black or not, he has been trained one way or
another. Much of that training involves how to
paint (photography is painting with light), how
to frame, and, believe it or not, an investigation
into his or her life events as well as the history
of art and current events.
In the ’80s and early ’90s, when art came in the
form of video installations, and artists were just
beginning to play in the digital medium, profes-
sor Christine Tamblyn (San Francisco State
University) engaged her students in an activity
that helped them to recognize where they were
coming from. She taught her students how to
mine their own life for material for their art. The
point of this exercise was to stimulate students’
creativity or find out what they already knew, so
that perhaps they could add a little more.
The students had to find a space to perform their
most memorable public events (a reenactment
of a part they had in a play when they were eight
years old, for example) for each year of their life.
One student made little models with found mate-
rials (readily available and in a natural state),
models, toys, and pictures (hand drawn or pho-
tographs) for an event that occurred each year
in his life. He then put each model representing
the event in lockers in the locker room. For
instance, he had taken a trip across the coun-
try in an Airstream trailer when he was 15, so he
put a picture of one in locker number 15.

Repurpose the past
Going up into the attic and tossing through your great-grandfather’s WWII gear,
old JFK memorabilia, and perhaps a depression glass collection wrapped in
vintage 1940s The Kansas City Star newspaper sounds like a challenge . . . maybe
something you’ve been putting off for a long time. Don’t miss the opportunity
to search through all these wonderful treasures and photograph them before
you toss them in a garage sale.
Whether what you find are prints or slides (a positive image, in photographic
terms) or negatives or anonymous hand-drawn items that are about to fall
apart, you have a treasure trove of
photographic and restoration oppor-
tunities awaiting your creativity. Scan
these precious images and work your
magic with them, retouching them
and reproducing them.
Again, just be careful about infringing
on a copyright inherently or obvi-
ously (signed) belonging to another
photographer or creator. Consult with
an attorney to learn more about copy-
right and copyright infringement —
to make sure you don’t infringe upon
someone else’s work and also to pro-
tect your own.
Here’s an example of how you can
preserve and repurpose an old
image, bringing it into this millen-
nium. Figure 4-19 shows an older
image before and after sharpening it
and then applying the Photoshop
Colored Pencil filter. The digital
photo on top in the figure was taken
with a digital camera from an original
slide (a very old one at that, too) set
on a light table. Being of an artistic
mind, I decided to sharpen it and run
it through a Photoshop filter to
create my own version of the turn of
the last century.
Figure 4-19: Refurbish old art photos into new
art pieces.

If you think it’s not worth scanning a bunch of old family photos, think again.
If you have a scanner — and especially a negative scanner — you can trans-
form the old stuff in that dusty attic into a collection that spells a-r-t.
Here are four reasons to go up in the attic, bring down those photos, and digi-
tize them, either scanning the prints or scanning the negatives and/or positives:
 Enlargements of these types of photos are
being sold in the trendy LA stores for lots
of money. No kidding, prints of women and
men in wild ’40s, ’50s, and ’60s outfits are
fetching hundreds of dollars.
 Looking at an old photo’s patina onscreen
or in print is like taking a time machine
back in time. These treasures need hardly
any manipulation in Photoshop because
they’re amazing aged, just as they are, like
the picture shown in Figure 4-20.
 You discover how your older relatives
(and the dead ones) looked when they
were young. Geez, you find out that you
look like them! (Check out such a timeline in
Figure 4-6.) You’re also saving the photos for
future generations to see. Remember that
photos on photo paper don’t last forever. 
 You can add to your existing photo collec-
tion. Fill your photo folders with old and new and hang them on the
wall together. For example, combine the new street scene photos with
older ones.
Be wary when repurposing vintage photos. You might need permission, or at
least a model release, to reuse an image of someone. Even if that person is
deceased, you might have to contact their heirs for permission. See a copy-
right attorney for the exact rule about this and let him know what type of
photo you have as well as what you plan to do with it. Also, see Chapter 7
for more about this issue. Also, practice with your image editing program
(like Photoshop) to iron out scuffs and creases in old photos (see Chapter 12).
Above all, bring something new to the image: You could create a photo set,
tweak the color, use it in a montage — after all, if you’re just copying an old
photo, that doesn’t make you a photographer.

The Photo Shoot

In this part . . .
You’re at the right place to see how to create
great shots in any situation. Read all about
how to use ISOs, f-stops, exposure settings, and
ﬂash to your creative advantage. This part covers
the photography spectrum: shooting outdoors and
indoors (Chapters 5 and 6), photographing people
and animals (Chapter 7), crafting compelling color
and dramatic black-and-white images (Chapters 8
and 9), and capturing stunning nighttime images
(Chapter 10). If that isn’t enough, I ﬁnish off this
part in Chapter 11 with how to create special
effects while you’re shooting — even before you
tweak your digital images in an editor.

Composing a Shot Outdoors
In This Chapter
 Using natural light to your advantage
 Mastering common outdoor situations
 Boosting natural light
You have many ways at your disposal to compose a shot outdoors.
Fortunately, natural light is more than adequate, rain or shine, to give
you a decent image provided that you compose your shot with care. When com-
posing a shot outdoors, remember to assess where the sun is, what distance
you want to be from your subject, and how many objects you are focusing on.
Keep in mind, also, that as a digital art photographer, you have help — in the
form of an image processing program that comes later in your digital safari.
Shooting with Natural Light
When you shoot outdoors, light is your natural friend.
After all, light is what drives photography. However,
the tricks that light can play on your exposures can
prove to be gremlins that can haunt — or help —
your shots. You can creatively master how your
camera reads light via its settings, which help you
set the exposure you want, manually. Of course, auto
settings are at your fingertips as well, and can come in
handy when shooting under less-than-optimal lighting
conditions, like an overcast day, as in Figure 5-1.
When you set your camera to automatic, you don’t need to
know much about f-stops, shutter speeds, and depth of field.
Automatic settings let your camera calculate how the f-stop and shutter
speed should work together to give you the best picture under the circum-
stances that you are shooting in. Experiment a little, though, and adjust these
numbers, especially when you want to shoot moving objects (like waterfalls,
to see them behave dramatically) or to shoot at night (when you want the
lights to look like stars). In the next few pages, I describe f-stop settings and

98
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
shutter speeds so that you can make the adjustments necessary to achieve
your desired results. I discuss depth of field in the aptly named “Depth of
field” section, later in this chapter.
Figure 5-1: Auto settings can come in handy when shooting on an overcast day.
Proper exposure
Photography is all about light. To get the correct exposure for the art photo
you want, you need to know the settings that you can adjust and what they do.
The main players are ISO, f-stops, and shutter speed.
ISO
ISO settings determine how sensitive your camera is to light. When you shoot
at a lower ISO (less sensitive), you get better image quality with less of the
undesirable digital noise. However, when you shoot at a higher ISO (more
sensitive), you can capture stop-action (fast-moving) shots better, like sports
scenes or bounding gazelles on the plains of Africa. As always, there’s a
trade-off. When shooting at a lower ISO, you must use wider f-stops and
slower shutter speeds. That means that you lose depth of field and increase
chances of blur. Conversely, when shooting at a higher ISO, you lose some
detail and increase the amount of noise in the photo.
For more insight on ISO, skip to Chapter 6. For more on f-stops and shutter
speeds and how they interrelate, stay right here.

f-stops
Alert: There’s a hole in your camera, but that’s okay. Think of the hole in the
pinhole camera you probably made in grade school. That hole (the aperture)
in cameras lets light shine through the lens to expose the film or sensor,
depending on your camera type. On some cameras, you can manually adjust
the aperture size, which you want to do, depending on your lighting conditions.
Most prosumer camera models can change aperture size for you automatically.
For low-light situations (like indoors; see Chapter 6), you typically want a
larger aperture to let in more light. For brighter lighting conditions — such as
being outdoors on a sunny day — you want to use a smaller aperture to let in
less light. Think about how your pupils are wider in the dark and smaller in
sunshine, and you get the general idea.
Your camera’s f-stop setting controls depth of field, which is how much of the
image is in focus. With a shallow depth of field (a low f-stop), the subject is in
focus, while areas behind (and in front of) the subject are softly blurred. With a
higher f-stop, you have a greater depth of field and everything in the image is in
focus. (This assumes, of course, that you have actually focused on the subject!)
How wide an aperture opens is measured in f-stops. Some common f-stops
are f/2.8, f/4, f/5.6, f/8, f/11, f/16, and f/22. The larger the number, the smaller
the opening. Low numbers such as
f/2.8 (a digital camera shows only
the number 2.8 in the LCD display)
mean that the aperture in your
camera is open wide — perfect for
night shots outside, say at night
when the snowflakes are wet and
big. A setting such as f/22 (22 in
the LCD of your digital camera)
means that the aperture is small —
settings good for landscape shots,
say atop a hill overlooking a bluff on
a sunny day.
Figure 5-2 shows what happens when
you set your aperture to open a little
bit (on top — a high f-stop) and a lot
(on bottom — a low f-stop). You get
more background blur when your 
f-stop is low (big aperture opening).
Make sure you have a clear focus
when using a low f-stop so that at
least one object/subject is in focus.

Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Shutter speed
When cameras could be only manu-
ally adjusted (at a time when the
Earth’s crust was just being formed;
hey, it could seem like that for some
of you!), you also had to choose a
shutter speed, which is the amount of
time that the shutter lets in light to
expose film. (On a digital camera, this
is the length of time that the sensor
is exposed.) A shutter is like a cur-
tain covering where the film/sensor
lies within a camera. Think of playing
peek-a-boo: Your hands over your
eyes are the shutter, and your eyes
are the film/sensor. Figure 5-3 illustrates what happens when the shutter
stays open long enough to capture blur.
Shutter speeds are commonly marked as follows: 1, 2, 3, 8, 15, 30, 60, 125, 250,
500, 1000, 2000, and 4000. Except for 1, these time measurements are fractions
of a second. (The 1 means 1⁄1 second, or one whole second.) Thus, 2 means
one-half second, 3 means one-third second, 4 means one-fourth second, and
so on. Note how as the numbers grow larger, the speed actually decreases —
less light is allowed in the camera. Your camera also likely permits you to set
the shutter speed for longer periods, perhaps as long as 30 seconds. Those
same speeds now appear usually on the small LCD screen attached to your
camera. For special effects using long shutter speeds, see Chapter 11.
Using auto settings when shooting outdoors
Both digital and film cameras have automatic settings, which are handy for
shooting under a wide variety of circumstances, like for art photos captured
on the fly (often the best way to go when taking a picture). Here are the set-
tings and what happens to the shutter speed and f-stop when you set them:
 Auto: Everything is set for you: flash, focus, and exposure (the amount of
light reaching the sensor or film). The camera automatically adjusts both
the shutter speed and the f-stop for the amount of light on the sensor or
film to make a clear picture.
 Portrait: Choose this setting when you’re taking a photograph of people
up-close. This setting blurs your background but makes the profile of the
person clear and in focus. This happens when your camera’s f-stop is
small (the opening of the aperture is large, like f/5.6 or smaller), and the
shutter speed is quick (over 250).
 Motion (Sport): Opt for this setting when filming subjects in motion or for
when you’re in motion, like traveling on a train or in a car. Shutter speed
is quick. Figure 5-4 shows the action is stopped in mid-air with this setting.
Photo credit: Kevin Kirschner
Figure 5-3: Longer shutter speeds can cause
blur in your photo.

 Night: With this setting, shutter
speed is slow so more light can
be let in through the aperture.
Use the night setting during the
day to catch action for blurred
motion. Of course, you won’t
have control over how long the
shutter stays open (like you
have with a dSLR camera or
SLR camera).
 Landscape: Use this setting for
far-away objects. The aperture is
open only slightly (high f-stop).
Use this setting also if you want
your background and foreground
clear. Figure 5-5 illustrates a clear
foreground and background in a
landscape (waterscape?) photo
due to a small aperture.
 Close-up: Use this setting for
shooting, um, close up, like a
flower. You focus on your sub-
ject, and the rest of the picture
is blurred (similar to using the
portrait setting). On many prosumer digital cameras, you can get as
close as five inches to the subject.

tracks.

102
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
When you use a slow shutter speed or an automatic setting with a slow shut-
ter speed, be sure to keep the camera steady or use a tripod. If the camera
wobbles, you’ll get blur; this happens when the shutter is open long enough
to record your hands shaking.
Using manual settings for creative control
Auto settings can certainly come in handy, like when you’re grabbing a
quick shot. Life doesn’t always stand still, you know. However, for the ulti-
mate in creative control for your art shots, here are some techniques that
you can control via manual settings to help you compose exactly the shot
you want — what message you want to convey in your art photo. To set your
camera manually for really cool special effects and more complicated shoot-
ing, see Chapter 11.
Foreground and 
background
Foreground and background identifi-
cation is sometimes easier said than
done. Although many of the exam-
ples in Chapter 8 depict images with
clear divisions between foreground
and background, sometimes you
can’t distinguish one from the other.
For example, maybe the foreground
runs right into the background with
no lines or distinctions in between.
Here are some examples where fore-
ground and background are not
clear cut:
 The foreground and back-
ground lead to one another.
You know those shots — the
ones where the curvy road
leads through a prairie where
you can see the grass in front
lead (and get smaller) as it
extends to the back. Or then
again, how about a dock that
leads to a neighboring moun-
tain, like the one in Figure 5-6.
Photo credit: Ian Lumb
Figure 5-6: Blending foreground and
background to create an artsy effect.

In this image, a small aperture
gets you a clear shot all the way
across the water.
 There is no background. If
you want nothing but the
object itself, there is no back-
ground, as shown in Figure 5-7,
which was taken with a mid-
sized aperture to let the colors
soak in. The face of a map is
another example of a photo
that technically has no 
background.
 The background camouflages
an object in the foreground.
In some cases, such as in wild-
life photos (see Figure 5-8),
the backgrounds and fore-
grounds are similar. The young
lion is colored similar to its 
surroundings.
Eliminating foregrounds, middle
grounds, and/or backgrounds can
create unique shots. These types of
shots are like the sets of a theatrical
production and make the viewer feel
as if he is within the photo, perhaps
a character in it. 
Last, what does a picture look
like when there are objects in the
foreground, middle ground, and
background? It sounds like that
would spell c-l-u-t-t-e-r, but not neces-
sarily, especially if the objects are
enhanced or diminished with varying amounts of light and/or no light at all.
Figure 5-9 illustrates how one part of a picture, foreground, middle ground, or
background, can frame another part.

Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Figure 5-9: Foreground objects frame a middle ground object with a dark background.

Depth of field
The distance away from your lens in which your image retains its clarity is
depth of field. Long depths of field are created by using small apertures (or
large f-stops). When photographing landscapes, you can set your camera to
landscape mode to have it calculate a depth of field so that your image stays
clear throughout. In Figure 5-10, the image on top (of a tunnel lined by unusual
rock formations) has a long depth of field — taken with a high f-stop; the image
on the bottom (of a bird in its nest) has a short depth of field — low f-stop.
Figure 5-10: Top: deep depth of field; bottom: shallow depth of field.
105
Chapter 5: Composing a Shot Outdoors

106
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
For the greatest depth of field, shoot
on clear days when you can see for-
ever with your back to the sun later in
the day, and set your camera so that
its aperture is small (f-stop is high).
An intentional shallow depth of field
can be quite desirable because it
makes the subject of the shot truly the
star — it’s the only thing in clear focus.
For example, see the raindrop on a leaf
in Figure 5-11. Because its background
is not in true focus, the raindrop’s
graceful beauty shines even brighter.
Bracketing
You can use your high-end dSLR or film SLR to get a variety of images at differ-
ent exposures — hedging your bets, as it were. Exposure bracketing is a setting
that lets you adjust your exposure to lighten or darken it by measured inter-
vals, capturing a series of individual shots with differing exposure settings.
Using this technique is obviously easier with a digital camera because you can
see the images right away and toss the ones that you don’t want. Figure 5-12
shows how changes in your exposure affect the tones and color of your image.
Sometimes in less-than-perfect weather situations or when it’s overcast, using
bracketing can help assure a properly exposed shot.

Figure 5-11: Shallow depth of field makes the
subject stand out.
Keeping white balance when outdoors
Indoor and outdoor light is different; each gives
your picture an entirely different hue. Most digital
cameras give you a setting to adjust this: white
balance. The function of white balance is to find
a reference point for what is “white” and then
to correct offbeat hues (based on this reference
point) in your entire photograph while you shoot.
Most film cameras have no white balance set-
ting, so you have to deal with brown tones
indoors and blue outdoors. Most digital cam-
eras, however, have a manual setting for white
balance that ensures the best results. (For more
about white balance, see Chapter 8.)
On most digital cameras, you can set white bal-
ance as follows:
 Auto: This is the default setting, in which the
camera automatically sets itself when you
take a picture. It’s great for general picture
taking.
 Daylight: This setting is good for natural
lighting — all sun, outdoors, with no artificial
light coming into your picture.
 Indoor: Some cameras use this as a setting.
Other cameras divide the Indoor setting into
the types of light you find inside — tungsten
or fluorescent. For more about lighting sub-
jects indoors, see Chapter 6.

Figure 5-12: Two pictures, each at a different exposure.
Common Outdoor Lighting Situations
The more you shoot outdoors, the more you’ll find that the sun can be your foe
or friend. This section covers the most common outdoor lighting situations that
you’ll encounter — and how to use them to your art photo creative advantage.
Creating a vivid shot with your back to the sun
Color. A lot of people want it. Color can help a photo sell, but bright colors
without harsh shadows are what gallery owners like. Simple prosumer cam-
eras require that you set them to a daylight setting. Although this setting
does a pretty good job, higher-end dSLR models can be manually set in most
of the same ways as a film SLR can. For more about setting your camera for
maximum color, see Chapter 8. For more information about prosumer versus
high-end dSLR cameras, see Chapter 2.
So how do you get a lot of color in a photo shoot? For starters, by following
these basic guidelines:
 Have your back to the sun. With the sun to your back, your subject is lit
from the front and devoid of shadows. You’ll probably get a better expo-
sure reading, too, because your aperture won’t have to open wide and your
shutter can open and close promptly, without blur where you don’t want it.
107
Chapter 5: Composing a Shot Outdoors

108
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Just try to avoid making your
human subjects stare into
intense sun to prevent them
from squinting.
 Have lots of ambient light. Ambi-
ent light is good anytime during
the day in winter when the sun
is low in the sky. In summer, it’s
best to stick to morning and/or
afternoon sun, staying away
from times when the sun is
directly overhead, a time when
the sun is so harsh it can overex-
pose parts of your image. Figure
5-13 shows how the afternoon
sun can help to create just the
right amount of light to make
the picture crystal clear.
 Have a good camera. A high-end
point-and-shoot or an SLR or a
dSLR — where you can manu-
ally set the shutter speed
and/or f-stop — will help you get
better exposures for different
kinds of foregrounds and/or backgrounds.
 Have a subject full of bright colors. Fill your photos with bright colors
or unique features, like broad steel vertical beams that are often placed
on high-rises to accentuate their strength, or appearance of strength.
 Place objects in clutter-free backgrounds. Clutter usually gives a both-
ersome disruption to the flow of a photograph. Making your background
clutter-free is dependent on the size of the object:
• For movable objects: Place them on a clutter-free surface (the
ground will do) and shoot standing up with the sun at your back.
• For immovable objects: Position yourself with your back to the
sun and find the part of the surface where there are no shadows.
Taking close-ups of people outside requires that you use the portrait mode.
However, this mode does not protect your subjects’ eyes from squinting when
you’re sitting comfy with your back to the sun and they’re facing the sun.
You can, however, move your subjects to the shade or wait and take your pho-
tograph during the magical moments of the sunset when the light is less harsh.
To get finer detail in subjects that are washed out because of overexposure
(too much light around them), get close to the subject, lock the exposure
(lightly press the shutter control and hold it there), step back, and then take
the picture. Note: You get a very bright white background doing this.
Figure 5-13: Photograph outdoors with your
back to the sun during late afternoon to get
great exposure.

Take a look at the picture of part of a
church in Figure 5-14. You’ve got two
things working in your favor here, just
the state you want when you’re
shooting with your back to the sun:
 The surface of the object is
nearly free of harsh shadows.
 The light is bright, so the color
is deep. (For more about light
and color, see Chapter 8.)
Facing the sun
Shooting into the sun is not always a
bad thing. This technique can provide
many opportunities for unique art
photos, determined by the shapes in
the foreground as well as the effects
created by light — specifically, the
backlighting of the sun. This tech-
nique is the opposite of shooting with
your back to the sun, as I discuss in
the preceding section (“Creating a
vivid shot with your back to the
sun”). See Figure 5-15 for a compari-
son of the two photographing techniques, both with very different effects.

Chapter 5: Composing a Shot Outdoors
Figure 5-14: Shoot with the sun at your back to
capture vivid color.

110
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
The effects you get shooting into the sun are just the opposite of shooting
with the sun behind you:
 Subjects lose their color. The more aligned your subjects are in front of
the sun, the darker they are until they become total silhouettes when
they block the sun. Notice in Figure 5-16 how the subject and his kiosk
are so dark that they appear almost black. You don’t always get a lot of
detail with this technique, but you get some really cool light rays (and
sometimes lens flare).
If the light at sunset or sunrise is blasting into your eyes and you see a
subject in a beautiful silhouette, snap a picture of it.
Ansel your landscapes
When you think depth of field, you might think of
Ansel Adams, one of the greats in landscape
photography. Adams captured the essence of
America’s coast-to-coast landforms from scenic
overlooks in U.S. national parks to the close-ups
of flowers there. His imagery illustrated the fine
art of texture from smooth rocks to the jutting
sticks of tree branches. If one word could be
used to describe how Adams photographed
landscapes, that word would have to be detail.
Adams worked with film: big format film, film
several inches long by several inches wide, film
that required a special lens. He waited for the
right time to take a picture, and he got to know
the places where he photographed. Emulating
Adams using your digital camera can be pur-
sued first by knowing a place where there’s
nothing but nature around, knowing when the
weather will be good, knowing a viewpoint from
which to photograph, and knowing what time of
day to go there for the best light.
You can get pictures from high-end digital cam-
eras with the same clarity that Adams got, 
provided you find that special natural place that
you know well and use a tripod when shooting.
Try a variety of shutter speeds and exposures,
and then pick out the best of a series. This land-
scape shot is the best of a series taken by a
photographer with a 6.1MP Olympus point-and-
shoot camera at Joshua National Park. Aperture
openings were small to create a long depth of
field in this shot.

Figure 5-16: Shoot directly into the sun for flare.
 Backgrounds lighten. With a
lightened background, colors
turn to pastels (not bold pri-
mary colors) because of the 
distance and all the atmos-
pheric particles that your
camera picks up from its lens
to the edge of the world (the
horizon, that is). In Figure 5-17,
the background has turned
to pastel blue.
Avoiding and exploiting
shadows
Obviously, shooting either with your
back to the sun or facing the sun can
cause unwanted shadows. Think of
the shadow cast by a sundial, and you
get the idea. Take care when compos-
ing your shot that you don’t capture
a shadow that you don’t want —
especially one that you, as the 
photographer, unwittingly cast.
111

shooting into the sun.

Part II: The Photo Shoot 
In an informal shot outdoors, harsh shadows can darken features so they
communicate practically nothing. Take, for instance, the picture of the young
woman in Figure 5-18. The picture on the left was taken with a flash in the
sun. And the one on the right was taken without a flash. When you take a pic-
ture outside in the sun using your flash, you have used the flash fill feature,
which lessens the harsh daytime shadows in portrait mode.
Setting flash fill is easy. On the body of most camera models there’s a picture
of a lightening stroke. That’s the flash control. Press the button and look in
the LCD. Navigate to where it says flash fill and set your camera to that
option. Take your picture. 
However, the art photographer in you can master how to exploit and take
advantage of dramatic shadows in your works.

Fences are a wonderful source of
shadows. Wait until the sun is burst-
ing through the slats and shoot a
photo that conveys a feeling of move-
ment and perspective, as shown in
Figure 5-19.
Shooting at noon, dusk,
and dawn
Because you can’t always have the
sun exactly where you want it, you
need to master how to shoot at the
times of day when sunlight isn’t
exactly optimal. At noon, for exam-
ple, light is very intense. And because it’s directly overhead, you can get
some unwanted shadows on people’s faces from a hat or their glasses (or
even their nose!). Conversely, when shooting at dawn and dusk, light can be a
bit anemic and sometimes throw off the color you want. However (you could
see this coming, right?), you can always take a less-than-optimal lighting situ-
ation and turn it to your creative advantage. Here’s how.
Shooting at noon
The open container of (sugar-free)
jelly beans in Figure 5-20 shows how
colors can really pop in bright sun-
light. I moved this object outdoors
with sunlight shining directly on it.
Photographed with the sun beating
down on my back, the color of the
jelly beans stands out dramatically
against the highlights and shadows
of the tray.
Be careful to keep your own shadow out of the photograph. That takes some
maneuvering of your body so that you also don’t distort the perspective of
the object while you’re attempting to photograph it from the middle, and so
that its horizontal plane stays horizontal within the frame. Of course, keep in
mind that while most photos will be judged by these rules, art photos can and
often do break the rules of horizontal and vertical planes.

Shooting at dawn or dusk
Shooting when light is soft can be a little tough. However, the softness during
these times of day can be exactly the message you want to convey, as shown
in Figure 5-21, a shot of early morning. With some clouds to help diffuse the
fading daylight, shooting at sunset is nothing but the very definition of drama.

Glare and flare
Glare and flare are two banes of any photogra-
pher shooting outdoors. For example, when you
shoot something reflective, like glass, smooth
plastic, or water (see the following section),
glare is sure to pop in uninvited, as shown in
Figure 5-22.
114
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Figure 5-22: Glare can be a neat
or unwanted effect.

 Glare: If you want the glare, great. Hey,
it’s your art. To avoid it, though, really
study the image in your viewfinder. Avoid
shooting shiny surfaces, and don’t use
flash when shooting something through
plate glass, like a storefront window (see
Figure 5-23).
 Flare: Flare is a bit different of an animal.
Caused by a diffraction of light rays
(that’s enough science for me), you can
get unwanted beams of light or sometimes
a halo or white outlining effect on a subject.
Hmmm. How can you use these anomalies
to your creative advantage? Check out
Figure 5-24 to see how cool exploiting flare
can be.
Sometimes contrast can be compromised
when a halo appears throwing the whole 
picture out of whack. Halos are not a good effect if too large and in the
wrong place.

Shooting glare on water, ice, and snow
Shooting water — or things on water, like animals, boats, and skiers — can
be tricky. Water is shiny and it moves. Not a great combination for a subject.

without flash to prevent glare.

116
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Stick with me, though, to see how you can turn both minuses into great art
photos.
When a lot of light reflects off water, your camera’s light meter can be tricked
and read for that bright light instead of exposing for your subject. Maybe that’s
not what you want — or is it?
What you have here is an exposure see-saw, when the shutter speed is quick,
the aperture widens to make up for the difference in light. Sometimes, though,
water glare can be downright pretty, becoming the subject of the photo.
Water glare gives you a shimmering effect by the water’s reflection from the
sun beating down on it. No question about it, water glare is one of the most
thrilling items of photography, as shown in Figure 5-25.
Photo credit: Kevin Kirschner
Figure 5-25: Exploit the effect of water glare.

And don’t forget about the glare from frozen
water! Snow and ice can also provide you with
some outstanding art opportunities.
If you don’t want the glare from ice, do a spot
read in a midtone area of your shot. That way,
you won’t overexpose from the light your camera
reads from the reflective surface. Figure 5-26
(an image from the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration [NOAA]) is well
exposed but offers enough glare to be compelling.
Throw a stone in a still pond and then shoot the
resulting concentric ripples for a great art shot
that shows motion through the use of a pattern of
contrast and glare.
Weather and atmosphere
Another adage: Everyone talks about the weather,
but no one does anything about it. Well, in digital
photography you can do something about the weather, albeit not a lot — and
not without compromising pixels.
Every weather condition affects the picture you take. Every speck of dust and
every cloud (see Figure 5-27) affect the picture you take. It’s just a matter of
the weather you have to work in and what you want from your camera and
your resulting print.
Get a variety of images at different exposures — bracket your shots — in iffy
weather. Read more about this in the earlier section, “Bracketing.”
 Sunshine: Read about shooting in bright light in earlier sections of this
chapter.
 Fog, mist: Fog can cause your subjects to be underexposed. That is,
you’ll have trouble seeing the details within them. But Figure 5-27 shows
that morning fog can add mystery to a photo as well. (Thanks to NOAA
for this image; www.photolib.noaa.gov.)

flare, especially at night, and even added dramatic color. Figure 5-28
shows that despite the inherent grays and drabness, rainy or wet condi-
tions can still offer you opportunities to bring in some reflective color.

 Clouds: Clouds truly can be your ally with some breaks and puffs here
and there, when you find dramatic ones against a clear blue sky, or when
a storm approaches (as shown in Figure 5-29). Also, don’t forget how
light can paint clouds at sunrise and sunset.

Augmenting Natural Light
As kind as the sun can be, providing you with lots of wonderful light to expose
your shots, sometimes Ol’ Sol needs a little help, like when it’s overcast. Or,
sometimes Ol’ Sol gets a little help when he didn’t ask for it, like when you’re
shooting something brightly lit during the day, like a carnival. Here’s how to
make the best of each situation.

Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Using flash fill
As I discuss earlier (refer to Fig-
ure 5-18), you can use flash fill to
help remove shadows on the subject.
When conditions are hazy or over-
cast, or you’re shooting a subject in
the shade, flash fill can also be used
to help add light to provide details. 
Shooting bright lights 
in daytime
Your camera’s light meter can get
fooled by intense light emitted from
bare light bulbs, like twinkle (holiday)
lights on Christmas trees or the won-
derfully gaudy lights of a carnival.
When you shoot these during the
day (like the photo in Figure 5-30),
take care to make sure that your
exposure is accurate. Watch out,
too, when you’re shooting at a sports
field — sometimes those giant floods
kick on while you still have available
light.

S
hooting indoors is inherently more difficult than shooting outdoors
because you don’t have optimal light — and what light you do have is
often garish and harsh (creating sharp unintentional silhouettes) or has a
color temperature that can give you unnatural tones (like how people turn
green when shot under fluorescents or orange when shot under tungsten).
And, after all, light is what drives photography. In this chapter, I show
you tricks and tools for how to take that disadvantage and turn
it into an artistic opportunity.
Finding the right type of light for your indoor shots is
like performing a science experiment. Remember when
you had to write a hypothesis in the form of a question
and then answer that question? In an experiment with
indoor lighting, your questions might be, “How do I
light my object or scene so that my shot is clear and
natural looking? Or interesting? Or have movement?”
You can make dozens of hypotheses (questions) about
using natural or man-made lighting — or both — to
create a unique scene or present an object from either
a traditional or a new viewpoint.
Start by thinking about the tools at your disposal (your camera
and flash) and then factor in the world around you (man-made or
natural ambient lighting). Next, determine whether the lighting that you’re

122
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
using answers your questions. Finally, consider the results: Did you get
the results you expected, or were your results better than you could have
hoped for?
This chapter takes you through the process of asking — and more importantly,
answering — the questions involved with taking indoor art photographs so
great that people clamor to buy them.
Setting Up to Shoot Indoors
When you shoot indoors, you (understandably) have less light than what is
available outdoors. To compensate for this — without using flash — you
need to adjust your camera’s ISO speed. You also need to know when to
choose manual over automatic exposure settings and also how to work
toward achieving good white balance.
ISO speed
To compensate for shooting with not-always-optimal available light indoors,
you need to adjust your camera’s ISO speed. In terms of a digital camera, ISO
could be called sensor sensitivity. Strange but true. With film, you have film
sensitivity — that is, how sensitive the film is to light. These standard film rat-
ings are set by the ISO (International Standards Organization). You might also
see ASA film ratings, but ISO and ASA are similar.
The lower the ISO number, the less sensitive film is to light. Thus, 100 ISO
film needs more light to capture the same shot than 400 ISO film does. The
same holds true when shooting on a digital camera. All you really need to
know in terms of the settings on your digital camera are the 100, 200, 400,
and 800 ISO settings. Some cameras go lower and higher. However, when
you set ISO lower than 100, you can get a lot of blur if you don’t use a
tripod. Shooting at ISO settings above 400 (or 800 for some cameras) can 
produce digital noise (unwanted red, green, and blue specks in the image)
or luminance noise (undesirable light specks in the image). Digital noise is
generally most evident in areas of shadow and solid color. When using your
camera’s flash, the ISO is usually set to either 100 or 200, depending on the
model.

Figure 6-1 shows a picture at various ISO values. Note that the higher the ISO,
the more noisy the image becomes.
If you have a tripod, use it and shoot using a lower ISO and a slowed shutter
speed. If not, brace the camera on a stable surface and use a slightly higher
ISO. If neither a tripod nor a stable surface is available when shooting in low-
light situations, you need to choose between possible blurring (low ISO) or
noisy shadows (high ISO).
So, what’s the setting verdict for taking pictures of stuff inside? That’s one of
the easiest tricks in photography, digital or film. Simply set your ISO speed at
400 (or buy 400 ISO film for your film camera and then digitize your prints/
negative/positives).

Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Manual versus auto settings
Determining the proper setting — manual or auto — to use when you shoot
indoors without a flash all depends on whether you shoot with a tripod:
 Most shots indoors come out great in auto mode without a flash, but
only if you use a tripod. In auto mode, most cameras default to low ISO
values. If you want special effects — such as blur from movement — you
need to use a tripod and you also must keep your shutter open longer
than what your camera would in auto mode.
 If you hand-hold your camera, set your ISO values high (greater than
400). Many cameras allow you to change the ISO and yet still shoot in
auto mode.
White balance
When you take a photo indoors 
without a flash, the color of the light
you’re shooting is enhanced, some-
times greatly. Figure 6-2 shows a
golden hue that happens automati-
cally (due to the color of the lights)
when you take a picture without a
flash indoors (with 400 ISO to reduce
blur). Many digital cameras automat-
ically correct this when they’re set
to indoors, but maybe you don’t
want to — to gain that artistic edge.
(You can read more about white 
balance in Chapter 8.)
Taking Indoor Pictures 
without Flash
The simplest scenario when shooting indoors is to just shoot — no flash, no
nothing. Just shoot and go. You can get some decent shots that way, using
only what light is available.
Photographing light as it is — flickering, glimmering, glistening, raining, shad-
owing, frightening, trickling, and twinkling — with all indoor light or outdoor
light coming indoors in all its lit glory sometimes is best done without the
Figure 6-2: Use non-white light to your advantage.

help of your flash. Take a look at Figure 6-3. I took
this photograph (with no flash) inside a subway
station, using only the lighting there. (This photo-
graph also offers an example of using the vanish-
ing point to create visual interest.)
No flash? Indoors? No worries. With today’s digital
photo technology, you can indeed take a picture
indoors without a flash. At higher ISO speeds and
under the right circumstances, you don’t need a
flash. The right circumstances, mind you, have to
do with the availability of light. Eye the light
around you, seeking some for your picture when
you don’t plan on using a flash.
When filming indoors, set your digital camera no
higher than 400 ISO to find a compromise
between graininess and blur.
Using available light only
So why not just use a flash instead of moving around the camera and yourself
and/or your object, seeking out available light? Although flash as fill light can
be your friend, flash light can also be a little obtrusive and difficult to control.
For example, flash light sometimes interrupts what you’re photographing,
smacking it with a big white splash in just the part that you wanted to show
up clear. This will happen without a doubt when you film shiny, plastic, flat
surfaces with dark colors, or when you shoot through glass.
Trust me, though; it’s okay to shoot
indoors without a flash. To get great
shots indoors without a flash, you
just have to position yourself and
your subject to make the best of
indoor lighting. For instance, in
Figure 6-4 (taken without a flash
and obviously indoors), the little
girl is lit with natural light coming
through a window to her left.
Because I didn’t shoot directly into
the light, the girl is evenly and softly
lit, illuminating her perfectly and
giving nice, soft colors suitable for a
little girl.

shadows caused by the blinds also add a slightly dramatic effect.

Intentional blur
When shooting indoors, you can use a seeming disadvantage — not much
available light in which to shoot — to your advantage. For example, without
enough light, moving subjects can be blurry. Hmmm. Take that information
and turn it into an art photo opportunity.
Indoor photography has gotten much easier with the advent of digital pho-
tography. You can shoot on the spot without having to go out and buy film.
(See the earlier section, “ISO speed,” for more information about exploiting
ISO speeds.) You also set your digital camera to the correct ISO without
having to change cameras (like with film) or wait till one roll of an ISO film is
done before changing to another. Before you read on, though, I want to take
a moment to discuss blur. Blur is an oft-spurned element of photography that
is usually left to the professionals. I can’t think of any logical reason for this
except that maybe people thought the pros had better control over the beast.

But blur is not such a wily beast; you
can tame it under the right circum-
stances. This is not new stuff, either,
but it is as modern as photography.
When the 19th century came to an
end, photographers began shooting
images not to solely copy real life but
in an attempt to change it, following
literature and other visual arts in
taking the viewer away from what
was thought of as real to the artist’s
subjective world — real and other-
wise. In the late 19th and early 20th
centuries, photographers began
using blur as a tool to create their
art. Figure 6-6 shows a blurred image
that was produced at a low ISO in
low light and shot in auto setting.
That’s one of the easiest, but not
most effective, ways to produce con-
trolled and artistic blur.
Blur is like poetry: Its interpretation
can be left to your viewer. Basically,
you just create it — either you plan
for it, let it happen intentionally, or have it happen by mistake. However it
happens to be created, you can be sure that each time blur is created, it
always sparks curiosity:
 Make blur a strong element in
your art photos. Blur makes
scenes anonymous, adding mys-
tery to people and/or scenes. If
either a part/person or the
entire image of an image is
blurred (as in Figure 6-7), you
sense added thoughtfulness,
such as the passage of time
among life’s fleeting moments. 
 Create blur as an intended
effect in your images.
Sometimes you just don’t have
enough light indoors to create a
clear image, no matter what you
do. However, if your subject moves in real life anyway, blurring it in the
photo can make it look like it’s moving.

128
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
 Create blur by panning your camera. If you pan just right, you can get a
clear picture of your subject, which I discuss further in Chapter 11. Or
you can just swing your camera following your subject to blur it, as in
Figure 6-8.
Photo credit: Kevin Kirschner
Figure 6-8: Pan your camera while you shoot to create blur.
Don’t think that you can clear up a blurred shot in Photoshop. The technol-
ogy isn’t there yet although it is getting better. The Smart Sharpen filter in
Photoshop CS2 can do a very good job with some slight blurring, but severe
blur is not something you can edit away.
Taming available 
bright light
A picture can be a big disappoint-
ment if your subject comes out too
light. This happens sometimes when
you’re filming a person within a bright
background. Your camera’s light
meter probably calculated the shot.
The light meter is the device inside
your camera that evaluates how
much light is in a scene so that your
camera’s sensor can produce a prop-
erly lit picture, unlike the one shown
in Figure 6-9, which is too light.
Photo credit: Kevin Kirschner
Figure 6-9: Subjects can come out too dark in
uneven, ambient light.

Sometimes, though, the sensor can’t calculate
it accurately because there’s too much light
around the subject. If you’re photographing
in an automatic setting and don’t want to fool
around with your camera’s setting, move
closer (or zoom in) to the subject so that there’s
little or no background, like in the photo shown
in Figure 6-10.
Adjust your exposure compensation for more
light to go to the sensor. Most high-end and
midrange digital cameras offer a feature called 
exposure compensation. To give your subject
more light, you need to overexpose, or add
more light to your shot: You need to adjust 
exposure compensation to the positive values
that your camera displays. Negative values
underexpose your shot, which is a concept that
I discuss further in Chapter 8. (Keep in mind,
however, that when you’re talking about digital
images you plan to manipulate in Photoshop,
overexposure is more damaging than underexposure. The reason for this is
that after pixels are “whited out,” no information is available. True, mod-
erately underexposed images produce more grain when you correct them in
Photoshop, but at least you have some information to work with.)
When you photograph a person in a bright background and you overexpose
your shot, it evens out the available light that’s there. And although certain
reflective backgrounds, like glass, will blast with white, this effect can be
quite undesirable.
The flashes on many prosumer and dSLR cameras do a great job in filling in
uneven ambient light. I suggest using it inside for portraits of people.
Taking advantage of color imbalance
What at first sight might look like the wrong hue or tone in a photo might not
really be wrong at all. Sometimes the tones and hues produced by indoor
light can be mesmerizing, bringing the viewer to what looks like the future
(very white light) or the past (light with a mustard tone). Fluorescent light
appears white and gives that futuristic-looking effect shown in the left image
in Figure 6-11. Tungsten appears yellow in the right image of Figure 6-11. For
more about color imbalance, check out Chapter 8.

zoom in.

Figure 6-11: Fluorescent and tungsten lighting can give color imbalance.
Augmenting Indoor Light
Finding fascinating light indoors is not that hard. After all, light is every-
where, but sometimes there just isn’t enough to properly expose a shot. What
should you do? The obvious answer is to shoot with a flash. Filming without a
flash usually yields better results because using ambient light provides a
total lighting effect that is more even. However, using a flash is not a panacea
to low-lighting blues because a flash can travel only a short distance.
A traditional rule of photography is to not mix light — that is, indoor and 
outdoor — in the same picture. In traditional portrait and landscape photog-
raphy, combining light sources is probably not a good idea because it can
cause your camera’s light meter to read parts of your picture in error. However,
sometimes mixing light in an art photo — augmenting indoor light — can
create a distinctive effect. For more about light and light temperatures, see
Chapter 8.

Figure 6-12 shows how a camera’s light meter has no trouble reading the
yellow light (tungsten). However, the other light within the frame is misread
as pure blaring white that looks like the film and/or sensor has been burned.
Photo credit: Kevin Kirschner
Figure 6-12: When you mix light, your camera can make errors reading one or the other.
Comparing shooting with and without flash
Your camera’s built-in flash can leave white blotches on your image. Sure,
you probably can take out these flash blasts in Photoshop later, but that’s
time-consuming. The best solution to this problem is to either move the
image to better light or to use a tripod.
If you have a situation where you don’t have enough light (or where you’re
not sure whether you have enough light), take two photographs — one with
a flash and one without a flash — as in Figure 6-13.
Each exposure has its own merit:
 With flash (left): The subject is clear and evenly lit.
 Without the flash (right): The subject is lit more dramatically, without
background shadows, and looks a bit more natural.

Combining indoor and outdoor light
In Figure 6-14, the light peeks from outside in the top of the picture, giving the
viewer a sense of a way in and a way
out. A couple of things about the
light in this shot makes it interesting:
 The reflection from the indoor
lights sink into the floor, mixing
brown tones with yellow, which
is a good color match.
 The outdoor light in the back of
the photo is natural, contrasting
the indoor light in color and
intensity.
 The outdoor light provides a
background for the moving
man — one that brings the
image of him forward, pro-
pelling him in the direction
that he is moving.
Figure 6-14: Mixing light can create an
interesting effect in an art photo.

Here’s another way to combine indoor
and outdoor light. Figure 6-15 has been
taken from inside a truck. The camera
is inside a truck, using the light coming
through the windshield. This light cre-
ates excellent back light, meaning that
the subject (the dashboard scene) is
lit from the back. Also notice the fill
light — the light coming from the win-
dows on either side. Fill lights, well, fill
the front and back to reduce shadow.
The front light here is very subtle and
smooth (coming from the rear
window), just where the sun is peeking
through, creating an almost perfect
lighting situation for a dancing hula
girl. For more about fill lights and back
lights, see the later section, “Adding
extra light sources; studio set up.”
Using whiteboards
You need to use whiteboards (or reflec-
tors) when you’re shooting in a room
with only one or two fluorescent or tungsten lamps. Notice the difference when
you use a whiteboard (left image in Figure 6-16) compared with not using one
(image on the right in Figure 6-16). Whiteboards are easy to make. Because a
whiteboard can be made out of any type of board that is white, you can find
something to use in almost a dozen sizes at any office store. Styrene boards
are great stuff to use to make reflectors. Just cut your whiteboard in two, hinge
the pieces, and tape it together so it can sit on a table like an open book.
When you photograph in many offices or stores, you won’t need to use a white-
board because these places already have lots of fluorescent lights that offer you
enough light to take a good picture. And if you can’t obtain a whiteboard when
photographing in a poorly lit area, you can use other flat, reflective items in
place of a whiteboard, like a regular ol’ umbrella (yes, opened) or even a tray.
Adding extra light sources; studio set up
Sometimes the available light indoors or reflective devices are just not enough
light for your needs. When that happens, you might have to resort to adding
light sources for your shoot.
Although not the route many digital photographers are going to take while
photographing scenes and objects, professional lighting such as that done
with portable fluorescent lights and stands offers some good concepts about
how to create different effects in your photographs.

Figure 6-16: Using a whiteboard boosts the lighting effect.
A photograph of a hula girl earlier in this chapter (refer to Figure 6-15) shows
you how light from all around an object — the back, the front, and the sides —
can create a good picture without shadows and with softened controlled light.
In contrast, Figure 6-17 shows the placement of lights in a studio or for a TV
production — ideas that you can use by looking around at the light you have
available:
 Key light effect: This effect is achieved when you place your object
directly in front of a strong light source, with no other light around it.
Using only a key light produces harsh shadows if the surface isn’t flat.
If it is flat, it could produce great color. (See Chapter 8, where I discuss
getting great color in your photographs.)
 Fill light effect: Place your object near a weak light to get a fill light
effect. For example, if you place an object on the side of a 60-watt lamp
(or to the side of the sun at dusk or dawn), and that is the only light
source, you get a mysterious effect, or even a spooky one. The subway
picture earlier in this chapter (refer to Figure 6-2) uses many fill lights.
 Back light effect: Place a light behind an object to get a back light effect.
This produces almost the same effect as shooting into the sun, as I dis-
cuss in Chapter 5.

Figure 6-17: A light set-up scheme.
The images in Figure 6-18 show how using each of these lighting techniques
can affect your shot.
You can use these light placements in combination inside your home and
anywhere else by renting studio lighting. Studio lighting usually comes in kits,
some with two lights and a reflector umbrella. Instead of using a fill light, the
umbrella bounces the light off the key light.

Shooting Indoors with Flash
In the earlier section, “Comparing shooting with and without flash,” I discuss
how flash photography indoors is a viable alternative to lighting your subject,
provided that your subject
 Is close enough to the camera: Your camera’s flash spreads light only a
few feet in front of you; this depth varies depending on your flash. The
light that it spreads is white light and quite effective on human subjects.
 Doesn’t have a reflective surface: If you’re shooting from behind glass
with a flash, you’ll get a lot of light bouncing all over the place. You prob-
ably should think about that when taking a picture of a framed picture
behind glass.
Many digital cameras will use a low ISO when your picture is taken with a flash
so that your image is crystal clear. If you provide your own light, it automatically
sets the ISO higher, resulting in a less clear shot. For more on ISO settings
and auto mode, see the beginning of this chapter.

P
hotographing anything living usually requires that you establish
some sort of relationship with the subject. When you work
with human subjects, you have to put the people at ease.
Some people appear perfectly natural for a picture, while
others are like marble statues. Still others are in-between,
needing encouragement anywhere from gentle prodding
to full-fledged professional entertainment from you,
the photographer. If you’re lucky enough to have a
subject who knows how to model, go with the flow
and give input as to what you want, also.
Sure, sometimes you just want a simple portrait
photo to record your visit somewhere — you know,
with people posed, smiling, in front of an interesting
building, monument, or fountain. Although these can be
great shots that create memorable moments, they’re prob-
ably not what you’d sell in an art gallery or put on display in
a museum. Creating art portraits, though, requires a little fore-
thought and creativity, whether you’re on the road or in your own back-
yard. As I show you in this chapter, you can create portraits of people by
playing with backdrops, posing your subjects (or not), and showing folks
involved in an activity to highlight their personalities.

138
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
You can use a lot of these same techniques when creating portraits of animals,
too. Okay, getting some animals to smile is a little tricky (alligators are easier
than butterflies), but here I show you some artful ways to capture Fido and
Fluffy and wild critters, too.
To help move your portraiture shots from the everyday toward art photos,
read about shooting with the art elements mentioned in Chapter 1 in your
shots. As an art photographer, you’ll probably have subjects in mind who are
not your friends or family when you go on a photography exhibition — say,
when you’re traveling to another country.
Photographing People
When you think of photographing people, you probably have the standard
smiling portrait/head shot in mind,
kind of like what you expect for a
yearbook. “Tilt your head a little to
the left. Now lift your chin a bit.
That’s it, perfect! Now smile!” Not
that anything is wrong with this tra-
ditional type of portraiture, but with
a little creativity, you can create 
portraits of people and non-living
“people” with a decided art photog-
raphy twist.
Whether photographing humans or
animals, the trick is to keep the tech-
nology as transparent as possible.
You get the best shots when your
subjects are as relaxed and natural
as possible (see Figure 7-1); you can
tell right away in any shot when the
subject is uncomfortable. (Think
about going to the dentist, and how
he conveniently places those shiny
tools out of your eyesight while he’s
doing his thing. Smart.)
To help you be as nonintrusive as possible, try not to use a flash any more
than you have to. Obviously, sometimes you need the extra light, but using a
flash startles just about any subject. Remember, too, that your camera proba-
bly offers a red-eye reduction setting for the flash. Firing a preflash before
taking the actual photo constricts your subject’s pupils, helping prevent that
spooky glowing red-eye problem.
Figure 7-1: Relaxed subjects make for a nice
photo.

The light from your flash dissipates the
farther your subjects are from it.
When shooting groups of people, a
flash doesn’t always give you uniform
illumination. Take a look at the picture
shown in Figure 7-2. Because the sub-
jects aren’t the same distance from the
flash, they’re not evenly lit.
You can also reduce how intrusive you
are (as a photographer) by getting
closer with zoom lenses, which are
helpful when filming athletes, people
on stage, and animals. Most digital
cameras have an optical zoom, which is a zoom made by adjusting your lens
that yields no loss of quality of your image. This is the only zoom you want to
use on your digital camera.
Don’t use your digital zoom because you can do the same thing in Photoshop,
which does a better job of interpolating the pixels when a picture is enlarged.
Traditional posed portraits
Probably the most traditional portrait is a head shot, in which you usually
film your subject from a relatively close distance, capturing her from mid-
chest-level up, paying attention to her face. However, before you begin to
take a posed art portrait, pay attention to the background for your shot.
There’s nothing worse than a spot-on portrait with a jarring or junky back-
ground. (No one wants their portrait to end up showing a tree growing out of
their head.) Of course, you can always use Photoshop to tweak an iffy back-
ground, but do what you can to get your shot right when you take it.
Second, decide how to light your subject (for more on lighting, see Chapter 6).
Finally, work to pose and stage your subject. To smile or not to smile?
139
Chapter 7: Photographing People and Animals
Figure 7-2: Subjects that aren’t the same
distance from the flash will be unevenly lit.
Optical versus digital zooms
Some digital cameras have digital zooms, which
in essence are zoom effects that have nothing to
do with your lens but everything to do with the
computer chip that calculates how your image
will look. It’s a setting that permits you to go past
what the optical zoom — the normal zoom that
your lens performs and one that is more natural
because there is no interpolation of missed
points — would give you. You can get an extra
magnification using this setting. You have to be
careful with it, though, because when you use
a digital zoom, you lose image quality.

140
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Using a backdrop
Way back when, you had to buy
expensive canvas to create a tradi-
tional drape backdrop for a portrait
(see Figure 7-3). If you go that route,
think about spending about $400 for a
10' x 10' canvas. To see what you can
get in terms of cloth and canvas back-
grounds, check out www.dennymfg.
com or www.amvona.com. For some-
thing more unusual, consider using a
mural or colorful prints as a backdrop.
You can, however, judiciously use a
nontraditional background to add
to the flavor of your portrait — for
example, filming a race car driver in
front of a back-and-white checkered
backdrop or a quilting fanatic in front
of a colorful coverlet.
Of course, you can create really cool
backgrounds digitally (via Photoshop)
by using your own photographs. Get
creative with your backgrounds by
shooting them separately from your
subjects and then layering them into
your photographs later in Photoshop.
You can choose anything you’ve taken a picture of, from a medieval wall to
glass blocks. However, the old-fashioned way (a backdrop) is still very effective
and (in some ways) less work then manipulating an image on your computer.

Who’s smiling now?
Take the classic da Vinci Mona Lisa portrait.
She’s not smiling. The masters Monet and Renoir
don’t have their subjects smiling, either. So what
goes with the not-happy face? The answer is
technology:
 People have to sit for long periods of time
while their portrait is painted. No one wants
to (or can) smile for a couple of hours on end.
 When photography was new, exposures
took several seconds or even minutes . . .
not as long as sitting for a portrait, but you
can’t expect people to hold a realistic smile
for that long.
 When exposure times shortened and people
didn’t have to pose as long, photographers
started having subjects smile.

Smile for the camera
People look more friendly and less
intimidating when they smile. And
because photographers (usually)
want their subject to appear in the
best possible light (pun intended),
they invariably asked posed people
to smile when being photographed.
Even though more people smile in
art these days (to see what I mean,
check out the sidebar, “Who’s smil-
ing now?”), a good smile is one 
that’s natural-looking and not forced.
Artists, whether window dressers or
masters of acrylics (a type of paint
an artist uses), want natural facial
expressions, including smiles, in
their art. Sometimes all it takes is
to say, “Smile,” and then snap your
camera to get your subject to smile
naturally, as in Figure 7-4.
As you likely know, getting a true smile on your subject can be a little tough.
Some people just plain freeze when being photographed. If you have a stiff
subject who is ill at ease with being photographed, telling a joke or riddle to
her can elicit a natural-looking smile.
For your more serious subjects
Face it, some people just don’t want to smile when getting their photograph
taken. Maybe they’re not the biggest yukster around (think pensive novelists),
maybe they’re embarrassed about their dental work, or perhaps they’re just
downright serious folk who want to be taken seriously (think businessmen or
politicians). And when you say, “Cheese!” or tell a joke to get people to smile,
you can catch some unflattering laugh lines or crows’ feet under the eyes,
making your subject appear older than he wants to. Whatever the reason,
insisting that someone smile who doesn’t want to will give you a forced,
unflattering portrait. Not what you or your subject wants. However, a non-
smiling portrait doesn’t have to be grim and boring. It can be dramatic, as in
Figure 7-5.
When faced with a serious-natured subject, let his wishes dictate how you
photograph him. If he wishes to appear a little gruff or dramatic, so be it.
That is, after all, part of his personality, which is what portraiture is all about.

subject.

Part II: The Photo Shoot

Figure 7-5: Use a non-smiling subject to create a serious and dramatic portrait. 

And sleeping subjects make for
excellent art photos. Of course,
unless your subject is having a most
wonderful dream, she won’t be smil-
ing. And not only is your subject
relaxed and peaceful, but you can
usually set your camera for a longer
exposure in low light. (You can risk
this longer exposure because your
subject isn’t moving terribly much.)
Personalizing a portrait
To help bring out your subject’s per-
sonality — and get them to lighten up
a tad — get your subject to do some-
thing or show you something that
they love, like a hobby or an avocation
(or vocation), like the young woman
shown in Figure 7-6. If you don’t know
your subject well, talk to him to find
out his interests: If he does yoga, ask
him to assume the lotus position for
a photo; if you come upon an artist
working, ask her if you can take a
picture of her doing her craft.
Depicting your subject’s personality
in the photo makes the photo more
personal to that person — which
obviously makes the photo more
appealing. If the subject — or mem-
ber of that person’s family — finds a
photo of himself or herself appealing,
you are more likely to have a sale.
Incorporating items that symbolize
something about that person’s inter-
ests or hobby or getting multiple
subjects to interact with one another
can make a good photo even better,
as shown in Figure 7-7.
Finding art in other features
Human portraiture doesn’t have to
be limited to faces. Any part of the
human form is fair game to show a
miniportrait, or piece, of your subject’s personality. Keeping these examples
family-friendly, shooting facial features or other body parts is a great way to

146
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
For art shots, consider honing in on these elements:
 Eye(s) and eyebrows
 Lips
 Facial lines
 Noses
 Hair and hairlines
 Hands and arms
 Legs and feet
Group portraits
When taking photos of groups, consider using the classic diamond pose. 
In a nutshell, the diamond pose involves posing subjects in groups of four,
placing one person in the center, two others to the left and right of — and
slightly behind — the center person, and finally the fourth directly behind
the center person, but elevated (so that you can see person #4!). The four
posed subjects make up the four points of a diamond: hence, the name.
For groups larger than four, start
with the diamond pose and then
cluster more diamond groups around
that initial one until everyone fits
in the frame. You might have to 
consider using a wide angle lens or
shooting from creative angles (such
as from above) to fit everyone in,
but this gets easier the more large
groups you photograph. Remember
that you can always go with a closer
shot when photographing groups
(you don’t always have to show
everyone’s legs, as shown in
Figure 7-10) and sometimes a nice
touch is to incorporate items that define the group, like sports equipment or
musical instruments.
For a better composition, have your subjects stand or sit without space
between them. They can be sitting adjacent or behind one another.

of a whole for a group shot.

Candid portraits
Some of the best portraits are
the informal — and sometimes
unplanned — ones. As I mention in
earlier sections, try to capture your
subject involved in activities that
interest her, keeping your eye alert
to elements to incorporate in the
shot to add visual appeal and depth.
Remember that life is spontaneous
and not all portraits have to be com-
posed and set up, like the one shown
in Figure 7-11.
Athletes can present you with great
candid photo opportunities. Take
advantage of showing them engaged
in an action integral to the sport:
serving in tennis, shooting close to
the hoop in basketball, hitting the
ball in baseball, and so on. (See what
I mean by looking at the image in the
nearby sidebar, “Drew Brashler:
Sports photographer, full digital
shooter.”) Just remember to keep
the focus on your subject. And don’t
overlook the opportunity, circum-
stances and decorum permitting, to
capture candid portraits of people
when they’re in less-than-optimal
moods. A photo capturing the tor-
ment of an angry toddler speaks 
volumes as does the angst of an 
athlete who didn’t perform well.
Train your eye to capture action at
its peak moment, when gravity is
most defied. This lad flying from a
swing seat (see Figure 7-12) will
always be airborne now in this
simple candid portrait.
Set your camera beforehand for action shots to help you shoot faster. Get as
close to your subject as you can, keeping your f-stop low (big aperture) — as
low as you can go on your camera (f/4.5 or lower).

Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Use the burst series of pictures, a setting available on some point-and-shoot
models. (Normally, point-and-shoot models aren’t as fast at shooting 
pictures as their dSLR and SLR counterparts.) The burst gives you the option
of taking a certain number of pictures (dependent on model) in quick succes-
sion (less than 2.4 frames per second. A Nikon D2H can shoot 8 frames per
second (fps), which is great for sports photographers who want to get all of
Drew Brashler: Sports photographer, 
full digital shooter
Mesa, Arizona-based freelance photographer
Drew Brashler looks through the lens of his Nikon
for action shots that capture goal-based play-
ers stoked at playing their game. He shoots with
a Nikon D1H (a pro dSLR) and Nikon AF 50mm
f1.8 and Nikon AF 80–200mm f2.8 lenses.
Comparing shooting film versus digital, Brashler
says, “For action, film doesn’t even compare
in my mind. For basketball, I shoot off about
115 to140 photos for one game. With film, to shoot
that much, I would have to change rolls three or
four times. And think about rewind times and
loading times. You would miss at least one main
play . . . probably two, if you weren’t quick.
“Now think of developing costs. That’s four rolls
of 36 (exposures), $10 each roll for developing.
That comes out to $40 plus sales tax. I’m a college
student, do most college students have that much
cash laying around each time a basketball game
happens?? No, because I go to Starbucks!
“Then there is the LCD screen. Being able to
look at your photos between plays is HUGE for
the starting-out photographer.” (This is called
chimping, thanks to www.sportsshooter.
com.) “Sports is all about timing. With an LCD
screen, you can look through your images and
find out whether you need to hold back before
pressing the button or be quicker at pressing
the button.
“Finally, the last thing is turnaround speed.
Every newspaper and Sports Illustrated have
had their photographers switch to digital. One
of the main reasons is the turnaround speed.
With digital, you can shoot up until 30 minutes
before a newspaper deadline to e-mail the
photos to the office and have the photo editor
edit the photos and turn them in for press. You
can’t do that with film: With film, you have to
process the film, and then make prints and scan
them, or just scan the negatives.”

the action in a short period of time. First set the
camera and then press the shutter halfway down
to set the autofocus and exposure for all the pic-
tures in the burst. Then press the shutter all the
way down and hold it to take several pictures
quickly.
Candid portraits don’t have to be of only one sub-
ject, either. An interaction between two people in a 
photograph makes the photo tell a story, even if
the interaction is as simple as two kids holding
hands. Figure 7-13 tells the story of two little girls
holding hands in friendship.
Capturing portraits of inanimate objects
For a little whimsy, don’t overlook the opportunity to capture portraits of
nonliving people — including statues, mannequins, murals, and art work —
as shown in Figure 7-14. You can even pair inanimate “people” with live ones
for a wonderfully artsy juxtaposition of realities. See Chapter 9 for more on
how to photograph statues in black and white. And one of this book’s bonus
chapters on the Web (see www.dummies.com) shows how to arrange photos
of statuary in a cohesive photo set.

Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Wildlife Portraiture
To capture portraits of favorite animals, the best place to go is to a zoo or an
aquarium or a circus. But there are other places, too, from private farms to your
own back yard, where wildlife abounds. Photo opportunities are different for
each, and each carries some precautions you’ll want to take before filming:
 The circus
• What works: Telephoto lenses (at least 105mm) and 400 ISO. Try to
shoot when the lights are up.
• Watch out for: Avoid using a flash so you don’t spook animals or
performers. And remember that the effective range of your flash
is likely only 10 or 12 feet.
• Make an art photo by: Filming a lion in a roar to show how big its
mouth is. Or zero in on one lion in the cage while blurring the
others for added dramatic effect. (See Chapter 11 for more about
intentional blurring for an added artistic edge.)
 The zoo
• What works: Use a tripod for steady shots. Use telephoto lenses
(at least 105mm) and 400 ISO.
• Watch out for: Waking nocturnal animals. Avoid using a flash so
you don’t spook animals. Also watch out for flash glare when
shooting in front of plate
glass exhibit windows.
(And, must I add — don’t
go beyond the exhibit 
barriers!)
• Make an art photo by:
Shooting a giraffe up close
so that the “animal por-
trait” is also a study in tex-
ture and pattern, as in
Figure 7-15. Other ways
might include shooting at
night with longer expo-
sures, shooting wide
angle, or capturing comfy
sleeping animals.
Photo credit: Timothy K. Hamilton
Figure 7-15: Zoom in, and an animal portrait
becomes a study in texture.

 Out and about (your own backyard, on the street, in a park)
• What works: Everyone has animals in their yard or at the local
park. If you’re a city dweller, you likely have horse police patrols or
pigeons on the roof. Time permitting, use a tripod for steady shots.
Use telephoto lenses (at least 105mm) and 400 ISO.
• Watch out for: Be quick on the shutter draw. Critters move fast, so be
alert. Set your camera to
auto mode after every shot.
Don’t try to handle animals
you don’t know or know
much about. Squirrels are
indeed cute, but they pack
some nasty teeth. Avoid
using a flash so you don’t
spook animals.
• Make an art photo by:
Capturing animals in black-
and-white (as shown in
Figure 7-16) to evoke 
emotion, or a pet doing
a trick (for an example,
check out Figure 7-18 in
the upcoming section,
“Pet Portraiture”).
Pet Portraiture
When you create portraits of animals, remember that safety comes first —
especially if you’re in the wild, pho-
tographing animals in their habitat.
If an animal you don’t know senses
that you’re uncomfortable or fright-
ened of it — for even one moment —
the charm can go very quickly.
If Fido is a black blur tearing after
his fave Frisbee (or postal carrier),
show off his speed by blurring the
background during an action scene,
like when he’s running (as shown
in Figure 7-17). When you capture
151

compelling.
Figure 7-17: Pan your camera for blur.

152
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
something fast-moving with the action setting
on any camera, the aperture tightens, so that
everything is clear. That’s not what you want
for this effect. Rather, to blur the background,
manually set the shutter speed to 1⁄30 second in
your camera’s Tv mode, the mode that lets you
set the shutter speed while your camera sets the
f-stop. (Note that the Tv mode might not be avail-
able on non-dSLR cameras.) Then move your
camera to mirror the animal’s direction and
speed (panning) while you make the exposure.
If Fido is the type of dog who loves to jump high
in the air after a toy (like a Frisbee), photograph-
ing him clearly with a blurred background may
require that you take many shots. It’s great fun
though to see your pet gliding through the air
with the greatest of ease. See Figure 7-18.
Remember, too, that not all pets have personalities
that are action-oriented. Take a look at Figure 7-19,
which you might consider to be “pet as still life.”
And as I mention in an earlier section about film-
ing sleeping animals in a zoo, don’t overlook the
opportunities a sleeping pet gives you. Except for
an occasional twitching leg, you’re guaranteed that
Fluffy will be still. You can also do some wonderful
up-close studies of their fur.

Goin’ bananas
The cute primates eating banana pieces are on top of a cab on the
way back from the ruins in Angkor Wat, Cambodia. Photographing
them did indeed get dicey. They made themselves quite at home
inside the car, making the photographer more than a little ner-
vous. As cute as any animal is, wild animals are just that — wild.
Photograph with care, not petting nor feeding nor handling wild
animals.

Shooting for Color in 
Art Photography
In This Chapter
 Understanding the relationship between light and color
 Discovering how your camera handles light and color

 Trying advanced color techniques
A
fter cracking groggy eyes in the morning, you notice rays of dusty light
sweeping across your bed. You watch as the tiny specks of debris scat-
ter about, floating aimlessly. You cough. Outside your window is a bright red
cardinal among maple leaves, motionless for the moment. You grab
your camera and snap. You captured the bright red bird in all its
grandeur. It flies away. You are happy with your shot, and
you go back to sleep. Later, when you upload your picture
to your computer, you find that the crimson bird is now
maroon with blue tones, and the green of the maple
leaf background is olive brown. The bird doesn’t
even look like a cardinal. What went wrong?
Taking an art photo is more than just snapping pic-
tures of flowers or birds. Shooting for explosive
color — from cool blue hues to melting reds — is
one of your major goals. Then you can take that color
to its brightest, boldest, softest, or smoothest image in
your shot (all the way, even, to setting your shadows
and colors in Photoshop).
In this chapter, I give you the lowdown on shooting photos in color —
bright vibrant colors — from the basics of understanding color to more
advanced techniques that you can implement to take great photos. As Paul
Simon says, “Don’t take my Kodachrome away.”

154
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
The techniques presented here are a guide for creating something worthy of
wall space at your home or at someone else’s, a spectacular framed print for
a gift or to sell. Or maybe a high-resolution JPEG submission to your favorite
travel mag or one of the dozens of new photography and literary publications
making their way to newsstands and bookstores everywhere.
Discovering How Light Makes Color
Simple light and color principles form a basis for producing a wide range
of photography, from aesthetically appealing shots to those of outrageous
pop — ones that people pay dollars, euros, and yen for (pun intended).
Color comes in three primary shades:
red, yellow, and blue. On a printed or
painted picture, these colors’ reflec-
tion of light on white paper to your
eye offsets the colors to yellow,
cyan, and magenta. Combining two
primary colors — say blue and
yellow — results in a secondary
color: in this case, green. Mixing a
primary and a secondary color
forms a tertiary color. Blue (primary)
and green (secondary), for example,
make bluish-green (tertiary). Fig-
ure 8-1 shows the added colors of
tints (made by adding white to colors)
and the shades (made by adding
black to them).
Different types of materials and objects reflect different wavelengths of light.
And the wavelength of that reflected light defines the color. Understanding
color is critical to creating good shots because, after all, photography is all
about writing with light.
This short exercise can help you see how light changes color:
1. Place an object under ample light.
If you need, augment the light, such as setting a dimmer switch to maxi-
mum intensity.
2. Take a picture of the object.
3. Dim the light a little, watch what happens to the light reflected from
the object, and take another picture of the object.
4. Repeat Steps 1–3 a few times.

5. Compare the pictures to see how the different light changes the
appearance of the object.
The object changes its hue or tone as the light varies. When the room
darkens, black is added to the color. Red, for example, changes to

Figure 8-2 shows comparative pictures of a toy snake, each taken in manual
mode at a shutter speed of 8 seconds and an f-stop of f/16. (For more about
shutter speed and f-stops, see Chapter 5.) Before each shot was taken, I
reduced the amount of available light by turning down the dimmer switch
in the room. Notice the change of tones in the colors.

Light and color, which are both fluid and manageable most of the time, are
the elements that make or break a good photograph. Throughout this sec-
tion, I explain what you must know about color, how light affects color, and
some basics about using color to make wonderful photos.

Chapter 8: Shooting for Color in Art Photography
Keeping an eye on color
Look at the colors around you while waiting in
line at the grocery store or sitting in traffic. Ask
yourself the following:
 Does the color of the object tell a story?
 Has the color of an object faded to a shade
you’ve never seen before?
 Has someone painted something a color so
bad that it’s good?
 Do the colors you see provoke an extended
emotion or feeling that you wouldn’t nor-
mally associate with that object?
If you answered yes to any of these questions,
quick, grab your camera and take a picture of it.
It could be an art photo.

156
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Positioning yourself and your camera
Choosing objects to photograph in color requires that you be selective
about how and where you aim your camera. To balance ambient lighting,
you might need to shift your body position, sometimes dancing about the
object to get the right light. As you move to the left or right or up or down,
the object takes on different hues because light bounces off it in a variety of
directions.
In your effort to capture the world around you as a work of art, your goals are
to eliminate glare, iron out streaks, and minimize shadows. Especially when
shooting outdoors (more on that in Chapter 5), you must move around an
object to find the light that’s just right. Do a few stretches and then follow
these steps:
The mood mix
How would a cowboy look dressed in green? Or
a sea adventure movie preview blaring on a
movie screen in pink? Colors come in all kinds of
hues and tones, from primary colors mixed with
white (the pastels) to blazing primary colors that
pop artist Keith Haring included in his graffiti.
Each makes you feel something and each
makes an association with your viewer, joining
the two of you in what you know about color.
Greens and blues are cool and calming. Grays
and browns are dull and uneventful (but they
match well with other colors). Reds and oranges
are warm and inviting. 
And wait — that’s not all. There are light colors,
the pure ones, that make you feel happy. Haring’s
colors, bright and medium-toned, can give you
goose bumps from an invigorating mix of primary
red, green, and blue. And don’t forget the feel-
ings evoked by the dark tones of the big maroon
pencil you used when you were six and the deep
navy blue of the mid-ocean, which can be cool
and peaceful.
If you’re thinking about art to use indoors —
framed digital prints — think of colors and
mood. Use warm colors (coral and orange and
yellow) to add comfort to a cool, dark place. If
you live up north, make lots of art with warm
colors. People will love you for it in the winter. If
you’ve got lots of sun (say where I live in the
desert), go with some chilling blues. And if you
love Keith Haring, let out your inner child and
paint your digital pictures (like the one here),
leaving your inhibitions behind.

1. Choose an object that you want to 
photograph.
Don’t get stumped on this one. Just select
something with color (like the yellow tables
in Figure 8-3) or get anything colorful that
you can carry outside.
2. Focus on the object where the light is great-
est and snap a shot.
You might find yourself bending and contort-
ing your limbs in positions that you’re not
used to.
3. Photograph the same object in the same
light/location but now focus on different
light intensities around the object.
If you find that a lot of light on the center
of the object doesn’t give the enhanced
color effect that you want, move the object
(or yourself) to experiment.
4. Notice where the light falls to help you
choose the best color exposure.
Sometimes (like when photographing the cardinal
I describe earlier), you have but a small frame of
opportunity to catch the subject’s color. You
must be quick, simply taking your camera from
your nightstand and snapping a picture. To
achieve optimal color exposure, set your camera to a general automatic
mode (which I discuss further in Chapter 5) in case a photographic moment
presents itself on short notice.
Using complementary and contrasting colors
You have millions of ways to mix colors to create a mood. For instance, take
the bright colors of fast-food restaurants. The colors that corporations use to
sell fast food make you hungry, so you buy more food.
In order to make sense of color in a photo, apply what you know or see
around you. Look for complementary and contrasting colors, both in man-
made objects and in nature. You don’t want to precisely match colors, like the
dreaded bridesmaid syndrome of dyeing shoes to match the color of a dress.
157
Chapter 8: Shooting for Color in Art Photography

different angles causes subtle
color changes.

Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Complementing or contrasting color
is more on the order of choosing a
color range (family) or of finding a
snippet of color in two things: like
black shoes that go with an ensem-
ble of black-and-white houndstooth.
The boy’s shirt in Figure 8-4 comple-
ments the other earth-toned shades
surrounding him. Think of choosing
colors in a photograph in the same
terms as picking out clothes for an
outfit that you want to wear, or per-
haps you want your children to wear
for a big family event.
Nature provides rich opportunities
for capturing color. Think about how and why they look good. The colors in
the photo shown in Figure 8-4 complement each other because the boy wore a
seasonal color, perfect for taking art photos of him at the pumpkin farm. After
selecting certain objects to photograph, soon you’ll discover that keeping
within a range of colors is better than having your viewer take in a helter-
skelter range picked randomly from several objects that happen to be near
each other.
Also, while training your eye to work with color, notice how it sometimes tricks
the human eye. Figure 8-5 compares the contrast effects of different color back-
grounds for the same red square. Red appears more brilliant against a black
background and somewhat duller against the white background. In contrast
with orange, red appears lifeless; in contrast with blue-green, it exhibits bril-
liance and depth. Notice, too, that the red square appears larger on black
than on other background colors.
Figure 8-5: Background and foreground colors contrast differently, creating perceptual
differences.
If you are color-blind, don’t let that stop you from taking art photographs.
Think of it this way: People (designers and your potential subjects) have
taken the time to do your color-matching work for you. Fashion designers
mix colors to match the latest trends. They know what they are doing.
They’re trained in color theory, so that if you take a close-up shot of your
Aunt Bea in her new Chanel blouse, the color choices have already been
defined in the clothes themselves.
Figure 8-4: The colors here work because they
match.

Sign makers, architects, and artists
spend a lot of time making sure that
the colors they use work together.
For example, the sign in Figure 8-6
contains a mix of vibrant color, won-
derful by itself. The color of the
photo, however, is enhanced by the
magnificent blue sky behind it (thank
you, Mother Nature!).
To see what I mean:
1. Find a candy package in a col-
orful wrapper.
2. Set your (digital) camera to its
highest resolution, as discussed
in Chapter 2.
3. Put the package under a lamp,
position the package for the
light that you want on it, and
take a picture of the package.
4. Take other pictures of the package from different angles and under
different light sources.
My candy company of choice uses a striped background on the
wrapper — one that, when
snapped as a close-up and
printed out at high resolution,
literally glows on your (or some-
one else’s) wall.
Figure 8-7 shows two shots of part
of a candy wrapper: one shot
under tungsten light (on top) and
one shot under a fluorescent light.
I shot these at different angles to
enhance the color differences
between the two.
Start capturing fantastic color with
close-ups of objects:
 A window display at a local shop
 A sports player in uniform
 A billboard
 A cluster of flowers

Part II: The Photo Shoot 
How Your Camera Interprets Light and Color
When you prepare your camera for taking a picture, you control the exposure,
or how much light is cast on the film (with a film camera) or on the sensor
(with a digital camera).
A shining sun, bright and unobstructed, is necessary to get the most
color on film or your digital camera’s sensor. If you set your camera to 
aperture-driven auto settings (see Chapter 5) so that the shutter speed is
automatically determined by your sensor, you do lose a bit of creative con-
trol regarding shooting for color. To maximize color on a sunny day, you
need to factor in
 ISO/ASA: How sensitive the film/sensor is to light; often called the film
speed. Film speed is a measure of light sensitivity. When using fast film
speeds, you can take a picture inside with less light (with the result of a
loss of color). A slow film speed allows objects to get “soaked” — that is,
saturated — with light and color. (Although ISO and ASA are similar, ASA
value is based on an American standard and ISO on an international
standard.)
The film speed for a digital camera is a measure of how much light it
needs to take a well-exposed photo. (Obviously, a digital camera doesn’t
use traditional celluloid and emulsion film, per se, like an SLR or a view
camera does.) Usually, film speed for a digital camera is stated as an ISO
equivalency (light sensitivity expressed in the terms used to rate the
same characteristic in film). Bonus: When you set the ISO for a film
camera, you are stuck with that setting for the entire roll of film. For a
digital camera, however, you can change the ISO for every exposure if
you want.
• Low ISO: A low ISO setting (50–200) generally produces better,
cleaner images, but the pictures can be dark if not shot in bright
sunlight or with a good flash. Images are also more susceptible to
blurring because of the slower shutter speeds required when using
a low ISO setting.
• High ISO: Higher ISO settings (400–1600) can produce better-
exposed pictures in low light but also introduce more electronic
noise, or pixel distortion, which can make your image look grainy.
Noise has been significantly reduced in high-end digital cameras
when you shoot at high ISO; when you change ISO settings, there’s
no longer a discernable difference between high and low ISOs in
some shots.

Figure 8-8 shows pictures
taken with a Canon 350
dSLR camera, handheld
indoors without a flash at
ISO settings of 100 and
1600. Notice that the pic-
ture on the left in the figure
is clear — and on the right,
blurry. Low ISO settings are
more sensitive to camera
shake.
For a clear, colorful shot, set
your camera to a high ISO
indoors. At settings such as 1600
or 3200, you can shoot in dark
cathedrals — or even in a cave lit by flashlight. However, you can expect
a lot of digital noise when shooting at such high ISO settings.
 Shutter speed: This is the actual amount of time that the camera’s shut-
ter remains open. The longer the shutter is open, the more light that
falls on the sensor or film. (When the shutter is open too long and too
much light enters the camera, the image is overexposed and looks pale
and washed out. When the shutter isn’t open long enough and not enough
light enters the camera, the image is underexposed and appears too dark.)
 f-stop: A measure that indicates the size of the lens opening (aperture).
The value of an f-stop is inversely proportional to the opening of the
lens. Smaller values such as f/2.8–6.3 mean that your lens is open wide,
letting in more light in a given amount of time (the shutter speed). Larger
f-stop numbers, such as f/18–36, create a smaller aperture, thus letting in
less light at the same shutter speed.
As you take more and more pictures using aperture-driven auto settings, keep
these points in mind (and see Chapter 6 for more information):
 Have your camera preset to the Av mode, which is a feature that lets you
set the f-stop number and automatically maintain correct exposure as
the camera adjusts the shutter speed. Set your f-stop to around f/6.7 to
f/8 (a moderate setting that will give you decent depth of field) and begin
shooting. Use a lower f-stop to keep the subject in focus while gently
blurring the rest of the image. Use a higher f-stop to keep the entire
image in sharp focus. See what I mean in Figure 8-9.
 Choose a position to shoot where the background of the shot is the least
cluttered and offers good contrast with the object itself.

Figure 8-8: Use a high ISO to eliminate blur in
low light.

162
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
When in Av mode, the smaller your aperture is set, the longer your shutter
has to stay open so that at very high f-stops (say, f/36), you get blur very
easily because your shutter has to stay open longer than your subject can
stay still.

Figure 8-9: Widening your aperture decreases depth of field.
Setting ISO speed for maximum color
The first thing that you do as a film photographer before a shoot is decide
what kind of film you will use: That is, choose the film’s sensitivity to light.
You can purchase film with speeds from ISO 100 to ISO 800 at just about any
drug store around the world. Films with higher and lower ISOs are available
at specialty camera shops. Although digital photographers have a wider
choice in ISO settings (some digital cameras have lower and higher settings
than are commonly found with film), they can also set their ISO settings to
many of the same values used for film.
For the brightest, boldest colors, shoot with traditional high-resolution film
and scan those images or shoot with your digital camera set at a lower ISO
value.
Setting your digital camera to a film speed greater than ISO 400 or shooting
with film that’s over ISO 400 and scanning the prints or negatives/positives
sometimes results in noise, unwanted specks of red, green, or blue and unde-
sirable light specks in shadows and areas of solid color.

Noise isn’t always bad. In fact, some-
times it’s preferred to achieve a cer-
tain effect, as shown in Figure 8-10,
which features a shot of a French
town taken through a plane window
on the way to Paris. Here, noise
makes the photo look almost like a
pointillist painting.
Setting white balance
Color exists in various proportions in any lighting situation. Its hue, tone, and
intensity depends upon ambient light, or lighting that seems to come from all
directions (rather than from a single source) and fills a scene, shedding light
on the objects you’re photographing. Your camera measures ambient light
with a value known as color temperature. Essentially, color temperature is the
blueness or orangeness of the light that you see.
Color temperature variances can be corrected by covering your lens with a
filter, offsetting odd-colored tones that are created by ambient light. For exam-
ple, with a conventional film camera, you need to use a skylight filter, one that
reduces the blue tones that occur at high color temperatures. While your dig-
ital camera likely has both automatic and manual white balance settings, you
may still find the need (or desire) to use photographic filters in front of your
lens. Your white balance choice may include Daylight, Shade (or Cloudy),
Fluorescent, and Incandescent (or Tungsten). Generally speaking, you’ll leave
your camera set to Auto, but there may be times that you want to use an incor-
rect white balance setting for special effects. You might, for example, make a
snow scene bluer by taking the photo with white balance set to Incandescent/
Tungsten. Or you might want to make an indoor fireplace or candle scene
seem even warmer and cozier by shooting with white balance set to Daylight.
Knowledge of color temperature with
respect to your white balance set-
tings can ensure that you get the
optimum color results because ambi-
ent light has a color temperature
value. Different light sources emit
light at different color temperatures,
causing your picture to lean either to
a red or blue hue. A high color tem-
perature shifts light toward blue (as
in Figure 8-11), and a low color tem-
perature shifts light toward red hues
(as in Figure 8-12).
163
Chapter 8: Shooting for Color in Art Photography
Figure 8-10: Noise comprises tiny dots that can
appear at high ISOs.
Figure 8-11: When color temperature is high,
more blue light exists.

164
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Figure 8-12: When color temperature is low, like in a production, more red light exists.
Tweaking white balance settings also enables you to deceive your camera
into giving you results that will enhance your images. Toying with your white
balance settings can turn deserts into icy retreats, prickly and cold, or set
the indoors afire with a global warming–like result — color science that
makes art “art.”
Take some time and play around with your camera’s white balance settings
adding warmth (by increasing reds) or coolness (by increasing blue) when
you’re photographing in daylight. You’ll need only a little while to determine
your favorite settings to fool — I mean, set — your camera. Figure 8-13 illus-
trates the relationship between sources of light and color temperature, showing
how the color temperature changes with different ambient light around your
subject/scene.

Excel chart created by Matt Bamberg.
Figure 8-13: Low color temperatures (indoors) appear with red hues; high color temperatures
(outdoors) appear with blue hues.
If you set the camera to a shade white balance while taking a picture in broad
daylight, your digital camera adds more red tones into the scene. Check the
Kelvin color temperature chart (refer to Figure 8-13) to see that overcast 
conditions are about 6000° K. Light shade conditions are about 7100° K.
Therefore, setting your white balance to Shade adds more red tones than 
setting your camera to Overcast when you shoot in daylight. Some digital
cameras allow you to enter the Kelvin temperature for your white balance so
that you have maximum control over the amount of red or blue tones that
you add to your shot.

Part II: The Photo Shoot 
The Auto White Balance (AWB) mode on your camera uses its sensors to cal-
culate the white balance for the image. Usually, the Kelvin (K) temperature
range for AWB is 3000–7000° K. Using AWB normally provides a good image
albeit with some color temperature distortion that you see with film — for
example, the same blues and reds as seen in Figures 8-11 and 8-12, respectively.
Warmer light of sunrise yields to the cooler light of midmorning. After twilight,
when light dims, conditions for shooting change fast. Now is when your ISO
should drop to capture better color in your shots.
If you’re shooting where shadows
abound, or perhaps the sun is in front
of you, you’ll need to manually adjust
your camera’s exposure or you may
have trouble with your images when
you go to edit. Lackluster colors,
washed with black, are likely to
appear. These are colors that won’t
budge from stubborn hues; they’re
unmanageable and easily pixilated,
even when you’re using the best tools
that Photoshop has to offer. The pink
Cadillac in Figure 8-14 isn’t done jus-
tice in this shot. Because the camera adjusted itself to avoid overexposing
the sky in the background, the subject of the photo is too dark. Manually set-
ting the camera to a larger aperture and a slower shutter speed could have
produced a lovely photo.
For the most natural color results in a picture taken with a digital camera, set
the white balance indoors to your digital camera’s indoor (incandescent or
fluorescent) setting. If you’re shooting outdoors in the shade, set it to the
Shade/Overcast setting.
Setting your digital camera to automatic is your best bet because if you go to
photograph a crimson cardinal outside your window without having changed
the white balance from your last (indoor) shot to either automatic or daylight,
your picture will be a throw-away.
The film for a traditional camera and the sensor for a digital camera are opti-
mized for daylight color temperature. Whether you use film and then digitize
your negatives, or shoot a picture using the sensor on a digital camera, your pic-
ture will edge to one hue or the other (blue or red) as your light source varies
unless the white balance setting is adjusted, either automatically or manually.
Experimenting with settings can create interesting effects — effects that
people might just buy and hang on their walls. If you’ve made a mistake but
find your image looking good, don’t dump it. It could be a valuable print.
Fortunately, when you manipulate your image in Photoshop, tweaking your
picture to normal color levels is fairly easy — and by normal, I mean the
levels that your eye would see.
Figure 8-14: Dark hues hide colors.

Using an f-stop to Enhance Color
I believe that good color photography begins with a bright sunny day. Some
think that the best time to photograph is during fog because objects are
muted and shadows disappear. However, direct sunlight on an object distin-
guishes its color, which produces a bold-colored image. Light, ever changing
and unpredictable, is what makes or breaks a good color shot. Keep in mind
that some people — that is, your potential clients — buy bold and bright colors.
(That’s not to say that there isn’t a market for black-and-white photography
or even color images with more subdued colors, but the bold and bright
shots are easily marketed.)
To use the sun to your advantage and produce photos with eye-popping
color, go outside on a sunny day. With the light behind you (move a little if
you cast a shadow over your subject), take several photos of one object. I
feel that the best light for a color art photo is direct sunlight on the object

Chapter 8: Shooting for Color in Art Photography
The beauty of simplicity
in color
Santorini, Paros, and Mykonos are Greek beach-
bumming heavens, but you can also find a pho-
tographer’s paradise in Greece. A mix of the
Greek summer sun, the ubiquitous stucco walls,
and the soft Mediterranean colors combine for
some of the greatest photo ops in the world. Add
in smooth arches and a couple of beveled edges,
and you’re almost in photography heaven. What
finishes it off is the blue sky that curves through to
perfect the composition.
A photographer’s job is to capture the beauty
of the simplicity of colors around us — to make
us aware of things we might not notice. So
take the time to look around and see what others
might not.

168
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
being photographed, as in Figure 8-15.
Whether you’re shooting billboards
in Havana or flowers in your garden,
each will make a unique photo when
the sun hits your subject directly. If
the sun isn’t where you want, move
around the object until you see it
reflecting the most light. If the object
is small enough, move it in front of
you with the sun at your back. If
you’re in a hurry — say if the object
is borrowed from a shop after asking
the owner for permission to photo-
graph it — use the same f-stop set-
ting each time. Hint: Using f/6.7 is
excellent for flat objects that have
direct sunlight on their faces. 
For more about shooting photos outdoors, see Chapter 5.
Finding objects in direct sunlight and photographing them is a great way to
make a set of images that contain bright colors. For more on shooting in
shade, see the upcoming section, “Shooting colors in the shade.”
Advanced Color Techniques
In traditional photography, your goal might be to create a print of realistic
impression of what you see. In art photography, however, colors (like other
subjects and elements) can either be exaggerated or subdued in a wide vari-
ety of ranges: You can underexpose to saturate color, shoot in the shade, or
even use pollution to your advantage.
Underexposing your photo to enhance color
Heavy overexposure will lighten your print and move your colors to white.
Underexposing, conversely, tends to work in an opposite manner, ranging
from deepening colors to blacking out your entire photo.
All cameras, digital and film, rely on their light meter to measure the light
around the lens and within the frame of your shot. For ordinary exposures,
most cameras use an average of all the light that the frame has in it.
However, using an average of all the light in your frame sometimes just doesn’t
do the job of reproducing the bright colors in the frame. You have to help it
along by using the exposure compensation settings that allow you to take in
more or less light in your frame. When you reduce the amount of light that
you let in the camera, you deepen the colors of the image. Tauntingly deep
colors can attract potential buyers of your photos.
Figure 8-15: A bloom directly in the sun makes
a great subject.

Play with these setting to see which work best for your shots. You can over-
ride how your camera exposes your
film or the sensor to light. You can
lighten or darken the image by using
the EV (exposure value) compensa-
tion, using positive and negative
fractional numbers in decimal form,
like +1.0 or –0.5.
Decreasing the exposure by 0.5
(depending on the brightness of the
sun) will do a much better job of sat-
urating colors in your image than
waiting to do it in Photoshop later.
You can never have enough flowers
in your life, especially when it comes
to fooling around with your exposure
compensation settings. (Come to
think about it, you can never have
enough insects and butterflies and
animals and light and color, too.)
1. Find some flowers in your
garden to photograph, making
sure the flowers have the sun
shining directly on them.
2. Set your camera to the Av set-
ting with your f-stop set at your
choice.
Remember that you’re exper-
imenting only with color
enhancement and not depth
of field.
3. Set your exposure compensa-
tion at –0.5 to underexpose the
shot so that the colors appear
more saturated.
4. Take a close-up picture of the
flowers.
5. Repeat at an exposure compen-
sation setting of –1.0.
Figure 8-16 shows how shots taken at
different exposure compensations
(0, –.66, and –1.33, top to bottom)
bring out the color of flowers.
169
Chapter 8: Shooting for Color in Art Photography
Figure 8-16: Change exposure compensation to
deepen colors.

170
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Some art photography provides viewers with a clear focus of an object or a
part of an object, like this bridge in Hanoi, Vietnam (see Figure 8-17). The color
red among the contrasting green background of foliage and water provides a
clear focus based upon color. The f-stop was set high so that the picture has
a clear foreground and background. The exposure compensation was set to –.5,
making the colors appear saturated.
Figure 8-17: Underexposing the shot slightly helps saturate the red of the bridge.
The rules for shooting for color are changing with the new Raw formats that
are available on dSLR cameras. Even if you didn’t saturate your colors while
you were shooting, you can later — in Photoshop — just as if you were shoot-
ing. In your software, you can simply increase the saturation value with a
slider. For more about this, see Chapter 12.
If this morning’s cardinal came back at noon and the sun was shining brightly
on it, the chances are great that the red of his feather coat would scream
loudly off of a printed page, almost pop-like. You’ll be lucky if you get time to
adjust your exposure compensation in time to photograph it in the deep reds
that you would hope to get. If your specialty is photographing wildlife in deep
colors, you might want to have your camera preset to your favorite exposure
compensation setting.
In Av (automatic) mode, if your f-stop is high (for a clear background and great
depth of field) in a lower light environment, you risk blurring your picture
because your camera will automatically decrease the shutter speed.

Shooting colors in the shade
Tall downtown buildings, trees
with wide girths, and very cloudy
days — all casting shadows over
your world — can turn photo oppor-
tunities from glamorous to pitiful.
Shade can present a challenge when
trying to capture color. However, you
can use shade to your advantage,
especially when contrasting bright
and shadowed areas, such as you
see in Figure 8-18. Also note in the
figure that even the shady area has
variations — some areas are darker
than others.
Varying light, whether in sun or shade,
can make a shot more interesting.
When the sun pours on the green,
that’s a perfect time to underexpose
a shot by –0.5. When you underex-
pose, sunlit green won’t be dull, but
vibrant and verdant.
When you make colors vibrant, how-
ever, watch out for the shadows and shady spots that abound because these
will turn even darker when you underexpose.
Think of shade as a kind of mini-night: a time when color is blackened.
Keeping your shutter open longer (a slower shutter speed) solves some of
the light problems that you may have with shade. To fool the camera into
exposing the scene a little longer, use your camera’s Manual mode, keep the
same f-stop, and slightly increase the time the shutter is open. Using a tripod
will help to eliminate blur that tends to creep in when you make a handheld
exposure with a longer exposure time.
When taking a photo that includes areas both sunny and shady, you should
consider using your camera’s spot metering mode (if offered). This enables
you to designate which part of the image should be properly exposed.
(With some cameras, you point the camera at the area you want the camera
to consider for setting the exposure, press the shutter button halfway down,
and then reframe the shot before taking the photo.) Remember, too, that
when shooting a subject in the shade with a bright background, you can set
your camera to fire the flash (force flash) to illuminate the subject. You’ll hear
the term “fill flash” used for this technique.

Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Although you’d generally avoid taking photos where the same object is half in
the shade and half in the sun, always look for those special opportunities to
exploit the juxtaposition of very different lights and how they create color.
Color and the atmosphere
Color changes according to the light available, which in turn is affected by
environmental variables and atmospheric conditions, including pollution,
haze/fog, the season, and time/temperature of day.
Generally, the more polluted the sky is, the less intense the sun will be. Not
only is there less contrast from the surface of an object to a background of
smog, but you also end up with pixel separation of the browns and blues
when your picture is digitized and enlarged.
On a sunny day in an area with heavy air pollution, haze on the horizon is
likely. You might find this to be distracting or even that it ruins what could be
an otherwise beautiful image. The more the light is scattered by air pollution,
the poorer your color saturation can be.
Although mastery of your photo editing software can salvage quite a few mar-
ginal (or even potentially great) photos, you want to shoot under the best
conditions possible for the subject you’re capturing. When given a choice
between hanging out until the light is right or spending hours in Photoshop
correcting an image, sit tight (or chill out) until conditions are perfect. And
then take lots of photos with a variety of settings to ensure you have the best
shot possible.

Crafting a Quality 
Black-and-White 
Art Photo
In This Chapter
 Why you should consider black-and-white (B&W) photography
 Shooting in B&W
 Noticing the differences between film and digital camera images
 Mastering shadows, midtones, and highlights
 Using lighting to make great B&W images
E
ver been to a gallery or a museum exhibit that shows only
black-and-white (B&W) photographs? B&W photogra-
phy shows happen all the time from small coffee shops
in small towns to big shows in big cities — shows such
as the photography of Garry Winogrand, who pho-
tographed the streets of America throughout his 
lifetime during the last century. (See the sidebar
on Winogrand’s work later in this chapter.)
And although digital photography does affect how
black-and-white images look, this newer technology
won’t kill its kindred and traditional B&W art form
because there are more ways than ever to compose,
capture, and manipulate those subtle shades of gray
into images that mesmerize and captivate. Of course, you
can always convert an existing color shot to B&W (see the
“Manipulating a color image to become B&W” section, later in this chapter),
but when you want B&W, shoot in B&W.

174
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Shooting B&W is a serious form of art photography. Some people tend to dis-
miss B&W as boring or somehow less artsy because — face it — there’s no
color! However, there are plenty of markets for your B&W art photos, from
galleries to museums to photojournalism to portraiture and architecture
shots. In this chapter, I give you the basics of B&W digital photography and
printmaking, whether you’re shooting film or digital.
Why Shoot in Black-and-White?
So you think that B&W is boring? Sure, who wouldn’t rather have a color
TV than one in B&W? Who wouldn’t rather look at color photos than plain
ol’ B&W? And hardly anyone bothers to film movies in B&W anymore.
Still, B&W has never gone out of vogue for certain practical applications,
such as capturing architecture and architectural detail (see Figure 9-1), 
products for publications, and photojournalism. And from an artistic 
perspective, using B&W can afford you very dramatic prints, especially
in portraiture (including when shooting sculptures) and when capturing
shadows.
Figure 9-1: B&W is the workhorse for filming lines, light, and shadow.
After all, to shoot in B&W is to master light and shadow — which is what pho-
tography is all about. In short, to shoot in B&W is to shoot with an art focus

of drama (see Figure 9-2). Also, using
B&W can lend a warm feeling of 
nostalgia.
B&W images can comprise many
shades of gray. Read more about grays
in the upcoming section, “Under-
standing the 256 shades of gray.”
From an educational standpoint,
mastering shooting in B&W is the
training ground for serious photogra-
phers. When you shoot in B&W, you
train your eye to read light and not
be so distracted by the additional
layer of color in our surroundings
that you automatically and uncon-
sciously process. Study the great
photographers of yesteryear and
today — Ansel Adams, Alfred
Eisenstaedt, Alfred Stieglitz,
Dorothea Lange, Henri Cartier-
Bresson, and Diane Arbus, to name
only a handful — to see how they were masters of B&W.

Chapter 9: Crafting a Quality Black-and-White Art Photo
Digital black-and-whites and your friendly 
neighborhood museum curator
Most modern art museums do accept digitally
manipulated images, but only if there’s a certain
“wow” factor. Brilliantly colored nighttime prints
(in which the shutter of the photographer’s
camera has been left open) or prints for which
the photographer risked life and limb to obtain
(climbing tall buildings for unusual perspectives,
for instance) seem to forever attract curators.
Museum curators and high-end gallery owners
accept digital photos in the context of larger art
pieces and installations — say, a video made up
of elaborately connected digital images.
You can create the building blocks of more elabo-
rate works and use B&W as your colors of choice,
but getting into a museum requires that you use
your imagination to create prints that work
together with other media and/or multimedia —
from collages to MPEGs (files of moving pic-
tures on the computer).
Check out the Digital Art Museum’s Web site at
dam.org to view the latest in digital art forms.
Many B&W digital photographs by the artists on
this site are part of larger art installations and
multimedia projects. (This Web site also gives
viewers an excellent overview of the history of
computer art.)

Part II: The Photo Shoot 
A brief B&W perspective
B&W photography is an aberration in art history.
Before the advent of the pinhole camera, visual
art images — more specifically, paintings — in
galleries or museums were in color.
At one time, though, B&W photography was
modern — the technology of its day. It was even
portable, although photographers had to lug
around bulky equipment and make their own
exposure plates (what we take for granted as
“film” today). And the results were quite exciting
for the times, allowing everyday folks to see
images of faraway and exotic locales as well as
being able to obtain affordable portraits and
other photographs, as shown in Figure 9-3 
(compared with the luxury of a painted portrait).
Too, the advent of a portable camera launched
photojournalism.
With the growing acceptance of photography as
an art form throughout the 19th century, some
came to find that the B&W images were actually
more artistic and intellectually challenging than
paintings, in which viewers didn’t have to imag-
ine nature’s colors.
With the advent of color film, though, B&W fell
out of favor with some. People wanted this new
technology and the more realistic images intrin-
sic to color photography. Naturally, because
color processing was more costly and because
color photo technology was new, B&W photogra-
phy was considered by some as a poor man’s
photo option.
Shooting architecture
Towering buildings, old forts, walls of steel and glass . . . man-made structures
of our modern world stun in real life — and can in photographs, too, if you
take a few steps when setting your camera before taking architectural shots
in B&W.
1. Set your camera.
Figure 9-3: B&W was the start
of photography.

• Av mode: This is aperture priority. Set the aperture to f/16 or higher.
• A-DEP: The automatic depth of field mode is on the knob of the
Creative Zone on a number
of SLR and dSLR cameras
(see Chapter 11). The 
A-DEP setting allows you
to use multiple focusing
points within the frame to
keep everything in focus.
It uses a very fast shutter
speed on the order of the
inverse of several thou-
sand seconds (1⁄2000–1⁄4000)
and wide aperture open-
ings (f/4 to f/6).
2. Set your lens or zoom factor so
that your frame contains what
you want and no more.
For example, if you want to
show a towering building like
in Figure 9-4, either use a short
lens (a lens whose focal length
is shorter than the diagonal
length of your camera’s sensor)
or a fish-eye lens that captures
the entire structure (and possi-
bly some framing by other
structures nearby), or set an
adjustable lens to a wide angle
setting. For details about how
different lenses are calibrated
according to the size of your
sensor, see Chapter 2.
The wide angle on an adjustable lens
is when you “zoom out” so that the lens is set to the smallest focal length. 
Shooting things of an architectural nature don’t always mean filming tall
buildings. Just train your eye to look for structural details in all sorts of 
situations. To get your creative juices started, peruse the database at
www.archinform.net to see literally thousands of images of international
architecture, originally emerging from records of interesting buildings and
their details from past to present.

B&W.

Part II: The Photo Shoot 
To see how different the same piece of architecture looks in color compared
with B&W, see the juxtaposition in Figure 9-5 of a color and a B&W image
(converted to grayscale in Photoshop, in this instance, for the sake of com-
parison) of the same architectural shot. (Nice juxtaposition, too, of old and
modern architectural styles.) Both give a different effect and feeling.
Figure 9-5: The same shot looks very different in color versus B&W.
 The color photo reveals the warm hues of sepia along with the creation
of finer detail in the art scenes on the walls. You’re more likely, in this
picture, to focus on the content of the murals.
 The B&W image is less distracting and gives greater focus to the archi-
tecture — especially to the melding of the shade and light (from the
huge skylight) from the bottom to the top of the picture.
When shooting architecture, with its strong straight lines, watch out for
vignetting and line distortion — unless, of course, you want to exploit
those effects for an artsy twist to a shot. These effects are caused by the 

curvature and structure of your lens that can either be prevented or elimi-
nated (or welcomed):
 Vignetting: Some lenses create vignetting, whereby the sides of the shot are
darker than the interior, like a fading vignette-matte effect of an old-time
photo. Some, um, less-expensive lenses have this problem. You can switch
to a lens with better optics (say, from the lens that came with your SLR
or dSLR camera as part of a package to one of Canon’s L series lenses).
Vignetting is an easy fix in Photoshop CS2. Shoot in Raw format (see
Chapter 18) and fix the vignetting with a slider bar when your Raw
image is opened. And to research lenses with vignetting problems,
search online for equipment reviews and specs.
 Line distortion: Line distortion is the subtle curvature of a line that should
be straight. You can get shift lenses for your SLR or dSLR cameras (about
$1,300) that straighten out lines caused by lens curvature. Photoshop CS2
also has a cure for this ill — the Lens Distortion filter, which repairs quite
a few kinds of distortions.
When shooting a building, first study it in a variety of ways. Shoot so that
everything in the photo moves to one vanishing point or to one direction as
the viewer looks across the frame.
Shooting architecture as architecture is often best done at dusk and dawn
when the light is softer and the shadows are less harsh. (For dramatic art
photos, on the other hand, you might want to shoot architectural details with
harsh shadows.) The time of day in which you shoot architecture changes,
which in turn affects the look of your B&W photograph. A picture taken in the
noon sun can provide more detail. In contrast, a picture taken at dusk can
have more shadow — providing more contrast perhaps but also a little less
detail in any small objects in the shot. Finding the perfect time of day for
shooting in B&W is an experiment in light and shadow. You’ll know when you
get it right, and the results might surprise you.
Photographing at dusk when the sun is still above the horizon can be a dis-
aster, especially when long shadows from nearby trees are cast over your
architectural subjects. Figure 9-6 shows how late afternoon shadows can 
distract from the subject in a B&W architectural photograph.
Although the weather and the time of day (not to mention the time of year)
can affect how your picture comes out, adding to and/or taking away from
the focus of your structural subject, your perspective also involves some 
calculation.
179
Chapter 9: Crafting a Quality Black-and-White Art Photo

180
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Figure 9-6: Shooting late in the day can create undesirable shadows.
Figure 9-7 shows a picture that is divided about a third of the way so that every-
thing moves to two vanishing points — one to the left, and one to the right.
From these two points, you can tilt your camera in any direction so that the
vanishing points move up or down into the corner and/or top of the frame.
For more on composing a shot using the vanishing point, see Chapter 1.
Figure 9-7: Shoot from different perspectives.
You can tilt the canvas of your B&W and color images with minimal loss of
sharpness in your photo by choosing the Image➪Rotate Canvas option in
Photoshop. This is a great help when you are cropping your photos. See
Chapter 12.

The picture in Figure 9-8 was taken at
night. The shutter was set to stay
open for one-half second using the
Tv mode (shutter priority) of a digi-
tal camera. The aperture of the
camera was set automatically using
the light available to determine how
wide it would be for the half-second
it was open. The picture didn’t blur
because the camera was set on a
minitripod on top of a newspaper
stand. For more about night photo-
graphy, see Chapter 10.
Photoshop has a feature for turning
an image into a pen and ink style, like architecture drawings. You can read
about this technique in Chapter 15.
You’ve probably heard the old “stop and smell the roses” expression. I like to
apply this to architecture, especially the little stuff that comes attached to a
fence, gate, or door, or the bigger stuff that forms patterns like that found in iron
work. So when you’re looking for subjects to shoot in B&W, don’t forget archi-
tectural ornamentation — and get up close to capture all the detail.
Shooting portraits
Creating B&W photos gives you
experience in working with enhanced
shadows, highlights, shapes, and
forms without having to think about
color. Some subjects are a natural for
B&W photography, such as the por-
trait made of the stone figure shown
in Figure 9-9. You can see the weath-
ering in how B&W captures its tex-
ture: You can almost feel the statue’s
roughness. The camera’s depth of
field and the subtle blurring of the
background produces a totally pho-
tographic phenomenon that’s not
seen as clearly in any other art
medium or in person. It is this depth
and texture that brings emotion to
the viewer.

Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Take a look at the lighting in the following photos. The lighting affects how
the shadows, midtones, and highlights come out in your photograph, each
being different and dependent on how you expose the shot. (See Chapter 6
for more information about lighting with studio lights.)
 Flash, indoors: Flash inside creates bright light on a face. The light from
the flash and the ambient lighting mix leave a shadow in the background.
The fix for this might be not using the flash and upping the ISO speed to
ISO 400 (see Chapter 7). The left image in Figure 9-10 shows the powerful
effect that an in-camera flash has on lighting up the face of your subjects.
 Flash fill, outdoors: Using flash fill outdoors when your object is stand-
ing with his or her back to the sun is a good technique to keep the face
more evenly lit, augmenting enough light to prevent muddy tones. See
what I mean in Figure 9-10 (right image).
 No flash, indoors: Try to get away with using no flash inside for a more
natural picture. Move your subject near an outside window or some
decent light to take the shot. You can also place your subject so the light
reaches his or her face from different directions so that you emulate the
studio lighting described in Chapter 6.

Figure 9-10: Use flash for front lighting and flash fill for outdoors.

Many times photographers stay
away from severe shadow — 
shadows so dark that they surround
the subject by black. However, these
kinds of shadows can enhance the
physical features of a subject.
Portraiture doesn’t have to be formal
and composed. You can look for
opportunities for more candid shots,
too, like the woman with child in
Figure 9-11. Get a model release
from your human subjects! See the
following section for more on that.
Shooting for journalism
Photojournalism is a classic innova-
tion of photography as functional
art. If you’ve ever seen the news on
TV or online or read a newspaper or
magazine, you’ve been touched by
photojournalism. Who can forget the
gritty B&W newspaper photos of the
Vietnam War? Who doesn’t remem-
ber that even-earlier poignant kiss of
a sailor returning home and happy to
be there? Good photojournalism can
transport you to a time and place
instantly with its historic spontane-
ity and realism.

your subjects are relaxed.
Famous photojournalist: A look at press 
photographer Charlie McCarty
Thousands of photojournalists with AP and
dozens of news organizations throughout the
world have risked their lives covering war,
famine, the World Cup, and the NFL, capturing
not only pain but glory and achievement. These
people are the achievers themselves, speaking
about the world through their photographs and
news stories. Take Charlie McCarty, who with
his camera and flash strung around his neck,
documented the world in storytelling pho-
tographs until he was 80 years old. (He died in
2004.) And yes, he won a prize — in 1958, from
the National Press Photographers Association,
for a photograph of an incident among teens
during the civil rights struggle in the South. A
man and his camera: one picture worth an era
in words that communicated the uneasiness of
the times.

184
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Being a successful photojournalist is a matter of balancing preparedness,
timing, and luck. You’ve got to be at the right place at the right time with
your camera. Take a picture of an event that soon will be history, and you’ve
got yourself an image of merit — a document that over time becomes more
interesting.
To develop your own photojournalistic style, first try to emulate the best
photographers — and shots — in this field. You can search for the works
of Dorothea Lange, Margaret Bourke-White, and even Matthew Brady. Also
peruse the grand photo mags, like Look and LIFE. Train your eye to notice
what they did and develop your own style from there.
Here are places where you can find these snappable, historic events:
 In your own backyard: You can be anywhere when an event happens,
even your own home, say, when a lightening bolt strikes the tree in your
front yard and the tree goes up in flames. If your target is to sell to local
publications, these are the kinds of shots you want to be prepared for.
 When traveling: Suppose you witness a protest march. What a great
opportunity to snap pictures of the marchers or something artful that
accompanies them or is installed by them. Figure 9-12 captures a peace
march anchored by the classic Robert Indiana sculpture in the fore-
ground. (Of course, remember to find out what the protest was about
so you can make note of it.) Save the picture, bring it home, write an
article about what you saw, and submit (and submit, and submit again).
If it’s an interesting enough shot and your writing is good, chances are
that an Internet site, newspaper, or magazine will buy it from you.
Figure 9-12: A 1960s art piece anchors a 1960s-style protest.

Here are some thoughts to keep in mind if you’re considering trying to sell
photojournalism shots:
 B&W or color? Although many publications prefer B&W images, shoot
color. It’s a simple matter to convert a color image to grayscale, but 
converting grayscale to color means hand-painting the image.
 Facts, facts, facts: Be sure to document the date, time, and location of
your photojournalism shots. If you sell shots to a publication, those 
editors need this information.
 Model releases: When you capture people who are recognizable in your
shots, you need to get their names and have them sign a model release
form, which gives you permission to market their likeness. That’s not to
say that you have to get release forms for every person in a large crowd —
just when it’s obvious that a person is a deliberate subject of your photo.
Images of public figures — like politicians and celebrities — usually
don’t fall under this rule. However, if in doubt, get permission. And you
can always consult a publications lawyer for more advice. You can get
printable release forms here:
www.dpcorner.com/all_about/releases.shtml
 Simultaneous submissions: Some publications only accept submissions
that you haven’t sent to other publications for consideration or that have
not been previously published. And some publications might want only
one submission at a time from any one person. So, before you send your
work to a publication, find out its policies on these issues and adhere
to them.
 Timeliness: Many times you’ll think that you’re the first person who’s
captured a certain photograph or reported a journalism-worthy event.
Do some research before submitting your pic and/or writing. Google has
a good News search: Type in a few keywords associated with the event
to see whether it’s been written about yet.
Capturing Black and White
You can use many methods to get any image — those that are a hundred
years old to those of today — using negatives and positives of all shapes and
sizes, prints, and digital (Raw, TIFF, and JPEG) files — all printed clearly and
at high resolution in B&W. Pretty amazing stuff when you think about it.
(Read more about digital file types in Chapter 2.)
185
Chapter 9: Crafting a Quality Black-and-White Art Photo

186
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Creating a B&W image
Creating a B&W print requires no magic wand: You can
 Shoot with B&W film on a nondigital camera. Black-and-white film is
probably still the best medium for the genre. The light coming onto the
film can create natural sepias with realistic-looking grains that develop
when the film is mixed with chemicals.
 Shoot with your digital camera set to B&W mode. For what it is, it’s
good but can get to look a little like plastic.
 Take a color image and tweak it in Photoshop to make it appear B&W.
You can either desaturate your photos or scan them in grayscale mode.
Remember, too, that a digital camera actually captures a color image when
set to B&W. If you shoot in the Raw file format, you can easily restore the
color later in Photoshop’s Camera Raw plug-in.
B&W film
Not to insult your intelligence, but shooting in B&W on a nondigital camera
requires using B&W film. This gives you a negative or a positive (film type
depending) to enlarge to make a print. Just like color film, B&W film has an
ISO rating (how sensitive it is to light; see Chapter 6 for more on ISO ratings).
Scan a B&W print or developed film to create a digitized image that you can
tweak in an image editing program and then make copies. (See Chapter 3 for
more on scanners and slide attachments.) In the upcoming section, “Getting
the best quality image,” you can read more about using B&W slide film for
great results.
Shooting B&W on a digital camera
Obviously, digital cameras can’t use B&W film, but they do have a setting with
which you can shoot in B&W. The B&W mode in many cameras is among many
menu items (described in Chapter 12). In some cameras, it may be hard to find
without that handy roadmap, the User Guide. For example, the B&W feature
on a Canon Digital Rebel XT, can be found within a setting called Parameters.
So what’s better for B&W: film or digital? As a comparison, here are two
images, shot at the same time and angle: one on film and one that’s digital.
(Okay, both are technically digital now because the film image was scanned.)
But there are differences, as you can see in Figure 9-13. On the left is a B&W
film image of a Spanish-style staircase taken in the P (that’s point-and-shoot
mode) of a film (Canon Rebel) camera and then scanned with an HP Scanner.
On the right is the same image taken with a digital camera (a Canon Digital
Rebel), again in the P mode. The film image has a somewhat broader tonal
range, with darker shadows and brighter highlights, while the digital image
shows better detail in the shadows.

Figure 9-13: B&W film versus digital comparison.
There are at least a dozen parameters at work when you look at images printed on
a computer or in this book that can make the two different — and those param-
eters aren’t always because of the digital versus film format itself. And of
course, there’s always the factor of personal preference. So rather than declar-
ing one medium superior to the other for B&W photography, let me caution you
to remember that the quality of your digital art photos, whether originating
as pixels or on film, depends on two things: the settings you use when capturing
the image and the post-capture processing you do in your image editing software.
Don’t forget that when you capture in the Raw file format, all the image’s orig-
inal data is still part of the file, including color. Using Photoshop’s Camera Raw
plug-in (or other Raw-capable software), you can always return to the original
image, as captured in the camera, complete with full color (even when the
camera was set to use its B&W feature).
Manipulating a color image to become B&W
You can manipulate digital B&W digital images so that they look like B&W
film prints. Sometimes you might need a B&W shot for certain types of publi-
cations, like catalogs or newspapers. Or, you might want to convert a color
image to B&W (see the earlier section, “Creating a B&W image”) to invoke a
sense of nostalgia and time past.

Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Face it, the past sells. And B&W 
is an important piece of the past.
From deco to retro, people like to
have a piece of the past. Imagine
an image of a woman wearing an
apron in a 1950s-style kitchen or a
man outside in a bathrobe picking
up the newspaper, waving happily at
the neighbor in front of a 1920s
Craftsman home. The old days
become new again for younger folks,
and the old days are relived by older
folks. Figure 9-14 shows a B&W shot
of a modern building — a photo-
graph that was shot this century but
looks like it was shot decades ago
because of the architecture and its
lack of color.
For the deepest grayscale tones,
choose the Channel Mixer option in
Photoshop. Knowing how to do this is a must for anyone who loves B&W
photography. Here’s how you do it:
1. Open your image in Photoshop and examine each color channel 
individually.
Open the Channels palette and click on each channel, one at a time,
to evaluate what it offers to the final grayscale image. Which channel
has the best detail in the highlights? Which channel has the best detail
in the shadows?
2. Choose Layer➪New Adjustment Layer➪
Channel Mixer, click OK, and then select
the Monochrome check box.
After you click OK in the New Layer dialog
box, click the Monochrome check box (in
the lower-left corner of the Channel Mixer
dialog box; see Figure 9-15) to give your
image a grayscale appearance.
3. Move the slider bars to tweak the black
and white in your image.
Using the information you gleaned from the
Channels palette in Step 1, balance the sliders
Figure 9-14: Make modern photographs appear
vintage.
Figure 9-15: Make a grayscale
image here.

to produce the best possible tonal range for your image. Increase the
values of the channels that have good detail in the highlights and shadows,
and compensate for their added contributions to the image by reducing
the value of the third channel. Finding the perfect mix of channels is a
balancing act — and of course, there can be different combinations that
provide equally pleasing results.
Generally you start with a properly exposed color image; the values of
the four Channel Mixer sliders should (ideally) total about 100. (Multiply
the value of the Constant slider by three before doing your math — that
slider is applied to all three color values.)
Figure 9-16 shows the original image of corn (color) and the change to B&W.
Figure 9-16: The same source image, shot in color and converted to B&W.
4. (Optional) Flatten your image by choosing Layer➪Flatten Image.
Remember that the value of using an adjustment layer in Photoshop is
flexibility. Unlike using an adjustment command, an adjustment layer
lets you change your mind. If you don’t flatten the image and you save it
in Photoshop’s PSD file format (or another format that supports layers),
you can reopen the image and change your adjustment. If, for example, you
find that your printed image is too dark in the shadows, you can simply
reopen the image, reopen the adjustment layer (by double-clicking it in
Photoshop’s Layers palette), and change the sliders. If, however, you’re
quite happy with the image as is, feel free to flatten the image.
Getting the best quality image
Whatever your reason for capturing and printing in B&W, you want to start with
the best image possible. You won’t get a quality print from a so-so image. You
can’t serve hamburger and pass it off as filet mignon, you know. Here’s how.

Part II: The Photo Shoot 
To create a great print, you need to start with a great image — a quality image,
that is. You want the best quality image that your camera can capture whether
you shoot with B&W film (and scan those images) or with a digital camera set
to B&W. For the highest-quality photographs, follow these pointers:
 Film: Shoot with B&W slide film and scan the positives.
Scanning from a positive (a slide), rather than from a negative, gives
you better results because your scan doesn’t need to be inverted 
(swapping black and white). Although this isn’t nearly the problem
for B&W film that it is for color, you’re still likely to be happier with
scans of B&W slides than with scans of B&W negative film.
You can read about scanning images in Chapter 3.
 Digital: Shoot in B&W mode.
• dSLR: Shoot in Raw format, the highest resolution format with set
standards that relates directly to the sensor on the camera. See
Chapter 3 for more about Raw format, dSLRs, and how to set your
camera to shoot Raw.
• Non-dSLR: Shoot in highest photo quality mode that your camera
dictates for non-dSLR. Most digital cameras capture images using
a high-resolution JPEG format that’s convertible to a high-quality
TIFF format — one that can print images at 8" x 10" inches without
pixilation.
After you make changes to a JPEG image in an image editing program,
I recommend that you save in another format. Resaving as JPEG can
degrade the image quality through recompression. (It’s safe to open
and close a JPEG as many times as you want — it’s only the process
of compressing during saving that causes problems.) TIFF is a non-
lossy file format that is an excellent choice for digital photos.
a. Choose File➪Save As (or click the Save icon in the program).
b. In the Save As dialog box that opens, click the list for choices of file
type (usually JPEG).
A drop-down menu appears.
c. Choose TIFF from the drop-down menu.
d. Navigate to the location in your computer or to the location in your
external hard drive where you want the file saved and then save it.
Understanding the 256 shades of gray
A B&W photograph comprises shades of gray that add definition and depth
and detail to the image. Figure 9-17 shows a chart depicting shades of gray in
5-percent increments from darkest to lightest (including the background color,
which is the 50% gray sample). The chart includes a total of 21 shades of gray.
The image of a hibiscus flower (in Figure 9-18) shows the range of gray that makes
up a typical B&W photo. There are 256 distinct shades of gray in the photo.

Figure 9-17: Shades of gray, from black to white.
Digital cameras set to 8-bit color offer 256 shades of gray from pure white
to pure black. If you’re shooting in Raw, your camera can capture in 16-bit
color — twice as much digital data is used to record the image, producing a
much greater number of subtly different shades of gray. Depending on how
much processing and editing you do, and depending on your printing device,
you might see no difference between 8-bit and 16-bit grayscale prints.

Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Landscape shots can provide a natural scene containing clear highlights that
contrast with the midtones and shadows in the image. (A good B&W photo-
graph has many contrasts between light and dark tones.) The photograph in
Figure 9-19 shows dimension using B&W:
Figure 9-19: Landscapes offer interesting composition tones.
 Foreground: White salt. Also
note the salt bags, the face of
each covered in a shadow. See
the following section for more
on shadows.
 Contrast: Two objects in the
middle ground — one dark and
one light, which provide good
contrast — that is, broad differ-
ences between the darkest and
lightest parts of the photo.
 Background: Light clouds
above shadowed mountains in
the background, providing more
good contrast in gray tones.
To enhance tonal difference in your
B&W shots, assess the tones of your
subject and then choose a back-
ground that is different. If you’re
shooting something with a lot of
highlights, choose a very dark back-
ground, as many product photogra-
phers do. See how effective this can
be in Figure 9-20.
Figure 9-20: Flowers, in B&W, contrast with an
almost-black background.

When shooting outdoors with B&W, look for great tones that nature throws your
way, especially when it comes to moisture-bearing entities, like clouds, fog, haze,
and steam. What’s murky when shot in color can often be brought out as a very
interesting highlight. Clouds can be your friend, either filtering harsh sunlight or
cutting across the sun, giving you dramatic shadows. Fog and haze can provide
wondrous midtones or spectacular highlights when side- or backlit. (For more
on light sources, see Chapter 5.) And don’t forget to look for steam — from a
train, a geyser, a heating system, a tea kettle, or hot lava hitting the ocean.
Your lighting source and direction help define how many highlights and shad-
ows your shot will have.
Defining highlights, midtones, and shadows
In B&W photography, distinctions are also made in the gray tones of various
colors by how dark or light they are. These distinctions become even more
important in B&W because these tones are in essence the “color” of the
photo. By knowing what highlights, midtones, and shadows mean, you can
 Tell whether you have a decent print, exposure, or onscreen image.
When I pull a B&W image onscreen, I look for clarity in the distinction of
grays. Take, for instance, the picture of the Spanish architecture on the
left in Figure 9-21. Check the contrast in two spots within the frame. You
can see, for example, that the tiles on the roof are distinguishable from
one another because each has a different shade of gray, and the place
where the mountain meets the sky also differ by a couple of shades of
gray, indicating good contrast.
Figure 9-21: Good contrast means having a balance between many tones.
During the evaluation of your photos and/or when you are tweaking them
in Photoshop, pick out a few spots and evaluate the contrast in each. In
many photos, one area can have really good contrast, while another area
does not. Not a good thing in architectural or landscape photography.

194
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
 Understand how to manipulate an image in an image processing pro-
gram. If, indeed, one part of an image has better contrast than another,
you can tweak the image using a number of options:
In Raw format, use the Temperature, Tint, Exposure, Shadows,
Brightness, and Contrast sliders in Photoshop’s Camera Raw
dialog box.
If you shoot JPEG or TIFF, adjust your image by using Image➪
Adjustments➪Shadows/Highlights or Image➪Adjustments➪
Exposure.
 Add depth (the capturing of shading and light to give the illusion of
dimension) to your image when shooting and when editing it.
• To add depth when shooting: Look for spots with a foreground,
middle ground, and background. Experiment with your f-stop
(see Chapter 11) so that you can blur your backgrounds to make
your subject stand out so you can see its sides in perspective.
• To add depth when editing: Tweak the exposure, brightness, and/or
contrast sliders when the image is in Raw format so that the con-
trast is natural looking with no large areas of white and/or black.
See a before/after example in Figure 9-22. Doing this also corrects
what you’ve done to your image previously. Hint: This feature
works especially well when there’s no color in your image.
Figure 9-22: Tweaking the contrast adds depth to your image.

So what do these terms mean?
 Highlights: Just think of
going to a hair salon to have
highlights — lighter shades —
added to your hair. Figure 9-23
shows how dramatic high-
lights can be during late day
in summer. Shoot to where
the sun was after dusk to get
beautiful silhouettes with high-
lighted backgrounds on partially
cloudy days.
 Midtones: These are the tones
that make up the middle shades
of gray. When shooting barren
landscapes devoid of sky, you
can get a photo composed
mostly of midtones, as in
Figure 9-24.
 Shadows: Unlike the silhouette
you cast on the sidewalk on
a sunny day, the shadows in
your digital image can include
objects themselves. If your 
subject is between you and
the light, the term shadow in
photography refers not only
to the shadow on the ground
cast by your subject but also
to the dark tones of the subject
itself.

Hi, ho, silver!
Museum and gallery curators refer to B&W pho-
tographic prints as silver-gelatin prints. Silver —
an ingredient that ends up in the final print — is
one of the materials in the process that makes
a photograph come to life. A standard B&W 
photograph is produced in a darkroom, on pho-
tographic paper that’s coated with gelatin and
compounds containing silver — hence, the name.
The cost of a silver-gelatin print isn’t prohibitive
despite its chemical composition.

196
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Look — really look — at your surroundings in terms of identifying dark areas,
light areas, and in between areas of B&W tone. Train your eye to read light
and not just color.
Just like you can divide any photograph into thirds, horizontally or vertically,
also pay attention to the tones of your photograph, from light to middle to
dark. You can use a histogram to analyze and tweak your image’s exposure:
1. Choose Layer➪New Adjustment Layer➪Levels to create a layer in
Photoshop to which these changes will apply.
2. Click OK in the next dialog box.
Your new layer is called Levels 1,
as shown in the Layers palette.
(Choose Window➪Layers to
see the Layers palette.) Also,
a window like that shown in
Figure 9-25 appears. This is
your Levels adjustment dialog
box, which includes the his-
togram (a map of the tones
of your image).
3. Click and drag the white and
dark slider bars on each end
so that they match up with
the beginning and end of the
curves. Then slide the middle
point toward the area where
the curves reach up the most
vertically and click OK.
As you make changes, keep an
eye on your image to be sure
you don’t overdo it.
Figure 9-25: The “mountain range” shows the
distribution of tonal values in your image.
The B&W world of Winogrand
Study the B&W photography of Garry Winogrand
(www.getty.edu/art/collections/bio/
a1834-1.html), who photographed the streets
of America throughout his lifetime during the
last century. In 1959, his photographs of street
scenes and landscapes in Los Angeles and
New York City captured everything from con-
vertibles among skyscrapers enshrouded in haze
to the long shadows of girls in miniskirts among
offbeat surroundings depicting the good life, the
desperate life, and an often bigger-than-life life.

Printing for best quality
After you compose your image and have a digital image to work with, it’s time
to make a print. Yeah!
You’ve walked the walk. Now it’s time to talk the talk — the photography talk,
that is. You got hold of a good printer, say an Epson Stylus Photo 2200, and
now you’re ready to take your show on the road.
The print of choice for museum quality is a silver-gelatin print. Digitally
speaking, though, your silver-gelatin print is going to look better on some
papers than others. I use enhanced matte because it’s inexpensive, takes to
the ink very well, and looks great behind glass. New papers come out all the
time from rag to fine art to canvas. Try www.inkjetart.com to get all the
latest about new papers and their compatibility with your printer and any
special settings you might have to use. For more about printing the final
product, see Chapter 17. To read about print mountings and framing, hop to
Chapter 18.
You can name your B&W prints by the type of paper you use and/or the type
of print process you’ve used to make them.

Chapter 9: Crafting a Quality Black-and-White Art Photo
Julius Shulman: Creator of an eternal future
Architectural photographer Julius Shulman
selected the best middle-of-the-last century
buildings and homes — architecture by well-
known architects, such as Richard Neutra and
Frank Lloyd Wright — to capture on film. He has
become well known for studying the components
of the architecture he has shot. His iconographic
photography not only teaches us about mod-
ernism though a wide angle lens but also about
the futuristic optimism of the era’s architecture.
His photographs, set in reality of steel and glass,
were so fine tuned that even today, they set the
standard for the future.
Shulman photographed architecture by talented
architects. (He met Richard Neutra in 1936 by
showing him photographs that he had taken of
Neutra’s designs.) He studied the materials
that he photographed: how the mid-century
wall-to-ceiling glass reflected desert light, and
when and where shadows from posts and beams
made or broke a photograph.
By understanding the architecture in your com-
munity in the same way that Shulman did (by
identifying buildings and homes you like and that
are significant styles coveted by professionals —
an arts-and-crafts home or an Edwardian), you
can look at these and other similar structures
that interest you. Scout them out and watch the
light that shines upon them. Sometimes you’ll
find that dark shadows are beautiful at noon,
repeating and perhaps falling in patterns oppos-
ing and/or juxtaposing the structure that cast
them. Choose an architectural hot spot of
beauty and look at it at different times of the day;
then pick up your camera when the light is right
and photograph it in B&W.

David Glomb, architectural photographer
With a rebirth of interest in modern architecture,
a home-building boom, and new renovations of
inner city neighborhoods, the media buzz has put
architecture in the bull’s eye of public interest.
With home improvement first on everybody’s list
these days, taking pictures of a well-done home
in the latest modern style has become big busi-
ness, too. Magazines such as Dwell and
Architectural Digest contain the works of the
best-known architectural photographers.
One of these architectural photographers,
David Glomb (photographer for the book Palm
Springs Modern) makes his job evaluating light
and shadow. “Shadows and light work for you
or against you,” Glomb says. “It’s all in artistic
interpretation. Every situation has its own unique
characteristic.”
Glomb shoots digitally when evaluating a location.
He still prefers to use film, but uses his Canon a
lot for producing his images for Web sites like
Architecture Week (www.architecture
week.com). His favorite camera is a Mamiya
RZ 67, an electronically controlled 6 x 7cm film
format camera that’s an industry standard.

Images of the night have mystified and intrigued artists throughout time,
especially with the advent of photography. After all, you have to have light to
create a photograph, and nighttime is well, dark. However, with the
tricks and techniques I show you in this chapter, you can tame
the night and capture the denizens of the dark — at least in
a photo. Not only can you capture what the night truly
holds, but you can also use low-light situations to your
creative advantage to craft shots that are fantasy-like,
just like the magic of the night itself.
Taking a Shot in the Dark
Understandably, shooting at night has inherent 
problems — namely, the lack of available light. Without
adequate light, color tones shift, becoming overly muted
and neutral, as shown in Figure 10-1. To compensate for the
low light, you can tweak the following settings by themselves
or in combination, but each can introduce more problems:
 Use a wider aperture. This reduces your depth of field but allows more
light to reach your camera’s sensor.
 Use a slower shutter speed. Subjects are more easily blurred (unless
you use a tripod or otherwise support the camera), but, again, more
light reaches the sensor. 

200
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
 Use flash. This can create uneven illumination and washed-out areas in
your shot, but it provides the light necessary to capture the image.
 Use a higher ISO/ASA. This results in more noise/grain. Most of the time,
you’ll want to resist the urge to use an ISO setting higher than 400, even
at night.

Figure 10-1: Night photos are often filled with muted tones.
The art photographer that you are, however, will not be thwarted by such
limitations. Right? Take all these tethers and turn them into creative advan-
tages. The night is full of too many wonderful events and views to avoid
simply because not much light is available.
Here’s how to take a con of nighttime shooting and turn it into a pro, just like
you (pun intended):
 Use a slightly longer exposure time to show action. A long exposure
(longer shutter speed) captures “marching ants,” neon lights, or a kid
with a sparkler or fireworks drawing crazy scribbles of color in the
night, as shown in Figure 10-2.

Figure 10-2: To shoot fireworks, use a tripod to get an unblurred shot.
When your camera must remain steady during a long exposure time, a
tripod or other support is necessary. And tripods don’t have to be giant,
cumbersome beasts, either. Look for small, inexpensive collapsible ones
that are very portable. Bonus: Small tripods are great for placing your
camera near ground level so that you can shoot upward and with a long
exposure, like the image shown in Figure 10-3. This shot, which I took in
Manual mode, wouldn’t be possible handheld because you’d get blur

from camera shake. Read more about tripods in the later section, “Seek
nighttime landscapes,” and about Manual mode in “Creating a blur-free,
flashless night photo.”
Figure 10-3: Because this was taken with a tripod, this shot is blur-free.
Tripods aren’t always necessary in night shooting, however. In the next
section, “Creating a blur-free, flashless night photo,” I discuss ways to
shoot at night without a tripod.

 Use a much longer exposure time to show motion. A long exposure
turns car lights or lighted amusement park rides into ribbons of color, as
shown in Figure 10-4.

Figure 10-4: Amusement park rides make great night photos.
 Use a series of shorter exposures over time to show progression. A
series of shots like this can show the moon dancing across the night sky,
as shown in Figure 10-5. See the sidebar, “Putting the moon to bed,” later
in this chapter, for more about this technique.
Figure 10-5: Follow the moon to bed.

Part II: The Photo Shoot 
 Take advantage of soft, ambient lighting: Look around for natural night
lighting — streetlights, the moon and stars, or a lamp’s soft glow, as in
Figure 10-6.
Figure 10-6: Look for ambient night lighting.
When you can find the perfect ambient night lighting, your camera’s
flash will ruin the effect. Don’t use flash unless absolutely necessary.
You might have to override your camera’s default setting to disable the
flash when shooting in the dark.
Creating a blur-free, flashless night photo
Once upon a time, taking pictures at night meant that you absolutely had to
have a flash; if you didn’t use a flash, you definitely needed a tripod. Back then
(oh, sometime in the last millennium), the standard film speed was ISO 100.
Fast black-and-white (B&W) film (400 ASA) appeared on the scene in the 1950s,
and 400-speed film hit the market in the mid-1970s. Those faster films certainly
helped with low-light and night photography exposure needs, as did even
faster films that followed.
To photograph at night with a film camera and then scan the negatives, 
positives, or prints later, you should use film with an ISO rating of 400 or
higher. If you set your camera to a low film speed (say ISO 100) or load it

with 100 B&W/color film, you will get
handheld blur when shooting at
night, no matter how steady you are.
The higher the ISO speed, the noisier
(digital) or grainier (film) an image
will be. Using ISO 400 film gives you
far less grain and more clarity with
night pictures than ISO 800 film.
When shooting digitally, the differ-
ence in noise between an ISO setting
of 400 and ISO 800 is even greater for
most cameras.
Figure 10-7 shows a pair of neon
signs. The top image was taken with
ISO 200 film. Because of the longer
shutter speed required by the slow
film, the image is somewhat blurry —
an error that would put off many
potential buyers. In comparison,
the neon sign on the bottom was
shot with a faster film — ISO 400 —
resulting in a clearer shot.
Blur in nighttime photos has to have
a specific focus, such as to show
motion. If not, blur looks like (is) a
technical error. When shooting neon
signs as historical photos (and these
images are marketable, by the way),
you should have no blur because it
would have no purpose. Blur serves
a purpose only when it’s indicating
movement or time or when giving
photos a mysterious quality.
If flashless night photos are your
goal, you can achieve them without
blur. The first thing to do in order to
take a good night photo without a
flash (and maybe without a tripod) is
to scout out areas with enough light.
After you find a good location with
abundant streetlights and well-lit
buildings, you’re ready to practice.
For example, shooting architecture
and cityscapes at night gives you
some pretty remarkable shots using
only the light that’s available.

Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Because buildings, gates, and bridges are usually well lit (and dramatically lit,
too), they offer some great opportunities to shoot without a flash, as you can
see from Figure 10-8.
Figure 10-8: Get handheld shots with no blur when ISO is set to 1600.
1. Set your camera for the available light.
• ISO
Load a film camera with ISO 400 film; set your digital camera to
ISO 400.
• Exposure control
a. Set your SLR or dSLR camera to Av mode, the manual mode in which
you can set your f-stop and your flash won’t go off automatically.
If you’re using a point-and-shoot digital camera, turn off the flash
first.
b. Choose an f-stop of 8.

2. Look for an object that has sufficient light around it.
Figure 10-9 shows St. Petersburg, Russia, at night, which is lit by ample
amounts of ambient nighttime light. This image is scanned from an
ISO 400 film negative.
3. Press your camera’s shutter release halfway to let your camera per-
form its autofocus chore.
Figure 10-9: Use available nighttime light.
As dusk approaches nightfall and you find yourself losing light quickly, you’ll
have to reset your camera at some point because the auto modes don’t do all
that well with variable light, like the light you get at night. You also need to
watch out for surrounding light sources — flood lights, street lights, and car
lights.
207
Chapter 10: Night Art Photography

208
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Here are the basic exposure controls on your camera that can help you suc-
cessfully shoot at night:
 Shutter priority (Tv on most cameras): This is an exposure mode that lets
you control the time that the
shutter of your camera remains
open, while your camera auto-
matically sets how wide the
aperture opens to let just enough
light in to give you a good pic-
ture. You can experiment at
many different shutter speeds
to get a different effect. If you
want to turn car lights into rib-
bons of color, as in Figure 10-10,
you would set shutter priority
to a longer exposure time.
Don’t be confused by what your
camera’s LCD screen or viewer is reading in terms of shutter speeds. 1⁄250
is displayed as 250 on most cameras, whereas 1⁄60, a smaller number but
longer exposure, is displayed as 60.
 Aperture priority (Av on most cameras): This exposure mode lets you
control the size of the aperture in your lens, while your camera automat-
ically sets how long the shutter remains open to give your picture ade-
quate light (exposure). When photographing at night, you don’t want
your lens open too wide because you’ll get white out (when too much
light hits your sensor or film causing a blazing white shadow to sweep
across your frame), especially if your shutter is open a long time. This
mode’s great for close-ups of neon signs, but Tv is a better mode for
everything else that dances in the night with less light.
Your camera’s indicator light can help you get your light right. Don’t
shoot if it’s red or blinking red. Wait for the green light as you look
through the viewfinder and press your shutter halfway down. Then,
press the shutter button all the way down to take your picture.
 Manual mode (M on most cameras): This mode lets you control both
the aperture and the shutter speed, giving you nearly complete control
over your exposure. After setting up the camera and switching to
Manual mode, press the shutter button halfway down to autofocus and
let the camera evaluate the existing light. In the viewfinder, you’ll see
(on most digital cameras that offer a true Manual mode) the small expo-
sure scale, indicating whether your selected f-stop and shutter speed
will produce an underexposed, normally exposed, or overexposed image.
Remember that under and over are relative terms when shooting at
night. Some midrange digital cameras offer a Manual mode that doesn’t
let you set specific values for the aperture (f-stop) and shutter speed,
but rather presents you with the exposure scale and lets you choose to
underexpose or overexpose the shot.
Figure 10-10: Choose shutter priority and use a
longer exposure to capture traffic at night.

 Metering: This is when your camera measures how much light is avail-
able in a portion of the frame of your picture. On some cameras, you’ll
get a green light indicating your shot is a go when you’ve got your set-
tings set and have your finger pushing halfway down on the shutter
release. The light meter of your camera works the same, whether it’s
day or night. But if you’re using long shutter speeds and not using
the shutter priority mode (which is all you can do on some point-and-
shoots), your exposures will vary widely from too dark to too light to
just right. But, hey, you’ve got a digital camera and you can keep trying
until you get it right. Your camera should have a choice of metering
zones.
When you set both your camera’s aperture and shutter speed manually,
bracket your shots — that is, take shots at progressive shutter speeds —
until you get the exposure you want. Your camera might offer exposure
bracketing as a setting. You can, for example, set the bracketing to take three
shots at predetermined exposure intervals; then press the shutter release
three times.

Chapter 10: Night Art Photography
Night dreaming
Folks like art that takes them to a different place
and time. Night photos can change a viewer’s
mood, perhaps even transport the viewer to an
anywhere-but-here mentality. Okay, so it’s not
nighttime in Paris everywhere in the world, but
when people look at a picture of nighttime in
Paris, their thoughts can drift to being somewhere
else, perhaps sipping coffee in a café in Paris at
night. If Paris isn’t someone’s idea of a nice place
to be, try Rome, New York City, or a late-night
stroll in a plaza in Venice, as shown here.

Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Using fast film and 
high ISO settings
To be able to exploit wider aperture
settings when shooting at night, pull
out the fast film or set your digital
camera to a fast ISO speed. Fast film
and/or high ISO settings on your digi-
tal camera let you take night pictures
without using your flash, which
means you get more of the natural
light from the surroundings in your
picture.
If you have a dSLR, select the Av
mode and choose an f-stop of f/6.7
or f/8. (For more about Av, see
Chapter 9.) If you’re using a digital
point-and-shoot, set your camera
to night mode or auto mode and set
the ISO speed to 800. If you’re using
film, load it with ISO 400 or 800 film.
In Figure 10-11, you can see the dif-
ference between shooting at ISO 80
and ISO 3200 on a dSLR.
For a cool, grainy, mysterious effect, choose a setting above ISO 800 on your dig-
ital camera. Anything grainy, smoky, and/or empty (like empty chairs or shots
with no subjects or one subject alone) will create a feeling of isolation, long
considered a mainstay of humanity in many works in the art world. (For more

ority mode, with an f-stop of 8 and an ISO speed
of 400. The general auto setting will set your f-
stop in this range, too, but you need to turn the
autoflash off. These are good settings, but look
around and if there’s other light around you’ll
have to adjust a bit lower, say to f/5.6. Or you
can up your ISO setting to 800 or higher (which
risks adding too much digital noise).

Bottom: Detail is lost at high ISO.

about ideas for interesting photos,
see Chapter 4.) As of this writing,
Canon has a dSLR that you can crank
the ISO up to 3200 (wow). See in
Figure 10-12 how using a high ISO
(1600 for this shot) introduces some
artsy noise, which makes the picture
more grainy and adds to the isolated
effect.
Photoshop offers a variety of filters
that you can use to reduce unwanted
noise or grain in your image — and
others that you can use to add noise
or grain. Photoshop CS2 includes the
powerful Reduce Noise filter, which
works wonders on both luminance
noise (light colored specks in your
shadows and areas of solid color) and
digital noise (specks of red, green,
and blue scattered throughout the
image). Of course, if you don’t like
digital noise in your images, it’s gen-
erally easier and more effective to
simply use a tripod and a lower ISO
(perhaps 200) when shooting at night.
Shooting with a flash
So when’s the right time to use your
flash at night for art photos? My
advice: Take advantage of your flash
only when you are capturing objects
close-up.
Figure 10-13 shows that a flash was
used to take pictures (really portraits)
of Tikis in Honolulu. There was little
light around for this shot so the flash
provided almost all the Tikis’ illumi-
nation. Sure, it’s harsh light — bright
and concentrated — but it can be a
helpful art photo creation tool, creat-
ing a pretty cool effect, especially on
the Tikis, which are made to look a
little sinister in this instance.

Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Here’s another great way to be cre-
ative when shooting at night with a
flash. You know those wretched red
and green demon eyes you get when
shooting people and animals with a
flash? Take advantage of those night
eyes and be aware of opportunities
to capture animals of the night, like
owls, frogs, or a cat on the prowl, as
shown in Figure 10-14. (If your back-
yard is a bit short of wildlife, check
out your local zoo.)
Your camera’s flash is a blessing
when you’re shooting in almost total
darkness. Don’t be afraid to use it if you need to, but keep in mind its limita-
tions. (It reaches out only about 10 feet in front of you.)
Other Nighttime Art Opportunities
After you get a little practice (and confidence) shooting at night, here are
some other great ways to think about photography in the dark.
Light your subject 
from beneath
Anything lit from beneath shows
drama. If motion is involved, so much
the better because your longer shut-
ter speeds will exaggerate the motion
to create some nifty other-worldly
effects. Look for fountains as good
examples of this, as in Figure 10-15.
And don’t forget how well lighted
fountains photograph in B&W, too;
read about B&W photography in
Chapter 9.
Shoot the moon
Here’s a subject that’s available most nights: the moon. Sure, it might hide
beneath a cloud or change size, but photographing the moon — especially
when it plays with the tiny droplets of water vapor illuminated by the clouds, as
in Figure 10-16 — can provide you with some pretty stellar shots. (Get it, stel-
lar?) If you can capture the moon reflecting off water or turn it slightly blue in
Photoshop (more about that in Chapter 15) or by attaching a color filter to your
camera (more about that in Chapter 11), you’re on your way to a money shot.

Figure 10-15: Shoot fountains lit at night.

Figure 10-16: Capture the (blue) moon with your own style.
How much light does a full moon give? Not a lot. A handheld digital camera
exposure when shooting the moon will have blur unless
 The moon is on the horizon, big and full, and you’re zooming directly
into it so that it fills most of the frame.
 Other lights are around — bright ones — and a lot of them.
 You use a tripod.
 You use very fast film (above ISO 800) or set your digital camera to that
ISO equivalent or higher.
Figure 10-17 shows two shots of the moon — one at ISO 400, which is a
fairly fast film speed but still not fast enough to eliminate the blur from the
moon high in the sky with minimal ambient lighting from a few neon signs.
The second shot shows the moon captured with better sharpness (photo

Part II: The Photo Shoot

Figure 10-17: The moon clear and not-so-clear depends on how you shoot it.
Be quick when shooting the moon:
 When the moon is at that perfect place — the horizon — it doesn’t stick
around all that long.
 The amount of light from the moon decreases rapidly as it rises from the
horizon to the sky.
Putting the moon to bed
When the moon comes up and out, wolves howl
(that is, if you live in the outback). You’ll do some
howling, too, when you discover the photo ops
that this celestial body offers as seen through
your lens. A few tricks of the trade are in order
here, as the moon, whether it’s a sliver in the sky
or half or full, is a fascinating little rascal:
 Check out a Web site (www.shetline.
com/java/moonphase/moonphase.
html) that offers a moon phase calendar so
that you know when to shoot. There’s noth-
ing worse than wanting to shoot the moon
and finding out it’s not out there yet (what
astronomers call a new moon).
 Watch where the moon moves in the sky a
few days before you shoot. Look for where
it rises and sets and scout out a space
where you can catch all of that in glorious
detail. If the weather’s good a day or two
later, return to that same spot to shoot it.
 Use a tripod, press your shutter halfway down
to get it in focus, and then move your camera
(still holding down the shutter release
halfway) to where you want it. Shoot at a
lower f-stop and with your lens set at a focal
length of 90mm or greater. Use your camera’s
timer or a cable release for the clearest shot.
Tip: If you’re shooting the moon going to bed, be
quick, as it settles into the horizon in seconds.
If you want a series of shots of the moon slip-
ping down, shut off your timer and snap a pic-
ture every two or three seconds.

Seek nighttime landscapes
Landscapes at night offer a different
take on a standard shot, as shown
in Figure 10-18. For sharp nighttime
landscapes, experiment with the
higher aperture range that your digi-
tal camera offers: that is, f/16 or f/22.
Don’t forget to make the moon your
ally when shooting at night, too, both
for the light it provides as well as
being an important element when
composing your shot.
If you want a clear shot without
graininess in your image, bring along a
small tripod when you’re shooting at night. Think of this three-legged beast as
your assistant who holds your camera steady so you get no blur.
1. Set your camera on either a tripod or another surface that’s steady
(like a ledge or a rock).
Make sure your tripod is stable and relatively level. Double-check
through the viewfinder that your image is level and adjust the tripod
accordingly the best you can.
2. Take your shot via the camera’s timer or use a cable release so that
you don’t shake the camera when pushing the shutter-release button.
215
Chapter 10: Night Art Photography
Figure 10-18: The moon is your friend when it
comes to composing shots at night.
Making an instant tripod
Many times you won’t have a tripod with you at
night. In that case, you have to make do. And
there’s not always a flat appropriate-height sur-
face close by (like a ledge or a car). Here are
some tricks to help you to steady your camera
when you make your body the camera’s tripod:
 Hold only your camera (put all your bags,
and so on, down).
 Keep your arms (elbows) close to your body.
 Lean against something stable, like a wall
or a tree, if possible.
 Keep your legs some distance apart.
 Press the shutter release button slowly with
your index finger, moving it very slowly.
 Press the shutter release after a long
exhale — that’s when your body is most
still.
Remember: Even if you don’t have a tripod, you
can improvise with what’s around you. Look for
a stable and level place to set your camera
when taking a photo: newspaper stands, walls,
street fixtures, crates, or tables.

216
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Use reflections
Always look for water where there are lights.
Water, with its inherent reflectivity, gives you a
double chance to show off the beauty of the
night, as in Figure 10-19. This amusement park
ride delights twice over: once with its bright
neon lights and again with its water reflection.
Seek out shadows and weather
Shadows at night can be harsh and egregious,
making for a good opportunity to create a study
in lines and patterns. Look for lit wrought iron
gates and fences or heavily backlit scenes like in
the left image of Figure 10-20. Look for weather
nighttime opportunities, too. For example, get out
and shoot at night (with ambient light, like from a
streetlamp) when it’s snowing — you’ll get some
great blur, especially when using slower shutter
speeds. Lightning at night is very dramatic (see
the right image of Figure 10-20), but I’m not
encouraging you to put yourself in harm’s way.

I
n Hollywood, you think of special effects as Jurassic Park stuff or maybe
Harry Potter zooming about, playing a game of Quidditch. In magic, a spe-
cial effect is pulling a rabbit out of a hat. In math, a special effect is
that the digits of multiples of nine add up to nine. In traditional
photography, you might think of a special effect as water
flowing in a stream, looking as if it were billows of steam.
Special effects, really, are what you want them to be.
After all, they’re what’s inside your head — what 
ultimately comes out when you set and focus your
camera on something — anything, invented or 
otherwise.
My definition of special effects (as I use this term in
this chapter for the purposes of creating digital art
photography), however, encompasses using particu-
lar measures — tweaking camera modes, using time
lapse, employing video techniques, and so on — while
shooting photographs that achieve certain creative results.
Using these techniques are the sort of special effect this chapter
covers. If you want to add Jurassic Park dinosaurs to your photographs,
you have to use Photoshop.

Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Tweaking Automatic Modes and Settings 
to Achieve Creative Results
Capturing an image of a unique home at dusk, your best friend up close with
a blurred background, a gorgeous landscape, a flower, or a tennis player on
the court requires only a simple move of your camera’s modes. In this section,
I show you how to take the traditional uses of these modes and then bend the
rules to create some fantastic art shots.
Digital cameras are a funny lot. Some come with all the nuts and bolts you could
possibly need to take a shot that’s not only interesting but also mind-boggling.
Others come with an odd assortment of stuff that can take comparable shots
after you fool around with them to see how they work.
Take, for instance, the point-and-shoot models — yes, some are very power-
ful (5MP or more) — that have no manual modes. (Manual modes allow you
to change the f-stop or shutter speed yourself in the little knobs at the top of
the body, within the menu on the LCD screen. These controls open your pho-
tographic world so that you can use a multitude of aperture openings and
shutter speeds without the limitations of the point-and-shoots. For more on 
f-stops and shutter speeds, see Chapter 6.) Tweaking with a point-and-shoot,
where everything is preset, can be done but only by tricking the camera —
say, setting your shutter speed to stay open for a second but being limited to
only shooting in a dark space. Remember that if the shutter is left open for a
long time, no matter what your aperture is, your exposure will turn to white
because of too much light.
So the modes do it for you, right? You really don’t need anything but the auto
settings to be a great photographer? Well, in some ways, how well they really
do work is pretty incredible. But much of the time, you want more — more
setting choices, that is — especially the more you photograph.
With film and digital point-and-shoot cameras, you have many automatic 
settings from which to choose that do affect your f-stops (how wide your
lens opens) and shutter speeds (how long the shutter stays open).
Every time you set your camera in an auto mode, it calculates an f-stop and
shutter speed.
You can set both your shutter speed and your f-stop manually using the
M mode. When doing so, you’ll also want to refer to the camera’s light meter
to make sure that the exposure is correct. Your camera will use the EV —
the exposure value — to let you know if there’s too much or too little light.
Then you can adjust the f-stop or shutter speed to get the exposure that
you want.

On some point-and-shoot models, the only way
to adjust the shutter speed is via choices within
a limited set of values that are controlled as a 
setting. They can’t be adjusted as a mode (by
turning the knob on the body of your camera).
Most camera modes are on the external portion
of your camera. Look for a knob (as shown in
Figure 11-1) with tiny pictures of each mode drawn
on it. Sometimes this portion of your camera is
called a programmed image control zone.
You can tweak any of your digital camera’s 
settings for special effects, but first you
have to introduce yourself to them.
The following list describes the modes
on your digital camera, explaining how you
would traditionally use each and giving you
hints for tweaking those modes to achieve
a different type of effect:
 Auto (A): Use this mode in places
with good lighting, sun or shade,
during the daylight hours and in
shots with little or no action. Put 
masculine shadows (for a masculine
effect) over subjects by shooting into
the sun.
 Portrait: This mode is perfect when
you want a clear shot of your sub-
ject’s face up close. Figure 11-2
shows a woman photographed in 
portrait mode. Soften the look of 
animals by shooting them up close
in portrait mode.
 Landscape: When you’re shooting to
the horizon, with lots of distance to
cover and you want it all to come out
sharp, use the landscape mode.
 Close-up or macro: For those times
when you want one or two objects in
focus and everything else in the back-
ground/foreground blurred, the macro
mode is your friend. You can teach
botany with this handy feature on
many camera models. Figure 11-3
shows clearly a flower’s stigma, style,
anther, and filament.

Part II: The Photo Shoot 
 Action: This mode uses higher shutter speeds to stop action with little
or no blur. Figure 11-4 shows a pitcher in action. Action mode will give
you a shot that isn’t blurred when you’re moving, also.

Figure 11-4: Use action mode to stop action.
 Night: This mode will come in handy when you’re photographing a
scene at night without a flash. Remember to keep the camera very still
to avoid a blurry photo — this mode generally uses a slower shutter
speed. Figure 11-5 shows the added effect of wet streets shot at night.
Shoot at night when the streets are wet for extra-glimmery photos. 
Figure 11-5: Use night mode to take advantage of low light.
This list briefly describes the main settings that you need to tweak to achieve
great effects when shooting:

 Exposure compensation values:
Increases or decreases the
exposure, making the image
lighter or darker. Generally use
the default setting (what your
camera automatically has when
you turn it on). For stained glass
indoors backlit by bright sun-
light, drop it down by –1 EV
for bright colors, as shown in
Figure 11-6.
 White balance: Compensates
for the temperature (color) of
the existing light to prevent an
unwanted color tint to the photo. This is something Photoshop can also
do. Many models of digital cameras have a white balance setting for 
different types of light, both indoors and outdoors. See Chapter 8 for a
description of what the settings do. A camera set at automatic can sense
each of the light types — fluorescent, tungsten, and sunlight — but you
can set to the daylight mode inside with fluorescent lights on and get no
correction, that is yellow, in your shot.
 ISO: Increasing the ISO setting alters the sensitivity of the camera’s
sensor to capture more light
quickly — crystal clear if you
set it low (100 or 200) with a
greater chance of blur in low
light, and grainy if you set it
high (above 400). If you shoot
for special effects, anything
goes here; you just have to
experiment. Use high ISO
speeds like 1600 to pick up
reflected color that happens in
low-light situations.
 Color: Some cameras offer a
choice between sRGB and
Adobe RGB as the color space,
and some also offer faux sepia
and black-and-white (B&W) set-
tings. Use Adobe RGB if you’ll
be working in an image editing
program; sRGB if not. Shoot into
the sun at dusk in black-and-
white mode for mysterious
shadows and wild light, as in
Figure 11-7. Chapter 9 covers
shooting in B&W.

222
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
 Focus zone: Uses the designated area of the image as the point for 
autofocus. Adjust the focus point if the subject is off center in the
frame. Use low f-stop settings to get a focused off-center subject and
a blurry background.
 Exposure metering setting: This changes how much light your camera
uses for a shot. Most digital and film cameras use the lighting through-
out your whole frame. Some digital camera models let you reset this so
that only the light from the
center (or just a spot in the
center) is used. For example,
use this for a clear shot of the
moon. Set your camera to
center-weight at night and put
something moving and well-lit in
the center of your frame — it
will look as if it’s wrapped in cel-
lophane. The flag (taken at night
without a flash) in Figure 11-8
was shot with the focus zone set
for center-focus, the gathering
place for all the light.
Playing with Light
You can trick the light meter of your camera to enhance your photo by giving
it better color and more depth. Usually your camera assesses what it sees in
terms of light while you press your shutter halfway down. If you keep holding
it, the camera will remember the first place you took the reading.
You can press your shutter halfway down to set the autofocus and exposure,
and then point your camera in another direction while you keep holding the
button halfway down. You might, for example, set the camera while aiming at
a brightly lit area, and then actually shoot while aimed at an area more dimly
lighted, thereby producing an underexposed photo.
To create a special effect from how your camera perceives light, press the
shutter halfway down in one place and move to another place to shoot a 
picture, like this:
1. Set your camera to auto mode.
2. Turn off the flash.
3. Sit by a window.
4. Point your camera out the window so that your entire frame is in 
daylight.
5. Press the shutter release halfway down.
Figure 11-8: Use a center-weight exposure.

6. Point the camera inside the room to where there is some color or a
little light (less than what was out the window).
7. Press the shutter button all the way down.
Congratulations! You just messed around with your camera’s light meter.
Experiment with the light meter and the settings and modes (see the pre-
ceding section) in as many ways as you can to see what your camera can
and can’t do. The images in Figure 11-9 show that by focusing on a spot in the
shade and then moving your camera to shoot your composition as you want
it framed, your image is brightened up significantly. The image on the left in
Figure 11-9 is not as bright as the image on the right.
Figure 11-9: Play with the light meter to brighten images.
Come Get ’Yer Effects Here!
In the previous sections of this chapter, I explain how to manipulate your
camera’s settings, modes, and light meter (tools used generally to achieve
a “good” photograph) to achieve artsy effects your viewers will find unex-
pected and wonderful. But there are other ways to capture special effects
while shooting photos — including using time lapse and special filters. 
I show you some of these tricks in this section.
Double exposures
Double exposures are a funny lot. Love ’em and have your camera snapping
two or more shots on the same frame of film. A double exposure occurs
when your film camera takes two pictures without advancing the film.
223
Chapter 11: Achieving Creative Results When Shooting

224
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Figure 11-10 shows a double expo-
sure shot at dusk without a tripod of
birds flying out of a palm tree. To
combine multiple digital images to
create a double exposure, you have
to use an image editing program,
such as Photoshop. See Chapter 13
for more about combining images
digitally.
In order for the frame (which was
exposed to light twice because the
shutter opened to take the two shots
that were imprinted on it) not to be
overexposed — that is, turn white — set your exposure compensation to –1
(see Chapter 9).
You can also take triple exposures and more. It’s best to do this at dusk or at
night, though, because one frame can only take so much light before it turns
white.
Panoramic shots
A panorama is generally constructed from multiple images taken side by side
(or up and down) that are then stitched together in the darkroom or digitally.
Figure 11-11 shows a sample panorama. There are film cameras available that
specialize in panoramas, rotating the lens to expose a long strip of film, but
when shooting digitally, you need to combine exposures in an image editing
(or dedicated panorama) program. I recommend using a tripod and manual
exposure when capturing frames to use in a panorama, and allowing at least
15 percent overlap on each side for proper alignment.
Figure 11-11: Use a wide angle lens or zoom to 100mm or more to grab a vast area of land and/or sea.
Figure 11-10: Combine two image imprints
within the same shot.

Panoramic shots are not only land-
scapes (horizontal) but can also be
vertical shots, like architectural and
sculptural elements. For more about
panoramas, see Chapter 13.
Reflections
Reflections offer your viewers two
ways to see the world: the real image
and the one that’s reflected. The dis-
tortion of a subject can vary, depend-
ing on the reflective material. You’ve
probably seen reflections on water,
from the almost mirror effect it can
produce in the right light when there
is no wind, to interesting distortions
on a sea of light chop. Other materi-
als reflect light, too, as shown in the
coffee pot in Figure 11-12.
Second on the reflection front is the
reflection of glass. To be sure, there
are the ins and outs of light bouncing
through, around, and among glass
windows, doors, and panels. Last is
the glory of reflection, that of a string
of mountains reflected on the water
in Figure 11-13.
Zooming while shooting
Zooming while shooting can be a
tricky proposition, but the effects are
unreal — literally. Figure 11-14 shows
the sense of motion created by
zooming with the shutter open.
(Don’t look at it too long, or you’ll
get motion sickness.)
To engage in zoom play — that is, moving your zoom in (and out if you want)
while shooting — you gotta be quick. Set your shutter speed to at least 1⁄30. To
do this, shoot in Tv mode and set your shutter speed by cranking the dial on
your camera.

Intentional lack of focus
Have you ever tried to turn off your
autofocus? Seems like we’ve become
so enamored with it that we forget
that we don’t have to use it. Experi-
ments conducted by creating blur
can create results that are much like
a soft pillow. Matching a pillows’ soft-
ness in Figure 11-15 are the toddler’s
eyes and face that are just slightly
out of focus. Soft focus can be an
extremely flattering effect, especially
as we age. You might also want the
camera to be slightly out of focus to
create a great background into which
you can drop another image. Take a slightly blurred photo of a building, crop
out everything except the blurry building, and voilá!
Figure 11-15: Slightly burred features speak
softly to the viewer.

Intentional underexposure/overexposure
You can read tons about how to properly expose a shot. However, you can
create some really cool shots by breaking those standards — purposefully
under- or overexposing for a great in-camera art effect.
 Underexposed: Compare the two shots shown in Figure 11-16. On the
left is a photo that would be good had it been properly exposed. As it is,
the detail in the image is lost because of a lack of contrast. On the right,
however, slightly underexposing the image allows the subject to remain
a dark mystery and prevents the sky from becoming featureless white.
 Overexposed: Compare the two images in Figure 11-17. On the left, over-
exposing has reduced the detail in the photo’s subject, the hotel, and
allowed the sky to become a featureless void, neither of which makes this a
particularly compelling image. On the right, overexposing minimizes much
of the detail of the house in the background, allowing the detail of the
subject, the foliage, to remain prominent. (You might also find that when
shooting greenery, slightly overexposing helps you capture more detail.)
Figure 11-16: Sometimes underexposure hurts (left), and sometimes it helps (right).

Chapter 11: Achieving Creative Results When Shooting

228
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
Photographing in the direct sun with long shutter speeds will make your
photos look as if they’ve been hit by a snowstorm (which washes out
the subject).
Figure 11-17: Overexposing can eliminate detail (left) or highlight part of an image (right).
For a special effect, slow down the shutter speed (on dSLR or SLR cameras)
so that the lens stays open for almost one-half second. This can produce
some interesting effects.
Making flowing water turn to silk
Shots that have flowing water turn to silk — on rocks, over bumps and curves,
and through tunnels — are the shots that are always popular. To get flowing
water looking like flowing velvet, you need to film in low light:
 At dusk or dawn
 In fog or in winter
 When the sun is low on the horizon
 In a shady spot
Take a walk to a fountain during one of these days and bring your tripod.
You’ll find an adventure in shutter speed awaiting you.
dSLR models and SLR models offer time exposure using the Tv mode, as I
explain here.

Load your SLR film camera with ISO 100 speed film or set your dSLR camera
to ISO 100 or 200.
1. Find a place by a body of moving water that’s flowing with bubbly
excitement where it’s shady — or better yet, at dusk when the sun
has just fallen below the horizon.
2. Frame your picture.
Set your camera on a tripod and compose the image.
3. Set your camera to Tv mode, the shutter priority mode.
4. Set your camera to a slow shutter speed — say, 1⁄60 of a second.
5. Set your camera’s timer so that the camera doesn’t shake when you
try to push the shutter button.
Look for the little clock icon/button at the top of your camera.
6. Release your shutter and wait for the camera to take a picture.
7. Reset your camera to a slower shutter speed — say, 1⁄30 of a second.
8. Repeat Steps 4 through 6, using a slower shutter speed each time,
until the flowing water looks like velvet.
The result is shown in Figure 11-18, which was captured with a shutter
speed of 0.6 seconds at f/22.
Use low light when filming anything with your shutter speed open longer
than 1⁄60 of a second.

Part II: The Photo Shoot 
For art photos that are correctly exposed, rather than calculating a shutter
speed and an aperture, let your camera do some of the work by choosing the
Av or Tv mode. You select an aperture and the camera picks an appropriate
shutter speed (Av) or you select your desired shutter speed and let the camera
determine the best aperture (Tv).
Using filters
Camera filters help make a better picture when you are shooting during the
day because the sun’s glare can affect both the color and the details of your
subjects and backgrounds. dSLR and SLR cameras have a ring around which
you screw the filter onto your lens.
There are dozens of types of filters, each with a specific function:
 UV/skylight: Ultraviolet (UV) filters get rid of the haze and UV light that
your sensor or film picks up but that you can’t see. This is the most
common kind of filter that most professionals have with them at all times.
 Polarizing: These filters reduce the sun’s glare. They also help if you’re
shooting through glass. These filters give improved clarity and color bal-
ance to your photographs. Figure 11-19 compares an image taken with a
polarizing filter (on the top) and no filter (on the bottom).
Figure 11-19: Compare using a polarizing filter (top) and no filter (bottom).

 Neutral density: These filters reduce the amount of light that gets to
your lens. In the earlier section, “Making flowing water turn to silk,” I dis-
cuss how there’s a period around dusk where the light is just right so
that you can keep your shutter open a bit longer. Using this filter blocks
out some of the light so that you can keep your shutter open longer —
long enough for water to turn to silk in broad daylight!
 Close-up filters: Also known as a magnifying glass that you can attach to
your lens, close-up filters are pretty nifty and cheap, but the quality can
be dicey, with blur and whatnot.
 Color conversion: These filters stop certain wavelengths of light from
reaching your film or sensor, thus changing the color in your entire
photo. These are actually colored glass that you put over the lens of
your dSLR or SLR camera to change the color of your photo.
Yellow: Yellow works with the sun’s color to make your shots look more
vivid (see the leftmost image in Figure 11-20). If you live near L.A. (like I
do) or some other hazy metropolis and you want a landscape that frees
up some of the yellow haze, this filter will help.
Blue: Blue enhances the sky and/or water to the way they’d appear in a
dream. Use the filter to let the blues from the lens soak in to both sky
and water by looking for rays of sunlight striking directly on water and
shooting so part of the sun’s reflection on the water is evident (center
image in Figure 11-20). This causes a part of the water to turn yellow and
white, adding more tones of color to the enhanced blues that are every-
where else in your shot.
Red: A red filter heats up your environment, kind of like if you were living
on an angry red planet. The rightmost image in Figure 11-20 shows the
Mars-like landscape that a red filter can provide.
Color conversion filters can be improvised by using transparent or
translucent Mylar or plastic — the same stuff that some report covers
are made from. You can get this stuff at an office supply store.
Figure 11-20: Photographic filters change the actual light that hits your camera’s sensor or film,
unlike filtering later in Photoshop. 
231
Chapter 11: Achieving Creative Results When Shooting

232
Part II: The Photo Shoot 
 Special effects: These filters come in all types of configurations and
colors. There are pop filters of bright red, blue, and green that you can
use separately or together. There are also soft-diffused filters, which
change the light to create effects such as fog.
Diffusion: Pictures taken with diffusion are usually used on shots
of women, but you can use them on anything you want to soften. For
instance, you can soften even the hardest metal and dark colored sub-
jects taken at midday with a diffusion filter.
Use a woman’s stocking over your camera lens for a similar effect to a
diffusion filter.
Infrared: An infrared filter gives
images a surreal, other-worldly
quality, as shown in Figure 11-21.
The filter itself is really dark —
to block all visible light — so
when you use film, it has to be a
special film that can record the
image. To see whether you can
shoot infrared with your digital
camera, point a television remote
control at the lens, press and
hold down the shutter button,
and take a picture. If you can
see the light in the photo, you
can probably take infrared
images with an appropriate
filter (such as a Hoya R72). You
can tweak your digital camera
by bumping up your ISO setting
to 800 or above and bumping up
your exposure compensation to
at least +1 EV. If your camera
doesn’t offer that level of control
over the settings, try the Night
Portrait mode for the longest
exposure. 
Star: This type of filter makes it
look as though points of light radiate outward from any light source in
your shot. A star filter makes any scene more glittery and glamorous, as
shown in Figure 11-22.

Using Software to

Art Photos

In this part . . .
T
his part covers all things Photoshop. For the
lowdown on repairing or jazzing up old photos,
Chapter 12 is your guide to Photoshop tools and
techniques for restoring faded color and eliminat-
ing the ravages of time, like creases, scratches,
and dust. Peruse Chapter 13 to see how to use
Photoshop to merge images into a single, giant
photograph. Chapter 14 presents Photoshop
layers, which are a great tool for creating digital
art photography. And because Photoshop offers
so many creative and tempting ﬁlters, I dedicate a
whole chapter here to them (Chapter 15).

Adding New Life to Old Photos
In This Chapter

C
limb into a time machine by going up into your attic and pulling down
those dusty old photos. There’s gold up in them thar attics. What you
can do in Photoshop with the old photos you find — tweak them for color,
repair them, make them sepia tone, and so on — is nothing less than putting
your relative’s (or someone else’s unknown relative’s) past into the present
and making it crystal clear. In this chapter, I cover auto and manual tweaks as
well as adjustments to black-and-white (B&W) and color photos.
Taking an old photo and scanning and repairing it saves its life and
can extend its life far into the future. Paper and film fade and
are fragile. Conserving old photos helps ensure that these
histories and precious images are around for generations
to come.
Using Automatic Adjustments 
to Refresh Older Prints
Retro-based art — including photographs — is a
saleable commodity because lots of folks want some
piece of the past. Although recycling formal portraits is
good, snapshots are just fine, especially if they contain
nostalgic elements.
After you pull out your old photos and scan them, you can use the following
Auto commands in Photoshop to try to refresh them and make them more
clear and colorful. You can find these tools via Image➪Adjustments. These
adjustments are one-size-fits-all; that is, you don’t have any sliders or options
to mess with.

238
Part III: Photoshop Art: Using Software to Enhance or Create Art Photos 
 Auto Contrast: Use this option when you want to adjust contrast only —
that is, make dark pixels darker and light pixels lighter. It does nothing
with the color of your image but can really liven up a B&W shot. Figure 12-1
shows the improvement you can get with some images using the Auto
Contrast option.
Figure 12-1: Try using Auto Contrast to improve the tonal range in your photograph.
 Auto Levels: Use this option to cut away some of the pure white and
pure black that your photo might have from under- or overexposure.
After that, it readjusts the blackest black and whitest white of your
photo to even out the contrast. The best part of this command is that
it also works on color photos, working especially well with those that
have good uniformity of color (lots of shades) so that Photoshop can
find the shades to make each shade distinguishable from the other.
(See the upcoming example of using Auto Levels.)
 Auto Color: Use this command when you want to neutralize your mid-
tones. Say you have a red cast over your entire print: Using Auto Color
removes the excess red. Use the Auto Color correction to specify shad-
ows and highlights that you want to reduce.

• For B&W conversion photos: Choose Enhance Monochromatic
Contrast.
• For color: Choose Enhance Per Channel Contrast.
For more about color tweaking with this tool, see “Using Manual
Adjustments for Fine-Tuning.”
You can also have Auto Color find dark and light colors as well as keep
what you set as a default mode.
Over the years, age can flatten colors in a print. You’ve undoubtedly seen
the yellowing effect that really happens fast with newspaper. With photos, it
happens slower (the paper is better), but the deterioration still results in a
yellow midtone. Photoshop can sense the plethora of yellows and fix this
imbalance by adding blues via the Auto Color command. Mind you, I’m not
talking about repairing damage here (later sections deal with that) but rather
fading and color shift.
239
Chapter 12: Adding New Life to Old Photos
Whose photo is this?
There are many laws governing the world of pho-
tography telling us about the fair use of an image
after it’s produced. In a nutshell (and not substi-
tuting for consultation with a legal professional),
regarding photos, fair use refers to the rights a
photographer has and the details of permissions
that someone else — who wants to use and/or
reproduce the photo in question — must agree
to that protects the rights of the picture-taker. If
you have any questions about the old photo-
graph(s) you have in hand, discuss them with
your attorney. Although this issue can get com-
plex, here’s some general information that can
help you decide whether you want to use a photo
as saleable art:
 A photo you didn’t take: If you have a pho-
tograph you bought at an antique store or
found rummaging through your old photos
that’s decades old and has no identifiable
subjects (or if it’s a photo of yourself taken
by someone else), the original owner of that
photo is not likely to be able to identify it (or
would even want to). Use these photos at
your own discretion and/or talk to a copy-
right lawyer if you’re considering selling it
or publishing it.
 A photo that you took of someone else: The
same rules apply for old photo portraits as
for current ones: You need to have the sub-
ject sign a release. If you’ve got photos of
deceased relatives that you or someone in
your family photographed and that you want
to publish and/or sell, you should contact
all the estate heirs of the relative to get
permission.
 A photo taken before 1923: If you’ve got a
photo that was taken before 1923, it’s pretty
assured that you can republish it or sell it
regardless of who’s in the picture or who
took it. Again, this is not set in stone, and
there are situations where this may not be
the case, so talk to a copyright attorney.

Part III: Photoshop Art: Using Software to Enhance or Create Art Photos 
See the improvement after using the Auto Levels adjustment on this vintage
photo, as shown before (left) and after (right) in Figure 12-2. It looks great
now because the yellow is gone and there’s more contrast in the midtones.
(Take a look at the browns in the hair in both pictures, and you’ll see more
shades of brown and more detail).
Figure 12-2: Period photo before and after using Auto Levels in Photoshop.
If you don’t like the results of your tweaking, choose Edit➪Undo (or press Ô+Z/
Mac or Ctrl+Z/Windows) and try again using a different command or technique.
Using Manual Adjustments for Fine-Tuning
You can also tweak parts of your picture manually to fine-tune specific areas of
an image. To the rescue come Photoshop’s Dodge and Burn tools. Use these
tools to lighten, darken, and refine details in an image. Photoshop also has fil-
ters that you can use, such as Despeckle (Filter➪Noise➪Despeckle) and Dust &
Scratches (Filter➪Noise➪Dust & Scratches) to minimize grain in an old photo.
Dodge
Use the Dodge tool of the Tools palette to lighten something dark in a photo.
You can choose to lighten midtones, highlights, or shadows. Too, you can

choose the exposure you want by typing in a value in the Exposure box at
the top of the Photoshop window. (It appears after you click the Dodge tool
of the Tools palette.)
When you click and hold down the Dodge tool, a drop-down menu presents
you with a couple of other tools: the Burn tool and the Sponge tool. Read
about them in upcoming sections.
Finding an old B&W surfing photo from the ’60s is a jewel from the sea, but
tweaking it carefully using all aspects of the Dodge tool is indeed a surfing
safari. I do that in these steps, to show you what you can achieve with this
handy tool that makes dark areas lighter:
1. Choose a picture to tweak and study it, pin-
pointing the areas where you want to see
more highlights.
For example, look for areas with too much
black shadow, like that under and around
the surfer’s body in Figure 12-3.
2. On the Options bar, select a brush tip size
that’s appropriate for the shadow area you
need to lighten.
For this example, I use a master diameter of
about 75 px (pixels).
3. Create a duplicate layer by choosing Layer➪Duplicate Layer.
Creating a new layer keeps your original from getting messed up, which
enables you to go back to the original image layer, should your correc-
tions go horribly wrong. For more about layers, see Chapter 14.
4. To begin, choose Shadows for Range and an exposure of about 20% if
your photo is too dark.
5. Brush over the dark spots of the picture. Rub (click and drag) around
the dark spots until you see more distinction among the shades.
If you see a little too much white, don’t worry because you’ll correct
that in a later step. Or if you go way overboard, fade what you did by
using the Edit➪Fade command. In the surf photo, I use all size brushes
and switch options often to get the maximum contrast between the surf-
board and water, and the water and white caps. I’m looking for drama
here, maximum splash with lighter gray tones and good distinction
between water and surfer/surfboard.
Feel free to change the brush size and switch back and forth from shad-
ows to highlights to midtones in the Range drop-down menu. And use
different exposures by typing in different values in the Exposure Value
box next to the Range options.
241
Chapter 12: Adding New Life to Old Photos
Figure 12-3: Use the Dodge tool
to lighten dark areas.

242
Part III: Photoshop Art: Using Software to Enhance or Create Art Photos 
6. Open your Layers palette by
choosing Window➪Layers.
7. Slide the Opacity tool until you
get an image you like (one with
more highlights to cancel out
the dark shadows and increase
the distinction among shades,
or contrast).
The results in Figure 12-4 are
easy to see because I chose a
photo that had many areas of
darker tones that needed slight
lightening.
In Photoshop, some command names (in a menu) are followed by ellipsis points.
This just means that when you select one of these, a dialog box opens request-
ing that you choose some manual options. But just over a dozen of Photoshop’s
filters do not have ellipsis points after their names in the Filter menu. Photo-
shop automatically applies those filters to your image with preset values.
Burn tool
The opposite of the Dodge tool, the Burn tool darkens. With the Burn tool,
which is also found in the Tools palette, you can darken highlights, midtones,
and shadows and also change the exposure of the tool while you work. All
these options are located on the Options bar and appear after clicking the
Burn tool from the Tools palette.
On the left in Figure 12-5 is a faded image of a plane, faded especially where
the plane has been damaged (see image on the left). By using the Burn tool,
I can darken the damaged parts of the plane so that they have better contrast
among the tones (see image on the right).
Figure 12-5: Improved a faded image (left) with the Burn tool (result, right).
Figure 12-4: Using the Dodge tool can really
liven a vintage photo.

Smart Sharpen/Unsharp Mask commands
Tweaking using the Unsharp Mask filter (Filter➪Sharpen➪Unsharp Mask) or the
Smart Sharpen (Sharpen➪Smart Sharpen) filter — new in Photoshop CS2 —
requires that you set values that cause the pixels to change color so that your
picture loses some of its blur. For the finest distinction of the edges, choose
Lens Blur from the Remove drop-down menu of the Smart Sharpen dialog box.
Unsharp Mask is the choice for sharpening in Photoshop CS, but it doesn’t let
you control the sharpening of the highlights and shadows individually.
Sponge tool
The Sponge tool (located on the Tools palette) changes an area of your photo’s
color saturation. You can saturate the color or desaturate by any percentage
(called the flow in the menu bar).
Figure 12-6 shows marching cadets in red (and leaves a viewer nostalgic for
old Kodachrome film). The picture, scanned from a positive, was taken in the
’60s. The only part of the picture I want to change is the bright blue car in the
background (image on the top), which I can do with the Sponge tool. Wiping
the car with the Sponge tool desaturates it so that it blends in better with the
gray tones of the building in the background (image on the bottom). Using the
Sponge tool provides the perfect tweak for an interesting picture — not too
much so as to destroy its integrity and period-feel, yet enough so that the car
doesn’t distract as much from the marching cadets.

Part III: Photoshop Art: Using Software to Enhance or Create Art Photos 
Dust & Scratches filter
Choose Filter➪Noise➪Dust & Scratches to quickly remove scratches and
creases. You can use this tool to rid your photo of light scratches, dust
specks, and slight folds. It does a fairly good job of eliminating the pesky
little dots that sometimes cover your old photos. The Dust & Scratches
dialog box (see Figure 12-7) shows the Radius and Threshold values I set for 
a picture of secretaries. At high radius values, the image starts to blur, so I
moved the sliders while looking for the least amount of blur in the picture
where most of the small scratches are removed. Compare the two images
(the image on the left is the original) to see that after all is said and done, the
Dust & Scratches filter does a pretty good job of removing the little beasts
without compromising your picture much.
Figure 12-7: Use the Dust & Scratches filter to eliminate most small imperfections.
Blur tool
The Blur tool is located to the left of the Dodge/Burn/Sponge tools. The Blur
tool, um, blurs. By that, I mean that the Blur tool is great when you want to
smooth out an edge in a picture that contains a copied and pasted element
or an area that has received a bit too many tweaks that you want to smooth
out. You can blur with any size brush or strength when the normal mode is
selected. I use it most often to smooth out where one object meets another in
a picture — areas that can look unnatural after tweaks with other Photoshop
tools.

Color Balance
The next feature I use is the Color
Balance adjustment (Image➪
Adjustments➪Color Balance), which
uses sliders that move from cyan to
red, magenta to green, and yellow to
blue. You have the option to tweak
all tones — shadows, midtones, and
highlights. In Figure 12-8, the cute
pooches (Fido and Cody) could use a
little bit of color balancing, and the
grass could be made greener.
Figure 12-9 shows my color balance
values — for shadows, midtones,
and highlights — to color the dogs’
world. I’m looking to get some green grass here, as well as some color in the
old car in the background.
To merge the changes to the existing photo — to make them more subtle —
I set the opacity in the Layers palette to 70%, as shown in Figure 12-10.
Figure 12-9: I rework the color balance to get more green.

changes.
The picture shown in Figure 12-11
shows an improvement in color over
the before picture (Figure 12-10). The
color balance only goes so far in
adjusting color, however.
Removing a horrible
shadow
When you need to remove a horrible
shadow — like that seen to the left of
the secretary in Figure 12-7 — use
the Magnetic Lasso tool and then the
Clone Stamp tool to replace a dark blotch made with a crude flash. (See more
on this in the section “Healing Damaged Photos.”) The Clone Stamp tool
copies pixels from one area (the source point) to another (the area that needs
repair). Notice the bevels in the wooden wall behind the secretary: They’re
fairly even. To start, I click the Clone Stamp tool and select a source point by
Option+clicking (on a Mac; in Windows, you Alt+click to define the source
point) in a clean place on the wall at the meeting point of bevel and flat wall;
Figure 12-11: Color balance tweaks change
color tones only so much.

I then drag to the right (that’s the
area I’m painting over). In doing so,
I am able to carry the bevel evenly all
the way to the secretary’s shoulder
where the horrible shadow once was.
Figure 12-12 shows the shadow
removed from the area to the left of
the secretary.
When you use the Clone Stamp tool,
you can click and drag while holding
the Shift key and moving the tool.
When you do, you get a straight hori-
zontal line if you move your mouse
horizontally (and a vertical line if
you click and drag up or down).
Healing Damaged Photos
Time takes its toll on all things, and
old photos and negatives can suffer a
lot of damage from water (mold or
mildew), pests (mice and silverfish),
and storage problems that cause
damage (like when photos stacked in
a box stick to each other). Many of the bigger challenges facing you come in
the form of scratches, tears, and bends. Figure 12-13 shows just such a print.
This print can be fixed with trusty old Photoshop.
Figure 12-13: You can fix this.

Part III: Photoshop Art: Using Software to Enhance or Create Art Photos 
Using this photo as a model in the “Making the Corrections” section, I show
you how to touch it up so that it’s ready for printing. I scanned it first to have
a digital image to work with. Note: Achieving good resolution from the very
beginning — when you scan — can’t be overstated. Resolution is important
because the more information (that is, the higher the resolution) you have
in an image, the better the detail; the better the detail you start with, the
better the quality you have to work with. Think of it like bed sheets: The
higher the thread count, the better and softer the sheet. Lower is thinner . . .
and not as good.
Cropping before you fix
Sometimes a photo needs a little more help than
just color adjustment. If your print has an area on
its edge (not in the middle) that’s damaged, as the
image on the left does (see the lower-left corner),
you can either cut out the damage with the Crop
tool, as I do here in the following steps, or fix it by
following the steps in “Making the Corrections.”
1. Open the image you want to crop.
2. Select the Crop tool from the Toolbox.
3. With the Crop tool, select the area to cut
out, and then click the Crop tool icon on the
toolbar to initiate the crop.
If you want to save what you have at this
point, just click Save. The image on the right
in the figure shows the cropping in progress.

I use a Hewlett-Packard (HP) Scanjet type of scanner. It comes with a negative/
positive reader that is merely a long light table upon which you slide your
negative/positive into and then set the mechanism into the scanner bed.
That might be different from yours, although the basic steps are similar. 
If you come across something weird, consult the documentation that came
with your scanner software or consult a copy of Scanners For Dummies,
Second Edition, by Mark L. Chambers (Wiley).
Making the Corrections
Open the scanned image that needs a little love and cosmetic aid. Then use
the tools in Photoshop to help correct whatever problem is at hand — a tear,
a scratch, a bend. In this example, part of the emulsion of the print is gone,
leaving the white stock of the print paper showing through. Not good. To cor-
rect this issue, I use the Clone Stamp and Healing Brush tools. Remember:
You can find these tools in the Toolbox.
1. Using the Lasso tool or another selection tool, click and drag around
the area that you want to fix, as shown in Figure 12-14.
Selecting an area can be tricky. If you aren’t familiar with using the selec-
tion tools, I recommend practicing doing so before trying this exercise
or consulting Photoshop CS2 All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, by
Barbara Obermeier (Wiley).
Figure 12-14: First select the area to repair.
249

Part III: Photoshop Art: Using Software to Enhance or Create Art Photos 
2. With the Clone Stamp tool, click inside the drop-down list in the
Photoshop Options bar to pick a brush size for your cleanup.
You can also get the same window to appear by right-clicking (if you have a
two-button mouse) or Control+clicking (for you one-button mouse users).
Figure 12-15 shows some of the brush types you can select from and the
slider bars to change the brush’s diameter and hardness.
Figure 12-15: Choose a brush by texture; smooth for sky, textured for trees.
You use the Clone Stamp tool to take pixels from an undamaged area in
the photograph and replicate them in the damaged area you identify.
You have to determine what brush size will cover the area you want to
clone. If the damaged area is small — say, for example, a long sliver of an
area along one edge of the photo — choose a smallish size (such as 20 px)
to maintain detail. If a large portion of the photo is damaged, like part of
the sky in Figure 12-14, less detail is needed, so a larger size (such as 80 px)
is appropriate.
3. Still using the Clone Stamp tool, find an undamaged area that’s similar
in color and texture to the area that you’re repairing and Option+click
(Mac) or Alt+click (Windows) to set the point (Photoshop calls it a source
point) from which you’ll copy (clone); then move your mouse over the
area you want to fix.
You now have the good pixels with which you can repair the damage.
4. Carefully color in the area, making sure that you copy only the area
that you want to fix.
If you accidentally pick up some of another object, reset your clone point
by pressing Option/Alt and clicking your mouse over an area that includes
what you’re cloning.

5. Repeat Steps 2–4 with the Clone Stamp tool until you repair the entire
area that needs fixing.
The whole process is a series of pick-up-what-you-need actions you
achieve by constantly repeating Steps 3 and 4.
6. Deselect the area that you had been fixing by pressing Ô+D/Ctrl+D.
Select another area (or the same area again if you were adding a back-
ground, such as sky, and if you want something to go over part of that
background, like a tree).
7. Clean up the edges of the old selection area with the Healing Brush or
the Spot Healing Brush tool (Photoshop CS2).
8. Repeat Steps 2–7 to repair any other damaged areas in the photo.
Use an appropriate part of the undamaged area to serve as the new
source area for the Clone Stamp tool!
9. Crop the picture.
The finished product is shown in Figure 12-16. In this step, you can
choose to take away borders or insignias, names of places, and other
specific details that old photos sometimes contain.
Figure 12-16: All touched up and ready for the Photoshop CS2 Smart 
Sharpen feature.
Old photos scanned at higher resolutions will print almost perfectly, even if
enlarged several times. Find more about enlarging your photos in Photoshop

Tweaking Color in the Digital World
In this section, I show you how to take an old picture and make its color even
better by using Color Balance tools. Figure 12-17 was taken in the late 1950s,
although most of the color in the picture has remained (fortunately); that
means that the tweaks should be minor for an ideal picture (that is, if you
want to make them at all). Although some people like old pictures just as they
are — faded and yellowed (a nostalgia
thing) — you might have to eliminate
creases and folds, which you can take
out with the Clone Stamp and Healing
Brush tools, as shown in the earlier
section, “Healing Damaged Photos.”
To tweak the color in the image shown
in the “Cropping before you fix” side-
bar, follow these steps:
1. To adjust the color, choose
Image➪Adjustments➪Auto
Color.
2. To adjust the color more, choose
Edit➪Fade Auto Color and play
with the slider bar until you get
what you want.
I want to play with the reds at this
point, deepening them a little. 
3. To adjust a particular color,
choose Image➪Adjustments➪
Color Balance and play with
the midtones.
Figure 12-17 shows the Color Balance sliders I
set to get deep Christmas reds in the outfits of
both Santa and the boy.
4. After you finish with color balancing, you
can finesse the rest of the image with the
Clone Stamp and the Healing Brush tools.
The steps in the section “Making the
Corrections” show you how to use these tools.
The final picture after edits with the Clone
Stamp and the Healing Brush tools is shown
in Figure 12-18.

Enhancing Sepia and Other Tones
A photograph with a sepia tone is a black-
and-white photograph that has tones of
brown in it. Photographers can control
the sepia toning with film in the darkroom,
and you can, too, with your computer.
Figure 12-19 is a B&W photo that I manip-
ulate to give it a sepia tone. To do this, I
use the same tools using the Images➪
Adjustment➪Color Balance command.
Instead of playing with the midtones, 
I adjust the highlights because I’m 
looking to pick up more details in the
background — the background is almost
all light toned (contains only highlights).
In the Tone Balance area, I select the
Highlights radio button and adjust the
three sliders, adding and taking away color
until I get the effect I want. I choose not
to check Preserve Luminosity because it
gives my picture too much bright contrast.
Here’s what happens: I can make out
some of the tree branches in the back-
ground, making the picture have more
depth as I move the values of the sliders
to those shown in Figure 12-20.
1. For the top slider bar, I shift
toward Red and away from Cyan
(a mixture of blue and green).
The red tones brighten up the pic-
ture a bit.
2. For the middle slider bar, I shift a
bit toward Magenta.
This gives more detail.
3. For the bottom slider bar, I play
with Yellow and Blue and then
decide to not change this (by click-
ing and dragging the slider bar to a
0 reading).
The slight red in the highlights gives a
subtle brown tone, resulting in a nice
sepia effect, as shown in Figure 12-21.

Part III: Photoshop Art: Using Software to Enhance or Create Art Photos 
The sliders in Photoshop’s Color Balance dialog box can make any tone that
affects the entire picture, turning it to shades of red, cyan, magenta, blue (see
Figure 12-22), yellow (see Figure 12-23), or any combination of these.

Enhancing Shadow, Highlights, 
Hue, and Saturation
There’s nothing like taking a picture
of a friend and finding it 30 years
later in a box. It’s a picture that says
wow with color, especially if it’s on
a negative that you thought you’d
never use. Even more exciting than
snapping the picture today is finding
an image that you snapped when
you were a kid, and not just any
image, but one on old Kodak 126
color negative film that scans onto
your computer like it was shot yes-
terday. Figure 12-24 shows an image
that was shot in the late 1960s on
some very tough film.
Although this picture is pretty good
as is because its color and contrast stayed in tact for over 40 years, you can
get it to print with hues of orange that will soak the paper on which it will be
cast. Here’s how to set this up for a print out of paradise.
To enhance shadow, highlights, hue, and saturation in a photograph, take any
photo with good exposure and follow these steps. (You need to experiment a
little, though, with the values that you choose in each step.)
1. In Photoshop, open the photograph and decide what repairs you want
to make.
2. Choose the Clone Stamp tool, Option-click on a clean spot nearby, and
then clean up specks of dust.
In Photoshop CS2, you can use the Spot Healing Brush tool of the
Tools palette (looks like a Tootsie Roll with a dashed ring around the
end of it). Photoshop calculates the surrounding colors and washes
away the spot.
For the Clone Stamp tool, I recommend a small brush setting to maintain
detail. To do this, slide the master diameter bar to get the brush size you
want. Because your brush size is going to be small, as are the areas you’re
correcting, you won’t need to use the Healing Brush tool.

very little of its color.

Part III: Photoshop Art: Using Software to Enhance or Create Art Photos 
3. Choose Image➪Adjustment➪Curves to deal with contrast, color — all
the tones at once — and highlights, midtones, shadows.
I recommend using the Curves dialog box here — instead of Auto
Levels — because of the sweeping manipulations you can make 
simultaneously.
There’s more to this dialog box than meets the eye. You can adjust
each curve channel by channel. Add a point on the curve by clicking
in the work area. Take away a point by clicking and dragging it off the
work area and using the Eyedropper tool to reset your black, gray,
and/or white points. (Say, if you click the picture with the black point
Eyedropper in an area lighter than black, you get a very dark picture
because you added lighter tones to the value from which Photoshop cal-
culates pure black.) Last, as you click your picture, you’ll see the values
of the input and output changing. Those values are actually the tonal
ranges as they’re read from the curve. Yes, they’re algebraic x and y
coordinates, that in effect associate the tonal value from a point on the
line to a point in your picture.
4. Choose Image➪Adjustment➪
Shadow/Highlight to open
the dialog box shown in
Figure 12-25.
This tool has to be one of
Photoshop’s most effective,
lightening dark images and dark-
ening light ones. The sliders in
the dialog box work best on
images where you have strong
backlighting. Use them also to
brighten shadows. To correct
your lighting, move the Amount
slider back and forth until you
get what you like. Watch out for
the hazy white that is created
when you overdo it. The Tonal
Width slider determines what
values are included in “shad-
ows” or “highlights” as you
adjust. The Radius slider con-
trols how large or small an area
of shadow or highlight must be
before it’s adjusted.
Figure 12-25: Lighten and darken here.

5. Choose Image➪Adjustments➪
Hue/Saturation to open
the dialog box shown
in Figure 12-26.
This dialog box — which you
use to make adjustments to
color — features sliders
and also an Edit drop-down
menu that shows the different
colors that you can adjust: red,
yellow, green, blue, cyan, and
magenta. I make most of the
values for each color in the positive range because the original picture
lost color and became dark — so I give it color and make the colors
lighter using these tools. I take away a tad of red to make the helmet
bright orange. I up the saturation a little bit because during printing, I
want more red and yellow ink to go to the helmet (and to the pattern in
the girl’s dress). That’s all I want to tweak because the dark background
of the fish and plants is appropriate for what the picture was intended to
do — make the subject look like she’s underwater.

Figure 12-27 shows the image after the tweaks. No more changes to this
image are necessary in preparation for printing for some printers, such as
a HP Photosmart (a printer series in which the colors are decided by the
printer itself so that the range of colors you choose in Photoshop has only a
nominal effect). The image might need more tweaks if it’s printed on different
printers. See Chapter 17 for more about printing.

Combining and Manipulating
Images
In This Chapter
 Merging files automatically in Photoshop
 Identifying color for use for picture backgrounds
 Using symmetry to create new pictures from photos
You can think of Photoshop as an image processing program in either two
or three dimensions. In two dimensions, Photoshop can take many photos
and place them side by side in a collage or montage. That you can discover in
this chapter. In three dimensions, Photoshop can meld one image on top of
another to create three-dimensional effects that awe. (No, no Twilight Zone
or Sixth Sense here, just old-fashioned photo layer manipulation
that’s been around ever since Photoshop introduced layers in
version 3.) That you can discover in Chapter 14.
The fun thing about Photoshop, of course, is that you
can manipulate images in all sorts of cool ways. Just
like in most any other application, such as Microsoft
Word, you can copy and paste images side by side
in a new document or add them to an existing one.
You can copy and paste tables, graphs, other
people’s pictures — even a picture of someone’s
kitchen sink — into Photoshop.
In this chapter, I show you how to position images using
Photoshop’s Photomerge. It can sew sections of a larger
photo into one cohesive image. Think of a broad, panoramic
landscape view that’s difficult to capture in one shot. With
Photoshop, you can take individual shots — sections, if you will — of that
scene and seam them into one wide, complete image. And you’re not limited
to horizontal images, either. For example, in this chapter, I show you how to
take pieces of a giant Tiki — a tall vertical image — and put them together to
make a large, whole picture of the entire Tiki.

260
Part III: Photoshop Art: Using Software to Enhance or Create Art Photos 
I also show you how to integrate backgrounds into photographs and how to
cut, copy, and rotate images to create symmetry that makes the items in your
photograph indistinguishable, but makes your photo itself interesting and
unusual.
Preserving Detail
The very first thing — the most important thing — that gives you make-or-
break prints is the fine detail in your image. Certainly there are images in
which you’ll use creative blurring techniques, but generally you’ll want to
preserve as much detail as possible. For more about managing the size of
your file so that your image’s detail won’t fall apart to noise, and so that your
image stays crystal clear from the time you take it to the time you tweak it to
the time you print it, see Chapter 18.
Cropping an image can be done
with the Crop tool, which is located
in the Tools palette in Photoshop.
Figure 13-1 shows the crop selection
in an image of a sidewalk artist. I crop
fairly closely (because in an image
like this, you want the total focus to
be on the subject). Using the Crop
tool without specifying a new print
size in Photoshop’s Options bar
pares down your image to make it
more appealing to you and your
viewer, improving the image’s com-
position. It also cuts down your file
size without compromising detail in
the image, although you might have to resize the image later to fit specific
print requirements.
Cropping an image is one of the most important aesthetic decisions you’ll
make when you edit in Photoshop or other image processing software.
Follow the same rules you would while shooting, such as the Rule of Thirds
and other composition rules presented in Chapter 1.
You can check the size of your image (both pixel dimensions and print 
dimensions/resolution) in Photoshop with the Image➪Image Size command.
When Photoshop crops your image, it becomes a smaller file. Figure 13-2
shows the file sizes before and after the crop.
Figure 13-1: A simple crop won’t damage the
detail in your image.

Figure 13-2: Find file sizes for a cropped image in the Image Size dialog box.
Making an Image Whole Again 
with Photomerge
You can take extra-tall things or extra-wide things
and string them together to make a panoramic 
picture with Photoshop’s Photomerge feature.
Although a landscape shot piece by piece and
stitched together in Photoshop has great appeal —
and that is what most people use Photomerge for —
you can do this same process on images of other
tall and thin subjects, too, such as buildings, trees,
sculptures . . . even clowns on stilts.
Using Photomerge to create one large, whole image
of something you could never fit into one camera
frame while shooting is easy. First, you need sev-
eral photos of something large, either horizontal or
vertical — a very tall tree, a landscape, or a building.
For this example, I use photos of a Tiki, which is a
very tall sculpture carved from a palm tree trunk.
(See Figure 13-3.)
Because of its thin width with respect to its height,
fitting it in one frame — even with a wide angle
lens — would at best give me a mediocre medium
shot of the Polynesian god. Instead, I snapped sev-
eral pictures of it (it’s an original, carved in the ’60s
261
Chapter 13: Combining and Manipulating Images
Figure 13-3: Merge multiple
photos into one.

262
Part III: Photoshop Art: Using Software to Enhance or Create Art Photos 
by a well-known Tiki carver) to create a clear image of the whole sculpture
that I can then print out at 10" x 42". (I have the option to double the merged
photo’s size — just like the sculpture itself — without much loss of fine detail
in the image.)
1. Open the photos that you want to stitch together into one large, whole
picture.
I create a folder for situations like this so that the photos are easily
accessible when I’m navigating Photoshop.
2. (Optional) Turn each picture to its side by opening each and choosing
Image➪Rotate Canvas➪90° CCW. (See Figure 13-4.)
If you’re merging a true landscape — that is, something horizontal —
you won’t have to do this step.
Because computer monitors are more wide than tall, I rotate the images
90 degrees counterclockwise because it’s easier to see them as one piece
horizontally rather than vertically.
Figure 13-4: Rotate composite images if needed.
You could rotate the individual images within the work area of
Photomerge. If you go that route, it would take you about the same
amount of time, or maybe longer, than doing it in Photoshop first.

Figure 13-5 shows the icons of my images as they appear after I turn
them on their sides. Now I’m ready to merge the photos that are in the
folder on my Desktop.
Figure 13-5: All my images are rotated.
3. In Photoshop CS, choose File➪Automate➪Photomerge.
4. In the Photomerge dialog box that appears (see Figure 13-6), click the
Browse button to navigate to the folder.
You can also navigate to files and open documents by selecting one from
the Use drop-down menu.
Figure 13-6: Browse for your files or folders here.
5. Browse to find the folder you’re merging.
6. Then click Open when the Open window appears onscreen.
263
Chapter 13: Combining and Manipulating Images

264
Part III: Photoshop Art: Using Software to Enhance or Create Art Photos 
The program lists the images that you have in your project folder.
7. Mark the Attempt to Automatically Arrange Source Images check box
so that Photoshop tries to connect your image using its automated
process.
If you don’t, Photomerge won’t try to put your images together.
Because Photomerge couldn’t put together my Tiki automatically, a
dialog box came up to let me know that. I then arranged the images
myself. In this case, I want the Tiki files that I rotate in Step 2.
You can add or remove files from the image you’re merging by changing
your folder selection to Files and browsing for the files you want. To
remove an image, simply select the file that appears in the list and click
the Remove button.
8. Click OK.
The program begins its merge. When the merge program finishes, it
either displays the merged files as it sees fit or asks you to click and
drag them from the top frame, where they are displayed, to the main
part of the window.
9. If prompted, click and drag the merged files to fit them together like
pieces of a seamless puzzle.
In the Tiki case, I got the prompt that said it couldn’t fit my images
together (probably because it sensed that it couldn’t get them to mesh).
I moved the images down to the main part of the window. They easily fit
together because the ends are transparent, and you can see where the
overlap is for each to fit them together. See Figure 13-7.
Figure 13-7: Time to flatten and rotate.
10. Flatten the image by choosing Layer➪Flatten Image.
Photomerge makes a layer for each part of the picture. That means each
picture is alone, within its own space, and the other images can be

moved on top of it. (Hence, that’s how you
can “see through the images.”) I discuss how
layers work and can be manipulated in
Chapter 14. Note: In Photomerge, you can’t
access your layers when the image is in the
working space.
11. (Optional) If you rotated your images in
Step 2, rotate the merged image clockwise
to stand it upright (vertically) by choosing
Image➪Rotate Canvas➪90° CW.
There! You have one whole picture of that
large thing you couldn’t fit into one frame
(whatever that one large thing is). In my
case, the Tiki is back together again, as tall
as ever (see Figure 13-8).
Here are some other tips to bear in mind when
merging:
 Minimize tweaks. Any time you transform
your image, you move pixels around. That
means that Photoshop has to interpolate,
which can result in a loss of fine detail in the
image. For more about interpolation and
resampling, see Chapter 16.
Transform your image very little. For example,
transform it only to fill in a small piece of the
frame that was left white or to even out an
image if it’s slightly cockeyed. If you overdo
it, your image will lose too much resolution.
 Make reparations. To repair a merged
photo, see Chapter 12 and do the same steps
as repairing an old photo.
 Tweak before you merge. If your images
vary a lot in hue and tone, you should tweak
them before using Photomerge. If at some
point in your Photomerge process, you see
that the images are off in this manner, go
back and work with your original images;
then run Photomerge again after you tweak
and resave the images in a folder.

Seamlessly Introducing Backgrounds 
in Photographs
Admit it — you’ve undoubtedly sometime taken a potentially great picture only
to have the subject surrounded by clutter. Maybe you weren’t careful enough
about image composition, or you just couldn’t help it that clutter runs through
the background. Sure, you could try to take the picture again or maybe move the
subject in front of a better background. When you can’t change life, however —
whether the disturbing culprit is a palm tree rising out from someone’s head
or an errant phone wire marring a crystal-blue sky behind a mid-century
motel sign — change it in Photoshop. To do that, create a new background.
The Tiki that I use as an example in the preceding section is an object that
doesn’t fill each frame evenly. After I finish merging an object like a Tiki,
I have to add a new cohesive background.
You can create simple backgrounds that match your picture by using the fol-
lowing technique:
1. In Photoshop, open an image to which you want to add a background.
I change the background to a brick red.
2. With the Eyedropper tool, click somewhere on the image.
This picks a color that is included within your photograph, which
is insurance that you’ll get a match to apply to your background.
See Chapter 1 for more about matching colors.
3. With the Paint Bucket tool, click the part of your picture’s background
that you want to change.
Pausing Photomerge
If the phone rings or you have to quickly scoot
to pick up your child at school, don’t click
Photomerge’s Cancel button if you have to leave
your computer because you’ll lose all the pre-
cious work you’ve done thus far. If you’ve got a
dozen images to connect and tweak (they don’t
always snap together), it could take some time
to piece them all together and to make sure
each is in the right place.
To come back to a project in progress, click the
Save Composition As button. This saves your work
area as a PGM file, which is a file format that lets
you click and drag all those pictures around in a
work area. To return to your project, just click the
Open Composition button (it toggles) and navi-
gate to the PGM file that you saved. When you
save this file, Photomerge saves all your images
in layers. For more about layers, see Chapter 14. 

This changes the part you clicked to whatever color you pick with the
Eyedropper tool. In my case, the background has been changed to brick
red, to match colors in the Tiki. (See Figure 13-9.)
Figure 13-9: Use the Eyedropper and Paint Bucket tools to try different backgrounds.
At this point, maybe you’re thinking about a couple of photographs to which
you’d like to add a matching color background, but those photographs aren’t
white. Well, it’s easy to make a background white.
To make a background white:
1. Select the object(s) for which you want the background changed by
using one (or more) of the selection tools (a marquee or lasso tool, or
the Magic Wand for a solid-color subject).
2. Choose Select➪Inverse.
Photoshop switches your selection from the objects that you select to
everything but the objects you select (the background).
3. After you check your selection and choose white for your background
color from the Tools palette, press Delete.
Press the D key on your keyboard to set the foreground color to black
and the background color to white.
267
Chapter 13: Combining and Manipulating Images

268
Part III: Photoshop Art: Using Software to Enhance or Create Art Photos 
You can get more natural-looking backgrounds by overlaying the Tiki onto
another picture with a clutter-free background. Read more about this in
Chapter 14.
Creating Art Photos through Symmetry
Another way to create unusual photography suitable to sell as art is to
manipulate images in Photoshop by taking part of an image and duplicating it
to create a symmetrical pattern. You can often find such opportunities to
create symmetry from architectural sources, such as the fretwork intricacies
of modern architecture, like the Eiffel Tower. Think of how a kaleidoscope
takes crystals and creates several mirror images of them, or how you used to
cut out valentines as a kid — half of a heart, from the folded side of a piece of
paper, that opened into a whole heart.
To create your own symmetrical art,
follow these steps:
1. In Photoshop, open a picture
of a shape or form that
approaches a pattern of 
symmetry — say, a building
or object.
To create something perfectly
symmetrical in photography is a
very difficult job — more fit for
a surveyor — so don’t worry if
it’s not perfect from one side to
the other.
For this example, I use the photo
shown in Figure 13-10. You can
use any photo for this art pro-
ject. The purpose is to create
sets of interesting lines — to play
with them and slide them around
with the Move tool — to make
your own quasi-symmetrical
masterpieces.
Figure 13-10: Start with a subject with
interesting lines.

2. Make a selection of one half of
the subject and its surrounding 
background.
Because you’re creating your
own pattern using the existing
symmetry, you need only part
of the photo. See Figure 13-11. I
eyed the bike and the reflection
of the water to where I thought
would be a nice place to make a
break for cropping.
3. Choose Edit➪Copy.
4. Choose Edit➪Paste.
5. Choose Edit➪Transform➪
Flip Horizontal.
6. Select the Move tool in the
Toolbox (or press the V key on
the keyboard) and reposition
the upper layer.
Try to align the center edges.
7. Use the Edit➪Transform com-
mands as necessary.
You might need to rotate or skew the upper layer a bit to get proper
alignment at the point where the two halves meet.
8. Flatten the image by choosing Layer➪Flatten Image.
Flattening the layers of an image reduces the file size. For more about
layers, see Chapter 14.
9. Crop your new image as you see fit and then save it.
Cropping provides additional balance and cuts out the parts of the
images that don’t appear symmetrical.
My final image is shown in Figure 13-12.

Using Layers to Create a Theme
In This Chapter
 Seeing how layers work
 Making a layered picture with a theme
L
ayering images is one of the most powerful features of Photoshop.
Remember working with an x-y axis in algebra? You can think of your
image in terms of that plane. In more advanced math, you also have a z axis,
which is a kind of space that moves up and down. You can think of other
images that you lay over your original as being in that plane. A layer is just
a picture file that Photoshop uses to make an image. Photoshop can merge
many pictures together in a kind-of-third dimension called a layer.
For the purposes of this book, I leave heavy rendering of dozens of images to
graphic designers. From a photographer’s perspective (more specifically,
this art photographer), if a photographic image is overdone with
Photoshop, you move it into a different category of art —
more toward graphics. For now, digital photography
graphic designs have not sold widely as prints without
the aid of mass production. In other words, designs do
sell but mostly if they’re part of a poster produced as
part of an event, a gallery opening, movie premiere,
or stage production. But, in the art world, you never
know when this will catch on.
This chapter discusses how you can make interest-
ing photo montages using Photoshop layers.
Using Layers in Photoshop
When working with layers in Photoshop, first show the appropri-
ate palette. The Layers palette can be shown and hidden, like all of

272
Part III: Photoshop Art: Using Software to Enhance or Create Art Photos 
Photoshop’s palettes, through the
Window menu (Window➪Layers).
See Figure 14-1.
You can layer any image one on top
of the other by selecting a smaller
image and dragging it onto a larger
image. In the first example of layer-
ing a bit later in this chapter, I take
a simple image — a cutout of an
orange — and juxtapose it with an
image of a natural window of stone.
It’s important to know the relative
pixel dimensions of images you’re
combining. Use the Photoshop
Image➪Image Size command to
check (and change) pixel dimensions
so that you get the desired relative
size of each element in your artwork.
Feathering
Before I get into the fun of layering
images, you need to understand the
concept of feathering. This finishing
technique is essential to help your superimposed images blend smoothly,
preventing an upper layer from looking as if it’s been pasted on top of your
background (like a poster board project kids make in grade school).
To make the superimposed image blend in — and avoid a pasted-on 
hard outlined edge — feather a selection (choose Select➪Feather)
before copying.
Figure 14-2 shows you what happens when you select and feather and then
click and drag a selection from one document to another (in this example, a
plain white document).
The two basic ways to soften the edges of a selection with feathering are
 Make a selection and then feather. Use any of Photoshop’s selection
tools or commands to make a selection. Then use the menu command
Select➪Feather to feather the selection.
 Set the feathering before making the selection. Both the Marquee and
Lasso selection tools offer a Feather field in the Options bar. Enter a
value in the field before using the tool to make a selection.
Figure 14-1: The Layers palette.

Figure 14-2: Note the effects that different values of feathering have on an image.
Creating a simple two-layer project
Here’s how you can move one image over another in Photoshop to get an awe-
inspiring result for your viewers. I start with a simple two-image example:
1. In Photoshop, open the two photos that you want to arrange together,
one on top of the other.
273
Chapter 14: Using Layers to Create a Theme

274
Part III: Photoshop Art: Using Software to Enhance or Create Art Photos 
Here are the photos I use: an orange and part of an edifice of an Inca ruin
that I call a natural window, as shown in Figure 14-3.
Figure 14-3: Setting a piece of fruit among ruins creates an artful still life.
2. Make a selection of the area of one image that you want to copy to the
other.
For a subject that’s similar in color to its background but has a distinct
edge (like the orange used in this example), the Lasso tool is a good
choice. When there’s a significant difference in color between the subject
and the background, the Magic Wand tool or the Magnetic Lasso tool
(both found in the Toolbox) might make selecting easier.
You can set your feathering before using a selection tool, or you can
feather afterward by using the Select➪Feather command. Generally,
when you’re selecting a subject with distinct edges to copy/paste into
another image, a feathering value of 2 pixels is sufficient.
3. Refine your selection.
As you can see to the left in Figure 14-4, you might need to fine-tune the
edges of your selection. Hold down the Shift key and drag a selection
tool to add to a selection; hold down the Option key (Mac) or the Alt key
(Windows) and drag a selection tool to subtract pixels from a selection.
4. Move your selected subject to the other image.
You have a couple of choices when you’re duplicating the selected pixels
into the second image:
• Copy and paste: You can use the menu command Edit➪Copy, switch
to the other image, and then use the command Edit➪Paste.
• Click and drag: You can also simply select the Move tool in the
Toolbox, click the selected pixels, and then drag the selection to
the window of the other image.

Figure 14-4: Select process makes or breaks a quality layering project.
5. Position and transform as necessary.
Use the Move tool to position the pasted pixels where you need them in
the second image. You can also use Photoshop’s Edit➪Transform com-
mand to scale, rotate, skew, or otherwise fine-tune the appearance of the
pasted pixels in the second image. Because Photoshop pastes onto
a separate layer, you can use these commands without fear of making
changes to the original background layer.
When using a Transform command, you’ll see a bounding box surrounding
the pixels on the layer. Drag the side or corner anchor points (the hollow
boxes around the square, shown in Figure 14-5) to manipulate the pixels.
Figure 14-5: Drag anchor points to change the size and shape of the bounding box.
6. Evaluate the composite for lighting and shadows.
After you move and transform the pasted pixels, take a good look at the
composited image and ask yourself these questions:
275
Chapter 14: Using Layers to Create a Theme

276
Part III: Photoshop Art: Using Software to Enhance or Create Art Photos 
• Do the angles of lighting for the background and the subject match?
• Are there any places where a shadow should be falling on the new
subject that no shadow is evident?
• Is the overall tonality of the composited image harmonious, or do
you need to adjust the lightness/darkness of the new subject?
• Is there agreement in overall color between the new subject and
the background?
As you can see in Figure 14-6, sometimes additional work with Photoshop’s
Image➪Adjustment command is in order to completely unify the new sub-
ject with the original background. (See Chapter 12 for more information
on using Photoshop’s Curves, Shadow/Highlight, and other adjustment
commands, as well as the Dodge and Burn tools for localized adjustments.)
Figure 14-6: Adjust color and tonality of the new subject to match the 
background.

There’s generally no need to flatten the layers in your image (unless you’re
desperate to save hard drive space or require a specific file format that doesn’t
support layers). Save your images as a Photoshop PSD file without using the
Image➪Flatten Layers command so that you have maximum flexibility to
make changes or adjustments to the image.
Creating a More Complex Layer Project
Creating collages around a theme is popular in many art venues, from huge
billboards in upscale shopping areas to advertising to small personal scrap-
books. A good theme leads to a good collage. When you keep to a specific
theme — one that you’ve narrowed down to a simple focus — a viewer can
easily understand your overarching message. For example, when creating a
Roman collage theme, consider using appropriate elements such as round,
arched, or fluted columns; marble/bronze trims and mosaic tile; decorative
sculptures; and frescos from your photographs. The only limits to creating a
theme are your imagination and source photos.
Here, I show you how to use Photoshop to put together a group of pictures —
a collage — with multiple layers.
In a nutshell, you take a background, middle ground, and foreground and 
separate each with a solid color fill layer, which is then faded to become
semitransparent. Each time you move a picture, Photoshop automatically
creates a new layer for you. 
Using Photoshop’s Browse command (File➪Browse), you can view your
images while you navigate to them in different parts of your computer.
In Photoshop CS2, Bridge (a separate program) automatically opens when
you browse. You can open your collage images from Bridge; keep them open
(and docked) so that you can toggle back and forth among them.
277
Chapter 14: Using Layers to Create a Theme
Saving as an investment
Sometimes you invest a considerable amount of
time in making a selection or need to interrupt
your selection creation for any number of reasons.
Rather than risk losing your work to date, choose
Select➪Save Selection. This command creates
an alpha channelin Photoshop’s Channels palette,
which is actually your selection. Later, you can
choose Select➪Load Selection to convert that
alpha channel back into a selection. If you find
it necessary to later delete the alpha channel
(because the selection has been refined and
resaved with another name or the Channels
palette is getting crowded), simply drag it to the
Trash icon at the bottom of the Channels palette.

278
Part III: Photoshop Art: Using Software to Enhance or Create Art Photos 
1. Set up your background image.
a. Open (double-click it from your browser window) a picture that you
want to be the background of your document.
b. Choose Image➪Image Size to set your image size.
I set mine to 8 x 10.
c. Check all three options at the bottom of the Image Size box.
I changed the width to 10, the height to 8, and the resolution to
300 pixels per inch (ppi), which is a resolution that’s great for
most inkjet printers because it balances image quality and file size.
Experiment a little. Try different images until you get a background that
you feel summarizes your theme. I chose an image of wooden marimbas,
cropped so that they form a nice set of horizontal and vertical lines
(kind of like railroad tracks) that also have perspective. The image is
shown in Figure 14-7.
Figure 14-7: Background image for a music theme.
2. (Optional) Use the Channel Mixer layer (Layer➪New Adjustment Layer➪
Channel Mixer) to convert your background to B&W — the first step
to give it a sepia tone.

I wanted a fairly bleached-out background (that is, lots of pure white
tones) so that the middle ground and foreground images aren’t over-
shadowed by the background picture. Figure 14-8 shows the channel
mixer values I used. I selected the Monochrome check box and tweak
the slider bars to give lots of white tones. (For more about using the
Channel Mixer layer, see Chapter 9.)
Figure 14-8: Convert your background layer to B&W.
3. (Optional) Use a color balance
layer (Layer➪New Adjustment
Layer➪Color Balance) to make
a sepia tone.
You can choose any tone that
you feel matches your images.
Figure 14-9 shows the slider
bars in the Color Balance dialog
box. You can choose values for
not only the midtones but also
for highlights and shadows.
I chose a brown (sepia) tone to match the colors of natural wood instru-
ments. To maintain a harsh contrast, I left the Preserve Luminosity
check box unchecked. I needed this contrast because this layer will be 
covered with three fill layers later. I also chose to get my sepia tones by
balancing only the midtones. I didn’t use the Tone Balance options for
the shadows or highlights. For more about creating an art photo by
choosing from a variety of sepia tones, see Chapter 12.

Part III: Photoshop Art: Using Software to Enhance or Create Art Photos 
4. To choose a color overlay for
the background, choose Layer➪
New Fill Layer➪Solid Color and
choose a faint color to soften
the background.
Click the color swatch to open
the Color Picker. I chose a pale
yellow (see Figure 14-10) from the
Color Picker dialog box. To get
the pale yellow, click in the ver-
tical color spectrum bar of color
choices to get in the vicinity of
yellows, as shown in the Pick a
Solid Color square work area.
5. Use the Opacity slider in the
Layers palette to control how
much you blend this color into
the background picture.
To soften your background,
click Layer 1 in the Layers
palette (Windows➪Layer) and
then reduce the opacity to 70%,
as shown in Figure 14-11.
Making a semitransparent over-
lay for your layers with pictures
in them softens the subjects
contained in the pictures.
Reducing the opacity lets you
blend two layers together so that you get, in essence, both pictures
together. If you use a white fill layer, reducing the opacity gives a silky
smooth look to the image you lay it over.
6. Open another image and select an object to move to your collage.
I selected my object to add (a street musician) with the Magnetic Lasso tool.
7. Soften the edges of your selection with Select➪Feather.
For most subjects with defined edges, feathering one or two pixels is
great. However, if you want very soft edges to more gradually blend your
subject into the background, use a larger value.
8. Copy and arrange your selection.
Use the Copy and Paste commands (as described earlier in this chapter)
or drag the selection with the Move tool onto the window of your collage
background. If necessary, use the Edit➪Transform command to scale,
rotate, and otherwise manipulate the pasted pixels.
9. (Optional) Using the Add a Layer Style button (the second one over on
the bottom of the Layers palette drop-down menu), I put a color over-
lay to soften the image of the man just a little.
Figure 14-10: Make a new fill layer
semitransparent to soften the background.
Figure 14-11: Reduce opacity to soften the
background.

I clicked the Add a Layer Style button at the bottom of the Layers palette
and selected Color Overlay to bring up the Layer Style dialog box. I then
chose a color via the Color Picker and used the slider bar there to adjust
the opacity. 
10. Repeat Steps 4–8 for the additional images to move and make overlays
for. You can tweak them along the way so that they fit as secondary
and complementary — not primary — images in the collage.
For example, in Figure 14-12, I made a selection to apply a Brightness/
Contrast adjustment to lighten the image (of children playing instruments).
When copied into my collage, this image was less prominent and therefore
didn’t conflict with what became the primary image of the collage. I added
just one more image after this one (the guy walking away with the horn).
Figure 14-12: Secondary images get less detail than primary ones do.
11. (Optional) Repeat Step 4 one more time, using white as a fill layer.
This unified my entire image with a softness — a subtle retreat from
what a photograph taken with a normal lens would ordinarily give.
12. Use a layer mask (Layer➪Layer Mask➪Reveal All) to clean up your image.
Click a layer in the Layers palette and then add the layer mask. Paint with
the Brush tool, using black as the foreground color, to hide areas along the
edges. Repeat for each additional layer that needs touching up, clicking
the layer in the Layers palette and then adding a layer mask for that layer.
For example, I noticed some black edges on the man playing the instrument.
To soften them, I chose Layer 2 (where the man appears) and then chose
Layer➪Layer Mask➪Reveal All. When I painted with black on the layer mask,
my brush acted as an eraser, hiding that part of the layer. See Figure 14-13.

Figure 14-13: You can brush up your image using a layer mask. 
13. Flatten the image (if desired), and you’re done!
Remember that flattening the image blends all the layers into one layer,
which reduces the file size but makes it nearly impossible to go back
and make changes to your collage. Figure 14-14 shows my final result.

Special Effects
In This Chapter
 Using Photoshop filters to enhance your art photos
 Advanced Photoshop special effects
 Creating backgrounds in Photoshop
P
hotoshop has literally hundreds of effects that you can use to manipu-
late an image. The choices available range from subtle to dramatic to
(in my opinion) downright bizarre and surreal. How far you want to take your
art photography from its original state is a matter of your taste and the out-
come you desire.
For making saleable images that are superior prints, keep in
mind the printing process as you move through your edit-
ing process. And with the special effects you can achieve
with the special effect filters Photoshop offers, you can
take a great photograph and tweak or twist it into
something spectacular.
Experimenting with an image in Photoshop is a trial-
and-error process; you won’t really know the potential
of the final result until you print the image (discussed
in Chapter 17). However, you can twist and turn and
tweak an image in Photoshop with a minimum amount
of processing. In this chapter, I discuss using filters, cre-
ating a new background, and applying color enhancement.
Pick your finest images to tweak in Photoshop. Otherwise, you
run the risk that your image won’t have clear lines, shapes, and forms.
Too, you’re likely to get more image degradation when you run it through the
various filters and options. Alternatively, if you have an image that you think
is beyond salvage, you might just turn it into a gem with Photoshop’s more
powerful filters.

284
Part III: Photoshop Art: Using Software to Enhance or Create Art Photos 
Photoshop Filter Effects
Filters in Photoshop work differently than those that you attach to your
camera’s lens (see Chapter 11). With so many choices, menu bars, values,
colors, and patterns to choose from, you might wonder why you even need
a camera at all! As a photographer, though, I’m sure you want to work with
your own images, because in Photoshop, starting with your own exposures
can let you create many effects from the same shot.
For example, Figure 15-1 shows
before and after pictures of the
Photoshop Watercolor filter applied
to an architectural landscape in
my attempt to bring the golden
age of British watercolors back to
life. Joseph Mallord William Turner,
a British watercolorist, used the
same hues as this tweaked land-
scape during his lifetime evolution
from realism to abstraction. To see
how to tweak an image like this,
see the upcoming section,
“Watercolor filter.” 
Most of Photoshop’s filters are
destructive; that is, they make per-
manent changes to the image.
(Adjustment layers, on the other
hand, are considered nondestructive
because deleting the adjustment
layer returns you to the original
unchanged image.) Always make a
copy of your image file before you
start making permanent changes to it. You can make the copy in the Mac
Finder or Windows Explorer, or you can use Photoshop’s Image➪Duplicate
command.
Photoshop has too many filters for me to cite and show the effects of each
here. The ones I concentrate on in this chapter are Gaussian Blur, Unsharp
Mask, Plastic Wrap, Glowing Edges, Watercolor, Charcoal, Chalk & Charcoal,
Graphic Pen, and Emboss. For more detail on these filters, see Photoshop CS
Timesaving Techniques For Dummies (Phyllis Davis) and Photoshop CS2 
All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies (Barbara Obermeier), both published
by Wiley.
Figure 15-1: Use Photoshop’s filters to transform
your shots.

When you apply some of the special effects of image processing programs,
sometimes your image appears to have lost detail. Truth be told, some effects
look no better than unwanted noise in your digital image. But then again, you
might just craft an artistic view that is creative and compelling. Be very selec-
tive when using any filter in any image processing program because some 
filters work better than others. Some are meant to give your picture only a
slight edge over the original.
Mies van der Rohe is a famous architectural designer who penned, “Less is
more.” This truism applies to when you process your images. Using one or
two objects/subjects is best as well as using a uniform background. For more
on creating flattering backgrounds, see the section, “Making a Background for
Your Images.”
Gaussian Blur filter
William Klein’s famous photograph of a child, Candy Store, Amsterdam Avenue,
New York (1954), was shot with effective blur. This blur effect left some critics
referring to his work as photography that didn’t meet standards of quality.
Check out Klein’s photo at
www.masters-of-photography.com/K/klein/klein_candy_store_full.html
You can create a similar kind of blur via Photoshop’s Gaussian Blur filter
(Filter➪Blur➪Gaussian Blur). A good image to work with using this filter
is one of a child. With this filter, you can take hard edges or contrast and
mellow them both in the foreground and background. In Figure 15-2, sharp
rocks transform to pillows to float upon, and humans turn into dreams.
Figure 15-2: Use the Gaussian Blur filter for a dreamlike setting.
285
Chapter 15: Using Photoshop for Special Effects

286
Part III: Photoshop Art: Using Software to Enhance or Create Art Photos 
To create the effect in Figure 15-2, see
in Figure 15-3 the settings that I used.
The Radius setting of 4.5 pixels is a
good blur value whereby the image
has enough contrast to be clear and
enough blur to make it soft.
You can also use the Gaussian Blur
filter to create intentional softening
or blur in the background of your
image. The Gaussian Blur filter is
an absolute must if you want to 
produce a killer sky. Use this filter
to take a mediocre sky and make it
surreal.
The Gaussian Blur filter can also 
produce a special other-planetlike
special effect:
1. Take an image in which you have a good bit of background sky and
clouds.
2. Select the sky with the Magic Wand tool, using a tolerance setting
(located in the top menu bar) of about 20 or 30.
To make continuous multiple selections, hold down the Shift key while
selecting. For more about selection techniques, see Chapter 13.
After your initial tap on your background with the Magic Wand tool, you
can choose Select➪Similar, which picks up most of the rest of the sky.
This also works especially well with clouds. Pick one cloud with your
selection tool and then choose Select➪Similar to have all your clouds
selected. Come to think of it, this technique also works with flowers and
all kinds of objects that repeat themselves in tone and contrast.
3. Choose Filter➪Blur➪Gaussian Blur.
The blur becomes more pronounced as you click and drag the slider
(in the Gaussian Blur dialog box) to the right. My before and after images
are shown in Figure 15-4.
Unsharp Mask filter
The Unsharp Mask filter (Filter➪Sharpen➪Unsharp Mask) adjusts the contrast
at the edges of objects in your image. When you open an image and select this
option, Photoshop calculates an amount, radius, and threshold. When you
tweak to make your edges more crisp, you usually move the Amount and
Radius sliders a little to the right and the Threshold slider a little to the left.
Figure 15-3: Adjust Gaussian Blur settings here.

Figure 15-4: Make surreal backgrounds surreal with the Gaussian Blur filter.
Figure 15-5 shows how I took a shot of a box of dice and tweaked the image
using Unsharp Mask to the max for a special effect that looks almost hand-
drawn. The animated look of the picture using this drastic tweak can come in
handy when you’re building a layered cartoon image.
Figure 15-5: Tweak a shot with the Unsharp Mask filter.
287
Chapter 15: Using Photoshop for Special Effects

288
Part III: Photoshop Art: Using Software to Enhance or Create Art Photos 
For a special effect such as this, you can move the Amount and Radius sliders
to their max values of 500% at 250 pixels at a Threshold of 0. The Unsharp
Mask dialog box shows your image as you tweak the values.
Plastic Wrap filter
Sure, using Unsharp Mask is cool, but take it further. Building on the image
in the preceding section, read on to see how you can continue to manipulate
this same image in even more dramatic ways. Here I move on to the Plastic
Wrap filter. Using this filter makes an
image look as if you’ve wrapped your
subjects tightly with, um, plastic
wrap. Go figure. You can imagine what
that looks like. But here, tweaking
this image with the Plastic Wrap filter
(an image that has been altered using
maximum settings of the Unsharp
Mask filter), you get a Surrealist effect.
After using the maximum Unsharp
Mask settings, you can use the set-
tings shown for the Plastic Wrap
filter in Figure 15-6.
Glowing Edges filter
Applying the Glowing Edges filter
(Stylize➪Glowing Edges) makes an
image’s edges range from being subtly
outlined with color to radiantly glow-
ing, like neon at night. You tweak an
edge’s width, brightness, and smooth-
ness (as shown in Figure 15-7) to get
the effect you want.
Watercolor filter
The Watercolor filter application is easy and requires only that you choose
Filter➪Artistic➪Watercolor and then adjust the sliders so that the effect is to
your liking. Check out the amazing transformation in the before and after
floral image of Figure 15-8. (I used settings of Brush Detail: 10, Shadow
Intensity: 1, and Texture: 2.)
Sometimes lightening your image by using the sliders in Shadow/Highlight
(Image➪Adjustments➪Shadow/Highlight) and/or tweaking the Hue/Saturation
option in Photoshop before using the Watercolor filter gives you a better result
than using the filter alone.
Figure 15-6: Go surreal with the Plastic Wrap
filter.
Figure 15-7: Tweak the glow on edges here.

Figure 15-8: Try different values to create a watercolor effect.
Sketch filters
If watercolors aren’t your thing, take an image and convert it to a sketchlike
image in Photoshop by using one of the sketch filters. I find this technique
effective when starting with an image with lots of shadows, silhouettes from
natural sunlight, and lines within architecture. Here are but a few of the Sketch
filters that Photoshop offers.
Charcoal
Use the Charcoal filter (Filter➪Sketch➪Charcoal) to create streaked lines,
just like you get when drawing with a charcoal pencil. Photoshop posterizes
major edges with bold edges, turning darker shadows into highlights. Start
with a heavily shadowed image, apply the Charcoal filter, and then lighten.
See the results in Figure 15-9.
I chose the maximum Detail setting (as well as Charcoal Thickness: 5 and
Light/Dark Balance: 37) because I had many dark tones in my original image
that, when highlighted, still showed some detail through sketched lines in
between the edges.
Figure 15-9: Use the Charcoal filter for a soft, hand-drawn effect.
289
Chapter 15: Using Photoshop for Special Effects

290
Part III: Photoshop Art: Using Software to Enhance or Create Art Photos 
Chalk & Charcoal
Use the Chalk & Charcoal filter (Filter➪Sketch➪Chalk & Charcoal) on images
that have a good range of highlights, midtones, and shadows. This effect
makes midtones mostly gray and chalky, and shadows turn to black charcoal
lines. If your image consists only of a limited range of midtones, using the
Chalk & Charcoal filter makes these colors flat and gray.
In the picture I chose, one with a darker foreground and lighter background,
the lighter tones in back appeared hand-brushed with short diagonal strokes.
As a result, in the foreground, the dark tones are medium to dark shades of
gray, and the light that breaks through has a soft chalky appearance, as shown
in Figure 15-10. Setting Charcoal Area and Chalk Area to 6 and Stroke Pressure
to 1 produced this effect.
Figure 15-10: Create an effect of drawing with chalk and charcoal.

Graphic Pen
Use the Graphic Pen filter (Filter➪Sketch➪Graphic Pen) to give your image
the feeling that your image was sketched in pen and ink. Figure 15-11 shows
how an image can change from a clear photograph to one that was sketched
fastidiously. You get more options in the directions of the strokes with this
tool than with other sketch tools. In so doing, you can change the depth of
detail depending on what direction the strokes go.
Figure 15-11: Go for the old movies “still” look in this transformation from photo to sketch.
I set the Stroke Direction to Horizontal, emphasizing the foreground and sep-
arating it from the fairly mundane background. I stuck to the middle ground
(a setting of 10) on the Stroke Length and Light/Dark Balance (59).
Emboss filter
Use the Emboss filter (Filter➪Stylize➪Emboss) to stylize your image with a
sculpted look, as shown in Figure 15-12. The Emboss filter is tricky in that at
low values, it offers you a gray, claylike cover to your image — and at higher
values, the claylike gray separates from your image’s real color so that you’ve
got double vision (not ordinary seeing double) in which you see your subject
in color and a copy of your subject in a kind of claymation. 
Figure 15-12: This filter makes an image look like pressed tin.
291
Chapter 15: Using Photoshop for Special Effects

292
Part III: Photoshop Art: Using Software to Enhance or Create Art Photos 
In this case I went for the conservative look of this filter with height values of
9 pixels — any more, and the shadows drift off onto entities by themselves.
I tweaked the Angle to 49° because that gave me the most detail in the bikes
and people. It also added a little dimension, which is the real deal with this filter.
The Amount slider was set to 129% for this image.
Constructing a Composite à la Warhol 
Using Photoshop Filters
Time to turn up the flame a few notches. Take a very simple image — like an
uncluttered basic portrait — and
multiply it into a frenzy of color vari-
ations and repetition to emulate the
work of Andy Warhol, an icon of pop
art, who created startling and revolu-
tionary block prints of repeating
images. Here’s how you can emulate
his work via Photoshop from one
simple image of your own.
1. Open a color shoulders-up por-
trait (a head shot) and then use
the Crop tool from the Tools
palette to crop the image so
it’s a tight fit in the frame.
Start with a copy of your origi-
nal so you still have your source
image.
I used Figure 15-13 to begin the
process.
2. (Optional) Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Desaturate to take the color
out of the image.
Desaturating an image is a simple way to change it to look as if it is black-
and-white (B&W), clearing the
way of all color so that the gray
tones can be replaced with the
bright, offbeat colors from the
Gradient Map.
3. Choose Image➪Adjustments➪
Gradient Map.
I clicked the sample gradient in
the Gradient Map dialog box and
chose the Rainbow gradient, as
shown in Figure 15-14. I also
Figure 15-13: Start with a simple portrait to
make a Warhol block print
Figure 15-14: Click the drop-down menu to get
gradients with colors.

selected the Reverse option
because I liked the sharpness of
the models features with this
option.
Figure 15-15 shows what the
Gradient Map tool does to
your desaturated image.
4. Save your base image.
You can use this alone (um, stop
here) or with other portraits
produced in the same way to
make a composite of like images
(keep reading).
To make it easier to find when
you repeat the image in different
color tones, save it in its own
specially named folder on your
desktop. And if you make a mis-
take, you can start over again
with this image.
5. Choose Image➪Duplicate➪ImageName as many times as you want
the image repeated (where ImageName is the name of your origi-
nal file).
6. Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Hue/Saturation.
7. Enter 20 for the hue for a picture that appears active on your screen
(any picture).
8. Click OK and save to your project folder.
9. Repeat Steps 6, 7, and 8, adding 20 to the hue value each time.
My composite contained nine images, so I did this eight times. (I renamed
my original and tweaked that one last.) At the end of this, you have nine
images open on your desktop. Each time you change the hue by 20,
your image takes on a different gradient color. Continue to add 20 to
the hue for each picture to reach the max hue (which is 180) after the
ninth picture.
See Figure 15-16 to see the Hue/Saturation feature and the files 
duplicated.
10. Choose File➪Automate➪Picture Package.

Gradient Map tool.

Figure 15-16: Up the hue for each image in the composite.
11. Select the page size from
the Layout drop-down list
(Document section), choose
the nine-picture option —
(9)2.55x3.25 — as shown in
Figure 15-17.
12. Click the first box (in the
upper-right corner of the
layout) and then navigate
to your first picture.
13. Repeat Step 12 for the rest of
the pictures, selecting a new
picture for each box.
14. Click OK and wait a few sec-
onds for Photoshop to make your block print.
15. After the block print is compiled, choose Layer➪Flatten Layers to
make all the prints in one layer.
See Chapter 14 for more information about layers.
Figure 15-18 shows the final result.

Part III: Photoshop Art: Using Software to Enhance or Create Art Photos 
Making a Background for Your Images
Adding a different or dramatic background to an image can provide you with
a whole new look and feel for an image. For example, using a fiery background
could add spice to a shot of a supermodel or conjure up feelings of a native
ritual when placed behind shots of South Seas’ island Tikis. Let Photoshop
do the work of cleaning up a less-than-optimal background and insert some-
thing artsy.
Here’s how to make a fiery background:
1. Open up a new Photoshop document.
2. Make the image 10 x 8 and the Resolution 300 pixels/inch.
3. Press the D key on your keyboard to set the default colors of black
(foreground) and white (background).
4. Choose Filter➪Render➪Clouds to get a premade version of a
Photoshop cloud image.
5. Choose Filter➪Render➪Lighting Effects.
Use this option to spread light among the clouds with a half-dozen slider
bars, as shown in Figure 15-19.
At the top of the Lighting Effects dialog box is a drop-down menu that
offers preset slider values for the sliders for the rest of the dialog box
along with varying cloud type patterns. In addition, in the Preview
window, you can click and drag shapes that Photoshop automatically
inserts to redistribute the preselected light values.
Figure 15-19: Use these sliders to make fiery clouds.

6. In the Lighting Effects dialog box, do the following:
a. Choose Omni for the type of light (Light Type) to change the light dis-
tribution from the default ellipse to a circular pattern.
b. Click the white color swatch to the right of the Intensity slider to open
the Color Picker.
c. From the Color Picker, choose a red-orange color for your fiery 
background.
The cloud renders orange with black.
d. Drag the Intensity slider to 50.
Don’t worry about the focus here.
e. Under Properties, click the white color swatch next to the Material

P
aper files occupy space in a file cabinet, and digital files occupy space on
a hard drive. Making sure the files don’t burst out of their seams means
keeping track of how big they are because file size is the very foundation upon
which your computer will operate — lots of big files make a computer move
like molasses. And keeping track of the space you’re working in is largely
dependent on your file sizes.
In this chapter, many of the common file types are defined in
terms of their size with respect to keeping the image intact —
that is, not losing detail in the image as you manipulate
and process it along the way to printing.
Files become big in a variety of ways. It happens when
you’re not even thinking about it. Adding a layer,
using a template, and moving documents from Word
to Photoshop all require space in your computer
and all make your files bigger.
After you get rolling in digital photography, you’ll need
more space to keep the large picture files. You can get
a 160 gigabyte (GB) external hard drive from LaCie for
about $100. It connects through your computer’s FireWire
port. FireWire is an extra-fast connection that will have your
files moving from your computer to your external hard drive and
back at lightning speed. See Chapter 3 for more about external hard drives.
For decent quality when printing to an inkjet printer, you want an image reso-
lution of 300 pixels per inch (ppi) so that it retains quality. See Chapter 2 for
more about what pixels are and how they make up your image.

Part IV: The Final Output: Gallery-Worthy Prints 
Transferring an Image from Your 
Camera to Your Computer
Unless you print directly from a digital camera or the camera’s media, digital
images from your camera are stored on your computer.
Of course, an image can get into your computer from a variety of other sources,
such as a scanner or the Internet. Downloading brings these image files onto
your computer. iPhoto, by default on Macintosh computers, opens automati-
cally when you connect the USB cable from your camera to your computer
and turn on your camera. The program asks whether you want to download
your images from the camera. Most other camera software that imports pic-
tures from your camera, on both Windows and the Mac, does the same.
To work with each image in preparation for printing, you need an image editing
program. Most digital cameras come with some sort of rudimentary software,
but the program of choice is Photoshop (for professionals) or Photoshop
Elements (for those with smaller budgets and/or less demanding requirements).
Photoshop CS2 is the latest version and now includes Adobe Bridge, which
can be used to browse and organize your image files.
From film/scanning
To bring into your computer a hard copy, film-based source image — whether
a negative or a positive — you need to scan the image to create a digital copy.
Although a dedicated film scanner is the tool of choice, purchasing a scanner
that can scan both transparencies and reflective materials (such as photos and
paper) lets you cover more bases for fewer dollars. See Chapter 3 for more
about scanners.
If you’re scanning print material and get lots of little dot overlays along with
your scan, you can get rid of these in Photoshop by running your scanned
material through the Gaussian Blur filter (Filter➪Blur➪Gaussian Blur). For
more about Photoshop filters, see Chapter 15.
From a JPEG file
Almost all digital cameras can use JPEG files to record images, and some use
only the JPEG file format. The camera holds these files on internal memory
or on removable media that you slip inside them (see Chapter 3). You then
download these stored images from your camera or removable media to
your computer. Many cameras store your images in the Pictures folder of
your computer, giving them various and sundry (and sometime long and
boring) numbers.

Few professional photographers use the software that comes with their 
computer or camera to download and organize their images. You, too, can
find better — and affordable — software, such as iView MediaPro (www.
iview-multimedia.com) and Extensis Portfolio (www.extensis.com/en/
products/asset_management.jsp).
The JPEG file format uses compression to reduce file size, enabling you to
store more photos on your camera’s removable media than if you used the
TIFF or Raw file formats. Although this is great when you’re in the field, keep
in mind that the process of saving in the JPEG format actual discards some of
the image data. Repeatedly resaving as JPEG can severely degrade an image’s
appearance. Therefore, after opening a JPEG file in your image editing pro-
gram and making changes, I suggest that you use the program’s File➪Save As
command and create a TIFF file (which won’t discard image data) rather than
using the Save command to overwrite the JPEG. Don’t worry, though, about
opening/viewing/closing a JPEG — it’s only the saving that can degrade the
image.
From a Raw file
A Raw file consists of the unprocessed image data and information about that
image data and the file, called metadata. (Raw means nothing less than what
it says — no acronym here.) The metadata can include such information about
the image as the shutter speed and f-stop, the white balance, the camera and
lens used, and even (for some cameras) the actual spot at which the image was
captured in the form of Global Positioning System (GPS) data. In addition, the
metadata can include information about the image’s file, such as the date/time
the file was created, the file’s size, and the filename.
When you make changes to a Raw file’s appearance using Photoshop’s Camera
Raw plug-in (see Figure 16-1), the image itself is not changed. Instead, all the
settings you select in Camera Raw are recorded to the metadata, where they
can be accessed at any time. And because the adjustments are recorded to
the metadata rather than actually made to the image itself, the original image
is always available — unchanged and untouched. All you need to do is reopen
the file in Camera Raw and apply different adjustments. Therein lies the beauty
of working with Raw images — no matter how many versions you create and
no matter how many changes you apply, the original, unprocessed image data
always remains but a click away!
Photoshop CS2 has a really swift way of displaying the Raw file dialog box. It
uses your camera’s metadata to list (along the top part of the dialog box) the
vital stats of your shot — camera type, Raw file type (each digital camera has
a different Raw file type; CR2 is the type of file that Canon Rebel XT shoots in),
ISO value, shutter speed, f-stop, and focal length. Notice the information at
the top in Figure 16-1.

Figure 16-1: The Raw dialog box in Photoshop CS2.
Raw is an extremely valuable format for professionals; as soon as word gets
out how nice this format is to tweak on your computer, everyone will join in
on the fun. Several aspects of the image capture can wait until you download
your photo onto your computer instead of getting bogged down to get the
perfect shot in the field. Raw files are large; in the digital darkroom, the Raw
conversion on multiple files can take some time. Because Raw files give more
detail in terms of light and color, they are preferred among professionals to
use during the editing process.
Using Raw files with Tiger and Panther
In Mac OS X Tiger and Panther (v 10.4 and 10.3,
respectively), you don’t need to download soft-
ware for your digital camera. The Mac OS has its
own utility called Image Capture (Applications➪
Image Capture in Tiger). Connect your camera to
the computer; when you click this utility’s icon,
a dialog box with your camera’s model appears.
From here, you have a choice to download some
or all of your images (stored in your camera’s
memory). You can also access a drop-down
menu (click Options) with various profiles, includ-
ing those you’ve made to calibrate your monitor.
(You’ll want to use your calibration options when
you go to open, edit, and print your images in
Photoshop.) After you download the pictures,
they’re stored in the system’s Pictures folder.

Shooting in Raw format is relatively easy (when your camera offers the 
capability). Within the menu (usually toggled to access while viewing your
camera’s LCD screen) of most dSLR cameras (for more about camera types,
see Chapter 2) is an option to shoot in Raw format. Everything else stays
pretty much the same as in other formats.
Some cameras do not allow you to shoot in Raw format when you’re using an
auto mode. (For more about auto mode, see Chapter 11.)
On most models, shooting in Raw format is only permitted in the Creative
Zone, the zone where many of the settings are freed up to be set by you, the
photographer.
When you edit a Raw photo, you can change the color balance and profile
with the Raw data from the image just as if your camera was doing it during
the shoot. If you convert the same photo to a JPEG file, much information is
thrown away to make the file smaller (compressed), so you don’t have as
much color data to work with. A Raw photo comes to your computer as a 
16-bit image so that the color and detail are strikingly clear. (16-bit color
uses 16 bits — actual zeros and ones at the basic binary level — to record
the color of each pixel. With 16 bits of data, you have an incredible number
of possible different colors.) You need to convert the image to 8-bit color to
save as a JPEG. You can convert to 8-bit color in the Camera Raw dialog box
or by using the Photoshop Edit➪Mode➪8-Bits/Channel command. (In versions
of Photoshop prior to Photoshop CS2, look for the command under the Image
menu rather than the Edit menu.)
After you finish tweaking the white/color balance and levels in Photoshop or
your camera’s Raw processing software, you can save this file as a TIFF file
and proceed with more tweaking in Photoshop or take it straight to press.
Are Raw Files a Raw Deal?
Each camera company makes its own
Raw file format, perhaps because
each wants users to use its com-
pany’s downloading software and
browser. Maybe it’s a prestige thing.
In order to deal with the variety of
formats, Photoshop (www.adobe.com)
has come up with a free converter
(see Figure 16-2) to convert your
image to its .dng format, referred to
as a digital negative of your camera’s
Raw photo format.

Chapter 16: Managing and Preparing Files

Part IV: The Final Output: Gallery-Worthy Prints 
Fuji film’s camera Raw files are labeled .raf. Canon has two kinds (.crw and
.cr2), and Nikon and Olympus have their own, too (.nef and .orf, respec-
tively). With so many file types (and so little time to learn about each), how
does a digital photographer know what’s going to be around next year or in a
decade? Truth is, you won’t.
Understanding the Relationship between 
File Type and File Size
Saving your files as TIFFs is the first
step in keeping your image for a very
long time. File➪Save As is the com-
mand that you use to convert a
file to TIFF format in Photoshop
(see Figure 16-3). There are many
other files listed, but for the digital
photographer who’s interested in
high-resolution, gallery-quality pho-
tographs, TIFF, JPEG, and Raw are
the ones you’ll be interested in using.
TIFF offers some advantages: Its com-
pressions algorithm (LZW), which is
used to reduce the file size, doesn’t
degrade the image quality. Also, TIFF
is compatible with most software
with which you might use your
images.
Defining and constructing a TIFF file in Photoshop
Most of the time, you’ll convert to TIFF from either Raw files or JPEG files. To
save hard drive space, you can make your TIFF file smaller (by about half) by
compressing it. TIFF files don’t compress as tightly as JPEGs do because the
file is compressed in a lossless format. (In other words, when you open the
file again, it’s the same as the original.) Although TIFF format compressed
files are still significantly larger than their JPEG brothers, some is better than
none at all in terms of conserving hard drive space. See Chapter 2 for more
information about JPEG file compression.
Five-megapixel cameras that shoot and store in JPEG (which most do) can give
you a file anywhere from 1MB to 2.5MB, depending on the quality size you
select in the camera’s menu options. That same photo as an uncompressed
TIFF requires about 14MB on your hard drive. With LZW compression (see
Figure 16-4), the TIFF file shrinks to about 7MB, but that’s still much larger
than a JPEG — even at the highest quality setting.
Figure 16-3: Saving file choices in drop-down
Save As menu bar. 

Figure 16-4: Compress TIFF files for quick Internet transfer.
To ensure compatibility (and to make sure you’ll be able to open your TIFF
files years from now), use only LZW compression. Photoshop also offers
JPEG and ZIP compression for TIFF files, but stick with LZW.
Creating a Web Gallery in Photoshop
If you want to put your photos quickly on the Internet, Photoshop has a quick
way of converting not only each file but also setting up everything for you 
so that you can upload to any Web server. Web photos are usually small 
JPEG photos — say, from 4 to 60K. (There’s a GIF format, too, which I don’t
cover here.)
Say you have a set of images of fruit that you want people to see on your Web
site, and you want the images displayed so that users can easily navigate to
them. Use Photoshop’s Web Gallery option to convert your TIFF files to JPEG
and display them on a Web page. The Web accepts only JPEG files and HTML
code (an Internet computer language) to understand what to do with the files
after they’re uploaded to your Web server. (A server is a big computer that
stores a multitude of Web sites.) To convert your high-resolution TIFF files 
to low-resolution JPEG files and the connected HTML code for uploading to
the Internet (which will put them on display quite nicely, thank you), follow
these steps:
1. Locate the images you want to convert to JPEGs and put them into a
folder.
307
Chapter 16: Managing and Preparing Files

308

2. Open Photoshop and choose File➪Browser.
3. In Adobe Bridge, navigate to the folder that contains the images you
want to convert.
Figure 16-5 shows the TIFF files that will be converted.
Figure 16-5: Convert TIFFs to JPEGs.
4. Select all the photos in the folder by pressing Ô+A (Mac) or Ctrl+A
(Windows).
5. Choose Tools➪Photoshop➪Web Photo Gallery and select the settings,
as shown in Figure 16-6, and then click OK.
When Photoshop processes your request, three folders appear on your
Desktop — Images, Pages, and Thumbnails.
6. Your new gallery opens in your default Web browser, ready for your
review and approval.
Web Photo Gallery offers a variety of different templates, with which you can
produce galleries both simple and complex. To make your gallery available
to friends and family via the Internet, contact your Internet service provider
(ISP) or another operation about hosting your Web site. Your ISP can give you
specific instructions for uploading your site to a Web server and assigning an
address, known as a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), by which others can
find and view your gallery.

Figure 16-6: Prepare a Web Gallery here.
Resolving Resolution Issues
If you want a clear print, you should aim to work with an image of at least
300 ppi at your desired print size. With a high-quality inkjet printer, you can
use a somewhat lower resolution, but use 300 ppi as the target resolution.
When copying and pasting lots of stuff from file to file in Photoshop, have a
standard resolution in mind to which you want to set each image. Photoshop
automatically resizes an image if it’s moved from one file to another at differ-
ent resolutions.
Interpolation
When you change an image’s pixel dimensions with the Image➪Image Size
command, you choose an interpolation method, which is an algorithm that
Photoshop uses to re-create the image’s appearance at its new size. To set
an interpolation choice for Photoshop to use when transforming a selection
within an image, choose Photoshop➪Preferences➪General (Mac) or Edit➪
Preferences➪General (Windows).
309
Chapter 16: Managing and Preparing Files

310
Part IV: The Final Output: Gallery-Worthy Prints 
The interpolation options run as follows:
 Nearest Neighbor: I don’t recommend this option for art photos because
it produces rough edges, but it’s great for some simple illustrations.
 Bilinear: This choice results in medium-quality interpolation, so it isn’t a
good option for art photography but can be excellent for blocky or irreg-
ularly shaped artwork.
 Bicubic: This option is fine for small changes to an image, such as minor
resizing or transforming selections.
 Bicubic Smoother: This is a fine interpolation choice when enlarging
images significantly.
 Bicubic Sharper: This option is great for reducing pixel dimensions
because it keeps details sharp and well defined.
When considering enlarging an image for sale as art photography, start with
an artful image — one that still looks good even if it loses resolution.
Resampling an image
Resampling an image, for all practical purposes, is enlarging or reducing the
number of pixels with which the image is formed. The same image content is
there (unlike with cropping), but a different number of pixels is used to repre-
sent the picture. Both increasing the number of pixels in the image (upsampling)
and decreasing the number of pixels (downsampling, which you might do to
create a Web version of a photo) can degrade the appearance of your image.
When upsampling significantly, the image might look a little soft — out of focus.
When downsampling, the fine detail in the image gets lost — eyes become
blobs, grass becomes sheets of green, and diagonal and curved lines in the
image can become jagged. Generally, as an art photographer, you’re most
likely to increase the pixel dimensions of a photo so that it can be printed at
a larger size with good detail.
The left image in Figure 16-7 is a sign containing Egyptian hieroglyphics. I
really liked the bird. This is a good subject for resampling because the blur
that occurs when you resample softens the image — in this case, an image
that took to softening well because it’s etched in stone. I cropped the picture
using the Crop tool from the Tools palette so that only the bird was in the
image and then resampled it using the Bicubic Smoother (see the right image
in Figure 16-7). 
Resampling a person who is small in a picture by enlarging it ten times will
likely not yield a good result, no matter how much you tweak it. Better to
take another picture closer up (which, of course, could also have been done
with the hieroglyph of the bird).

Figure 16-7: Resampling softens images.
You make an image grow, as I demonstrate with the preceding bird image,
by using Photoshop’s Bicubic Smoother interpolation method. Just follow
these steps:
1. Find an image that you think will take well to enlargement.
2. (Optional) If necessary, use the Crop tool to reduce the image to only
the part that you want to enlarge.
3. Choose Image➪Image Size.
4. In the Image Size dialog box that appears, mark the check boxes for
Constrain Proportions and Resample, selecting Bicubic Smoother
as the resampling method.
If the artwork contains layer styles, you also want to select the Scale
Styles check box.
5. In the Document Size area of the dialog box, enter your desired print
dimensions and print resolution (usually 300 ppi).
You might use the upper part of the dialog box when preparing an image
for a Web page, in which case you would need to work with specific pixel
dimensions.
6. When you’re happy with the values, click OK and view your image.
Remember that you can always use the Edit➪Step Backward command
to reverse changes to your image.

Changing resolution without resampling
You might find a situation in which you need to change the resolution of an
image while maintaining the original image’s pixels. This is a trade-off: If you
don’t resample (change the number of pixels), you can change the resolution,
but the print dimensions also change. For example, if you have an image
3000 pixels wide and the image resolution is 72 ppi, the print would be almost
42 inches wide. If you change the image’s resolution to 300 ppi without changing
the actual number of pixels in the image, the print size drops to 10 inches wide.
Or, in a more practical sense, you can change the image’s print dimensions
without resampling, letting Photoshop determine the resolution.
Don’t let your mind lock into 300 ppi as a must-have resolution. It’s generally
better to not resample an image and print at a resolution of 250 ppi (or 360 ppi
or 400 ppi or even perhaps 225 ppi) than it is to resample an image to 300 ppi
for print. Avoid resampling if you can — that prevents the softening or loss of
detail that can come with upsampling or downsampling.
To change an image’s resolution without resampling, just do this:
1. Open the image.
2. Choose Image➪Image Size.
3. Deselect the Resample check box, enter your desired resolution, and
then click OK.

Printing Prep and Printing
In This Chapter
 Following a step-by-step printing process
 Matching your image in Photoshop with your printer output
 Processing your photo for superlative prints
You have many options before you when printing your photos in the digital
realm. You can print directly from iPhoto (on a Mac) or from the options
within the software that came with your digital camera, which also likely con-
tains some basic editing tools such as cropping and enhancing. However, most
professionals and many amateurs use Photoshop to tweak their photos for the
final output. Photoshop provides more alternatives to make sure your image
keeps its detail, color, and contrast. (For more information about your photo’s
life as it’s processed in Photoshop, viewed on your monitor, and transferred
to a printer, see Chapter 3.)
In this chapter, I use a higher-end Epson Stylus Photo
printer. Of course, models vary, but I think Epson makes
excellent printers for art photos. (Many similar models
are available, each printing at a variety of large sizes
and able to print at sizes of 11" x 14" and larger.)
Discovering Proofs and Printing 
the Final Product
After your monitor is calibrated (as discussed in
Chapter 3), you can make a proof — an estimate of what
your print will look like when printed on the type of paper
that you have in your printer — in Photoshop so that what you
see onscreen is what you get in your print. The proof system works pretty
well after you get the hang of it.

314
Part IV: The Final Output: Gallery-Worthy Prints 
Here are the two ways you see an image in the proof-making process:
 How the image is displayed on your monitor in Photoshop’s working
space: This comprises Photoshop’s tools and options and your image(s)
displayed on your monitor.
 From a soft proof: In Photoshop, you can change the color and contrast
of what you see in your working space to the color and contrast of how
your image will look after printing. This copy of your image is a soft proof.
The final result — a hard proof — is the output from your printer.
Your hard proof will never be exactly the same as your soft proof. There are
just too many variables for that to happen, from how your monitor is cali-
brated to what interpretations Photoshop and your printer make from the
colors it passes from one to the other.
You can tweak your soft proof (the copy that will be printed) two ways:
 Look at it and tweak it using your own judgment. This way, you can
just make your original soft proof by going through the steps in
“Preparing for Output” and then tweak it by eye for printing.
 Create a duplicate copy (one that you’ll tweak to look like the original)
before you set up the proof and apply the steps to your duplicate while
you have your original onscreen until the soft proof and the original
copy look alike.
Setting up a proof is a concept that has been taken from the hard copy print
world to your LCD screen. Basically, a soft proof (which I refer to simply as a
proof from here on out) is set up onscreen to see what your printer will print.
There are a multitude of choices in paper and printer models, each with spe-
cific profiles that you need to consider and set in Photoshop. In this example,
I use an Epson printer and print on Epson enhanced matte paper. (The paper
is what takes the ink and makes the color, so this is very important.) Profiles
change when you change the paper you use. (More about that later in this
section.) In the following steps, I show you how to set up your proof and save
it as a profile you can later access. Note: I use Photoshop CS for this example,
but I include notes regarding any changes in Photoshop CS2.
1. With your image open in Photoshop CS, choose View➪Proof Setup➪
Custom (left, Figure 17-1).
The Proof Setup dialog box (right, Figure 17-1) opens, offering choices
(Setup, Profile, Intent, Simulate) that I describe throughout this step list.

Figure 17-1: Begin to make a proof here.
2. For Setup, choose Custom.
I choose Custom because I want a setup that matches my monitor and
enhanced paper. Then I save this setting as phoneverify (see Figure 17-2)
so that I can access it all the time. You have to pick a new paper if you
change to glossy or other fancy papers.
Figure 17-2: My selections for a proof.
315
Chapter 17: Printing Prep and Printing

316
Part IV: The Final Output: Gallery-Worthy Prints 
3. For Profile, choose the type of paper you’re printing on.
Your printer driver software puts settings inside Photoshop from which
you can choose for printing. It is from these settings that Photoshop rec-
ognizes the color of the medium (typically, paper) on which it’s printing.
This is important because the mixture of the paper’s color and texture
with the inks that are set into it is variable. A glossy paper takes ink dif-
ferently than a matte paper, for instance.
I choose EnhancedMatte 2880 (refer to Figure 17-2) because that’s the
paper I’m using, and I want a print at the highest resolution (the 2880 part).
Epson has other choices in this drop-down list, so when I change paper,
I can change this setting.
4. For Intent, choose Perceptual and select the Use Black Point
Compensation check box.
I choose Perceptual because it’s the choice that’s natural to the human
eye. I could have gone with Relative Colorimetric. For vivid images like
graphs or charts, I’d go with Saturation, which is standard and preserves
the original colors more.
5. For Simulate, select the Paper White and the Ink Black check boxes.
This tells Photoshop to match my image colors to the white of the matte
paper.
6. Save the profile by clicking Save and entering a name so that you can
select it each time you later want to print, on any size enhanced matte
paper.
To soft-proof the image — that is, to see an onscreen representation of
what the image will look like when printed — choose View➪Proof Colors.
(Although some folks like to do all their work with Proof Color active, you
might find that it’s better for you to activate the command only when you
want to double-check something in the image.)
Adobe has a system from which you can purchase technical help to solve any
problem you have bringing your final Photoshop image to any type of printer.
Help gurus can take you step by step through each Photoshop dialog box after
you give them the type of paper and printer model that you have. The plan is
worth its cost.
Preparing for Output
With proof in hand, printer turned on, and Photoshop opened to the image
you want to print out, you’re ready to produce your final paper output.

To get proper image quality for printing and selling, you either need to
 Scan your image from a negative or positive, sizing it or saving it when
you download from your camera to your computer.
 Take a picture with a high-end (6 or more megapixels; MP) dSLR
camera and download the picture to your computer and then open 
it in Photoshop. (Choose File➪Open and then navigate to the picture
file in the Open dialog box.)
Point-and-shoot cameras larger than 6MP can also be used for taking pictures
to print at 13" x 19" inches and larger. That doesn’t mean you can’t print your
images fairly clearly with a camera that takes pictures whose size is smaller
than 6MP. It just means they won’t be as clear as those that do.
Sometimes, you need to rotate your canvas if the image looks slightly cock-
eyed. I usually eye it by a line that would be horizontal in a natural setting, like
the horizon if you can see it in your image. Open the file in Photoshop and
do a final rotation of your canvas. Choose Image➪Rotate Canvas➪Arbitrary.
Small values from .5 to 2.0 are usually adequate for rotation clockwise (CW)
or counter-clockwise (CCW) to correct handheld errors on a horizontal plane
and to crop your image.
Select Photoshop’s Measure tool (under the Eyedropper tool in the Toolbox).
Drag the tool along some line in the photo that should be horizontal or vertical.
Now choose Image➪Rotate Canvas➪Arbitrary — the correct angle of rotation
will already be entered, so you need only click OK!
After rotating your image, there are likely to be some areas of white along the
edges. You can use the Clone Stamp tool to cover those areas or crop the image
to eliminate them.
Making a Contact Sheet
Many of Photoshop’s automate tools are great for making art pieces. For
instance, you can create a group of portraits side by side in a new Photoshop

One of the great things about Photoshop is its ability to work with virtually
any image of any size. Use the TIFF format for the best results using any
of Photoshop’s file image manipulation packages in the Automate option
(File➪Automate).

The following example will help you to understand how to set up multiple
files so that they work together to create one image. Just take a series of
images, of anything you want, and then put them together in Photoshop.
1. Take a series of nine photos by setting your camera on an automatic
timer mode.
Make sure that the background of each is at about the same focal length,
as shown in Figure 17-3. Of course, you could make a contact sheet out
of existing photos, in which case you would skip this step and go straight
to Step 2.
Figure 17-3: Select pics from your browser for your contact sheet.
2. Download the images into a folder on your computer in your camera’s
best-quality JPEG format.
You can convert the entire photo collage to TIFF format at the end.
3. In Photoshop, choose File➪Automate➪Contact Sheet II and select your
Source folder.
4. Choose your page size/resolution and select the number of rows and
columns necessary to fit all the images in that folder onto one page.
Remember to choose the printable area of your page (such as 8" x 10")
rather than the paper size (8.5" x 11") to allow room for the printer’s

margins. Because this image is destined to be printed as art, make sure
to use 300 pixels per inch (ppi) as your resolution.
5. Deselect the Use Filename as Caption option (for an art photo) and
click OK.
6. Save your image as a TIFF file.
You can, of course, apply some of your Photoshop magic to the resulting
image. You might, for example, decide that the collage has more impact as a
grayscale image (see Figure 17-4). 
Figure 17-4: Contact sheets can be used for a variety of purposes.
Previewing Your Print
I continue processing my image for print within the Print with Preview dialog
boxes. It’s here that you set your printer to use Photoshop’s colors and not
Epson’s or Canon’s (or whatever printer model you have); you also specify
the size of your paper and where on the paper you want your print.
1. To access Print with Preview, choose File➪Print with Preview.

2. When the Print dialog box
comes up, click the Page Setup
button to specify your paper
size and print orientation
(in the resulting Page Setup
dialog box).
I set my printer for (Epson)
Stylus 2200 Photo US letter
size. (All the Epson 2200 size
possibilities are within this
menu pop-up.) I also click the
Orientation icon that indicates
landscape mode. See Figure 17-5.
After you make your choices, click OK to close the Page Setup dialog box.
3. Back in the Print dialog box, set your printing options.
In particular, in the Print Space profile (Printer Profile in CS2), make sure
to select the printer’s profile for the paper on which you’re printing.
4. Click Print and select your preset quality print choice.
The printer’s own Print dialog box opens, from which you make a selec-
tion from the Presets drop-down list.
I choose the mattequality preset. I saved this option because I print on
this paper type again and again.
If your preset is already chosen,
scroll through the drop-down
menu and then reclick the preset
to set it again. Otherwise, the
image falls into default mode.
5. Turn off the printer’s own
color management.
The last thing that I do is to
choose Color Management from
the drop-down menu that falls
after the Printer and Presets
menus. Because I don’t want the
printer to decide my colors for
me — I want Photoshop to
decide — I select the No Color
Adjustment radio button, as
shown in Figure 17-6.

Framing and Matting
In This Chapter
 Buying or making mats
 Configuring mats for your photography
 Buying and assembling frames
 Framing on the cheap
H
ow you frame your print has a great impact on its value. Your options
are many in terms of finding a display for your digital photographs. If
you’re on a budget or just starting out, you can refurbish old frames or learn
the craft of making or putting together the frames and mats yourself. If you’re
preparing high-end art for galleries and upscale stores, there are many places
from which you can order frames and mats and other accessories online or
through traditional retail.
Many galleries want only frame jobs that comprise pro-
fessional mounting and acid-free papers. Read more about
using acid-free papers and why they’re important in the
section, “Takin’ It to the Mats.” 
Finding mats for your photographs goes hand-in-
hand with finding frames for your photographs.
When making framing choices, consider both the
presentation of your work as well as how to protect
it. You also have to consider the tastes and styles of
your potential clients.
For the examples in this chapter, I show mats that are on
the conservative end of the art spectrum because galleries
and many stores want simple mats and frames for photogra-
phy. You’ll likely see many other options when you view mats for
sale online or in catalogs, so keep your creativity and tastes in mind if you
go with more fancy matting and framing.

322
Part IV: The Final Output: Gallery-Worthy Prints 
At the end of the chapter are a few tips to help you put a picture inside ready-
made frames. For the purposes of clarity in this book, the two types of frames
that I refer to are
 Ready-made frames: These frames are put together for you, ready
to accept your photo. They typically include the glass, the frame, and
backboard (and sometimes the mat). All that’s left is to put your picture
inside. You can buy ready-mades in bulk.
 Custom-made frames: These frames are ones in which the entire frame
is made for you with your picture in it. Although the convenience factor
is high, this is an expensive method and I don’t recommended using
these for art photos that you sell.
Takin’ It to the Mats
Mats, which are placed between the photo and the glass for both protective
and aesthetic purposes, come in all colors, shapes, and sizes. Just about any-
thing you want in terms of mat geometry is available. By mat geometry, I mean
that you can find mats with openings other than the traditional squares and
rectangles — oval, round, triangular. And complementing your photograph
with a decent, reasonably priced mat is easier than ever. Stores today — both
online and brick-and-mortar — can supply you with what you need to make
your own or make them for you. Photography frames are easy to order, too,
because of the specialized mats just for this purpose. I usually get my frames
and mats together at the same place. To cut costs (especially when I try to
sell a print for a higher profit), I shop around for the least-expensive mats
that fit the frames I get from another supplier. Read more about where you
can get mats and frames wholesale later in this chapter.
Before you start searching for mats, a little lesson in mat lingo will make
things easier when you order. It’s the language the mat guys use so they can
build the right mat for your work. When you order your mats, whether you
do so online or in a local frame shop, the framers will want to know how you
want your image orientated, what size it is, as well as a few other pertinent
pieces of information:
 Orientation: Let the framer know how you want your picture set up in
the mat. Figure 18-1 shows you the ins and outs of landscape, portrait,
and bottom-weighted orientation for mats and their openings.
 Size: State the shorter dimension first. For example, use 11 x 14 (inches)
and not 14 x 11 (inches). That is, an 8 x 10 is always an 8 x 10 regardless
of whether you display it landscape or portrait.

Always order your mat opening about an eighth to a quarter of an inch
smaller than the image you’ll place under it. For example, to order a mat
for an 8" x 10" photo, order the opening cut to 73⁄4" x 93⁄4". If you don’t, you
could risk having the backing paper show up in the opening.
 Double matting: You don’t need to state the dimensions of both mats.
If your outer mat is 11" x 14", your inner mat will be one inch less, or
10" x 13". One inch on each side is the industry standard. For art photos,
double matting is not common. Instead, many professionals choose a
thicker mat.
 Acid-free: Sometimes called conservation quality, an acid-free mat isn’t
as susceptible to fading as ordinary mats and is important to prevent
degradation of the photo paper.
 Color: Stick with basic white for a mat for your photo to satisfy the har-
mony it gives with the medium, especially if you’re going to be evaluated
by a professional for a gallery presentation. I think that white is the best
color to use for a mat. If you have to play with color, go with pastels, like
robin’s egg blue. Of course, though, you might think that gray or black
best complements your photograph.

If your piece is designed to match OPP (a 1980s abbreviation meaning other
people’s property — most likely, their sofa), go to the local furniture store and
ask the clerk what items people have been buying lately. Or, work with your
client to match colors appropriately.
Comparing mat options
Whether you present your work to a high-brow gallery or sell your work in
the neighborhood shabby chic palace, the advantages and disadvantages of
mat buying for each kind of mat are described in Table 18-1. Prices in the table
reflect the prices for acid-free mats.

Old mats can be discolored.
Cutting your own mats
You can certainly save money and have a lot of creative control when you cut
you own mats. Purchase a mat cutter and mat boards and have at it. A variety
of mat cutters are available. Check out www.rockler.com to find small mat
cutters starting at $20 as well as a serious 40-inch cutter for $195. (At this
site, on the left, under Departments, choose Tools➪Picture Framing to see
the cutters.) The high-end cutters include sliding guides and stops to make
sure you don’t overrun your cut. This Web site also includes a handbook for
picture framing, “Home Book of Picture Framing” by Ken Oberrecht.

Buying mat board to cut is simple. You can easily order board online from
places like http://jerrysartarama.com, which features acid-free mat boards
that are reasonably priced. (Acid-free mat boards are made with materials
that won’t destroy your photos.) Boards (30" x 42") from this site run from
$4 to $7 per piece. (A minimum order of 12 boards is required, and returns
are not accepted.)
Small mat cutters, available at local art supply stores, allow you to make hand
cuts with small guides (but you have to keep a steady hand). They’re not easy
to use, requiring great coordination to make the right kind of cut. An example
is a Dexter Mat Cutter ($26.88) with a plastic knob that allows for cutting at
any angle or depth.
When you cut a mat opening, you create a beveled edge — a very small
45° angle on the edge of the opening — while you cut, working within the
thickness of the board, a place that’s only a fraction of an inch thick. This can
be a little tricky. Still, if you’re adventurous and want to cut your own mats,
it’s not like you need the dexterity of a heart surgeon. It’s only cardboard.
Cutting your own mats lets you make any size you want and ends up being
cheaper in the long run.
Keep these hints in mind when you do:
 The more you do, the easier it gets. Go ahead and take the first step.
That’s the hardest step — actually doing it.
 Gather all your framing tools upfront. You need a mat cutting kit, ruler,
tape (double-faced), a burnishing tool, a razor blade, and linen tape.
You can find mat kits at www.logangraphic.com.
Creating a mat in Photoshop
A mat doesn’t have to be a physical piece of board; it can alternatively be
something you craft within Photoshop as part of the image itself. Here’s how:
1. From an open image, choose Window➪Layers to see your Layers
palette.
For more about layers, see Chapter 14.
2. Double-click the Background layer in the Layers palette and rename
the layer.
This converts the background layer into a regular layer so that you can
add a layer mask.
325
Chapter 18: Framing and Matting

326
Part IV: The Final Output: Gallery-Worthy Prints 
3. To mask out part of the image so that you can frame it, use the
Rectangular Marquee tool to select the part of the picture that you
want framed, as shown in Figure 18-2.
Figure 18-2: Choose the portion of the image you’ll see in the digital frame.
4. Click the Add Layer Mask button at the bottom of the Layers palette.
See the result in Figure 18-3.
Figure 18-3: Select a layer mask.

The checkerboard area that you can see in the figure means that there’s
nothing there yet — no color, no picture, nothing. That’s where the mat
goes. Don’t think that Photoshop tried to be “helpful” and created a
checked mat for you.
5. To add the equivalent of a mat, use the Stroke effect. Click the second
icon — the Add a Layer Style button — at the bottom of the Layers
palette, as shown in Figure 18-4.
Figure 18-4: Choose the stroke effect.
6. Choose your stroke settings — color, size, and position (Outside to
create a mat effect). Drag the Layer Style dialog box to the side and
watch what happens to the image as you move each slider.
Make sure the Preview check box is marked and move the sliders until
you get what you like. You can see the settings I chose in Figure 18-5.
7. Add a new layer by clicking the New Layer icon in the Layers palette
(next to the trash can at the bottom) and move the new layer below
your image layer in the Layers palette.
To change the order of the layers, click the new layer in the Layers palette
and drag it downward until you see a heavy black line below the original
layer; then release the mouse button.
8. Select a color for the mat.

b. Select the Eyedropper tool.
c. Find a place on the image where you like the color and click around
until you see a color that you like in the foreground color swatch.
d. Select the Paint Bucket tool.
e. Click anywhere in your image to fill the lower layer with the
selected color.
The “matted” image is shown in Figure 18-6.

Try using different Photoshop filters — Noise➪Add Noise followed by Glass,
Mosaic, or Gaussian Blur — on your mat layer for cool effects to make a poster
out of your art. Read more about this in Photoshop CS Timesaving Techniques
For Dummies (Phyllis Davis, Wiley).
The Great Frame-Up
Framing can be just as artful as the photography itself. If the frame isn’t right
for the photograph, you lose the total effect. And if you’re trying to market
your art, people won’t buy it.
Your framing options are varied:
 Frame kits: You can order framing kits that include everything — glass/
Plexiglass, hangers, pads (so the frame doesn’t knock against the wall),
mats, backing boards — but that need to be assembled. See the later
section, “Buying online; finding Internet deals,” for shopping sites that
carry these kits. 
Speaking of hangers . . . there are a few kinds:
• Wires that stretch from one side to the other on the frame: These are
time consuming to put on.
• One-piece metal hangers: These are my favorite because all you
have to do is hammer them onto the frame.
• Metal hangers with screws: Ugh. You need to have microscopic vision
and robot hands to set and screw those beasts into the frame.
329
Chapter 18: Framing and Matting
Make your own poster
To gain your own sense of style, you can make a
poster with text and image. You can decide on an
era you want to re-create or a specific theme you
want to create and choose a text that matches it.
Images that are taken of shady spots (like under a
tree over a lake in a park) and overexposed by +1.5
result in an exposure can look Impressionistic
when printed. Add some borders and text that
matches the image and you’ve got your own
poster. Mass-produced posters are some of the
most common saleable art in stores today.

Part IV: The Final Output: Gallery-Worthy Prints 
 Order by parts: You can order everything in parts from the four sides of
aluminum frames to the hardware to put them together, each at its own
price. Many artists order metal frames from Light Impressions this way.
Their frames are professional quality but need to be assembled. Check
out www.lightimpressionsdirect.com for their aluminum frame kits.
When choosing a frame, always consider your photograph. For example, you
probably wouldn’t want to put a heavy carved wooden frame around a photo-
graph that’s light and feminine (say, of your friend, the supermodel, splashing
in the pool). Here are some examples of frame types and appropriate art to
place within them:
 Thick carved wooden frames: These are great for cowboy/western or
rustic photos. Sometimes a slimmed-down version of these frames can
be a pleasant surrounding for nature photos.
 Traditional black photography frames: Sepia and black-and-white
(B&W) photos look clean and professional in these types of frames.
 Silver metal frames: Something very modern looks good inside a metal-
lic frame — say, glistening skyscrapers or city lights reflected on a body
of water. 
 Bamboo-style frames: Especially popular nowadays, a frame like this
fits well with a print that’s tropical or Polynesian themed. Try a bamboo-
textured mat to add to the theme. (Color families are important here;
use accents in reds and browns. See Chapter 1 for more about color 
families.)
 Bright white frames with bright white mats: This is what I use for my
midcentury images. Many people in Southern California have modern
homes with white walls. Framing signs in pure white blends with
the walls so viewers can imagine they’re looking at a real sign.
Here are other frame considerations:
 Size: Frame dimensions are usually given from the inside of the frame,
so 11" x 14" is the size of the opening of the frame and of the mat you’ll
put inside it. Obviously, if the molding (the actual frame material) is wide,
the outside frame dimensions can be bigger.
 Style: Think of style as you would a bureau of drawers or other piece of
furniture. Styles range from simple 18th-century Americana to embell-
ished Spanish Colonial to (of course) simple contemporary, which is
usually the most popular for photography. Figure 18-7 shows two types
of frames that work with different photographic subject matter.
 Material: Frames come in a variety of materials, from synthetic material,
such as polystyrene, to natural woods and metals. Any are suitable for
photography.

Figure 18-7: Use different frames for different types of photos.
 Color: Basic black, the best
choice of colors for your frame,
is what galleries choose when
displaying photographs. This has
been the trend, but it’s changing
as photographers are getting
more creative. Basic white, a
color befitting a contemporary
style, is more popular now, and
I use it often (see Figure 18-8).
In fact, I frame in all white
because my most popular 
subject — mid-20th-century 
signage — looks good that way.
 Cut: Choosing a frame can be
daunting because of the thou-
sands of moldings to choose
from. Molding, the material from
which framemakers make the
frame, comes in a variety of
widths, thicknesses, and cuts.
The cuts can be flat or angled or curved, sometimes using multiple inun-
dations in the cut, all according to the style of the frame.

perfect final touch for an art photo.

332
Part IV: The Final Output: Gallery-Worthy Prints 
Here’s what you should have on hand before you order and buy:
 The size of your image: I prefer making 8" x 10" images because I can sell
them at a reasonable price. Making and printing them is less expensive
both because of the ink required for the printer and the reasonably
priced paper you can get at that size.
 Know the size of your frame opening: The size of your mat is the same
size as your frame opening. With a good area of white space (yes, I recom-
mend white mats only for photography), the viewer is directed toward
the image.
Buying retail
You can find dozens of framing shops all over the world. However, you pay
for convenience and expertise: Most retail custom framers charge three to
four times more than what you’d pay buying a ready-made frame and putting
the picture in yourself.
Most retail stores change the types of frames they offer by season. If you want
a consistent product, buying at a retail outlet can be frustrating because what
they have one month, they won’t have the next.
Buying online; finding Internet deals
Quality is important in a frame, and when you shop online, you obviously
can’t tell how substantial the frame in terms of its weight or size. However,
my experience has been that after you get used to buying on the Internet,
frames and mats you end up with are as good as what you buy retail — and
sometimes even better.
I went shopping for a 14" x 18" frame at a couple of outlets on the Internet. I
realize that the quality of some frames is better than others, and thus, more
expensive. For you bargain-hunters, here are the details and prices I found at
the time of writing:
 SendAFrame, http://sendaframe.com: A bony wood, beveled, classic
11" x 14" frame with glass display is $22; arctic white, acid-free mat is
about $10. Shipping costs vary by number of items shipped ($6 for the
first and $2 for each additional; arrives in 3 to 5 business days [shipping
is higher for faster delivery]; minimum order for most frames is two pieces.
Some frame models come in packages of a dozen (like the ebony, black,
wooden basic by Perennials; a pack of 12 is $81).

 pictureframes.com, www.pictureframes.com: The Black Tie Affair 
14" x 18" frame is $39. Very-white rag (acid-free) 14" x 18" mat is about
$12. Shipping costs vary by the price of the order, starting at $7 for
orders less than $25 to $35 for orders around $300, all for next-business-
day delivery. A 40 percent mix-and-match discount is available.
 Picture Frames R Us, http://picture-frames-r-us.com: A black
gallery 14" x 17" (yes, really, 14" x 17") frame with mat is about $40.
Shipping is a flat rate per order of $8, arriving in 5 to 10 business days.
Minimum orders vary with stock ordered.
 Picture This...Framed, http://Picturethisframed.com: A flat black
14" x 18" wall frame, with single conservation-grade mat (acid free), clear
acrylic glazing (glass substitute), and rigid board backing is about $64.
Shipping charges range from $7 to $20; arrives in 3 to 5 business days.
No minimum order is required.
Buying for the bargain
Although you can save a ton of money by buying your framing materials online,
you can also find a local wholesaler or dig through thrift stores. In this section,
I discuss how to buy wholesale and offer a few other cash-saving ideas for
getting great frames and mats.
333
Chapter 18: Framing and Matting
Your time is valuable
Streamlining your framing process saves you time
and money. Although it can be more cost efficient
to order mats from one place and frames from
another, you’re less likely to make errors in order-
ing if you order everything from the same place.
Bonus:If that merchant makes a mistake, you can
send the materials back and have them redone.
And speaking of getting it right the first time,
getting your print right the first time also saves
time and money; there’s nothing worse than
having a frame put together and finding that the
image was printed wrong. Printing mistakes are
easy to make and can also be expensive
because each print uses quite a bit of ink — not
to mention the paper. Always check each dimen-
sion twice: both your mat size openings and the
height and width of your frame’s inner opening
and overall size. Keep a record of these mea-
surements in an Excel chart or Word table along
with the number of each print, especially if you
are printing limited editions (when you print a
specified number of prints for the same image).
Finally, know the style of the mat you want before
you choose your frame. Most framemakers offer
mats with a variety of shapes for an opening.
Although round openings and other such flares
are nice, especially for older photos, you’ll typi-
cally choose a traditional square opening.

334
Part IV: The Final Output: Gallery-Worthy Prints 
Wholesale deals
You want to contact wholesale framers if you’re buying large quantities of
frames — say, 30–40 or more. These are the folks to cozy up to when you want
to find the people who make the frames, cut the mats, cut the glass/Plexiglas,
and assemble the parts so that all you have to do is open up the frame and
put in the photo.
Buying frames and mats wholesale usually means you need to buy in bulk.
However, bulk in the frame world doesn’t mean that you have to spend thou-
sands of dollars. Most places, both online and traditional stores, accept
orders starting at $100–$200 dollars. If you plan to sell in a high-end store or
work with a gallery, you need the same frame or type of frame for your
images — and a lot of them — so buying in bulk makes sense.
As for buying mats in bulk, you can buy them for about $2 per piece, cut to a
variety of sizes and for a variety of odd-sized prints.
If you’re in the United States and order abroad — even from Canada — those
businesses will likely ask you for your Social Security number. The Security
Assistance Act of 2002 requires full electronic filing of all export information,
which means that you must provide your Social Security number when you
are shipped items from another country. And you always have the choice: If
you don’t want to give out your number, find a domestic supplier. For more
information, go to customs.ustreas.gov.
Table 18-2 lists places where you can get ready-made frames wholesale.
These shops offer a consistent supply so that you can go back and buy the
same frame.
Many retail outlets and chain art stores such as Aaron Brothers Art Marts
offer a wide selection of frames at good prices. Be on the lookout for sales via
the Internet and in the newspapers. Get on mailing lists to receive coupons.
These places are a blessing if you run out of stock when people want pictures
fast: Vendors like this offer a wide selection of photography frames and pre-
cut mats at good prices.

Other great deals
You can find great deals on frames and framing supplies if you’re willing to
look around a bit. This list offers just a few more ideas on where to find great
frames at great prices:
 Discount designers: Many contemporary designers use mass produc-
tion to make affordable high-brow decorations for the home. This trend
is a throwback to the 1950s when famous designers mass produced
good-quality furnishings and made them cheap enough so more people
could afford them. Here are just two examples:
• Umbra (www.umbra.com), a home design company, offers frames that
are great for photography and for your smaller pictures. An 8" x 10"
inch frame by Tom Vincent has layered glass inserts that make the
multiple photos this frame holds look as if they’re floating. Umbra
also has 11" x 14" Media frames ($22) available in six variations, made
of aluminum with white, bevel-cut mats to hold your photo sets.
• Ikea (www.ikea.com), a Swedish company, has huge outlet stores
in major cities around the world that offer a great selection of
frames. Most of their frames, however, do not come with mats, so
look over the “Takin’ It to the Mats” section, earlier in this chapter,
and then order your mats using metric measurements. Any framer
will understand these dimensions. For more about metric measure-
ments, see the nearby sidebar, “It’s English in the U.S. but metric
everywhere else.”

 Thrift stores: There they are, dozens of cast-offs stacked in a lonely
corner, stray frames looking for new life in someone’s home.
Refurbishing used frames from a thrift store is the most inexpensive alter-
native to traditional framing. Your options are limitless; millions of old
but perfectly good frames are given to charities for sales at thrift stores
every year. And the good news is that not many people sift through them,
looking for a standard frame that you’d use for photography. Put in a good
mat, and you have a saleable art piece. And if you’re lucky, a useable mat
will come with your frame.
You might have to sand and paint a thrift store frame because of bumps
and nicks. Overall, though, ones I find in thrift stores are very refurbish-
able. When painting a frame, sand it lightly first (wood or metal) and
then apply a flat or semigloss paint.
 Nonprofit organizations: Many nonprofit organizations, faith-based work
programs, and other charities are in the framing business. A good exam-
ple on the Internet is www.kandu.org, which works with the Michigan
Rehabilitation Services and Community Mental Health to train workers.
From their picture frame manufacturing plant that employs these work-
ers in Holland, Michigan, you can order mats and frames by the box
(from a selection of 150 molding choices). Orders can be placed by
phoning 800-747-0728.
 Garage sales/flea markets: The possibility of finding great frames at a
garage sale or flea market can be as limitless as at a thrift store. You
have to scour these venues to find a gem or two — and you also proba-
bly have to refurbish what you find — but the prices can’t be beat.

Chapter 18: Framing and Matting
Earn extra income by selling art retail
Here’s what I do. I order from a wholesaler who is
a framer whom I found out about from an artist
who sells at our local street fair. Every month, I
pick up 30–40 frames to refill my stock. The whole-
saler (City Art) charges me a fixed price each time
for a 16" x 16" white frame and matching mat with
an 8" x 10" opening. I also make smaller 11" x 14"
prints for the Neon Museum to sell in Los Angeles,
the home design store Room Service in Los
Angeles, and Palm Springs Consignment, a local
midcentury modern store, to sell in Palm Springs.
When I get the frames home, I go to work print-
ing and numbering my images. I pull the exist-
ing staples from the frame, take out the mat, and
then use white art tape to put my image behind
the mat that came with the frame. Then I make
my deliveries once a month to the three places
that sell my art. (For the steps involved in fram-
ing your photos, see the later section, “Putting
Together the Frame.”)

338
Part IV: The Final Output: Gallery-Worthy Prints 
Putting Together the Frame
At some point, you’ll put your ready-made frame together: that is, put your
picture inside. Here are some steps to help you through the process:
1. Gather the appropriate materials.
Figure 18-9 shows the parts:
• Photograph: Your masterpiece!
• Frame/mat: Chosen and cut for this particular photo.
Figure 18-9: Take the frame apart so you can sign the mat and tape the 
picture to it.
It’s English in the U.S. but metric everywhere else
Many places around the world use the metric
system to measure art, including frames. Ikea
offers great frames but uses this system to mea-
sure them. If shopping non-U.S. places for your
frames, convert your images to metric mea-
surements in Photoshop, which offers metric
measurements in its Image Size dialog box
(access by clicking the drop-down menu bar
next to the height and width input options). If
you’re shopping where metric measurements
are used, try converting your image to 20cm x
30cm and printing it out before you go shopping.
That way, you’ll be able to find a frame that fits.
Ikea offers bulk frames of good quality at whole-
sale prices. 

• White artist’s tape/scissors: To affix the photo to the mat.
• Glass cleaner/cloth: To clean the frame before assembly.
• Pencil/eraser: To sign and clean up your mat.
• Staple gun: To put the frame backing on the frame when you’re done.
2. Disassemble the frame.
The backing typically comes stapled to the frame. You need to remove the
backing (and also the mat, if you ordered one from the same company)
so you can put the picture inside.
3. Sign and number your mat.
Create a unique artful signature of your very own. Your signature should
go on the bottom right of your mat; put the number of the print on the
bottom left. If you have a name for your print, put it there also. The name
for my print is Tucson angled because it’s my second version of this pic-
ture. It will be numbered 1/50 because I make limited editions of 50.
Signing your name in pencil on the mat is perfectly appropriate for pho-
tography artwork. If you use pencil and make a mistake when writing on
your mat, use a magic Rub eraser (available at art stores) to get pencil
marks and other smudges off your mat.
4. Put just one piece of white artist tape, sticky side up, on your print
along the top, as shown in Figure 18-10.
Attaching your mat to your picture requires only one piece of white art
tape at the top of your picture. Using only one piece of tape allows the
paper to grow and shrink in different weather conditions without rip-
pling in the frame. Hint: You could also use acid-free photo corners
along with the tape to help hold the photo in place.
Figure 18-10: Attach your tape sticky side up so you can put the mat on top.

Part IV: The Final Output: Gallery-Worthy Prints 
Another method is to mount the picture. While some folks think that this
hurts the true artistic quality of the print, it makes it impossible for your
picture to wrinkle. Most frame shops have mounting machines as do
FedEx Kinko’s. 
5. Clean the inside of the frame with glass cleaner and let it dry.
6. Place the mat (with the photo taped to it) inside the frame.
7. Clear away any dust or other foreign material inside the frame and
then staple the backing to the frame.
8. Attach a hanger if necessary.
For more on hanger options, see the earlier section, “The Great Frame-Up.”
My final product is shown in Figure 18-11.

Part V
The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
his section contains only two chapters, but
they’re jam-packed with to-the-point info:
the ten guidelines of digital art photography
(Chapter 19) and ten very useful digital art tricks
(Chapter 20).

19
Ten Photo Digital Art Rules
A
rt is a lot of things to a lot of people. Create what you will, and what
sells will follow . . . perhaps with a few tweaks in Photoshop, perhaps
with a grainy image of your grandmother’s backyard, or perhaps just being
at the right place at the right time.
With Photoshop CS2 by your side, using its tools, like the cool new perspec-
tive options or Raw file capabilities, your images are perfectly ripe to become
priceless images when you easily correct errors (like under- or overexposing
pictures) with the click and drag of a slider.
These ten rules are easy to remember and can make your art more appealing
as well as saleable.
Create with Classic 
Lines and Colors
The word appealing means different things to different
people, especially in art. However, following your
instincts with light, color, shape, and form (as I 
discuss in Chapter 1) and maybe a rule or two
(say the Rule of Thirds) can help you produce a 
picture — like Figure 19-1 — that’s attractive
in many décors.

344
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Figure 19-1: Light, color, and contrast produce desirable wall art. 

Start with a Good Camera
The newest point-and-shoot
cameras — both digital and film —
produce some great results, like the
photo shown in Figure 19-2. However,
the spiffier (and pricier) digital SLRs
(dSLRs) and film SLRs have more
options, including toys that provide
you with quicker response time
when you press the shutter as well
as additional manual settings that let 
you adjust your f-stops and shutter
speeds in different light and contrast
environments. Higher-end point-
and-shoots (5 megapixel [MP] and
higher) as well as dSLRs/film SLRs can produce effects that can deepen your
colors and/or make your image look like an art piece. Both are suitable for
you to create an outstanding photo, especially if you have fine weather and
can balance your f-stop and shutter speed (as discussed in Chapter 6) to get
the best of the scene and/or action.
Exploit the Right Light 
for Your Photo
From natural light’s spectacular dawn
and dusk window, where subtle light
provides soft shadows, all photos are
light dependent. Although you can
certainly shoot indoors and use flash
fill to augment existing light or pro-
vide the light you need, photos often
look their best when shot under nat-
ural lighting conditions. The softness
that natural light provides is often far
superior than what emanates from
artificial sources. Train your eye to
seek out existing light, as in this
photo of a plate of fresh bakery
bagels (see Figure 19-3).
345
Chapter 19: Ten Photo Digital Art Rules
Figure 19-2: Most middle-level and high-end
cameras can shoot good photos.
Figure 19-3: One light source and no flash
makes these bagels fresh forever.

346
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Keep It Small and
Spectacular
Whether tiny wildflowers in a field,
random and spontaneous, or a
hybrid annual, fertilized and cod-
dled, flowers shot at the macro level
are transformed into other-worldly
creations that captivate and explode
with color. To get this close to your
subject (as I did in Figure 19-4), use a
macro lens or the macro lens setting
(which most midrange and high-end
digital cameras have). For more
about lenses and cameras, see
Chapter 2.
Balance Items Onscreen and on Paper
Whether you’re shooting or cropping your photo, balancing images is half the
fun and a good part of the creativity in your art photography. Creating a sense
of balance when taking a picture of a sculptural form is easy: It’s already been
done for you by the sculptor. What’s important for you, the photographer, is
to add foreground (or not add it); enhance color that puts your imprint on
the remade art.
When taking pictures of signage, for
example, I look for balance — lots of
it, but not necessarily in the object
of a whole because many parts of
objects spark interest among view-
ers. Feel free to shoot from a weird
angle or include objects that are of
the same color or form, like a trio
of pink clowns, a long row of silver
bullet trains, or the gap between
subway cars shot from the view-
point of a child (stoop or lie down
for this one), as shown in Figure 19-5.
Figure 19-5: Craft your photos with balance.
Figure 19-4: Shoot up close for great
perspective.

Organize Your Photos into Sets by Themes
Think in themes, from repetition to
solitude to fun. Categorize your
photos by subject to get started.
Consider sports, transportation, or
flying as themes. Transportation can
have subcategories within it —
motorized versus nonmotorized vehi-
cles, for instance — to get even more
focused. Figure 19-6 shows a horse-
drawn carriage that emulates those of
bygone eras, yet the picture was taken
recently in the hippest section of
San Diego, the Gas Lamp district.
The photo fits into a number of themes, too, from photos of horses to trans-
portation to moving things. Photo sets can help you resell an image many
times and also provide you with an opportunity to sell more than one photo at
once because they come as a set. (For
more on photo sets, see this book’s
companion Web site, www.dummies.
com/go/digitalartphotos.)
Know the Art Techniques
of Thine Masters
You can emulate any masters, but
instead of duplicating their work,
create a new version, perhaps from
a new perspective or a change of
hues. Figure 19-7 shows a photo
of the same church that van Gogh
painted, which I tweaked using color
balance and Photoshop’s Twirl
and Clouds filters. For more on
using filters in Photoshop, see
Chapter 15.

themes.
Figure 19-7: Emulate the masters’ works using
Photoshop.

348
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Create a Story or Message
Capture as much detail and essence of your subject as possible in your
photos to tell a story (as in Figure 19-8) or impart a message. For example,
you’re better off photographing a chef in a kitchen than in a silver mine
(unless he’s mining for truffles, I suppose). You don’t have to step back and
photograph to tell your story; you can also photograph close-up to get the
details. For more about using photo sets to tell a story, see this book’s com-
panion Web site.
Figure 19-8: Create a story with photos.
Capture the Unexpected or Unreal
Artists often express themselves through the sur-
real. Salvador Dali painted forms that went beyond
humanity in form and color to explain his fears and
hopes. Figure 19-9 is a perfect example, featuring
a man walking through a wall. (How often do you
see that?)
Sculptural elements ordinarily don’t provide much
contrast to make an appealing photograph. Using
Photoshop’s options when the photo is still in Raw
format, you can tweak for contrast without losing
detail and adding noise. There are multiple sliders
(for exposure and contrast) that appear when your
image comes up in a special Raw format window
that you click and drag to change the look of your
picture with almost the same results that you
would get making the same changes out in the
field. Add feeling to a photo like this by enhancing
the details of the man’s face as well as tweaking
the foreground/background to see the rock and cement in which the man is
embedded.
Figure 19-9: Always keep an
eye open for the unusual.

Always Have Your 
Camera with You
TV commercials used to call it a
Kodak moment — those perfect 
snippets of life that demanded to
be captured on film. When you
always have a camera with you,
you’ve got a sporting chance of
catching all those vignettes of life
that define us all. The ease and
portability of digital cameras (as long
as you have batteries) can help you
sigh in relief that you were glad you
had your camera. There’s nothing
like the concentration of a child
when she or he is first learning how
to ride a bicycle, or when, at only
three years old, a boy decides to
take to a skateboard, as shown in
Figure 19-10.

Ten Digital Art Tricks
A
fantasy is a dream that comes true. Digital art tricks can be those
dreams, and they can come alive, beginning with thoughtful shots aug-
mented with your creative use of Photoshop (or other image processors),
from processing your Raw format photos to changing the hue and saturation
of your image.
Real art begins with your imagination. In this chapter, I list a few tricks to
help you to master image processing technology to get the best creative
product possible.
Overexpose and Underexpose
As I discuss in Chapter 5, you can do a lot to make your image stunning while
you shoot outdoors. When the sun shines on your subject, change your
exposure compensation so that it reads in the minus column
(underexposure) to deepen your colors. When you’re shooting
in deep shade, try upping your exposure compensation to
the plus column (overexposure). You’ll get an artsy effect
that’s almost impressionistic.
Photoshop CS2 comes to your aid also, letting you
do anything you want with your exposure by just
sliding the exposure slider when your image is in
Raw format (if your camera shoots in that file type)
just as if you were shooting. That’s right! You can
open and tweak your image in Raw format and get a
chance to fool with your camera controls just as if you
were on the shoot. (Yeah, that’s right — no pixilation or
image deterioration that you get when you tweak an image
when it’s in TIFF format. Read more about Raw file format in
Chapter 16.) In Figure 20-1, altering the exposure changes the
focus of the image as well as its appearance.

352
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Figure 20-1: Raw files let you change your exposure just as you would while shooting. 
Emulate the Masters
Some artists are easy to imitate via
Photoshop techniques. For example,
check out the Andy Warhol-like com-
posite in Chapter 15. Run a search on
other masters’ names in a search
engine to find other classic works
and styles that you can re-create and
tweak with your own style.
Figure 20-2 shows a staged piece
(I hung a black sheet behind the 
subject and dressed him in dark
clothing) — a Rembrandt replica, if
you will. I searched for Rembrandt to
come up with ideas that capture the
view or mood with which I wanted to
Figure 20-2: Emulate the masters with
composition and filters.

match my subject. In this case, the subject matched one of Rembrandt’s
almost to the tee. I then tweaked the original using a series of Photoshop’s fil-
ters and options, much in the same way Rembrandt did on his canvas —
applying layer after layer of paint to tweak the color and texture to achieve a
surreal darkness. It works the same way in Photoshop — that is, you’ll proba-
bly apply a series of different filters and/or options until you’re satisfied. See
Chapter 15 for more about Photoshop filters.
Shoot on a Cloudy Day
Light shining on objects makes color
and shadows. Conversely, clouds
and overcast conditions remove
color and shadows. The gray tones
resulting from a lack of shadows are
filled with emotion. A broken wooden
park bench among autumn leaves
(see Figure 20-3), inches deep on
the ground, offers symbolism that
keeps the viewer in thought (that
life, perhaps, isn’t forever). Take
advantage of this low-light oppor-
tunity to exploit the soft tone and
variants of gray to compose an art
photograph.
When clouds (and rain) abound, use
black-and-white (B&W) film or switch
your digital camera into B&W mode.
Read all about B&W photography,
including ways to tweak your gray
shades with sliders in Photoshop’s
Channel Mixer layer. (Choose Layer➪
New Adjustment Layer➪Channel
Mixer; then select the monochrome
option.) Read more about that in Chapter 9.
For images shot in color that you took in bad weather, try converting them
to B&W. You just might be surprised by the results.
353

Figure 20-3: B&W images bring focus to
symbolic subject matter.

354
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Create a Matching Background
Creating a natural-looking background for a picture is one of the first things
you’ll want to do as a digital photographer. Placing an object from one photo
onto a faux background can clean up pictures that have too much going on in
the background. Also, creating a background that has more contrast with the
subject/object can make your subject or object stand out because you select
your own background color, matching, muting, or enhancing it to get just the
effect you want. One way to get a matching background is to use the
Eyedropper tool to pick up another color from within the image.
Figure 20-4 shows a feathered image
that I set into a new background. It’s
a handy option you’ll probably want
to use. Here are the steps:
1. Select the image’s background
by using one of the Lasso tools
to select your object and then
choose Select➪Inverse.
2. Set the feathering value by
choosing Select➪Feather and
then typing in a value in the
Feather Selection dialog box.
One or two pixels is generally
sufficient.
3. Add a new solid color fill layer
by choosing Layer➪New Fill
Layer➪Solid Color and then
clicking OK in the New Layer
dialog box. 
4. With the Eyedropper tool, pick
a color and click around on
your subject/object until you
get the background color
match that you like.
You can duplicate any colorful image for a color study simply by choosing
Image➪Duplicate. You can make color study sets by changing one or two
colors in the image to a different hue and/or saturation. You can change any
color by tweaking the shades combined within them by adding a Hue Saturation
Adjustment layer in Photoshop (Layer➪Adjustment Layer➪Hue/Saturation).
For more about this option, see Chapter 12. Pair ’em up, and you’ve got an
artsy set ready to go. (Bonus Chapter 1 on the book’s companion Web site —
www.dummies.com/go/digitalartphotos — has more information about
photo sets.)
Figure 20-4: The background color of this lamp
is a color contained within it.

Playing with the selection tools can be a bit tricky (just about all the cool
Photoshop techniques require that
you first select something), but
here’s a hint that’ll help: Press
Option (Mac)/Ctrl (Windows) while
you drag to take away from a selec-
tion area and press Shift while you
drag to add to a selection.
Meld Layers to 
Create Motion
After you download or scan an
image from film into Photoshop,
you can multiply items within your
image by selecting them, copying
them, and pasting them into new
layers over and over again, making
a hundred layers if you want. By
repeating copying and pasting,
you can get parts of your image
to move like an old-fashioned 
flip-book. The Go crosswalk man
inside the stop light comes to life
in Figure 20-5.
Build Your Archive of Backgrounds
Having a variety of backgrounds can help you
clean up your images if they need it. Sometimes
you can’t avoid clutter or distractions in the
background of an image with a really good sub-
ject. In many of my pictures of signs, that’s
exactly the case. When this happens, I take the
image and feather it into one of my blue sky back-
grounds, as shown in Figure 20-6.
Take a picture of a blue sky, focusing on some-
thing small, like a plane. After you download that
image, remove the plane using the Stamp tool.
Voilá! A beautiful, unblemished sky to use as a
background should a cluttered image need it.
355

Figure 20-5: Layering objects can make them
move.
Figure 20-6: Clutter-free back-
grounds have aesthetic appeal.

356
Part V: The Part of Tens 
No Photoshop tool can create a totally natural-
looking sky (or clouds). People are smart: It’s
like a sixth sense. Create a fake sky, and they’ll
know. A real sky has dozens of shades of blue
that vary according to where the sun is with
respect to the shot. I’ve tried time and time
again to reproduce this by painting my back-
grounds blue using the Paint Bucket tool
and selecting a sky blue color from the Color
Picker. Although some shots of these one-tone,
sometimes blazing-blue backgrounds have been
effective, most have not.
Sometimes an image that you file as a potential
background file is so beautiful that the image in
and of itself will sell, like Figure 20-7.
Don’t Overdo Effect(s)
Pixilation happens when not enough data is in your file — so when you expand
the image, it grabs from the nearest pixel and replicates it to fill the space.
What you get with pixilation is noise.
When you perform an action in
Photoshop — say, with a filter —
the program shuffles data dropping
and adding pixels to get the effect
you want. When you perform the
action once, you won’t notice
much difference in your image,
and you also get the effect you want.
Do the action over and over again,
though, and Photoshop reshuffles
pixels so much that your image
begins to look noisy.
Too much of Photoshop CS2’s Smart
Sharpen filter will also let you view
the paper fiber from a scanned digi-
tal print. A furry rodent scanned
from a glossy print and then run
through the Smart Sharpen filter
can produce the result shown in
Figure 20-8.
Figure 20-7: Print simple images
as is.
Figure 20-8: Too much sharpening can show
the paper fiber of a scanned print.

Use the Edit➪Fade Command
If you end up with noise after giving your image
all the tweaks you think it needs, you can use
Edit➪Fade to reduce your changes, bit by bit (see
Figure 20-9). Use the slider to take you back to
where you started or within any percentage of
the change that you requested in an action.
Changing the blending mode can also have an
incredible effect on a filter or adjustment.
If you want to undo the last thing you’ve done, use the Edit➪Undo command.
If you decide you want it back (that’s anything you do from selections to
using tools and filters), choose Edit➪Redo after you undo what you did.
Keep Your Image in High Res on All Platforms
If you start out with an image that’s 8" x 10" and 300 pixels per inch (ppi), you
want to finish at the same size and resolution (res) — if that’s the size you plan
on printing. I scanned the photo in Figure 20-10 at 300 ppi from a negative.
(The scanner was set to that resolution before the scanning process began. For
more on scanning, see Chapter 3.) I then imported the image into Photoshop
at the same resolution via the scanner software, saving it in Photoshop at
300 ppi resolution. Each time the image is printed, I use 2880 dots per inch
(dpi), which is a value that ensures I get the most bang for my buck from
what Photoshop doles out at 300 ppi.
Figure 20-10: A high-res image should stay that way from start to finish.

Telling (And Selling) a Story 
Using Photo Sets
In This Chapter
 Creating a photo set
 Classifying your photos
 Preparing photo sets to sell in galleries or shops
E
veryone likes collecting stuff (well, most everyone). Just visit any
museum, and you’ll find a collection of something. In fact, art museums
call a series of related works collections! As an art photographer, you can
become a de facto mini-curator, presenting your own custom collections that
collectors will covet. (Kind of circular, isn’t it?)
Remember that every photo tells a story. As a photographer,
you are the storyteller — or in the case of photojournalism,
the reporter. Use a photo set — a collection of related
photos — as a marketing tool for your work and to tell
stories. The common themes are endless, from color
extravaganzas to a common subject to timelines.
Perhaps you want to show a progression of events,
like how quickly a newborn transforms to a toddler,
or a bridge being built. You can also use a photo set
to capture a series of related items or emotions, like
a set that shows the different rides of an amusement
park or a rainbow of young people in love.
Although you can shoot with a planned photo set in mind,
don’t overlook the opportunity to harvest a photo set from
the images you already have in your collection — the story that
you can eventually tell isn’t always obvious while you are photographing
dissimilar things. Sometimes the connecting theme appears later as a serendip-
itous surprise.

B2
Digital Art Photography For Dummies 
And don’t forget the positive business aspects of selling photo sets: Offering
a sequence of photographs is good business because many times people will
buy the whole set instead of one — thus, you are building a product whereby
people buy in multiples.
Selling a story using your photographs can encompass more than just your
image. It can include the history of your community with documentation of
its recent or historical development.
Crafting a Photo Set from a Storyboard
If you’re a bit lost at first when designing a photo set — or need help keeping
your creative focus on track — here’s a very simple but effective tool you can
use: a storyboard. Think of the basic panel progression technique used in comic
book drawing or scripting a movie or TV show. A storyboard is nothing more
than a progression of scenes, usually sequential (although your set doesn’t
have to follow a timeline). Your storyboard is your map. A sample storyboard
of a sequence of shots in a grocery store is shown in Figure BC1-1.
Art credit: Storyboard drawing by Ramiro Ortega
Figure BC1-1: Sketch a storyboard to help you plan your shots.
When you photograph any scene, keep photo sets in mind — shoot long,
medium length, and close up. Keep these concepts in mind as you put
together a batch of art into a set.
1. Identify the types of shots you want to use for your photo set.
For example, lay out a story using an establishing shot, medium shots,
and close-ups.

• Beginning: This is the establishing shot that tells you where you
are — kind of like the setting of a novel. An establishing shot is
usually a long shot: That is, it has great depth of field and is clear
throughout. (For more on depth of field, see Chapter 5.)
A landscape photo can be an excellent establishing shot. In the
movies or on television, this kind of shot often opens the show.
• Middle: This is a medium length shot, used to pique the viewer’s
curiosity. It should show some detail to give the viewer knowledge
of the character’s surroundings.
• End: This is a close-up that announces the finale and also gives 
closure. On a dSLR, I like to use portrait mode and shoot with a 
traditional blurred background. For more on portrait mode, see
Chapter 5.
2. Decide how many photos to include in the set.
How many depends on the number the gallery or store can fit in their
space. You have to size up where you want to sell to determine how many
photos you’re going to put out there. One thing is for sure, though — if
you have a popular and abundant photo set, keep updating them with
new images. I have nearly 1000 mid-century motel sign images that I con-
stantly update and upgrade, so people can collect as many as they want.
3. Decide whether to include text and how you will do that.
Adding text to your artwork has become much more common since the
1960s when artists such as Andy Warhol experimented with using mes-
sages about social behavior with his images. More about that in the
“Text” section, later in this chapter.
Following your storyboard guideline, your shots fall into place, as in Figure
BC1-2.
Two main types of storyboard are
 Sequential: A series of images that tell a story. An example of sequential
actions shots could be a boy on a playground swinging and then jump-
ing off, as in Figure BC1-5 in the upcoming section, “Timelines.”
 Topical: A series of images that explains how you do something.
Mundane as this might seem, take an everyday activity such as brushing
your teeth and make a photo set out of it by showing the pictures of the
steps to do it.

Figure BC1-2: A photo set tells a story.

Classifying Your Shots
You don’t have to follow the path of a storyboard, though. Think about how
other people present collections, remembering times when you’ve visited
a museum or a gallery. You move through a museum or gallery following a
preset direction, eyeing pieces that are displayed in a deliberate fashion by
the curators and owners. These folks pick the images and purposely decide
where to place a piece in terms of where patrons will look and what they’ll
see when they stop to look. Simply, you follow a set — a collection.
To see how some exhibits are curated at museums, see www.metmuseum.org
or visit some local galleries.
You make the choices to define a collection of images and how to group them,
just as a curator does. You are, in fact, a curator of your own exhibit. And as
curator, you have many options for defining a set:
 Related subject
 Theme/emotion
 Color
 Black and white (B&W)
 Timelines
 Panoramas
 Composition
 Patterns
 Media
Your digital camera photo software can display photos on your computer
screen so that you can see them within a matrix that lets you zoom in and
out. Review your images regularly. This can give you a sense of where you
want to go in terms of subject matter. Any of these photo set groupings can
spark your imagination to help you name your photo sets.
Having a name for a set enables you to communicate the idea of your project
to store/gallery owners and museum curators both online and in person.
You can also develop a pitch — that is, a quick one-sentence or -paragraph
description of what your set contains.
Keep your end audience in mind. For example, an industrial-looking photo
series is appropriate for an office.

Related subjects
Similar subjects are natural in a collection.
For example, if you like to photograph
collies, a collection of shots showing
them at work, play, and sleep is perfect
for those Lassie lovers. Speaking of col-
lies, don’t forget to look for twists of 
differences among similar things. For
example, consider a collection of shots
of border collies — true, they’re all the
same thing, but because all border collies
are marked differently, you have a same-
but-different collection. The same premise
holds true when photographing a collec-
tion of different puppy breeds — you’re
showcasing puppies (great “aahh” factor),
but they’re all different — or even old-
time radios, as shown in Figure BC1-3.
Two or more of anything in each photo of
a set adds dimension. It also gives you a
natural name for your set for a show.
And don’t forget that collection of pho-
tographs of pricey objets d’art is a great
way for a collector — and potential buyer
of your photos — to afford adding to
their collection of their fancy. For more
on shooting objets d’art, see Chapter 4.
Photographs of historical items sell.
Black and white
Using all B&W shots can really show your stuff as an art photographer. You can
highlight common subject matter, shadows, lighting, or patterns. For more on
B&W photography, see Chapter 9.
Color
Grouping a photo set by color is a natural eye-catcher. You can group like
items by colors (a set of different purple-toned flowers) or show a progres-
sion of colors (a four-shot, per-season series of the same nature scene).
Figure BC1-4 shows a photo set of purple flowers, selected for their color.

subtle differences.

Composition
Repeating compositional elements creates cohesion in a collection. You
can shoot a series of any similar geometric shape, such as lines, circles,
or triangles.
Timelines
Use a sequential series of shots to umbrella an event. This could be as dra-
matic as a horse race or as everyday as a child on a swing (see Figure BC1-5).
See the earlier section, “Crafting a Photo Set from a Storyboard,” for how to
use a storyboard as a map to create a timeline.
Figure BC1-5: A sequence of shots makes for interesting art.
Patterns
Repeating pattern elements is also an easy way to create a collection. Look
for checkerboards (think patios and tile floors), swirls (an eddy of water, a
drain, or a giant lollipop), and woven items (close-ups of baskets, knit or cro-
cheted items, or wicker furniture).
Pattern repetition also gives motion to your photos, letting the eye follow
similar objects, each that tell a story. Any repeating pattern from geometric
to free forms stimulates the brain to continue the pattern it sees well beyond
the photograph itself.

Keep the background pattern in mind when shooting for a photo set. See pit-
falls to avoid in the upcoming section on polishing your images in an image
editing program.
Media
The final print is what it’s all about. Presenting your set on a similar type of
media — photographic paper, vinyl, fabric — ties them together. Or (being
the artsy kind of person you are) take the same shot and present it on differ-
ent types of media for a together-but-contrasting look.
Theme/emotion
A common theme (like birthday parties for your budding child) or emotion
(like older couples holding hands) is also a natural collection. You can build a
theme on anything, tailoring it for niche stores and boutiques where you live.
For example, in the Midwest, you might be able to market a photo set of fair
or carnival scenes (see Figure BC1-6).

Historical perspective
Time passes, and people and places change. Keeping track of it all can be
overwhelming. Not very many people keep track of what was where, when in
your community. Sure, there’s probably a historical society somewhere, but
they deal with really old things.
You can showcase such a historical perspective by creating a photo set with
a reverse timeline, using shots of people or architecture from the past of the
same subject. Search your archives to find interesting shots that you’ve taken
(or people have taken of you) 5, 10, 15, 20, and even 50 years ago. If the sub-
ject still exists, take a photo of it as it appears today. You become a historian
of sorts.
Archiving and Storing Your Shots
Be a curator for your own images. Keep your files organized by folders or within
a photo cataloging application like iPhoto or Adobe Album. I file mine in folders
using categories such as architecture, animals, landscapes, people, sculpture,
objets d’art, and signs. Remember, too, that such programs enable you to assign
keywords (words and phrases added to the image files) and perhaps categories.
Later you can search by keyword to find all the images to which you have
assigned to it. Keywords and categories are wonderful for not just organizing,
but for locating specific images — even if you don’t remember the file name,
the date taken, or even the specific content.
Of course, knowing which images to keep and which to throw away is the
trick. Toss weak shots while they’re in your camera. If you’re not sure, keep
them until you can look at them on your computer. Clean out your images
every week: Don’t let your sorting grow to the point where there are so many
images you don’t know what to do. Spend 15 minutes each day cleaning them
out so that the task isn’t so overwhelming that you give up.
You can’t find the images you want if you don’t know where they are. Keeping
images that fit into categories helps when you search for the one you want.
Preparing a Set of Prints for Sale
After you have a set of photos, you need to prepare them for presentation
and sale. Factor in size, printing/media, judicious use of text, framing/matting,
and pricing.

Size
Size is an important consideration when crafting a photo set. Choose appro-
priate print sizes and offer choices. For example, you might choose a smaller
print size (say a series of 3" x 5"s) for objets d’art. For a panoramic cut series,
consider a strong horizontal print size — say, 8" x 4". The repeated shapes
bring cohesion.
Of course, you could vary the sizes
but retain similar shapes, which
makes for interesting combinations
when displaying. For example, use
two rectangles of different sizes
and two squares, as shown in
Figure BC1-7.
When thinking about size to make
the images in your photo set,
remember to keep your buyer in
mind. Larger images cost more to
produce, and thus are pricier.
Printing/polishing in an image editing program
Before you fire up the old printer, you’ll want to make sure that each photo
for your set is consistent in tone and contrast, and that the background in
each is not distracting. (This is something to look out for as you shoot, too,
so that you have less tweaking to do in this later stage.)
People do look at backgrounds — you have to be careful that they don’t 
interfere with your primary objects in your foregrounds. A background that
complements your computer desktop computer can’t be so evasive as to
interrupt your view of the icons on your screen. The same thing goes for 
photography.
You can copy and paste thousands of backgrounds into your photo in
Photoshop so that you tweak the individual photos in a set to present
them with a unified look.
Web sites such as http://market.renderosity.com sell high-resolution
studio background images for about $8 per image.
For more on high-quality printing, see Chapter 17. For more on tweaking your
image for contrast and tone, see Chapter 12.

You can photograph any object and make up a story about it and include it

mously popular series of comic book-like characters — colorful characters
made out of small dots each saying something in text. For more about adding
text to an image in Photoshop, see Bonus Chapter 2.
Figure BC1-8 shows a similar concept using portraits that were originally
whole body figures stenciled on a wall in Europe.

Framing/matting
Your framing choice adds to the cohesion of your photo set. Classic sleek
black framing lends strength to architectural shots; aged barnwood is appro-
priate for rustic shots; brightly painted colors are suitable for a child’s theme.
Likewise, matting can add an air of sophistication or whimsy. See Chapter 18
for great sources on your framing and matting needs.

Check local stores and galleries to see what photo sets sell for in your com-
munity. You can also search online for pricing parameters.

avemen drew pictograms — word pictures that represent ideas — on
walls. Ancient civilizations chiseled hieroglyphics on tablets using small
tools. Early printing presses clacked and clattered, slapping ink on heavy
vellum paper to combine text with pictures. The history of communicating
with text and art obviously goes back a long time.
As the use of text for communication grew, so did font families, which
are typefaces classified according to style, line thickness,
and strokes. The old Roman type lettering changed when
people invented new styles, and then new categories of
typefaces (computer-generated) appeared when people
wanted more new versions of old styles as well as
brand new looks.
Today, you can use all kinds of applications, even
Microsoft Word, to communicate thoughts via
words. You can easily place text into your document
by entering text within an image in Photoshop or
creating an image file that can be copied and pasted
into Word. And text in Word and text in Photoshop are
interchangeable: Just copy from Word to Photoshop by
using the Copy and Paste commands in both programs.
And create with not just words alone but also words com-
bined with an image (or sometimes hundreds of images), each
layered on top of another and processed to create anything from the 
signage on buildings to the final credit of your favorite movie.

The marriage of text and the visual image is a natural one — over the years, this
marriage has become more and more appealing as technology progresses.
You can work with text from Word or (any place else for that matter) as well
as create text right in Photoshop using cool tools to make your text become
part of your artwork, which is just what this chapter is all about. So, incorpo-
rate text into your visual arts and create matrimony that’s sure to woo your
viewer into opening his pocketbook to purchase your work.
Fonts 101
When you create your own effective art pieces that combine text and photos,
remember to keep the following design fundamentals in mind. Look at ads,
billboards, and signage to see what’s effective as well as eye-catching. After
these examples, you can read about fonts and how you can manipulate them
to help you make your design choices.
 Color: Text among matching background colors is a draw. In Figure BC2-1,
eye-catching (because of their color) bills are effective when shown in
numbers.
 Balance: Take care to balance not only how the text is placed but also the
text style that you use for a visually appealing work of art. In Figure BC2-1,
note that only sans serif fonts (fonts without the little flourishes at the
ends of each stroke) are used. (For the rebel in you, read about mixing
fonts in the upcoming section, “Mixing fonts.”) You can break the rules
anytime; it just depends what’s in your picture and what looks good to
you and a couple of aesthetically astute pals. Aside from that, many
businesses mix fonts all the time, so your choices are many.
If you’re going to do the font mix, start with mixing Century Old Style
with ITC Franklin Gothic Heavy or Franklin Gothic with Futura Light or
Century Old Style.
 Display: Although not truly part of the art design process, keep in mind
how your work will be displayed. Of course a single instance of your art —
such as an individual poster — should be appealing, but you can also
design with the actual utilization in mind. Take, for example, Figure BC2-2.
Knowing that a poster will be displayed in repetition enables you to
include more information than an individual might be expected to com-
prehend when seeing a single poster while walking or driving past.

Words in art can play, dance and even send subliminal messages — a powerful
tool made even more powerful with the fairly new process of image process-
ing and text manipulation.

where they’re posted.

Figure BC2-2: Getting a message across sometimes means 
saying it twice (or more).
When you choose text to use in tandem with your art, you want to make sure
that it’s complementary and appropriate. That includes choosing the font
itself as well as its size and any special treatment, such as italic, condensed,
light, or bold. To help you make your decisions, you need a little background
on the factors that help define a font and its look.
Serif and sans serif
Font families are divided into two main categories: serif and sans serif:
 serif: A serif font is one that includes “handles” as part of the text,
like the font used for this sentence. Serif fonts are generally used for
small type that’s closely spaced, such as the body text of a book or 
magazine. The serifs at the ends of the character strokes make the 
letters more recognizable in close quarters, making it easier to read
such type. When using a serif font in a design project or as part of
your artwork, it will generally convey such concepts as solid, establish-
ment, elegant, and perhaps conservative (depending on the subject or
concept).

 sans serif: Sans serif (literally without serif) fonts don’t include the little
flourishes at the end of the strokes. Sans serif fonts are typically used
more for headlines and large type. Helvetica (shown in this sentence) is
an example of a sans serif font. Sans serif fonts come in a wide variety
of styles, some of which are quite business-like and others that are fun,
flirty, flamboyant, and even rather fantastic.
Font styles
You know the old standby fonts, Times New Roman (what this text looks like)
and Helvetica. You probably use them most every day if you have a computer.
These are the traditional, steadfast, and dependable fonts that move from
the Internet to your cell phone and PDA. However, don’t forget about some
of the other fonts — the fonts that both Word and Photoshop offer as well as
those that open a world of possibilities as you add graphic design to your art
repertoire.
There are dozens of places to get fonts on the Internet, both for free and for
a price. As a matter of fact, I obtained the font I used in the pool party invite
(in the “Using fonts effectively” section, later in this chapter) for free at
free-font-downloads.com. Here are some other places to get fonts:
 www.housind.com: The hippest fonts — that look as if they came from
The Jetsons television show — will cost you. They’re smooth and beautiful,
tooled like a BMW; use them to write words like Astroman and anything-
a-rama. You can try ’em out right at the site. The kits cost around $150.
 www.fonts.com: If you’re looking for fonts that will appeal to kids to use
in your art work, this site is the place for you. It even offers an insect font.
A font that looks hand-drawn is a good choice because you can’t really
get that effect in Word or Photoshop — and if you try to do it yourself
with a mouse (which is like drawing with a bar of soap), you get mouse
shake. At this site, you can pick up Skippy Sharp (among hundreds of
others), a hand-drawn font, for just $22.
 1001fonts.com: This site (unlike many other font sites that make you
hunt for the advertised freebies) puts its free fonts right on the first page.
A really nice one is a Disney-esque font called Waltograph, which would
be a great addition for any type of fireworks photos that you have, not to
mention lady-like dragon flies named Tinkerbell. Users can submit fonts
(which are pretty good) for people to use as freeware (which you can
download for free).

Digital Art Photography For Dummies 
To see how to create your own custom text, see the later section “Making Art
out of Text.”
Font size
When planning your text, know what options are available in Photoshop or
whatever text processor you’re using. This way, you can adjust your fonts so
that they fit within your image and among the other characters in your text.
By default, you set your font size by points (pt) although you can also use
pixels in Photoshop. Points are the traditional measurement of font size,
equal to 1⁄72 of an inch (generally
speaking). When working with fonts
in Photoshop, you’ll see that the
Options bar and the Character
palette provide some preset font
sizes. Don’t think that you’re
restricted to just those sizes! With
Photoshop’s Type tool active, you
can size your font however you
like — simply type the font size in
the Font Size field. You can also click
directly on the double-T symbol to
the left of the Font Size field, hold
down the mouse button, and drag
left or right to resize selected text.
As you can see in Figure BC2-3, you
can also use the Character palette
to scale the font, changing its hor-
izontal or vertical proportions 
independently.
Font color
The color that you choose for your font also helps convey the message you
want for your art piece. Obviously, black is traditional and businesslike, red
implies urgency, blue is trustworthy and calm, and so on. Keep in mind the
background of your finished piece when choosing font color — just because
you like a particular color doesn’t mean that your font will be readable or
clear.
Figure BC2-3: Make fonts huge by changing
values here.

In Word, you can choose font color from the Formatting toolbar. Just open
the drop-down Font Color palette and click the color you want. In Photoshop,
you can choose font color by clicking the Type tool and then clicking the Set
the Text Color option (a color-filled rectangle at the Options bar or within
the Character palette), after which a Color Picker dialog box comes up for
you to make your choices. You can also pick font color after you write your
text by selecting the font layer and then selecting a color in the Character
palette.
Mixing fonts
Good (standard) design rules dictate that you use only one or two fonts to a
page in an ad or image. You don’t want to make your viewer overwhelmed
looking at just the text and fonts, and you certainly want your image, mes-
sage, and text styles to flow together as one unit. More conservative design
rules state that you shouldn’t mix sans serif with serif fonts on the same
page (or over, under, or on top of the same image), but in the anything-goes
atmosphere of graphic design these days, mixing the two seems to be more
common.
You can also, in effect, mix fonts by varying the style of the same font: that is,
using bold, italic, and/or fat, skinny, tall, or small characters.
Keeping in mind font styles and how they relate to your picture and each
other will help you to produce a fine art piece. Mixing and matching fonts 
is a creative process and one that can be an experiment — a trial-and-error
process of trying the different typefaces (or fonts) to create something that
appeals to you and others with the same sense of style.
Using fonts effectively
With hundreds of fonts to choose from and to use with an image, picking the
right one can be daunting — but it can also be great fun. Just keep in mind
the message you want to convey and emphasize.
In a sympathy card, for example, an elegant script font does justice to a sad
event (Figure BC2-4). In contrast, a more light-hearted font can dress up a
pool party invitation (see Figure BC2-5).

Creating and Tweaking Text
You can create and then tweak text in Word and Photoshop. Both offer choices
for font, font size and color, and various formatting treatments, such as bold,
italic, and so on. Word additionally offers WordArt options, which you can
use to create 3-D text.
You can always run a spell check in Word to catch most typos and mis-
spellings. Just click the Spelling and Grammar icon on the Standard toolbar.
In Photoshop, select the type layer in the Layers palette and use the menu
command Edit➪Check Spelling.

Text in Word
To create text in Word, simply open a new document, choose your font and
size, enter the text, apply the formatting you want, and save. It’s just that easy.
You choose your font, size, color, and any formatting from the Format toolbar:
 Font: Choose this from the Font drop-down menu.
 Font size: Choose this from the Font Size drop-down menu.
 Font color: Choose this from the Font Color drop-down palette.
 Formatting: Click the appropriate icon (B for bold, I for italic) on
the Formatting toolbar.
You can also create a background (other than white) for your text in word by
choosing Format➪Background and choosing a fill color in the dialog box that
appears. You can click and drag selected text over to Photoshop from Word
to include it with your images. Each time you click and drag, Photoshop cre-
ates a new layer for it. To see your layers, choose Window➪Layers.
Word includes a cool feature for
manipulating text: WordArt. Using
WordArt is a simple but effective way
to put text on top of a photo back-
ground. For example, I can take a
shot of black gravel and purposely
blur it to make it look like charcoal,
and then create WordArt to use in
the foreground that describes what I
put in the background — charcoal!
To add a little extra artistic flare, I
put a dash between each letter. See
Figure BC2-6.
Text in Photoshop
Clicking the Type tool puts Photoshop into text mode. In this mode, you can
directly type onto an image, without passing go or collecting $200. You click
the Type tool in your image to add “point type”(like newspaper headlines) or
drag the tool to add paragraph type (like the columns of text in a newspaper).
One of the most important aspects of type in Photoshop is that it’s re-editable.
Sure, that may sound like an “Of course!” feature, but it hasn’t always been
that way. (Remember that Photoshop is an image editing program, not a word
Figure BC2-6: You can make art with text.

processor.) Unless and until you flatten your image or elect to rasterize the
type layer (perhaps to use Photoshop’s advanced warping capability), you
can go back and make changes to the text on the type layer. Even after spe-
cial effects have been applied! However, keep in mind that once you merge
layers or flatten your image, you can’t select and edit the text. For more
about layers, see Chapter 14.
After selecting the Text tool, you can customize the following options:
 Font: Choose this from the Set the Font Family drop-down menu in the
Options bar or from the Character palette.
 Font size: Choose this from the Set the Font Size drop-down menu in the
Options bar or from the Character palette.
Font size presets only go up to 72 points in Photoshop’s Options bar. To
use larger text, simply type a number in the Font Size field.
 Font color: Click the color swatch in the Options bar to open the Color
Picker and then use the Set the Text Color option in the Options bar or
from the Character palette.
 Font Style: Choose this from the Set the Font Style drop-down menu in
the Options bar or from the Character palette.
 Anti-Aliasing: Choose this from the Set the Font Style drop-down menu
in the Options bar. This option removes jagged edges. Photoshop offers
a couple of choices when it takes away the jag — sharp, crisp, strong
and smooth.
Photoshop places text in a new layer each time you click an area of the
screen with the Type tool. (Click too close to text on an existing type layer,
and you’ll be editing that text rather than creating a new type layer.)
You can change the background color (from white) of your text in a new doc-
ument (File➪New). In preparation for adding new text in Photoshop, click the
foreground color swatch at the bottom of the Tools palette to open the Color
Picker and select a color you like for your image’s background. Then click
the Paint Bucket tool in the Tools palette and click on your work area with it.
That fills the layer (your image background) with the selected color (your
foreground color).
You can add a new background with one action by adding a new fill layer
(choose Layer➪New Fill Layer➪Solid Color) and picking a color from the
Color Picker dialog box.

the later sections, “Creating an Ad with Text and a Photo” and “Making Art

Tweaking text to make it readable
No matter whether you create your text in Word or Photoshop, after you choose
an appropriate font and decide its color and style and height, you have a few
layout options to tinker with — like leading, kerning, and tracking — to make
the text appear as you want on your composite project.
 Leading: Leading (pronounced led-ding, as in the metal lead) is the amount
of space between lines (see Figure BC2-7). Not enough leading is the cul-
prit when you see a line of text on top of another. For optimal legibility,
set leading values a bit larger then font size.
• Word: Choose Format➪Paragraph. On the Indents and Spacing tab,
adjust the Spacing (Before and After) options.
• Photoshop: Click the Type tool and then access the Character
palette by clicking Toggle the Character and Paragraph Palettes.
After the Character palette comes up, type in a value larger than
your font size to get proper spacing between lines. 120% is usually
a good choice.
 Kerning: Kerning is setting the distance between each character.
• Word: Choose Format➪Font. Click the Character Spacing tab and
then tweak the Spacing and By options there.
• Photoshop: You can adjust this value by adjusting the values in
the upper right of the Character palette (refer to figure BC2-3).
When you kern, you select the space between two letters only.
Kerning affects the letter to the right of where you click in the
text with the Type tool. After you set your cursor between two 
letters, kerning with positive values pushes the entire letter set
to the right of your text to make extra room for the extra space
you want between two letters. When you set negative values, all
letters to the right get pushed to the left so that there is less space
between the letter pair you are kerning.

 Tracking: Tracking is the option to the right of the kerning settings. First
select the text to be amended, and the space between all your letters
that you select changes according to the values you choose.
Figure BC2-7: Use adequate leading.
Marrying Text and Photos
Time to tie the knot, so to speak. Take your font and text-tweaking prowess
and combine them with a great photo for projects that are fun and effective.
Think greeting cards, think invitations, think ads . . . your creativity is the limit.
Of course, text overlaid on a photo doesn’t serve any purpose if you can’t
read it. You have to consider both placement as well as what color type you
choose. Contrast between foreground text and a background image creates
depth in your final product and makes the text easy to read. You have to follow
just two rules when placing text over a background (see Figure BC2-8 to see
what I mean):
 Overlay light-colored text on a dark background. White text on a back-
ground of darker shades of gray and black has a nighttime effect.
 Overlay dark-colored text on a light background. Black text on a white
background is very traditional (and readable). However, you can vary
from light shades of gray as a background to dark shades of gray for
your text.

Creating an Ad with 
Text and a Photo
Everybody loves a pooch. Making a
good ad or party invite with an
animal as the superstar involves a
photogenic pooch and the finesse of
Photoshop layers — not to mention
how well you compose and shoot the photo, and, of course, how you compose
the text with respect to the picture. With a bit of luck (getting the pooch to
cooperate), you can have your pet saying something great in a well-composed
photo where the dog is looking nothing less than fabulous. Just follow these
steps:
1. In Photoshop, open an image.
Figure BC2-10 shows the image I’m using for this example.
The image comes up as a locked Background layer.
2. To unlock the photo layer so that you can move it around in your art-
work, double-click the layer name Background in the Layers palette
and rename the layer.
3. Choose Image➪Canvas Size and adjust your canvas so that you have
enough width and/or height for both your subject and the text.
4. Add a new layer below your original image layer by Command+clicking
(Mac) or Ctrl+clicking (PC) on the New Layer button at the bottom of
the Layers palette.
5. Choose Edit➪Fill to fill the lower layer with the color of your choice.
6. Select the Magnetic Lasso tool from the Toolbox and select the Anti-
Aliasing check box in the Options bar.
7. Make sure that the upper layer (your original image layer) is active by
clicking it in the Layers palette.

Making Art out of Text
If you’re game to stretch beyond premade fonts — that is, draw the text your-
self with your mouse for a less-mechanical look — you can create your own
text style. It just takes a little planning. Remember that a character is just an
element to which you can apply many tweaks in Photoshop.
In this example, the text The Bug contains six characters and a space in
between, offering a myriad of opportunities for art. Of course, your projects
will, too. For this example, I use a photo of a VW bug. For a hybrid auto,
you could use the words Gas Saver. For a Jaguar, you could use The Cat.
(A graphics tablet [see Chapter 3] is ideal for this kind of task.)
1. Start with a picture.
For this example, I use a shot of a favorite car, as shown in 
Figure BC2-14.
Figure BC2-14: Start out with a picture.
2. Choose View➪Show➪Grid.
This puts a grid over your image so
that you can plan out your text in rela-
tion to the photo (see Figure BC2-15).
Also check to make sure that the
option View➪Snap To➪Grid is not
selected.
Figure BC2-15: A grid helps you write
your text with the Pen tool.

3. Add a new layer on which to draw.
Click the New layer button at the bottom of the Layers palette to add a
new empty layer. This permits you to experiment without ruining your
original image.
4. Using the Brush tool, draw
your text over the grid on the
layer copy (see Figure BC2-16).
In the Options bar, you want to
select a brush tip size and hard-
ness (generally about 90% for
this sort of work) as well as a
color. So that the letters can be
filled with color later, make sure
that each is a closed path —
don’t leave any gaps in your 
outlines.
5. Make a selection of the interior
of each letter.
Select the Magic Wand tool from the Toolbox and choose the Contiguous
option from the Options bar. Hold down the Shift key on your keyboard
and click inside each of the letters. The goal is to make a selection of
everything that would be color if these were letters created with the
Type tool. (Don’t, for example, click in the areas that would create the
holes in the letter B.) If you see that suddenly the entire layer is selected,
you’ve found a gap in one of your outlines. Deselect (Ô/Ctrl+D), repair
the outline, select again.
6. Add a new layer.
With your selection still active, click the New Layer button at the bottom
of the Layers palette.
7. Fill the selection with color, a pattern, or a gradient and adjust the
layer’s blending mode and opacity.
Choose Edit➪Fill to add color or a pattern to the body of your letters,
and then experiment with the layer blending modes and opacity at the
top of the Layers palette. Use a blending mode that enables your letters
to interact with the photo below.
8. (Optional) Choose Image➪Adjustment➪Gradient Map, as shown in
Figure BC2-17.
This randomly colorizes your image, making it Warhol-like.

9. Stroke each letter.
Make sure that the layer with
the body of your text is active in
the Layers palette and apply a
rather large Stripe layer effect.
For this example, I use white as
the color and 29 pixels for the
stroke width (see Figure BC2-18).
10. Delete your work layer.
In the Layers palette, drag the
layer on which you originally
created your letter outlines to
the trash.
11. Make a selection of the empty background.
Make sure that your text layer is active in the Layers palette by clicking it.
Select the Magic Wand tool. In the Options bar, deselect the Contiguous
option. Click once in the empty area of the layer.
12. Add a new layer.
13. Fill the selection with color.
Select a complementary color and fill the area, hiding the bottom
layer except where the letters appear. The final version is shown in
Figure BC2-19.

Putting the “Art” in Digital Art Photography
 Don’t be afraid to take photos on cloudy and/or rainy days (Chapter 5).
 Always carry your camera with you so when you see something unusual, you can
snap a picture of it (Chapter 4).
 Use layers to merge several images to create an entirely new and different image
(Chapter 14).
 Use a filter when shooting during the day to offset the sun’s glare and to make a better
picture (Chapter 11).
 Study and emulate the work of famous photographers to train your eye but then
develop your own style (Chapter 9).
 For action shots, set your camera beforehand, get as close as you can to your subject,
and keep your f-stop low (Chapter 7).
 Study the rules of photography and then break them to attain certain effects (Chapters
6 and 8).
 Snap several pictures of a landscape or something tall, like the Tiki shown here, and
then merge the pieces to re-create the whole (Chapter 13).
 Experiment, experiment, experiment — whether you’re out taking pictures or sitting at
home fiddling in Photoshop, don’t be afraid to try something new.
Color Temperature Changes with Respect to Light Source
Knowing a little bit about color temperature can help you get optimum color results. Different light sources
emit light at different color temperatures, causing your picture to lean either to a red or blue hue. As
shown in this table, a high color temperature shifts light toward blue, and a low color temperature shifts
light toward red hues. See Chapter 8 for more about color temperature and getting great color shots.
