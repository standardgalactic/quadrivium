 Foreword 
 You have in your hands a brilliant and informative resource written by a true thought leader in our industry. 
Having had a prime seat at the table as an early navigator in the space, I’ve watched Stephen lead the way, 
and I’m deeply honored to be able to provide an introduction to what I hope will help propel you into the 
bright and promising future of the beacosystem. 
 It used to be the retailers themselves were changing the way retail was done—with deals and 
promotions, coupons, and e-mail blasts. Now, it’s the retail marketing and technology companies 
transforming how those retailers retail. Innovation, however, often comes in pockets, and you often have 
to throw a test against the wall to see what sticks. In the realm of location-based marketing, that can mean 
testing with beacons, sending targeted e-mail promotions, and engaging with customers both online and off. 
 Location-based marketing will be a $43.3 billion market by 2019, but the segment, which encompasses 
various channels to enable a brand to expand its reach, should not be confused with mobile advertising, 
which is only one part of a much larger marketing ecosystem that includes billboards, display advertising, 
and other channels. 
 So many retailers are bogged down with the bottom line and revenue that they forget about what drives 
the bottom line: customers and customer experience. Beacons are an important part of the wider location-
based solution set available to aid in achieving these goals. 
 At the Location Based Marketing Association (LBMA), we believe that retailers need to invest in and 
develop a strategy for deploying these solutions. We call this strategy a three-layer location cake. 
 It’s important to recognize that location-based marketing is really about recognizing location as a data 
set that spans many technologies, devices, and media types. 
 We all want to get to that top layer, the one with the icing and whip cream, the one that ultimately leads 
to transactions and revenue, but we can’t get there unless we drive the right customers to the store and 
create an experience that is engaging and rewarding for them. 
 Layer One: Driving Location-Based Traffic 
 The first layer of the location cake is about getting customers into the store. This comprises a series of 
technologies that include social media, push messaging, geo-fencing, and more. 
 Geo-fencing and social location platforms are among the exciting new technologies available to digital 
marketers: it’s a location-based service that sends content, messaging and promotions to smartphone or 
mobile device users who enter a certain geographic area. When smartphone users enter a geo-fence, they 
can potentially receive targeted ads on web sites or apps they visit on their mobile device. 
 You’ll also see in this book how beacons are being deployed in stores and being used to track back to 
the e-commerce sites of those brands. Effectively bridging the bricks and clicks worlds together. 
 After all, a beacon sitting in a store by itself is useless if you don’t have anybody there to talk to. 
 Layer Two: Driving Location-Based In-Store Engagement 
 Once you get the traffic into the building, you need to turn your attention to engagement. The second layer 
of the location cake is about increasing dwell time, basket size, and customer experience. It’s at this layer that 
you should invest in technologies like Wi-Fi and beacons. 

 ■ FOREWORD
xxiv
 Beacons are about connecting the offline to online experience. Perhaps a customer walks by an item, 
looks at it, but doesn’t buy. The store can later send them an e-mail about their shopping trip and remind 
them of items they passed over. Beacons also “listen” in on customer behavior, similar to how search engines 
are used to track browsing history and provide targeted online ads. 
 Beacons give retailers the ability to collect data—something they are missing out on with their brick-and-
mortar customers but are able to gather online. By engaging customers digitally in store, they can later use 
that data to re-engage them online—where more and more shoppers’ eyes and dollars are going these days. 
 It’s about being able to deliver that message in real-time, based on the context of where you are. It’s all 
about bringing that data into a single platform where you can act on it. 
 Beacons offer retailers a new way to connect with their customers, offering a more personalized, 
contextually based shopping experience. They not only deliver more value to the customers, but also 
empower your employees to consistently offer higher service levels.  
 Layer Three: Driving Location-Based Transactions 
 It’s been called a lot of things in retail: the “till,” the “cash box” or the “cash register.” In today’s digital age, the 
manual cash register has evolved into an electronic, scanning PoS (point-of-sale) system. 
 Whatever it’s called, the retail checkout system is based on the decades-old store design concept that 
consumers come to stores to choose their goods from shelves, and then pass through checkout to pay for 
what they purchased. Perhaps the greatest single disruption to the retail store is the fact that consumers have 
literally become the “point of sale.” They control where they shop, how they shop, how they pay, and where 
they receive their purchases. So, why do stores even need checkout lanes with “registers”? 
 The third layer of the location cake is focused on converting the great experience you’ve created 
with those customers into transactions and revenue. Here technologies like Apple Pay, near field 
communications (NFC), RFID, and loyalty platforms are key to winning the proximity-based transaction war. 
 Beacons play key role here too. Many of the early solutions work great as standalone mobile offer 
platforms, but without integration with the data you get from transactions and loyalty programs, those offers 
remain uninformed and often ineffective. 
 In  The Hitchhikers Guide to the Beacosystem, you will hear all about each of these technologies, 
including who is developing them, where best to use them, and how they can be applied. Read on and you 
will find real-world examples of their application in scenarios from all three layers of “The Cake”. 
 Having Your Cake and Eating It Too 
 It’s about the integration of people, places, and media. 
 Retailers must move on from the one off pilots in location technology and instead embrace a full-
fledged strategy that spans all three layers of the cake focused on driving traffic, creating engagement, and 
converting to revenue! 
 As a Canadian, I like to say we are still in the first half of the first period of the hockey game. There is 
much unexplored territory in the world of location-based marketing. This book goes a long way to helping 
the marketer, entrepreneur, and average consumer understand the value of location technology and data. 
The possibilities are endless and limited only by our imagination and ability to design and create.

 Founder and President, The Location Based Marketing Association

 Acknowledgments 
 First, let’s acknowledge you, the reader. I’m more grateful than I can say that you are actually reading the 
acknowledgements (I bet you read the credits at the movies too, am I right?) We’ve been thinking of you 
throughout the writing process and hope you have found the subject as interesting as we have and that you 
have embraced the rather rambling style we have adopted for the guide. Hopefully this book has armed you 
with enough facts and folklore that you feel qualified to create something new yourselves and to grow this 
beacosystem into something even more interesting. So, if you have been, thanks for reading. 
 One of the things that has made this volume special is that we managed to convince so many leaders 
of companies that are helping to develop the beacosystem to contribute chapters and talk about their 
respective areas of expertise. It’s not like you all have a shortage of things to do, and goodness knows you 
aren’t doing it for the money. So—Asif Khan, David Young, Ben Parker, Jarno Vanto, John Coombs, Kjartan 
Slette, Anke Audenaert, Phil Hendrix, Ray Rotolo, Patrick Leddy, Theresa Gordon, Mario Proietti, and Kris 
Kolodziej—thank you. 
 What’s in a name? Quite a lot, really. It set the whole tone and premise for this book as a survival 
guide for people who want to dive into this proximity tech space. We hope  The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the 
Beacosystem helps convey the magnitude of the subject and a sense of fun that is necessary for mental 
survival. Life is short, and you might as well enjoy learning. So thanks have to go to Douglas Adams, who first 
borrowed the Hitchhiker name from serious books about backpacking and provided hours of happy reading 
and listening to me as a kid. Thanks also to Sean O’Sullivan, who coined the “beacosystem” term, for letting 
us take it out for a spin and returning it with only a few bumps and scrapes, as well as for the pointers he 
has provided, both through his own writing and his suggestions on the book. Likewise, to Aisle Labs, who 
completely by coincidence adopted the Hitchhiker part of the name for their excellent report on beacons, 
which is available on their web site. Thanks for sharing. 
 This book originally started as a training course that we developed for our first-ever consulting client, 
Rick Belliotti, and his team at San Diego International Airport. SAN have gone on to create their own 
beacon-enabled app to help visitors navigate the terminals and track their baggage as they arrive at one of 
the world’s best airports. We look forward to writing about their app in the future. Don’t forget to buy a Good 
Traveler carbon offset as you are flying to or from San Diego. If it weren’t for Paul Manasjan, who gave me the 
consulting task of developing that non-profit program, we wouldn’t have been able to afford to pay the rent 
while taking the time to write this book. 
 Thanks to all of Statler Consulting’s clients. We learn through doing. It’s been a privilege to apply our 
knowledge to working on your challenges, be it talking with VCs and private equity firms about the best 
approach to investing in this space, working on business plans and patents for new ideas, or providing 
training to ramp up a team that is building new proximity services. 
 The experience that convinced me that there was an audience for our book was reprising the course 
that our friends at SAN airport had “piloted” and seeing it blossom up in Silicon Valley with beacon 
vendors, chip vendors, software experts, as well as venues in the audience. Thanks to Mario Tapia for the 
collaboration with Mobile Monday University to put that course on. 
 We learned a lot of the things that are in this book while working on wireless and retail technology 
issues at Qualcomm. Thanks to everyone there who was part of that journey. Thanks to Irwin and Paul 
Jacobs for creating a unique environment that valued creativity and engineering, to Brian Dunphy who 
hired me at QCOM, to Rocco Fabiano, who put me in a position to explore the intersection of wireless,

payments, and retail as we created Qualcomm Retail, and to Mike Hess, who brought a huge amount of retail 
knowledge into our division and who introduced me to the fine beer made by his namesake. On leaving 
Qualcomm, I didn’t expect ever to see another beacon at close quarters, but Issac Babbs persuaded me that 
it was worth staying with it. He was right. 
 I was reminded that writing could be fun thanks to David Kaplan and GeoMarketing, who have been 
a great publishing partner for the articles that preceded this book and who embraced the idea of mixing 
proximity marketing with Donald Trump, Arrogant Bastard beer, and arguments with your spouse. Thanks 
also to Ludovic Privat, the co-founder, editor, and managing director of  GPS Business News,  for first picking 
up and publishing my blog articles. 
 Staying in touch with the industry can be tough when you are working out of a home office. Fairbanks is 
a great therapy dog when a walk is called for to think things through, but he’s really coasting when it comes 
to keeping up with the “phigital” news. Conversations at the water cooler tend to be about household chores 
rather than industry gossip. Untethered.tv has filled that gap, and thanks go to Rob Woodbridge and Asif 
Khan for providing some great food for thought and to Doug Thompson for his Beekn blog that raised the 
bar for writing about all things beacon. 
 Before Apress agreed to be our publisher, Katy Loffman’s Rights Solutions helped give us a kick in the 
“right” direction and Kenny Waldron’s input provided a model of how a smart solution designer might 
respond to  The Guide . 
 Being born dyslexic (is that how you spell it?) may not be the best qualification for producing a tome 
like this. It’s only thanks to Jocelyn Statler, my Mum, and Derrick Crowe that the text is as intelligible as it are. 
Jo is a role model and has a level of patience and dedication that I can only aspire to. Derrick has gone way 
beyond the expected in his generous and extensive, detailed, and creative reviews. It’s great to find someone 
with a sense of humor, feel for narrative flow, and a pedantic insistence that we get the words and letters in 
the right order. 
 One of the best things about writing  The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Beacosystem  was talking to 
entrepreneurs and subject matter experts about the projects that they have been working on and hearing the 
lessons they learned. Thanks to Skype, we have spoken to people across the United States, China, Norway, 
Finland, Norwich, the rest of Great Britain, Germany, Poland, Australia, and Mexico. Thanks to all of the 
SMEs (subject matter experts) and case study subjects for their generosity and the free beacons! 
 Some special thanks has to go to Josh Marti and his team at Point Inside, the Gimbal team, Kevin 
Hunter and inMarket, Kontakt.io, HP Aruba, Sensoro, Estimote, Radius Networks, Steve Katz, Jon Azen, 
to Gustavo Litovsky from Argenox for a trove of great information on chipsets, and Shane Russell of 
ThoughtWorks for sharing his observations on signal propagation. 
 This book’s expiry date has been significantly extended thanks to Proxbook.com, the database that is 
tracking the hundreds of companies working in the beacosystem, including case studies and ways of slicing 
and dicing the data that comes from those companies that share their data through the site. Thanks to 
Thomas Walle Jensen and Kjartan Slette, the founders of Unacast, for taking a clunky WordPress plugin and 
making it wonderful. 
 Thanks to Welmoed Spahr’s team at Apress for giving us the latitude to do something out of the 
ordinary, subject-wise, with a crazy number of contributors, pictures, a quirky name, and an unorthodox mix 
of business and technical content. The Hitchhiker project wouldn’t have been picked up (get it?) but for the 
advocacy of Steve Weiss, Jeffrey Pepper’s stewardship, and the supportive massaging of the text by Melissa 
Maldonado, SPi Global, Waqar Malik, and James Markham. 
 Thank you to those of you who bought this book as a trophy for your book shelf but didn’t read it. We 
appreciate the money, the shelf space, and don’t consider you any the less for your lack of concentration or 
spare time. Chances are, dear non-reader, you bought our book because of the promotional video, which 
was created by our dear friend Don Rayner, whose rates are very reasonable, but are generally a lot more 
than what we paid in beer and hamburgers.

 Preface 
 Computers are bursting out of the metal boxes and machine rooms where they were born and are becoming 
embedded throughout the world in which we live. The communication technologies that enable what 
is called  the Internet of Things extends their reach to appliances in our homes and the meters and valves 
that regulate the flow in our heating, power, and water systems. The outputs have evolved way beyond 
the original paper printouts we used. Now these machines engage us through the voice of Siri, virtual 
reality headsets, and massive digital displays. The inputs are just as diverse, from finger-sensing layers on 
tablets, cameras that can guess our mood, and a wide variety of technologies that are designed to track 
the location of people and things. These are described variously as “presence,” “proximity,” and “real-time 
location systems”. The ability for computer systems to know where objects are located is key to what is being 
described as “digital to physical convergence”. This is where computers and the real world become melded 
together. 
 The Bluetooth beacon has taken center stage in this location technology revolution. These devices, 
which can be the size of a guitar pick, are being sprinkled around buildings, hidden away out of sight. They 
allow mobile phones to understand their location indoors, something that was very hard to do previously. 
They enable proximity triggers that can cause apps on our phones to start to interact with the world around 
us in new ways. 
 At one level they are very simple devices, but rather like the transistor, which helped to fuel another 
technology revolution, the possibilities are endless. Their successful use requires the understanding of a 
large array of related subjects. 
 Who This Book Is For 
 A lot of articles have been written about these Bluetooth beacons, but they tend to focus on fragments of the 
picture. This book is intended to be comprehensive. It’s been written for anyone who wants to understand 
both the big picture and the details of what’s required to create new products and services. 
 Hundreds of new companies are springing up to take advantage of the opportunities that beacons and 
other related technologies are creating. This book is written as a “survival guide” for anyone who has joined 
such a company or is thinking of starting one themselves. 
 Even for those of us who have spent a number of years working in this area, this guide to the 
beacosystem is proving to be useful. In the course of my consulting work for clients, I have found myself 
referring back to details of how the standards work and who some of the companies are in this space. 
In helping my clients get up to speed on beacon-enabled ad networks, it’s been helpful to refer them to a 
chapter that explains this new area. 
 It’s a big topic to understand thoroughly. In order to get the most out of the time you spend mastering 
this domain, we believe it’s important to have fun, and to share and explore some of the stories behind 
the development of the technology. We can’t promise as many laughs as Douglas Adams’ masterpiece 
 The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, but if you are fond of understanding some of the events and people 
behind the technology, if you enjoy getting to know some of the details that make you feel like an insider, this 
book is for you.  

 ■ PREFACE

 What You’ll Learn 
 We have divided the book into four sections. As computer scientists, we have adopted an approach of 
hierarchical decomposition (starting at the top and breaking the problem into smaller manageable chunks). 
The first one, Big Picture (Chapters   1 - 3 ), helps give readers a sense of the significance of the technologies 
and how they are being used. The second and largest section, Components (Chapters   4 - 15 ), breaks down 
into layers the products and technology in a beacon solution stack. This, along with the many real-
world examples, will provide an understanding of how the pieces can work together. In the third chunk, 
Technologies that Complement Beacons (Chapters   16 -  19 ) and What They Do, we look at a large number of 
competing and complementary technologies, so that solution designers can figure out the right tool for the 
job. Lastly, in Section 4, Using the Building Blocks (Chapters   20 -  22 ), we review the applications of beacon 
technology and where it’s making a difference. We drill down into payments in particular, because that’s 
such a strategic area, and lastly we look at some of the issues and opportunities that face the industry in the 
area of the future of the standards for Bluetooth beacons.

 CHAPTER 1  
 Introduction 
 Bluetooth beacons are changing the experience of using smartphones to travel, shop, work, and play. 
App developers can now link people’s movements through the physical world to events in the digital world 
of mobile apps, the web, and cloud services. As we walk around, we can trigger actions on our phones, 
point-of-sale terminals, digital displays, door locks, lighting, or any appliance with an Internet connection. 
Typing, pointing, and clicking drove our interaction with digital devices before the advent of the Bluetooth 
beacon; now our movements, location, and physical proximity to objects can trigger digital actions. 
 A Great Leap Forward 
 It appears we are in the early stages of another leap forward in the way technology impacts our lives. 
 Every now and then, rapidly advancing technology changes the lives of consumers, who are often 
oblivious to the details of that technological breakthrough. The resulting changes can be even more profound 
in the lives of the people developing the technology. For example, the advent of the silicon chip created a new 
class of entrepreneur in the Bay Area. Those of us not involved on the inside of the semiconductor companies 
noticed that calculators were getting smaller and cheaper, watches became digital, and computers could now 
fit on top of our desks; then, gradually, our lives changed as a result of those products. Yet, for the founders 
and employees of Fairchild Semiconductor, Intel, Microsoft, and Apple Computer, their lives changed even 
more. They lived at work, their marriages were tested, and some of them became very rich and achieved 
celebrity status. 
 I have worked at the center of two such leaps forward and am convinced that what we are seeing is 
a third. This one is to do with proximity technology and, in particular,  beacons that use a new  Bluetooth 
standard that is resulting in a cascade of changes in solutions built on Bluetooth and other adjacent 
proximity technologies. Such leaps can make for a fun ride. This book has been written so that the readers 
can equip and ready themselves to join in and reap the rewards that come with such technological 
progression. 
 Servers, Smartphones, and Beacons 
 The first technology disruption I experienced was in the mid-80s, when the computer server was being born. 
Up until then, serious computing was done on expensive mainframes. Servers allowed low-cost hardware, 
open software, and relational databases to coalesce and allow computing to be much more flexible and 
cost-effective. As a result, computer technology became used much more broadly. It was a gold rush. 
New companies sprung up and raced to win a dominant position in their niche. Lots of money was made. 
Company jets were bought. Great parties were thrown. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCTION
2
 The second big leap was the advent of mobile phones being used for computing tasks rather than phone 
calls. Through good fortune, I found myself working at Qualcomm, the largest provider of semiconductors 
for mobile devices. What would eventually become the smartphone revolution started with very basic, candy 
bar-shaped phones with small black-and-white screens. They were used for text messaging and browsing 
painfully crude (WAP 1 ) mobile web sites. These applications then flourished with the introduction of devices 
with larger screens and powerful application processors, as well as fast wireless modems. This brought 
computing, video recording, and many other tools into the hands of those who might not have had access 
to them otherwise.  Smartphones have been used to capture video of the Arab Spring, record views of crimes 
that would otherwise have gone unnoticed, and guide fishermen on the coast of India to where they can 
catch fish to feed their families. 
 Qualcomm owned essential patents for the deployment of smartphones and, as a result, received 
royalty payments whenever a smartphone was sold anywhere around the world. Qualcomm was making 
huge sums of money (over a billion dollars a month in gross profit), but it was also spending large portions 
of that money—as much as $5.5 billion dollars a year—on research and development in order to extend its 
lead and move the industry forward. These advancements were not limited to just faster CPUs and bigger 
screens, but incorporated a broad range of technologies and innovations. Qualcomm R&D developed 
computer vision technology, allowing phones to recognize objects in the real world. For instance, your 
phone could tell you if your car was getting too close to another vehicle. Another advancement augmented 
reality overlaid digital images onto views of the real world. This allowed Superman to jump from a poster 
in Walmart to entice shoppers into the toy department. Additionally, artificial brain technology started 
enabling phones to learn the significance of gestures that were personal to its owner. Then there came 
projects implementing some of the earliest Bluetooth beacon technology. 
 The  first  beacons were about the size of a guitar pick or a small key fob. These beacons were initially 
just going to be applied to help parents track their children. A child with a beacon laced to their shoes, for 
instance, could be automatically checked-in when they arrived at school, messaging a parent that all was 
well. Qualcomm’s HQ is in San Diego, a beautiful Southern California technology hub, that in previous years 
had seen abductions of young women which had shocked the community. Qualcomm’s President, Steve 
Altman, saw the opportunity for every smartphone to become beacon-aware and participate in an Amber 
alert network like no other. If a child were abducted, everyone’s phone could start listening for the lost child’s 
beacon and create a vast network, made up of the devices that we all carry, to help find the child and bring 
her home to safety. 
 The problem was that, in order to do this, the beacon technology needed to be added to everyone’s 
phone. To achieve that degree of ubiquity, it would need to become useful for things other than just dealing 
with these occasional crises. After this realization, a team was assembled to develop the technology further, 
create a business plan, and sell beacons for a broader set of applications. Gimbal was born. 
 At the time, I was working as the head of strategy for Qualcomm’s Retail Solutions division. Qualcomm 
Retail was given the opportunity to commercialize Gimbal and leverage our relationships with major 
retailers and retail technology suppliers. The process was a lot of fun. We borrowed a vending machine, 
sat it in my office, and tested what it would be like if beacons in a vending machine allowed selection 
and payment for the products with your phone. Armed with hardware purchased from Home Depot, we 
experimented with placing beacons in gas pumps and coffee machines. One of the biggest eye-openers was 
seeing what happened when we enabled customers at a cafe to pay by beacon: people loved it. No need to 
touch your wallet, just grab and go. 
 Then there was the work on business models. This required creativity with spreadsheets rather than 
computer code. We explored scenarios to understand how beacons could be sold, integrated, distributed, 
and supported. We searched the existing retail technology ecosystem to see whom the right partners to work 
with were and how those organizations could make enough money from this to sustain the ecosystem.

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCTION

 Then, with a change of CEO, Qualcomm Retail was no  more. The Gimbal team carved out and became 
an independent company and I decided to start my own business, Give the Change, in the non-profit 
sector, unrelated to beacons. I thought I had seen the last of the beacon business, but a mentor, a venture 
capitalist, advised me to “keep my hand in,” to ride the beacon wave. When it became clear that my start-
up needed more funding, I took the opportunity to develop a one-day training course for our local airport 
authority. Having seen the beacon-enabled cafe, San Diego International Airport wanted to deploy beacons 
throughout their terminals and needed to get up to speed on what could be done and how to do it. 
 Business and Technical Readers 
 This book has been written for solutions architects, be they businessperson or technologist. Solutions 
architects have many titles: Venture Capitalist, Founder, CEO, Strategist, Product Manager, CTO, Business 
Development, or Developer. If you loved to play with Lego blocks (or still do), you’re a solutions architect. 
This book is based on that training course, attended by the business and technical people required to make 
projects successful. It’s written for a diverse audience—the retailer and venue owners who want to augment 
the experience of their guest, the technologists creating the hardware and software, and the business people 
who need to allocate the resources required for these projects. 
 Teaching the course has been great fun, with business and technical people mixing and working 
together across the many industry segments involved in making these solutions. People working at chip 
designers, beacon manufacturers, middleware companies, and application developers have attended our 
open enrollment class. Hearing these students talk about why they are attending has opened my eyes to the 
possibilities of what can be achieved with beacon technology. Misconceptions about how beacons work and 
what they can do abound, but it doesn’t take much to build the type of solid framework where the chances of 
success for a project dramatically improve. 
 Understanding the technology at the root of this disruption is important if good decisions are to be 
made. This is a multidisciplinary revolution; marketing, finance, operations, business development and 
technology developers all need to work together for this to be successful. It is important that everyone 
understand enough of each other’s worlds that their differences can be bridged. If a businessperson thinks a 
beacon in the ceiling of a store will drive the experiences described earlier, they are in for a rude awakening. 
These beacons are awesomely powerful, but also have major limitations. If those limits are not understood 
on at least some level, the both technical and business teams are going to waste so much time and money 
that their competitors are going to win out. In addition, the technology developer has to be thinking about 
business issues. Waterfall development (a highly structured linear planning process) won’t work here. 
Unless the developers are customer facing and thinking about the operational and support issues, failure 
will be hard to avoid. 
 The purpose of this book is to establish a baseline of knowledge so that each of these disciplines 
understands enough about what Bluetooth beacons mean to their counterparts that they can move forward 
without wasting time on misunderstandings and conflict. 
 Part of breaking into a new ecosystem is learning the stories behind the technology. If these stories 
about how standards were named and the paths taken by the early pioneers seem superfluous to a strict 
understanding of how beacons work, they are. However, from my experience, assimilating into an ecosystem 
can be helped by knowledge of the folklore and the origin stories. Sometimes it helps to remember the more 
arcane facts. So a few such stories will be found peppered throughout the book, as well as an ample supply 
of metaphors that are characteristic of a high-tech industry that is always trying to bring excitement to what 
otherwise might seem quite dry.

 Online Resources 
 The beacon landscape is changing very fast. In order to extend the life of the book, we decided to build 
a crowdsourced database of beacon technology providers and case studies that anyone can access. It 
has taken on a life of its own, becoming more popular than I ever anticipated thanks to some “adoptive 
parenting” by our friends at Unacast. At last count, there were 280 vendors of proximity hardware and 
software registered at    www.proxbook.com  . Check it out. 
 It Takes a Village 
 It has been an interesting learning experience to meet other beacon enthusiasts and entrepreneurs writing 
about our industry. My first response to these other writers was rather competitive. Then, inspired by a local 
brewery, it seemed like there was a better way. 
 Here in San Diego we enjoy the work of over 100 craft brewing companies. One of the most successful is 
Stone Brewing, creators of Arrogant Bastard beer. They have an unusual relationship with the other brewers 
competing in the micro-brewing space. Rather than knocking the competition, they collaborate with them 
on brewing projects. Every year on their anniversary they invite their fellow brewers to exhibit at a beer 
festival that is a celebration of good food and drink. Their mission is to convert people to drinking craft beer 
(rather than fizzy yellow beer). Market share isn’t the issue; it is about building their category. 
 This seemed like a good strategy, so we have taken a similar approach with  The Hitchhiker’s Guide to 
the Beacosystem . If there was someone that we admired in this space who could help explore and explain it 
better, we have invited them to contribute. Everyone who has been asked has said yes. So we have chapters 
from experts whose time will be tough to get a few years from now. If the other leaps forward are anything 
to go by, a number of them will be too busy flying their executive jets around the world. Today the beacon 
ecosystem is small and early enough that it has been possible for them to collaborate, to write this book, and 
hopefully to grow the category by educating other enthusiasts to join in the beacon revolution. 
 We hope you have as much fun reading this as we have had learning about this space. Do join in and 
contribute to the crowdsourced information online. For interviews, updates and articles that supplement the 
contents of this book, visit    www.hhgb.us  . We want to read what you learn as the digital and physical worlds 
collide!

 CHAPTER 2  
 Orientation 
 
 
 Who would have thought that the Bluetooth beacon story would turn out to be such a great soap opera? 
The cast of characters is made up of entrepreneurs and their companies who are fighting to find success. 
We wonder which of the characters will succeed and which will be killed off. You look at the players and 
speculate as to what they will do next, which alliances will hold, and which are really just for show. Whether 
you are a technologist, an entrepreneur, a retailer, or someone considering his or her next career move, this 
story has something for everyone. All the elements are here: power, conflict, the plucky, small guy battling 
giants, and fortunes that will be won and lost. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ ORIENTATION

 New Experiences Created with Bluetooth Beacons 
 The story feels like science fiction, with screenshots of Tom Cruise in  Minority Report 1 being used to 
illustrate how beacons will change shopping, and scare stories about what will happen if this power is 
abused. Yet the technology to enable beacon experiences exists today. It is not a matter of being limited by 
technology, but by logistics and the evolution of an ecosystem. Deploying beacon enabled software takes a 
lot of time and effort. It is no small feat, and it means making changes to all the systems involved, upgrading 
hardware across thousands of stores in a chain, and all the staff training required for a roll out. Additionally, 
the user experiences we are creating are entirely new, so experimentation and rework is inevitable. We need 
to train the staff, and then we need to train customers, too. 
 Imagine  beacons powering digital displays welcoming shoppers by name and promoting products 
based on their taste and demographics; payments being made invisibly without the aid of cash or plastic 
cards. Guests at a coffee bar approach a barista, are welcomed by name, offered their “usual,” even though 
this is their first visit. They walk away having paid automatically, without having to touch their purse or 
phone. Television displays on gas pumps adapt the soundtrack being played so a patron’s favorite song 
greets them as they get out of their car. Then their favorite infotainment starts to appear on the built-in TV 
display before they even reach for the pump. Restaurant concierges greet you, ushering you straight to your 
table, even though the place is new to you. They know what you like, your dietary preferences, and introduce 
the menu accordingly. Waiting in line becomes obsolete, or at least a lot quicker. 
 Whether it’s a stall in the bathroom or a line for a beer, patrons are steered to where they will have 
their needs met fastest. Information about the world around you is fed to your phone and wristwatch 
automatically. 
 As in a presidential entourage, there will be an ever-present assistant providing the name of the person 
approaching you, the story behind the painting or statue that is nearby, and the details of a product that 
only a highly paid expert would know. Travelers at airports will be able to track the progress of their bags 
from the plane to the carousel. Waiting at the wrong gate for your flight? A helpful member of ground crew 
will know to steer you to the right location. Stuck in Home Depot trying to figure out which coupling to 
choose to fix your sink? Press a button on your phone and a helpful associate will find you, rather than the 
other way around. 
 Now realize that all of these experiences are being piloted and prototyped today. 
 Winners, Losers, and Unintended Consequences 
 Bluetooth beacon technology is disruptive. As a result, there will be winners and losers in this story. At this 
stage, there are some clues as to who those will be, but it will be interesting to see which players will come 
out on top. 
 This story started in stuffy meeting rooms and on boring conference calls when the  Bluetooth 4.0 
standard  was first conceived. The architects of that standard did not design it to implement beacons 
specifically—you won’t find a “Bluetooth beacon” specification referenced in the standard. The elements 
that enable beacons were created, but it took an ecosystem of onlookers to see the possibilities and put the 
new technology to work in this unanticipated way.

CHAPTER 2 ■ ORIENTATION

 Apple 
  Then  Apple ignited a firestorm of venture capital investment and innovation by a twist on that open standard 
with its own iBeacon offering, which formalized what had previously been created. Companies had been 
developing Bluetooth beacons prior to this, but when Apple briefly referenced its own standard (with a few 
words on a slide at their 2013 developer conference), the market took off. However,  iBeacon did not define 
everything that was required to produce a beacon solution. In fact, that it had major gaps was a key reason 
for its success. Other companies felt that they could fill those gaps and create enough value that they could 
build their own business, and so an ecosystem was born almost overnight. 
 The full impact of this interest in beacons has yet to be fully understood. It certainly extends beyond the 
current bounds of Bluetooth players, and the ideas for new applications are rapidly streaming from software 
companies and advertisers that have been galvanized by the iBeacon opportunity.  iBeacon   is one way to 
implement a proximity trigger for the purpose of marketing or other automation. Proximity triggers can be 
implemented using other technologies, which in some ways have advantages over Bluetooth. For example, 
the use of LED lighting systems offers greater accuracy, magnetic resonance is more ubiquitous, and small 
cell and 5G bring new economic incentives for companies to invest. We will discuss these other technologies 
later, but our primary focus is on Bluetooth Smart technology because it is at the epicenter of the explosion. 
It is creating a structure upon which other things can then grow. One day those other technologies may 
become bigger than Bluetooth beacons. iBeacon is like Lewis and Clark 2 , the first major expeditionary force 
from east to west, showing how the digital and physical worlds can be joined. Others technologies will 
follow, using their own approach to bridge these worlds.   
 Market Timing 
 The formation of successful technology ecosystems is like good comedy: it’s all about timing. A lot of things 
need to happen at the same time. The technology must be mature enough. The hype needs to be strong enough 
to attract consumers and entrepreneurs. The  ecosystem needs to show enough potential to inspire the many 
entrepreneurs needed to gamble on hundreds of variations of products using the technology. And investors 
need to have enough funds available to support all of this. This phenomenon is like achieving escape velocity 
in a rocket, in that, unless you have enough power to escape the gravitational forces of cynicism and inevitable 
setbacks, the rocket will be pulled back and crash, with much destruction of capital and few survivors. 
 The key to beacon technology flourishing is the mobile OS supplier. They can open up exciting 
opportunities for developers to fill, but they are also gatekeepers who can shut out whomever they want 
from the ecosystem. They can change or cut off services that developers have previously relied on and 
compete in areas where they previously partnered. They have a tough job, but an essential one. The  OS 
provider needs to create a technical equilibrium, balancing battery life issues, accuracy, responsiveness, 
privacy issues, decisions on where to impose rules and standards, and where to leave the field open to a 
community to innovate. By defining a limited standard and putting enough of the necessary ingredients in 
iOS, Apple threw gas on the flames ignited by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG). 
 Enter  Google 
 After two years of being largely absent from the party, with a Bluetooth stack that didn’t provide the basics 
required for beacons to work well,  Google has arrived. With its Eddystone offering, it “saw” Apple and raised 
the stakes significantly, with a beacon offering that delivered nearly everything that Apple had done with 
iBeacon and a lot more. Google appear to have made the most of analyzing the first movers and have entered

journey across the United States, from close to St. Louis to the Western Pacific coast of the United States.

the Beacon ecosystem with an offering that includes more in the way of functionality, security, management, 
and integration with the rest of the operating system. This was an important piece of the picture. Without 
Google and a native Android beacon offering, the largest part of the smartphone market (approximately 80% 
of the global handset market as of 2015) was unaccounted f or.  
 Where Are We? Crossing the Chasm 
 Let’s be clear, though, it’s still in the early days. To use Geoffrey A. Moore’s famous “crossing the chasm” 
model, we are in the “chasm” between the “early adopters” experimenting and the “early majority” buying in 
sufficient volumes to inject serious money into the ecosystem. This chasm is a long one. The walls are made 
steeper and the killing zone made longer because beacons are all about bringing the physical and digital 
worlds together. Software can be written and deployed faster than ever, but brick and mortar retailers and 
their armies of staff have to engage in these deployments as well. The human element has limits in terms of 
speed and resources that are more constrained than the world of cloud services.  Amazon can update the way 
its catalog searching works overnight, but we are seeing that even the leaders in applying beacons are taking 
many months to go through the necessary pilot and proof of concepts required to figure out the best way 
to use them. The ecosystem to deploy, place, and adjust the placement of beacons is not fully established. 
Even Apple, who deployed  iBeacon in their stores more rapidly than any other retailer, found its first efforts 
had major flaws that would take considerable time to address. Customers would get duplicate messages that 
became repetitive and unhelpful; the value was not clear to the customers in the store. 
 We should expect beacon companies to pivot 3 in order to survive. Some will supplement their beacon 
offerings with other technologies that can be deployed more quickly (such as GPS). Large numbers of them 
will exit this space because of the size of the “chasm,” and there will probably be more than a few journalists 
writing stories about the demise of the Bluetooth beacon. Yet, the real value is being created, and the 
few survivors that make it through the journey will likely have a very robust future reaping the benefits of 
physical-to-digital convergence. 
 Summary 
 Fortunately, beacon technology is very simple at its roots—a lot simpler than the first Bluetooth headsets. 
Beacons are small devices. They typically range in size from half an inch wide for a USB plugin beacon to 
five and a half inches in diameter for a beacon with a heavy-duty battery designed to operate for two or three 
years without physical maintenance. They can be placed in rooms or outdoors and can trigger your phone 
to automatically do things when it gets close. Your phone senses the presence of the beacon, recognizes its 
identity, and can take action accordingly. The action could be to display something on your phone screen, 
or to make calls to a computer elsewhere that will unlock a door, turn on a light, or play music. The possible 
actions are limited only by our imaginations. 
 There is no complex pairing between beacon and phone. These beacons are like lighthouses that 
broadcast with a one-way signal that phones can choose to see or to ignore. The closer the phone is to the 
beacon, the stronger the signal. Proximity is inferred like in a child’s game, where the seeker is guided by 
feedback that they are cold, getting warmer, warmer, and hot. If the signal is high, you are hot, and that 
means you are close to the beacon. If you know what the beacon is, knowing the proximity may be useful. 
Maybe it tells you that the keys that you desperately need to find, that have a Bluetooth beacon fob attached 
to them, are close at hand.

 Like Lego blocks, which are simplicity themselves if looked at in isolation, beacons can be combined 
into amazing structures that have additional layers of sophistication. The creation of today’s complex models 
surely wasn’t envisioned when the first brick with eight knobs on it was originally designed. The inventor 
of Lego (  Ole Kirk Christiansen  ) probably never dreamed that his bricks would be used to create replicas of 
amazing space ships or working digital printers. Likewise, what we see at the moment with simple Bluetooth 
beacons is surely only the start. 
 Our goal with this book is to guide you through the technology stack, use cases, operational 
considerations, standards and other pieces necessary to design new experiences. With this knowledge, you 
can build a strategy to take advantage of a disruptive technology that is bringing the digital and physical 
worlds together. When these worlds collide, great power can be released. Exploring the implications of that 
is the subject of our next chapter.

 CHAPTER 3  
 Digital Physical Convergence 
 Digital to physical convergence is talked about in the same breath as The Internet of Things (IoT). How do 
they relate and what do beacons have to do with these concepts? 
 Inputting to the IoT 
 The Internet of Things (IoT) phenomenon describes the trend where more and more of the objects around 
us are becoming smart and connected. Low-cost processors and communications technologies such as 
Bluetooth enable this. 
 Digital and physical worlds collide 

CHAPTER 3 ■ DIGITAL PHYSICAL CONVERGENCE
12
 IoT forces us to consider a world where more and more appliances and devices are becoming intelligent 
and linked together with digital connections. Our TV, lighting, door lock, garage door opener, refrigerator, 
and water meter are all joined together in a digital mesh. Should we, say, leave the fridge door open, while 
we are pedaling away on our exercise machine in another room, our presence is detected and the alert 
from the fridge causes a warning to appear on an adjacent TV. Beacons have a role to play as an input to all 
this; beacon triggers can inform our house where we are in its structure, triggering devices to react to our 
presence,  routing alerts like the one from the fridge to the right place and adjusting the heating and cooling 
to be more efficient. Outside of the home, digital displays in the street, in the aisles of a store, and at a point-
of-sale, represent outputs where personalized information triggered by our movements can be displayed. 
 Phygital Marketing is a term coined to describe this idea of bridging audiences from the physical world 
to the digital world, for a deeper and more relevant engagement with a brand or product. 
 This interconnectedness opens up many possibilities for integrating new experiences where beacons 
are triggering inputs into the IoT. There are also a number of other potential inputs to the IoT alongside 
beacons that we should consider as we design user experiences and business models. One is the RFID  tag  . 
 Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is sometimes seen as the older stepchild to the Bluetooth 
beacons. This technology has not enjoyed the meteoric rise and height of VC investment that beacons have 
received. However, RFID stickers have a number of strengths that have earned it a place in the palette of 
technologies that solutions architects can use. RFID stickers are lower in cost than beacons and they also 
transmit a wireless signal to identify the objects they are attached to. With RFID stickers attached to products 
in a store, an inventory check that might have taken days can be done in minutes. 
 Previously, the process would have involved laborious and error-prone manual counts. With RFID 
tags, a reader can be waved across the shelves and an accurate listing of each product, identified by its own 
serial number, can be entered into an inventory system. A heaped shopping basket full of tagged garments 
can be registered by a point-of-sale terminal in a second. The downside is that the hardware in our phones 
cannot read those signals, and so specialized readers are required, which is one of the limitations holding 
the technology back. 
 RFID is a great technology for tracking products, while beacons are great for tracking people (beacons 
are being used to track some high-value goods, but we will discuss this this later). Working together, with 
both a beacon and an RFID reader in a changing room at a clothing store, we can register what products a 
particular shopper is taking into the changing rooms to try on, and which of those products they then take to 
the point-of-sale to be purchased. This is a level of understanding of customer consideration and decision-
making that was not possible before . 
 Outputs from the IoT 
 Smartwatches are an important output device from the IoT. Unlike displays anchored to walls, the 
smartwatch can be with us all the time. The importance of this becomes apparent when we start work on the 
spreadsheet to build a business model for a new beacon business. This can be a sobering process. We start 
off with the excitement of a new beacon-enabled user experience, and then try to figure out how a business 
can make enough money to make the dream come true. 
 Typically, these  spreadsheets contain an estimated number of consumers that can be alerted by a 
beacon trigger compared with the value of that alert. If that alert is displayed on a phone in our purse or back 
pocket, the economic value is nil. However, if our user has a smartwatch on, the equation starts to look more 
promising. A smartwatch on someone’s wrist can display an alert to an opted-in user at any time along with 
a “haptic” 1  buzz. Now there is a fighting chance that our customer, who went to the trouble of downloading 
 1 Haptic output from a device stimulates our tactile senses with vibration, pressure, or movement. It’s used by the Apple 
Watch to attract our attention to an alert and can be used in virtual reality systems to add feedback to controls such as 
joysticks to create an experience that is more immersive and realistic.

a beacon-enabled app, will see the advertisement our business is getting paid for. Rather than a one in ten 
chance of revenue being generated, maybe the odds go up to 50/50 and our business is worth five times 
more. Of course this depends on the level of smartwatch adoption among our customers base, which adds 
another variable to our spreadsheet. 
 Location as Context for Mobile Apps 
 As we start to get creative, the beacon-enabled user experiences we design can seem futuristic and complex. 
Yet, some of the first examples of beacon-enabled apps were easy to appreciate and beautiful in their 
simplicity. One such app is called  Blush , which provides recommendations for shoppers at wine merchants. 
Using GPS, it determines which store you’re at and presents product information and recommendations 
by identifying what bottles might be in the store. With a few beacons dotted in different regions, it can also 
determine whether you are standing in the white wine or the red wine section of the store and focus its 
recommendations on the kind of wines you are likely to be seeing. 
 A shopper considering red wine could open their  Blush app and, without having to provide any input, 
see recommendations for the red wines in that store. No need to swipe and tap. This is so simple that it’s 
likely that the users of the application may not even realize what is happening; they are just experiencing 
a more intuitive shopping experience. Like good industrial design, good user interface design becomes 
invisible and unremarkable. 
 The same kind of thing has been done with apps that are promoting items in a convenience store. 
When these apps are beacon-enabled, all of the same offers will be presented to the customer, but, as the 
user stands in front of the display of potato chips, the promotions are automatically sorted so that the 
product offers that are closest to the user are shown at the top of the limited display on the phone. In this 
instance, the ad for the potato chips would be featured at the very top. Having the right offer visible “above 
the fold” could make a big difference in the conversion rate and the happiness of both the shopper and the 
storeowner. 
 Of course, this contextual ordering based on proximity doesn’t necessarily have to be about selling 
products. Mobile apps that show the times of trains arriving at a subway platform, for example, can now 
automatically present the times of trains arriving at the particular platform where the passenger is standing. 
Removing the need to do a scroll or search within the app can minimize the time it takes the users to get the 
information they require. 
 Art galleries and museums are one of the most popular venues for deploying beacons. Presenting 
information about the work of art that is in front of visitors—and saving them the trouble of having to key 
in dozens of codes as they wander around a gallery—makes for a much simpler, less frustrating experience. 
While many museums, such as the Los Angeles Contemporary Museum of Art, are creating their own apps, 
there is an app called  Bubble that supports this use case and can be configured within a few minutes to 
operate in a new venue. A companion app is used to associate a beacon with some digital content, like a web 
site, text, image, or video. Seconds later, the user of the Bubble app can see the relevant content “bubble” up 
on their display, perhaps a video that describes how the art was created. 
 Automated Retail  
 The future of retail and the experiences enabled by beacons are intertwined. Beacons have many 
applications outside of retail, but this market has a special significance when it comes to the development of 
the beacon ecosystem. That is, retail is huge, with over 4.5 trillion dollars of spending each year in the United 
States alone 2 .

 Most of us go shopping on a regular basis, so retail applications are a great way to get technology into 
lots of people’s hands. Not just once, but frequently enough that their use can become habit forming and 
start to spread. It’s no news that the retail industry is under intense pressure from ecommerce players like 
Amazon. As such, retailers are responding by attempts to capitalize on their greatest strength and their 
greatest liability: their brick and mortar stores and the staff who works in them. 
 High-end retail  can be enhanced with beacon applications that allow the staff to be better informed 
about the needs of the customers in the store. Associates are being armed with tablets that display profiles 
of the customers as they arrive, in order to help provide a better experience. A customer’s retail app can 
respond to a beacon trigger by sending information about the customer’s history and preferences to the staff 
so that they might offer what has been called “clienteling”  services . 
 These services were offered on a small scale in the old days when merchants knew all their customers 
personally, but that has become almost impossible in the modern world with multi-national retailers serving 
tens of thousands of customers at single locations. However, now beacon-enabled apps allow for the “mass 
customization” of retail, with experiences tailored to each customer. If a shop assistant at Home Depot knew 
more about us—such as the products we had previously bought and our level of expertise—shopping for 
hardware tools could be more like the experience high-end shoppers enjoy with a personal shopper at a 
Nordstrom or another premium merchant. 
 However, not every shopping experience can be improved with high-end clienteling. Sometimes a good 
shopping experience is about efficiently dispensing commodities and effectively using real estate and staff. This 
is where automated retailing has the potential to dramatically evolve away from the rusty vending machine that 
loses our small change. The kind of experience offered by Redbox when vending DVDs outside grocery stores 
and gas stations is expanding to include everything from high-end electronics to caviar and cup cakes. 
 Selling high-end watches may have large enough margins to support the hiring and training of a sales 
force that can deliver good service. Yet, more often than not, sales staff are paid poorly and, except for a few 
notable exceptions, you tend to get what you pay for. As a result, according to a survey commissioned by 
Trade Doubler 3 , 72% of shoppers felt the information they got from their smartphones was better than what 
they got from the average shop assistant. 
 Spurred on by these statistics, the new generations of the 4.6 million vending machines 4 in the United States 
are becoming more intelligent. With the integration of the same mobile data modems we find in our phones, they 
are joining the Internet of Things. Vending machines are now downloading media to display on high-definition 
screens, calling back to base with orders for specific replenishment of their stock and accepting credit cards and 
mobile payments. This creates a great technology platform on which to add Bluetooth beacons. 
 Our Redbox machine could add a beacon that the Redox app would recognize and then inform us that the 
sequel to the movie we just watched is now available at the kiosk that we will pass on our way out of the store. 
 High-end coffee vending machines require us to tap through endless choices of beverage type, size, 
caffeine level, strength, and milkiness. Using beacons, these can now greet us by name and ask us to press a 
single button to confirm that we would like our usual. When customers get served faster and wait times go 
down, sales go up. 
 Beacons in airline kiosks at airports can trigger a conversation between the kiosk and our airline app, 
speeding us though the check-in process. Ordinarily, this is a frustrating task because we are often forced 
to reenter information that we previously entered online. With this beacon triggered machine-to-machine 
dialogue, our smartphone speeds us through check-in. 
 Even gas pumps are being enabled with the same high-end processors that are being put into our 
phones. Rather than getting the same short-form entertainment video that every other customer gets, 
why shouldn’t a beacon trigger your petroleum app to personalize your experience? It could request news 
content to be displayed when one customer fills up, and fashion tips when another customer arrives. At the 
same time, we have the opportunity to eliminate the questions about payment method and the grade of gas 
our car needs by having our phone communicate directly with the fuel dispenser .

 Ecommerce Meets Bricks and Mortar 
 From a retailer’s perspective, digital to physical convergence means that nearly all of the marketing and 
analysis that Amazon can do in the digital world of its web store can be done in a brick and mortar store. 
 Amazon brought huge sophistication to retailing, analyzing the behavior of shoppers, what they looked 
at, and their click-path through the site. In the same way, beacons can enable an analysis of individual 
shoppers’ footpath through the store, including how long they dwell at different locations. 
 This is something that was possible before beacons, but only in regard to shoppers in the aggregate, 
using video cameras and computer vision to track the flow of customers around the store. Computer 
vision can infer gender, age, and mood by applying algorithms to the video feed from security cameras, but 
beacons can monitor specific shopper’s behavior in stores and then present that shopper with offers and 
promotions that relate to where he or she spent time when last in the store. 
 These promotions can appear in-store via digital displays and then again when they browse the web 
after leaving the store through a process called “retargeting”. Retargeting is commonplace on the web today. 
Anyone who has browsed products on a retailer’s site and has then seen ads for the same products when 
they move on to read the news on another site has experienced retargeting. With the use of beacons, the 
same analytics and recommendations that are seen as part of Amazon’s strength can be determined and 
applied based on a customer’s behavior in the physical world. 
 Amazon also offers advantages in terms of ease of payment (One Click Checkout). Beacons, though, 
can enable no-click checkout, certainly for small ticket items, at least. A beacon can be used to detect an 
individual’s proximity to a point-of-sale (PoS) terminal, and that individual doesn’t even have to touch 
their phone or wallet. A second authentication factor can be applied by using a photo of the shopper on the 
display of the PoS. 
 Amazon has created such an awesome shopping experience that they are able to provide those 
storefront experiences while seamlessly layering them onto other merchants’ fulfillment/delivery services. 
In the same way, a beacon-enabled experience could allow inventory free storefronts to focus on the look, 
feel, multi-media, personalization, and clienteling. Apple’s approach to selling the Apple Watch previews 
one retailer’s strategy of removing inventory from the physical store, and instead focusing on the experience 
in the store to sell and take orders that are rapidly delivered from inventory stored elsewhere. 
 By abstracting the in-store shopping experience away from the inventory and fulfillment, the brick and 
mortar store can offer a much broader range of products. In some stores there may not even be a stock room. 
After all, the space used to stock inventory shrinks the space available to sell products. Now all of the store’s 
space can be devoted to selling, with inventory cached in nearby warehouse facilities for same-day delivery.  
 Indoor Mapping 
 It’s hard to remember a time when we couldn’t use maps applications on our cell phones to find our way to 
new restaurants, businesses, and peoples’ houses. I have a vague recollection of struggling to fold and unfold 
huge paper maps and a lot of arguments with colleagues and relatives about where we might be on these 
things as they flapped around the car. 
 Thanks to beacons, in the future we will probably take for granted the ability to find our way around any 
airport or shopping mall, and our ability to optimize our route through a warehouse store and go straight to 
the products we are interested in. 
 It’s likely that providing self-sufficient navigation for the partially sighted may accelerate the 
infrastructure deployment. Currently, blind people can get help from sighted strangers to help find where 
they want to go, but they miss out on understanding the facilities that surround them. With beacons, they 
can be informed where restrooms, exits, stores, and kiosks that are especially equipped to help them 
are located. A voiceover commentary relayed to them via bone conducting headphones allows visually 
impaired people to listen to the ambient noise and this extra information at the same time. Ambient noise is 
important to the visually impaired in order to navigate around obstacles such as walls and people. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ DIGITAL PHYSICAL CONVERGENCE
16
 With beacon business models, one question that needs to be answered is “how do we get people to 
download the beacon-enabled app?”. This can be the low point of the business modeling discussion. Smiles 
tend to disappear when the total available market (TAM) that a beacon app can address gets slashed by an 
order of magnitude. 
 The encouraging thing about indoor navigation is that our smartphones all have at least one maps 
application that we are very familiar with, so once they fully support beacons, that barrier to adoption will 
be removed. These maps applications are potentially going to be doing a lot more than telling us how to get 
from A to B. They will be surfacing relevant points of interest, businesses, and even products and services. 
As a consumer, my search isn’t necessarily going to be for a hardware store; I could search for the product 
I’m interested in and could be guided from my sofa to the shelf the product is sitting on. What a great 
opportunity for any company that owns a maps application and also has an advertising business (Google?). 
 The Help Button and e911 
 Once the indoor mapping infrastructure is in place, there are additional opportunities. Customers that need 
help in a large department store will be able to press a “Help” button on their phone and an assistant will 
be able to find you, rather than the other way around. They may be coming to you with a lot of information 
about who you are. If you are a big spender, you may find that you get service faster than another shopper 
who is not so loyal to the store. 
 Government regulation can be a significant force in driving the adoption of technology. It was the 
U.S. Federal Communications Commission’s e911 rules for phone carriers regarding their ability to locate 
911 callers quickly that drove investment in the assisted GPS chipsets that help us to navigate to our 
appointments. In big cities and large buildings, e911 is quite ineffective, so carriers are being asked to solve 
that problem. One response is to build a GPS network that transmits from towers rather than satellites, an 
alternative is to use the low-cost beacons that have so many other commercial uses. 
 Location-Aware In-App Advertising 
 A large proportion of free applications are funded by in-app advertising revenue. Beacons have the potential 
to make those apps that sit at the bottom of our Angry Birds and Sudoku games a lot more targeted and so 
increase their value to the app developer. If you are sitting at a departure gate, avoiding thoughts of the pangs 
of hunger that are building by immersing yourself in the trajectory of small birds whizzing across your phone 
screen, you may be reminded that there is a McDonald’s so close to you that you can probably smell the 
french fries. Early trials of location-based offers have shown they are significantly more effective the closer 
the item being promoted is to the viewer of the ad. This doesn’t bode well for our waistlines.  
 Summary: What’s Next? 
 These applications give you a sense that there are some engaging user experiences that can be enabled 
and add value for the stakeholders. Before we dive into how the technology works, in the next chapter, let’s 
consider a framework to organize the kinds of components that will be required to deliver these experiences. 
From this framework, businesspeople and architects can get a sense of who they would need to engage with 
to build a solution. Developers can consider the components they will need to develop or build on. Investors 
can consider where the opportunities and the risks are greatest.

 CHAPTER 4  
 Beacosystem Framework 
 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ BEACOSYSTEM FRAMEWORK
18
 The framework we are about to explore is about more than Bluetooth beacons. The arrival of the beacon 
caused an explosion of entrepreneurial creativity and spawned an ecosystem that is enabling a whole range 
of proximity technologies. As we will discuss in the chapter on alternative technologies, each proximity 
technology has its own particular strengths and weaknesses, but they all benefit from the software and 
services that are coming together around Bluetooth beacons. 
 Our framework also forms the basis of a shopping list for the builders of solutions. They can look at 
vendors and decide which of the framework components they want to use from a given firm. 
 When evaluating the companies that you want to do business with, it’s useful to refer to a framework 
such as this so you can evaluate the completeness of a vendor’s offering. Ticking more boxes doesn’t 
necessarily mean the offering is stronger; if a vendor is trying to cover the requirements of products in all 
the boxes, this may be cause for concern. It’s hard to do all things well, and in terms of managing the risk 
associated with a solution, it’s advisable to design in the ability to achieve a level of interoperability so that 
components can be switched out. Adopting monolithic proprietary solutions can leave a bad taste in the 
mouth of those held hostage when they are locked into such solutions. 
 When I was learning to drive, my instructor was very keen to instill a sense of “lane discipline”. The 
idea being that you would stick to your lane on the highway, rather than weaving from one to the other in 
an unpredictable way. It was okay to change lanes, but you needed to indicate clearly to those sharing the 
road what you were about to do. This approach can work well in technology if you want to have partners to 
complement and extend your offering. If partners are not clear what your company is doing and what it is 
not doing, those partners will probably be suspicious and not commit the resources required to work well 
with your offering. 
 I can think of one beacon vendor who has enjoyed early success and has used the resulting cash flow to 
rapidly develop functionality in most of the boxes in this framework. Some of these are token elements that 
lack the depth of the core product, which brought them their initial success. They are now finding it hard to 
attract the partners that could complement their core product because those partners see them as having 
competitive offerings. 
 Since each of these elements is described in a chapter later in the book, we will review the framework 
at a high level to start with, so as to provide a sense of the categories of products that are coming together to 
create the Bluetooth beacon ecosystem or “Beacosystem” for short. 
 Standards 
 Bluetooth beacons came into existence, not because of some huge breakthrough in science, but rather 
because of the introduction of new standards that were widely adopted for other applications. Bluetooth 
4.0 was built into low-cost chipsets that consumed very little power and provided a means to trigger actions 
in smartphones that came into proximity with these devices. The power consumption of the beacons using 
these standards was so low that they could be run on batteries lasting for years. Battery powered devices can 
be installed by anyone with a head for heights and the ability to follow directions, rather than requiring an 
experienced electrician and the routing of cables. So standards enabled huge economies in both the cost of 
manufacturing and operations. 
 iBeacon then provided a level of endorsement from Apple, which is unique in its role as a maker 
of phones owned by relatively wealthy people and an operator of one of the most successful chains of 
retail stores ever. These stores provided a great showcase for the technology. This endorsement boosted 
confidence among entrepreneurs. They saw momentum and opportunity, with VCs who were willing to fund 
them and a market to sell to, and with venue owners looking for ways to be relevant as digital technology 
became more important to shopping and entertainment. 
 These standards were not complete. They didn’t address the world of Android phones (which came 
with the creation of the Eddystone standard by Google two years after the arrival of iBeacon). This Android 
market is larger than that of Apple’s iPhone, especially when you look at it globally. The standards didn’t

address a number of important security and management issues, but these gaps have created opportunities 
for innovation. If anything, the gaps, rather than being seen as deficiencies, have drawn in more venture 
capital investment (to create products to fill them). 
 Chipsets and Beacons 
 The  chipset vendors are largely invisible to the users of Bluetooth beacons, but their role is key. Beacon 
vendors have been able to build products around chipsets that support a large proportion of what a beacon 
is required to do. Purchasing a System on Chip (SoC) takes the beacon vendor a long way down the road 
to having a functioning product. A single chipset can include the components required to enable an API 
interface that responds to analog radio signals, temperature input, and motion sensing. This is not like the 
early days of computing, where the makers of computers had massive numbers of radically different internal 
components. A beacon vendor can expect the chipset vendor to provide a component that requires a few 
additions to be complete: a battery, an antenna, a circuit board, a case, system software, and a management 
system. To be sure, other components can be added, but the ease with which new beacons can be created 
helps to explain why there are so many startups that make their own beacons. 
 This is not to diminish the art of making a great beacon. It’s all too easy to make a bad beacon—with 
poor reliability, inconsistent behavior, missing features, poor environmental characteristics, a short battery 
life, hard to manage, and doesn’t keep up with the rapid evolution of the standards. As a beacon vendor, if 
you can avoid all those pitfalls, you are rare indeed. You then need to be able to master the same challenges 
that a good brewery does when producing beer in great volume. Producing a great product in small volume 
is just the start. You have to manage a supply chain, with sufficient inventory to respond to unpredictable 
peaks in demand. You also have to maintain quality and master sales and distribution. On top of that, you 
need to be good at strategically choosing markets that are maturing enough and large enough to feed the 
organization and provide the tools to cultivate a developer ecosystem to produce software that works well 
with your product in those markets. There are very few beacon vendors that have been able to do all of 
these things.  
 Operating Systems 
 The landscape of smartphone  operating systems (OS) that worked well with beacons was easy to draw 
through 2014. There was a single box labeled Apple iOS. In 2015, Google’s Android OS improved its 
Bluetooth stack to support the 4.0 standard. The beacon vendors filled some of the missing components 
required to create beacon-enabled Android apps. The role of Windows Mobile is insignificant as of 2015. 
Even though Bluetooth 4.0 is supported, few beacon manufacturers are acknowledging its existence. In a 
market as fast moving and competitive as the Beacosystem is, no sensible beacon OEM would divert the 
resources required elsewhere to support an operating system with less than 3% market share, absent a major 
deal sweetener from Microsoft. 
 The operating system suppliers are in an incredibly important position. What they do to balance 
performance, battery consumption, privacy, and ease of use is critical to the success of the beacosystem. 
Given the value in other areas of the beacosystem stack, it seems inevitable that they will gradually start 
to annex some of those more lucrative areas or commoditize them by growing the scope of the standards, 
cutting the lifeblood from some players and making the fortunes of the companies that they acquire. 
The beacosystem is such a fast moving market, it’s hard even for Apple and Google to anticipate how the 
technology will evolve, so it makes sense to “outsource innovation,” by seeing who has done a good job 
and acquiring those teams and their technology. Many a startup has created an exit strategy based on 
this scenario.  

CHAPTER 4 ■ BEACOSYSTEM FRAMEWORK
20
 Fleet Management 
 Pilot projects and demos tend to require a small number of beacons, but a large venue can require many 
hundreds of the devices. If you multiply the number of venues by the thousands of outlets that a chain of 
big box stores might have across the United States, the management challenges of maintaining an inventory 
of these hundreds of thousands of devices is significant. Specialist software is essential to knowing where 
the beacons are. Tracking their health, making changes to their configuration, and updating the software 
becomes quite a challenge. It’s the kind of challenge that causes CIOs to sweat and the CFOs at solutions 
providers who can solve this problem to smile. Using large numbers of people to solve these management 
problems is expensive and error prone, so the return on investment of effective management software is 
relatively easy to show. 
 This area is the natural refuge of beacon hardware vendors looking for a market to monetize their 
solutions. The solutions to applying software and adjusting parameters tend to be proprietary due to a lack 
of standards for the management interfaces for beacons (as of May 2016 Google have started to address this). 
For beacon vendors that have succeeded in having their products used in large-volume applications, they’ve 
had to solve these management problems to survive. The beacon vendors who may have sold one or two 
beacons to large volumes of consumers to track keys and other such items will not have had to develop such 
solutions. 
 Orchestration  
 The API calls that a beacon triggers are fairly low level and primitive. A beacon may be triggering a large 
number of events on the handset of a nearby user, which need to be filtered and interpreted in a broader 
context before it’s sensible to send a message to a user of the device or report on something that would be 
interesting from an analytics perspective. Users don’t want to receive a hundred alerts as they approach a 
beacon. 
 It may be that a welcome to a particular department in a big box store is appropriate only if the shopper 
has something on their shopping list that is available in that area. The application may want to check the 
signal from multiple beacons to be confident that the user is in the right place in order to record the presence 
of a shopper in that department. Converting lots of low-level proximity triggers and combining them with 
rules and other information is the key to unlocking the value in what can be achieved with beacons. 
 This is new uncharted territory, which makes it a great area for startups to carve out a niche. Unlike 
Bluetooth chipsets, there aren’t a host of large incumbent firms that have been doing something very similar. 
This area is so new that we have struggled to decide what to call it. Today we are calling it  orchestration . As 
with a large group of musicians, the role of the conductor here is key. The score that will be played is not 
fully defined in advance. It’s likely to evolve based on the experiences accrued and develop in ways that 
are hard to predict. This makes it one of the most interesting spaces to watch. Companies like Rover Labs, 
Local Social, Pulsate, and  indoo.rs are some of the players that are innovating in this space currently. Their 
focus is less on creating whole apps and more about creating middleware, which is software that other app 
developers can include in their apps so as to give them a leg up in building a proximity-aware app .  
 Analytics 
 Many of the early beacon hardware vendors described themselves as  analytics companies. This is ironic as 
they often sold hardware with a minimum of software. There wasn’t much in the way of tools that could take 
all the beacon data their hardware produced and turn it into actionable information. Customers were lucky 
if they got a bar graph. The slogan from the old Wendy’s hamburger commercial comes to mind: “Where’s 
the beef?”. 

CHAPTER 4 ■ BEACOSYSTEM FRAMEWORK
21
 There are a huge number of well-established analytics companies. They range from specialist statistical 
package vendors, providers of cool visualization tools, and companies that have focused on location-based 
analytics using technologies other than beacons that haven’t included beacon event data into what they do. 
 A lot of very interesting insights can be gained with just the data from beacons, such as the dwell time in 
front of different paintings in an art gallery, or the different paths of people in a shopping mall based on the 
time of day. However, the most interesting insights normally come when integrating other external data. If 
we can integrate art museum membership data, we can segment that data and see where young men linger 
and where new members linger versus well-established members. We can analyze the impact of attending 
an educational event on what people do in a gallery. Do people who have watched the introductory video 
linger longer? Do they tend to look at a larger number of paintings? Our beacon insights get a lot more 
interesting . 
 Payments 
 Beacons can make the payment experience more convenient for customers and more lucrative for retailers 
and brands. They can create opportunities to buy more and to look at the effectiveness of those efforts. 
 We call  payments out as a specific application because of the potential economic and strategic value. It’s 
also a very challenging application and has been a dangerous siren for other technologies such as  near field 
communication (NFC) . The adoption of NFC technology was arguably close to being derailed because there 
was so much conflict between technology vendors, banks, and retailers on how it would be used. Payments 
is an important area and has such economic significance that people almost forgot that NFC could be used 
for other things that were quick and relatively easy to implement. Beacons have probably benefited because 
companies have applied the technology to other use cases. 
 Beacon  Directories 
 Beacon networks are a hugely important and valuable phenomenon in the story of this technology. One 
beacon can be used by multiple applications. If retailers place beacons in their stores to enable their 
apps, but then allow other applications to access the same beacons, the value of the beacons increases 
considerably. These other apps could be developed by brands that are promoting specific products in the 
store, shopping list apps, or the maps app that can provide navigation around the store. 
 As Beacon networks have started to form, we have categorized them into three types. The most 
fundamental is the  beacon directory , which tracks where beacons are and maintains metadata that describes 
the beacon and its location. 
 While there exists a range of beacon directories that do nothing more than track the location of beacons, 
the other types of beacon network, which do more than this, have this directory function as their foundation . 
 Beacon  Access Networks  
 Enterprising builders of beacon networks often want to charge others for the privilege of accessing their 
beacons. In order to do that, they need to restrict access and make it conditional on a “pay-to-play” basis. 
This is referred to as a  beacon access network. 
 Not all beacons are restricted in this way. In the case where there is no “conditional access” function, all 
you need is to discover the address of the beacon through a beacon directory and you are ready to access it 
for fr ee. 

CHAPTER 4 ■ BEACOSYSTEM FRAMEWORK
22
 Beacon  Commerce Networks  
 Beacon networks can be used for all sorts of purposes, but advertising is probably one of the most lucrative 
areas. Beyond the functions we have just touched on, a proximity ad network operates at a much higher 
level, providing all of the functions of the online ad networks, with a lot more personal information that can 
be used to understand what kinds of people and what kind of circumstances might trigger an ad. Beacon-
enabled ad networks then offer the possibility of new levels of personalization, interaction, and attribution 
that can measure the effectiveness of ad spending in ways that can’t be achieved with web ads. 
 A beacon-enabled ad network could target people who had just come from cinemas at a certain time 
of day, present them with offers for certain kinds of restaurants, and then see how effective the ad was at 
influencing where that person goes to eat. 
 Beacon commerce networks may offer ad delivery features or they may allow the correlation between 
the presentation of an advertisement to an action such as a visit to an area within a store where the 
advertised product is sold. 
 The essence of a beacon commerce network is that there is additional business functionality built into 
 the network service, beyond simply controlling the access to a beacon. 
 Applications 
 Having spent our time looking at the plumbing and the features that beacons can enable, we will look at 
some of the issues specific to creation of beacon-enabled applications. 
 It’s easy to be overwhelmed by the possibilities of beacons, which can be debilitating. This is the 
paradox of choice. The more choices there are, the harder it is to find one that works. 
 Is there a structured way of looking at the use cases that beacons can implement so as to allow us to 
be more effective in applying the technology in creative ways? We think so. There are certain core patterns, 
such as “the check in” that are core to beacon apps. As we map those limited applications and organize 
the variations on those themes, it’s possible to simplify the problem, while at the same time stimulating 
creativity and the boosting of new applications based on those core use cases. 
 Summary 
 Now we have looked at the beacosystem and its components at a high level, it’s time to dig into the details 
of each of these components and build a solid understanding that we can use to design our solutions and 
business ideas.

 CHAPTER 5  
 Standards 
 Standards Overview 
 Fundamental to the  explosive growth of the beacon market is the role of a number of key standards. Imagine 
where we would be without technology standards. Life would be harder for both developers and consumers. 
Developers would have to work in isolation, building out almost every component of their systems by 
themselves. These monolithic systems would be expensive to produce and would require a huge amount of 
expertise across all of the components.  Costs and risks   would be prohibitively high. Fortunately, that is not 
the world in which we live.

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
24
 These days we take for granted the ability to plug any DVD player into an amplifier. In days gone by, 
when standards in that area were less mature, systems tended to be monolithic. You had to buy your record 
player, amp, and speakers from the same manufacturer. Now consumers have choice in the components 
they choose. Building a solution from best of breed components is a given. The same principle that goes for 
the audiophile consumers and their HiFi  systems goes for solutions architects building their solutions using 
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth standards. 
 With standards and interoperability, reuse becomes possible. With reuse, ecosystems grow faster and 
bigger. Growth in the volume of components produced for one application of a technology can bring down 
costs that make a second application of the technology viable in a way it wouldn’t have been otherwise. The 
economics change, and the benefits of experimentation and innovation reach a whole new level as different 
companies, with no relationship other than their use of a common standard, can build on each other’s work. 
Best of breed combinations add extra competition and increase quality. 
 The Bluetooth 4.0 standard provided the foundation for what inspired the beacon movement. When 
Apple added on their own iBeacon standard, they threw gasoline onto a fire that was already smoldering. 
Bluetooth beacons were being built prior to what Apple did, but Apple’s endorsement was key. Beyond 
defining a standard, Apple enhanced their operating system to provide features that helped to make sure 
beacons could work, and work well. They developed privacy controls, optimized response time, tuned 
handset battery consumption and integrated beacon functionality into a pre-installed app, Passbook (now 
called Wallet). They also became early adopters of iBeacons within their own retail stores. 
 The Apple retail stores are seen as being leading edge by other retailers and boast the highest revenue 
per square foot of any major retail chain.  Apple’s Enterprise Sales teams (who focus on selling Apple 
products to businesses) open up their stores for other retailers to see, using them as a demonstration 
environment to illustrate how Apple devices and software can be used to build a compelling shopping 
experience. 
 The iBeacon  standard also had impact on Google’s Android mobile operating system, which can 
respond to the same iBeacon hardware that iOS apps see. Beacons operate the same way, no matter what 
device or OS is receiving the signal. While Google hasn’t endorsed Apple’s iBeacon standard, it has improved 
its Bluetooth stack so that beacon-aware Android apps can be triggered by a Bluetooth beacon, whether 
that is an iBeacon or a beacon using some other standard. Two years after iBeacon was introduced Google 
introduced a competing set of standards called  Eddystone . One of the standards included in that portfolio 
(Eddystone URL) aims to go beyond the limitations of iBeacon by removing the need to install an app in 
order to act on a beacon broadcast. Also known as the Physical Web project, Google’s vision is that we will 
use the browsers on our mobile devices to select from URLs broadcast to us by nearby beacons. This has the 
potential to make a profound difference in the way beacon technology permeates our lives. 
 While  Google was planning their response to iBeacon, others attempted to fill that gap. Radius 
Networks created a standard called AltBeacon as an “ALTernative” to iBeacon. These are standards that are 
key to the beacosystem. Let’s get to know each of them in more detail.  
 The Bluetooth Standard 
 The great thing about Bluetooth as a standard is that its  market penetration is massive. It also has significant 
brand recognition (see Figure  5-1 ). It’s hard to argue with any standard that has been responsible for 
tens of thousands of products and more than 10 billion Bluetooth devices 1 . For those of us who want to 
build solutions, this kind of momentum is great because it introduces a level of confidence in at least 
one component of the solution. Less argument about the technologies an architect uses implies a lower 
perceived risk and a greater willingness for stakeholders to move forward with confidence. The momentum 
behind Bluetooth is accelerating.

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS

 Bluetooth 4.0 is the original standard that inspired the beacon revolution. Shipments of Bluetooth 
4.0 devices are forecast to grow to 2.9 billion by 2016. Big numbers are important as the input to any business 
development professional’s planning spreadsheet. They also provide a great basis for economies of scale to 
reduce the cost of hardware. 
 The “not so good” thing about Bluetooth is that with familiarity, there also comes some baggage. 
When you say “Bluetooth,” many people think of problems with connecting their headset to their phone 
and frustrating searches for setup instructions that have long been lost. The fact that Bluetooth has been 
synonymous with pairing devices is problematic because the Bluetooth Smart part of the 4.0 standard 
is what our beacons use, and for the most part there is no paring or connection between a beacon and a 
phone. 
 Bluetooth 4.0 consists of two separate protocols under one banner: the legacy or Classic connection-
orientated protocol used for linking audio devices, and Bluetooth Smart, a quite different set of protocols 
that coexist with Classic but behave very differently. 
 Broadcast versus  Connect 
 In order to understand how Bluetooth beacons work, think of another kind of beacon, the lighthouse on 
a rocky peninsula. Passing ships that see the beacon can judge the distance between their ship and the 
rocks, but do not have a connection with the lighthouse itself. The lighthouse keeper doesn’t know how 
many ships are passing by in the fog, but the ships are hopefully seeing his signal. So it is with Bluetooth 
beacons. A single beacon can be broadcasting its signal from above the stage in a concert hall. Thousands 
of smartphones can register that signal, but the beacon won’t know if there are ten or ten thousand phones 
listening to its broadcast, or maybe none at all. 
 The same is true of radio stations. I remember working at a radio station on a college campus, reading 
the news and playing records into the small hours of the morning. A skeptical student wandered in and 
asked us how many people were listening. We had no idea; we could have been playing music to ourselves. 
Embarrassed, we told our visitor that there was a meter we could look at to see if we had any listeners. Of 
course, it wasn’t true. Such is the case with beacons: there is no indication on the beacon side of things as to 
how many mobile devices are picking up their signal. 
 Eliminating that connection simplifies the protocol and allows it to scale beyond the eight device 
limit that constrained the number of connections possible between Bluetooth 3.0 devices on a Bluetooth 
“piconet”.

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS

 Origins 
 Early on in its history, the Bluetooth standard was managed through the Institute of Electrical and 
Electronics Engineers (IEEE). It was known as 802.15.1. The spectrum it used (2.4 - 2.485GHz) happens to be 
the same band of spectrum that is used by another  IEEE 802 standard , the standard for Wi-Fi 802.11. Now, 
the IEEE no longer plays a role in the Bluetooth standards process; instead it’s managed by the Bluetooth 
Special Interest Group or SIG. There are over 20,000 members of the SIG, and over 48,000 Bluetooth product 
models. You have to join the SIG if you want to make a device that uses Bluetooth. Fortunately, membership 
at the basic level is free. If you want to get access to the Bluetooth standards documents, go to their web site 
at    www.bluetooth.com  and sign up. It’s a quick process. 
 The biggest category of devices that use Bluetooth is the  Audio and Visual collection of devices   (26,759). 
There are also over 11,000 other devices using the standard in a range of categories from mobile phone 
accessories to emerging categories such as medical devices 3 . 
 The spectrum that Bluetooth and Wi-Fi share is called “unlicensed,” because, unlike the  cell phone 
spectrum , companies don’t have to buy a license from the government to use it. We all share that piece of 
bandwidth. This has the benefit that consumers don’t have to buy a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth plan from a telco 
to use a Bluetooth device. The downside is that there is no one managing the level of use of this shared 
part of the airwaves relative to the capacity available. As a result, it can get crowded with an unlimited 
number of devices competing to use the spectrum. This creates some uncertainty and the risk that if 
you get a lot of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices operating in the same vicinity, they will interfere with each 
other. The responsiveness of Bluetooth beacon apps and the timing of when an app sees a beacon can be 
unpredictable. The fact that the spectrum used by beacons can be crowded with Wi-Fi is one of the reasons 
for this unpredictability. 
 To deal with this, the Bluetooth protocol uses a rather clever technique called frequency hopping. 
Bluetooth divides the spectrum that it can use into 40 separate channels and sprays packets across those 
channels, hopping from one channel to the next 1,600 times a second (how cool is that?). So rather than 
having conflicting devices locked into using the same channel, shouting over each other, the packets will 
generally pass each other by. This technique dates back to World War I when it was used by the military to 
avoid malicious attempts to jam signals or listen in. 
 Some More Bluetooth History 
 The telecom vendor Ericsson invented the technology that became Bluetooth in 1994. 
 The Bluetooth name  originates from the medieval (Figure  5-2 ) King of Denmark, Harald “Bluetooth” 
Gormsson. One of the explanations for his nickname is that, due to the poor dental care available in the 10th 
century, he had a severely discolored “gnasher”. The king’s name was used because he united Norway and 
Denmark, two countries that would otherwise have wasted their resources warring with each other. The idea 
of the new standard was to unite the different groups within Ericsson, IBM, Toshiba, Intel, and Nokia, which 
had previously been working on competing standards.

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS

 Bluetooth was the temporary working title for the standard, to be used while the marketing team came 
up with the proper name. That marketing project started in 1997. The main contenders for the proper 
name, “ RadioWire ” and “ PAN” (Personal Area Network ), never saw the light of day 4 and so the working title 
“Bluetooth” became the commercial name. 
 The Bluetooth logo is derived from a combination of the Nordic runes (ancient alphabet) for the king’s 
initials. The H (      haglaz  ) and B (     berkanan  ) 5 , when combined, become  
 .

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS

 The standard was conceived as an alternative to using wires to connect local devices. The different 
versions of Bluetooth, up to version 3.0, focused on improving quality, speed, and robustness. 
 By 2001, Nokia had identified some use-cases that were not supported by Bluetooth and developed 
a product called Wibree. It offered a new, low-energy protocol for rapid connection and transmission of 
simple messages. 
 The new protocol used the same spectrum as previous versions of Bluetooth, but was different from the 
Classic Bluetooth protocol in terms of its functionality, throughput, security, and latency. 
 The protocol was brought into the Bluetooth fold in 2007. Its working title was  Bluetooth Low Energy 
(BLE), but was ultimately called Bluetooth Smart in 2010 because its capabilities went beyond simply using 
less power. “Smart” has application specific features organized into a large number of profiles that enable 
integration of new devices beyond those traditionally associated with the Classic standard, devices such 
as watches, heart monitors, bikes, and thermostats. Use of the BLE acronym is officially frowned upon by 
the SIG as they attempt to gain momentum around the use of a unified brand name (Bluetooth Smart) that 
encompasses more than the low-energy features within the standard. 
 So, how much lower is the energy consumption? Nominally the low-energy chipsets consume half the 
power, or less, of their  Classic predecessors . This enables devices using the new technology to potentially last 
for over a year on a coin-sized battery (see Figure  5-3 ). Although exactly how long will vary wildly, depending 
on a number of factors that we will explain later. 
 To recap, Bluetooth 4.0 is the version of the standard that encompasses both Classic and Smart stacks. 
In other words, Bluetooth Smart is a subset of Bluetooth 4.0. 
 Classic, Single Mode, Dual Mode, Smart, and Smart Ready 
 As you consider the applications you want to support, it’s important to understand whether the chipset that 
you are using at the heart of your system is Bluetooth Classic, dual mode, or single mode. 
 Classic Bluetooth is the term used to refer to the version of Bluetooth (3.0 and earlier) that predates the 
support of the functions we are concerned with here. Dual-mode Bluetooth chipsets support the Classic 
functions, like streaming audio  signals , as well as the new low-energy functions such as sending beacon 
packets or communicating with a heart monitor. A dual-mode  chipset can drive a connection with an “old 
school” voice headset using the Classic stack, while also sensing the presence of a Bluetooth Smart beacon. 
 The Bluetooth Classic chipsets don’t support the new 4.0 standard including the low-energy operations 
required. So if your PC doesn’t have a dual-mode chipset, no software upgrade can enable it to talk to a 
Bluetooth Smart blood pressure monitor. 
 Figure 5-3.  A  coin-sized CR 2032 battery 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
29
 One real-life example where this limitation impacted a project was when we realized that a Bluetooth 
Smart device we had developed would not be able to detect the presence of the Classic Bluetooth devices 
embedded in many car radios. This became an issue when a business partner wanted to create a futuristic 
gas pump with our Bluetooth device looking for the Bluetooth signature from car radios. They wanted the 
pump to recognize the brand of the cars that approached the pump. If you could recognize the make of 
car, you could infer a lot about its driver. You could then have used the pump to sell all sorts of things to the 
car’s driver based on that insight. Unfortunately, our chip was a  Bluetooth Smart Single Mode device , so it 
couldn’t detect the Bluetooth Classic signals coming from the radios in older cars. 
 A Bluetooth device such as a PC that can interface with both Bluetooth Smart devices, like beacons, 
and with Bluetooth Classic devices such as keyboards, will have a dual-mode chipset and is called  Bluetooth 
Smart Ready . Smart Ready devices work with the classic devices but they are also “ready” for the new ones 
(see Figure  5-4 ). 
 Economics Favor Smart Devices 
 The new dual-mode  chipsets are no more expensive than the old Classic chipsets, so device manufacturers 
have been using the new hardware and making devices that supported Smart even before having software 
that makes use of it. As a result, in 2014 there was a large number of Android phones that were Bluetooth 
Smart capable, but they lacked the version of Android that would expose the Smart functions. Users who 
upgraded to Android 4.3, which added Bluetooth Smart support, suddenly found they had access to Smart 
functions they never knew their phones possessed. 
 Conversely, single-mode chipsets are even smaller in size, cost, and power consumption and are what 
most beacon manufacturers use in their beacon devices. 
 The first device to ship that supported Bluetooth Smart was Apple’s iPhone 4S in October 2011. Given 
that the typical replacement cycle of smartphones in the United States is two years, the majority of iPhone 
users in the United States should now have a Bluetooth Smart capable device.  
 Bluetooth Profiles 
 Who would have thought that we would have Bluetooth Smart enabled locks on our front doors? Beyond 
emitting a cool blue glow from the bezel, these devices are remarkably useful. Such doors can be unlocked 
with nothing more than the touch of your fingers, relying on a secure authentication by the phone in your 
pocket. Digital keys, which expire after a few hours, can be sent to visitors and contractors. Bluetooth 
functionality has come a long way since the days of simply replacing the cable on your keyboard.

 Bluetooth Smart uses an architecture that enables a large and growing number of profiles, which can 
be used to support applications to connect devices in the Internet of Things. An example of a Bluetooth 
low-energy profile is the  Find Me Profile (FMP) . When a button is pressed on one device, this profile causes 
an alert signal on another associated device to activate. Using FMP, your phone could active a buzzer in your 
wireless headset to help you find it when it gets lost in the sofa. 
 These profiles are written using an underlying, lower-level profile specific to Bluetooth Smart  called 
GATT (Generic ATTribute profile) . GATT enables a set of lower-level operations, such as setting a value on 
a remote device that might be used to change its behavior. The higher level profiles built on  GATT   include 
general-purpose profiles like BAS (the battery service that exposes the state of a battery within a device), as 
well as collections of profiles applicable to vertical markets. Examples of these in health care and sports and 
fitness include: 
 Health Care 
• 
 BLP (Blood Pressure Profile)—For use with blood pressure measurement devices 
• 
 HTP  (Health Thermometer Profile)—A nurse or doctor could take a patient’s 
temperature using a thermometer and have that information automatically uploaded 
to the patient’s file 
• 
 GLP (Glucose Profile)—For   blood glucose  monitors 
 Sports and Fitness 
• 
 BCS (Body Composition Service )—To enable measurement of body fat, body water, 
bone mass, and muscle mass 
• 
 CSCP (Cycling Speed and Cadence Profile)—For sensors attached to a   bicycle  or 
  exercise bike  in order to measure   cadence  and wheel speed 
• 
 CPP (Cycling Power Profile)—Measuring the cycle crank revolutions and torque  
• 
 HRP  (Heart Rate Profile)—For devices that measure   heart rate  
• 
 LNP  (Location and Navigation Profile)—Shares location, speed, and estimated time 
of arrival characteristics 
• 
 RSCP (Running Speed and Cadence Profile)—Gathers information such as speed, 
stride length, and distance traveled 
• 
 WSP (Weight Scale Profile)—Can transmit the name of the person being weighed, 
how much  they  weigh, and the time of the measurement 
 Profile use isn’t required in order to write applications that use Bluetooth beacons, but it does give you a 
sense for one of the dynamics influencing the broader adoption of a key standard at the heart of the Internet 
of Things. Quite surprisingly, there is no SIG-defined beacon profile. 
 Device manufacturers can develop their own profiles using GATT, and so Apple has developed its own 
iBeacon profile that is part of its proprietary standard. We will go into more detail on that in the next section. 
 iBeacon, You Beacon, We All Beacon 
 iBeacon is a standard defined by Apple and controlled with a license agreement that beacon manufacturers 
have to sign in order to use the logo and claim their product is iBeacon compatible. However, iBeacons are 
not Apple approved. Apple doesn’t test the beacons. As a result, strict conformance to the iBeacon standard 
is patchy. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
31
 iBeacon defines the data packets that a beacon sends as well as the iOS APIs that software developers 
can use to access those beacons. That being said, entrepreneurs can create Bluetooth beacons that can 
be accessed on iPhones without signing the license agreement 6 or using the iBeacon brand. They can still 
broadcast packets that conform to the iBeacon structure or use their own proprietary format and write 
applications using the CoreBluetooth APIs instead. CoreBluetooth offers lower level, more general  Bluetooth 
functionality . It doesn’t offer the capabilities that Apple, as OS developer, has created for iBeacon that 
distinguish it from other proximity technologies. 
 When Apple defined iBeacon, manufacturers who had already been making beacons raced to embrace 
this new standard. Doing so meant changing the way their hardware worked and signing the iBeacon license 
agreement. So, why did so many go to that effort, just to earn the right to claim that they sold “iBeacons”? 
 This went beyond the mere desire for prestige and respectability that comes with claiming the rights to 
use what has become such a hot product name. As much as anything, it was the iBeacon-specific capabilities 
included in iOS that drove the stampede. These include:
• 
 Privacy controls —The ability to integrate location privacy controls into iOS, managed 
under Settings ➤ Privacy ➤ Location Services (see Figure  5-5 ). Playing nice with 
privacy is an important element of keeping users happy and receiving Apple’s 
approval to put your app into the App Store.

and   mfi.apple.com/enrollnew 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
32
• 
 Alerts —The ability to display  alerts when a beacon is detected, even when your app 
is in background mode (i.e., another app is being viewed or the screen is locked).  
• 
 Restart —The ability for your app to be restarted when an associated iBeacon is 
detected. Even if the user quits the app, or if the phone is restarted, as long as your 
app has run once, it will be brought back from the dead when a relevant iBeacon is 
detected. 
• 
 Regions —The ability to efficiently act on triggers when entering a large number of 
 geographic regions . 
• 
 Ranging —Use of the  Ranging API that allows signal strength to be used to gauge 
proximity. 
• 
 Apple Wallet —Integration with  Apple Wallet , which comes preloaded onto iOS and 
can’t be removed. Apple Wallet is part of the foundation of Apple Pay and can display 
passes to the user when a geofence is crossed or a beacon is sighted. Passes can take 
the form of coupons, digital boarding passes, or tickets to the movie theater. They are 
easy for developers to create using XHTML and can be downloaded from ads, web 
pages, or by scanning a QR code. They represent a very useful way of engaging a user 
while they are carefully seduced into “going all the way” and downloading your app. 
We cover Apple Wallet in more detail in a later chapter.    
 Many beacon manufacturers that support iBeacon create their own Software Developer Kit with 
proprietary APIs that sit above the  Apple iBeacon APIs . These offer access to additional features that may be 
important to the management and use of their beacons. By doing this, they lock in their customers in a way 
that may not be apparent, given those customers believe they are using the iBeacon standard. This is not to 
say there aren’t good reasons to include these proprietary extensions, but business people need to be aware 
that their ability to switch from one iBeacon vendor to another may be limited by these necessary, vendor-
specific APIs. 
 Before we go into the details of what these extensions are likely to include, let’s make sure we are clear 
about the core components of the iBeacon Standard. 
 Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) 
 One of the most important things to understand about iBeacon is how beacons are identified. As the number 
of beacons around us explodes, applications need to establish which beacons they are interested in being 
alerted by. That selection is via the beacon’s UUID.  iPhone applications don’t see all the iBeacons that 
surround the device; they only see beacons with the specific UUIDs that the application writer has asked iOS 
to look for. 
 Universally Unique Identifiers are 128-bit numbers that are assigned by the manager of the iBeacons to 
identify groups that will share functions. 
 iBeacons you receive from the factory may be programmed with a default UUID that is specific to the 
manufacturer.  Estimote beacons , for example, come programmed with a UUID of  B9407F30-F5F8-466E-
AFF9-25556B57FE6D ; Radius Beacons default to  2F234454-CF6D-4A0F-ADF2-F4911BA9FFA6 , and Kontakt.io 
beacons default to  F7826DA6-4FA2-4E98-8024-BC5B71E0893E . 

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
33
 
THE NUMBER SYSTEM USED WITH UUIDS
 UUIDs are represented as 32 hexadecimal (hex) numbers. Rather than decimal numbers (base-10 
numbers) which range from 0 to 9, hex numbers are base-16 and range from 0-15, with 10-15 being 
represented by A through F. That is to say, A in hex equals 10 in decimal, B equals 11, and so on. Using 
hex allows a simpler translation to the binary (base-2) code that is used to store these UUIDs in the data 
packets that whiz from beacon to mobile device. Hex F can be represented in four bits as 1111. Unless 
you are going to be doing low-level programming, you don’t need to remember the details. Suffice it to 
say, when it comes to UUIDs, think of the letters A-F as numbers (10-15). 
 UUIDs are not just used to name iBeacons. They have been in use for decades. First standardized by 
the Open Software Foundation, they are used across many databases, programming languages, and 
networks to identify objects. 
 While UUIDs are not guaranteed to be unique, you are statistically more likely to be hit by a meteorite 
than you are to create a duplicate UUID. 
 If you are going to be deploying your beacons for a serious application, you will probably want to 
choose a UUID to identify your beacons that is unique to your application. That way your app will only be 
alerted to the presence of beacons you own and care about. If you were to use the default UUID, your app 
would be alerted by the presence of beacons that had nothing to do with your intended use. In a world with 
iBeacons deployed in vast numbers everywhere we go, the battery life of handsets would be hammered if 
every beacon woke up every beacon-aware app that was resident on people’s phones. 
 So how do you decide what your UUID should be and how do you make sure that number is unique? 
Unfortunately, there isn’t a central registry of UUIDs to ensure your number is unique. And making a 
number up such as  11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111 or  FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF 
isn’t a good idea; someone will already have used that one. Fortunately, you can use a utility to come up 
with a UUID that is fairly random. The theory is, given that between a series of 0s and all those Fs there are 
340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 possibilities, a random number is probably going to be 
unique. 
 Mac users can use the terminal command to get to a  $ command prompt and type  uuidgen  to do this 
(as illustrated in Figure  5-6 ). 
 Figure 5-6.    Output of the uuidgen command from the Mac OS X terminal window 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
34
 Otherwise, you can go to   https://www.uuidgenerator.net  to generate your unique UUID 
(see Figure  5-7 ). 
 Major and Minor Device Numbers 
 The other two numbers used to identify an iBeacon are its major and minor device numbers. 
 Figure  5-8  shows a beacon configuration app (from Estimote) that is displaying the UUID and the  major 
and minor device numbers of a beacon that has been sighted. 
 Figure 5-7.  Output from the   www.uuidgenerator.net  UUID generator 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
35
 The idea behind having these two numbers in addition to the UUID is that they can provide a hierarchy 
that can be used to organize an addressing scheme for multiple locations within an organization. This can 
be likened to our addressing scheme for traditional “snail mail” letters. Similar to the UUID,    one’s country is 
the root of the hierarchy, with town (comparable to the major device number) coming next, and then street 
(the minor device number). Combining them lets you identify a precise subset of beacons within a vast 
network.  
 As shown in Figure  5-9 , if McDonald’s were to deploy beacons, they might choose a random UUID,    
such  as 34A5E9EF-7E09-4BCE-8D52-81357FA57AF3 , to identify all their iBeacons. Then the major device 
number might correspond to a specific location ( 36374 for Rancho Bernardo, CA) and the minor number 
might correspond to the logical location of the beacon within their stores.  
 Figure 5-8.    Estimote beacons are managed via an app that displays their identifiers, the UUID, major and 
minor device numbers, and their MAC address

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
36
 A minor device number of 10 could correspond to the first drive-through lane, 20 could correspond 
to the first point of sale terminal inside the store, 30 could correspond to the drink fountain, 40 could 
correspond to the front door, and 50 could correspond to a beacon placed in the seating area.  
 If this McDonald’s app was triggered by a beacon at the door, identified by  34A5E9EF-7E09-4BCE-8D52-
81357FA57AF3, 36374, 40 at 12:05 pm, and then was triggered by another beacon at the point of sale, 
identified by  34A5E9EF-7E09-4BCE-8D52-81357FA57AF3, 36374, 20  at 12:15pm, you could infer that it had 
taken a customer 10 minutes to be served by finding the difference between the times at which the customer 
was sighted by the door beacon and by the POS beacon. 
 Of course, while inside the store, the McDonald’s app would probably detect all of the beacons. It would 
then need to use the relative signal strength of the uniquely identified beacons (using the major and minor 
device numbers) to infer the customer’s position within the store.

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
37
 Masking Your UUID 
 Having beacons broadcast three numbers (UUID and major and minor device number) to identify 
themselves is an elegant and simple idea. Knowing these numbers, multiple apps can use the same beacons 
to trigger actions when those beacons become visible. What could possibly go wrong? 
 As it turns out, quite a lot. These numbers are being broadcast “in the clear,” unencrypted, so any 
application can read them, whether the owner of the beacon likes it or not. So in addition to the apps the 
beacon owner writes, these identifiers can be viewed by a myriad of Bluetooth scanning utilities using the 
 CoreBluetooth libraries available on the Apple App Store, as well as apps that might choose to use this 
information against the beacon owner’s interests. 
 Showrooming and Piggybacking 
 The nightmare example of this scenario is known as “ showrooming ,” where ecommerce retailers make use of 
a brick and mortar competitor’s store to influence the purchasing decisions of a prospective customer. And 
just when that customer is about to buy, they could steal the deal. Theoretically, an ecommerce retailer like 
Amazon could program their mobile app to look out for iBeacons that Best Buy, the electronics retailer, had 
deployed to work with their own mobile app. If Best Buy put iBeacons in their TV department to trigger the 
displays of specific offers and product information for customers looking at those products, the Amazon app 
could also wake up and engage Best Buy’s customers with a lower priced offer to buy the same TV online. 
Best Buy gets to pay for the show room, the inventory and the staff, and in this example Amazon gets the deal 
without having to cover  those  costs. 
 Another example of unauthorized use of beacons where a third party is “ piggybacking  ” their application 
onto the infrastructure funded by a retailer might be an app from a product manufacturer, such as Sony. If 
Sony provided you with a free app that could act as a remote control for your Sony TV, the app could also 
look out for the Best Buy beacon in the TV department and engage you if it looks like you are shopping 
for another TV. Best Buy would probably feel like they should get some compensation for providing that 
infrastructure to Sony, especially if they want to promote a competitive brand in situations where they are 
benefiting from better profit margins from that manufacturer. 
 Spoofing 
 Another potential problem with these UUIDs being in the clear is that, once the addresses are known, they 
can be reproduced by programing a duplicate set of beacons with the same numbers. If an app has been 
developed to offer prizes, coupons, or other value to a user as a reward for going to a specific location, the 
app can be tricked into thinking that the user has gone to the location when they have not. 
 An example of this is in the context of an exhibit hall, where visitors are being incentivized to visit 
certain booths. An app might see a beacon, recognize the UUID and the major and minor device numbers, 
and determine that the user is standing in an exhibition hall in the Las Vegas convention center, even if the 
user is sitting on his sofa at home. 
 This happened with a scavenger hunt at the  Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in 2014. Visitors 
were being encouraged to visit a range of booths where they would check in and their app would register 
their presence and award a badge. After collecting a full set of badges, the visitor could collect a prize. 
Unfortunately for the booth owners, the minor numbers that distinguished the different booths were 
sequential from  65001 to  65009 . Knowing this, programming a beacon to spoof these addresses was easy. 
A large number of apps on the app store allow you to turn your phone into an iBeacon, enabling you to set 
any UUID and major and minor device number to be broadcast in seconds. This method of completing the 
scavenger hunt would have been a lot less tiring for visitors than walking the halls of the exhibition center, 
but would have robbed the booth owners of the opportunity to make their pitch. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
38
 However, for this exact reason, the CES Scavenger Hunt used a secondary auditing system (collecting 
timestamps of when the beacon was sighted) to increase the confidence that contestants actually went 
to all the targets. The system could still be spoofed, but it would require quite a bit more conniving and 
manipulating, making it hardly worth the effort. 
 The risk of spoofing undermines the case for using what we will call “vanilla” iBeacons—plain beacons 
with nothing added—in environments where value is being exchanged for the simple knowledge that the 
customer showed up, and was in a given place at a given time. Most retailers would be unwilling to offer 
discounts, coupons, or loyalty points if they were unsure the data they were getting about the customer’s 
presence was reliable.   
 As far as the showrooming risk is concerned, this is serious too. No executive at a retailer wants to announce 
a cutting edge proximity-marketing app, only to be seen to be helping their competitors. The leadership of 
retailers like Best Buy has already been purged as a result of not dealing with the most basic showrooming 
threat: customers using their Amazon app in stores to price compare. How much more damaging will the 
problem be when it’s magnified by regular location-specific reminders to do this even more? 
 Showrooming is less of an issue if the retailer is vertically integrated. That is, they manufacture the 
products they are selling themselves, like American Apparel, whose stores sell the T-shirts that are made 
exclusively in American Apparel factories. Retailers like this don’t mind so much where you buy your 
American Apparel T-shirt. Now, let’s think, which other retailers are vertically integrated? Ah, yes. Apple. 
 This leaves the beacon manufacturers in a bit of a bind. On one hand, they want to have the marketing 
boost of claiming Apple iBeacon compatibility, and they want to get the benefit of the enhancements in 
iOS afforded to iBeacons. On the other hand, many want to solve the showrooming and spoofing issue. 
What to do?  
 Defeating the Spoofers 
 The solution that some beacon vendors have adopted is to blend a proprietary non-iBeacon packet 
piggybacked along with the standard iBeacon packet. 
 If the iBeacon UUID and major and minor device numbers are left to a default value, and are the 
same on all the beacons dotted around a venue, they no longer provide much useful information. The real 
information about the identity of the beacon can then be hidden in a proprietary packet that is broadcast 
separately. 
 Another approach to this obfuscation is to rotate the values of the UUID and the major and minor 
device numbers based on a predetermined sequence that uses a secret private key that resides on the 
beacon. The app that sees these values then calls up to a cloud service that resolves the ever-changing 
numbers and converts them to another ID that the app can use to figure out which beacon it is talking 
to. To any unauthorized app that doesn’t have the benefit of this cloud service, the UUID just looks like a 
constant stream of changing numbers. Any map of UUIDs in a store becomes useless shortly after the UUID 
is recorded.  
 This approach to resolving a dynamic ID to a constant, static address is similar to the way the Internet 
works with  Domain Name Servers (DNS) . We expect    www.google.com  to be a consistent URL address, but the 
underlying IP address of the server we connect to can change. That mapping is done for us by the DNS. 
 Being Connected Becomes More Important 
 The downside of this approach is that the app relies on being able to make calls up to the cloud in order 
to make sense of the beacon UUID. With a vanilla iBeacon, connectivity is not required in order to read 
the UUID. The beacon can be identified in an underground bank vault, in the middle of the desert, or in a 
remote Walmart with no cell coverage or Wi-Fi. This downside isn’t as significant as it might seem, given 
that most apps already require connectivity for other reasons that are central to their operation, e.g. the 
ability to pull down product information, offers, or  payment authentication   via the cloud. For situations 

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
39
where disconnected operation is essential, it is possible for the app to pre-cache the information required to 
resolve the identity of the beacon in advance of losing wireless contact. 
 The upside of requiring a cloud connection with your beacon is that you insert a point in its architecture 
to be able to record the app’s location events. This can become the cornerstone of analytics services, pricing 
models based on number of location triggers and the ability to piggyback a whole range of other cloud-
based services, from configuration management and over-the-air firmware updates to advertising.  
 Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) 
 The measurement of signal strength is central to the way Bluetooth beacons work. At a high level, it’s simple. 
When your mobile device detects a beacon, if the signal is strong, then you know you are close to the beacon. 
If the signal is weak, you are farther away. 
 Figure 5-11.  A meter measuring signal strength in dB 
 Let’s double-click on that. There are some more complex factors that impose fundamental constraints 
that should be understood by business and technical people alike. Invest a bit of time understanding this 
and you can avoid misconceptions that impact the user experience, the business model, and operational 
considerations. Skim this section at your own peril. The simple view of measuring signal strength can be 
thought of like those hide-and-seek games most of us played as children. As you get closer to the thing you 
are looking for, your friend is shouting at you, “You’re cold, you’re getting warmer, warmer, you’re hot, you’re 
on fire!” In fact, that’s about as accurate as you may be able to get in many situations when using beacons. 
See how Gimbal’s app conveys the cold, warm, hot measures in Figure  5-12 . Don’t expect your beacon app 
to act like a tape measure with centimeter) accuracy at all times. 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
40
 Even though they only have limited accuracy, don’t despair. Beacons have a lot of strengths to make up 
for these limitations. There are techniques that can mitigate the issue and, if need be, there are alternative 
technologies that we can pull from our “proximity solution kit bag” to work in conjunction with beacons 
when needed. For most simple uses, though, high levels of accuracy aren’t required. Which is good, because 
all those alternative tools have their own limitations and costs, making it important to understand which tool 
to use and when. 
 We will go into a number of these other tools later in this book in the chapter that covers alternative 
technologies. 
 Non- Linear 
 The first detail to understand is that there isn’t a linear relationship between signal strength and distance. 
Rather, signal strength and distance have a logarithmic relationship. So the farther you are from a beacon, 
the less accuracy you will get; the closer you are, the more accuracy you will have. So when someone asks, 
“How accurate is a Bluetooth beacon at measuring distances?”, the answer depends on how close you are to 
the beacon. There isn’t a single answer that can be given in feet and inches. The farther away you are from 
the beacon, the less accuracy you will have. You can detect the difference between a phone being one inch 
versus twelve inches from a beacon, but you can’t tell the difference between a phone that is 19 feet versus 
20 feet away from a beacon. 
 The Medium Impacts the Message 
 Another factor that impacts the signal strength is the medium that the signal is traveling through. Lower 
frequencies of radio  signal are better at penetrating through mass. Bluetooth operates at a 2.4GHz frequency, 
which is a high frequency with a lot of hertz, or cycles per second. Mobile phone carriers consider the lower 
 Figure 5-12.    The Gimbal app displaying the signal strength of a beacon: one inch away from the phone, 
eight feet away, and 50 feet away 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
41
frequency spectrum more valuable, but they have to pay more for it. The 2.4GHz bands, on the other hand, 
are free, but you get what you pay for. One of the consequences of using this high frequency spectrum is 
that, if you wrap your hand around a beacon or stand between a Bluetooth beacon and someone’s phone, 
you will significantly decrease the strength of the signal that gets through. That drop in signal could be 
misinterpreted as meaning that the phone is farther away from the beacon. 
 Figure  5-13 provides an illustration of the last two topics we have been discussing. You can see that 
when the Bluetooth signal is traveling through air, the difference in signal strength between zero and ten feet 
is over 20dB, while the difference between 20 and 30 feet is about half that. When we get out to 60 versus 
70 feet, there is no difference. We also see that when you stick a person in the way of the signal, at 10 feet 
we measure a similar signal strength to what we were getting at 15 feet when there was only air between the 
phone and beacon. So in our app, we don’t know if we are 10 feet away or 15 feet away. The takeaway from 
this is that it becomes very important to be conscious of where we place the beacons in order to minimize 
the effects of interference from people’s bodies, or to account for that in the way the app is designed. We will 
get back to this later. 
 Water is an effective signal shield. The fact that our bodies contain so much water explains why our 
presence attenuates the Bluetooth signals so much. 
 Notice also that the introduction of metal objects makes an even bigger impact on the attenuation 
(reduction) of signal strength. That metal could be in the shape of shelving, a milk shake machine, or even 
the metal in the walls of an office. Placing a metal plate in the path of the signal made the beacon appear to 
be another ten feet away. 
 It’s important not to be discouraged by these factors, because, while they can create problems, they also 
create opportunities to control where the signal goes. For instance, if you want to stop the Bluetooth signal 
from spilling outside a store, using metal objects to shape the signal can be a helpful tool.

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
42
 Decibels (dB) 
 Those of you who are more detail orientated will have noticed the vertical scale on our signal/distance graph 
is made up of negative numbers, which can be a bit off-putting.  
  Figure 5-14.    A drill sergeant transmits a signal at a high number of decibels with a minimum of signal 
attenuation due to the close proximity of the receiver   http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Drill_
Sergeant_Shouting_Orders_MOD_45155579.jpg  
 Bluetooth signal strength is measured in decibels, or dB for short. This unit of measure was named in 
honor of Alexander Graham Bell, the Scotsman credited with inventing the first practically used telephone, 
and whose name the Bell Telephone Company, now AT&T, adopted. A decibel is one tenth of a Bel. In 
the context of Bluetooth beacons, dB should more precisely be expressed as dBm (sometimes dBmW) or 
decibel-milliwatts.  
 It’s worth getting comfortable with this form of measurement and the strange negative numbers used to 
quantify signal strength, because a lot of the apps that measure Bluetooth beacon signals will quantify their 
measurements in dBm. 
 The key thing to remember is that more dBms mean more signal, which implies closer proximity. In the 
graph in Figure  5-13 , the strongest signal we see is -63dBm and the weakest signal is -97. 
 So when you look at your beacon measurement app, remember that -63 is a bigger number than -97, 
despite the way graphs are often plotted. 
 The values are negative because the numbers are a tiny fraction of a milliwatt. Decibels use a 
logarithmic scale where the dBm value is a power of 10. With a log 10 scale, a value of -2dBm represents 
10 to the -2 of the power we are measuring, put another way 10 -2  or 0.01. A negative dBm means that you’re 
applying a negative “exponent” or “power of” in your power calculations. -10dBm equals 0.1mW, -20dBm 
equals 0.01mW, and -30 equals, you guessed it, 0.001mW. 
 The other noteworthy implication of this is that if your signal went from -63dBm to -73dBm, the drop 
was a lot bigger than it may appear. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
43
 Calibrating Signal Strength 
 We are starting to see that there are more variables than simple proximity that affect the signal strength a 
mobile device receives from a beacon. An obvious factor to consider is the strength of the radio signal that 
is broadcast by the beacon in the first place. This can vary depending on the amount of electrical power that 
the beacon uses to broadcast via its tiny antenna. 
 Given that battery power needs to be conserved to extend the shelf life of the beacon, a beacon may 
be configured to transmit with lower power. Although this economy may not be necessary if the beacon is 
USB-powered rather than powered by a small battery. 
 The decision to reduce transmission power can be driven by factors other than battery conservation; 
factors such as the “use-case” 7 (i.e. the desired user experience) are also important considerations. Enabling 
detection of the beacon at long distances may not be necessary or desirable. For example, when a beacon 
is being used at a point of sale, where the phone will be waved over the beacon to indicate that the owner of 
the phone wants to pay with a digital wallet. Not only is the necessary range very small in this case, it may be 
that we also want to avoid the signal being detected by customers’ phones that are next to other point of sale 
terminals. 
 Another factor is the efficiency of the antenna. Antenna design is an art and a science. The size, shape, 
composition, circuitry, and location of an antenna are all factors. All beacons are not created equal in this 
respect. 
 Given that the signal strength transmitted by the beacon can vary for any number of reasons, Apple 
included a Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) parameter in the iBeacon packet that the beacon 
sends. The value of this field should be set when the beacon is deployed, based on the results of a calibration 
process that measures the strength of the signal received from one meter away. So if the beacon’s signal 
strength is reduced to save battery, the new signal should be measured as part of a calibrating process and 
the RSSI number should be reduced accordingly. In this way, beacons with different characteristics and 
from different manufacturers can be used without the variations in the signal strength causing inconsistent 
behavior in the apps being triggered by them.  
 Different Phones for Different Folks 
 One more inconsistency to beware of is that different phones report different signal strengths from the same 
beacon. This can be a function of differences in antenna and other circuitry in the phone and of the different 
techniques implemented by the firmware and operating system software to measure the signal. 
 The graph in Figure  5-15 comparing Apple’s iPhone versus the Google and Samsung Android devices 
shows different signal strengths measured from the same beacon. It also shows a difference in the consistency 
of the signal; with Google’s Nexus 4 being the least consistent at the time this analysis was done.  
 7 “A  use-case is a written description of how users will perform tasks on your web site [or mobile app]. It outlines, from a 
user’s point of view, a system’s behavior as it responds to a request. Each use-case is represented as a sequence of simple 
steps, beginning with a user’s goal and ending when that goal is fulfilled.”    www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/
methods/use-cases.html  

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
44
 There may be better alignment of the performance of these systems so the numbers become more 
similar in the future, or maybe some entrepreneur will publish information that helps software developers 
abstract the difference. In the short term the software developer can reduce the number of phones 
supported to those whose Bluetooth performance can be measured and calibrated using in-house methods, 
accept the variability in the design of their software, or be coarse-grained about the signal levels that they 
pay attention to. 
 Signal Fluctuation 
 A phenomenon that will test both the skill and sanity of the beacon software deployer is signal fluctuation. 
This is particularly vexing when the participants in the system—beacon and mobile phone—are stationary, 
but the signal is still fluctuating. This can be measured with the mobile app tools provided by beacon 
vendors, which will typically display a dynamic readout of the signal strength from the beacon. Figure  5-12 
shows the Gimbal app’s presentation of the signal strength both in terms of a color indicator and the dBm. 
The dBm number was rising and falling even when there was no movement between the beacon and the 
phone. Figure  5-16  indicates the magnitude of those fluctuations over time.

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
45
 The reason for this lack of stability is that the Bluetooth signal is subject to interference and phenomena 
like multi-pathing, where a signal from a single source can arrive via more than one path due to signals 
bouncing off other objects along the way. Occurrences of multi-pathing are not confined to Bluetooth 
signals, as it affects many other sorts of wireless signals such as LTE, where a subscriber making a call 
indoors can have the signal from the cell tower arrive via more then one route. One route might be through 
a doorway, while another might be through a window. Those two paths can actually be used to increase the 
throughput of LTE by sending additional data along the additional path. However in the case of Bluetooth 
beacons, it results in confusion, with signal strengths jumping up and down when they should be stable. 
 One way to address this issue, which is sometimes adopted by beacon manufacturers in their SDK, is to 
smooth the signal by taking samples over time and averaging the result reported to the application. Figure  5-17  
shows the effect of such an approach using a three-second smoothing window.      
 Figure 5-16.    Signal strength over time between a beacon at 10 feet and 15 feet away from a phone; 
with no smoothing, the signal fluctuates significantly

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
46
 Of course, as they say, there is no such thing as a free lunch, so there is a tradeoff in doing this 
smoothing over time. The smoothing introduces a latency that is proportionate to the time intervals over 
which the smoothing takes place. If the smoothing is done over a relatively long period of time, say ten 
seconds, then we can expect a very smooth signal, but will also have introduced an up to ten second delay 
before the signal strength can be reported. Such a delay will lose valuable responsiveness to movements that 
may be required to trigger an event such as a tap with a phone to complete a payment. 
 If you are bringing your phone into close proximity with a beacon to indicate that you want to purchase 
an item, a 10 second delay is likely to be unacceptable. So, in many instances, the smoothing window will 
need to be performed over a  shorter  period of time. 
 Advertising Frequency 
 The data that a beacon broadcasts is referred to as an advertising packet, because there is very little content 
contained in the packet. By broadcasting their UUID and major and minor device numbers, they are simply 
sending alerts to mobile applications that might be listening for them, signaling that the beacon is present. 
 A key parameter for the developer to decide on is how often the beacon should transmit its 
advertisement packet, in other words, the frequency of transmission. Mind you, this frequency typically 
ranges between once a second and ten times a second. This is not to be confused with the frequency of the 
spectrum that Bluetooth uses. You don’t have any control over that. 
 It’s worth taking a few moments to get comfortable with how this advertising frequency is described 
and what the factors are that impact the settings you might choose. This parameter impacts the uses that the 
beacon can be put to and the life of the battery. The more rapidly the beacon is set to broadcast, the faster it 
will burn through the life of its battery.  
 The frequency is often measured is in terms of milliseconds. There are 1,000 milliseconds in a second. 
So if a beacon is broadcasting 10 times a second, it can be said to be broadcasting every 100 milliseconds. 
If you set it to broadcast five times a second, it can be said to be broadcasting every 200 milliseconds, or at 
5 hertz. Figure  5-18  encapsulates a digression on the origins of that term.  
 Figure 5-17.    Signal strength over time between a beacon at 10 feet and 15 feet away from a phone; 
with smoothing enabled, the signal fluctuation is reduced

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
47
 So if increasing the frequency of broadcast depletes the life of the battery faster, why do it? There are 
a couple of good reasons. The most obvious one is that if the subject being measured is traveling at high 
speed, like kids entering a school—no, forget that, like kids  leaving a school—then there is a chance that 
a beacon broadcasting infrequently might miss registering their presence altogether. How could this be? 
Imagine a scenario in which a beacon in a child’s backpack transmits a signal to be registered by a hub near 
the entrance to the school. This hub will have a finite detection range. So if the kid happens to be running 
along the outer edges of that range, and if he is moving fast, it is entirely possible that he will pass through 
the detection area in the window between iterations of the beacon’s broadcast. Such a case would let the 
child through without being registered by the hub.  
 Alternatively, imagine we are watching Robert Mitchum in “The Enemy Below,” one of those old World 
War II movies where the destroyers are trying to hunt down the submarines using radar (similar to Figure  5-19 ). 
If the sub is far away and trying to slip past Robert Mitchum and his crew, Radarman Andrews has to 
really be paying attention, otherwise the sub may show up once on the edge of the radar screen and then 
disappear again. If the radar is scanning more frequently, Andrews is much more likely to see the sub. 
 Figure 5-18.  Heinrich Hertz 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
48
 Back to the beacons and real-life scenarios. If the kid is running and there are also other kids in the 
way, or there are walls and doors that could block the signal, then we could be in trouble if the signal isn’t 
broadcast frequently enough. 
 Other factors can cause our brief window of exposure to a beacon signature to be missed. The signal 
smoothing, for instance, may cause us to miss a brief spike in the signal, indicating the presence of the 
beacon at the periphery of our range. This is an argument for adjusting the strength of the signal transmitted 
by the beacon to the maximum, in order to extend those fleeting moments to be sustained long enough to 
persist through the smoothing process.  
 Let’s think about this issue in a shopping context. Brands may be interested in tracking whether a 
shopper has come into view of their product. They may want to check to see if a potential customer who 
can see their display is attracted by the graphic being used and walks closer, or if they are in the vicinity and 
then move away. This could provide clues about the effectiveness of the display in attracting different kinds 
of customers. We could combine demographics gathered elsewhere in the app with the proximity data, and 
might see that men are attracted by a certain display, but women of a certain age are not. 
 If the beacon isn’t broadcasting frequently, by the time we have dumbed down the fidelity of the signal 
with frequency smoothing and factored in some other issues we will cover shortly, we might entirely miss 
the presence of the fast moving shopper who was near our display and then walked away. 
 Of course it isn’t as simple as that. There is another factor: the mobile device that is scanning for the 
advertising packets doesn’t necessarily scan all the time. Phones have batteries too and if the Bluetooth 
radio on the phone were constantly scanning, that battery would be depleted pretty fast. 
 With iOS, if the process that is looking for the beacon is running in the background, the scanning 
will become less frequent. Apple doesn’t tell us how often iOS scans, but it recommends that the beacons 
broadcast 10 times a second in order for the signals to be detected reliably. If your app has control of the 
screen and is scanning for a beacon, it will generally be detected a lot more quickly than if the app is in the 
background while another app is active. 
 Figure 5-19.  An iconic representation of a signal being detected on a radar screen 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
49
 By meditating on Figure  5-20 you can see how the more frequently the beacon broadcasts, the shorter 
the window is that the handset operating system needs to scan for in order to be sure of sighting the beacon. 
In effect, we are trading the battery life of the beacon for the battery life of the phone. Frequent beacon 
broadcasts enable shorter background scans from iOS. 
 An app running in the background is like if Radarman Andrews keeps dozing off while on watch. 
He jolts awake with sudden awareness every so often, but immediately finds his eyelids growing heavy 
again, making him much less likely to detect the enemy sub on the radar screen as a result. What should 
we do to mitigate this problem? One thing would be to try to get users of the app into the foreground with 
functionality that is amusing or useful. Alternatively, we could broadcast our advertising packet more often 
(ten times a second rather than once a second) so that the beacon is more likely to be spotted when the 
operating system occasionally wakes the process up to check for beacons. 
 Lastly, if we increase the frequency of broadcast then this provides more data for the signal smoothing 
that we described earlier to operate on, so the accuracy and consistency of the signal can be increased.  
 Region Monitoring 
 By this point in the chapter it’s probably become clear that, while Bluetooth beacons have some exciting 
properties, centimeter accuracy across all distances is not one of them. To accommodate that reality, Apple 
developed a model for alerting apps based on a much coarser grain measure of proximity. When an iOS 
app wants to be notified of the proximity of a beacon, it gets to monitor four regions: Immediate, Near, Far, 
and Unknown. If an app says, “Alert me if I’m in the immediate proximity of a beacon with the UUID x,” this 
corresponds to a proximity of half a meter or less; Near corresponds to 2 meters, and Far corresponds to up 
to 30 meters away. Unknown is exactly that: we think a beacon with a desired UUID is there, but the errors 
from the packets don’t give us a clear sense of how close the beacon is, so it’s probably not very close. 
 In the Apple documentation, these regions are presented in a diagram that makes them seem 
comparable in size. Figure  5-21 is drawn to scale so you can see that this isn’t the case. 
 Figure 5-20.    Beacon advertising intervals coinciding with scans from a phone       
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
50
 When an app has iOS monitoring regions, a hollow blue arrow will be displayed in the status bar to 
indicate that some additional battery resources are being consumed, in order to be transparent to the user 
about what is going on. This is the right thing to do, given region monitoring has both privacy and battery 
life implications.  
 Ranging 
 Ranging is a much more energy-consuming operation, which is generally only allowed when an app is in 
the foreground, or for a few seconds when a background process has been alerted to entry into a new region. 
Ranging involves the ongoing monitoring of signal strength in decibels. This allows the app to go beyond the 
very coarse measure of Immediate, Near, and Far regions and apply logic to translate a given signal strength 
to a given distance. iOS displays a solid blue arrow in the status bar to indicate that this more battery hungry 
form of activity is taking place.  
 Applications that want to do ranging on an ongoing basis when running in the background will need 
to explicitly request that ability from Apple (in what’s called a “plist” file) and will be regarded with some 
skepticism when going through the approval process in order to get into the App Store. Apple will want to 
see a compelling reason for consuming those resources before the app will be approved.  
 Trilateration 
 One of the approaches to measuring proximity more accurately, beyond applying an average over time, is to 
look for multiple beacon signals. For instance, there may be beacons in three or more corners of a room, and 
a mobile device can pick up signals from all of them. This is sometimes referred to as triangulation or, more 
correctly,  trilateration.  
 Figure 5-21.    Relative distance of the regions that iOS monitors       
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
51
 Trilateration is the process of determining absolute or relative locations of points by measurement 
of distances, using the geometry of circles. By combining the signal strength from beacons A, B, and C, as 
shown in Figure  5-22 , we can get a more accurate sense of the user’s proximity to each beacon. We can also 
plot its position on an X and Y axis. In its description of the role of beacons, Apple has designated their use 
only for proximity (understanding how close a phone is to another object), whereas Wi-Fi would be used for 
positioning (understanding the longitude and latitude of the phone). This is an artificial distinction.  
 As of writing this, the Apple APIs are engineered around the proximity use-case, but through the use 
of ranging and additional software to do the trilateration geometry, beacons can be used for positioning as 
well. This allows phones to display the user’s position relative to a floor plan. 
 This can be a useful way of guiding a shopper around the store. However, it adds significant complexity 
to the developer’s app and the operational complexity, both of which will increase cost. The location of 
each beacon needs to be recorded relative to a floor plan, which in turn needs to be anchored to a latitude-
longitude position, requiring a lot of extra effort. The deployment of beacons for exact location positioning 
requires an investment in staffing that will be significant when deciding if the approach is economically 
viable. It’s probably not practical to just mail the beacon to employees in a given branch with instructions 
to place it behind a certain display. Trilateration will likely require a team familiar with the dynamics of 
the technology to be dispatched to obtain or create a floor plan, record X, Y, and Z coordinates (latitude, 
longitude, and height), place the beacons accordingly, and enter that information in an appropriate system. 
Not the kind of thing store managers across, for instance, a large chain of fast food restaurants can be 
relied on to do. At least, not without a lot of guidance, support, and training. If you as a solution architect 
who decides that you need to use multiple beacons, either to achieve greater accuracy in your proximity 
measurement, or because you want to do positioning, the system complexity can be outsourced to vendors 
such as indoo.rs and Point Inside, which provide the software tools to perform trilateration and management 
of the floor plans.  
 Other middleware vendors, such as the providers of the mobile app BlindSquare, have developed a 
rules engine that infers the location of the user by using the relative position of beacons. This approach 
may not yield an exact X/Y location, but the system is remarkably effective. It uses movement relative to the 
beacons to trigger audio directions to the user. The BlindSquare app provides information to blind people

OTHER WAYS OF CALCULATING INDOOR LOCATION
 It would be possible for Bluetooth technology to evolve and enable more accurate calculation of where 
the blue dot should be displayed on a floor plan. It wouldn’t be surprising to see these techniques, which 
have been used with other wireless technologies, to appear as new features in future versions of the 
Bluetooth standard. 
 Round trip time (RTT) substitutes a measurement of the time it takes for packets to be sent from 
transmitter and receiver for the current signal strength measurement we use with Bluetooth 4.0. This is 
more accurate but is likely to introduce additional cost to the beacon hardware. 
 Angle of arrival builds on this idea by comparing the timing of packets delivered from different nodes in 
an antenna array. 
 Rather than plotting the longitude and latitude of a user, some applications are focused on establishing 
the relationship between that user and a given product. This could be in order to guide them to it, to see 
if the packaging has attracted them to it, or to see if a coupon delivered earlier has resulted in a visit to the 
product on the shelf. To achieve this, other data sets are required, specifically  planograms . Planograms and 
other inventory databases record the position of specific products on a shelf and are maintained by the 
merchandising teams of larger  merchants trying to organize and optimize placement of products across 
their stores. 
 Use of UUIDs and the 20 Region Limit 
 iOS limits the number of regions that an application can monitor to 20. A  region  can be a latitude and 
longitude that is tracked primarily by GPS, or it can be a UUID that the operating system is looking out for. 
Given that thousands of beacons can share the same UUID, 20 isn’t a major limitation, but it’s important to 
understand in order to organize the identification of your beacons so that your system can scale. 
 If a shopping app, say, is going to work across a large number of different retailers, then those retailers 
either need to agree that they will use the same UUID, or the app needs to get more sophisticated about 
rotating UUIDs in and out of the set of 20 that it asks iOS to look out for. This could be done based on an 
algorithm that anticipates the stores that a shopper is likely to see based on their GPS coordinates. 
 For example, if there is a region that encompasses the west wing of a shopping mall that has 20 retailers, 
each with their own beacons, then the app will want to have iOS look for one set of UUIDs. As the shopper 
gets closer to the east wing of the mall, the set of UUIDs will need to be swapped out for a different set, ones 
that will correspond to what the shopper may see in the other half of the mall. Like trilateration, this kind of 
UUID management can be delegated to third-party software. 
 We have focused on Apple’s iBeacon but despite its strength in the U.S. market, over half of the 
smartphone devices in the rest of the world run Google’s Android operating system. Therefore, the next 
section will look at a beacon API standard that works on this alternative OS. 
 AltBeacon: An Open Source Standard 
 by David G. Young, Chief Engineer, Radius Networks, Inc. 
 The  AltBeacon standard (Figure  5-23 ) is an open source variant that came in response to iBeacon 
technology. Because Apple’s iBeacon is proprietary, the company can impose limits on how it is used by others. 
Apple sees iBeacon as something that only iOS devices (iPhones, iPads, and iPod touch devices) are allowed to 
use and enforces this through its iBeacon certification program. This leaves Android devices in the cold.  

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
53
 While many people use iBeacon technology on Android devices despite these restrictions, Apple’s 
proprietary approach inspired Radius Networks to create the open AltBeacon standard. 
 Unlike iBeacon, AltBeacon comes with an open source license, open source code for using it on 
Android, Windows, and Linux platforms, and detailed open documentation so there is no mystery about 
how it works.  
 AltBeacon defines a Bluetooth transmission packet that is different from iBeacon but works the same 
way, creating interoperability. While supporting a variety of identifier formats, AltBeacon is typically used 
with a three-part identifier with the same byte lengths as those used on iBeacon. Whereas iBeacon defines 
a proximity UUIDs and major and minor numbers, with AltBeacon you use Id1, Id2, and Id3, which work 
exactly the same way. 
 This provides a way to build a system based on iBeacons and extend it to Android and other platforms 
besides iOS without violating Apple’s intellectual property terms. Most usage is on Android with the open 
source Android Beacon Library, which provides Android apps with the equivalent beacon functionality that 
is built into iOS. 
 Because AltBeacon is a different transmission format from iBeacon, systems using iBeacon on iOS and 
AltBeacon on Android typically use what’s called an interleaving beacon. This is a beacon that sends out two 
different formats in a single package. Radius Networks’ RadBeacon product line puts out transmissions with 
both the iBeacon and AltBeacon format. Instead of just sending out an iBeacon packet ten times per second, 
these products alternate between sending out an iBeacon packet and an AltBeacon packet, sending 20 
packets per second, one for each packet type. The end result is applications that work cross-platform without 
intellectual property concerns. 
 The Locate app shown in Figure  5-24 can identify beacons broadcasting iBeacon and AltBeacon 
protocol packet or frame types.  
 Figure 5-23.  The AltBeacon logo 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
54
 While its open nature is AltBeacon’s primary draw, its toolset provides some significant advantages on 
the Android platform versus iBeacons on the iOS platform. Working with iBeacons can be frustrating, in part 
because the closed system documentation is vague. Developers often have to study and reverse-engineer the 
iBeacon APIs on iOS in order to figure out how they work in specific situations. How long does it take to detect 
an iBeacon transmission when an app is in the background? When ranging for beacons, what is the averaging 
interval for the distance estimates? Nobody knows the answer to these questions for sure, and Apple won’t say. 
 With AltBeacon and the Android Beacon Library, there are no mysteries. The answers are fully 
documented, and the source code is there for everybody to see.  
 This open nature lends itself to great flexibility. The Android Beacon Library lets you decode a wide variety 
of beacons (even proprietary ones like iBeacon) if you provide it with the format. It then allows you to detect any 
beacon even if you don’t know its proximity UUID up front. This is something that iOS won’t let you do; it only lets 
you see your own beacons or those whose identifiers you know up front. The Locate Beacon app for Android is 
based on this technology and demonstrates this ability. Going further, it can even report the location of beacons it 
discovers to an online database called  WikiBeacon.org , which maps known locations of beacons worldwide. 
 The Android platform lets you do other interesting things with beacons that iOS does not. On Android, an 
app can continuously range for beacons in the background, allowing an app to spring to life when the phone is 
a specific distance from a beacon. And unlike iOS, an app can launch itself to a full screen view on these events. 
 With the release of Android 5, apps can also transmit as beacons, even when in the background. This 
makes Android 5 tablets an alternative to physical beacons for retail and other applications where tablets are 
present anyway. Simply turn on a free transmitter app (such as Locate Beacon) in the background and go 
about your business.

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
55
 While most of its use is on Android, AltBeacon is a cross-platform standard. Implementations exist 
on Linux, and small Raspberry Pi computers are sometimes used as beacon transmitters and detectors. 
A Windows Beacon Library is available in pre-release and will allow detection of beacons with the release 
of Windows 10, which is the first Windows version with full Bluetooth low-energy support.  
 Google’s Eddystone 
 Two years after Apple launched iBeacon, Google was missing from the beacon battlefield. At a time when 
Android enjoyed a 78% 8 share of the smartphone market globally, the lack of any formal endorsement of the 
beacon paradigm from Google raised doubts as to whether beacons were here to stay. In the United States, 
Android’s market share was more evenly balanced at 53.1% versus iOS at 41.6% 9 . This combined with the 
fact that iPhones tended to be  adoption by more wealthy users and Apple’s prestige among retailers allowed 
brands and agencies to ignore Google’s absence and to adopt an Apple-only solution. To fill the void, beacon 
vendors provided their own Android APIs as a stopgap. 
 
EDDYSTONE LIGHTHOUSE
 The lighthouse is a great metaphor for the way Bluetooth beacons work. They broadcast their signal 
without any connection and offer a scalable way of alerting people to their proximity. 
 Eddystone Lighthouse is not to be confused with Edison Lighthouse, the one-hit wonder group that 
enjoyed Top 10 popularity in 1970 with “Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)”. The group were 
named after the lighthouse, but were a lot less durable. 
 The name is said to derive from “stone of the eddies” or turbulent water. Many (but not all) British 
people pronounce it as “ediston”. 
 If Eddystone Lighthouse was a software project, it would be version 4.0. 
 Version 1.0 was built in 1698. When Louis XIV heard that one of his men had taken the builder prisoner, 
he is said to have ordered his release with the phrase, “France is at war with England, not with 
humanity”. Alas, the tower and its builder were swept away in a storm five years after it was built. 
 Version 2.0 was made of wood and burnt down. Version 3.0 started to wobble and was moved to the 
main land preemptively. The stump remains, next to 4.0, which was constructed in 1880. It is now 
unmanned and has a helipad on its roof to enable maintenance. 
 What Was Google Up To? 
 There were rumors that Google was going to do something. Beacon manufacturers had been receiving 
orders for large numbers of beacons from different groups within the Googleplex, but there had been no 
beacon announcements during the two Google I/O developer conferences following Apple’s announcement. 
Beacon manufacturers’ own libraries allowed Android smartphones to respond to the same beacons used to

trigger apps on iOS. However, these lacked some of the core OS support that enabled more efficient scanning 
of beacons in the background. Google’s Bluetooth stack improved in 5.0 of Android to fill this gap, but there 
was still no endorsement from Google or integration with other parts of the Android OS. 
 There was one interesting initiative that could be attributed to Google. Scott Jensen, a Google user 
experience expert, had left Google, worked at Frog Design, one of the Bay Areas’ leading agencies, and 
returned to initiate an open source project called  “The Physical Web” . This defined a standard for UriBeacons 
that broadcast URLs to browser apps. It relied on users taking the initiative to browse these URLs when 
they wanted to interact with objects or appliances in the Physical Web. This was a very different approach 
to iBeacons that could trigger actions in a broad variety of apps with no user intervention. The fact that this 
wasn’t an officially endorsed project by Google and there were no hooks into Android, or its apps such as 
 Chrome  , contributed to an air of uncertainty about the project. 
 On the other hand, when analyzing the opportunity, Google seemed, if anything, to be better placed to 
capitalize on the Bluetooth beacon trend. Surely the largest provider of web and mobile advertising services 
could monetize the ability to better target mobile ads and use beacons for attribution, in other words to 
measure the effectiveness of those ads. As the leader in maps, surely Google could benefit from being able to 
enhance the ability to map indoor locations. In retrospect, the obvious answer was that it could indeed. 
 On July 14 2015, the uncertainty ended. Google saw Apple’s bet on Bluetooth beacons and raised the 
stakes with a mountain of chips that dwarfed the original iBeacon specification. Their beacon offering was 
named Eddystone, after the first offshore lighthouse in the world, situated in the English Channel, 13 miles 
south west of Plymouth. Their announcement included not just commitments to support from third-party 
beacon manufacturers, but shipping products from six major producers of hardware (Bkon, Bluevision, 
Estimote, Kontakt.io, Radius Networks, and Signal 360). 
 Apple’s iBeacon  approach   had been minimalist, with just enough technology to provide the foundations 
for the ecosystem and convey the possibilities of beacon use-cases. Apple left lots of space for third parties to 
fill in the gaps. Google, on the other hand, studied the ecosystem created by Apple and identified interesting 
gaps that could be filled. As a result, Eddystone provides a more comprehensive foundation, while also 
cherry-picking some additional lucrative areas beyond that basic OS foundation that would benefit their 
business. 
 Google has tried to contrast its approach to beacons by positioning it as being more open than Apple’s. 
Rather than secret specifications for Beacon OEMs secured by non-disclosure agreements, Google has made 
the protocol a GitHub open source project. The Eddystone protocol specification is there for all to see, but 
rather like Android, it maintains control of the open source project through proprietary apps and services. 
 Another major contrast is that Google provides support for its competitor’s operating system (iOS) as 
well as its own (Android). 
 Eddystone Components 
 Eddystone consists of four layers of functionality:
• 
 The  Eddystone Protocol —The packet or frame types that Eddystone beacons send 
• 
 OS Support, Widgets, and APIs —The root of the power and control for the OS 
provider 
• 
 Fleet Management and Registry —The foundation of tracking the location, metadata, and 
health of beacons, a component absent from iBeacon that is a major source of value  
• 
 Integration with Google Apps —“Eating your own dog food,” Google’s iOS and 
Android apps that use these components 
 Let’s examine these components in more detail. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
57
 The Eddystone Protocol 
 An Eddystone Bluetooth beacon can broadcast four beacon packet types. These are also referred to as 
“frames” in the  Eddystone Protocol Specification 10 .
• 
 Eddystone-UID (Unique ID) 
• 
 Eddystone-TLM (Telemetry) 
• 
 Eddystone-URL (Uniform Resource Locator) 
• 
 Eddystone-EID (Ephemeral Identifiers) 
 Eddystone-UID 
 Of the three  types of Eddystone frame , this is the one that directly corresponds to the functionality of Apple’s 
iBeacon 1.0 packet. It’s used to trigger actions in mobile apps that are running in the foreground or background. 
 While the format is similar to iBeacon, the details of its structure differ sufficiently that the two are 
not compatible. An iBeacon device can’t trigger an Eddystone app and a beacon that is only broadcasting 
to the Eddystone specification can’t trigger an iBeacon app. Beacons need to broadcast both iBeacon and 
Eddystone-UID frames if they are to trigger actions in both iBeacon and Eddystone apps.
 Tx Power 
 As with iBeacon, Eddystone-UID frames contain a field to allow the calibration of the signal strength that 
the beacon is using to broadcast. This field contains the signal strength measured from the beacon at zero 
meters, whereas iBeacons are calibrated at distance of one meter. This value can range from -100dBm up to 
+20dBm.
 UID 
 Eddystone-UID packets contain a 10-byte UUID that identifies a group of beacons. This corresponds to the 
iBeacon UUID only it’s six bytes shorter. 
 Google recommend two ways of generating the UID. One is to take the UUID used for the 
corresponding iBeacon and remove bytes 5 through 10. Alternatively, Google suggests a transformation of 
the owner’s alphanumeric domain name, using a hash algorithm, to create the hexadecimal UID. 
 Like iBeacon, Eddystone apps can filter the callbacks they receive to wake themselves up using this number, 
so that unrelated beacons do not trigger the app and waste CPU cycles and battery power on the phone.
 Instance ID 
 The Instance ID identifies the beacon within the UID group. For example, the instance ID might identify the 
store where the particular beacon is located. iBeacons uses two numbers to do this, the major and minor 
device number. The six bytes available (two more than provided by Apple’s major and minor numbers 
combined) allow for ample space to construct the kind of hierarchies required to map the beacons within 
an organization. For example, the first two bytes (ranging in value from 0 to 65,536) might map to the store 
number; the next two bytes could be used to represent the department in the store; and the last two could 
identify the logical position within the department, e.g., a point of sale position.

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
58
 Eddystone-EID 
 We will discuss the  EID (Ephemeral ID) next as it is a variation of UID, in that it triggers actions in apps. 
The difference being that it does so in a way that supports more privacy and security safeguards than UID. 
 In our discussion of iBeacon, we explored the issues with piggybacking and spoofing. When a beacon 
broadcasts a static identifier, this opens up the possibility that others will record and map these and use 
them for their own purposes or even rebroadcast and forge the identity of the beacon. 
 Google changes the MAC address and the ID of an ephemeral frame on a regular basis 11  in ways that 
can only be deciphered by authorized entities, so that unauthorized third parties can’t spoof or piggyback. 
 This capability to obfuscate the ID of a beacon used to be an unusual feature offered only by a handful 
of beacon vendors such as Gimbal, Swirl, Shopkick, and inMarket. Now it has become quite a common 
feature. The issue is that the approach to doing this differs between each vendor, thus making the hardware 
proprietary and eliminating the promise of interoperability, which is fundamental to iBeacon. The vendors 
advertise they support iBeacon but since iBeacon doesn’t address this area, they are bound to make their 
beacons incompatible with the applications developed for the other vendor’s product. 
 This isn’t healthy for customers deploying such systems. They become locked into one vendor’s 
protocol. This also fragments the application ecosystem, increasing porting costs and limiting choice. 
 For venue owners that invest in iBeacons, it also means that if they wanted iOS apps such as Passbook 
or Wallet to work with their beacons, they couldn’t use rotation of the UUID if they want Passbook/Wallet to 
detect the beacons. 
 Eddystone-EID  promises to eliminate this unpalatable choice between security and standardization. 
 The EID feature underpins the control of who can access a beacon and when, which is fundamental to 
a number of very significant approaches to monetizing beacons. We will explore this important topic further 
in the chapter that covers beacon networks. 
 Eddystone-TLM 
 Management of beacons is another area where beacon manufacturers have had to step in with proprietary 
methods to monitor the health of the beacons they produce.  Eddystone-TLM (telemetry) offers a 
standardized way for beacons to report battery level, temperature, and the time since power-on or reboot. 
 Google leaves it up to the OEM to regulate how often the frames are broadcast. The TLM packets are 
supposed to be interleaved with the other packet types that identify the beacon (UID, EID and URL). Since 
TLM broadcasts consume power, the frames can be sent quite infrequently. If the beacon will be seen by 
apps frequently, these broadcasts can be sent less often. Conversely, if the beacon will not be sighted very 
often, the frequency of TLM broadcasts needs to be increased. 
 Apps may use an API to relay the telemetry reported in TLM frames to Google’s beacon platform. The 
platform will then analyze the information and predict when the battery will expire, when the beacon has 
been moved from its registered location and unexpected changes in how often the beacon is being detected 
(that might indicate problems with the beacon). This analysis is reported via an API ( beacons.diagnostics ). 
 Eddystone-URL 
 Eddystone-URL frames include a field to calibrate the power at which the beacon transmits. This works the 
same way as with Eddystone-URI. The next field is a compressed URL up to 17 bytes in length, for example 
  https://goo.gl/Aq18zF . Any URL compression service can be used, including Google’s own URL shortener 
  https://goo.gl . 
 11 Typically, EIDs changes pseudo-randomly every 8.5 seconds, although this is configurable and varies slightly in order 
to enhance security. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
59
 Eddystone-URL beacons can be configured using a configuration service that allows beacon URLs to 
be modified, the frequency of broadcast to be adjusted, and a lock code that secures future changes to the 
beacon. The beacon enters the configuration mode when power is cycled or a physical configuration button 
is activated. This button can be physically secured within the case of the beacon. 
 We will explore the important strategic implications of Eddystone-URL more fully later in this chapter.   
 Management and Registry 
 While iBeacon 1.0 leaves the management of beacons to the developer, Eddystone provides important 
foundational elements to support the registration and monitoring of beacons.
• 
 Proximity Beacon API —The Proximity Beacon API allows a beacon to be registered 
with Google’s beacon cloud service, recording metadata about the beacon such as 
its location (indoor floor level, longitude, and latitude) and “attachments” that are 
stored in Google’s cloud. Attachments can be arbitrary in their structure but are 
limited to 1024 bytes in length, so media objects such as images and video would 
need to be stored in a parallel structure. These attachments can be served only to 
those of the same Google Developer Console project. 
• 
 Place ID—When a beacon location is registered, a  Google Place ID can be associated 
with the beacon and it improves the accuracy of the Google Place Picker widget, 
which is used by third-party apps and Google apps such as Google Maps to display 
map information about points of interest. Prior to the launch of Eddystone, Apple 
had not integrated iBeacons into its own Maps product but subsequent to Google’s 
initiative, they appear to be doing so. 
• 
 Registry and Monitoring —In addition to registering Eddystone beacons, the 
Proximity Beacon API can be used to register and track AltBeacons and iBeacons. 
This is either very helpful, or cunning, depending on your perspective. Whereas 
Apple has avoided supporting competitive beacon technology, Google’s approach 
is to encapsulate it into its own ecosystem. Venue owners such as retailers have 
expressed reservations about registering details of all of their beacons with Google. 
 Once a beacon is registered, another API ( beacons.diagnostics ) can be used to monitor when the 
beacon battery is likely to expire and whether the beacon may have been moved.  
 Nearby Messages API 
 The  Nearby Messages API is Google’s recommended method to receive notifications when a beacon is 
sighted. It works across Android and iOS operating systems. In addition to subscribing to notifications about 
nearby beacons, the API can be used to subscribe to proximity notifications based on audio signals and 
Wi-Fi. Filtering just on Bluetooth beacons increases the responsiveness of the notification. 
 Google Apps 
 In addition to using beacons to enable better indoor navigation in Google Maps, Google’s personal assistant 
app, Google Now, will use Eddystone beacons to order the cards that it displays to provide contextually 
relevant information. These cards could correspond to exhibits in a museum, information on exercise 
machines at a gym, or a menu at a restaurant or a bar.

 AltBeacon’s Role in a Beacosystem with Eddystone 
 by David G. Young, Chief Engineer, Radius Networks, Inc. 
 Eddystone and  AltBeacon perform two different roles on Android. A key feature of AltBeacon is that it 
is interoperable with iBeacon, specifically allowing developers to use the same beacon identifier scheme on 
Android as they are using on iOS. Because Eddystone does not use the same identifier size (the Eddystone-
UID identifier is only a total of only 16 bytes versus 20 bytes for iBeacon and AltBeacon), the same identifiers 
cannot be used. For solution designers who want to use Eddystone on both iOS and Android this does 
not pose a problem. But for folks who want to use iBeacon with iOS and have the same solution work on 
Android, AltBeacon solves the problem. 
 While Eddystone can work on iOS in some use-cases, use-cases requiring fast background detection 
will need to use iBeacon. This is because Apple has optimized this with hardware-accelerated  Bluetooth LE 
packet detection  for iBeacon that is not available for other beacon types. For such use-cases, Radius expects 
solution designers to continue to choose an iBeacon/AltBeacon combination and not Eddystone.    
 Eddystone URL and the Physical Web 
 This section is based on an article originally published in  GPS Business News. 
 The browser model of the Physical Web (Figure  5-25 ) and the Eddystone URL protocol that forms its 
foundation could prove to be bigger than the app-centric model of iBeacon in its disruptive role. Let’s explore 
why that is, how Eddystone URL beacons work, and what to expect when you browse the Physical Web.  
 Figure 5-25.  A tube of three Blesh  Physical Web beacons 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
61
 The Myth of the Long Tail 
 The target market for the Physical Web is any and all organizations that don’t have the resources, skills, 
market position, and luck to develop a very successful app. That would be most organizations. 
 The success of iBeacon is predicated on the success of mobile apps. iBeacons require beacon-aware 
apps to receive their UUID and major and minor device numbers. With all those apps in the app stores, that 
seems like a fairly safe bet. 
 However, the painful truth is that the vast majority of apps are financial failures. Gartner calculated 
that less than 0.01 percent of consumer mobile apps would be considered a financial success by their 
developers 12 . Developing a successful major app is like making a major movie: very difficult and very 
expensive. Most of us only use a handful of apps regularly and with well over a million apps each on the 
Android and Apple stores, competition is fierce. That’s not to say that you can’t make money with apps. You 
can. Big money even. But truth be told, the chances are that it won’t be you or me who hits the jackpot. 
 Is it un-American to talk like this? After all, our society is largely founded on the idea that anyone can be 
president, be a movie star, or sing to a billion people during the Super Bowl halftime show. Be that as it may, 
there’s no denying that most of us don’t get to put our feet up in the Oval office or win an Oscar, let alone 
fly from a wire around the University of Phoenix stadium with fireworks exploding around us. The most 
fortunate one percent isn’t just a political issue, it’s also the way it is in the world of mobile apps. Fortunately, 
as Americans, we don’t let logic get in the way of ambition, so there is very little chance that people will 
give up innovating and publishing apps, or hitchhiking to Hollywood to start their movie careers. We will 
continue to have the best looking waiters and waitresses in LA for some time to come. 
 The exciting thing about Physical Web beacons is that you don’t need to be able to write an app to use 
one. With Eddystone  URL , you push a button to get a beacon into setup mode, copy and paste the URL that 
you want it to broadcast, and the job is done. This is a 10-minute task for a first time user, rather than the 
weeks and months that are required to write a mobile app. 
 The Physical Web Experience Is Different 
 Rather than triggering behavior in custom apps that may be running in the background, Eddystone URL 
broadcasts short web  URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) that can be browsed by a general-purpose 
browser working in the foreground. Eddystone URL relies on more of a pull from the user, scanning their 
environment rather than the push of an alert from the beacon to user who is not seeing that interaction. 
 The idea is that this interaction will be enabled by ubiquitous apps like the browser. As part of Google’s 
Eddystone, the  Google Chrome browser is becoming Eddystone URL-aware. The first step to that browser 
integration has taken place not on Android, but in Google Chrome for iOS. As you can see in Figure  5-26 , 
the Chrome “Today Widget” (which can be accessed by swiping down from the top of the screen) has a 
Physical Web component that displays the URLs broadcast from surrounding beacons. In this case the 
URLs being broadcast are    www.thegoodtraveler.org/#2  and  google.github.io/uribeacon . Subsequent 
to the iOS release, Chrome on Android added support for the Physical Web, as did Opera with the addition 
of a “Nearby” tab, which shows which beacons are close to you. Another alternative to Chrome is for users 
to download the Physical Web browser app from the app store or one of the many variants of that browser 
provided by beacon OEMs.

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
62
 Eddystone URL is not about replacing iBeacon or Eddystone-UID; it’s a complementary tool set. 
Preinstalled apps like  Apple Pay/Wallet will leverage beacons more and more as we close the loop between 
promotions and purchases. For many very successful apps like Facebook, OpenTable, and Shazam and for 
games that don’t translate to the browse environment, the iBeacon app-centric model makes sense. They 
have broad adoption and can benefit from being able to respond to beacon triggers in the background. It 
makes sense for Walmart and Target to invest in their own apps, but we know that it doesn’t for the other 
99% of retailers. 
 For enterprises that can afford a web site but can’t afford a mobile app, Eddystone URL brings them 
the benefits of  digital-to-physical convergence . We should expect tools like WordPress and Adobe Creative 
Suite to extend the web publishing system to cater to Eddystone URL. These offerings are in a position to 
tie Physical Web into the digital web publishing tools with which millions of content producers are already 
familiar. 
 The Physical Web is an open source project. Visit the GitHub site 13 , where you can see who is working 
on it and see the specification of the  Bluetooth packet structure  . They have published Android and iOS 
Physical Web browsers that can also configure the beacons.

 Deploying a Physical Web Beacon 
 One of the most exciting things is that there is so little to do in order to take the first steps. Copy and paste 
the URL from your existing mobile site into the Physical Web setup tool and you are good to go. From a 
business perspective, if a new technology can augment an existing ecosystem and make it better, its chances 
of success are clearly a lot better than one that requires extensive retooling. 
 Let’s get to some specifics of how this works at the moment. 
 Step 1: Buy a Physical Web Beacon 
 While most of the major beacon vendors now support the Physical Web as an option, a Turkish vendor called 
 Blesh was one of the first to ship a product. Its packaging consisted of a cardboard tube to ship the beacons 
(see Figure  5-27 ), which added to the novelty. 
 Figure 5-27.  Blesh beacons unboxed 
 When you start up the Physical Web browser, you see the beacons as something that looks like a Google 
search listing, with the page title, URL, and the abstract (which a web page has encoded for search engine 
optimization). It appears that this metadata is pulled from the Google search catalog. When you update the 
description for a site in the HTML of the page, the change isn’t immediately reflected in the listing that the 
app displays. 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS

 The device is then enabled and the Physical Web browser can be used to update the URL the beacon 
broadcasts (see Figure  5-29 ).

 Step 2: Assign a URL 
 To change the URL that the beacon transmits, you press a reset button on the beacon. With the first Blesh 
beacons, a screwdriver was required to open the beacon and access that reset button (see Figure  5-28 ).

 In order to replicate what a venue such as an airport might want to do, you could simply copy and paste 
a URL to a YouTube video that explains the background to a piece of artwork on display (see Figure  5-30 ). 
To continue the “airport guide” use-case, include the URL to flight information to be broadcast near to the 
display flight boards. Then include a URL to a book that may be on sale at the airport bookstore.

 Step 3: That’s It 
 The procedure is that simple. 
 In the case of this example, there are additional parameters that allow you to adjust the standard 
advertising interval, the signal strength broadcast at various configuration levels (High, Medium, Low, and 
Lowest), and the ability to password-protect any changes to the configuration.   
 Links to  Media and Devices 
 You can see how the search results shown in Figure  5-31 could provide a jumping off point to a wealth of 
information, media, and rich interactive content in the same way the Google results page does today. 
 Figure 5-30.    The generic Physical Web app simply also allows the beacon’s URL to be set 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS

 Figure 5-31.    The GitHub Physical Web app displays the metadata from three Blesh Physical Web beacons 
 However, these links can open up more than media; they can invoke interactive web-based services 
with devices such as thermostats,  vending machines, gas pumps, microwaves, door locks, hot tubs, … the 
possibilities are enormous. 
 Critical Success Factors 
 For Google this makes complete sense. Not only will its ads be on the landing pages which will get viewed 
more often, but there are opportunities to increase the click-through rate and  “Cost Per Click”   that it charges 
because these ads are now potentially more relevant. 
 You can also imagine that the Physical Web could be used to extend the AdSense model. The current 
 AdSense model   allows site developers to get a revenue share from Google in return for making space on 
their pages for Google ads to be displayed. Why not apply the same revenue-sharing model to Physical Web 
Beacons? The landing pages the URLs point to could contain ads. In the case of a beacon in a vending machine, 
Google can keep track of the context of the beacons that are registered using its  Proximity beacon API  . 
 The context in this case is the fact it is in a vending machine that stocks snacks. Frito-Lay could pay to 
access all Physical Web Beacons in such vending machines and bid to promote their products right at the 
point of purchase. Hershey’s, PepsiCo, and Frito-Lay could bid for their ad to show up as you approach the 
vending machine. 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
68
 Strategically, Physical Web Beacon and the Proximity beacon API opens up the possibility for Google 
to build and apply their own content framework in this intersection of the digital and physical worlds, 
monetizing it with more effective advertising. 
 An “Opportunity” for Beacon Vendors? 
 What should all the Beacon vendors that jumped on the Apple iBeacon bandwagon do? Should they support 
the Eddystone URL Physical Web paradigm? They already have too much to do just keeping up with the 
changes pushed on them by the OS vendors as new point releases of their operating systems come out, plus 
they have to build out their management, analytics, and partner programs. Physical Web could be a major 
distraction, a resource sink, fragmenting the beacosystem. 
 No, Physical Web is more than likely going to be a plus for the major beacon manufacturers. Engaging 
users by browsing their physical environment is a sensible way to entice them to download a mobile app. 
Given that web pages are an order of magnitude lower in cost and quicker to develop, a lot more business 
owners are likely to move forward with projects. Physical Web means your  TAM (Total Addressable Market) 
just grew by an order of magnitude. And if your TAM just got multiplied by 10, that means your valuation 
just got a lot bigger too. Exciting? Well, not if adding support requires more resources than you have. Then 
Physical Web just becomes another major risk in your business plan. 
 Fortunately the major beacon vendors have already gotten used to accommodating multiple beacon 
standards within a single unit. As we discussed earlier in this chapter, many of them are already sending out 
iBeacon packets, with their own proprietary packets piggybacked on the tail of iBeacon data. So if you are a 
beacon vendor already broadcasting two kinds of packets, why not add more? 
 One reason not to is that, when you broadcast more data you use up more power. So if you increase 
the packet broadcast by 50%, your battery life just got correspondingly shorter. Fortunately  UriBeacon only 
broadcasts once a second. Remember the use-case is a pull model where the browser is in the foreground, 
so the issues of trying to catch the attention of the OS by broadcasting at the iBeacon prescribed rate of ten 
times a second don’t apply. Therefore, the tax on the battery in order to support Physical Web is of the order 
of 10% more; probably worth it given the value to the beacon vendor. 
 What About Apple? 
 If this such a good idea for Google, it would seem that Apple’s instinctive reaction would be to try to 
undermine the adoption of Physical Web. So far they have not done that. The Physical Web apps have even 
been allowed onto the iOS App Store. The iOS version of  Chrome supports Physical Web. When you speak to 
the Physical Web team, they are very careful not to position this as an Eddystone URL versus iBeacon horse 
race. Positioning Eddystone as open source is smart, but it’s still a Google-owned open source project. 
 Hopefully economics, the good of the users, and common sense will prevail. Enabling the same 
cool experiences on iPhone as will be available on Android makes sense for Apple. Google is not the only 
company with an ad business. Apple’s iAd is focused on in-app advertising, but when you have a market as 
big as the Physical Web, it would make sense for Apple to see that “a rising tide lifts all boats.”  
 Filtering, Ordering, Prioritizing, Personalizing, and Anticipating 
 Today, some beacon browser apps order the Physical Web listings based on the strength of the signals being 
received from the beacons. So the closer the beacon, the stronger the signal, and the higher in the ranking 
the beacon is likely to be. You can play a shell game experiment, reordering three Physical Web beacons that 
are lined up, two feet apart with a phone running the beacon browser app next to the third beacon. It takes 
about three seconds for the beacon browser to detect the changes, reordering the beacon information on the 
screen to correspond with the change in relative position of the beacons as you moved them around. There’s 
a scam that could be designed around that if you were unscrupulously minded. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS

 What is it that makes Amazon and Google so great to use, beyond the fact they have vast coverage of 
things you are interested in? The “paradox of choice” means that while we all want more, we can easily be 
overwhelmed. How often have we looked at the hundreds of TV channels on cable and thought “There is 
nothing on!”? Amazon and Google are great at surfacing relevant content in a sea of choices. 
 If the Physical Web reaches its potential, the sea of location-specific content could become a tsunami. 
If this is really about context, the winner of the next round of browser wars could be the Physical Web 
browser that blends the perfect recipe of preferences, past behavior/click-throughs, segmentation, artificial 
intelligence, and recommendation engines to present the Physical Web that is most relevant in the most 
compelling way. 
 Privacy and Security 
 UriBeacons are arguably even less of a threat to our privacy than iBeacons. Like iBeacons, they are just 
broadcasting to you, not monitoring you. iBeacons require an app to act on the trigger that an iBeacon can 
invoke. The danger of lots of different apps is that there is more chance for a rogue app to do something that 
it shouldn’t do, by abusing the knowledge of where you are and who you are. If a small number of browser 
apps are the readers of all these URLs being broadcast at us, there is more of an opportunity to verify that the 
browser can be trusted, with a single set of permissions and policies on what we want to share with the web 
pages to which the URL is pointing. 
 If we look at security from the point of view of the beacon owner, then they have a number of options to 
control who gets to access the information and resources the URL is pointing to. The owner can constantly 
change the URL using a sequence that only trusted users can understand. They can require login to the 
pages being pointed to. The network that is hosting the resource could be locked down to specific devices or 
IP addresses. There are a lot of options. 
 The Bottom Line 
 The Physical Web is exciting. The barriers to entry are low for beacon makers, for software developers, 
and for individuals. The Physical Web opens up the world of proximity to anyone who can produce a web 
page, which is most organizations. The technology makes all those informational proximity use-cases a lot 
cheaper to implement, and has the scope and architecture to enable a single app to interface with all of the 
gadgets that are being wired into the Internet of Things. Let’s hope Apple agrees. 
 One Beacon, Multiple Standards 
 They say that the great thing about standards is there are so many to choose from. We have seen that 
Eddystone encompasses not one but four frame types (UID, EID, TLM, and URL). iBeacon brings us a 
fifth, AltBeacon a sixth, and many beacon vendors add their own proprietary beacon packets for secure 
identification and management purposes. 
 When choosing a Bluetooth beacon, it’s important to understand which of these frame types is 
supported. Just because a beacon supports Eddystone-UID, doesn’t mean that it supports Eddystone URL. 
 There are a variety of reasons why a beacon vendor may not support certain frame types, from limited 
engineering bandwidth, through to more strategic reasons. Google’s steps toward building a cloud-based 
registry of beacons may look predatory to beacon vendors who are trying to build their own advertising-
based beacon networks. As the standards become more comprehensive, the ability to buy beacon hardware 
from one vendor and work with another vendor’s software and services stack becomes more of a reality. This 
can challenge some of the business models of vendors selling beacons at low margins, or even at a loss. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ STANDARDS
70
 When Google launched Eddystone, a number of beacon vendors (Estimote and Kontakt.io) allowed their 
beacons to be switched from iBeacon to Eddystone, but not to interleave them (although both vendors have 
since announced products that do support this). Why not support all frame types and broadcast them together? 
There are certainly advantages beyond the flexibility and openness. When iOS sees an iBeacon frame, the 
scheduler responds, and callbacks from APIs that are looking for non-iBeacon packets become more responsive. 
Shopkick does this. They boast tens of thousands of beacons deployed in retailers’ stores, broadcasting an 
 iBeacon packet with the same UUID and major and minor device numbers from every beacon, thus rendering 
the UUID information useless. In doing this they get to claim iBeacon compatibility and ensure their app is 
responsive to the proprietary packet they broadcast following the dummy iBeacon packet. 
 The main reason given for not broadcasting multiple frame types is that, with every frame broadcast, 
there is a draw on the battery. Many retail focused beacon vendors mitigate this by providing larger 
batteries—Gimbal, Shopkick, and Swirl being examples of this. With that there is a tradeoff on size and cost. 
It’s clear there isn’t a single right answer. 
 Summary 
 Congratulations, that was a lot! If you have made it this far, you should have a good sense of some of 
the capabilities that the Bluetooth standard opens up to us via the mobile operating system. Both the 
capabilities and constraints should stimulate your ideas for what can be achieved with beacons as well as 
give you a sense of some of the limitations. 
 Next we will look at the chipsets that sit inside the beacon hardware and then at the beacons 
themselves. These implement the standards we just reviewed and form the most tangible part of the 
beacosystem.

 CHAPTER 6  
 Chipsets:  Understanding the Main 
Building Block in a Beacon 
 Who Cares About the Chip in a Beacon? 
 If you are a proximity solutions provider considering whether or not to create your own beacons, 
understanding the different chipsets you can use is essential. That being said, those wanting only to write an 
app that uses beacon APIs don’t really need to understand anything about the chipset inside the Bluetooth 
beacon. Therefore, this chapter is targeted at people who are selecting which type of beacon to deploy, or 
who want to convey to their colleagues the sense that they understand the beacosystem. For them, it will be 
a good idea to learn about the chipsets that are the engines driving this ecosystem. 
 The choice of chipset in a beacon plays a role in determining important characteristics, such as power 
consumption and signal strength. Understanding whether the beacon vendor has used a generic module or 
if they have invested in adding value with enhanced features, such as a more robust antenna, can be critical. 
It is also often worth noting where the beacon vendor has chosen to invest their limited capital, to help you 
consider their viability as a long-term supplier. 
A Dialog Bluetooth Smart SoC and a Nordic Bluetooth Smart Module

CHAPTER 6 ■ CHIPSETS: UNDERSTANDING THE MAIN BUILDING BLOCK IN A BEACON
72
 Chips, Chipsets, SoCs, and Modules 
 Competitively priced, highly functional chipsets have enabled small startups to develop their own beacons 
at relatively low cost. These Bluetooth Smart System on Chips (SoCs) can cost around $2.50, if you buy 
them in volumes of 1,000 or more. If you’ve noticed how many companies have created their own brand of 
beacons, it’s because the chipset vendors made it cheap and surprisingly easy to do so. 
 In the past, a beacon manufacturer had to assemble and integrate a range of chips that each performed 
discrete functions: a CPU,  random access memory (RAM),  read only memory (ROM) , flash memory, a signal 
processor, interface controllers, and a radio transceiver. This is a costly, time-consuming process with an 
element of risk for each additional integration step. Now these components are integrated into a single SoC, 
which forms the main building block for most beacons. 
 The SoC is integrated onto a small  printed circuit board (PCB) the size of a coin, with an antenna, 
additional sensors, and any buttons or LED lights required to create a Bluetooth beacon module. Some 
beacon manufacturers create their own modules when their volumes or their unique requirements justify 
the expense. As the beacon volumes scale from 10,000 to 20,000 units, it may become economical to produce 
your own module. Beacon manufacturers that create their own modules will incur overheads ranging from 
additional design complexity and risk, testing overhead, calibrating/adjusting the output of the signal 
baseband chip, certifications, and managing a more complex supply chain. Hence, only those that will be 
producing enough bulk should consider creating their own module, especially considering how inexpensive 
generic ones are. 
 Chip manufacturers, such as Nordic Semiconductor, provide either the SoC or a version of the SoC 
packaged in a module. Their nRF51822 module/kit retails for about $30 for quantities of one. Chinese 
manufacturers offer their own modules based on the same SoC for around $5. In other cases, such as with 
Broadcom, the SoC manufacturer will partner with a third-party company that will design, manufacture, and 
sell an approved module based on the SoC. 
 A basic beacon is likely to use a small (2 cm) antenna that is printed on the PCB of the module. Some 
beacons, such as the Gimbal S20, have two larger external antennae. One is directional and the other is 
omnidirectional. The quality of the antenna can enhance the range of the beacon as well as control the 
shape of the signal that is transmitted. 
 Once a module has been sourced, adding a battery and a case is required to produce a basic beacon. 
 Many of the beacon chipset vendors provide an example software stack that includes drivers that will 
enable the beacon to transmit iBeacon or Eddystone conformant radio packets or frames. The beacon OEM 
still needs to join  Apple’s MFi (Made for iPhone) program in order to be able to claim the beacon is iBeacon 
compliant. 
 Some History and Gossip 
 We won’t enumerate the model number of every chip produced for the Bluetooth beacon market. (You’re 
welcome.) These product names are typically made up of a concatenation of the initials of the manufacturer 
followed by digits that give a clue to the logical relationship of the product relative to its ancestors in that 
product family. Listing them all would render this book obsolete the week it was published and make its 
pages resemble a phone book. It is, however, useful to understand the lineage of a few of the dominant 
players and why they have been successful. 
 Nordic Semiconductor was the first of the Bluetooth chip manufacturers to focus on the beacon market. 
Their Bluetooth Smart nRF51822 offering was particularly attractive to the burgeoning market of small 
beacon OEMs. Nordic’s approach was different than the larger chip vendors such as Broadcom, which 
focused on supporting a small number of customers who could commit to purchasing very large numbers of 
chips, like major PC or phone vendors. These bigger vendors provided their VIP clients with personal service 
and support via a limited number of systems engineers. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ CHIPSETS: UNDERSTANDING THE MAIN BUILDING BLOCK IN A BEACON
73
 Nordic , on the other hand, provided their support via an online portal that could service the needs of 
an unlimited number of smaller developers. They also provided modules that could be easily leveraged 
with a minimum of additional work, as well as example apps and the software drivers required to support 
the iBeacon standard. Their low-cost developer kits included a module along with connectors and a power 
supply—a complete beacon—but it lacked a case and the cloud services to manage it. Nordic was enabling 
“the long tail”. As a result, their nRF51822 product gained the largest market share in the early stages of the 
beacosystem. Among their customers were companies such as Estimote and Kontoct.io, small companies 
that rapidly grew to be among the leaders in this emerging market. 
 More recently, the other chip vendors, including Broadcom, have moved to adopt the same support 
strategy with its Wireless Internet Connectivity for Embedded Devices for Bluetooth SMART ( WICED 
SMART  ) . It’s argued that they still have a legacy of restricted access to WICED and a way to go before 
addressing large numbers of smaller developers. 
 In this initial phase of the development of the market, Texas Instruments (TI) achieved second place 
in market share. Its product was used in Gimbal beacons such as the S10, which was produced in very large 
numbers and was one of the lowest priced products ($5) on the market. Gimbal’s S20, a higher-end product, 
was used by Apple in its retail stores. This win by TI was not publicized but became generally known in the 
industry.  Qualcomm , which owned  Gimbal at the time, competed with TI and produced its own Bluetooth 
chips via its QCA (Atheros) subsidiary. These chips, however, were Bluetooth Classic and Dual mode chips, 
unsuited for use in beacons, and didn’t require the Bluetooth Classic protocol stack. It would have been 
embarrassing for Qualcomm to have one of its subsidiaries selling beacons with a competitor’s Bluetooth 
chip inside. 
 This is a great example of why beacon vendors are reluctant to disclose whose chip they may be using 
in their beacons. The chipset vendors themselves are typically bound by non-disclosure agreements and so 
are unable to confirm the details of who their customers are. This can be a convenient but legitimate excuse 
when they have very few wins in the market. The truth can typically be unearthed by speaking to competing 
chip vendors, who may not be keen to disclose where they lost a deal, but are not typically barred by an NDA 
from talking about business they didn’t win. 
 Another source of information about which beacon vendor is using a particular chip are the “tear 
down” analyses published on blogs such as    www.aislelabs.com/reports/beacon-guide/  , where new 
beacon models are dismantled and the chipset is listed. 
 Third place went to  Cambridge Scientific Research (CSR)  . 
 In a push to grow revenue and strengthen its position in the Internet of Things market, Qualcomm 
acquired CSR in 2015. Prior to the acquisition,  CSR had been exploring a strategy of marketing their own 
beacons to pull through a cloud service offering and so had not been as aggressive in selling to the beacon 
vendors. With the acquisition by Qualcomm, that strategy has been dropped and they are competing for 
business as a provider of SoCs for beacon vendors. 
 Other vendors are now aiming to displace Nordic by focusing on value-added features such as lower 
power consumption (Dialog) and mesh networking (CSR), which provides an alternative approach to 
management of beacons. 
 Silicon Labs  offerings to beacon manufacturers came from its acquisition of Bluegiga, a smaller 
Scandinavian company that brought its Blue Gecko BGM111 Bluetooth® Smart Module to CSR’s portfolio. 
Bluegiga used TI silicon but with its own custom stack (which in several cases was reported to be more 
reliable than TI’s). Power consumption of this product was higher than Nordic’s product, but newer 
generations became competitive. 
 Dialog was the first Bluetooth Smart vendor to reduce their  transistor size to 55 nanometers 
(55/1,000,000,000 meter). This has enabled them to reduce their power consumption, which in turn extends 
the battery life and makes power harvesting viable. When a beacon’s appetite is modest, its power can be 
harvested from interior lighting and sunlight using photovoltaic cells, from heat, kinetic movement, and 
even from the magnetic radio signals of other sources.

 Table  6-1 lists some of the more notable Bluetooth Beacon chip  vendors  .   
 Attributes of Bluetooth Smart Chipsets 
 This section discusses a few attributes to consider as you evaluate the choice of chipset for a beacon. 
 Flash Memory 
 Flash memory is used to store the firmware code used by the beacon to operate. Unlike ROM (Read Only 
Memory), it enables over-the-air updates of beacon software. It represents an additional cost and consumes 
more power compared to ROM with code written at the factory, but, given the volatile state of standards and 
changes to best practice in management software, it’s a valuable capability.  
 Software Stack 
 Chipset vendors typically provide a baseline implementation of the software that constructs the frames 
or packets in a way that enables the beacon to broadcast data that conforms with the iBeacon and 
Eddystone format. 
 Scripting 
 Some vendors offer higher-level scripting interfaces to make it easier for developers to program the 
functions of the chip.  
 Antenna 
 There are several  antenna types, ceramic chip and Printed Circuit Board (PCB) trace antennae being the 
most common. Not all antennae are equal; they vary in efficiency and directional characteristics. A PCB 
antenna has the advantage of relatively low cost and compact size. It has the risk of interference from the

other components on the PCB, lower performance if the size is too constrained, and a susceptibility to 
interference from environmental effects (people). Unless manufacturing is accurate and reliable, this type of 
antenna can be detuned by relatively small variations in production. A chip antenna requires more expertise 
to implement and increases the cost of the bill of materials, but tends to deliver more robust performance 
and is more easily tuned. 
 Signal Power 
 An additional low noise amplifier can increase signal strength and reduce the noise in a signal. The current 
10dBm signal maximum that is set by the Bluetooth standard may be raised in the future, which will make 
this capability more important. Figure  6-1 shows that there is a significant variation in the maximum signal 
strength of chips from the leading providers. 
 Power Consumption 
 Power consumption needs to be evaluated when the radio is in sleep state and is at the peak when it is 
transmitting.  Power consumption is directly influenced by the size of the circuits etched into the silicon 
chip. By reducing this size, power consumption can be reduced. While a lot more power is consumed when 
transmitting, the power consumed in sleep state is also important, as beacons spend most of their time 
sleeping. 
 In Figure  6-2 , Dialog’s DA14580 is shown to have the most frugal power consumption. However, the 
Cypress part needs only 60nA of power in full sleep mode, which is lower than almost all other devices. The 
amount of time spent transmitting versus sleeping becomes important in evaluating these characteristics.

CHAPTER 6 ■ CHIPSETS: UNDERSTANDING THE MAIN BUILDING BLOCK IN A BEACON
76
 Development Support 
 This is an important area to evaluate. How much access to support engineers can you expect and how 
good are the online resources, documentation, code samples, knowledge base, online Q&A, and developer 
communities?  
 Cost of Development Tools 
 Before committing to a vendor, it’s important to understand any licensing costs for the software and any 
necessary development tools. Proprietary CPUs (sometimes referred to as an MCU—Micro Controller 
Unit—in these applications) can have proprietary development tools. These may require you to spend even 
more on licenses. The radios on a Bluetooth chip are often defined in software, which makes for a very 
flexible environment, but can put constraints on the development tools used to link this software with the 
applications that a beacon vendor may choose to create for the beacon. This may imply a cost that a startup 
may not want to incur. 
 
ARM HOLDINGS
 “Mighty oaks from little acorns grow.” 
 ARM is an unusual designer of processors; they don’t manufacture anything. Instead, they license 
their designs to chip OEMs. This business model has been very successful. As of 2015, over 60 billion 
ARM processors have been shipped, 95% of smartphones use ARM processors and their licensees 
include Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, and TI. Their processors also power fridges, thermostats, and most 
Bluetooth beacons.

CHAPTER 6 ■ CHIPSETS: UNDERSTANDING THE MAIN BUILDING BLOCK IN A BEACON
77
 Originally known as Acorn RISC Machines, ARM got its start in the early 1980s making processors for 
the British Broadcasting Corporation’s BBC Micro Computer. 
 The  Acorn Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architecture was a revolutionary change from the 
 Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC) designs that were widespread before this. 
 The engineer who led this revolution was Sophie Wilson (born Roger Wilson), a heavily awarded 
Cambridge university graduate and Fellow of the Royal Society. 
 Mesh 
 With a  mesh architecture , beacons could occasionally (daily) connect to their neighbors to transfer status 
information, such as battery life, and propagate configuration changes and firmware updates. The Bluetooth 
SIG is working on a standard in this area, but as of 2015, the offerings in the market are all proprietary.  
 Security 
 In addition to the standard Bluetooth encryption, some vendors offer additional levels of encryption and key 
exchange. One architectural feature, which is standard for an application processor, is the implementation 
of separate hardware-enforced segmentation between the data and code segments used by the chip vendor 
and those used by the beacon OEM. This can make spotting bugs easier as well as preventing rogue code 
from overwriting code in the beacon for malicious purposes.  
 Processor 
 The  processor performance requirements for beacons to operate are modest. These devices aren’t streaming 
media or doing complex analysis, so speed isn’t a major priority. In fact, having an overpowered CPU is likely 
to consume more of the beacon’s battery power, something that is in limited supply. Many of the chipset 
vendors license the generic ARM Cortex M0 design, which is the smallest and most energy-efficient of the 
processors that ARM offers for embedded applications.  
 Sensors 
 In addition to sensing temperature, which is very common, chipsets integrate other sensors for barometric 
pressure, acceleration, direction, magnetism, and light. This can be useful if the beacon is being used in 
shipping, industrial, or medical applications to measure the integrity of packages, other devices, or products. 
 Certification 
 One of the questions that needs to be answered is how to make sure your beacons are certified with the 
Bluetooth SIG and with the appropriate regulators in all the countries where you want to deploy beacons. 
Bluetooth chipset vendors can help with this, but they don’t necessarily cover all regions that you may have 
designs on. And if you are manufacturing the beacons, there are still additional certification costs that have 
to be considered. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ CHIPSETS: UNDERSTANDING THE MAIN BUILDING BLOCK IN A BEACON
78
 Bluetooth Certification 
 Most mainstream Bluetooth chipset vendors will provide software and radio frequency (RF) circuitry in 
their reference design that is qualified as compliant with the necessary parts of the Bluetooth standard 
they support. This requires them to go through a testing process with authorized testers and an approved 
test house, providing evidence of their conformance. This is an expensive process. But you can avoid that 
expense; so long as your design is “similar enough” to the original, your company won’t have to go through a 
recertification process. 
 Using a qualified design, all a beacon OEM needs to do is join the Bluetooth SIG and pay the requisite 
fee (as of 2015 this is between $2,500 and $8,000, depending on your size and SIG membership status), do 
some paperwork, sign a  Declaration of Compliance (DoC) , and voila! Your beacon is Bluetooth qualified. 
You can then use the Bluetooth name and logo to describe it. Purchasers of beacons should be looking for 
these trademarks to be confident that the beacon will be interoperable. 
 In order to be able to sell products in major markets such as the United States, Europe, Canada, Japan, 
and Korea, companies must comply with different regional certification processes. These tests verify that the 
device is not causing harmful radiated emissions or interference on regulated frequencies. The IDs, marks, 
and logos associated with those certifications (see Figure  6-3 ) generally have to be permanently displayed 
on the products in a way that is visible to purchasers (see Figure  6-4 ). When deploying beacons in small pilot 
projects, verifying that beacons have been through this process may not be high on the priority list, but as 
deployments scale, this should be something that is confirmed. It’s surprising to see how many Bluetooth 
beacons sold in the United States don’t have the mandatory FCC ID 4-17 character identifier.    
 Figure 6-3.    The CE Mark and FCC logo indicates compliance with mandatory standards for products to ship 
in Europe and the United States, respectively 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ CHIPSETS: UNDERSTANDING THE MAIN BUILDING BLOCK IN A BEACON
79
 Regional  Certification 
 The beacon OEM, under certain conditions, may use the FCC ID of the module vendor. In particular, 
the antenna needs to be of the same or similar type and equal or less gain to that used in the module 
manufacturer’s testing. 
 Given that testing for a region can cost $25,000, it’s important to understand the regions where your 
supplier has already gained certification . 
 Operational Temperature Range 
 Certain modules and chipsets may be designed to work in extended temperature ranges, up to 105 degrees 
Celsius. It’s advisable to validate your temperature requirements. A beacon may be subjected to harsh 
environmental conditions if placed outside on signage, in a storage environment, gas pump, vending 
machine, or an industrial location.

CHAPTER 6 ■ CHIPSETS: UNDERSTANDING THE MAIN BUILDING BLOCK IN A BEACON
80
 Summary 
 The platform provided to the makers of beacons by manufacturers of Bluetooth semiconductors is 
impressive. As solution designers, we are standing on the shoulders of giants. These giants have spent years 
developing very functional building blocks for us to use at a remarkably low cost. But there are still tradeoffs 
and decisions to be made and they will drive the choices of silicon vendor and product. While the details 
may be technical, the decisions will be driven by business strategy and priorities—the geographies where 
the beacon will be sold, the features where differentiation will be required, and the performance that is 
expected. 
 Having studied what’s inside the beacon, the next logical step is to look at the beacons themselves.

 Choosing the Right Beacon 
 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CHOOSING THE RIGHT BEACON
82
 What do cable TV and the line-up of Bluetooth beacon vendors have in common? The answer is “choice,” or 
to be more precise, the paradox of choice. As of writing this chapter, there are over 300 beacon vendors listed 
in our sister 1 online database of Proximity Solution Providers (PSPs),  Proxbook (see Figure  7-1 ). There are so 
many choices that it can feel like “there’s nothing on”. 
 Figure 7-1.  The   www.proxbook.com directory of PSPs 
 1 Proxbook is a crowdsourced listing of PSPs that grew out of a realization that any list of beacon providers we captured 
in these pages would be out of date before the publisher’s CMS could send its pages to the print-on-demand service. Our 
clunky WordPress database was then adopted by the folks at Unacast, taking the crowdsourced database from 80 PSPs to 
over 300. So strictly speaking we are the birth parents of    www.proxbook.com   (which has since been adopted by wealthier 
parents), not the sibling.  
 So Many Vendors, So Little Time 
 Why so many beacon vendors? As we saw in the prior chapters, the barrier to entry for aspiring beacon 
vendors is low. The silicon vendors make creating a beacon relatively easy and the huge flow of venture 
capital has enabled many to take that route. 
 Predictions are a dangerous game, but one that’s a fairly safe bet is that most of the 300 beacon 
providers won’t be able to survive as  beacon hardware vendors   for the long run. This means that for us as 
solution designers, there are plenty of opportunities to pick a dud.  
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CHOOSING THE RIGHT BEACON
83
 A Platform Decision 
 Your choice of beacon has significant ramifications. Once you are into the production phase of your project, 
you face major switching costs because while beacons are built around a set of standards, there are major 
gaps where solutions are still proprietary. We will highlight these areas as we review the criteria you should 
consider to make your choice. 
 When choosing a beacon vendor you are making a platform decision. The beacon is a foundation 
of firmware, hardware, cloud software, and hopefully a range of third-party solutions built on top of the 
platform. Building on a platform saves time, reduces risk (if you choose wisely), and opens up an ecosystem 
of third-party products that can be easily integrated. 
 Choose the wrong platform and you could be impacting the viability of the app that’s being developed, 
saddling yourself with costs and constraints that could kill your project. 
 So is there a single vendor that’s clearly the best? We don’t think so. We will provide a brief profile of a 
handful that we think deserve to be on any short list, but first we should run through the criteria to use when 
selecting a beacon vendor. 
 Some of these criteria will sound generic, or applicable to any product choice. Things like price, but in 
every case there is something specific to the  beacosystem   that should be considered. 
 There is one criterion that deserves its own special place in the sun, but will be the last to be discussed 
in detail, and that’s volume. A quick preview: unless the number of development kits your chosen vendor 
has sold is in five figures, you need to look seriously at their ability to survive in the long term and at what the 
impact of their demise might be on your solution. 
 The Criteria 
 To make navigating the criteria manageable, we have grouped them into three clusters:
• 
 Physical aspects of the hardware 
• 
 Firmware, software, and services 
• 
 Business aspects of your solution 
 Physical Aspects of the Hardware 
 When you start to apply this criteria, the number of viable vendors for any given requirement starts to get 
manageable pretty quickly. 
 The Case: Looks 
 Are looks important? They are if you are an American newscaster 2 or a Bluetooth beacon. It’s amazing 
how many different designs have been created to package a  Bluetooth beacon . One of the first questions 
to answer is, do you want your beacons to be noticed or to blend into the background? As you can see in 
Figure  7-2 , Estimote’s delicious industrial design creates an object that looks beautiful and attracts attention. 
Their design is arguably a major factor behind the success of the company. 
 2 I personally prefer newscasters who have bad teeth and rumpled clothing; it shows they are focused on journalism 
rather than hairspray and were clearly promoted on that basis.  

CHAPTER 7 ■ CHOOSING THE RIGHT BEACON
84
 As beacons came to the notice of the press corps, no article on the subject was complete without a 
photograph of these colorful space-age devices. Estimote’s web site has benefited from the highest web 
traffic of any of the major vendors, partially as a result of the eye candy they sell. For solution providers who 
want to make an impression, this can be a major plus. 
 However, the reverse is also true. Many larger retailers have a strong desire to control the look and feel 
of their stores. Distracting shoppers with colorful beacons can be problematic.  Gimbal’s S20 beacons were 
produced in a tasteful but discrete rectangular case, with a white finish and no brand name visible. The 
thinking being that this will not compete with the displays on which the retailer’s professional merchandiser 
is trying to focus the customer’s attention. 
 The Gimbal beacons that have been deployed by Apple in the Apple retail stores are the same metallic 
finish as much of the rest of the store. You have to look carefully to see them. Shopkick’s shopBeacon 
achieves an appealing design aesthetic (Figure  7-3 ), with a white gloss finish and a curvaceous shape (to 
accommodate its D batteries) that can simultaneously blend in and look good. 
 Figure 7-2.  Estimote beacons are conspicuous by design 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CHOOSING THE RIGHT BEACON
85
 Having a beacon that is visually appealing and distinctive can make it irresistible to children who want 
to take “toys” home, especially if the toys have flashing lights. 
 Chinese vendor Sensoro takes a similar approach with its most compact beacon, the Yunzi, shown 
in Figure  7-4 . With its brushed steel edges, it would fit in well next to any display of high-end watches or 
phones. This is good because Sensoro beacons have been deployed in jewelry stores across China 3 . 
 Figure 7-3.  Shopkick beacons blend into the background despite their size 
 3 The beacons enabled a campaign at 237 of Chow Tai Fook’s 2,300+ jewelry stores in China. This drove the presentation 
of over 24,000 coupons and $16 million of sales revenue during the Chinese New Year. Check out the case study, full of 
specific metrics, at  post.sensoro.com/case-study-for-monetized-beacon-deployment-in-china/ . 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CHOOSING THE RIGHT BEACON
86
 This has been observed in beacon deployments at schools. The fact that the beacons were useless to the 
kids didn’t prevent them being “borrowed”. 
 The Case: Protection 
 The next major factor to consider is, does the beacon need to be weatherproof. Many deployments will be 
inside and this won’t be an issue, but there are quite a few applications where environmental conditions 
can be challenging: drive-throughs, parking lots, outdoor signage, statues, street furniture, car washes, and 
industrial facilities are all locations where beacons have been deployed and where they need a well-sealed 
outer shell. 
 If this is the case, there are standards to look for. One such standard is the International Electrotechnical 
Commission’s (IEC) Ingress Protection (IP) Code, International Protection Marketing IEC Standard 60529 4 . 
Under this standard, a product’s protection level is designated by three numbers, although generally only the 
first two are used. The first number designates the level of protection against solid objects, the second deals 
with protection against liquids, and the third deals with impact protection. For example,  IP686 is the highest 
level of protection against all of those factors. Check out Figure  7-5 , which illustrates the qualities of an IP67 
beacon case.

 The United States National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA)   has a standard (250-2003 5 ) 
for electrical enclosure types that provides an alternative benchmark. It goes beyond what might otherwise 
be vague assurances from a vendor. A  NEMA Type 3 enclosure   is designed to “provide a degree of protection 
with respect to harmful effects on the equipment due to the ingress of water (rain, sleet, or snow); and that 
will be undamaged by the external formation of ice on the enclosure”. Type 4 enclosures provide “a degree of 
protection against ingress of water from a hose”. Type 6 protects against “occasional temporary submersion,” 
while 6P protects against occasional prolonged submersion. 
 There is a potential tradeoff in terms of cost and ease of access as the standards increase.  Estimote’s 
Proximity beacon can be completely submerged in water, but the case needs to be cut open with a knife if 
you want to change the batteries (as you can see in Figure  7-6 ).

 Fixing and Physical Security 
 Since most beacons are relatively light in terms of weight, the most popular method of fixing them to walls 
is with some kind of adhesive strip, which usually comes prefixed to the case. Some vendors produce an 
industrial case with screw holes (see Figure  7-7 ) and a very few have bayonet screw sockets, the kind used to 
attach cameras to tripods. 
 Figure 7-6.  Inside an Estimote beacon, cut open to reveal the motherboard and battery 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CHOOSING THE RIGHT BEACON
91
 Maybe because the cost of beacons is relatively low and they have little value to individuals, there 
is generally a lack of physical security such as locks to protect access to the beacon case. This would 
significantly increase the cost of the “bill-of-materials” for a product. 
 Gimbal’s S21 beacon case can be secured using a Torex tamper-resistant six point star screw head 6 . 
 Often beacons are hidden behind products, out of reach or within other more secure casings, in order to 
avoid tampering. 
 When this is done, care needs to be taken that any additional casing doesn’t interfere with the signal 
direction or strength. When metal sheets make up the casing of a vending machine with a beacon inside, this 
can create issues, whereas plastic covers shouldn’t be a problem.      
 Signal Strength 
 As we saw in the previous chapter on the chipsets used in beacons, maximum signal strength and range can 
vary. Achieving a 50-meter range with a strong (0dBm) signal is generally possible, assuming there are no 
physical obstructions that might attenuate the signal. 
 Chip manufacturer Silicon Labs’ Bluegiga has produced a long-range module, the BLE121LR. It 
transmits at +8dBm and claims to be able to achieve up to 450 meters of range. This module is used in 
BlueSense networks’ BlueBar beacon long-range product.

CHAPTER 7 ■ CHOOSING THE RIGHT BEACON
92
 Generally beacons powered from main or USB power supplies are designed with stronger signal output, 
as there is no need to reduce power consumption to conserve battery life. Most beacons allow for the signal 
strength and thus signal range to be modulated, in order to support specific use-cases and to preserve 
battery life. 
 There can be variations in signal strength between beacons from the same manufacturer of the same 
model. For this reason, it’s a good idea to calibrate the signal strength of each individual beacon when 
deploying them for use-cases that require higher accuracy. Calibration involves measuring the received 
signal strength of the beacon at a specified distance (1 meter) and recording that in the setup parameters of 
the beacon. The RSSI number can then be broadcast by the beacon to receiving devices, so the receiver can 
factor this into the decision at to when to trigger actions.  
 Antenna 
 While many beacon vendors use the  antennae built into the modules provided by the chipset vendors, some 
have external antenna, which may more efficiently extend the signal range of the chipset. 
 The antenna also affects the shape of the signal. Most Bluetooth beacons have an omnidirectional 
antenna, meaning that the signal generation radiates fairly evenly from the devices. However, the shape of 
the signal is not perfectly round; it’s actually doughnut  shaped  (Figure  7-8 ). 
 Figure 7-8.    The omnidirectional antennae used on most Bluetooth beacons radiate a signal that is doughnut 
shaped (illustration selected for memorability) 
 This is something to consider when positioning the beacon vertically (sideways) rather than 
horizontally, as the signal may not go as far as you expect if you are pointing the hole of the doughnut at the 
space where you want the signal to go. 
 There is no substitute for testing the signal with the beacon in place. 
 The signal from a directional  antenna is cone shaped. Unfortunately, this cone lacks clear structural 
integrity. Its borders are not clear-cut and there is likely to be signal radiation that comes out of the bottom 
of the cone. Think of an ice cream melting and the contents spilling onto your shorts (Figure  7-9 ). 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CHOOSING THE RIGHT BEACON
93
 This impacts the  applications in which we can use beacons in significant ways. Consider when you 
have beacons in gas pumps and you want to be sure that you can differentiate between the two sides of the 
pump island (pump #1 versus pump #2). The directionality of the beacon on its own may not be enough to 
shape the signal in order to avoid a false positive effect. A false positive is where a driver is thought to be on 
one side of the island when they are actually on the other side. These issues can be managed and will be 
discussed in the chapter on beacon placement. 
 The  Gimbal S20 and S21 beacons have both an omnidirectional and a directional antenna. The selection 
of which one to use is made during the configuration process. Zebra Technologies (previously known as 
Motorola Solutions) offer an MB2000 beacon with directional antenna with a 120-degree beam width.  
 Sensors 
 The iBeacon specification doesn’t incorporate any support for beacon sensors, yet from early on many 
Bluetooth beacons have integrated a battery sensor, a temperature sensor, and an accelerometer into 
their design. The sensors may be configured and read using a custom  Bluetooth Generic ATTribute Profile 
(GATT) command. Beacon vendors provide a proprietary API that uses the profile to connect to their 
beacon. Google defined a more standard approach to reading the output from a basic set of sensors with the 
Eddystone TLM frame. This transmits just the temperature and battery level. 
 Sensors on beacons have proved valuable for use-cases such as measuring the weather for marketing 
campaigns for soft drinks, sales of which are influenced by how hot the weather is. Beacon sensors have 
been used to monitor the status of refrigeration units and the integrity of valuable packages shipped by 
logistics companies.

 TI’s SensorTag (shown in Figure  7-10 ) is probably one of the most “sensitive” beacons on the market. It’s 
attracted a lot of interest and stimulated creative projects from the “maker” 7 community, due to its plethora 
of on-chip sensors (monitoring local temperature and battery) plus seven sensor peripheral chips integrated 
onto its motherboard: 
• 
  Infra Red temperature (measuring the temperature of objects at a distance when the 
beacon is pointed at them) 
• 
  Accelerometer for XYZ axis measurements 
• 
 Humidity 
• 
 Barometric pressure 
• 
 Magnetometer 
• 
 Gyroscope 
• 
 Light

 All this plus an LED and a buzzer make it an impressive package. It’s priced competitively at $29 for 
a single beacon. It appears that TI’s goal with SensorTag is to illustrate the capabilities of the underlying 
chipset, rather than competing aggressively with its own customers, the beacon manufacturers. 
 Cell Batteries and Power Beacons 
 The slim and economic CR2032 coin cell battery is the power source that captured the imagination of the 
Bluetooth low-energy ecosystem. In other cases, taking the beacon to the power and taking the power to the 
beacon is often not practical. But sometimes it works out. Let’s review both these options now. 
 Long Live the CR2032 
 How could such a tiny battery sustain a beacon for months of operation? The low-energy consumption of 
Bluetooth Smart is remarkable, and it would be even more remarkable if a CR2032  battery could sustain 
beacons for more than a month when configured to meet most use-cases. Sadly, that’s not the case. 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CHOOSING THE RIGHT BEACON
95
 If a beacon is configured to broadcast at full power at the frequency required to conform to Apple’s 
iBeacon specification (10 times a second), you will be lucky to get a month of life out of that tiny CR2032. 
 That’s not to say that you can’t throttle back the beacon’s battery consumption to eke out a longer 
life. Vendors such as Estimote and Ubudu have been resourceful in making it easy to dial down the signal 
strength and frequency to extend battery life and to layer on other energy saving schemes, such as shutting 
down transmissions at times when the beacons are not likely to be needed—at night for instance. 
 Conversely demands on power are rising as beacons are asked to work harder by broadcasting multiple 
packet types to maintain compatibility with different standards. As beacons are accessed by multiple 
applications, supporting the lowest denominator in terms of signal strength and frequency is no longer 
possible. Adding management features where beacons are talking to each other in a mesh and broadcasting 
telematics and the CR2032 seems very limiting. 
 The labor cost of organizing battery changes far outweighs the savings on the battery. Vendors such as 
Swirl, Gimbal, Zebra, and Shopkick, with a focus on larger retail deployments, have produced devices that 
run off much larger batteries, to extend battery life to more than a year.  
 As discussed in the standards chapter, it’s necessary to broadcast beacon packets frequently (10x 
a second) if the goal is to ensure an app in the background detects the beacon. However, if a beacon is 
broadcasting Eddystone URL packets that are meant to interact with a browser running in the foreground, 
we can safely reduce our broadcast frequency to once a second and our battery life extends proportionately. 
 Battery life is complex to predict. In addition to the chemistry of the battery itself, it’s influenced by the 
current that is drawn, the temperature of the environment, temperature fluctuations (are your beacons going 
to be sitting outside in New York or San Diego), and how long the battery has been in storage 9 . The higher 
the current drawn, the more energy is lost in heat for example. We haven’t been operating beacons for 20 
years, so there has been a lack of history from which to extrapolate. All this, combined with the changes 
in the software that is running on beacons, helps explain why vendor predictions have not always been as 
accurate as we would all want. 
 A very rough rule of thumb is that a beacon will consume over 250 milliamps a month if broadcasting 
10 times a second at full power 10 . Using that rule of thumb, we can look at the battery capacity in Figure  7-11 
and get a sense for what kind of battery packs we should be looking for in our beacon. Your mileage will vary 
considerably, but if in doubt (and let’s face it, we are in doubt), go for a bigger battery.

alkaline_appman.pdf  
 10 We have already discussed the multitude of variables, including the chipset technology, but in this case let’s throw 
caution to the wind in the interest of figuring out the battery requirements at a gross level.  

CHAPTER 7 ■ CHOOSING THE RIGHT BEACON
96
 Powered Beacons  
 After wallowing in the challenges of using batteries in beacons, solution designers may start to contemplate 
eliminating the use of battery powered beacons altogether. Being able to plug beacons into a handy power 
socket is frequently not possible. If that’s the case, we start to consider the feasibility in our plans of bringing 
the power to the places where beacons are required. Since beacons are still at an experimental phase, 
compelling proven ROIs are in short supply. In cases where beacons need to be placed in very specific 
locations in a store, laying in power cables to a new location is expensive in terms of people, capital, permits, 
and the union labor that is often required to deal with electrical systems. Beyond the cost, it also adds a level 
of complexity and disruption that makes projects a lot less likely to happen. 
 In cases where a single beacon is simply being used for a basic check-in use-case, placement may not 
be an issue. If the beacon needs to be near a point of sale terminal, a vending machine, a ticket kiosk, a 
gas pump, or a digital display, it’s likely there will be power available, either from a power socket or a USB 
connector. Power can also be obtained from network cables, with additional power over Ethernet splitter 
hardware that provides power to a beacon via a USB connection.

CHAPTER 7 ■ CHOOSING THE RIGHT BEACON

 Therefore, selecting a beacon vendor that can provide the option to deploy a USB version of your 
beacon of choice is highly desirable. 
 All of the major industrial lighting companies that sell LED lighting for retail, office and industrial 
applications are introducing beacon offerings. GE Lighting and Acuity has been public about this. One of 
the things that they bring to the market is the fact that their product is already wired into power. 
 Firmware, Software, and Services 
 With so much of the hardware value being provided by the chip vendors, the software and services required 
for an effective beacon are the most significant technology components that differentiate beacon vendors 
from each other. 
 Beacon vendors can be divided into two broad categories:
• 
 General-purpose beacons (e.g. Estimote, Gimbal, Kontakt.io, and Radius Networks) 
• 
 Vertically-integrated solutions (e.g. Facebook, GasBuddy, Shopkick, and Tile) 
 The  general-purpose beacon vendors offer a product that can be used for a very diverse set of applications. 
They have to provide a very broad set of features and functions to support thousands of use-cases. 
 The  vertically-integrated solution vendors currently don’t offer their product for developers to buy 
as a building block for their own solution, and because of that they can be a lot more focused in terms of 
the protocols they support and the tools they offer. The GasBuddy beacon isn’t for sale on the GasBuddy 
web site; it comes as part of a package of advertising services for convenience stores that only come from 
GasBuddy. Tile doesn’t have to worry about supporting the Eddystone URL standard because it’s not 
necessary for the solution they provide, i.e., finding lost keys, wallets, and other items from their app. 
 Firmware and Configuration Updates 
 One thing we can be sure of is that the firmware on beacons will continue to change. Protocols will evolve, 
energy-saving schemes will improve, management techniques will evolve, and requirements in terms of 
signal strength and broadcast frequency may change as new use-cases are introduced. 
 There are a variety of approaches to performing these updates. Assuming the beacons you have selected 
have flash memory (not all do), they all involve sending the updates over the air (OTA). The differences are 
in the distribution source and the way the transfer is initiated. There are five main approaches:
• 
 Admin App to Device— Hard Reset . This first approach requires an administrator 
to perform a physical reset of the device either by pressing a button inside or outside 
the beacon case or removing the batteries and re-inserting them. As the beacon 
reboots, the admin app can then be used to transfer the changes OTA. Blesh beacons 
have an internal switch to do this. The Physical Web reference beacons provide an 
external reset button. 
 If the beacons are situated out of reach, then ladders are obviously required. 
Obtaining a ladder can be more difficult than it might seem, especially when 
heavy security or union rules are involved. So there is a penalty in terms of time. 
The argument in favor of these more physical methods is that they provide a 
level of physical security that mitigates the risk that beacons could be hijacked by 
armchair based hackers. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CHOOSING THE RIGHT BEACON
98
• 
 Admin App to Device— Software Reset . The second approach is for the beacon 
vendors’ administration app to be able to connect to a beacon and initiate a 
firmware update without any physical interaction with the beacon. 
 BluVision, Estimote, Kontakt.io, Zebra MPact, and many other beacons support 
this approach. 
• 
 Wi-Fi Hub Updates . A less common approach is for the beacon vendor to use a 
Bluetooth to Wi-Fi gateway device. This connects to the beacons within range and 
then provides a cloud connection via Wi-Fi over which monitoring, configuration 
changes, and firmware updates can be performed. BluVision supports this approach 
using its BluFi Bluetooth-to-Wi-Fi sensor. Kontakt.io supports this using its Cloud 
Beacon. A main power socket powers the BluVision device. The Kontakt.io device is 
rechargeable, with 12,800mAh of capacity, or it can simply run off a USB connection. 
Neither device is a Wi-Fi access point; they simply provide a bridge to link to the 
outside world provided by a separate Wi-Fi access point. 
 Vendors that offer Wi-Fi infrastructure (Aerohive, Aruba/HP, Cisco, Ruckus, 
and Zebra) are slowly integrating their management platforms so that they can 
monitor the presence of iBeacons. In the future it would make sense for them to 
be able to update the firmware and settings of beacons using that infrastructure. 
Given the lack of standards that apply to these update functions, this will 
require some strategic decisions to be made as to what beacon platforms will 
be supported. For Zebra, they already have a robust beacon offering MPact. As 
of Q4 2015, updates to beacons require an iOS device to be used, but that could 
change. Aerohive have partnered with Radius networks to promote plugging 
their powered RadBeacons into the USB port on an Aerohive router. Ruckus 
partnered with Gimbal to provide monitoring. Cisco, the master of corporate 
acquisitions, could well test the waters for its next purchase by partnering with 
one or two beacon providers. HP’s Aruba appears to have gone the furthest in 
the integration of its own USB and battery-powered Bluetooth beacons with 
their Wi-Fi access points, enabling configuration updates to be pushed from the 
access points via Bluetooth to beacons that are in range. 
• 
 Consumer App to Device . An approach that can save on the cost of sending staff out 
to update beacons is to crowdsource updates using your customers’ phones that 
are running your app. The Estimote SDK supports embedding this function in the 
customer’s app. It downloads the updates over the cloud and then transfers them to 
beacons within range that require the update. Some customers may feel this is not a 
reasonable approach, so exercise great caution before adopting this strategy. 
• 
 Mesh Updates . Chipset vendors such as CSR and beacon vendors such as Ubudu are 
promoting using mesh networks to link Bluetooth beacons. There is potential in the 
future for monitoring, configuration, and firmware updates to be propagated across 
these networks, eliminating the need to have IT staff tour all the beacons in a venue 
to perform these tasks.

 Management 
 We have devoted a whole chapter to this subject, but for now lets simply register the fact that evaluating the 
tools provided for management by your beacon hardware provider is key. With the exception of vendors 
implementing Google’s Eddystone management interface, most of the management interfaces with beacons 
are proprietary, so management vendors can’t easily address the task of managing third-party beacons, 
unless there is a strategic relationship in place between the suppliers. Solution providers currently look to 
their beacon hardware vendors to provide the tools here. 
 Security/Hijacking 
 The aspect of security we are discussing here is the protection against “hijacking,” which is unauthorized 
configuration and firmware updates. This could be used to take down the proximity service and use it for 
unauthorized means. 
 This is another area where there is a lack of standards to support a cross-platform approach to 
authentication and prevention of such attacks. Unfortunately, there are enough standards in other areas to 
make hacks quite easy. Bluetooth’s Secure Simple Paring enables a handset to connect to the beacon. Passkeys 
used by the beacons may be broadcast in the clear, so that someone in the vicinity of the wireless conversation 
could then monitor this and use the password. Once connected, standard Bluetooth GATT commands can 
make changes to the beacon setup. Ask your vendor what they have done to defend against this. 
 Some don’t allow any configuration changes without physical access, others are implementing 
encrypted communication channels to prevent snooping on passkeys, and others are implementing 
industry standards such as OAuth as a way of controlling access to the  beacon.  
     Power Consumption 
 The  power consumption of a beacon is a function of both hardware and firmware. It’s like the mileage of 
a car, a very significant factor that impacts cost and frequency of refueling which is a disruptive process. 
Despite the fact that there are a limited number of engines or chipsets in use and the chipset is a significant 
factor in the efficiency of the beacon, the chipsets is only the denominator in this equation. It’s the way the 
beacon designer drives that engine that is the deciding factor in the mileage you will get. Do they have “a 
lead foot” pushing hard on the accelerator or are they judicious in the way they use the engine cycles? 
 Unfortunately, there is no federal standard on how this mileage is reported and so as a buyer you need 
to beware. Your mileage will vary. Consider the factors already discussed and you can decide whether 
you think this is going to be an SUV or a hybrid. How many frame types are being broadcast? What is the 
frequency of broadcast? Do we have the ability to throttle back the signal strength? What’s the capacity of 
the batteries? There is no substitute for a test drive under the conditions that you expect to see for your 
application. 
 Operating Temperature 
 One other factor that will impact battery life will be the  environmental temperatures   (see example Figure  7-12 ). 
Low temperatures will tend to constrain the output efficiency of the battery.  

CHAPTER 7 ■ CHOOSING THE RIGHT BEACON
100
 More fundamentally you will need to consider if there are extremes of temperature that will impact your 
beacon of choice and the ability for the beacon to survive at that temperature. 
 If you are deploying in  a  shopping mall or office, this is unlikely to be an issue, but if the beacon is going to 
be outdoors in Minnesota or Moscow, or in a gas pump or vending machine in Arizona, it’s something to factor 
in. Machines like gas pumps will have been designed with extended temperature operating requirements in 
mind and anything that is included in those enclosures will need to operate within the same range. 
 Extended temperature ranges are a function of the core chipset or module, as well as the other 
components and circuit board that surrounds them. So just because the Bluetooth module is certified for hot 
temperatures, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the other components can take it. 
 SDK 
 Although theoretically developers can use the standard iBeacon and Eddystone APIs offered on iOS and 
Android, most major beacon vendors provide their own SDK. Before the introduction of Eddystone, this was 
a necessity in order to support beacons on Android, because there was no native alternative. The beacon 
vendor SDK also enables the access control features that have been missing from the first release of iBeacon 
and Eddystone. 
 Surely you would want to avoid using these proprietary SDKs. In theory, yes, but usually there are 
features you will want to access that are only available by using the beacon vendor’s  SDK . These vary in the 
value add that they offer, but the features can include:
• 
 Access to sensor data 
• 
 Conditional access 
• 
 Fleet management, tracking, monitoring, and configuration  
• 
 Analytics 
• 
 Location/mapping functions—trilateration/wayfinding 
• 
 Additional proximity and location features such as geofencing 
• 
 Orchestration features: content management and campaign management 
 Figure 7-12.    A gauge showing the current temperature in San Diego       
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CHOOSING THE RIGHT BEACON
101
 These features may represent significant value for your solution requirements, or they may be a driver 
for increased pricing that makes the offering less attractive. So decide up-front where you want to source 
these functions before paying your beacon provider extra. For those of us who are averse to sports and have 
had to pay our cable providers every month for ESPN,     why subject yourselves to the same annoyance of 
paying for features you never use with beacons? 
 Protocols 
 We discussed the iBeacon and Eddystone standards in Chapter   5 , but it’s worth emphasizing that using these 
native  protocols  offers significant benefit. There is no substitute for having access to the operating system 
hooks for both iOS and Android that enable control and integration with bundled apps and services that 
can’t be achieved otherwise. Nearly all vendors support iBeacon, but there are vendors that don’t support 
Eddystone, or only support a subset of Eddystone frame types. There are reasons for concern regarding 
Eddystone, specifically having to register the metadata about all your beacons in Google’s cloud, but that 
choice should be yours, not your beacon vendor’s. If the beacon vendor doesn’t support Eddystone, this 
should be cause for concern. 
 The other area to clarify is the ability to have a single beacon interleaving all protocols simultaneously. 
Rather than having to choose one protocol or another, you should have the option to use both. Beacon 
vendors may claim that there are battery issues with doing this, but this raises the question as to whether 
they should be offering larger batteries. It should be you as a solution designer who makes that tradeoff, 
rather than having your hands tied by the beacon vendor. 
 In addition to the protocols discussed in other chapters, there are the beacon providers’ proprietary 
protocols that were born prior to iBeacon (for example, Gimbal’s native protocol and Swirl’s SecureCast, 
which is supported along with iBeacon and Eddystone by Zebra). Zebra has done the best job of convincing 
other vendors to forsake their beacon offerings and use Zebra’s, so that the vendor can focus on their value 
add further up the solutions stack, e.g., ad networking or analytics. 
 Conditional Access 
 Conditional access allows the beacon owner/manager to control what apps see a specific beacon. This can 
provide a guard against having your beacons used for showrooming, or it can be the cornerstone of the 
beacon networks and ad networks that we will explore later. 
 Not every application requires conditional access, but this has gone from an exotic differentiator to a 
commonplace feature. Selecting a beacon platform without this feature should be done with great care. 
 Now with Google releasing its Eddystone Ephemeral ID frame type, conditional access is even more 
broadly available. The question becomes, why would you use one of the current proprietary conditional 
access APIs rather than a standard that doesn’t tie you to a  specific  beacon vendor? 
 Analytics 
 Beacons are often sold as  analytics tools . The reality is they are one ingredient, a cookie, a data source for 
analytics tools. 
 Analytics is a huge technology domain. It’s unlikely that a beacon hardware vendor will be able to create 
best-of-breed analytics tools to compete with the mutli-billion dollar corporations that already produce 
comprehensive suites in this area. 
 It’s potentially dangerous for a beacon vendor to claim analytics as a core part of its beacon offering. It 
could end up producing a toolset that is so poor that it reflects badly on the rest of the package and drains 
resources from adding value in other areas that might be a more realistic focus. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CHOOSING THE RIGHT BEACON
102
 Worse, by claiming to operate in this area, vendors could alienate the ecosystem partners that they 
should be integrating with, that do focus on analytics. This could have the effect of removing the alternatives 
to what may be a sub-par analytics offering. 
 Does that mean the vendor should offer nothing in the way of analytics? No. There is a good argument 
that a beacon vendor should provide some basic dashboard tools that provide a quick, simple, economic 
way of understanding the use of the beacons. This can be done without declaring war with the analytics 
software industry. 
 The analytics heavyweights are not as agile as some of the beacosystem players. There are beacon-
specific features that an analytics giant like SAS may not address for some time. Being able to interpret 
what a number of low-level beacon triggers mean and express those low-level details in ways that can be 
understood by other tools offers opportunities. For instance, the ability to group a collection of beacons that 
cover a department in a store and to export the fact that there was dwell time in men’s apparel, rather than a 
mass of entry and exit triggers from disparate beacons, could be very helpful. 
 As solution designers, we should look for evidence of integration between a given beacon vendor’s 
middleware and the analytics providers’ infrastructure. We can be sure that this integration will be painful 
the first few times it’s done, so having “plugins” between a beacon vendor’s tools and a broad selection of 
analytics tools is of significant value.  
 Integration Points 
 Analytics tools are just one example of where a beacon vendor can establish value with proven integrations 
with third-party tools. Other examples of integration points we may find interesting are with what we call 
 orchestration  tools  (campaign management and content management), other beacon networks, advertising 
networks, and third-party apps. If a beacon vendor is providing a platform, they are likely to be a lot more 
successful if they can point to a large catalog of third-party applications and software. It’s surprising that very 
few of the vendors in this space can provide a solution directory that lists those partnerships. 
 One proxy for assessing adoption of a beacon provider’s platform by independent software vendors is to 
understand how many developer kits a beacon vendor has sold. Beacon vendors tend to directly equate the 
number of developer kits sold to the size of their ecosystem. This is optimistic. Often they don’t know if the 
purchaser of the beacon is an adolescent hobbyist, or the architect from a Fortune 500 company working in 
stealth mode. The number of developers using the beacon vendor’s development kits is important. If it’s low, 
that’s bad, but if it’s high, it doesn’t necessarily mean that software packages have been developed for the 
platform and that production systems are going to be rolled out on it. The platform that was originally used 
for the proof of concept is not necessarily the one used for the production system. It’s not unusual to see 
customers buy beacons, learn, and then “jump ship” once they become smarter.   
 Company 
 If you are buying a commodity, the kind of company you source from is not that significant. If you are buying 
ball bearings or beef, so long as the quality is good, it doesn’t matter so much who you buy from. 
 Despite the existence of standards, beacons are not a commodity, so the opposite is true. The moment 
you start building your solution, your source of beacons becomes really important. 
 Why? In the case of beacons, there are proprietary hooks that introduce unique ways of doing things. 
This introduces switching costs as soon as you start to invest your company’s time into designing the use 
of those hooks by your solution. You aren’t buying a static product. With software changes in the OS and 
firmware updates within the beacon, your platform will evolve. So, there are a number of factors about the 
company and its approach that you should consider. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CHOOSING THE RIGHT BEACON
103
 Financial Viability 
 Most companies selling beacons are startups. Nearly all of them are burning more cash than they are 
making. So the one thing we can be confident of is that they will not be the same companies in two years’ 
time. They will either have found a way to generate profits and be self-sufficient, or they will have been 
bought or merged with another company with a complementary business. We have to ask ourselves, is their 
current focus likely to be profitable or is it a stepping-stone to an adjacent market that will be profitable? 
There isn’t a lot of money to be made from simply making beacons, so look at the beacosystem stack we 
reviewed earlier and ensure that you understand where they will extract value. 
 Is the answer to buy your beacons from a larger company? That may give you political cover, but the reality 
is that big companies can shut down underperforming divisions or sell them to companies that might not be 
organizations with which you want to do business. PayPal was one of the first major companies to produce a 
Bluetooth beacon. It was a beautiful looking product and the rationale for its existence made sense; it enhanced 
their payments system. They deployed it in trials, changed their leadership, and then decided the product wasn’t 
viable. There are rumors of a warehouse filled with PayPal beacons that have never been unpacked. 
 At one extreme, we have visited beacon vendors with palatial offices situated on expensive real estate. 
Some vendors have big teams, including industry veterans, who are clearly being well paid. Both of these 
may be impressive to us as prospective customers, but are signs of a high burn rate. Other areas for concern 
are players that are trying to develop everything themselves. None of these factors is a disqualifier, but they 
raise questions about how the vendor pays for these overheads. 
 At the other end of the spectrum we see smaller teams with offshore developers. We see teams that 
have started their development with a consulting services strategy that has validated their focus and funded 
their growth. We see companies that have focused on a sub-segment, done well, generated either volume or 
even cash, and then started to grow into adjacent areas. Until the beacosystem matures, investors in beacon 
hardware need to think like venture capitalists and consider the fortunes of the company they are investing 
their own capital into, even if that capital is not money but their reputation, time, and opportunity to lead. 
 The key questions that need to be answered are, how does this business intend to make money, how 
fast do they appear to be burning through their capital (political capital or money), and how realistic are 
their plans? 
 From this perspective we would want our supplier to be commanding the kind of pricing premium that 
will allow them to make money. Our next criterion reverses this perspective.      
 Cost 
 When looking at  costs of beacons, the equation is more complex than the unit price of the hardware. 
 An area to consider is one we have already touched on; whether a single beacon can accommodate 
all the required protocols or frame types. Some deployments have wanted to support both Eddystone URL 
and iBeacon protocols and have ended up deploying two beacons next to each other to achieve that. That’s 
certainly a cost driver. 
 Consider both the capital cost and the recurring cost of any services that may be charged. These 
recurring costs could be for the monitoring, fleet management, or conditional access. Some beacon vendors 
will bundle geofencing and other value-added services such as analytics and orchestration services. This 
may reduce expenses elsewhere, or be redundant depending on the design of the rest of the solution. 
 Another component is the cost of replacing batteries, or the wiring required for powered beacons. 
Materials and labor can vary significantly. 
 A fundamental question to consider as a multiplier of cost is the density of beacons required. A few 
beacons are all that is required to indicate presence, but to deliver pinpoint accuracy and location in X, Y, 
and Z axes many more beacons are required. If navigation services are all that is required based on a rules 
engine, then the number of beacons may be at a mid-point between these extremes. If the requirement 
is for triggers near specific points-of-interest, then that will drive your calculations in a different way. The 
numbers will be driven by the use-cases that you want to support.  

CHAPTER 7 ■ CHOOSING THE RIGHT BEACON
104
 Supply Chain 
 Even Apple with a  supply chain guru as CEO, mountains of cash, decades of experience, and huge clout with 
its suppliers has problems matching supply of its products with demand. Imagine the challenges for your 
beacon vendor. They have none of those advantages. They may have a ready supply of the processors and 
power supplies, but if the plastics they require have a lead time, or their contract manufacturing partner has 
other priorities, they may not be able to switch up supply from the trickle of developer kits to the thousands 
of beacons required for your project. 
 Maybe you don’t need thousands of beacons. If you only need a hundred beacons, does that mean you 
don’t need to worry? Unfortunately you still need to consider scenarios where your shipment is held hostage 
because a much larger customer is in short supply.  
 There is no magic solution to this challenge. The key is to be aware of the risk, get a sense of your 
beacon vendor’s business and behavior in the market, communicate with your vendor, and don’t leave it to 
the last moment to place your order. 
 Developer Community 
 While the current state of play continues and developers use the beacon vendor’s SDK to integrate with their 
products, each beacon vendor needs to develop relationships with an ecosystem of software and services 
partners to build out the beacosystem software stacks into complete solutions. These stacks will provide the 
apps and all of the other layers of functionality we define in the beacosystem stack. 
 To the extent that your requirements are fully defined, you can make sure that all the pieces you need 
work with your beacon vendor’s platform. Given that requirements change in unpredictable ways, you will 
want to have evidence of a broader set of solutions that are ported to your beacon platform.  
 Partners 
 Beacon vendors can’t do everything themselves. In addition to their developer community, it’s useful 
to understand the ecosystem of other partners that they can make available to you. Is there a choice of 
reputable systems integrators that have experience with their products? 
 Other types of  partners include advertising agencies that can help bring advertisers that might be 
interested in your venue’s beacon-enabled infrastructure. 
 Do they have partners that can help with the logistics of deploying and servicing beacons on a large scale? 
 Is your beacon vendor partner friendly, or are they trying to do everything themselves? Do they have 
competing products that might taint their ability to recruit partners to build out their ecosystem? Do they 
have people responsible for their partnerships? What do the partners say about the shortlisted vendors you 
are considering?  
 Relationship with  OS Providers 
 One of the most important partnerships your vendor will have is with Apple and Google. In addition to the 
specifications that Google and Apple publish to describe iBeacon and Eddystone, there is information that 
is not public. The mobile OS behavior can change in unpredictable ways. A major beacon vendor will have 
relationships with insiders at Apple and Google to help them gain access to the unpublished information 
and respond to the unexpected changes to the mobile OS. 
 Beacon vendors should be able to demonstrate their participation in pilot projects working with the 
OS companies, early availability of support for their new standards, and even the names of the people with 
whom they have relationships. A strong relationship with the OS companies can help mitigate risk to your 
project and ensure that the best approach is being adopted with the services you require. Evidence of this 
kind of thing will help you to decide whether you are dealing with a tier one vendor or not.  

CHAPTER 7 ■ CHOOSING THE RIGHT BEACON
105
 Vertical 
 Beacons address a wide set of  vertical markets from automotive, banking, retail, hospitality, real-estate, 
transportation, theme parks, advertising, logistics, education, museums, events, hotels, and tourism. On 
which verticals is your beacon vendor focused? If the answer is all of them, then the reality is they have no 
focus. Unless their resources are truly vast, in order to provide the necessary features, partners, and best 
practice, they must have a focus. 
 Quality 
 Quality of the beacon product has varied significantly between vendors. Some have a poor record of 
reliability. Their products are delivered with a significant percentage dead on arrival, with others failing after 
a short period. Other quality issues manifest themselves as inconsistency in signal stability and strength. 
 These issues often become visible in pilot projects. Word gets around. Some vendors may actually track 
their reliability and can quote Mean Time between Failure (MTBF) numbers. If they aren’t measuring this, 
then that is a cause for concern. 
 Culture 
 The  culture of companies in the beacosystem varies widely. Some are easy to do business with and are 
flexible, others are regimented sticklers for strong contractual agreements. Some companies are very 
guarded in discussing their results and plans, and others are transparent. It’s up to you how you interpret 
these signs. Robust contracts show a sign of maturity and level of quality that will result in smooth 
acquisitions in the future. Your vendor should be busy. So there should be limits to what they are willing to 
do to accommodate one customer. In early markets like the beacosystem, you are likely to be spending more 
time with each other than if this market were really mature, so it might be well to put your lot in with a team 
that you like. 
 Geographic Coverage 
 Even though beacons should work anywhere in the world, they still need local certification, support, sales, 
and partner management. It quickly becomes obvious if your vendor is covering your current geography, but 
it’s worth considering the ultimate scope of your deployment and making sure that your vendor of choice 
addresses all those markets. 
 Intellectual Property (IP) Position 
 There is a broad range of patent filings that read against beacons. Since very little money is being made in 
these early stages of the beacosystem, it doesn’t make sense for anyone to waste time with patent litigation. 
Many entrepreneurs don’t think it’s good use of time to cross license each other’s IP until they have a proven 
business model, but the time may come when it’s worth considering this eventuality, once you have made 
your millions. It sounds bad, but in a sense patent litigation would be a good problem to have, since it 
indicates that players in the beacosystem are making money. 
 Your beacon vendor will have exposure to competitors who have patents that they probably have not 
licensed. It’s useful to understand the patent filings that your vendor has made; this can help establish a 
balance of power, or a bargaining chip to settle disputes. Ideally the Bluetooth SIG and the OS venders will 
manage this issue as they have the lawyers and patent portfolios to best equip them to provide defensive 
cover for their developer community. In the case of the SIG, today beacons sit on top of the Bluetooth stack 
and so the “do not sue your fellow member” provision of the Bluetooth agreement doesn’t apply. While the 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CHOOSING THE RIGHT BEACON
106
OS vendors probably won’t indemnify you (defend you in court if you get sued for using their product), there 
is some strength in numbers if you use their protocols. Make sure in your beacon supply agreement that your 
supplier is offering IP indemnification. 
 Volume 
 The manufacture of Bluetooth beacons is not a boutique or craft business. Unlike the makers of luxury 
automobiles, musical instruments, or fine chocolates, we are not talking about an  artisanal process   where 
dedicated craftspeople hone the delivery of a small number of beacons that have been polished and 
seasoned to perfection. 
 If a beacon vendor is not moving large  volumes of product  , it’s unlikely they will have a close 
relationship with the OS vendors who control their destiny. Without volume, it’s even more unlikely that 
software vendors will adopt their platform. In a low-margin business, you do need to make it up in volume in 
order to be viable as a business. The companies acquiring the best-of-breed beacon vendors will be looking 
for a high volume of sales too. 
 It’s easy to produce a poor beacon. Buy the module from your silicon vendor, limit the value add 
software, the protocols, the management tools you provide and you can get a product out there. If, as 
a beacon vendor, you want to be able to do the hard work of filling all those gaps, it’s going to require a 
significant cash flow to fund it. That flow of cash comes from sales volume.  
 Some Notable Providers 
 There is no one vendor who covers all the bases, supporting every feature that every solution designer would 
need. Solution designers who want a structured listing of capabilities should use our sister resource, the 
 Proxbook.com database, to get the latest information about vendor capabilities. It would be an easy “cop out” 
to leave it there. 
 In order to avoid that, we have gathered a list of vendors that we think are notable, that we have had 
occasion to become familiar with. This is a sample out of the hundreds of companies competing with each 
other that we think you should consider. 
 With each we will discuss the things we like and the tradeoffs, or “development areas,” that we see. 
Consider these criticisms as you would the barbed jokes in a comedy roast. We wouldn’t be saying these 
things if the target weren’t a significant player worthy of respect. 
 Just because a vendor isn’t listed here, doesn’t mean to say they are not worthy of consideration. Life is 
short, as is our attention span. So we have not enumerated every example of the distinctive types of vendor 
called out here. Enough of the disclaimers … 
 BluVision 
 BluVision are one of the contenders for the title of “beacon vendor that has sold the most product,” with 
over one million beacons shipped in 2014. They have done this through a focus on two verticals, personal 
beacons for helping individuals finding lost items under their Stick’n’Find brand and their success in selling 
to a major logistics/shipping company. This was for an application where beacons were used to track the 
movement and care of valuable shipments. Unlike Tile, which sold even more beacons, tracking key rings 
and lost bicycles, 
 BlueVision provide beacons for venues too. They leverage the volume and cash flow from tracking 
assets to build a position in a market that is more about recurring services revenue. 
 Their expense burn rate appears to have been well matched to their revenue and they haven’t had to 
raise significant venture capital in their first couple of years of operation. We first met their CEO when he was 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CHOOSING THE RIGHT BEACON
107
staffing a small booth at the Bluetooth SIG conference. He seems grounded, frugal, and in touch with the 
business, willing to do the marketing work that other chief executives might think is below them. 
 When Google launched Eddystone, BluVision were one of the first six to be selected to support the 
standard. That OS vendor relationship is key. 
 Their hardware product portfolio is comprehensive with powered beacons and battery powered 
beacons with a sizable capacity. They also provide a Wi-Fi to Bluetooth bridge for remote management of 
beacons. 
 BluVision has invested in its software stack. They have experience with fleet management of large 
numbers of beacons; they have the conditional access layer that is required to control who can see a beacon. 
 Their brand lacks the slick graphics and playful industrial design of Estimote. Perhaps it is their location 
in Florida or their down-to-earth culture that has kept them out of the media spotlight, as compared to 
Estimote and Gimbal. Our estimate is that their developer portfolio and number of customers is smaller 
than some of the tier one vendors they are competing with. That raises some risk to their ongoing revenue 
stream. Their acquisition of elements of a beacon orchestration module, the marketing layer that developers 
can build on to save themselves time and cost, may also be a turn-off to other software developers that they 
compete with in this space. BluVision’s challenge is building the developer ecosystem on their platform that 
they need to succeed in the long term and breaking into verticals where their beacons are stationary and can 
form a network that can be monetized across multiple software vendors. 
 All of these challenges are manageable and fairly obvious, so we are excited to see their progress.  
 Estimote 
 Estimote has succeeded in capitalizing on having its development and management team based in Poland 
in order to manage costs, while projecting an image of the ultimate Silicon Valley startup. They have 
beautiful products that compete with major film starlets in their regular appearance in magazine, blogs, and 
journals. The visual appeal extends beyond their product and its packaging, through to the materials on their 
web site. The Estimote diagram of how iBeacon works in a retail environment should get its own YouTube 
channel, it has been spread across the Internet that much. As a result, their web site has been visited more 
often than any other beacon hardware company in the first two years of the iBeacon ecosystem. 
 This has been backed up with cultivation of probably the largest community of developers in the 
beacosystem using their SDK. We believe Estimote have sold more developer kits than any other beacon 
vendor. 
 Managing beacons using their iOS app is very straightforward, with simple access to the controls to 
change all beacon parameters. 
 They have added UUID rotation and support for Eddystone to compete with other tier one vendors. 
Given the huge volume of developers on their platform, they have a solid basis for relationships with the OS 
vendors. This was evidenced by their being in the first tranche of partners that Google announced as having 
Eddystone support. 
 Estimote adds value with an Indoor Location API that allows the simple mapping of a room with 
beacons placed on each of the walls and then offers near real-time user positioning within the mapped 
space. 
 Their product range addresses developer and personal applications with a sealed beacon using a 
CR2477 coin cell battery and an “Estimote Stickers” product, shown in Figure  7-13 , where 10 very thin 
beacons are embossed with icons to indicate the objects they can be attached to (e.g. bike, dog, car, and 
laptop) in order to track them. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CHOOSING THE RIGHT BEACON
108
 While Estimote is arguably the leader in cultivating a developer ecosystem, the areas where Estimote 
has received criticism can be summed up as a product range lacking robust enterprise quality. 
 Their philosophy appears to center on the premise that the beacosystem is in the pilot stage and so if a 
beacon battery is exhausted, the device should be thrown out and replaced with the latest model.     
 They currently have no powered/plug-in beacons or Wi-Fi management hubs. Their maximum battery 
capacity is relatively small, topping out at the CR2477 coin cell level. As mentioned previously, when that 
battery is exhausted, the only way it can be replaced is if the beacon case is cut open with a knife. The plastic 
case is substantial, so that’s no small task. 
 Historically their quality control has been poor, with a high failure rate on arrival and after a period of 
use. The calibration of their beacons has been inconsistent, so that one beacon may behave differently from 
another in the same batch. This may have been addressed as they have gained more experience. 
 Other beacon vendors such as Sensoro and Gimbal have positioned their antennas as being of a 
higher quality, yielding greater range, and a more stable signal, which results in more predictable proximity 
measurement. 
 All that said, none of these issues is insurmountable. Having the largest developer ecosystem is a very 
significant advantage. New products that address enterprise requirements can be deployed quickly. Creating 
the largest base of developers cannot. I have spoken to solution providers who have been delighted by their 
experiences working with Estimote’s product. 
 Facebook 
 Facebook’s launch of its Bluetooth  beacon is one of the most exciting things that has happened in the 
beacosystem. This is not a quick-and-dirty market test. The industrial design and packaging are beautiful. 
 The strategic implications for the beacon market are significant, especially as we look at the rise of the 
beacon network phenomenon we will discuss later. The Facebook beacon has the potential to be a great 
success. However Facebook isn’t likely to be selling its beacons for use by anything other than its own app 
any time soon. Solution designers looking for a short list of general-purpose beacons can cross Facebook off 
their list, for now at least. 
 We will revisit Facebook in the beacon network chapters.

 Gimbal 11 
 Beacon vendors can be split into two categories based on their genesis. Those born in the bedrooms, 
garages, incubators, the habitat of the start-up, and those that grew out of the lab, office cube, or meeting 
room within an established corporate player. Gimbal is in the latter category. It was incubated within 
Qualcomm, the largest producer of mobile semi-conductors in the world. 
 As a result, it has enjoyed a lot of the privileges that go with an aristocratic upbringing, having been 
cultivated by experts in their respective fields of hardware design, manufacturing, legal, cloud software, and 
business development. Gimbal had a lot of experiences in its youth that were denied to many less privileged 
beacon companies. It got to go to all the best sporting events (the Super Bowl and stadiums of all the major 
sports leagues) and parties (South by South West); it was exposed to culture (LACMA) and as a result of its 
parent’s status it was introduced to business heavy weights (Google and Apple). It had a privileged place in 
clubs (the Bluetooth SIG). As a result of all this, it developed a sense of confidence that doubtless has helped 
it to gain further success, but may be off-putting for some. It’s probably also true to say that as Gimbal was 
carved out of Qualcomm, it brought with it a lifestyle and a spending rate that was higher than a startup 
pulling itself up by its bootstraps. Like any offspring from a privileged background, the expectations are high 
too. It puts pressure on the team to drive revenue sooner, to scale larger, and to look for the big win. 
 What does this mean specifically? Gimbal can probably claim more high-profile pilot wins than any 
other vendor. Its beacons are in all the U.S. Apple stores, the first U.S. national retail deployment of a general-
purpose beacon. They have deployed hundreds of beacons around New York City in partnership with Titan. 
Their partnerships with major app vendors, such as RetailMeNot and Shazam, have been significant. Their 
experience with deployments by major advertising agencies in Japan was formative.  
 Their hardware lineup is comprehensive, with personal tags (the $5 S10), enterprise grade beacons 
(the S21, shown in Figure  7-14 ) with robust battery capacity (four AAs), a powered USB device, and less well 
known Bluetooth to Wi-Fi hub, although that is not a formal part of the hardware lineup (think of it as being 
on the secret menu, like Animal Style Fries at In-n-Out). 
 11  Full disclosure: As noted elsewhere, the author worked at Qualcomm as Senior Director of Strategy for Qualcomm 
Retail Solutions, the division that incubated Gimbal prior to its carve out from that company.  

CHAPTER 7 ■ CHOOSING THE RIGHT BEACON

 The Gimbal cloud software stack may be the broadest in the industry. The product is based on a 
marriage between a context platform (the original Gimbal product) that predates the introduction of 
beacons. So it includes robust geofencing, a messaging component to send alerts to users, as well as profiling 
of individuals based on their movements, tracking their most popular destinations. More recently, Gimbal 
acquired the Phigital platform, which added what we would describe as an orchestration layer to manage 
the experience that is delivered by apps using Gimbal beacons. 
 Gimbal’s vision of building networks of beacons is exciting and ambitious. 
 The downsides of working with Gimbal can be inferred from their strengths and heritage. Major 
customers with money to spend will feel in good company. Smaller players may find it harder to get 
attention. 
 While most of Gimbal’s peer group have a Fortune 500 company behind them, Qualcomm no longer 
has a majority equity share. So unlike beacon companies such as HP, SK Planet/Shopkick, Zebra, and 
Facebook, we don’t know who will ultimately own Gimbal. It’s unlikely it will disappear—there is too much 
value—but companies sensitive to the agenda of a potential acquirer may be concerned. The departure of a 
number of key executives (and to be fair, the arrival of a cast of well qualified replacements) suggests there is 
considerable pressure to achieve results that may not have been fully realized. 
 For a solution builder that simply wants to buy hardware and create their own cloud platform to 
support a network strategy or middleware offering, there may be some challenges in reconciling strategies. 
 Gimbal’s hardware is very competitively priced because by default they charge a monthly active user 
fee. This isn’t unfair, given the depth of cloud service functionality available. While the structure of the fee 
may change, this model may not be acceptable to solution builders that simply want high quality hardware. 
 Figure 7-14.    The Gimbal S21 is powered by four AA batteries and has software selectable directional and 
omnidirectional antennae 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CHOOSING THE RIGHT BEACON
111
 Lastly, to satisfy their ambitious vision, Gimbal’s market focus has been quite broad, which means a 
lot of the functionality is broad based, which makes it a good fit for developers building their own vertical 
solution. However, end users looking for a one-stop shop may find other beacon vendors have a more 
focused solution. Gimbal’s success is therefore predicated on their ability to partner well with third parties. 
 Gimbal feels like the offspring of a very demanding parent. When most kids would be happy with an A-, 
the Gimbal team flinches, because they know that only an A+ is acceptable. 
 Kontakt.io 
 Kontakt.io represents a different model from Gimbal; one could say the opposite approach. It has 
established its strength in the European market, where it has a leadership position. Kontakt.io’s presence is 
becoming more established in the United States. 
 They have focused on monetizing beacon hardware rather than charging for active users, or building 
out a beacon network. Like Estimote, Kontakt.io is headquartered in Poland. Their image is rooted in a focus 
on cause-based solutions, with a founding story that relates to providing assistance for blind people with 
beacon-enabled mobile apps. 
 The  Kontakt.io hardware is distinguished by a Wi-Fi to Bluetooth gateway or cloud beacon (Figure  7-15 ) 
and a robust weather-resistant tough beacon. 
 Figure 7-15.    Kontakt.io cloud beacon provides a management gateway between its Bluetooth beacons and 
the ability to monitor and manage via Wi-Fi       
 Kontakt.io was among the first vendors to support both Eddystone and iBeacon protocols. While their 
industrial design is not as conspicuous as Estimote, they have a well organized developer program with the 
most regular production of video content to guide entrants to the beacosystem. 
 There are limitations to their beacons’ power options. Their beacon and tough beacon both rely on 
CR2477 thick coin cell batteries, which limits the battery life to six months when broadcasting at Apple’s 
prescribed 100ms interval. 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CHOOSING THE RIGHT BEACON
112
 While their initial offerings have been free from monthly recurring charges and their pricing is 
reasonable, the question is how they will generate revenue beyond the small margins from hardware?  
 Sensoro 
 If Gimbal’s geographic  strength  is the United States and Kontakt.io’s is Europe, Sensoro’s strength is Asia. 
Headquartered in China, they have capitalized on the size of that market to lay claim to having deployed 
more beacons in venues than any other vendor (110,000 as of Q4 2015). They have announced the following:
 The network spans 25 movie theatres, 16 airports, 39 high-end retail stores, 40 major 
tourist destinations, 200 universities, 260 high-speed trains, 1,500 Pizza Hut restaurants, 
and 2,100 Chow Tai Fook (CTF) jewelry retail stores among other locations. 
 These are significant volumes. The deployment in the Chow Tai Fook jewelry store leverages the 
communications app WeChat, which claims 600 million active users as of August 2015. 
 Sensoro  claims that its beacons triggered proximity experiences that resulted in an amazing 63% 
coupon conversion rate during a campaign that prompted customers to shake their phones when they 
entered stores to reveal special offers. 
 We would argue that the “network” aspect of this announcement is more aspirational than a reality 
today. A third party can’t yet programmatically gain access to all these beacons to launch a campaign, but no 
other vendor is as well positioned to achieve this in China as Sensoro is. 
 Sensoro’s hardware has a reputation for quality antenna design, with a strong stable signal. They are 
unusual in having dual antennae, with a selectable short-range antenna that is designed to enable triggers 
when phones come within a few centimeters of the beacon. 
 As well as the aesthetically-pleasing Yunzi beacon (see Figure  7-16 ) that runs on a CR2477 coin cell 
battery, with a light sensor that can be used to trigger an energy saving mode, Sensoro offers more plainly 
packaged beacons that run off USB power, as well as the two 4xAA battery options. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CHOOSING THE RIGHT BEACON
113
 Sensoro  offers support for Eddystone and iBeacon protocols. It also offers an encryption technique to 
prevent unauthorized use of beacon UUID identifiers. 
 Currently beacon status, configuration, and software updates are achieved via an Inspection app. Going 
forward, they have announced a “station” that uses an additional radio technology to manage beacons 
within a much wider radius than can be reached through Bluetooth. 
 Sensoro has a small but significant staff presence in the United States and has a partnership with 
Microsoft, one of their original investors, which has helped raise their visibility and paved their expansion 
into the United States. They sold significant numbers of beacons to Google, which earns them a claim 
to have those all-important relationships with at least one of the key mobile OS vendors. They also have 
credible deployments at SeaTac airport, the Seahawks stadium, and a number of local museums. 
 U.S. customers must satisfy themselves that this satellite operation can support them adequately. With 
engineers in another time zone, and communications challenges when bridging the firewalls imposed by the 
Chinese government, this can raise issues if the kind of project being contemplated is pushing boundaries 
  Figure 7-16.    Sensoro’s Yunzi beacons being used at a Real Madrid/Inter Milan match with more than 40,000

CHAPTER 7 ■ CHOOSING THE RIGHT BEACON

where collaboration across time zones is required. While the author has been impressed by Sensoro’s 
responsiveness, we have had challenges getting communications to penetrate China’s firewall. As they 
increase their presence in the United States, their challenge will be to replicate their success with WeChat in 
other apps with the same reach in the United States. 
 Sensoro  beacons are competitively priced. As of writing this, however, the shipping costs to the United 
States are significant for small unit volumes. That said, the cost of beacons may not be relevant. Their 
executives understand the value of building a true beacon network, where they own the hardware and seem 
open to waiving charges for hardware in order to establish placement of their beacons in key venues. Venues 
with significant traffic may find Sensoro willing to invest in funding the cost of beacons in their location.  
 Shopkick, Swirl, and inMarket 
 All of these vendors have significant experience with offering beacons. While  Shopkick ,  Swirl , and 
 inMarket al l provide beacons, they don’t sell them as a commodity product to third-party developers. Their 
hardware is offered as an integral component of a retail services offering. 
 This recognition that the money is in the services, not the hardware, is smart but unfortunate. 
Shopkick’s beacon is one of this author’s favorite beacons. It is probably the largest beacon on the market, 
due to the sheer mass of the batteries that are packed into the device. 
 All three vendors have good experience with mass deployments in retail environments and were early 
to market with techniques to obfuscate the UUID of their beacons. 
 They have claimed support for iBeacon and benefit from those hooks into the OS to support the 
applications that use their networks, but because they don’t service the general-purpose developer 
community as hardware vendors they haven’t felt the need to be first in line to offer support for Eddystone. 
 We will explore their offers further in the beacon network chapters.  
 Quuppa 
 Quuppa is a very distinctive technology company based in Finland. Founded by ex-Nokia researchers, it 
offers what may be the most accurate Bluetooth beacon location technology on the market today. 
 Quuppa  achieves extraordinary levels of precision, down to a small number of centimeters in some 
cases. They do this while tracking movements at high speed, plotting the location of their Bluetooth beacons 
in close to real time. Visualize ice hockey players skating at full pelt around a rink, with a beacon attached 
to the puck rocketing between them. The players and the puck can all be tracked in the digital world, with 
graphical displays that keep up with the real-world action. 
 Quuppa does this with proprietary receivers, or “locators,” that use angle of arrival technology across 
an antenna array. Angle of arrival measures the difference in timing of the arrival of a signal across different 
elements of an antenna. If the signal arrives at the same time across all elements, it can be deduced to be 
perpendicular to the antenna array. As that angle changes, the timing and the phase of the arrival of the 
signal across the antenna differs. Based on computing that angle, the position of the signal source can be 
deduced (see Figure  7-17 ). 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CHOOSING THE RIGHT BEACON
115
 Figure 7-17.    Quuppa’s locators calculate the angle of arrival of a signal to deduce the position of a Bluetooth 
beacon 
 These antenna arrays aren’t like the sprawling antenna systems deployed by the Germans to plot the 
approach of enemy aircraft during World War II (Figure  7-18 ). They are housed in a sleek Frisbee shaped 
device.  This device requires a power connection. A single antenna can track location in two dimensions; add 
a second one to track in 3D.

116

 Quuppa is a small company (seven key staff) that works through value-added resellers who build 
complete solutions around Quuppa’s technology. 
 While the level of precision it is able to achieve is remarkable, it’s important to understand the 
implications of this approach. In all the other cases we have discussed here, the beacon detection is being 
done by a consumer’s phone, and uses signal strength to measure proximity to the beacon, whose position 
is fixed. With Quuppa, a stationary antenna array device (see Figure  7-19 ) is calculating the location of a 
beacon, which is the mobile component. 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CHOOSING THE RIGHT BEACON
117
 This means that you need beacons on the objects or people that are being tracked. Of course phones 
can be programmed to become beacons. In which case, they can be tracked too. 
 There are some potential issues with consumers who may not want their phones to be activated in this 
way. This may be due to a number of perceived issues, including privacy and an inability for iOS devices 
to listen for other Bluetooth devices while transmitting as a beacon, but these are probably manageable. 
Attaching dedicated beacons to shopping carts in a retail use-case mitigates these risks, and also has 
the benefit of eliminating the need for shoppers to have a smartphone, download an app, and grant it 
permission to use location services. 
 The key difference with the conventional beacon approach is that there are more upfront infrastructure 
costs with this approach. The Quuppa locators are more sophisticated than a simple beacon and cost about 
the same as a Wi-Fi access point to purchase. They also need the same power and networking connections 
as those devices, which involves greater installation costs. A 100,000-foot big box store might need of the 
order of 100 Quuppa receivers. So if all the venue needs is simple proximity alerts, the  Quuppa  solution 
is likely to be overkill. If there is an ROI on calculating accurate location, the upfront investment may be 
justifiable, especially as the maintenance costs of the fixed “locator” devices is lower than battery-powered 
beacon devices (no battery replacement or manual updating of firmware is necessary). 
 For tracking players on the field, “residents” in correctional facilities, people and assets in healthcare, 
along with retail heat mapping and wayfinding, the Quuppa solution has some exciting potential. 
 Beacon Grid 
 Beacon Grid’s flagship beacon isn’t battery powered and it doesn’t plug-in, rather, it is the plug, or 
BeaconOutlet TM  that other devices plug into (Figure  7-20 ). This infrastructure approach is similar in 
philosophy to that of Acuity, Philips, and GE Lighting, which believe that Bluetooth beacons should be a 
feature within the wiring of a building. Rather than being built into the lighting system, Beacon Grid provides 
  Figure 7-19.  The Quuppa receiver or locator device contains an antenna array used to pinpoint beacon 
location 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CHOOSING THE RIGHT BEACON
118
power sockets with a couple of radios inside. The advantage they claim is that their beacons can broadcast 
with more power, with a higher packet frequency, and with more types of packet, than their battery powered 
competitors. They integrate a Wi-Fi radio into their package, so that their beacons can be managed remotely 
and so they can provide a bridge from Bluetooth to Wi-Fi, to monitor third-party, battery-powered beacons. 
 Figure 7-20.  Beacon Grid beacons integrate within a U.S. power socket 
 As with other directly powered beacons, the location of their product is less flexible, but that still leaves 
a wide range of applications that can be addressed. 
 Although they are still a startup, Beacon Grid is seeing traction in a number of verticals. Their beacons 
have been integrated into systems for monitoring presence in offices and multi-dwelling units. They can 
provide information to better optimize heating and cooling, so that the HVAC (Heating, Ventilating, and Air 
Conditioning) systems only spend energy on conditioning the temperature in a room when there are people 
present. The physical security and ubiquity of sockets (people aren‘t likely to steal them) makes them a good 
fit for security applications, such as informing the e911 system where an emergency call is coming from, or 
fulfilling the same function for collage campus security, where students can summon help using an app in 
circumstances that might not warrant a call to 911. 
 Another interesting security application is to authenticate the presence of a person’s phone as part of an 
electronic system. They can allow access to secure documents via a wireless device, but only if it’s within the 
secure area of a government building. 
 Beacon Grid sees itself as a BaaS (Beacon as a Service) business where it charges a monthly fee for 
use of a BeaconOutlet, providing additional value with fleet management and asset tracking services, 
and integrations with the third parties that provide complete office, hotel, airport, and secure document 
applications. This is a prudent and exciting business model for them and for investors. For their customers 
they need a rock solid ROI to justify the $12-$40 a month that Beacon Grid charges as list prices (for small 
quantities).  
 Zebra 
 Zebra was one of the first “grown-up” companies to make and sell beacons and, among other things, offers 
a more stable source of supply than many other younger companies in this space. By “grown-up” we mean 
Zebra is over 40 years old, and is a relatively large, public company, with over 7,000 employees, global reach, 
and billions of dollars of revenue. 
 Zebra’s name comes form its origins as a pioneer in barcode printing. Since then they have acquired 
capabilities in UWB, RFID, and Bluetooth beacons, through the acquisition of Motorola Solutions, the part of 
Motorola left after the company split and sold the handset business to Google. It has a broader base of retail 
technologies than most providers in this space. 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CHOOSING THE RIGHT BEACON
119
 Zebra is an example of an interesting class of beacon company, the Wi-Fi infrastructure provider 
(think Cisco, HP/Aruba, and Ruckus), using Wi-Fi access points as a means of managing a fleet of Bluetooth 
beacons. 
 Its beacon hardware range, MPact, encompasses USB-powered, CR 2450 coin cell and 2xAA batter units 
that can be controlled from a central Wi-Fi enabled server. They have succeeded in recruiting another major 
beacon vendor, Swirl, to use their beacon hardware by offering support for Swirl’s proprietary SecureCast 
protocol. This protocol allows access to beacons to be regulated. 
 Their MB2000, AA-battery powered beacon is one of the few such devices that uses a directional 
antenna and uses “a next generation chipset” that should yield a two-year battery life even when 
broadcasting at 100ms intervals. 
 The platform includes location and analytics software. Zebra has done a good job of emphasizing its 
ecosystem partners (Coffee Bean, Phunware, Swirl, Aisle411, Localpoint by Digby, Codigo, and Retailigence) 
who have built on the Zebra platform in ways that other beacon vendors have struggled to do. 
 Zebra’s  strengths may also provide clues to its weaknesses. It is surprising that there is a lack of case 
studies and announcements of customer deployments using this comprehensive platform. One can only 
guess that with its size, the fog of war associated with the Motorola acquisition and the sheer breadth of 
its offering, that a lack of focus may be causing it to move more slowly in converting its existing customer 
base over to beacon technology. Having account managers with existing relationships based on purchases 
of other products is hugely valuable, but with it comes opportunities for internal politicking and change 
management issues that smaller companies don’t experience to the same extent. 
 If Zebra’s executives continue to believe in the opportunity and succeed in generating the profits 
to justify that patience, the company could be well placed to service accounts that appreciate its many 
strengths. These include breadth of product, size, focus on beacon management, and being a supplier with a 
more certain future. 
 Summary 
 Beacons are a fairly simple hardware component in a proximity solution with many layers. The vendors 
stand on the shoulders of silicon manufacturers who provide them with an impressive baseline platform to 
build on. There are hundreds of beacon vendors to choose from. However, if you consider the criteria we 
have described in this chapter, it’s possible to select a small number that have the hardware, software, and 
business profile to deliver what is needed for your solution to be successful. 
 Along with selecting which beacon to use come questions about deploying, what could be, thousands of 
wireless devices. These devices have to support a set of applications that are new and will probably change 
over time. How do you prepare for that? This is the next question we consider in our  Hitchhiker’s Guide to the 
Beacosystem .

 Beacon Deployment 
Considerations: The 10 Ps 
 
 
   “Fasten your seatbelts; it’s going to be a bumpy [ride]!” 
 Bette Davis,  All About Eve (1950) 

CHAPTER 8 ■ BEACON DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS: THE 10 PS
122
 For technologists used to creating software and cloud services, the act of deploying beacons in the physical 
world, at scale, may be one of the most unfamiliar aspects of creating a beacon solution. 
 For our brethren (and sisteren) who deploy software-only technology solutions, life is relatively simple 
by comparison. Sure, they have to worry about staging their software and pushing it from development to 
production servers, but all this occurs in a fairly controlled datacenter environment, where the external 
factors are at a minimum. We, on the other hand, are bridging the digital to physical divide. This means that 
we still have to do all that software stuff and we also have to carefully situate these digital cookies (beacons) 
out into the physical world—very large numbers of them. 
 These beacons may be distributed across large swaths of unfamiliar territory, where lots of people 
believe they have control and we don’t. What we are doing is more akin to what  AT&T has to do when 
rolling out a new cell phone network. AT&T has to select sites, perform construction, and deal with the 
unpredictability of what happens to signals when the environment interferes with theoretical plans. Anyone 
who has suffered a dead zone in cell coverage knows how hard building a wireless network is. 
 In the future, when large multi-tenant networks of beacons have been deployed for us in advance, 
access to beacons will be achieved by selecting the beacons that interest us from a web console. Life will be a 
lot simpler. More on that in Chapter   13 , “Understanding Beacon Networks.” 
 Until then, welcome to the critical path, where lots of things can go wrong and there isn’t much upside. 
How often do we expect a shopper to say, “Great job placing that beacon”? Will we get a call from the 
mayor’s office to thank us for consulting with them on privacy issues when deploying beacons in the public 
space? Probably not. 
 So job one is to set your stakeholders’ expectations on the size of the task and what could possibly go 
wrong when deploying thousands of beacons. Hopefully when the beacons are all in place and they trigger 
the app as expected, when small children don’t steal them, and the bomb squad is not called out to defuse 
the beacon, you will get the praise you deserve 1 . 
 How do you assess the magnitude of the task at hand when deploying the beacons? The goal with this 
chapter is to provide you a checklist of things to consider. Coincidentally, many of those factors can be 
grouped under headings that all begin with the letter “P” (see Table  8-1 ). Hopefully this makes it easier to 
remember them.

 There is no substitute for experience, so we have included in this chapter direct quotes containing 
recommendations and lessons learned from the deployment engineers at Point Inside and  Gimbal  . These 
engineers have experience with beacon deployments at the top U.S. retailers, major sports venues, and 
events such as the Super Bowl and South by Southwest. We end the chapter with a case study from a 
deployment of over 1,000 beacons across a set of large shopping malls. 
 Planning 
 Let’s start at the top. Having an executive sponsor whose authority spans all the organizations required for 
your project’s success is important. 
 Sponsorship 
 You will need to communicate with and motivate people in lots of different functions, people who control 
the physical domain in which you will be placing the beacons, operations, facilities, marketing, and lawyers, 
to name a few. These people will feel their authority is being tested when this new technology attempts to 
“break on through to the other side,” from the digital to the physical. Most organizations are built on inertia. 
When you start doing something different, some people will be excited, but many others will feel challenged. 
By breaking out of the pure software domain and placing beacons in places they haven’t gone before, you 
are going to require cooperation and tolerance from many more functional stakeholders. The last thing you 
need is one of those stakeholders to feel their job is to hit the stop button on your project. Having a senior 
executive sponsor, someone who everyone wants to please, who is vested and reviewing progress, is the best 
way to mitigate these issues. 
 Cross-Functional Briefings 
 Having your executive support in place is not enough. Plan to confer with all the department heads and 
influencers whose cooperation you may need. If you can pick their brains, learn from them, and make this 
project theirs so it’s a group win, all the better.
 This is very critical. Often teams try to get beacons deployed in a few stores with minimal 
involvement from cross-functional teams. While that may work out, it almost always 
results in major hiccups when moving from a pilot stage of a handful of locations to a 
full-blown beacon rollout. Encourage your customers to involve all the right stakeholders 
and give them the right knowledge to get sign-off from different departments in their 
organization. (IT will need different info than Store Operations.)

 Communications Plan 
 Point Inside is a specialist indoor location services provider to top-tier U.S. retailers such as Target and 
Walmart. Their  StoreMode platform is beacon-independent and provides way-finding, analytics, and 
product-locator functionality to retailer apps. Their deployment team had this to say:
   Don’t underestimate the amount of communication needed to the stores. On a number of 
occasions, we have installed beacons and the next day come in to be told they were removed 
because they didn’t know what the beacons were. It is hard for stores to communicate 
everything to ALL employees. Start early, share visuals, explain the value, and use creative 
methods. 
• 
 Use internal company communication sites. 
• 
 E-mail store managers and line managers directly. 
• 
 Send a beacon care package in advance for the managers to see the product. 
 All these activities will enable boots on the ground leadership to get the communication out.  
 Point Inside Deployment Engineering 
 Site Survey 
 Survey the site, or sites, where your beacons are going to be deployed. Do this as early as you can in the 
project cycle. Software, hardware, and processes may be impacted by what you find.
 Deployments seem easy, especially when the tech team is familiar with the product, having 
used them for months before hitting the store. When you finally get to do your first test in 
the store, time yourself and your group through the installation. You may quickly realize 
6-8 labor hours are needed per store to accomplish an installation—who pays for this cost 
across 1,000 stores?  
 Point Inside Deployment Engineering   
 The right beacon management tool can assist in streamlining the planning and deployment process.
 Avoid hard coding locations, e.g. departments, into your beacon setup. Beacons represent 
a point on a sales floor—product will change underneath it—so should the messaging. 
Point Inside’s StoreMode platform helps in this regard by digitizing your space (product 
and location) and removing any hardcode between the point and the products around it. 
Beacons can then be set once, and product can be set in many ways.  
 Point Inside Deployment Engineering   
 On the site visit, step through the use-cases from an app user’s perspective, as well as from the 
deployment team’s perspective. Talk to the people who work there, give them a preview of what’s going to 
happen, and get their feedback. 
 Note where the beacons will go, recording each location, and consider the instructions that will be 
needed to enable that process. Make sure you understand the people whose cooperation will be needed. 
Consider the placement and propagation issues we will detail later. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ BEACON DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS: THE 10 PS
125
 Involve a local subject matter expert, for instance the store manager. They will have a good sense of 
what’s gone wrong with deployments in the past. Being able to cite their input will be useful when you return 
to base and have to change plans that people may want to be left untouched. 
 A site survey serves three purposes:
• 
 Find the best beacon placement for mobile apps triggering off a reliable 
beacon signal. 
• 
 Find the best placement location to fit the aesthetics of the physical location.  
• 
 Arrive at a process that can easily be replicated across as many locations as possible. 
Having a custom install per location is not feasible or scalable. 
 The third point is often overlooked. While you may have the right talent and tools to deploy 
across a handful of locations, you have to understand that a nationwide rollout usually 
means people unaware of what beacons are may be involved in the install process. So it is 
critical to arm them with very simple-to-follow instructions and pictures that allow them 
to easily install beacons correctly. The synonym I often use is, ask the store manager “What 
is the process you follow to install a new poster at every store in the country?” While that 
may seem like over-simplifying the process, it gives you a good sense of how the customer/
brand carries out similar operations across hundreds of thousands of locations.

 Floor Plan 
 One of the key documents you will need to copy or create is a floor plan. Floor plans may come from a  CAD 
system (Computer Aided Design), a corporate source, or they may be something that is held locally. 
 On one occasion we sourced such a document from the local store manager of a Staples we were 
surveying. We had no agreement with corporate HQ, but we did have our pocket protectors and laptops out 
and seemed to be official enough that he was happy to cooperate. 
 Some floor plans will be posted in public places simply to show the location of fire exits, for example, 
by the elevators in hotels.
 Without digitizing the store space, beacons can and will move, get misplaced, or otherwise 
go missing. Digitization enables a clean placement plan, a digital record, and visualization 
of beacon locations for easy “findability” and further through mobile analytics, allowing 
retailers to understand the health of their network. 
 We create a digital index of each store for our retail customers. This is the digitized 
understanding of a store space, which is a crucial starting point for a beacon planning 
project. 
 Point Inside Deployment Engineering   
 The deployment of HP Aruba beacons at Levi’s Stadium in San Jose was impacted when the hundreds 
of TVs in the club section of the stands were replaced. The beacons were plugged into the USB ports on the 
TVs in order to take advantage of the placement and power, but when the TVs were swapped out, hundreds 
of beacons went missing. The  Aruba Meridian sitemap   helped to track the holes in the deployment so they 
could be replaced.

 Sizing the Number of Beacons 
    A very important aspect that should be part of planning your beacon rollout strategy is 
anticipating how mobile applications will trigger off the beacons. This is the single most 
important point that gets missed. Often a significant disconnect between teams deploying 
beacons and software engineers developing the mobile application leads to undesired user 
experiences. 
 Gimbal Deployment Engineering 
 Forecasting the number of beacons required to support your deployment is a highly visible and 
potentially critical element of your plan. Lots of people are going to be interested in this number. At the front 
of the line will be the finance person who has to budget for this and, of course, the salesperson selling you 
the hardware. 
 The numbers can get very big, depending on the number of venues, their size, and the use-case. 
This number can be very simple to forecast or quite the opposite, complex and the source of high anxiety. 
Let’s consider some use-cases and their impact on these numbers. 
 The  Check-In Use -Case 
 The number of beacons the  Gas Buddy app needs per convenience store is simple, one per store. This is 
driven by their use-case, which is to see how many people who received an ad in their app go from the gas 
station forecourt into the convenience store. In other words, they are measuring   door swings . For Shopkick, 
who measures the same thing—door swings driven by their app—the number of beacons is larger, because 
the venues they service (Macy’s, Target, and Walmart) tend to have multiple entrances. When the  Shopkick 
app measures how many American Eagle customers enter the changing rooms after being offered an 
incentive of “Kicks” points, they needed a second beacon in addition to the one by the store entrance to 
cover the changing rooms. 
 Considering use-cases where we are measuring traffic by a billboard or vending machine, then the 
numbers are simple, one per object where the app is “checking in”. In the case of Apple’s trailblazing 
deployment of beacons in the U.S. Apple Stores, the numbers were slightly bigger per store because there 
were numerous proximity check-ins, one at the entrance and one for each of the accessory displays. 
 In the case of a sports arena, you may have a beacon at the entrances, at each of the concessions, and by 
points of interest about which you want to provide information. 
 So the check-in use-case is simple. Right? Not always. Checking into meeting or conference rooms that 
are close to each other can be problematic. This is the case when the walls between the rooms don’t block 
the propagation of the Bluetooth signals sufficiently to differentiate the location of two people sitting a few 
feet apart on either side of that wall. If the wall between the rooms is a wooden screen or a thin piece of 
plasterboard, this can be problematic, as the beacon signal can pass through these structures. 
 This issue can be mitigated with more beacons at a lower signal strength on either side of the permeable 
barrier, and/or enough beacons to do trilateration using extra logic in your orchestration or mapping layer. 
If you are sitting in a room with multiple beacons, there is a better chance of getting a less ambiguous fix on 
where you are seated. 
 The  Wayfinding Use-Case 
 This solution brings us to “location,” the use-case that makes forecasting the number of beacons more 
challenging because the variables are more complex. If our goal is to go beyond a simple check-in and to 
track movements to draw a heat map or to plot a green dot on a map, then the density of beacons goes up. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ BEACON DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS: THE 10 PS
127
 The variables include:
• 
 Square footage of the location. 
• 
 Algorithms your location system uses. A rules-based guidance system like 
BlindSquare should require fewer beacons than a system that uses trilateration 
like Indoo.rs. 
• 
 Stability of signal. Different beacons vary in the stability of their signals. 
• 
 Signal strength. A lower signal strength will result in less overlap in signal, 
but will require more beacons to cover a given area. 
• 
 Accuracy required. Higher accuracy generally requires more beacons. 
• 
 Proximity of alternative locations that need to be differentiated. Consider, 
for example, corridors that run close to each other.    
 In challenging locations, an iterative process of testing, followed by adjustment of beacon locations, 
can resolve issues where location fixes are not consistent. 
 For benchmarking purposes, lets consider an example of a large location use-case deployment. Indoor.
rs used over 300 beacons to implement wayfinding at San Francisco International Airport, Terminal 2, 
which is 640,000 square feet. That’s one beacon per 2,000 square feet. The density of beacons most likely 
varied depending on what part of the terminal was being mapped. In a location near the TSA barrier, where 
proximity is key but no physical wall exists, more beacons are likely to be required. If the location is an 
empty/isolated corridor, fewer beacons would be required. 
 Looking for a rule of thumb? When reviewing journals you see rules of thumb that vary significantly. 
The CEO of ByteLight posited that a 102,000 square feet Walmart store (the average size) could need 
32 beacons for coarse-grain estimates of the department a shopper was in, ranging up to 320 beacons for 
wayfinding. That’s a range of one beacon per 3,187 square feet, to one per 319 square feet. At the top end, 
this could be an expensive proposition. Given 4,800 Walmart stores, that’s over 1.5 million beacons, or $15m 
of capital expenditure, assuming the beacons cost $10. 
 Other vendors might argue that this is a pessimistic estimate, that fewer beacons would be required. 
ByteLight’s perspective may be framed by their ability to deploy beacons as part of LED light fixtures, which helps 
resolve some of the cost and maintenance issues, since their beacons are powered by the light fixture. In addition 
to the up-front capital costs, think about the cost of replacing 6 million AA batteries every couple of years.
 While it is possible to come up with rough estimates, as much as possible, never give out a 
number unless you have at least done one or two site surveys. Even after doing hundreds of 
beacon installs, you always get surprises when you walk into a new physical location. If the 
use-case is basic like described in the Gas Buddy use-case, you can easily say one beacon 
at the entrance will do the trick. But anything beyond that will require you to survey a 
location [and] run some signal tests to estimate what is the quantity of beacons required. 
 Note that most big customers actually will not cringe at the beacon quantity. Because it is 
a one-time cap-ex cost and the cost of beacons continues to go down, the hardware cost is 
not the biggest source of concern for the customer. However, if there aren’t enough beacons 
or if there are too many beacons, which can cause challenges from determining proximity 
of user to the beacon, the software costs to make an application work can add up very 
fast and the risk of a poor user experience is more important to a brand. So always be 
prepared to back up your beacon quantity with very clear reasoning and map them to as 
many use-cases as possible.

 Documentation 
 Depending on how big your deployment is and who is going to do what, you will need to create 
documentation for each of the players. Make it short and people might even read it.
 Add photos as much as possible of how the beacons would look after they are installed in 
that location. Pictures speak a thousand words. 
 Gimbal Deployment Engineering 
 Training 
 If users of your app will have to do anything that is specific to using the functions triggered by the beacons, 
then plan to train the staff. When Apple deployed a beacon-enabled version of its Apple Store app, their 
training was very good. Most staff understood what the beacons were there for and the functionality it drove 
within their apps. 
 Training retail staff is challenging. The technical skill and motivation of retail employees varies widely. 
Some retailers invest extensively in staff selection and training, have strong store management, and low staff 
turnover. Others do the opposite. It can be extremely challenging to train retail staff to support a new mobile 
program if all these elements are not in place. It can be very exciting to close a deal with a retailer, but if you 
are relying on the local staff to do anything at all to support your app, be brutally honest in assessing the 
retailer’s ability to execute its part of the program. Lastly, unless your application is going to be used very 
regularly (as the  Starbucks app is and the ISIS/Softcard payment app was not), any knowledge from the 
training has a short half-life and will atrophy within a small number of weeks.
 Another important part of training is to inform the staff of what the beacon does and any 
questions/concerns they may have around being in the presence of RF signals for a long 
period of time. Beacons themselves are extremely low-energy devices and the signals they 
transmit are several fractions to the tune of those emitted by mobile phones that users 
carry around all day. It is also good to clarify any misconceptions about beacons tracking 
people—beacons do NOT track people; they help detect the proximity of a user only if the 
user has opted into a specific mobile application. 
 Gimbal Deployment Engineering 
 Placement 
 There are some advantages that come with height. If you are thinking of running for president, you are more 
likely to win if you are the taller candidate 2 . Beacons benefit from lofty elevation, too. 
 A beacon placed high has the benefit of being out of reach of people who might want an electronic 
souvenir of their visit to a venue. Most importantly, height maximizes coverage of an area and minimizes the 
attenuation and signal fluctuations that come from signals being absorbed by people’s bodies. 
 2 “Between 1900 and 2011, 18 of the winning [presidential] candidates have been taller than their opponents, while 8 have 
been shorter, and 2 have been of the same height. On average, the winner was 1.0 inch (2.5cm) taller than the loser.” 
 en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heights_of_presidents_and_presidential_candidates_of_the_United_States 

CHAPTER 8 ■ BEACON DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS: THE 10 PS
129
 You can have too much of a good thing. If the beacon is too high, geometry starts to work against 
you, especially if what you want is a very localized proximity trigger. As you can see in Figure  8-1 , in a high 
ceilinged building, like a warehouse, with a beacon at 20 feet, it’s unlikely that there will be sufficient change 
in signal strength to differentiate between distances that are within a five-foot radius under the beacon. If the 
goal is to detect a five-foot change in proximity to a particular product display, placing a beacon at a lower 
height is advisable. 
 A higher placement also has the inevitable consequence that should physical access be required for 
battery change or a reboot, ladders or elevated platforms need to be deployed. At this point, additional 
facilities staff may need to be involved.
 Place beacons in a manner that will not cause additional operational overhead when the 
physical layout of the place changes (as an example, if a retailer has to change their store 
layout for different seasonal collections).  
  Another factor that often gets overlooked, especially when installing beacons high on 
ceilings/walls, is to test for bleed between floors. In multi-level stores and even in some 
stadiums, we have seen bleed between floors. That can throw off your use-case completely. 
So it is important to include that in your test considerations when looking at beacon 
placements.  
 In most cases, if you want to detect presence of users in a certain zone, installing it 7-8 feet 
from the ground level works out well. If you go higher, you run the risk of minimizing your 
beacon reach. Too low and you run the risk of people interfering with the beacon signals. 
 Gimbal Deployment Engineering   
 Figure 8-1.  A five foot movement from beneath a beacon elevated to 20 feet above the level of a phone will 
result in a 3% change in distance, a change so small that it is unlikely to register in terms of predictable change 
in signal strength

 Be Prepared for Placement 
 Bring installation tools, extra tape, cleaning supplies, Velcro, scissors. Seems simple, but 
having a clean surface with a secure connection between the beacon and its surface pays 
off in the long run—otherwise, your beacons can quickly end up on your floor.  
 Point Inside Deployment Engineering 
 Propagation 
 
 
 Test, Test, Test. Beacons are RF devices and RF behavior can different significantly based 
on physical environment. Behavior observed in a lab is very different from that seen in a 
retail store, which is different than that in a sports venue.  
 Gimbal Deployment Engineering 
 Signal Bounce and Multi-Pathing 
 Taming a Bluetooth signal is reminiscent of “Tommy” the “Pinball Wizard,” blindly trying to direct a steel ball 
that is rocketing off hard surfaces in an unpredictable way. 
 Bluetooth signal paths don’t always go in straight lines and can bounce off walls. When a signal 
bounces, it can be directed at angles that cause the signal to manifest its presence in places that are 
unexpected, resulting in a false positive, or a beacon triggering an event in a location that it should not. 
When the signal bounces and is detected along with the signal that has taken a direct path, this is known as 
 multi-pathing and can result in signal fluctuations that make measurements less stable. 
 These effects can be mitigated with use of directional antenna (not a panacea), through adjusting the 
orientation of the beacon, and through reducing the signal transmission strength and metal shielding.  

CHAPTER 8 ■ BEACON DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS: THE 10 PS
131
 Shaping Signals 
 One of the most challenging signal-taming projects this author has experienced was placing beacons in gas 
pumps. These beacons were to be used for payments, so that a customer could stand in front of pump #1 and 
pay for their gas with a cloud payment app, without having to specify that location. Fuel dispensers have two 
sides that are very close to each other. We needed beacons on either side of the pump to register phones on 
one side but not the other. The two sides were not insulated from each other in a way that prevented 
a co-mingling of electromagnetic waves. The potential result of this was that someone standing in front of 
pump #1 could end up paying for the gas being pumped at #2, on the other side of the island. 
 Our temporary solution was to purchase two metal switch boxes from Home Depot (see Figure  8-2 ) and 
to place one beacon in each box, fixing the two boxes on the inside of the plastic fascia of the pump, so they 
were facing outward. The boxes cost pennies and proved to be excellent shields. Suddenly we had a clear 
separation of the signal from the two beacons going out of one side only. 
 Some appliances, like vending machines with metal cabinets, can form their own shielding for shaping 
a directional signal. This is useful if you have multiple vending machines next to each  other  that need to 
keep their signals separate. Unfortunately, more often than not existing cases have holes and vents, which 
provide opportunities for signals to escape and multi-path around the room. The metal switch box is a crude 
but effective solution in such cases.
 In some cases, it is just not possible to control a beacon signal to your liking. This is where 
software comes to the rescue. Having the ability to “ignore” beacons seen beyond a certain 
signal strength can alleviate the need to achieving your use-case solely with perfect beacon 
deployments. Your beacon deployments can be “good enough” if you have software that 
allows you to control when your application can and cannot react to seeing beacons.

 Procurement 
 You would be forgiven for assuming that, with a few weeks’ notice, your beacon supplier will ship the 
beacons you order. 
 In the words of Felix Unger from the 70s TV show  The Odd Couple (Figure  8-3 ), “You should never 
assume. You see, when you assume, you make an ass out of you and me.” 
 Be extremely cautious and make sure that you are forecasting your needs and have clear expectations 
on lead times for exactly the kind of beacons you need. If you need large volumes, have clear confirmation 
from someone at an executive level in your supplier that your order can be delivered in the timescale on 
which you are depending.
   You will need to procure the tools and supplies for the install (ladders, tape, mounts, phone 
with a test application to test beacon signals). 
 Also, in addition to achieving volume, you need to know if the supplier has the capability 
to ship individual orders of beacons to several different locations. In most cases, the 
beacons don’t go to a single warehouse but end up being shipped to individual locations. 
This “packaging” can include a set number of beacons along with an instruction sheet for 
individual store managers, for example.

 Permission 
 You are the official responsible for the safety and security of a government building. Such buildings are 
vulnerable to terrorist attacks. A strange electronic device mysteriously appears, stuck on the wall. No one 
knows where it came from. It doesn’t look like anything you have seen before. What do you do? a) Ignore it 
and take the risk that it’s not an explosive device, or b) Follow procedure, evacuate the building, and call in 
the bomb squad. We know the answer. 
 Let’s image the aftermath of this real-life situation. It happened in London. Do we think that, those 
executives in charge of the operation of the government facility a) Had a bit of a chuckle, appreciating that 
the evacuation and resulting disruption made for a nice break for everyone concerned, or b) Channeled the 
anger and frustration of the people whose day was disrupted and really let the people responsible “have it”? 
 It’s worth conferring with someone in the know at the venue, as to who needs to give their permission 
for a beacon deployment. It always seems there are a lot more people who feel they should be in a position 
to say “No” than “Yes,” but tempting as it may be, that shouldn’t dissuade you from notifying them. 
 At an airport for instance, the list of people who need to buy in, or at least to be informed, may include:
• 
 IT: They will probably be on the core team 
• 
 Marketing: Responsible for presentation of this service 
• 
 Public Relations: Ready to explain to the press what’s happening 
• 
 Security: See above 
• 
 Terminal Operations: Responsible for the successful operations of the terminal  
• 
 Facilities: If you are going to be using ladders and installing things, they should be 
your friend 
• 
 Concession Management: Given retailers’ interest in beacons, they should be aware 
of what your are doing 
• 
 Airline Management: Since airlines have a stake in beacon-enabled apps, arm the 
folks responsible for those relationships with what you are doing 
• 
 Legal: Chief counsel, privacy, contracts 
• 
 Contract Management/Procurement: As well as your contract, there may be 
agreements with other parties who have exclusive rights for certain wireless services, 
so these folks will need to be on board and confirm that no other agreements are 
impacted by what’s being done 
• 
 Finance: They are holding your purse strings  
• 
 The Executive Team 
• 
 The Board: You don’t want to surprise a board member with something that may 
generate public debate 
 This list will be different for each vertical market and organization. In retail, the merchandising 
team will be a key constituency. In petroleum retailing, the relationship among the oil companies, the 
convenience store franchise brand, and the franchisee can be complex and fragmented. This can make 
deploying systems in that vertical very challenging. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ BEACON DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS: THE 10 PS
134
 Stakeholder maps always seem to be more complex than outsiders would imagine. Whatever the 
vertical, mapping out those stakeholders and getting buy-in up-front will save you time.
 Another thing that is helpful is to carry some extra beacons to leave behind with the 
appropriate authorities. Often it is helpful to give them the ability to show off the beacon to 
any additional people who need to approve and, plus, you have a much better chance of 
success when one of the customer employees can speak to the beacon and its functionality 
themselves! 
 Gimbal Deployment Engineering 
 Privacy/Public Notices 
 Look hard in a retail store and you will probably see public notices about the operation of surveillance 
cameras (along the lines of Figure  8-4 ). 
 Despite the fact that beacons only broadcast and don’t track people directly, the reality is that they 
enable apps to track people with a level of intimacy that is comparable with cookies in browsers. In certain 
regions, it’s mandatory to declare your use of these cookies on web sites. 
 Given these two precedents, you would be wise to take the high road, do the right thing, and err on the 
side of full disclosure. 
 Consider placing signs that explain how the beacons are being used. These don’t need to be 
billboards. It may save a lot of hassle down the road and increase the defensible position you have should a 
Congressperson challenge your program. The senior privacy lawyer at your venue will have as an objective 
keeping their CEO from having to testify in front of a Congressional Committee about their company’s abuse 
of privacy. Respecting that goal and making them a friend will pay you dividends.

 Process 
 Keeping track of which beacon was placed where will be key. If this is a  process , it won’t be a problem. 
Decide up front if you are going to:
• 
 Place the beacon and then program it based on a preexisting addressing map.  
• 
 Program the beacon first and then place it at a predetermined location.  
• 
 Program the beacon, place it, then make a record of that location. 
 Or place the beacon, enable it in the application, and then look at incoming application 
data to reverse engineer where the beacon may have been placed. This can work only in 
certain scenarios like when there is a single beacon in a location. Otherwise, documentation 
is key. It is also helpful to label beacons with a ID or name allowing the person responsible 
for maintaining the beacon to easily identify the beacon. 
  Define a process for maintenance (replacement in case for failure, replacing batteries, 
firmware upgrades).  
 Gimbal Deployment Engineering     
 Power 
 If you have a single beacon that is being used for a check-in to your venue, having that beacon powered 
may be viable. This is what Gas Buddy does. Because their use-case is simple and convenience stores are 
generally quite small and separated from competing stores, it works. They don’t have to worry about battery 
life and the replacement process for batteries, which is a huge benefit. 
 Shopkick’s beacons can be in stores that are close to each other, so beacon placement becomes more 
critical. They moved from a powered audio check-in device to a  battery-based Bluetooth beacon. Part of the 
rationale was to avoid the cost and complexity of having to run power to the beacon. As one of the first firms 
that has done national deployments of beacons across multiple retailers, that says a lot. 
 The vendors of LED lighting are in strong position to offer their services as a beacon provider for venues 
that need to be blanketed with beacons. They can offer a relatively low-cost way of powering beacons that 
are already fitting into a Bluetooth mesh network that’s in place to control the lights. The complexity of 
coordinating a beacon deployment with a lighting refit works against them, but having a built-in power 
source is a compelling advantage. If your ROI is strong and the use-case is very well established, perhaps you 
can make the case that a powered beacon infrastructure is worth the up-front cost. 
 Given this is the exception rather than the rule, look for beacons with bulging battery packs and take 
advantage of the ease of deployment that you will have gained. 
 Presentation  
 When conferring with the stakeholders who control your venue, the way your device fits into the look 
and feel of the venue may be very important. Some categories of venue will be very relaxed; others will be 
manically controlling.

 Gimbal beacons are generally white, but the ones in the Apple store are silver. One can infer that 
this customization of the color of their product for a single customer was not done lightly. Changing the 
appearance of your beacon can take time and planning. Be careful that efforts to conceal your beacon don’t 
interfere with their operation. For instance, hiding beacons under metal shelving can create issues with 
unwanted signal absorption.
 Beacons are not supposed to stand out in a physical location. Be it a retailer, a sports 
venue, or a museum, it is important that beacons just blend into the existing environment. 
 Gimbal Deployment Engineering 
 People 
 Who will deploy your beacons? On a small scale the answers are relatively easy. If the there is a single 
beacon that needs to be deployed for a simple check-in use-case, mailing the beacon in a package with really 
clear instructions and a tested process that is as simple as pulling a tab, peeling off a label, and pressing the 
beacon on a wall could work. It’s even more likely if the person receiving the beacon is highly motivated to 
make the program work. Facebook has done a good job with the instructions, packaging, and design to make 
that feasible for its beacon. 
 If there are strong unions in place, you may have no choice but to use their workers to deploy the beacons. 
 As soon as the number of beacons increases and the placement becomes more critical, the question 
requires some consideration. Relying on retail shop assistants to do this, or even on their managers, may 
not be the best course of action. Fortunately, deploying technology in venues is a common requirement 
and it’s possible to piggyback on an established network of companies that service point-of-sale equipment, 
or perform merchandising (shelving displays) installation. Typically they have processes to track such 
deployments to make sure the work has been done.  
 Case Study 
 The following are edited responses to a questionnaire that we shared with a solution provider who deployed 
1,400 beacons across six shopping  centers in Switzerland. 
 Systems Integrator/Software Developer:
• 
 Codeparc LLC;    www.codeparc.com  
• 
 Michael Rava|CEO 
 Venues:
• 
 Six shopping centers, each with 50 stores on average.  
• 
 Each center has its own app. The backend can aggregate all data into one 
consolidated picture. 
 Use-cases:
• 
 News (based on users’ interests), location information, promotions and games. 
 OS:
• 
 iOS and Android 

CHAPTER 8 ■ BEACON DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS: THE 10 PS
137
 Beacon access controlling used (e.g., rotating UUIDs)?
• 
 Yes. We protect the apps from spoofed beacons. 
 Number of beacons deployed:
• 
 Between 150 and 250 per center, with another 100 per center due to be installed. 
 Beacon manufacturer:
• 
 Kontakt.io, which was chosen for battery life, configuration options, hardware 
design, and service. 
 Frame types/protocols broadcast:
• 
 Currently Kontakt.io/iBeacon. Eddystone maybe depending on market acceptance.    
 Planning 
• 
 Our client performed extensive surveys in advance to defining user preferences and 
requirements. They provided us with PDF floor plans. 
• 
 We calculated the number of beacons required based on testing at our headquarters 
and in-depth research on location, assessing the building structure and adjusting the 
plan based on local conditions. 
• 
 Center management, marketing planners, building technicians, engineers, and 
developers were all involved in the deployment. 
• 
 We provided plans and briefings for our customer in writing. Training is planned 
(on location). 
 Placement 
• 
 Beacon placement balanced cosmetics and access for maintenance, while keeping 
them out of reach, so they are not interfered with or stolen. 
• 
 Center technicians and center facility services performed the hardware deployment. 
 Propagation 
• 
 We had a few challenges with signal bouncing and interference. We made 
adjustments in beacon placement to deal with the effects of building materials and 
windows. 
 Procurement 
• 
 There were no issues in getting the number of beacons we wanted when we needed 
them. We ordered early. 
• 
 The key is to plan, order, test, implement, and have a contingency supply of spare 
beacons. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ BEACON DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS: THE 10 PS
138
 Permission 
• 
 We informed the customer’s Property Management and Center Management about 
the project in great detail in advance. 
 Privacy 
• 
 Based on Swiss law, there were no privacy concerns that necessitated physical 
signage. For the beacons to be used, visitors must install the app on their 
smartphones and are presented with a privacy statement when they start using 
the app. 
 Process 
• 
 The beacons were programmed in advance of the deployment and then placed at a 
predetermined location. 
 Power 
• 
 We started with battery-powered beacons. Powered beacons will follow probably 
in 2016. 
 Presentation 
• 
 Depending on the color of the environment, we used white or black beacons.

 At the moment, health monitoring is built into our consumer apps. However, we 
have plans to change that by 2016 where we will implement cloud-beacons to 
perform monitoring and updates. 
• 
 Center Facility Management will change batteries. 
• 
 Codeparc will do firmware updates manually or through cloud-beacons. 
 The acceptance of the new technology has been very positive. It’s been important to provide customers 
meaningful benefit they couldn’t get otherwise. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ BEACON DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS: THE 10 PS
139
 Summary 
 The 10 Ps provide a basis for preempting many of the issues that need to be navigated. A large-scale retail 
deployment is like whitewater rafting. We all have a general idea of what needs to be done—wear a life jacket 
and try not to hit any rocks—but having a guide who has done it before is advisable. That guide may be a 
consultant, it may be someone within the venue, or it may be a partner. So while Bette Davis was right—this 
can be a bumpy ride—with the right tools and some preparation, it can also be a fun one. 
 In the next chapter, we will look at some of the tools that can help manage your fleet of beacons as they 
are deployed.

 Designing with Management 
in Mind 
 
 
 Question: Lions gather in prides, geese group in gaggles, there’s a murder of crows, and a 
leap of leopards. What’s the collective noun for a group of beacons? 
 Answer: Planes, trucks, ships, and beacons all come in “fleets”. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DESIGNING WITH MANAGEMENT IN MIND 
142
 The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines “chaos” as:
 “Complete confusion and disorder, a state in which behavior and events are not controlled 
by anything.” 
 With thousands of beacons being deployed across chains of stores, cities, and entire countries, it’s easy 
to see how chaos could ensue in the absence of a robust management system. Imagine what would happen 
if beacons were lost; if they started to fail; if their software needed to be updated or their configuration 
changed and there were no tools to manage this. 
 In the previous chapter, we discussed the process and planning required for a successful deployment. 
Now, let’s look at some of the tools that can be used in that process. The goal here is to examine the state of 
the art of beacon fleet management, explore what can be achieved with it, and understand how four of the 
leading tools work. 
 In this chapter, we will describe:
• 
 Functions that are offered by beacon fleet management solutions and the 
architectural approaches 
• 
 Standards 
• 
 A sample of some of the most popular products that are used for fleet management: 
Estimote, Gimbal, and Sensoro 
 This will arm you, as solution designers, with the knowledge to evaluate and select an approach that 
makes sense for your situation. 
 Fleet Management Functions 
 First, let’s look at the functions performed by beacon fleet management tools in general terms. 
 Inventory 
 Beacons can be deployed in large numbers, with each of them performing a different function. Done 
carelessly, this immediately creates a logistical nightmare. Therefore, as we place our beacons on site, we 
need to be able to keep track of them. To do this, most fleet management systems track a device’s unique 
serial number or MAC 1  address. This number is hardcoded and, unlike the  UUID  , is unrelated to where 
or how the device is used. Other attributes that need to be tracked include the logical addresses (UUID), 
firmware version, parameter settings, location, whether the location has changed, signal strength, broadcast 
packet frequency, battery level, and other contextual metadata. 
 With a growing number of beacon standards, the inventory database needs to track multiple address 
formats, be they the iBeacon UUID, major and minor device numbers (UMM), an Eddystone-UID, UUID 
and Instance ID, an Eddystone URL, the AltBeacon ID, or the beacon OEM’s own proprietary ID. 
 The location information may be merely the latitude/longitude, but increasingly has started including 
a dispatchable street address, which will often include a floor level. Some systems even plot the beacon 
location against a floor plan of the building. 
 1 A Media Access Control (MAC) address is a unique number defined and assigned in blocks by the IEEE to equipment 
manufacturers, who then use the addresses to identify each product they make. The MAC address uniquely identifies 
network elements and is used across different communication protocols such as Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and Bluetooth.  

CHAPTER 9 ■ DESIGNING WITH MANAGEMENT IN MIND 
143
 Many systems also enable contextual metadata tags to be associated with a beacon. These can be used 
to record that the beacon is in a certain part of a store, say, the men’s shoes department, or the identity of a 
particular billboard, or an association with a certain painting in a museum. 
 For beacons with accelerometers, it’s possible to track whether the beacon has been moved since it was 
placed. This can be useful to know, as unauthorized and unnoticed movements could cause serious issues. 
 Information about battery level and the metadata from sensors is also important to track online. Most 
beacons are not connected permanently to networks, and are thus not accessible at all times (unlike many 
other network elements). So this information is typically a snapshot of a measurement that was relayed 
when the beacon was last inspected. This status information can be gathered by passing apps designed to 
report that information back to the fleet management system, or, in more advanced cases, relayed by some 
kind of Wi-Fi or other network bridge that occasionally pings the beacon.  
 Configuration and Updating 
 Address and configuration parameters will need to be set as part of the deployment process. These changes 
are often performed with a mobile app, but the process that is used varies a lot. In some cases, the app will 
be a special management app. Sometimes the app will configure the beacons one at a time. Others will take 
a bulk approach to updating multiple beacons in a batch. Some beacons will need to be physically reset to 
change the parameters; others can be changed over the air with no physical intervention. Several vendors 
offer Bluetooth to Wi-Fi bridge products, so no app is required with them. 
 Some beacon vendors provide configuration and monitoring functionality in their SDK so that a 
consumer app can be used to perform these functions. For example, a Happy Hour app used to find 
bars with great deals could use beacons to trigger a check-in at the bar. Once checked-in, the Happy 
Hour app could initiate a beacon update. This might occur if the beacon was flagged as being in need 
of a configuration change. While this might go unnoticed by the users, should they find out their data 
charges have been increased by shipping software updates to a retailer’s beacons, this has some potential 
satisfaction/legal issues associated with it. 
 Using Wi-Fi for Beacon Management 
 Most of the  Wi-Fi infrastructure vendors (for example, Aruba, Cisco, Ruckus, and Zebra) are now adding 
Bluetooth radios to their Wi-Fi access points. With these in place, the vendors’ management tools can monitor 
and in some cases manage the configuration of Bluetooth beacons, as well as fulfilling their main purpose of 
providing Wi-Fi connectivity for any device, including the smartphones running beacon-enabled apps. 
 Generally providing good wireless connectivity infrastructure and beacons go together. Very few 
beacon-enabled apps work well in communication black spots. So these Wi-Fi vendors have an advantage 
over the beacon startups entering this space, as they have well established sales and support channels. 
They are seen as a lower-risk supplier whose future is more certain, and they can consolidate the beacon-
management function with that of managing the Wi-Fi network. 
 Some of these vendors make their own beacons and can configure them via their access points 
(see Figure  9-1 ). Unfortunately, due to a lack of standards, it’s rare for a Wi-Fi access point vendor to be able 
to configure third-party beacons. Even so, the Wi-Fi access point vendors are in a position to grab a portion 
of the beacon market, annexing it into the market where they are already well established. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DESIGNING WITH MANAGEMENT IN MIND 
144
 A prime example is Aruba Networks, which is owned by HP. Aruba manufactures Wi-Fi access points 
and Bluetooth beacons, and provides the Meridian cloud-based beacon management system (see Figure  9-2 ), 
which also includes app creation tools that enable the creation of wayfinding and “blue dot” functions within 
an app. 
 Figure 9-1.  HP’s Aruba LS-BT1 Bluetooth beacons can be monitored, configured, and updated via either an 
Aruba Wi-Fi access point (AP), or for customers not using Aruba APs, via an Aruba AS-100 wireless sensor that 
bridges Bluetooth and Wi-Fi 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DESIGNING WITH MANAGEMENT IN MIND 
145
 Beyond Wi-Fi and Cellular 
 Beyond the use of Wi-Fi and the consumer’s cellular connection, there are other approaches  to   establish 
connectivity for monitoring. There is the prospect that beacons may eventually be configured via peer-to-peer 
networks, where changes are propagated from one beacon to another. 
 One beacon vendor, Sensoro has included a second radio built into each beacon so that its beacons 
can be configured over a proprietary long distance radio protocol. With this approach, one venue’s beacons 
could be managed by a single bridge node, rather than a larger number of Wi-Fi access points. 
 The work to perform these updates has the potential to impact the operational costs, service levels, and 
the ability to support new features. Therefore, it is one of the most important aspects to consider in a beacon 
management strategy. 
 Monitoring 
 Most beacon vendors offer a web-based fleet  monitoring dashboard, with a linear list of the beacons, 
displaying the key configuration parameters and health status, such as battery life. This may change going 
forward, as it may make more sense for the listings to become hierarchical around certain regions or location 
brands. If the network of beacons has tens of thousand of devices, a linear list would just be cumbersome to 
navigate. 
 When monitoring beacons, it’s possible that they may break or be removed, and so the status 
information reported could be out of date. The same issue may simply be caused because an app that is 
able to monitor the beacon hasn’t been in range of the beacon recently. Having monitoring done via a Wi-Fi 
bridge eliminates this ambiguity. 
 That being said, just showing the status of a beacon that is detected is a necessary element, but is 
not sufficient by itself. Exception reporting is important. In the case of a beacon that has disappeared, for 
instance, one of the exceptions that should be reported is that the system hasn’t received an update recently.   
 Figure 9-2.    Aruba’s Meridian cloud-management platform can manage beacons via Aruba access points or 
via the Aruba AS- 100 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DESIGNING WITH MANAGEMENT IN MIND 
146
 Fleet Management Standards 
 One of the issues the beacosystem faces is that, while it was born out of two standards, Bluetooth 4.0 and 
Apple’s de facto iBeacon standard, these  standards are incomplete. Incomplete in the sense that we can’t 
assemble a best-of-breed solution, where components can be swapped out and upgraded independently. 
 Networking equipment manufacturers have adopted SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) 
as a way of separating management tools from the systems being managed (such as hubs, switches, and 
routers). Currently, with Bluetooth beacons, when you select a beacon vendor you are also selecting the 
vendor of your fleet management system. This is good for beacon vendors who want to differentiate their 
hardware solution with the quality of their fleet management, but it does mean that if you aren’t happy with 
the antenna design of your beacon vendor, you will have to switch over to a new fleet management system in 
order to take advantage of another hardware platform. 
 Google’s Eddystone offers some room for optimism, as it introduced a standard for beacons to report 
their battery level and any changes in position using the Telemetry packet. Eddystone also includes the 
proximity API to register a beacon’s location and the metadata that describes it. Unfortunately, Apple 
is unlikely to adopt that standard, which now includes a standardized approach to updating beacon 
parameters. 
 The other ecosystem players vying to own the management space are the providers of orchestration 
software (described in a later chapter). These platforms that offer campaign and content management 
functions often include beacon monitoring, but they are precluded from offering a complete management 
solution because the interfaces to perform  configu ration changes and parameter updates are generally 
proprietary to the hardware manufacturer. 
 Fleet Management Products 
 Next, we will consider the fleet management offerings of three of the largest providers of beacons: Estimote, 
Sensoro, and Gimbal. This will give you a picture of how fleet management works in practice. You should get 
a sense of the similarities and differences in their approach, and can then apply these points of reference if 
you need to compare them with other vendors whose products you are interested in. 
 Estimote 
 As the beacon provider with probably the highest visibility of all the OEMs, Estimote is a good company to 
start with for our review of fleet management systems. 
 The design and user experience of their console and management app is in keeping with the high 
standard of industrial design of their beacons and their web site. The details of each beacon, including the 
address, broadcast interval, projected battery life, power, and firmware level are presented on the main 
 Beacon dashboard (see Figure  9-3 ). Where the firmware version needs to be upgraded, or the battery is low, 
it is highlighted in red.  

CHAPTER 9 ■ DESIGNING WITH MANAGEMENT IN MIND 
147
 Figure 9-3.  Estimote Cloud lists beacons with their  configurati on details 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DESIGNING WITH MANAGEMENT IN MIND 
148
 Beacons that are locked with conditional access, or “ Secure UUID ” as Estimote describes it, are flagged 
with a padlock. 
 The  settings of these parameters can be edited on an individual basis via this web interface 
(as shown in Figure  9-4 ).

 Data  for the dashboard is collected via the Estimote app, which lists the known beacons and shows the 
ones in range (see Figure  9-5 ). 
 Figure 9-5.  The beacon listing in the  Estim ote app 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DESIGNING WITH MANAGEMENT IN MIND 
150
 The app allows all of the parameters and metadata to be adjusted on site. These include the name, the 
dispatchable address of the beacon (geo location), and the indoor position, based on use of Estimote Indoor 
Location app. The fact that the beacon is owned by your organization is indicated by dotted lines connecting 
the beacon, the smartphone, and the Estimote Cloud icon (see Figure  9-6 ). The  screenshot on the right 
shows what happens if you inspect a beacon that you don’t own. The no-entry symbol indicates that access 
is denied, and none of the parameters is visible.

CHAPTER 9 ■ DESIGNING WITH MANAGEMENT IN MIND 
151
 In the Transmitted Packets section, the protocol/frame type that the beacon uses can be set to Estimote 
Default, Apple iBeacon, Eddystone-UID, or Eddystone-URL. The protocols offered are alternatives; you can’t 
interleave these frame types (see Figure  9-7 ). 
 Figure 9-7.  The beacon’s  Primary Packet Type can be set in the Broadcast Scheme 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DESIGNING WITH MANAGEMENT IN MIND

 Figure 9-8.  The different types of devices that can respond to the selected broadcast scheme are rendered as 
the frame type is  selected 
 When selecting the alternative packet types, an estimate of the battery life is shown for each broadcast 
standard, as well as an indication of which types of  devices   will be able to respond to the broadcasts 
(see Figure  9-8 ). 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DESIGNING WITH MANAGEMENT IN MIND 
153
 If you’re selecting Estimote or Apple iBeacon, the UUID and major and minor (UMM) numbers can be set. 
 If the beacon is configured with  Secure UUID , this initiates a random, slow roll of the UMM. The 
developer sees the “Real UUID,” which remains consistent, while those with apps that don’t have access to 
the beacon would see the “Visible UUID,” which changes periodically so that any mapping and reuse of the 
UMM will not be possible (see Figure  9-9 ).

154
 Figure 9-10.  With  Eddystone URL  selected, the data entry fields change 
 As you can see in Figure  9-10 , when  selecting  Eddystone-URL as the broadcast scheme, the entry field 
switches from the UMM fields to include a URL, which is broadcast instead.  
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DESIGNING WITH MANAGEMENT IN MIND 
155
 When any Eddystone primary packet type is selected, a secondary packet, the Eddystone telemetry 
packet, is enabled. The data that is collected from those packets is then presented in the app, for instance, 
“Packets Sent Since Reset”. 
 When  motion  UUID is set, the beacon will start to broadcast an alternative to the main UUID that 
indicates the beacon accelerometer is detecting movement. In Figure  9-11  you can see a still of what that 
screen looks like. In the actual app, there is animation to illustrate the movement of the motion UUID 
use-case. 
 Figure 9-11.    When  motion UUID   is selected, the beacon image on the right starts to wiggle and an alternate 
motion UUID can be set         
 If the beacon were attached to a shopping basket, for instance, this could be used to indicate it was 
in motion. 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DESIGNING WITH MANAGEMENT IN MIND 
156
 The broadcast power of a beacon can be set in the Estimote app with the slider at the bottom of the 
 Broadcast Power screen (Figure  9-12 ). As the power goes from low to high, the estimated lifetime of the 
battery is dynamically reduced, while the maximum range estimate and broadcast field graphic grows. 
Making these adjustments is fun and feels like a game, which typifies the approach to user experience design 
of the Estimote solution.  
 Figure 9-12.  Setting the broadcast power of the  be acon 
 The Broadcast Interval screen is designed in a similar way. When selecting a shorter broadcast interval, 
the beacon graphic pulsates faster and the battery life forecast is reduced dynamically. 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DESIGNING WITH MANAGEMENT IN MIND 
157
 Figure 9-13.  Beacon details include  firmware version and activation of accelerometer sensor 
 Selecting Beacon In Motion allows  sele ction of a feature that allows the beacon to be put to sleep, 
pausing broadcasts when it is flipped upside down (Figure  9-13 ). This can save battery, or be used for demos 
where you want to show events triggered by a newly sighted beacon.  
 The beacon details also include the firmware version. New  firmware images   can be downloaded and 
applied using the app (see Figure  9-14 ).

159
 Figure  9-15  captures the  setting change log , which tracks the application of the kind of changes we have 
been reviewing in this section. 
 It’s hard to imagine a more interactive and engaging management system for beacons than Estimote’s. 
True to its focus on pilot projects, the interface is a valuable asset in both selling the technology to 
stakeholders and learning about the technology. 
 Sensoro 
 Sensoro is an interesting player in the beacosystem. Their user experience design rivals that of Estimote, they 
have achieved a volume of beacon shipments for marquee customers that compares with that of Gimbal and, 
for deployments in China, they appear to be the undisputed leader. Their challenge is Anglicizing a product 
which has matured in Asia and bridging their go-to-market approach from China to the U.S. and European 
markets. The Sensoro fleet management system reflects all of these aspects of the company. It has clearly 
been used to deploy projects at large scale, with many features that earn Sensoro the right to claim the “fleet” 
in fleet management. However, there is still some work to be done to fully adapt it to Western markets.

CHAPTER 9 ■ DESIGNING WITH MANAGEMENT IN MIND 
160
 Figure 9-16.  The  Sensoro Cloud man agement console lists beacons by location 
 All that said, the main  dashboard screen in the Sensoro Cloud manager looks very familiar (see Figure  9-16 ), 
with the exception that it shows the output from the light sensors built into its Yunzi beacons. Cover up one of 
their beacons or turn out the lights, and you will see that status change. This light sensor may prove useful if you 
want to factor times when the lights are out in your energy saving schemes.  
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DESIGNING WITH MANAGEMENT IN MIND 
161
 One of the concepts unique to Sensoro is that of the role of a “ beacon inspector ,” which is a person who 
uses a purpose-built Sensoro Inspection app to “patrol” the beacons and relay their status back to the Sensoro 
Cloud. These  inspection  activities can be tracked from the management console shown in Figure  9-17 .  
 Figure 9-17.  The  Inspection Records screen tracks the patrols performed to gather status of the beacons 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DESIGNING WITH MANAGEMENT IN MIND 
162
 You won’t find this app on the Apple App Store, either. It’s an Enterprise app that is discovered via the 
Sensoro web site. Sensoro needs to be configured as a trusted developer using iOS in order to install the app 
on your phone. 
 Figure 9-18.    The main screen of the  Sensoro Inspection app         
 This app is simple and locked  do  wn (see Figure  9-18 ) so that someone with minimal training can be 
sent on patrols without the risk of configurations being interfered with.

 Sensoro Cloud stores  indoor  maps to track the location of beacons in a venue (see Figure  9-19 ). 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DESIGNING WITH MANAGEMENT IN MIND 
164
 The Sensoro app enables individual beacons to be configured through a process that starts with 
scanning the  barcodes  that are printed on their case (Figure  9-20 ). This selects the beacon and avoids any 
confusion as to which device is being set up. Without this kind of tool, it can be quite confusing when dealing 
with multiple beacons that all look the same. 
 Figure 9-20.    Scanning the barcodes on the Sensoro Yunzi and Pro beacons using the Sensoro app allows them 
to be individually  configured 
 All beacons that are in range can then be viewed in a Device List screen. The beacon status and 
configuration details can then be reviewed in the  Device Detail screen within the Sensoro app (Figure  9-21 ).

 On selecting the Setting button,  administrators  can use the screen shown in Figure  9-22  to configure the 
various kinds of advertising packets that Sensoro can broadcast.  
 Figure 9-22.    Once in  Settings mode , all of an individual beacon’s parameters can be changed and 
immediately saved 
 By selecting  Export Configuration to QRcode , as shown in Figure  9-22 , a selectable number of the 
settings can be saved in a template (shown in Figure  9-23 ). If the QR code is printed, it can be scanned again 
as part of a subsequent deployment process so that the same configuration parameters can be applied to 
the other beacons, one by one. This makes for a more reliable process for setting beacon parameters than 
manually adjusting each one in turn. 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DESIGNING WITH MANAGEMENT IN MIND 
167
 Unlike some beacons where you have to choose between broadcasting iBeacon or Eddystone frames, 
Sensoro beacons can interleave a large number of packet or  frame types  : iBeacon, Eddystone-UID, URL, 
TLM, the (proprietary) Sensoro packet (that relays the sensor settings), and AliBeacon. The last of these is a 
protocol specific to China and the Alibaba commerce site. 
 The  Deploy app offers another alternative to individually configuring beacons and is a distinctive 
feature of the Sensoro approach to fleet management. It enables changes to be made in more of a 
streamlined fashion. Multiple beacons that are in range can be selected, and a change to one or more 
attributes can be made in a batch process.

 Gimbal 
 The Gimbal dashboard provides access to a broad set of functions that extend beyond mere beacon 
functionality, including geofencing, push communications (Communicate) and analytics, as well as the 
 bea con-management facilities we are focusing on in this chapter. All these extras are a legacy of Gimbal’s 
origins as a context platform, before beacons were added to the system. The Beacon element of the 
dashboard (shown in Figure  9-25 ) was designed with management of large numbers of beacons in mind, 
with features for controlling access, sharing, and interfacing with a public network. 
 In Figure  9-24 , the Eddystone URL frame is being added to the configuration.   
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DESIGNING WITH MANAGEMENT IN MIND 
169
 The beacons listed on the Gimbal management screen are identified by Factory ID, which is the fixed 
identifier for each beacon recorded inside its case. As with the other dashboards, firmware levels, battery 
status, and metadata tags can be viewed on this screen. Battery status is reported to the Gimbal cloud by any 
app with the Gimbal SDK integrated, no matter whether the app is known to the developer. 
 Beacons can be set to Public (the default is Private) on a  settings screen . Private beacons may be viewed 
only by the developer’s apps, or specific apps where the beacon key is being shared. Public beacons are 
equivalent to a generic iBeacon, viewable by any developer.

CHAPTER 9 ■ DESIGNING WITH MANAGEMENT IN MIND 
170
 Figure 9-26.  The Beacon settings screen in the  Gimbal man agement console 
 As shown in Figure  9-26 , the beacon can be associated with  places   . A Gimbal place is a merging of their 
geofence construct with beacons. Historically, Gimbal geofences could be a polygon shaped area (versus round), 
formed by a collection of latitude/longitude coordinates calculated using GPS, Cell-ID, and Wi-Fi. Today, a place 
can be built from multiple beacons, a geofence, or a mixture of beacons and a geofence.   
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DESIGNING WITH MANAGEMENT IN MIND 
171
 Beacon configurations are templated in predefined configurations that have specific parameters preset, 
such as broadcast frequency, signal strength, and selection of directional or omnidirectional antenna 
(see Figure  9-27 ). These parameters are not selected on a beacon-by-beacon basis, or tweaked in the 
configuration app as the Estimote app allows. If you want to change these parameters, you need to create a 
new configuration template and associate the relevant beacons with that template using the dashboard. 
 Figure 9-27.  The  Configurations screen in the Gimbal management console 
 When you configure a beacon as an  iBeacon , each UMM setting requires its own template. This could 
result in a lot of templates needing to be created if the iBeacon frame type is used across a large network. 
Fortunately, the reality is that most Gimbal beacons are likely to use its native protocol, in which case this is 
not an issue. 
 For those experimenting with beacons, this may seem cumbersome, but this approach to enforcing 
uniformity is born out of organizing large deployments where consistency is key. 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DESIGNING WITH MANAGEMENT IN MIND 
172
 If a beacon is private, it can still be shared with a third-party developer’s app by creating a  sharing key 
(as depicted in Figure  9-28 ). This key can be associated with a subset of beacons. Access to the associated 
beacons is bound by a start and end time. 
 Figure 9-28.  The Sharing Keys setup screen in the  G imbal management console 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DESIGNING WITH MANAGEMENT IN MIND 
173
 Once a beacon has been associated with a configuration in the Gimbal management console, it can be 
initialized by the Gimbal configuration app (Figure  9-29 ). 
 Figure 9-29.  The Gimbal  configuration app scans looking for beacons to set up 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DESIGNING WITH MANAGEMENT IN MIND 
174
 When a beacon is reset by reseating the battery, (or pressing the reset button on the S21), the Gimbal 
app will detect if any  updates in firmware are available (Figure  9-30 ) or if configuration changes have been 
made in the management console and apply those over the air via a Bluetooth connection (Figure  9-31 ).

CHAPTER 9 ■ DESIGNING WITH MANAGEMENT IN MIND 
176
 The Gimbal  configuration app can then be used to inspect the status of beacons that are owned by the 
developer, showing the name, ID, signal strength, battery level, and temperature (Figure  9-32 ). 
 These readings are also relayed to the Gimbal cloud. From there, they can be displayed on the 
management console and accessed by  API . 
 Summary 
 After this chapter, you should have a good sense of how fleet management is performed by three of the 
largest beacon manufacturers. 
 There are similarities in their dashboards that track metadata and report status, but their approaches to 
configuring the hardware, managing those configurations across a fleet of beacons, monitoring the beacons 
status, and controlling the protocols broadcast are quite different. Estimote’s starting point is creating a 
magical experience for the developer and demonstrator of pilot projects. Sensoro’s collection of deployment 
apps and dashboards speaks to a focus on controlling large-scale deployments in an Asian context. Gimbal 
enforces a centralized approach to the discipline of fleet management and a vision for using beacons as part 
of a network of shared devices with a variety of other context serves included in the bundle. 
 Once we have decided how to deploy and manage beacons, our next task is to consider our approach to 
one of the biggest opportunities with these sensors: the insights from analytics.

 CHAPTER 10  
 Designing an Analytics 
Architecture to Leverage 
Proximity Data 
 By Ben Parker and Steve Statler 
 Analytics is an important aspect of any beacon solution. If  beacons are cookies that join the digital 
and physical worlds, then a key part of what analytics can bring is the ability to gain insights into what is 
happening in the physical domain.

 This chapter looks at some background to what’s happening in analytics, what big data is and its link 
with beacons, and how smartphones are changing this area. It then looks at the types of analytics software 
that can be applied to our solutions. We review some key providers of tools and then consider how beacon 
data can be structured so that we can best drill into those data sets. Lastly, we will consider a case study that 
illustrates what can be achieved with the data from beacons. 
 Big Data 
 Before  we  get into the beacon specifics, let’s take a moment to consider the magnitude of big data to help 
understand just how significant the analytics market is. 
 Prior to the advent of the Digital Age, the  Library of Congress was the U.S. benchmark for an attempt 
to inventory our collective knowledge. The Library’s collection has grown from 740 books and three maps 
shortly after being established in 1800 to its current collection of more than 61 million manuscripts and 32 
million books, as well as millions of prints, photographic images, sheet music, maps, and sound recordings. 
Facebook, just seven years after its founding, estimated in 2011 it had 3,000 times more data stored than 
the Library of Congress 1 . While no one would rationally compare the type of information being stored by 
Facebook to the Library of Congress’ collection, it is still an amazing example of the scale of today’s data 
collection activities. 
 This surge in information-gathering will only continue to escalate well beyond the 2.5 quintillion bytes 
of data already being collected every day 2 . Adding further fuel to this data collection fire is the emergence of 
the Internet of Things (IoT), with tens of millions of sensors now being embedded in cell phones, vehicles, 
industrial machines, smart meters, vending machines, retail stores, and public venues. One example of this 
proliferation is the average number of sensors in a car, which is expected to double over the next several 
years to over 200 per vehicle. 
 The amount of data being collected by leading U.S. companies—Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and 
Facebook—is simply staggering. In 2010, Facebook boasted that they had the world’s largest Hadoop cluster 
with 21 petabytes (PB; see Figure  10-1 to appreciate just how big that is) of storage. By mid-2012, their 
stored data had increased to 100PB and the company was processing 2.5 billion pieces of content and over 
500 terabytes of data each day. In early 2014, Facebook reached 600PB.

 Many companies are attempting to capitalize on this huge influx of data, and so are building enormous 
data-center infrastructures to store all of it. As a result, this type of analytics, often referred to simply as Big Data, 
has become a “must have” core competence of any organization planning to stay relevant in today’s business 
world. Additionally, the information gathered creates opportunities to disrupt the status quo in a market. 
 Web site click-stream data contributed to the need for Big Data tools and techniques. Now beacons are 
generating more sensor events that correlate to “foot-stream” data, further increasing the challenges and the 
opportunities. 
 Smartphones Changing Analytics 
 The prevalence of smartphones has created the ability for analytic platforms to combine online and offline 
data to offer new insights and a more comprehensive view of consumers. In one example, a retailer can now 
determine whether a customer, after viewing an online ad, went on to purchase the product online or visit 
the store to make the purchase.

CHAPTER 10 ■ DESIGNING AN ANALYTICS ARCHITECTURE TO LEVERAGE PROXIMITY DATA 
180
 The emergence of beacons further enhances this capability by collecting proximity data from locations 
that were previously problematic due to cell coverage issues. Using the retail example, the retailer can 
present a virtual coupon to the consumer while they are in the store to increase purchase intent. The retailer 
can then monitor, with the consumer’s consent, the time spent in the store, what departments they spent the 
most time in during the visit, and what types of offers drive the highest conversions. 
 With this in mind, let’s examine one of the key technology drivers that enable the development of 
sensors that can generate the data being crunched in analytics platforms. 
 MEMS Sensors 
 MEMS (Microelectromechanical  Systems ) is the underlying technology that enables sensors such as 
gyroscopes and accelerometers to be fabricated as a part of a silicon chip at very low cost. 
 The proliferation of MEMS sensors in smartphones, as illustrated in Figure  10-2 , enables smartphones 
to automatically adjust settings and functions based in a variety of contexts. For instance, they can brighten 
or dim based on available light, detect the proximity of another lost phone, and enhance mobile gaming 
with gyroscopic controls. Going forward, the newer sensors being added to phones will create a wave of 
innovative solutions, like understanding which floor in a store has the most foot traffic and real-time tracking 
of pollution levels in a city. With each new sensor added, Big Data is becoming bigger.

CHAPTER 10 ■ DESIGNING AN ANALYTICS ARCHITECTURE TO LEVERAGE PROXIMITY DATA 
181
 Beyond leveraging device sensors to create indoor maps, companies are also developing novel 
approaches to address indoor coverage opportunities. Examples of these companies, with select profiles to 
follow, include Indoo.rs, Navisens, SPREO, and Trusted Positioning. 
 Types of Analytics Software 
 There are a wide variety of analytics frameworks available, ranging from general-purpose analytics tools and 
statistics packages to specific location technologies designed to work with beacons. 
 For our purposes, as designers of proximity and location-aware solutions, we need to understand where 
to go in order to best source the functions needed to achieve our business goals. If we are to choose the 
right tool for the right job, it’s important to be able to classify the different types of analytics software that we 
might use to build our solutions (see Table  10-1 ).

 General-Purpose Analytics 
 The first principle, which seems self-evident, is that we shouldn’t waste time and money trying to reinvent 
the wheel, and we shouldn’t bet the success of our project on tools providers that are doing that either. 
Therefore, the first and largest category of tools we should get to know is “general-purpose analytics” tools. 
These include  Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) , data warehouse, and data mining tools. These tools, 
such as SAS, Teradata, and Business Objects make up a mature, multi-billion dollar market. Though many of 
the thousands of players in this space are not beacon-aware, they frequently have hooks for location in their 
frameworks that may be adapted to our purposes. The key point is we should try to avoid rewriting tools 
such as databases, visualization, and reporting, and instead leverage the existing products in this segment. 
 We have found that large players in this space, who may not have an emphasis on proximity, location, or 
beacons on their web sites, actually have customers who are starting to use these tools, which are installed 
throughout their enterprise in beacon projects. 
 It’s likely that engineers and developers in these companies will be experimenting with beacons and 
will welcome the opportunity to partner with a specialist technology provider or a customer who is an early 
adaptor. So the second key point is: look for opportunities to partner with the giants in this space. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ DESIGNING AN ANALYTICS ARCHITECTURE TO LEVERAGE PROXIMITY DATA 
182
 Vertical Market Analytics 
 For the same reasons that we need to be mindful of  the  general-purpose analytics tools providers, we need 
to be aware of the vertical analytics providers who have focused their offerings on a specific industry. These 
providers may already be building their offerings on top of the general-purpose tools providers. Retail is one 
of the key verticals where analytics is being applied and beacons add significant value. Aligning with and 
extending the capabilities of the existing players here is a good strategy, as we can build on the technical 
infrastructure they have, and on their customer relationships too. We may have some exciting beacon 
technology, but if it is to be absorbed into an end user’s environment, the best way to do that is to integrate 
with a solution they already have. These vertical partners also add value in being able to translate the 
language and needs of a given vertical into the language of our specialist area.  
 Ad Networks 
 Advertising   is a key horizontal application for beacons. While serving ads is a key part of what those 
networks do, the segmentation, targeting, and measurement components are just as important. We can look 
at the tools provided by the players in this space and imagine how proximity and location can be used. More 
on this in later chapters.  
 Specialist Beacon Analytics 
 At the opposite end of  the  specialization spectrum is the specialist’s tools, born to work specifically with 
beacons. These come in two forms, the more common of which are the dashboards and tools provided 
by the beacon vendors themselves. These can be tightly integrated into the sensors built into the beacon 
hardware. Less common are cross-platform tools developed for beacons. Examples of this are Lighthouse 
and Phunware. See Figure  10-3 for an example of a third-party beacon analytics dashboard. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ DESIGNING AN ANALYTICS ARCHITECTURE TO LEVERAGE PROXIMITY DATA 
183
 Location Analytics 
 Sitting as a midpoint between general-purpose and the specialist tools,  location analytics   were conceived 
with location in mind, but predate the advent of beacons. These tools may actually be best placed to 
capitalize on the beacon revolution, in that they are already established and mature, and well suited to 
benefit from what beacons bring. 
 The analytics market is rapidly evolving from simple, location-aware or proximity analytics (such as a 
heat map of foot traffic in a retail store) to behaviorally-aware or predictive analytics that will enable retailers 
to anticipate when you’ll return, what you’re likely to buy, and at what price point. 
 As illustrated in Figure  10-4 , we are in the early stages of phase 3.0, Behaviorally Aware, and this phase 
is being led by a new wave of interesting predictive analytics players, such as Opera Solutions, Fractal 
Analytics, and Revolution Analytics. The transition is supported by several key enablers, including the rapid 
proliferation of smartphones throughout the world, the emergence of wearables, and an increased number 
of device sensors and MEMS in devices.

 While numerous companies or organizations have already developed outdoor maps—including Digital 
Globe, Open Street Map, INTERMAP, Google, and Apple—the race is on to map indoor locations. Key 
players in the indoor location space include established companies like Google, but also several emerging 
companies such Indoor Atlas, Micello, and WiFiSLAM. Some of these companies are profiled in the next 
section, and each is taking a different approach to creating indoor maps. 
 Key Location Analytics Players 
 While there are hundreds of Big Data or analytics companies, there are a smaller number of emerging 
players focused primarily on location analytics. These include Factual, Placed, Euclid, PlaceIQ, 
PathIntelligence, Walkbase, Ninth Decimal, Nomi, AreaMetrics, and RetailNext. This section looks at a 
selection of these key players. 
 Google 
 Google  announced its Cartographer project in 2014, which uses a technology called “Simultaneous 
Localization and Mapping” (SLAM) in which a backpack-wearer generates floor plans, accurate within 
five centimeters, in real time as they walk through a building. The backpack includes a small computer 
connected to an Android tablet that enables the wearer to add points of interest along the way. 
 Indoor Atlas 
 Indoor Atlas , headquarted in Helsinki, offers a solution that utilizes compass sensors in smartphones 
to detect the unique magnetic signatures of buildings to create indoor maps. Indoor Atlas hopes to 
crowdsource its indoor maps by engaging a community of users similar to the way Waze has approached 
creating outdoor mapping.

CHAPTER 10 ■ DESIGNING AN ANALYTICS ARCHITECTURE TO LEVERAGE PROXIMITY DATA 
185
 Micello 
 Micello , founded in 2007, is an early pioneer in this market and now offers over 15,000 indoor venue maps in 
over 30 countries. Micello builds its indoor maps by using a team based in India to create a digital version of 
a map supplied by the venue. The digital version is then integrated into Google Maps. 
 WiFiSLAM 
 WiFiSLAM uses pattern recognition and machine learning to draw correlations between data gathered by 
device sensors (accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers) and then uses Wi-Fi trilateration to create 
accurate indoor maps. WiFiSLAM was acquired by Apple in 2013. 
 Navisens 
 Navisens uses its proprietary motionDNA™ technology to process data from inertial sensors (accelerometers 
and gyroscopes) to provide a 3D navigation solution without an underlying technology infrastructure 
such as Wi-Fi, GPS, or beacons. The technology was originally developed to locate firefighters and first-
responders. 
 SPREO 
 SPREO uses beacon and Wi-Fi signal fingerprinting, inertial sensor fusion, map constraints, and other data 
inputs to provide indoor location coverage, step-by-step indoor navigation, location-based marketing and 
analytics. Taubman Centers launched a shopping app, powered by SPREO, to provide indoor navigation and 
positioning in 18 malls in the United States. 
 Factual 
 Factual  was founded by Gil Ebaz who previously co-founded Applied Semantics. Applied Semantics was sold 
to Google for over $100 million in 2003. By Q1 2014, Applied Semantics’ main product AdSense comprised 
$3.4 billion or 22% of Google’s total revenue. So Gil has a track record of developing valuable companies. It’s 
significant that he has focused on a building company that collects metadata for maps. 
 Factual has now built a data set of over 75 million local businesses and points of interest in 50 countries 
and analyzes billions of data points every day. For example, their Global Places service provides the name, 
address, phone number, web site, latitude, longitude, and hours of operation of the places in their database. 
Customers—including Yelp, Foursquare, Bing, The Weather Channel, and Groupon—are both suppliers and 
users of Factual’s data. 
 PlaceIQ 
  PlaceIQ , founded in 2010, sources data on the location, movements, and behavior of over 100 million 
people from third-party apps that it integrates with. The company’s platform layers this data over a map 
of the physical world via tiles. It uses nearly one billion of these tiles, each measuring 100 by 100 meters, 
to create an understanding of each space, including the types of locations, types, and number people and 
their behaviors. They can use this data to target certain types of people based on their movements, look 
at the behavior of people before and after a mobile or TV ad campaign, and then look at their visits to 
certain locations, such as a particular brand of car dealership, in order to measure the effectiveness of the 
campaign.  

CHAPTER 10 ■ DESIGNING AN ANALYTICS ARCHITECTURE TO LEVERAGE PROXIMITY DATA 
186
 Ninth Decimal 
 Ninth Decimal  , previously known as JiWire, was launched in 2006 to help businesses monetize Wi-Fi access 
by serving ads to users when they connected. In 2012 they pivoted, focusing on the audience targeting 
capability that they had developed to sell ads on their Wi-Fi network, but extending it to a broader mobile 
phone network enabled by mobile app publishers. By understanding the venues that people frequent with 
their phones, they can target based on profiles such as:
• 
 Business traveler who regularly travels away from home 
• 
 Pet owner who goes to pet shops regularly 
• 
 Healthy living folks who go to gyms a lot 
• 
 Auto intenders who are visiting car dealerships    
 Having targeted an audience for a mobile advertising campaign, their LCI TM attribution analytics can 
measure “lift,” which is the effectiveness of an advertising campaign at driving visits to a physical store, by 
comparing the behavior of a control group of consumers that don’t receive the ads. Conversions can be 
reported against asset of dimensions such as:
• 
 Cost per incremental visit 
• 
 Profile of visitors (see the previous examples, plus demographics such as age and 
income)  
• 
 Region/state/city 
• 
 Visitor’s proximity to store when they received the ad 
• 
 Average time to first visit 
• 
 When the visits took place (day/time of day) 
• 
 Locations visited prior to the store visit (competitors)     
 RetailNext 
 RetailNext , founded in 2007, has emerged as a leading provider of in-store analytics for retailers, shopping 
centers, and manufacturers. They use a variety of data sources—including video cameras, Wi-Fi and 
Bluetooth devices, guest Wi-Fi, POS systems, promotional calendars, payment cards, and weather reports—
to provide in-store analytics. 
 RetailNext tracks more than one billion shoppers per year by collecting data from more than 65,000 
sensors in retail stores and analyzing trillions of data points annually. 
 They use Bluetooth beacons in conjunction with their heatmap product that uses the output from 
security cameras to track the areas of the store that are most frequently visited. Staff members carry beacons 
so that their presence can be factored out of the heatmaps. RetailNext places hubs at points that allow the 
location of the beacons to be calculated using trilateration. 
 Their customers include retailers such as Bloomingdale’s, American Apparel, Brookstone, and Verizon 
Wireless, and manufacturers such as PepsiCo and P&G.

 A Dimensional Data Model for Beacon Analytics 
 
DIMENSIONAL DATA MODELING
 
 Up until the late 1980s, most data warehouse schemas were based on complex entity-relationship 
diagrams that made querying these huge repositories a job only a programmer could perform. By the 
end of that decade, this bottleneck around the central warehouse had inspired a change in best practice 
that begat the data mart, which is a subset of the enterprise’s warehouse data, designed for more 
rapid access to quickly answer specific needs. One of the strategies for accomplishing this was called 
 dimensional data modeling , which is a technique that gained broad adoption as a way of structuring 
those data marts so that queries could be written simply and rapidly. A whole industry of  On-Line 
Analytical Processing (OLAP) tools coalesced to enable business teams to query the data mart using this 
dimensional design. 
 A dimensional data model consists of a central table of facts or numbers that are “sliced and diced” 
along dimensions that help us to aggregate the facts in meaningful ways. Examples of facts might be 
sales data records, which can be summarized by dimensions such as time, region, and product. The 
schemas were represented as “star schemas” with dimension tables surrounding the fact table in the 
middle. When an OLAP tool was used to report on the star schema, it resembled a spreadsheet, where 
the dimensions were the column and row headings, and the facts were the numbers in the middle. 
Excel supports this model with pivot tables. 
 This way of organizing data allows business and IT users to quickly design systems that are efficient 
and informative. 
 In order to help explore the kinds of queries that a beacon-enabled analytics system can allow, we will 
construct a simple dimensional data model that represents the kinds of  facts that beacons can collect and 
the  dimensions that can be used to “slice and dice” that data. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ DESIGNING AN ANALYTICS ARCHITECTURE TO LEVERAGE PROXIMITY DATA 
188
 Figure  10-5  shows an example. The facts in our dimensional data model relate to a campaign flow for a 
restaurant app that is beacon-enabled. The flow of the campaign starts within the app, with a count of app 
registrations, the number of those users who then go on to use the app, the number of messages sent to the 
user (messages that could be triggered by or filtered by location or proximity figures, like the presence of a 
user near a restaurant), the number of those messages that were clicked on, and the rate at which people 
opened the app. 
 Figure 10-5.  A dimensional data model for analyzing beacon events 
 We then count the visits to the property, which the app will detect, on seeing a beacon. Dwell time 
within the restaurant is calculated using entry and exit events from a beacon and conversion could be 
measured by the duration of the dwell time in the eating area of the restaurant. 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ DESIGNING AN ANALYTICS ARCHITECTURE TO LEVERAGE PROXIMITY DATA 
189
 These facts could be used to populate a funnel such as the one in Figure  10-6 showing the conversion 
from one stage to the next. 
 Figure 10-6.     Example of a campaign conversion funnel based on the dimensional model  
 The “drill down” (as analysts call it) into those numbers can be done using any of the dimensions. The 
time dimension is, by its nature, hierarchical. You can look at the conversion from messages to visits over the 
year, by month week and day, and then by comparing time periods. For instance, is our conversion rate up 
this week versus last week? 
 We may have a variety of attributes to describe our customers that can be used to drill down into 
conversion rate. At the most basic level, we can compare conversion rate of first-time users of the app to 
regular users of the app. If the conversion rate of our regular users suddenly goes down, maybe it’s time to 
check the menu to see if a favorite item has changed. 
 We can then use the place dimension to drill down into those numbers further, by comparing 
conversion rate down a hierarchy of places. At the top we look at the conversion rate by country, then by 
state, region, town, and then a particular restaurant. In this way we can see outliers, such as the conversion 
rate was up in California and was down in Oregon this week. Other attributes in the place dimension might 
be the type of restaurant; maybe different kinds of format or size of restaurants in a given chain. We may 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ DESIGNING AN ANALYTICS ARCHITECTURE TO LEVERAGE PROXIMITY DATA 
190
tag the restaurants by the affinity of a type of person to the restaurant. If we have demographic data on the 
visitors, we may be able to tag the locations with those demographics so that we can look at the performance 
of restaurants that have a customer base that is higher or lower income. 
 So our simple star schema becomes a powerful way of exploring a range of questions. Our fact table is 
enriched by the beacon data because we can look at the behavior of our guests in the restaurant. 
 Let us now refine our restaurant business analysis and focus on dwell time in different zones of the 
restaurant. We will do that by presenting our facts and dimensions in the form of a table presented in 
Figure  10-7 . Here our dimensions are the time of day along the top and the zones in the restaurant on the 
side. By slicing the dwell time of guests in the reception area waiting for the maître d’ to seat them, we can 
see that our early birds have to wait 10 minutes as the staff gets ready, and wait times remain short up until 
noon, when the lunch time rush causes a significant backlog. 
 High dwell times in the bar are a good thing, since the longer customers stay, the more drinks they buy, 
but dwell time in the restaurant section is a concern. Here we are interested in maximizing “table turns” in 
order to get a better yield from the fixed number of tables we have available. It looks like at noon our dwell 
time is over an hour, a lot higher than any other time of day. Maybe this is what’s driving up the dwell time in 
reception. This is likely to be a staffing problem of some kind. 
 Without beacons, all we would be able to see is the number of receipts. We wouldn’t get a clear sense 
of whether low numbers are due to not enough customers or, as in this case, problems with servicing the 
customers we have waiting. 
 Your data model will, of course, differ. Perhaps you will add a product dimension so you can slice and 
dice the campaign based on the products being promoted and purchased. The details of the hierarchies 
for place and customer will change from company to company. Your facts even may relate to a completely 
different proximity application. If, for instance, you are measuring the time spent by patients waiting in a 
waiting room rather than customers in the bar, the goal will be to drive dwell times down rather than up. 
 The star schema provides a common way for business people and the IT staff to think about the 
information that can be collected and the kinds of questions that can be explored. Beacons don’t change 
the techniques for organizing the data, but they increase the volume of the data and open up new sets 
of questions and answers to explore. They also make designing the way analytics are done even more 
important than it was before. 
 Case Study: AreaMetrics 
 AreaMetrics,   originally known as Happy Hour Hawaii, was founded in 2011 by Carey and Brandon Bennett 
in Honolulu, Hawaii after a fortuitous decision by Carey to write a weekly Happy Hours column. 
 “We only knew of a few happy hours on the island, and we were becoming quite bored with our options. 
We looked for resources that would tell us the details of other happy hours in the area, but nothing existed. So, 
we created a web site and mobile apps for people just like us. It turns out, there were thousands of people who 
wanted access to detailed happy hour information so they could save money while dining out,” said Carey. 
 Figure 10-7.     Dimensional data presented in table format        
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ DESIGNING AN ANALYTICS ARCHITECTURE TO LEVERAGE PROXIMITY DATA 
191
 Carey contacted a local periodical, the Star Advertiser, to write about interesting Happy Hour spots and 
was hired to write a weekly column. While writing the column, Carey and Brandon came up with the idea to 
develop an app to enable users to find nearby happy hour specials and provide restaurant owners with an 
opportunity to engage directly with customers. 
 Brandon developed the app in seven months despite having no prior programming experience. The 
solution offered to the restaurants included the app as well as beacons placed in each venue. 
 “YouTube was one of my best friends for several months. I’d spend about 12 hours a day watching 
tutorials on how to program in PHP. Eventually, I built up the skillset needed to create the web site. The 
site grew in popularity, and we quickly realized that we’d need apps for both iOS and Android. So, back to 
YouTube I went," explained Brandon in describing how he used YouTube to develop his programming skills. 
 After gaining some initial market traction, but needing additional capital to grow, the company applied 
and was selected to be part of the Blue Startups accelerator. The accelerator was launched by Henk Rogers, 
founder of Blue Planet Software (sole agent of Tetris). 
 Beacons 
 Carey and Brandon decided to use Estimote  beacons  due to an advisory member’s introduction to the 
company’s CEO. The Estimote beacons, with their unusual industrial design, were a key differentiator for 
the app, particularly when pitching to restaurant owners and managers. The beacon design is unique in the 
industry as they look like small rocks and are available in a variety of pastel colors, including blue, purple, 
and green. 
 The colorful appearance of the beacons, however, brought with it an issue. Children were drawn to 
them, so it quickly became apparent the beacons had to be placed high up, above the door, out of the reach 
of prying hands. 
 The beacons enabled venue owners to determine how many customers the app had driven into their 
happy hour. If a customer viewed the details of a restaurant in the app and then visited the same restaurant 
within 12 hours, the company could claim credit for that visit. The app would sight the beacon and, after 
about 30 seconds of being in range of the beacon, a visit could be verified.  
 Market Launch 
 The app was launched in Hawaii and immediately experienced rapid growth, reaching 50,000 downloads 
in the first six months. Based on this initial success, the company decided to expand beyond Hawaii and 
rebranded the app from Happy Hour Hawaii to Happy Hour Pal. They completed a  market   trial in the 
Hamptons during the summer and then launched in Portland, Oregon. Portland was chosen based on 
research that it has the highest per capita number of happy hours in the United States. The service was 
initially marketed door-to-door to restaurants and monetized via a monthly recurring fee.  
 Company Evolution 
 While the  app  experienced rapid growth in downloads, the restaurant owners wanted to use the service to 
gain greater insight into their own businesses, hoping to answer questions such as:
• 
 How long are customers staying at the restaurant? 
• 
 What are the age and gender of my customers?  
• 
 How often do my customers return? 
• 
 Which customers are visiting my other restaurants?  

CHAPTER 10 ■ DESIGNING AN ANALYTICS ARCHITECTURE TO LEVERAGE PROXIMITY DATA 
192
• 
 What is the “bounce” rate? (i.e., how many users walk by without entering? How 
many arrive and then leave right away?) 
• 
 What neighborhoods are my customers coming from?    
 To get restaurant owners to sign up for the app, the Bennetts found that emphasizing the analytics 
capabilities available to the restaurant owners was the key to closing deals. Soon, the pitch evolved to 
focus on the insights driven by the analytics before even mentioning the app. Based on this experience, 
as well as the challenge of competing in a crowded app market, the company decided to evolve from its 
proximity marketing services via its app to offering an analytics platform, the dashboard for which is shown 
in Figure  10-8 . As part of this transition, the company also rebranded from Happy Hour Pal to AreaMetrics. 
They expanded beyond their core Happy Hour Pal users to secure strategic partnerships with leading 
location-enabled app players focused on the food and beverage, travel, and dating markets.  
 AreaMetrics Go-To-Market Strategy has evolved from direct door-to-door sales to an indirect strategy of 
partnering with companies that already service the restaurant and hospitality market. 
 Technology and Architecture 
 AreaMetrics is built in Ruby using  the  Rails framework.  The   database is Postgres, and the company uses an 
API to manage and access all data. The  Software Development Kit (SDK)   that interacts with their Bluetooth 
beacons is written in Objective C. 
 The platform leverages a network of millions of app users to gather its key analytics such as customer 
demographics, walk by conversions, visit duration, and bounce rates.  
 Business Results 
 AreaMetrics,  via its partnerships with leading app companies, reached 15 million users in July 2015 and 
is adding 50,000 users per day. The company has thousands of beacons installed in restaurants and is 
expanding into other markets including retail, travel, financial services, sports venues, and gaming with 
plans for a full-scale national launch by mid-to-late 2016. AreaMetrics continues to charge a recurring 
monthly fee for access to its analytics platform.

CHAPTER 10 ■ DESIGNING AN ANALYTICS ARCHITECTURE TO LEVERAGE PROXIMITY DATA 
193
 Lessons Learned 
 AreaMetrics success to date is attributed to the team’s ability to recognize the evolving needs in their market 
and then quickly respond to capitalize on the opportunity. 
 The company used a  “dominate a niche” strategy by building tens of thousands of active users and 
installing thousands of beacons in the hospitality market before extending into other markets. 
 The use of beacons allowed them to differentiate their service to merchants, unlocking the real value 
of their offering, which was the analytics capabilities. Beacons acted as cookies in the physical world to link 
customers and venues in order to establish “attribution,” and then to derive a dwell time that will provide 
additional understanding of the behavior of the visitors they had driven to the venue. 
 Their free app enabled the business to bootstrap the offering, building a base of users. They established 
the value in the offering was the analytics, which could be sold to the venue owners. 
 Beacons need apps. App adoption can be a major constraint. Carey and Brandon understood that their 
market penetration was limited by the adoption of their app, and they were able to parlay the value of their 
analytics sub-system to engage other app owners and scale using their success in adjacent markets. 
 Implications 
 As the astronomer and author Cliff Stoll stated, “Data is not information, information is not knowledge, 
knowledge is not understanding, understanding is not wisdom.” 
 While we are now the beneficiaries of endless streams of data, companies are scrambling to make sense 
of it all in order to convert data into actionable insights. Companies must also navigate a delicate balance of 
the desire for additional data on consumer behavior against the privacy concerns of those same consumers. 
One of the companies mentioned earlier, Euclid, had two well-publicized incidents due to consumer 
backlash toward its tracking of shoppers. In 2013, Nordstrom cancelled an 8-month, 17-store pilot of Euclid’s 
technology after the public found out about the pilots from news outlets. The following year, Philz Coffee in 
San Francisco also stopped using Euclid after the  San Francisco Appeal  ran an article about the coffee shop 
tracking its customers. 
 As a result of these concerns, leading analytics companies agreed to a self-policed  Mobile Location 
Analytics Code of Conduct that allows consumers to opt out of tracking done through smartphones at retail 
locations. The Code of Conduct was drawn up through collaboration with U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer and 
the Future of Privacy Forum. 
 Yet despite these privacy concerns,  location-centric analytics are already driving tangible consumer 
benefits. Examples include fans finding the shortest concession line at a sports stadium, shoppers being 
sent personalized coupons or discounts at the point of purchase, and finding your way through a hospital or 
airport. As additional sensors are added to smartphones and wearables see further adoption, other benefits 
may come to include environmental agencies understanding real-time pollution conditions in various cities, 
or consumers saving on medical insurance costs by opting in to provide their health and fitness information. 
Euclid now has a healthy business with large numbers of retailers using their services again.  
 Summary 
 Analytic platforms that develop insights from existing and emerging location technologies have the potential 
to transform the way organizations interact with their customers, employees, supply chain partners, and 
other key stakeholders. Sustainable success, however, will be created by the organizations that balance 
innovation with privacy concerns. 
 The next chapter looks at privacy from the perspective a lawyer who has focused on this subject and 
applied that knowledge specifically to the deployment of beacons.

 CHAPTER 11  
 Designing with Privacy in Mind 
 Jarno Vanto, Partner, Borenius Attorneys, LLP 
 It is clear that  beacon technology fundamentally changes the way retailers and advertisers communicate 
with customers. However, what is also clear is that the location-based  technologies   have attracted very 
polarized attention from the media. For example, in the fall of 2014 beacons were placed in NYC phone 
booths for testing purposes. City Hall ordered the beacons to be removed within hours as some were

concerned that the beacons would track the movement of users. 1 The fact that beacons can be used to 
collect consumer geolocation data has arguably turned out to be the greatest concern of many consumer 
groups. A recent Pew study found that location data has become even more precious and valued by 
consumers in the smartphone era. On the one hand, even though the majority of consumers will share their 
personal information in exchange for something of value, many feel unhappy about what happens to the 
information collected about them, especially if the data collected is used for other purposes than what they 
were originally collected for. 2 On the other hand, even though consumers claim to deeply care about privacy, 
studies show that consumers are in most cases ready to give up some privacy if they perceive that they are 
receiving some benefit in return, for example in the form of discounts or loyalty programs. 3 
 The constantly evolving technology and consumer privacy scares have forced lawmakers and regulators 
around the globe to consider how, and if, the collection of geolocation information should be regulated. 
Given that legal instruments often lag behind technological developments, often outdated laws and 
regulations are applied to facts that they were not designed for in the first place. This can lead to mediocre 
results at best. 
 The Current Legal Landscape 
 Beacons have not yet been  under  much regulatory scrutiny, but this is likely to change in the near future. 
The main legal question thus far has involved the issue of choice or consent—people should have the 
right to choose whether information about them can be collected, and whether it can be shared with third 
parties. In essence, this is a right to control one’s own information or informational self-determination. 
Are organizations using beacon technology thus required to obtain consent from the consumer? Or 
more fundamentally, should consent even be the way to solve the privacy questions surrounding beacon 
technology? 
 Although it often seems that technology erases the meaning of state lines, turning us into one big 
international community, laws continue to be inherently local. This forces organizations to be able 
to navigate a challenging jurisdictional jungle. Arguably two of the most globally influential privacy 
jurisdictions are the United States (US) and the European Union (EU). As we shall see, even though these 
two jurisdictions view privacy quite differently, their views on consent are not all that different. 
 The Legal Framework in the United States 
 Perhaps contrary  to  popular belief, the United States regulates privacy quite extensively. However, instead 
of comprehensive privacy laws governing all personal data processing such as in the EU, the United States 
has multiple sectoral laws and regulations that govern different commercial communication situations. This 
privacy scheme has rightly often been referred to as a “patchwork quilt.” 4 
 A number of parties are instrumental in shaping the U.S. legal framework in the privacy field. These 
parties include groups dedicated to promoting privacy and the regulation of privacy, private litigants who 
have sued companies for violations of privacy laws, the Congress, and the  Federal Trade Commission (FTC)  , 
which focuses on encouraging a self-regulatory framework and promotes notice, choice, and transparency, 
as well as the advertising industry. 5 The FTC has become especially active since 2010, and it has put great

effort into promoting privacy, greater transparency, and consumer control over information gathering. 
The U.S. Department of Commerce also issued a green paper in 2010 about data privacy in which it, inter 
alia 6 , promoted the significance of consent. 7 At the state level, California has definitely been the most active 
in regulating privacy. 
 The legislative branches, both at the federal and state levels, have been persistent in their efforts to 
protect privacy. During the past few years, multiple bills have been proposed in Congress, albeit without 
much success, with the intent to protect individuals’ geolocation information. For example, the  Commercial 
Privacy Bill of Rights Act of 2011 would have required an affirmative opt-in consent for the collection of 
sensitive information. 8 The  Geolocation Privacy and Surveillance Act (GPS Act) would have set forth a clear 
legal framework for the usage of, and access to, geolocation information. The bill was introduced in the 
Senate and in the House in March 2013. Most recently, the Location Privacy Protection  Act   of 2015 (LPPA) 
was reintroduced by Minnesota Senator Al Franken. The LPPA would have prohibited companies from 
collecting or disclosing individuals’ geolocation information from electronic devices without the user’s 
affirmative express consent. 9 State legislatures have also considered regulating geolocation information, 
however, more so with regards to law enforcement access. 10 
 Thus, federal law in itself does not currently require businesses to obtain consent for the collection of 
geolocation data, or to disclose whether or not they collect geolocation data. They are only prohibited from 
misrepresenting their data collection practices. However, note that if  the   Location Privacy Protection Act of 
2015 were to pass, consent would be required before the collection of geolocation data. 
 The  FTC has played a major role in enforcing consumer privacy, also on the issue of geolocation 
privacy. Even though location-based advertising is not currently subject to any specific federal regulations, 
FTC guidelines and industry standards do require that location information not be collected or used 
without consumer consent. The FTC has been involved in multiple cases where the collection of geolocation 
information was an issue. For instance, FTC v. Goldenshores Technologies was the first case in which the 
collection and sharing of geolocation data was the primary focus of the FTC. Here, a flashlight app collected 
its users’ location information without disclosing it in its privacy policy. This decision is also quite unique 
in how it contains detailed instructions regarding the collection of geolocation information. The settlement 
agreement required, inter alia, the application to obtain an affirmative express consent from users before 
collecting such data. 11 FTC formally characterized geolocation information as “sensitive” in its privacy report 
from March 2012, in which it also strongly encouraged organizations to acquire consent before the collection 
or sharing of such data. 12 Moreover, in February 2015, the FTC published guidelines that further expand its 
advice with regards to the collection of user location data. 13

 A couple of months later,  the  FTC had its first case against a retail tracking company, which eventually 
led to a settlement. 14 The FTC claimed that Nomi Technologies’ privacy statement was inconsistent with 
the company’s actual practices. Nomi provides technology that allows its clients to track customers by, for 
example, providing data on how much time customers spend in different sections of the store, and so on. 
Nomi’s privacy policy provided that consumers have the possibility of opting out of the retail tracking. Even 
though Nomi’s web site offered a possibility to opt-out, all of its clients’ retail locations did not. In addition, 
Nomi did not require its clients to provide notice to their customers. FTC indicated that these factors 
rendered Nomi’s privacy policy deceptive. Even though the case focused on the company’s deceptive privacy 
statement, it can also be viewed as the FTC’s first step in implementing the online world’s notice-and-choice 
regime to retail tracking. 
 Even though the order did not per se impose an affirmative requirement, it does look like the FTC is 
moving to the direction of imposing an affirmative requirement for companies to disclose their tracking 
practices and acquire consumers’ consent. In the light of Nomi, it is particularly important that all the 
participants in the beacon data value chain—including advertising networks, data aggregators, beacon 
service providers, retailers, and brands—must ensure contractually that proper notices are provided to 
customers and that each participant in the value chain uphold its privacy obligations.   
 The Legal Framework in the EU 
 Europe is the home of some of the oldest, most comprehensive, ambitious, and bureaucratic data privacy 
laws. The Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (“E-Privacy Directive”) 15  forms a part of 
this comprehensive regulatory framework. The  E-Privacy Directive   deals specifically with data protection/
privacy in the sector of electronic communications networks and services. Article 9 of the E-Privacy 
Directive sets forth that organizations may process location data only if it has been made anonymous, 
or with the consent of users and only for the duration necessary. 16  Given that EU directives have to be 
implemented into EU Member State law, the Member States have some leeway in implementing them 
into national law. For example, Finland has implemented the E-Privacy Directive into national law by 
enacting the Information Society Code. 17 Chapter   20 , Section 160 of this code implements the respective 
“requirement for consent” provision of the directive, in addition to which it provides that location data can 
only be processed to the extent required for the purpose of the processing and in such a manner that does 
not unnecessarily invade a user’s privacy. Moreover, following the processing of location data, the location 
data must be deleted or anonymized. 
 The Problem with Consent 
 Typically, most beacons themselves do not actually collect data as such. Rather, beacons transmit a signal 
to an application or a URL that is broadcasted directly to the mobile device of the individual. It is the 
application between the beacon and the device that receives the data.  Beacon signals   are not received unless 
a consumer has installed an application that is connected with the beacons in question. By themselves, 
beacons only detect the entering of a Bluetooth-enabled device into a particular zone or a “geofence.” From 
this point of view, the individual is in charge of interacting with the beacon.

CHAPTER 11 ■ DESIGNING WITH PRIVACY IN MIND

 However, the individual’s control over the choice of interacting with the beacon can seem a little blurry. 
Beacons are often designed to be discreet and retail stores often decide to hide them, which makes it nearly 
impossible for consumers to notice them. When beacons are hidden, and the consumers do not know of 
their existence in a particular location, are consumers really in charge of interacting with the beacon? As 
we later suggest, instead of hiding the beacons and “tricking” consumers to provide their data, it is worth 
considering placing beacons in a visible location. 
 With respect to consent, placing consent language in long and convoluted privacy policies and terms 
of use does not provide customers with a meaningful notice or choice. Many consumers agree to terms and 
conditions as well as privacy policies without reading them. One study showed that it would take on an 
average 244 hours per year to read and skim privacy policies. 18 Most users are likely to miss the fine print that 
states that they agree to the collection of their geolocation data and allow it to be passed to third parties. As 
the comedian John Oliver has stated, you could put the entire text of  Mein Kampf  in the midst of the terms 
of service and users would still probably click “Agree.” Even though, from a purely legal perspective, these 
consents most often are valid, best practices in the field suggest a different approach. 
 Suggestions for Best Practice 
 As discussed previously, the current laws and regulations are often unable to keep up with the rapid 
technological development. Therefore, governments often have encouraged “policing oneself” instead of 
relying solely on the current legal rules. For example, the FTC and the White House have published reports in 
which they promote the need for industry codes of conduct and processes that include multiple stakeholders. 
The Asia-Pacific region has also built a privacy framework around the concept of co-regulation. 
 For example, the Network Advertising Initiative has some of the strongest standards for self-regulation 
in the United States. Their Code of Conduct (updated in 2015) was strongly influenced by FTC’s Staff 
Report on Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. 19  The Future of Privacy Forum has 
also provided a self-regulatory framework, “ Mobile Location Analytics Code of Conduct .” 20 Another useful 
guide is the American Institute of CPAs’  Generally Accepted Privacy Principles (GAPP)  , which provides 
a framework intended to assist in creating an effective privacy program that helps prevent and manage 
privacy risks. 21  Most recently in February 2016, the ACLU of Southern California issued a privacy guide for 
technology companies. 22 
 We have identified some of the most important principles that together form the best practices for 
privacy and beacon technology. These principles include notice, choice, limited collection, transparency 
and consumer education, disclosure to third parties, and security. 
 Notice 
 Notice is one of the most fundamental privacy principles. It should be clearly linked with choice. Consumers 
cannot make a meaningful choice about their data collection if they have not been given notice, or if the notice 
has been hidden in the privacy policy or terms of use only. Moreover, since beacons are often camouflaged to 
match their surroundings, consumers need to be able to know that beacons exist in the store. As an alternative

200
to camouflaging beacons, for example, GameStop has embraced a strategy that puts beacons in the spotlight 
and encourages customers to engage with them. 23 A more discreet way to provide notice would be to place a 
sign inside the beacon zone or provide a push notification to the device in question. 
 In addition to getting notice that beacons exist and are used in the store, consumers should also be provided 
a clear notice of what information is collected from their mobile device. It is also important that the user be 
notified of whether the application continues to collect information despite being closed by the user. Many users 
do not necessarily understand this collection practice, which makes disclosure even more important.  
 Choice 
 Companies using beacon technology should provide consumers with the  choice of whether they want data 
about them collected. FTC’s settlement with the mobile location tracking company Nomi Technologies 
demonstrates that companies using cutting-edge technology need to be clear about what choices they 
provide to their users. 
 Users want to control how information about them is used or shared. Companies have the possibility 
of providing either an “opt-out” or “opt-in” mechanism for consumer choice. Opt-out by default tracks 
consumers but gives them the possibility to opt out from tracking, for example on the company web site. 
Following Nomi, consumers should also be made aware of their choice in retail stores. The consumer has 
to take an active role in removing him or herself from participation of the tracking or data sharing. The 
strongest argument against opt-out is that consumers are not always aware that their behavior is being 
tracked, and opting out may be a cumbersome exercise in itself. 
 Opt-in is a way to give consumers more control over how information about them is being collected as it 
provides them with the ability to actively choose to participate in mobile location analytics. Opt-in also tends 
to be more transparent than opt-out. Generally best practice favors opt-in over opt-out as opt-in provides 
consumers with a truly meaningful choice. 
 Disclosure to Third Parties 
 Many users are especially concerned about whether data about them is being shared with third  parties  . 
Therefore, the notice requirement should also include information about the company’s data-sharing 
practices. The notice should explain whether information is shared in individual or aggregate form, who can 
access the information about them, and for what purposes.  
 Limited Collection 
 Collecting more information than the purpose requires may lead consumers to mistrust the company, and 
this can sometimes even violate the company’s own privacy policy and/or terms of use. A good way to avoid 
these problems is to collect and retain only as much data as is needed. However, if a mobile application 
developer wants to collect more information than the purpose allows, the developer should obtain clear 
consent from the consumers. 
 Transparency and Consumer Education 
 Even though businesses invest great effort in developing applications for beacon data collection, many 
businesses do not inform customers about them. The more  consumers   learn about how beacon technology 
works and understand that they themselves are in control, the more likely it is that consumers will find the 
 23 www.geomarketing.com/display-beacons-dont-hide-them-says-gamestop 

CHAPTER 11 ■ DESIGNING WITH PRIVACY IN MIND
201
benefits persuasive enough to opt-in to beacon-enabled applications. Multiple industry codes of conduct 
have put transparency in the center of their framework. Companies should be as transparent as possible 
about their data collection practices. For the benefit of both consumers and the market, it is important that 
consumers have a clear understanding of the operation of beacons and the applications that utilize beacons. 
Consumers should understand how their data is being collected and used.  Transparency can also build 
loyalty and trust among users. 
 Security 
 Companies should protect the data they collect with strict  security   practices. The FTC requires companies to 
secure their user data, and it has the authority to, among other things, impose fines if it finds the company’s 
security practices to be too lax. All methods of data collection and storage should be properly secured, and data 
encryption should be used when potentially sensitive information is involved. “Privacy by design” is a concept 
that suggests that instead of securing privacy by following regulations, privacy should become the default 
mode of operation. This means that applications and other products are designed with privacy in mind.   
 Summary: What the Future Will Look Like 
 Law has always been notoriously slow to adapt to new innovations. This is especially true when it comes to 
new technological innovations. Even though the legal framework for privacy is different in the EU and the 
United States, both jurisdictions seem to require consent for processing geolocation information. Notice 
and choice are often instrumental in keeping consumers comfortable with having their geolocation data 
collected and processed. 24 Acquiring consent before the collection of such data will also ensure compliance 
with legal requirements. However, considering the inherent shortcomings of the current legal landscape, 
it is likely that the self-regulatory frameworks of the industry will in the future have an even greater role in 
policing the use of new and emerging technologies. 
 What about data ownership? Many have suggested that digital contracting and  data ownership   would be 
the way of the future in the development of user privacy. This is not a novel idea. In fact, Hal R. Varian proposed 
assigning property rights in information 20 years ago. 25 Individuals could sell information about them, but this 
information could not be resold to third parties without an explicit agreement. Eli Noam also suggested that 
individuals should have the ability to sell information about themselves. 26 The concept of data ownership has, 
however, not been widely celebrated. The current framework has been successful, as consumers often choose 
to “agree” to the terms of service when the only alternative is to not use the service at all. 
 Moreover, the idea of owning data is much more complex than it seems, and it has been debated in the 
legal field for a long time. Information is quite different from tangible things in that many different people can 
“own” the same information at the same time. It is easily shared, leaky, and hard to control, which makes it 
difficult to be regarded as property in the traditional sense of the word. Even though the idea of data ownership 
is not completely vain, it is very likely not the road data privacy will be traveling on in the near future.

 A more likely approach for the foreseeable future is a service such as    www.locationcontrol.org  , 27 
which allows you to see the data that has been registered to certain beacons about your mobile device. 
The amount of beacons and retailers that use proximity marketing platforms is likely to grow exponentially 
in the coming years, which would make it nearly impossible to keep track of all parties tracking your data. 
A service such as that of  locationcontrol.org allows the user to easily opt-out, which will ensure that no 
proximity data will be collected against a consumer’s will. The Future of Privacy Forum has also provided 
a way for consumers to effortlessly opt-out of mobile location analytics by using the web site    www.smart-
places.org   . All consumers need to enter is their Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth address, and their devices will not 
be used for the mobile location analytics of the participating companies.

 Orchestration: Making Beacons 
Behave More Intelligently 
 
 
 John Coombs, Co-founder and CEO, Rover 
 The opportunity to better understand the physical context of our customers and communicate with them 
in a hyper-local and relevant fashion has beacon solution designers eager to execute and realize the great 
“promise” of beacons. 
 A simple scan through marketing industry publications might have us believe that with the purchase 
of some beacon hardware and a few sessions with our mobile agency, we can be in market, delivering the 
often-touted “customer experience of the future”. However, the reality is that there is a significant gap between 

CHAPTER 12 ■ ORCHESTRATION: MAKING BEACONS BEHAVE MORE INTELLIGENTLY
204
a simple Bluetooth-emitting piece of hardware (a beacon) and the type of scalable, end-user experience that 
drives the ROI we can really get excited about. As we have discussed in the previous chapters, there are indeed 
a number of components of the beacon “stack” that we must consider when looking to get real value out of a 
beacon strategy and have a deployment that behaves more intelligently. 
 The aim of this chapter is to make sense of the components of the stack beyond the hardware itself. This 
includes the creation, management, and design of your campaigns and content strategy—referred to here 
 as  beacon orchestration . Just as the symphony conductor ensures harmony through careful attention to his 
orchestra’s component parts, so too should the beacon solution designer. A successful beacon orchestration 
requires thoughtful evaluation of the pieces that will make up your deployment and a data-driven approach 
with careful attention to the end-user experience. 
 Intelligent orchestration will create value for the app owner and the end user. Crafting the right content 
strategy for your brand is crucial to successful outcomes. There is no silver bullet use-case in proximity 
marketing and a content strategy that works for one brand won’t necessarily work for another. Solution 
designers need to embrace this reality, recognizing that beacons and proximity marketing are new and 
determining your winning content strategy will require metric-driven iteration to ensure your approach is 
resonating with customers and driving the desired ROI for your business. A well architected orchestration 
layer can ensure that content iterations can be developed and deployed faster while consuming fewer 
resources. 
 What to look For 
 One of the most important factors in a successful beacon orchestration, whether in the early or later stages 
of your proximity marketing efforts, is the selection of your campaign or  content management system 
(CMS)  . Whether you decide to build your own solution, or use a third-party proximity orchestration 
system, you’ll want to evaluate the following areas when making a decision on the right solution for your 
business. 
 Features 
 At the most basic level of evaluation are the features and functionality that exist within the orchestration 
platform you choose to leverage. Some platforms will be loaded with glitzy features you’ll pay for but never 
end up using, while others will lack function that might be core to your success. For example. a scannable 
barcode feature for mobile couponing might be crucial to evaluating the ROI of a retail deployment, but 
might matter little in a museum use-case. Take a long-term view of the types of features that might come up 
in your environment. 
 While we will dive deeper into some important orchestration  features  , at a high-level, some you should 
consider are:
• 
 Content: Supported media types, native vs. web view, design customization 
• 
 Analytics: Content data as well as dwell time and customer pathing  
• 
 Segmentation: Ability to personalize and target content 
• 
 Frequency capping or content “limiters” 
• 
 Beacon mapping and fleet management 
• 
 Other proximity technologies supported

 Usability and Support 
 When we think  about  beacons and mobile, a lot of attention is paid to end-user experience (UX) and user 
experience testing. Attention should also be paid to the UX and usability of your CMS itself. As you work 
through use-cases and build your proximity strategy, you and your team will likely spend more time than 
you might expect designing, authoring, and evaluating your beacon campaigns. Ease of use and usability 
can mean the difference between an extremely frustrating or positive experience that allows you to get the 
most out of the platform. In addition to the usability of the CMS, it’s important to understand what support 
is provided in terms of online resources and dedicated account and developer support as you work through 
integration and launch. 
 Third-Party Integrations 
 No CMS will “do it all”. While many platforms might claim to be a super platform that will solve all of your 
needs, the solution you go with will likely not excel at all of the components of the beacon stack that are 
important to your business. You’ll want to know if the platform provider you work with supports any third-
party integrations that enhance the core offering.
 Beacon hardware —One of the first integrations you will likely consider will be 
on the hardware side. A number of beacon hardware providers have APIs that 
can connect with your CMS, displaying relevant data about your beacon fleet 
such as battery life or your beacon configurations. Having one login to craft 
your content and manage your beacon hardware will be important for scalable 
success. 
 Ad networks —As you look longer term, you might want to consider more 
advanced integrations such as platforms that pool or share proximity data or 
provide content feeds from ad networks or other sources. 
 Analytics —While your CMS might provide analytics out of the box, there 
are vendors that offer dedicated proximity analytics solutions that will likely 
outperform what a CMS provider will be able to provide on their own. If 
proximity analytics is important to you, you’ll want to assess this type of option.  
 CRM  —Working with beacons will open the doors to a sizeable and extremely 
valuable data set. Like any data, it will only be as valuable as your ability to derive 
insights from it and, equally as important, have it complement your existing 
customer data. Integration with your CRM will expedite your ability to have a 
more holistic view of your customer and drive smarter content. 
 Push  —While our focus is on proximity-triggered content, content derived from 
other behavioral triggers will continue to play an important role in driving app 
engagement. Your beacon-based content should complement your other forms 
of notifications such as push, not compete with it. 
 Indoor navigation —Indoor mapping and navigation based on beacons and 
other technology is continuing to emerge as a highly specialized offering. Some 
newer vendors as well as large incumbents have compelling in-store navigation 
offerings that, if integrated properly, can complement your beacon content 
strategy. 

CHAPTER 12 ■ ORCHESTRATION: MAKING BEACONS BEHAVE MORE INTELLIGENTLY
206
 Mobile SDK/UI 
 If you don’t take a custom approach to building beacon content into your app, the CMS you choose to 
go with will likely have a corresponding mobile SDK, which will take care of beacon handling logic as 
well as the mobile user interface. Because the end-user experience is the pillar of successful beacon 
orchestration, this is an especially important consideration. At the heart of getting content right is the way 
in which beacon-triggered content is presented to your app users. You’ll want to make sure you have a 
good understanding of the type of content you can deliver, as well as the way in which it is delivered. Some 
important things to consider here are:
• 
 Is the content on the user's mobile device presented as a web view or native content? 
• 
 In what form is the content presented and how can it be customized in the CMS? 
• 
 How flexible are the design elements? Are they standardized or highly flexible to fit 
the look and feel of your brand? 
• 
 For more advanced use-cases, is the SDK open source allowing agency or internal 
developers to further customize? 
• 
 What media types are supported? 
• 
 Is deeplinking proximity content to native app functionality supported?  
• 
 Does the UI support scannable mobile coupons or other methods to track content 
conversion? 
 Segmentation and CRM Integration 
 While  segmentation and content personalization might not be a priority in the first iteration of your beacon 
strategy, they will eventually play an important role. Proximity is a key pillar of relevance and engagement 
on mobile, but marrying proximity with personalization is a standard all proximity marketers should strive 
for. Some of the best engagement and ROI comes from content that considers both the user's location and 
relevant attributes. 
 In many ways, beacons act as cookies for the physical world, providing a host of data points that can paint 
a more holistic view of a customer and complementing digital data with a physical world understanding. A 
real-world example of this can be understood by comparing an e-commerce shopper’s “clicks” to view bicycles 
online with a shopper’s presence in the bicycle aisle of a brick and mortar retail store. Just as the online retailer 
can retarget and cater content based on their shoppers’ potential purchase interests (as demonstrated by 
clicks), so too can the brick and mortar retailer turn physical world data (dwell time) into a more informed 
content strategy going forward. 
 Of course, this sort of data is useful only if it is actionable. On one hand, you may have a fairly robust 
 CRM you have built over the years that could inform proximity content. In this case, the CMS you choose 
should have the APIs and integration capabilities to drive smarter proximity content based on the view of 
the customer you have already started to build. This “pipe” should go both ways. As offline brick and mortar 
data is gathered, it should complement your existing CRM, helping you round out the view of the customers. 
 The actionable step coming out of these integrations is to then tie this more holistic customer view into 
personalization of your content strategy. Whether through variable text features that make content highly 
personal, or offers and messaging specific to your customers’ preferences, turning data into highly relevant 
and personal content is key to getting the most out of your proximity strategy. 

CHAPTER 12 ■ ORCHESTRATION: MAKING BEACONS BEHAVE MORE INTELLIGENTLY
207
 Support for Complementary Location and Proximity Technologies 
 While the focus of this book is on beacons, a number of other technologies can be powerful elements of 
a  proximity strategy . The most prominent example of these technologies is  geofencing . Does the platform 
you are looking at consider other technologies in order to deliver a superior end-user experience? If done 
right, geofencing can be a very complementary and scalable addition to your solution. Geofences allow you 
to transition from “macro” proximity regions such as a city block or mall property down to the more micro 
proximity regions associated with beacons. 
 iBeacon and Eddystone — In addition to other proximity technologies, there are protocols that have 
been built on top of Bluetooth tech. Perhaps the most exciting and impactful is Google’s Eddystone. 
As outlined in Chapter   5 , the Eddystone protocol opens the door for different types of data and ways of 
communicating with mobile devices. This protocol is too big of a force to be ignored and you will want to feel 
confident that the CMS provider you choose to go with supports this other beacon “language”. 
 The Vision Driving Your CMS Vendor 
 In addition to all the tech, features, and integrations a CMS vendor may provide, it’s valuable to understand 
the underlying vision and direction of the  CMS vendor   itself. As the other chapters have articulated, the 
emerging beacon ecosystem is a “wild west” of opportunity and views around how the ecosystem should 
mature and take shape vary significantly. 
 For example, some teams view beacon infrastructure as a foundation upon which an ad network can 
be built. Others might simply view a beacon installation as the foundation for a more utilitarian mobile 
experience, guiding the user from point a to point b with a heavy focus on navigation. These are very 
different views of the beacon world and will result in different feature priorities and product development as 
their platform matures over time. 
 Additionally, some beacon platform providers are born out of predecessor technologies and might view 
beacons as simply another “feature” that can be added to an existing platform. I would argue that proximity 
content is not an afterthought that can be easily layered into any existing platform, but rather a pillar around 
which a platform should be built. Many push, and other mobile marketing automation businesses, were 
born out of industries such as gaming, with products crafted and shaped to reflect the sheer volume-based 
nature of that industry. Does a team who built a product around this type of engagement view proximity 
the same way? Do they have in place the user experience and design talent to help you execute the type of 
engaging and content rich campaigns that you desire?  
 Scalability 
 Another important question that would apply to the selection of most technical vendors is how they view 
scale and the underlying technology that supports your deployment at  scale  . This is particularly important 
in a space where scalability is one of the primary challenges facing beacon solution designers. In addition 
to the ability to monitor and manage large-scale hardware deployments, it is important to assess what 
provisions are in place on the content management side. For example, does your CMS provide user roles 
and permission to allow for content management by region? Your Manhattan content strategy may look 
vastly different from your efforts in Bismarck, North Dakota. What role does your content platform provider 
play in this configuration and set up, both in your physical venues and in the cloud? How do they view the 
challenges associated with deployment at scale? Can your beacons be configured in the cloud or do they 
require on the ground set up? It’s important to ask these types of questions to better understand how your 
efforts can scale.  

CHAPTER 12 ■ ORCHESTRATION: MAKING BEACONS BEHAVE MORE INTELLIGENTLY
208
 Looking to Smarter Content: Turning Hardware Into 
Engagement 
 The best campaign management solution can only be as effective as the content strategy it drives. The right 
content strategy will engage and drive frequency in mobile usage, while a poor content strategy will likely 
result in your users turning off notifications, or worse, uninstalling your app. 
 Frequency Capping or  Limiters — Smart content strategy starts with some basics and progresses to 
more advanced considerations as the proximity strategy matures. At the most basic level should be content 
rules baked into your app or CMS vendor's SDK. This should include logic ensuring users don’t see the same 
content twice if they happen to exit and re-enter a beacon region within a short period of time. The ability 
to limit the volume of content and frequency of how it is delivered (i.e., push notification versus passive 
presentation of content) should also be within your control as a beacon solution architect. 
 Context Triggers  for Content— All marketers understand the importance of mobile, and most are 
aware of the fact that relevance and context are emerging as the most important elements of a successful 
mobile strategy. A user's proximity or location (whether micro or macro) is one of the fundamental building 
blocks of relevance, but it isn’t nearly as effective without an additional context layer, often referred to as 
one-to-one or personalization. Marrying proximity data with CRM data can have a significant impact on the 
quality and relevance of your content strategy. While platforms and campaign management software can 
help with this type of execution, thought needs to go into the factors and objectives driving your strategy. 
Let’s look at a grocery store use-case to further flush this out. From a CRM integration perspective, we may 
know that our shopper prefers healthy and organic options. In this case, we can drive smart content by 
choosing to present her with relevant content (the launch of our new private label organics line) at the right 
time (her “digital flyer” as she enters the store). Looking to the in-store experience itself, we could leverage a 
“pairing” or “purchase-path” driven approach, such as by directing our shopper to our rich selection of red 
wine after her dwell time in the meat section. 
 User-First Design— In general, the best content strategy is one that is user- first , marketing second. 
Beacons and proximity are emerging as the most powerful and engaging channels available to marketers but 
that power comes with obvious risk. There is no better way to get your app uninstalled than to push spammy 
or purely coupon-centric content multiple times as a customer navigates your store. Taking a user-first 
content approach builds a relationship foundation with your users that demonstrates your appreciation for 
their business, and the right to communicate with them using location. A proximity strategy built on this 
user-first foundation will give you more “rope” as you work through the inevitable mistakes and challenges 
of getting your strategy perfect. 
 Furthermore, your users will begin to associate your app as a utilitarian tool, or exclusive channel where 
they can get more out their engagement with your brand. The ability to use the channel to drive sales will 
come naturally from an audience who has already bought into their mobile experience with you. Your ability 
to influence on mobile is only as strong as the size of the user base you want to influence. Many mobile 
marketers fall into the trap of trying to get the marketing part right before they even have a base to market to. 
Surprise, delight, engage, and reward your users with utilitarian tools before you take a “coupon-first” content 
approach and you will be rewarded. With hundreds of retail deployments under our belts, we have seen a 
clear lift in campaigns that I would suggest were “user-first” in nature, with content open rates of 45-65%. 
 Three key focuses that can drive this user-first content are:
• 
 Utility—Does the proximity feature or content improve the customer experience? 
Does it make purchasing faster? Does it make finding a product easier? 
• 
 Incentive or Reward—Is your mobile app, specifically the proximity content on it, a 
rewarding channel? Do you marry your loyalty program with your proximity content?  
• 
 Exclusivity or “surprise and delight”—Do you offer exclusive in-store only offers? 

CHAPTER 12 ■ ORCHESTRATION: MAKING BEACONS BEHAVE MORE INTELLIGENTLY
209
 Summary 
 As architects work through how beacons can be applied to a business, one of the most important factors in a 
successful outcome will be uncovering the content strategy that engages the customers and the tools used to 
get there. Beacon or proximity content is still very new to most and it will take some trial and error to get to 
winning use-cases. 
 The emerging proximity opportunity is distinct from traditional push and opens the doors to completely 
new ways of connecting with mobile users. It’s an opportunity to create value for users as they navigate their 
way through your physical space. You need to connect with partners, agencies, or proximity marketing teams 
that understand the nuances of proximity and have the long-term view to help you build that dialogue with 
your users. 
 Strategies should recognize the value of a user-first approach with careful attention to the specific 
journey of your customer and the nuances of your brand. Having utility, incentive, and exclusive offers 
driving your content strategy is one of the best ways to be user-first in your approach.

 CHAPTER 13  
 Understanding Beacon Networks 
    By Steve Statler and Kjartan Slette, COO and co-founder, Unacast 
 “It's hard to break into a network once it's formed.” 
 — Elon Musk 

CHAPTER 13 ■ UNDERSTANDING BEACON NETWORKS
212
 The emergence of beacon networks may be the most significant factor in the success of businesses fighting 
to succeed in the beacosystem. 
 Beacons have some remarkable properties. They are low in  cost , easy to  install , have increasingly 
sophisticated sensors, and can be used to create some really cool user experiences. We have grounds for 
optimism about the future of the beacosystem. The Proxbook report 1 , which surveys the number of beacons 
deployed as reported by the vendors in its database, is seeing major growth. As of Q4 2015, approximately 
four million beacons had been registered as deployed worldwide. These numbers align with ABI’s growth 
projections of 400 million beacons to be deployed by 2020. 
 However, with two years having passed since the deployment of the first Bluetooth beacon, it would 
be hard to argue that beacons have achieved the full potential that many of us see. Why aren’t there more 
beacon-enabled apps? Why aren’t beacons in every major retail, entertainment, and hospitality venue? 
What’s missing? Do we need longer battery life, better range, improved accuracy, or more sensors? While all 
of those things would be great and will almost certainty happen, we don’t think those are the critical success 
factors. 
 We believe that the success of the beacon ecosystem depends on the growth of beacon networks. In 
order to appreciate that dynamic, it’s worth revisiting the following:
• 
 Physical effort —Unlike regular software deployments, beacon-enabled apps require 
a lot of physical coordination: the investment of many more people on the ground to 
purchase, distribute, install, monitor and maintain the beacons. That’s a lot of work 
for businesses, like retailers, that have other things to do with their limited staff, time, 
and money. 
• 
 Time  —We have seen that deployments take a long time to graduate beyond the 
proof-of-concept stage and rollout, even for large, sophisticated retailers; that is, the 
top tier with large IT, merchandising and program management functions. Macy’s 
has been a leader in deploying beacons, but it’s taken over two years from the first 
deployment to a national rollout. Facebook hit the headlines with a ubiquitous app 
that most people have installed and beacons that are free, but very few of us have 
ever been into a store that has Facebook beacons. 
• 
 Cost and Complexity —It’s ironic; the emergence and breakthrough of the Bluetooth 
beacon has been on the basis of its low cost and simplicity, but what’s holding the 
beacosystem back may be that beacons are not low cost and simple enough. At least, 
not when every app needs its own set of beacons in order to function. 
 The Value of the Network 
 What if there were a better way? What if we didn’t have to bothered with all the issues we discussed in the 
deployment chapter—the ten Ps: Planning, Placement, Propagation, Procurement, Permission, Privacy/
Public Notices, Process, Power, Presentation, and (gasp!) People. 
 Well, it turns out there is. Some of the most successful businesses are using beacons that service 
more than one app. This one-to-many relationship between beacons and third-party apps is the defining 
characteristic of a beacon network. 
 These beacons are infrastructure. The hard work has already been done. Someone decided to make an 
investment upfront so that new apps and ideas can be spun up fast. With beacon networks, app developers, 
rather than waiting for beacons to be put in place, can use beacons that are already out there.

213
 Infrastructure is hard, expensive, and requires vision to build. But thanks to infrastructure, when we 
plan a road trip to a major city, we don’t have to worry about whether there are highways in place. We have 
the infrastructure of an Interstate Highway System that was built following Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Federal-
Aid Highway Act in 1938 2 . We find our way around those roads thanks to the standards for signage and 
numbering that date back to infrastructure decisions made in 1925 3 . 
 What we see emerging in the world of beacons has parallels to these developments in road 
infrastructure that led to an explosion of road transport and growth in economic prosperity. Like America’s 
first road systems, beacon projects are being deployed by a multitude of largely independent entrepreneurs. 
They are providing ease of access to the beacosystem, but they are operating in fragments. The maps of 
where they are located are often incomplete and disconnected, but the potential that comes with joining up 
these resources is clear. 
 Of course, all networks are not the same. We see them falling into three categories, each one building on 
the services of the former:
• 
 Beacon Directories —These form a road map of beacons owned by other 
organizations. They don’t grant access to the beacons, but finding where the beacons 
are is a start. The beacon owners, not the operators of the directories, control access 
to these beacons. 
• 
 Beacon Access Networks —These are more tightly integrated collections of beacons, 
whose access is controlled via the network, where you have to pay to play.  
• 
 Beacon Commerce Networks —These are a class of beacon network where the APIs 
and services offered are at a higher level than typical beacon APIs. A commerce 
network supports use-cases that are specific to certain commerce applications such 
as advertising, coupons, promotions, or payments.    
 Let’s look in more detail at each of these, with a set of specific examples that we can learn from. 
 Beacon Directories 
 As beacons proliferate, inquiring minds want to know how many beacons have been deployed and where 
they are. Manufacturers self-report to industry analysts (like ABI) how many beacons they have produced 
and will allude to some of the projects where they are being deployed. They can also record this information 
on  Proxbook.com , but it would be nice to have more precise information about what has actually been 
deployed and exactly where the devices are. 
 With iBeacon providing a standard way of identifying beacons across manufacturers and the 
proliferation of mobile apps capable of watching out for beacons as their owners travel around the world, 
sites have appeared that crowdsource the search of these beacons in the wild and record their details in 
directories that can be accessed online. 
 2 President Dwight D. Eisenhower received credit for his key part in the building of the U.S. Interstate Highway system, 
as he presided over much of its construction and grew the scope of the project. His insight into the military applications 
of an Interstate Highway System allowed the scope of FDR’s original vision to be greatly expanded. FDR proposed the 
Federal-Aid Highway Act, which was a study to investigate its construction. This was a works project that had to wait 
until after World War II before it started in earnest.  
 3 A Federal Joint Board on Interstate Highways was formed to standardize the naming of highways and the signage, 
which, prior to 1925, were named by individual associations trying to attract drivers to use the roads they had built. 
Names and signs varied to the extent that even professional drivers would frequently get lost and confused.

 Figure 13-2.    The Radius Locate app is available for free on the Android Play app store 
 WikiBeacon  uses the tens of thousands of downloads of Radius’ Locate App to look for beacons that are 
broadcasting nearby (Figure  13-2 ). The Locate App is free, available on both iOS and Android, and detects 
AltBeacon, iBeacon, and Eddystone beacons. The app can also be used as a beacon itself. While performing 
these tasks for users around the world, it reports back the details of each beacon it detects to the WikiBeacon 
database. Given that Locate is only installed on a fairly small subset of phones (and likely a self-selecting 
one, at that), the results it reports back are not a complete picture of every beacon installed. What it does 
provide is a small but indicative sample of where beacons have been deployed.

 Figure 13-3.  WikiBeacon search page 
 WikiBeacon  offers three ways to view the sightings in its database. 
 First, users of the registry can search for beacons using a given  UUID , which will return how many 
beacons with that address have been found in a given time period (see Figure  13-3 ).

 If the major and minor device numbers are added, a specific beacon can be located, in which case the 
location of the beacon is reported back (see Figure  13-4 ).

 According to  Sensoro , they have shipped over 110,000 beacons in China. We don’t know if all of them 
have been deployed, and there are certainly more beacons from other vendors deployed in that country, 
but a ratio of 110 to 6, or 18:1, gives us an extremely rough approximation of the ratio of the sample to actual 
beacons deployed. 
 The listing of cities with the most beacons in Figure  13-6  is interesting. While it’s surprising that San 
Francisco didn’t make the top ten, the Bay Area cities are well represented in the top 40. Interestingly, Mecca 
features at 23, versus San Francisco at 44.

 The listing of U.S. states with the most beacons detailed in Figure  13-7 seems to be in line with what one 
might expect, given all of the high-tech innovation centered in California and Massachusetts. And one can 
imagine, given all of the theme park venues and hospitality applications, that Florida earns its honorable 
ranking in third place.

 One of the most entertaining ways of viewing the WikiBeacon database is through the  Google Maps 
interface (see Figure  13-8 ). 
 From the world view, you can zoom down to the street level to see where beacons have been sighted 
around the world. From here, we can see the deployment of beacons all along Regent Street, one of the 
busiest shopping streets in the United Kingdom (see Figure  13-9 ).

CHAPTER 13 ■ UNDERSTANDING BEACON NETWORKS
221
 Reveal’s TheBeaconMap 
 A similar but more recently launched beacon directory service comes from  Reveal Mobile (see Figure  13-10 ). 
 They also search  for  beacons from mobile apps that contain their SDK. Their main business is to 
provide a mobile analytics platform that can infer purchase intent and attribute the effectiveness of 
promotions by measuring visits to locations that have been promoted. Their SDK has been used in hundreds 
of news and weather apps. With this number of apps and the resulting increase in coverage, they have an 
opportunity to spot more of the beacons that are distributed in the United States. 
 Currently, most of the beacons listed in their directory come from lists that are sent by partners. 
According to their CEO, the dynamic addition of beacons that are spotted by the apps that contain their API 
is throttled back so that a beacon is registered only if it’s seen very frequently (200 times). Apparently, this is 
done to avoid false positives from mobile devices that are broadcasting beacon packets. 
 One feature that distinguishes TheBeaconMap from WikiBeacon is its ability to search for beacons 
based on metadata. In Figure  13-11 , that metadata is the name of the retailer hosting the beacons, but one 
can imagine other information, like the type of store or even the type of people that have visited the beacon, 
as useful additions. 
 Figure 13-10.  Reveal Mobile’s directory of over 100,000 beacons in the United States 
 

CHAPTER 13 ■ UNDERSTANDING BEACON NETWORKS
222
 For the  TheBeaconMap to identify unaffiliated 4 beacons via the apps Reveal is integrated in, as with 
WikiBeacon, it is reliant on the beacons offering open access using iBeacon (and Eddystone-UID)  without 
any conditional access features such as UMM rotation. We see these “vanilla” beacons as an important 
subset of the beacons that are deployed, but a subset nonetheless. It seems likely that much of the beacon 
growth is going to come from beacons that are secured with conditional access, so that their owners can 
charge for access. For investment to happen, there needs to be an ROI and “paying to play” is an obvious way 
to achieve that return. 
 The use (or future use) of conditional access is one of the attributes that distinguishes the next category 
of beacon networks that we will discuss. 
 Beacon Access Networks 
 Beacon directories are a great resource and have been provided as a free service. In contrast, beacon access 
networks are usually all about the money. Their construction is a very deliberate attempt to enable control 
and monetization of large numbers of beacons. They include the same functions as the beacon registries, 
but add features, such as more detailed metadata management, analytics, and conditional access control. 
Rather than surveying other peoples’ beacons that are broadcasting in the clear, these beacons have been 
actively registered as a result of a deal between the venue owner and the network operator. The beacon 
access network operator either owns the beacons or there is some kind of business relationship that may 
involve revenue sharing between the beacon owner and the operator. With beacon registries, however, there 
may be no relationship between the registry operator and the beacon owner.

CHAPTER 13 ■ UNDERSTANDING BEACON NETWORKS
223
 We are going to drill down into several examples of different kinds of beacon access networks in this 
chapter: SITA’s Common Use Beacon Registry, which is focused on airports; the Gimbal network, being 
deployed in partnership with out of home (OOH) advertisers; the Proxama network in UK high streets 
(or “main streets” in the United States) and London taxis; and, lastly, Unacast’s Prox network, which is 
focused on retargeting. 
 Beacon Access Network Functions 
 Before we get into those examples, though, let’s first think about the functions that need to be in place if 
beacons are going to be aggregated and access to them is to be sold. 
 Creating a beacon network is a non-trivial engineering and business development task, so the 
companies working on this are developing the pieces incrementally. What we are going to outline is a 
conceptual view of what we think will emerge based on experience so far (see Figure  13-12 ). There will, no 
doubt, be variations on this structure. 
 Venue Owner Approval and Reporting 
 If beacons are going to be situated in a venue, both the owner of the beacons and the venue owner will want 
a say in who is going to be granted access to those beacons. In some cases, the venue owner and the beacon 
owner will be one and the same, but that’s not necessarily the case. 
 If the venue is a store, for instance, the retailer will not be happy if direct competitors are being 
sold access to beacons in their store. Each store may have views on which brands can use their beacons, 
depending on whether they stock the brand’s product and any other deals they may have in place with the 
brand or its competitors. This is important, in part, because if a product doesn’t reflect the values of the 
retail venue, (if it’s a budget product in a luxury store, or an escort service targeting hotel bars), this could 
create issues for both the retailer and customers. For retailers in particular, control over their venue is a “hot 
button” issue. If they feel you are taking control from them, then your proposal to place beacons in their 
store is unlikely to be welcomed. This is a challenge for vendors like Google who were blocked from retailers’ 
stores when they tried to implement their first mobile payments system. 
 Figure 13-12.  Components of a beacon access network 
 

CHAPTER 13 ■ UNDERSTANDING BEACON NETWORKS
224
 Venues may also want control over how much should be charged for access to their beacons. 
Depending on how access to the beacons is being charged, they will want to know they are getting a fair 
rate. Remember, a core competency of most retailers is merciless negotiation with their suppliers (not to 
be forgotten when brainstorming ideas for beacon startups). Retailers also may want to limit the number of 
apps that are being triggered by their beacons in order to avoid a beacon trigger overload as people step into 
 their  store. 
 A console that allows them to approve which apps are going to be using their beacons is, therefore, a 
desirable function. It may be that, in some cases, this control is done via a phone call between staff working 
for the network operator and the retailer, or there may be a listing of access requests that the venue owner 
can use to approve requests. 
 Once the request has been granted, then the venue owner will want to know what the traffic has been 
like and, ideally, who was accessing the beacon. As such, a reporting function needs to be available so they 
can review that activity and leverage the intelligence that the activities will yield.      
 Data Ownership and Privacy Management 
 This brings us to one of the central issues with running a beacon network: who owns the data? All the 
stakeholders will raise their hands at this point. The venue owner will feel they own the data. The network 
operator will feel the same way. After all, they need to pay for the development of the beacon system 
somehow, and there is clearly value in understanding who has been visiting a venue and their movements 
in that space. The other parties who may feel they own the data are the app developer and, of course, the 
app user themselves. The platform, therefore, should track who has rights to the slices of the data each 
stakeholder has a claim to, and should manage the user’s privacy accordingly. 
 And then, if a user opts out, their detailed data should be purged from this complex system that is 
building a picture of them with inputs from what could be a large number of companies. Each of those 
companies may have different requirements as to which of the other parties can benefit from the data they 
are collecting. For example, a retailer will not want to find that their competitor is benefiting from their 
insights into the behavior of a shared customer. Additionally, if a user opts out, there is the issue of how far 
back in history their records should be purged, and how that will affect the aggregated picture of what’s been 
happening. For example, if a user opts out and their visits have contributed to a department’s ranking as 
“most visited,” should that ranking be adjusted after the user’s data is  removed  ? 
 But even beyond the technology, these privacy rights and agreements to share need to be considered 
in the contractual framework that all parties use to access the system. These considerations will also impact 
the design of the user experience. There need to be notices that make it clear to the user what is happening, 
but without making the sign up process scary or cumbersome. There also need to be opt-out mechanisms 
that are simple enough to be understood, but don’t undermine the adoption of the system. Hopefully your 
lawyers, UE designers, and business development team get on well, because there is likely to be a lot of 
debate about this. 
 It should also be clear what happens to the data about the user if they opt-out and who has visibility 
of it if they opt-in. The beacon network needs to have this baked into all their contracts and contain a way 
to make sure the policies in those agreements are enforced by all the network participants. Otherwise, the 
network can quickly unravel in the event of a complaint or negative press or  social media coverage .  
 App Owner View 
 App developers need their own portal into the network access management system that will allow them 
to select the beacons that they want to use. For many solutions, this could be based on selecting beacons 
on a map. A more scalable approach for bigger projects might be to select beacons based on metadata. For 
example, a developer might want a trigger based on three metadata filters: all entry beacons, in grocery 
stores, and in the Northeast United States. 

CHAPTER 13 ■ UNDERSTANDING BEACON NETWORKS
225
 In order to unlock the conditional access control of the beacons, the developer will need to use a 
proprietary API that allows beacons to be seen by those who are authorized to do so based on a period of 
time or number of times, depending on what they have paid for. 
 The app owners, because they also have the opportunity to enrich the metadata associated with each 
beacon beyond what the beacon owner has recorded, will also need their own view of the analytics offered 
by the system. It’s the app owner, after all, that understands what the user is using the beacon for. They will 
know if a beacon trigger is a redemption of a coupon by a loyal customer or a visit from someone who is just 
browsing. The beacon owner won’t know, but the app owner will. Therefore, there should be mechanisms to 
enable this capture and sharing of information.  
 The  Core Beacon Access Network Platform 
 The beacon network will need a very capable fleet management system. Beacons, as infrastructure to third-
party developers, are likely to have more stringent service level agreements than an internal deployment 
might require, so the ability to detect issues and resolve them in a timely manner becomes even more 
important. 
 At the center of this platform, there will be an increasing need for a very sophisticated billing system. 
The downside is these systems can be expensive to develop, and their limitations end up impacting the kind 
of business models that can be offered to close deals. Yet, having a flexible and efficient billing system is 
critical to reconcile the desire of the venue owners to maximize the monetization of the beacons on their site 
and the desire of developers to minimize their costs. As a result, the systems will need the ability to change 
billing rules for different customers. Further, they need to act as settlement systems by both administering 
different ways to charge for access to the beacons and sharing the revenue with the beacon and venue 
owner. If the billing system can’t support the deals needed for adoption to grow, either the deals won’t get 
done or they will get done and chaos will ensue, with legions of finance people trying to use spreadsheets to 
make up for the fact that what was sold is not what can be delivered. 
 Early in the life of these systems, the deals made are likely to be more simplistic, and so the need for this 
kind of sophisticated engine will be less. Indeed, for pilot projects, the beacon access may even be offered 
for free as the ROI is being proven. A simple system where developers are paying by active user is a sensible 
first step. Ultimately, though, developers may be asked to pay based on the number of beacons they want to 
use and how often they are used. It’s possible to imagine that some beacons in premium locations might be 
charged for at a higher rate than others. For the highly coveted locations, bidding for access to beacons may 
become a requirement. On top of that, frequency limits on how often beacons can be used to prompt a given 
user could make these systems  extremely  complex. 
 Mind you, this shopping list of functions is a look far down the road. So, instead, let us consider some 
examples of beacon access networks that are live now and discuss the approaches that have been adopted. 
 Beacon Access Network Examples

 Airports: The Ultimate Target for Beacons 
 Airports have become early adaptors of beacon technology. The reason for this is, hopefully, clear. Most 
airports are like malls, but with a captive audience of affluent and tech savvy shoppers. And if that wasn’t 
reason enough, once travelers have stocked up on food, drink and gadgets, they get on a plane. They then 
suffer long enough to develop more wants and needs, with exhaustion that erodes their will power enough to 
become an “easy mark” when they land at another airport. There, they can continue the retail therapy. Bear 
in mind, even a second tier airport can host 20 million passengers a year, and the top ten airports have twice 
as many visitors as the top 10 shopping malls. 

CHAPTER 13 ■ UNDERSTANDING BEACON NETWORKS
226
 Business travelers, in particular, are the surely the best marketing targets. They are away from the 
moderating influence of spouses, and so are prone to making purchases to comfort themselves or endear 
them to absent loved ones. They also tend to travel regularly, so the cost of customer acquisition can be 
amortized over years of repeated travel.  
 A significant portion of the funding for airports comes from a share of the revenue from passengers 
shopping and parking. At the same time, airlines are trying to optimize efficiency and differentiate the 
experience they offer in a scalable way, so all the big airlines and a number of airports have their own apps 
(see Figure  13-13 ). It’s hard to imagine a better market segment for beacon technology to be deployed. 
 Given that airports serve multiple airlines, and airlines fly into multiple airports, it makes sense to 
have consistency in the way beacons are used across those organizations. While this is a mouthwatering 
opportunity for entrepreneurs, there is already a non-profit organization that is probably best placed to meet 
the need: SITA.

operations 
 

CHAPTER 13 ■ UNDERSTANDING BEACON NETWORKS
227
 SITA Who? 
 The Société Internationale de Télécommunications Aéronautiques, or SITA, is the number one provider of 
the information technologies that airports and airlines use to run their operations. SITA was founded by 
11 airlines in 1949, and now has over 400 air industry members and over 4,000 employees. Their 
membership and governance boards are made up of a “Who’s Who” of airlines and airports. 
 Common Use 
 In years gone by, every airline had their own IT infrastructure at airports; signage, computer terminals, 
networks, kiosks and phone systems were incompatible across the airlines. And why not? They were 
competitors, after all. The problem with this was that, when one airline grew and another shrank, the 
reallocation of the gate space from one to the other was expensive and slow. Think, if you can, of the airlines 
that existed 20 years ago. The names are different now. Since these changes are likely to continue, airport 
operators decided to adopt a strategy of building common use infrastructure, networks, displays, and 
terminals that were consistent and shared across all airlines. That way, when the next merger happens, all 
that is required is a few configuration changes and the displays, phones, and computers at one gate can be 
switched from one airline to another. 
 SITA  Goals 
 In order for beacon-enabled apps from airlines, airports, and travel app developers to work across airlines 
and airports, it made sense for SITA to invest in building beacon management infrastructure that would 
help their customers adopt beacons in a way that is consistent across different locations. This aligns with the 
common use strategy that they have for management of other technologies. 
 The functionality of the  SITA  registry centers on the ability to search for beacons at a given airport, using 
a standard metadata structure that is specific to airport use-cases, to implement apps that can use location 
and proximity with the help of the SITA APIs. 
 SITA was early to market in identifying fleet management and monitoring of beacon health as a key 
requirement, and so this is also addressed in the services SITA provides. 
 Free is a pretty good price, too. SITA doesn’t charge its members for the registry, which puts it in a 
strong position versus competing offerings. 
 SITA Beacon Use-Cases 
 There’s no shortage of use-cases to be supported to make the life of passengers at airports more convenient. 
The selected use-cases will impact the number of beacons that need to be deployed; wayfinding will require 
more beacons than simple check-in use-cases, for instance. The number of beacons at a terminal can range 
between 500 and 2, 000  for a larger airport with applications that require denser coverage. These are the 
use-cases that SITA has focused on (this is a restructured version courtesy of the SITA web site):

 Metadata 
 The kinds of  metadata associated with each beacon are airport specific. See Figure  13-14 for an example of 
that data. Beacons at departure gates are tagged with the airport code, terminal identifier, gate identifier, 
latitude/longitude, and the details of the next flight leaving from the gate.  
  Figure 13-14.  SITA dashboard showing the metadata captured for beacon sited at a gate 
Courtesy of SITA 
 Part of the value added by SITA is that the metadata can be integrated with flight management and 
baggage management systems that are handled by other SITA systems, so that the context provided goes 
beyond simple proximity information and can include information like the flight that delivered the baggage 
at a given carrousel. In this way, SITA is making it easier for app developers to create useful apps as well 
as creating a barrier to entry for other competing systems, as those competitors might find such systems 
integration work quite costly.

 Architecture 
 The  SITA architecture uses a set of open sourced APIs published on GitHub to expose its services via the 
cloud. See Figure  13-15 for an overview of that architecture. A web console is provided to update the beacon 
information and monitor the system. 
 For airports that have embraced the rest of SITA’s applications infrastructure, this system (see Figure  13-16 ) 
is a very appealing way to ensure that beacon deployments can be well managed and will integrate with the 
apps being developed by airlines and third-party developers.

 The Future 
 Currently, SITA only supports  Apple’s iBeacon protocol , but their product team has expressed a desire to 
support the Eddystone standard and to offer a conditional access layer so that airports can control which 
apps can see their beacons. 
 Eighteen months from its launch in 2014, 15 airports are using the registry, including Miami 
International Airport and an American Airlines hub. SITA is working with the other industry associations, 
IATA (airlines) and ACI (airports), who are reviewing the registry for their members with a view to 
recommending its use across the global industry. 
 While airports are just one vertical, we would argue that it’s one of the most important in terms of 
volumes of affluent and influential users. SITA’s progress in this focused offering provides a glimpse of how 
beacon networks could evolve in other market segments.

232
 Gimbal 
 Gimbal  represents what may be the biggest, broadest beacon access network play. Having been carved out 
of the semiconductor giant that is Qualcomm, its DNA must have “go big or go home” encoded into it. This 
is not a small bootstrap 5 approach to building a beacon business. Some of the networks that we will cover 
in the next section on beacon commerce networks have focused on a single market segment, such as retail. 
Gimbal’s product play includes outdoors, indoors, retail, sports venues, cities, events, museums, and more. 
Its product includes beacons, geofencing, contextual targeting, push facilities, and analytics tools that could 
be applied to an incredibly broad set of markets. 
 Part of the challenge with taking this approach is that much of the market isn’t ready to embrace the 
idea of beacon access on demand. Many venue owners are either suspicious of opening up their beacons 
to third-party companies, or they find it hard to comprehend a model where “you build it and they will 
come”. As a result, many of the larger retailers are caught between fear and greed with respect to investing 
in a beacon network. That is, fear that this technology will be a “white elephant 6 ” that isn’t worth the effort, 
and fear that putting beacons in their store for CPG brands to use will weaken their position of control of the 
customer relationship (because brands may bypass them and sell directly online). Yet, there is the possibility 
that if they let a third-party beacon provider into this position of power, they will have to share too much of 
the profits if the network does well. 
 Some retailers are installing beacon networks, but they tend to be what we would describe as beacon 
commerce networks with a very specific retail application and a complete solution stack. It seems that if you 
are going to put beacons in a retailer’s store in this early stage of development of the beacosystem, you need 
a complete solution with a specific set of apps that align with a retailer’s short-term goals. As a result, many 
of the early retail projects we have seen Gimbal win have been like a beachhead. They support a single point 
application, but the company hasn’t broken out of that position to join them all together. The beacons going 
into the Apple Store, for instance, were there to support Apple’s own Apple Store app, rather than to be made 
available to any developer who might be interested. 
 Many of  Gimbal’s early employees came out of Qualcomm’s app store business, a division that powered 
the app stores for over 60 wireless carriers long before Apple and Google’s app businesses cannibalized the 
highly lucrative trade of selling Solitaire and other simple games for feature phones. The BREW 7 business 
resembled closely what the beacon access network business could be when it comes of age. Qualcomm’s 
BREW platform offered app developers a dashboard of carriers covering territories around the world, whose 
app stores they could use to distribute their apps. The carriers could look at the catalog of apps and select 
those that were compatible with their service. Functionally, this resembled a Match.com dating service 
 5 Pulling yourself up by your bootstraps, or improving your situation by your own efforts, is a figure of speech used as 
early as the 1922 when James Joyce referenced it obliquely in his book  Ulysses . It was then adopted as a metaphor when 
describing the way that computers start up, with a sequence of small programs that invoke larger executables and 
higher-level functions, until the whole operating system is initialized, running and ready to do work. Since then, it has 
entered the business vernacular, with association to lean startups that build their businesses without borrowing large 
amounts of capital from venture capitalists.  
 6 “White Elephant: Something that requires a lot of care and money and that gives little profit or enjoyment.” – Merriam 
Webster Dictionary. White (Albino) elephants were said to be a status symbol for the kings of Siam (Thailand); they 
were rare and expensive. P.T. Barnham was said to have been very disappointed after spending lots of time and money to 
acquire a real white elephant for his circus. It turned out to be far from a crowd pleaser (maybe because it was actually 
grey and spotty). The resulting financial burden he suffered may account for the origin of the expression.  
 7 BREW stands for Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless. It included a set of cross-platform APIs that ran on 
phones as well as the app store platform that merchandised, sold, and delivered the apps over the air. An entire division 
(Qualcomm Internet Solutions) grew up to manage a huge ecosystem of BREW developers, wireless service providers, 
and the handset providers that were mandated to support the BREW APIs. If the parties at the BREW Developer 
Conference were anything to go by, it was a profitable business. One year, entertainment was provided by the Goo Goo 
Dolls on the deck of the USS Midway Aircraft Carrier moored in San Diego. The point being, these kinds of ecosystems 
can be lucrative.

between cellular networks and app vendors, a marketplace that could presage what the beacon access 
networks could become. In this future vision, the venue owners, rather than wireless carriers, make their 
beacons available to a market of app developers picking and choosing the locations they are interested in 
using to trigger their apps. 
 Gimbal doesn’t have a branded signature app like Shopkick or Piper (two beacon commerce networks). 
It has taken the route of partnering with app publishers such as major league baseball and OOH advertising 
via partners such as Titan, which sells billboard advertising space to brands 8 . 
 This broader focus has yielded an incredible set of wins, including the beacons at the South by 
Southwest festival, the Staples Center, every major sports league,  Elle magazine, and 500 double-decker 
buses conducting tours in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas, and Miami. The 
challenge has been converting one-off deals, where beacons are serving a single app, to achieving the full 
vision of an on demand, multi-tenant beacon infrastructure. That challenge may have been met in New York 
City, which we will look at next. 
 LinkNYC 
 An example of the Gimbal partnering to deploy a citywide beacon network is  LinkNYC , an ambitious 
deployment of free community high-speed Wi-Fi and cell phone charging stations rolling out across New 
York City. Link stations are taking the place of obsolete phone booths and are funded by the advertising 
displayed on the high-definition screens that are built into the futuristic stations (see Figure  13-17 ). 
 Figure 13-17.    One the first LinkNYC stations that are appearing around New York with beacons inside

CHAPTER 13 ■ UNDERSTANDING BEACON NETWORKS
234
 While Gimbal’s  beacons aren’t mentioned on the LinkNYC web site, they are part of the means to 
underwrite this resource. 
 Their beacons are being used in two ways. First, as an aid to contextualizing the out of home (OOH) 
advertising on the large displays built into the LinkNYC kiosks (as described in the chapter on OOH). 
Second, quite separate from the LinkNYC displays, the beacons can simply provide a more accurate location 
fix on New York street locations. This is particularly valuable, given they are situated in some of the most 
expensive real estate in the world that is blighted by the urban canyon effect, where the very skyscrapers that 
it is famous for render GPS ineffective. 
 Gimbal is then open to partner with makers of apps that have broad appeal, such as Shazam and 
RetailMeNot, and can then add value to those services by making those apps’ coupon offers relevant to the 
stores in the vicinity of the app, or their in-app advertising relevant to the cross street. Unlike a GPS fix, these 
more accurate location fixes can also come with metadata that describes the context around the beacon. For 
instance, the Gimbal Manager can include tags that list the shops nearby and the actual address of the cross 
street, rather than just a latitude/longitude coordinate.  
 Public Involvement 
 Titan and  Gimbal ’s previous attempt to deploy beacons was mired in controversy when the media jumped 
on the objections of privacy “hawks” who felt there wasn’t adequate disclosure of the presence of beacons. By 
comparison, the LinkNYC offering represents a much more equitable trade of valuable, free to use services, 
such as Internet browsing, phone charging, unlimited U.S. phone calls, and emergency services requests 
that are underwritten by the advertising and proximity services that beacons enable (see Figure  13-18 ). 
This initiative has been led by the mayor’s office, rather than having local government as a bystander, which 
provides a much more robust coalition to deal with objections from those who feel the presence of beacons is 
intrusive in the public thoroughfare.

236
 Since that first ill-fated experiment,  Titan has been merged into a larger company, Interscape, which 
is funded by Google, among others. The contract was awarded to CityBridge, which is a consortium that 
includes  Interscape and Qualcomm . 
 The Rollout 
 The deal is a 12-year franchise that will ultimately deploy 7,500  LinkNYC   kiosks across the five boroughs of 
the city. The kiosks will be linked by hundreds of miles of fiber optic cables and start with the installation 
of 510 gigabit links targeted for completion in mid-2016. 
 Other cities are building beacon networks, too. Piper, another San Diego based beacon company, has 
deployed hundreds of beacons around the stores and streets of Columbus, Georgia. On “the other side of 
the pond,” in Norwich, England, Proxama has deployed beacons in a UK government funded effort to use 
beacons to revitalize England’s “High Street” shops. Both of these efforts center on supporting a specific app 
that can then incorporate services for multiple advertisers, rather than a more general-purpose network. 
 Summarizing Beacon Access Networks and the LinkNYC  Project 
 Many of the early beacon networks are more specialized than a typical beacon access network. They have 
a specific use-case, or a smaller set of applications that the network supports. Beacon access networks, in 
contrast, are more open and support any use-case or application. In some ways, this represents a lower 
bar in terms of the engineering that is required. In other ways, this is a more challenging endeavor, as more 
beacons are required to support a broader set of use-cases. This broader focus can result in a longer path 
to revenue and a bigger challenge in terms of building momentum, since sustainable revenue only comes 
when a complete solution is in place. If all the vendor has to offer is a network of beacons, it is incumbent 
upon the network operator to find solution providers who can fill the gaps. Other, more complete, solutions 
can exercise control and offer a one-stop shop. 
 Gimbal’s LinkNYC project is distinctive because of the scale and value of the real estate they are 
covering, and because the APIs can be used in any beacon-enabled app, implementing any use-case. It’s a 
big bet with high risks, high rewards and a longer time to revenue than some of the other beacon networks 
that we will discuss next.  
 Beacon Commerce Networks 
 The last segment of beacon networks that we want to look at builds on the basic facilities of the beacon 
access network, and adds a more complete and focused solution stack. In the words of Geoffrey Moore, 
these companies have chosen a lead “pin” to focus on, rather than providing a solution to a broader set of 
applications. In some ways, this focused approach is a riskier bet. These companies need to build out more 
of the solution to meet a client’s requirements. And, as they do so, their addressable market gets smaller. 
What happens if they are focusing on the wrong pin? On the other hand, it allows them to sell a complete 
package to a business, and then push in a much more intense way to acquire a set of customers and partners 
relevant to that focus. 
 Rather than talking about beacons to a retailer, the sales teams can focus the conversation on 
“targeting,” “intent,” and “conversion,” speaking the language of the retailer. 
 We will look at some more examples to bring these abstract ideas to life. inMarket has focused on 
retail shopping apps and a beacon network to support them. Proxama, over in the United Kingdom, has an 
approach that ranges across a comprehensive set of OOH segments, transportation, and shopping apps. And 
lastly, Unacast has focused on ad retargeting. 

CHAPTER 13 ■ UNDERSTANDING BEACON NETWORKS
237
 inMarket 
 inMarket appears to have done something quite unusual: they have established what appears to be a 
financially sustainable beacon business, one that is supporting organic growth. This is a refreshing story 
to hear in a segment where many startups are highly leveraged with debt. By all accounts, their tight 
focus on retail and, in particular, grocery, has enabled them to avoid raising significant external capital, 
“bootstrapping” their way to a 50-person organization in five years, with APIs that are linked into 38 million 
installed apps, including app brands such as Epicurious, Zip List, Key Rings, ShopSavvy, List Ease, and 
CheckPoints, their own gamified 9 shopping app that predated the development of their beacon network. 
 See Figure  13-19 for examples of how different apps use beacons to engage users in a contextually 
relevant manner. 
  Figure 13-19.  The messages that Epicurious, CheckPoints, and List Ease can trigger using inMarket beacons 
when a shopper enters a store 
 9 Gamification is the introduction of game mechanics into applications that are not ordinarily considered to be games. 
Techniques include awarding points to encourage desired behaviors, awarding badges to associate status with certain 
desired actions, leader boards to instill a sense of competition, and progress bars to nudge people to complete a set of 
tasks.  
 

CHAPTER 13 ■ UNDERSTANDING BEACON NETWORKS

 By integrating with  inMarket, these apps benefit from beacon triggers that present alerts to consumers 
upon entry to stores and during the shopping process. These alerts support the functionality that motivated 
the consumer to download the app in the first place; for instance, searching for Epicurious recipes that may 
drive product choices in the store, collecting CheckPoints (points) in stores that support the program, and 
not forgetting shopping list items that have been stored away in List Ease. 
 This interplay between app, brand, and store is the driving force behind a successful beacon commerce 
network. This group of three, this triumvirate, all need to be present if any of them hope to succeed.  
 But not only do all three need to be present, they need to be aligned in their focus. For example, 
WebMD would be the perfect app for shoppers in a pharmacy with advertising coming from brands like 
Band-Aid. The Viggle entertainment app, on the other hand, would be a better choice for a movie studio to 
promote a new Blu-Ray disk in the DVD department of a Target store. To quote what sounds like a line from 
Monty Python 10 , “brought to you courtesy of the ministry of stating the bleeding obvious”. Yes, aligning store, 
app and brand seems, well, obvious. But how often are we bombarded with offers and messages that are out 
of context and irrelevant? If your experience matches mine, then more often than you would expect. 
 So the question stands, how do we integrate and motivate all three players to work toward the same goal? 
 The Motivation of the Triumvirate 
 The simple answer  is that everyone needs to have something to gain from working together. Barring out of 
the kindness of their hearts, the app developer has no reason to cooperate if only the store and brand are 
benefiting from the arrangement. The same could be said if the positions were switched. 
 10 No survival guide would be complete without a quote from Monty Python, so we borrowed this turn of phrase. 
However, despite numerous quotes in newspapers attributing the phrase “bleeding obvious” to that esteemed comedy 
troupe, during our routine fact check we searched the Python scripts and couldn’t find that expletive being paired with 
the word “obvious” anywhere. As it turns out, the phrase comes from John Cleese’s  Fawlty Towers, from the episode 
Basil the Rat “Can't we get you on Mastermind, Sybil? Next contestant: Mrs. Sybil Fawlty from Torquay. Specialist 
subject: the bleeding obvious.”

 Looking at each role, we will see that, when the interdependent nature of the relationship is understood, 
each member of the triumvirate will benefit most when they are all in accord (Figure  13-20 ). 
 Looking first at the app developer,  they get to share in the revenue from the brands that pay for in-app 
promotions triggered by proximity alerts within the store. Accordingly, the best way for the app developer to 
come out ahead is for the app to maximize visitors to the store, and to make it worth it for brands to pay for 
app-based promotions. In other words, they benefit most when the other members are also benefiting. This 
promise of a direct correlation between the enhanced functionality for the user and incremental revenue 
makes for a strong value proposition to app developers. 
 If inMarket’s network (and those like it) is a good deal for the app developer, what about the retailer? 
For them, the value proposition is strong, too. In Figure  13-21 , we get a sense of some useful insights into the 
engagements occurring in their stores that are being driven by inMarket’s network of apps. The patterns can 
easily be seen in the engagements being generated by state, day of the week and time of day. This should 
help reassure the retailer that they are not being disintermediated, which is one potential fear. In fact, 
 Figure 13-20.    The retail-focused beacon commerce network requires alignment of store, app, and brand       
 

CHAPTER 13 ■ UNDERSTANDING BEACON NETWORKS

the retailers approve each brand campaign before they are launched, as they would with a new endcap 11 
promotion. It also shows measurable results from the program. The campaigns may be driven by the brands 
whose products are being promoted, but the retailer is benefiting from the potential lift in sales of additional 
higher margin products, and benefiting from the loyalty of customers who are buying deeper into a broader 
range of products stocked by the merchant. 
 But what is the cost to the retailer of these insights, additional sales and loyalty? When the brand 
(Coca-Cola, Levi's, Nestle, and P&G, for example) is paying for the campaign, then there is no cost. Quite the 
opposite; there is a share of the revenue the brand is paying which flows through inMarket to the retailer.  
 Figure 13-21.  inMarket’s Retailer facing dashboard 
 11 An endcap is a display at the end of the aisle in the store. This is some of the most valuable space in the store. 
Traditionally, brands would pay in some way for access to this space. This payment may be in the form of cash payments, 
up to tens or hundreds of dollars per day per store, exclusive access to the product, or a lower wholesale price that yields 
larger profit margins.  
 

CHAPTER 13 ■ UNDERSTANDING BEACON NETWORKS
241
 What the retailer does pay for are the beacons themselves. In the same way that they pay for shelves or 
lighting, this makes sense. It also gives them ownership of the infrastructure to which they want to control 
access, and ownership for the success of the partnership. By buying the beacons, they “have some skin in the 
game”. inMarket takes care of the actual deployment of the beacons, which may be more expensive than the 
cost of the capital equipment.  
 As with the app developers, the retailer has a vested interest in the success of the other two partners, 
since all of their revenues are linked to at least some degree. 
 All that’s left is to ask why a product brand would be funding promotions that benefit the retailer, app 
developer, and inMarket. Their motive is clearly to sell more “product” and gain more market share from 
their competitors, but it goes beyond that. With this investment, they are getting a lot more insight into 
the effect of their promotional dollars than they normally would with investments in signage or coupons. 
Traditionally, the brand has no visibility as to who is responding to their promotions in the retailer’s store. 
As you can see from Figure  13-22 , now they get a precise readout of the  demographics  of the customer, 
including age and gender. 
 Figure 13-22.  inMarket’s product brand facing dashboard 
 

CHAPTER 13 ■ UNDERSTANDING BEACON NETWORKS
242
 It’s the brands, after all, that have the budget to invest in promotion. Where the retailer is operating on 
razor-thin margins, the manufacturer traditionally has a lot more margin to use to drive the promotion of 
their product. Their challenge is knowing how best to use those promotional dollars. As John Wanamaker, 
the 19 th -century inventor of the price tag, 12 said, “Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the 
trouble is I don't know  which  half.” 
 The Secret of Great Timing 
 Presenting promotional messages isn’t just about choosing the right place, it’s also about choosing the right 
time. Getting a promotion as you are leaving the store is more than a wasted opportunity, it degrades the 
credibility of the platform. By tracking the timing of visits to specific locations and understanding the nature 
of those locations (a delicatessen, for example), it’s possible to build a predictive model that can forecast 
when purchasing may happen. To this end, inMarket has introduced a function that it calls Quantum 
Receptivity that aims to predict and preempt patterns of shopping behavior, presenting promotional 
messaging just prior to the point of decision, at the right time and the right place. They report seeing an 
8% increase in store visits and a 14% increase in dollars spent per trip when enabling this feature. 
 The top product categories that drive this kind of proximity-triggered promotion are, as you might 
expect, deli items, over the counter medications, wines and sprits, non-alcoholic drinks and, lastly, snacks. 
 inMarket’s go-to-market approach is to focus on the brands and the creative agencies they use to create 
their campaigns. When selling to merchants, they can point out the reality of how tough it is for retailers to 
make their apps successful, whereas the apps that inMarket focuses on are already successful, work across 
retailers and have a strong affinity with millennial mothers, a highly valuable segment. inMarket reports that 
38% of the 9 million U.S. millennial mothers are already active users of beacon-enabled apps. 
 To secure the trust of the retailers, inMarket secures the access to their beacons to avoid other apps 
piggybacking and using the beacons without authorization. They also scan for other beacons that are not 
authorized by the retailer to be in the store. Given that beacons can be integrated into the cardboard displays 
provided with products by brands, this is a real possibility, and something that the retailer and inMarket will 
need to prevent in order to maintain control of their stores. 
 Bootstrapping the Network 
 It’s interesting to see how inMarket used its own CheckPoints app to prove the concept of triggers for a 
cross-retailer app working in retail stores. The idea of having your own app that can be used to “get the party 
going,” but to then recruit what might be seen as competing apps to start using your network on an equal 
footing, is a strategy that others are also using to get their businesses started (see the “Proxama” section that 
follows in this chapter). Convincing competitors that they should use your network and that you will be 
even-handed needs to be done carefully, though. 
 CheckPoints’ most direct competitor,  Shopkick , has also built out a very large set of Bluetooth beacons 
across retailers, but they have not moved in such a committed fashion to build the ecosystem of competing 
apps that use their network, despite signals that they are interested in moving in that direction. inMarket has 
decided that it is a network business with an app, and it is reaping the rewards. It will be interesting to see 
what Shopkick decides it wants to be going forward. 
 12 As a pioneer of the department store, Wanamaker’s price tags were part of a movement to setting fixed prices for 
products and helped curtail the practice of haggling over price.    www.pbs.org/wgbh/theymadeamerica/whomade/

CHAPTER 13 ■ UNDERSTANDING BEACON NETWORKS
243
 Proxama 
 While Gimbal, inMarket, Swirl, and others have been blazing their own trails toward beacon network 
Nirvana in the United States, parallel paths have been pursued in other countries. One of these is Proxama, 
which has made very credible progress across the United Kingdom. 
 Similar to Gimbal, they have partnered with OOH advertisers, are developing their own app, Loca, serve 
proximity triggered promotions for retailers, and targeting a range of locations from airports, taxis, and buses 
(see Figure  13-23 ) to convenience stores, shopping centers, stadia, and city centers. Unlike their American 
compatriots, however, they have chosen to partner with beacon OEMs rather than make their own hardware. 
Kontakt.io is their partner for this. Beneath their Loca app is a platform, called  TapPoint®  , which provides 
APIs for third-party apps to use in order to make sense of beacons and  perform  orchestration functions. 
 Doing This in Public 
 Unlike Gimbal and inMarket, Proxama is public, listed on the  Alternative Investment Market (AIM)  , owned 
by the London Stock Exchange, and set up to allow smaller companies to float shares. As a result, we have 
more visibility into their fortunes. The view of the beacon business it affords isn’t totally clear, though. 
Proxama actually has what is probably a larger business focused on next generation payments systems—
moving merchants from older magnetic stripe systems to the new wave of EMV (a chip-based payment card 
system) as well as a mobile payments system. The payment versus proximity marketing numbers are not 
broken out, but, as reading goes, it is more of a thriller than a soothing bedtime story. Proxama’s revenues 
have been growing, but their losses are still substantial.

244
 Proxama  are another “go big” play. Their modern offices on the edge of London impress visitors with 
Proxama’s confidence—confidence in their ability to pay what must be significant rent and a determination 
to be taken seriously in their sales efforts. 
 This “go big” approach has enabled them to win a one million pound grant from Innovate UK 
(a government agency) to use their proximity technology to pilot an approach to “reinvigorate the UK 
high street”. 
 Norwich 
 The first streets to be reinvigorated under this program were in Norwich, a city of 140,000 citizens and the 
largest in the county of Norfolk in the East of England (see Figure  13-24 to see an example of region-specific 
content in Proxama’s app). 
 Figure 13-24.  Proxama’s Loca app does more than push retailer offers; it promotes local events such as The 
Royal Norfolk Show and the Sandown horse races 
 Norwich may not be the best-known English town, but it has enjoyed its share of notoriety thanks 
to British playwright Alan Bennett and British comedian Steve Coogan. One of Bennett’s characters uses 
NORWICH as an acronym to signal to this wife his amorous intentions (look it up). Steve Coogan’s Alan 
Partridge alter ego is the most un-hip DJ in the UK, a big ABBA fan, and proudly claims Norwich as his 
home. The citizens of Norwich, rather than succumbing to embarrassment, have owned this uncomfortable 
affiliation and have erected a statue of Alan Partridge in their city center. 
 

CHAPTER 13 ■ UNDERSTANDING BEACON NETWORKS
245
 Norwich may seem a strange choice to target as a potential “smart city,” but the presence of the 
University of East Anglia means there is a good source of young smartphone users, along with the other folk, 
gathering in a contained area of manageable proportions that is the urban center in a beautiful agricultural 
landscape. 
 The Platform Beneath the Loca App 
 TapPoint , Proxama’s orchestration or mobile campaign management platform, originally used geofencing, 
QR codes, and passive NFC tags as triggers. Merchants like Harrods, Ladbrokes (betting shops), and Argos 
(catalog sales) and brands like Ralph Lauren all use it. The platform now supports both iBeacon and, 
for those who don’t have supported iBeacon apps on their phones, Eddystone URL protocols to enable 
consumers to access promoted content on the web. Within that, it performs frequency capping to regulate 
how many times a consumer receives a notification over a period of time. 
 Back to Norwich, beacons in shops trigger offers in the Loca app (see Figure  13-25 ). 
 Figure 13-25.  The Loca app serves up offers relevant to the user’s location; dummy bar codes are added to 
provide a redemption click that can then be measured within the app as a conversion indicator for analytics 
purposes; the PoS systems are not actually integrated with the system

 For a starting price of 35 pounds a month (roughly $50 U.S.), business owners can see a count of 
customers in the vicinity of the beacons (Figure  13-26 ), the number of notifications triggered, and the 
percentage of click-throughs from those notifications. Proxama reports a 25% conversion rate. 
 

CHAPTER 13 ■ UNDERSTANDING BEACON NETWORKS
247
 Merchants control campaigns from a  self-service web portal  .  
 Figure 13-27.    Screen for a merchant to set up a loyalty offer to be shown in Loca       
 

CHAPTER 13 ■ UNDERSTANDING BEACON NETWORKS
248
 Merchants use a variety of techniques to encourage their customers to use the Loca app, including 
“table tents,” which are cardboard displays that engage people when they are “dwelling” at tables; see 
Figure  13-28  for an example. 
 The input from the merchants in Norwich has directed development of the  Loca service   to go beyond 
promotions, to provide more useful information that will encourage visitors to stay in the town center. 
 Simple analytics—measuring redemption rates, dwell time, and return visits—were added to a retailer 
dashboard, along with loyalty features in the roadmap. Retailers were keen to support a campaign aimed at 
workers commuting into the city to “Head out, not home!” by promoting bars, restaurants, and free cultural 
events such as poetry readings and films that could help to keep shoppers in the town center. 
 Beyond Norwich 
 As well as operating in Norwich shops, Proxama has placed beacons on 110 buses that carry shoppers into 
the city center, driving a 30% click-through ratio within Loca. For this, they partner with OOH advertising 
sales partner Exterion to sell the “inventory” of ads, and potentially coordinate the in-app ads with 
traditional poster ads on the buses. This partnership was extended to London, where 500 beacons have 
been installed, with a potential reach of 300,000 passengers every day. Public transport represents a captive 
audience of people with a high penetration of smartphones (94%) and time on their hands, with between 
17 and 19 minutes for the average London journey. Another transportation option that is being targeted by 
Proama, and other entrepreneurs in other locations, is the taxi which has the same possibility of reaching 
someone with intent to spend, but likely with a greater disposable income (see Figure  13-29 ). 
 Figure 13-28.    A “table tent” sign promoting the Loca app in a Norwich cafe 
 

CHAPTER 13 ■ UNDERSTANDING BEACON NETWORKS
249
 Proxama has partnered with Eye Airports, the largest owner of UK airport advertising space, to deploy 
200 beacons across eight UK airports that handle 38 million passengers a year, including London Gatwick 
and Manchester International Airport. Eye Airport sells to advertisers such as duty-free concessions, brands, 
and airlines. 
 Other partnerships include  Red Kiosk , a company converting London’s iconic red phone boxes into 
tiny coffee stands and sandwich concessions, and Surrey County Cricket Club, which installed Proxama’s 
beacons at the Oval, Britain’s answer to Major League Baseball’s venues. Additionally, its push into the taxi 
market is forecast to scale up to 4,000 cabs. If someone can afford to pay for a cab, they have self-selected as 
being a potential shopper, bar, or restaurant patron with money to spend, a valuable advertising target.  
 Proxama Summary 
 Proxama  has been comprehensive in covering a breadth of different types of locations with its network and 
a broad set of OOH partners. Going forward, it needs to expand across more cities and more applications, 
using the positive metrics it has established in its pilot projects to scale the size of its network and achieve 
the volumes that will make the business achieve its potential.

 Unacast 
 Question: What could be bigger than a beacon network? Answer: A network built on other beacon networks. 
If the beacosystem were a series of Russian dolls, each a layer in the solution stack, then Unacast appears to 
aspire to be the last one wrapping up all the others. It’s an ambitious project with some exciting rewards. 
 Their approach to building a beacon network is to partner with multiple beacon manufacturers and 
other proximity solution providers, and in doing so build a network on top of their platforms. These partners 
include beacon OEMs, both large ones such as Estimote, Sensoro, and Signal 360, and more specialist 
providers such as Bubbly 13 . These partnerships extend beyond the hardware world and include vendors of 
pure software and service or orchestration layer products, such as Urban Airship, Smart Fission, and Pointr. 
All of these in the Unacast  vernacular  are called  proximity solution providers (PSPs)  . 
 The Value of the Network 
 Unacast’s value proposition is to provide additional functionality to what PSPs can offer their customers, and 
additional opportunities to monetize the solutions that the PSP are selling. They do this by brokering the 
proximity triggers that a PSP can drive, and the insights they unlock, to third parties. One of the main areas 
where these insights are used is in retargeting. 
 An example of a retargeting use-case is, when a shopper dwells for a few minutes in the TV department 
of an electronics store, that shopper might receive a promotion for televisions when they read  The New York 
Times on their laptop the following day. 
 13 Bubbly provides a self-service kiosk with a space-age design, plus beacon-enabled point of sale and vending. 
See    www.bubblygroup.com  . 

CHAPTER 13 ■ UNDERSTANDING BEACON NETWORKS
251
 The process and data flow within  Unacast’s Prox platform is illustrated in Figure  13-30 . Unacast can 
bring demand for a PSP’s beacons from ad platforms that the PSP otherwise might not have access to. On 
its own, a PSP is unlikely to have the scale needed to be a standalone ad platform in their own right. For 
advertisers, “size is important”. 
 While there are a number of companies using proximity triggers in third-party apps to measure 
intent 14  and enable attribution 15 , Unacast has succeeded in convincing them that it’s better to collaborate 
than compete. A parallel is in the cell phone network business, where carriers that compete for subscriber 
business, interconnect their networks in order to enhance the services that they can deliver to consumers 
(the ability to receive service when out of range of their network, for example) and to better use the capacity 
of their network as callers from other networks roam onto their system. 
 Challenges 
 One challenge when building a beacon network is that, in order for the interactions with the beacons to be 
useful, the beacons need to be tagged with metadata that describes the context of the beacon location, and the 
tagging used across those beacon networks needs to be reconciled. This metadata tagging includes the latitude 
 Figure 13-30.  Unacast’s Prox data flow 
 14 Intent to purchase can be measured with beacons by measuring dwell time at a certain kind of merchant or a department 
within a merchant’s store. Similar to our intent to buy a TV example, a particularly valuable example is intent to buy a 
car, which can be detected by beacons at a car show room. If an app user is seen spending time at car show rooms, they 
probably have intent to buy a car. Given the cost of cars, this is a lucrative use-case to focus on.  
 15 Attribution can be measured if an offer for a product at a store is presented to an app user and they then visit the store as 
measured by the beacon within an agreed period of time—36 hours, for example.  
 

CHAPTER 13 ■ UNDERSTANDING BEACON NETWORKS
252
and longitude of the beacon, the street address, the business at that address (Best Buy), what the business does 
(electronics retailer), the area within the building that the beacon is in (Television Department), the product 
the beacon is associated with and its brand (Panasonic TV) and, lastly (and optionally), a model number for 
items of larger value. 
 If you consider the range of the types of venues where a beacon might be located (cinemas, sports 
stadia, airports, restaurants, trade shows, theme parks, etc.), this metadata hierarchy can be quite intricate, 
and there is a subjective element as to how the hierarchy should be organized. Venues may have one 
opinion, and PSPs may have another. The brands that are advertising may see things differently, too. Then 
there is the reality that there may be missing data, misspelled terms and with different names used for the 
same thing. You say sweater, I say jumper, she says jersey, and he spells it jersie. This problem of making 
sure these tags all equate to the same thing, spelling mistakes and all, is challenging but solvable. Data 
warehousing consultants and librarians have been working on it for years, albeit in a different context. 
 To help with this, Unacast provides the PSP, which is a Sensor API, to integrate with their middleware 
to implement the tagging, and then a series of functions to clean and organize it. Their  Data Expander fills 
in gaps where tags are missing, using a contextual matching process that translates between synonyms. 
For example, their Relation Expander adjusts tags that are at the wrong level in a hierarchy, putting “yoga 
pants” under “sportswear” rather than beside it. Then these transformations are approved by the PSP with a 
workflow managed by the  Tag Feedback tool . 
 With a robust metadata system containing clean data, Prox then needs to translate to the form of 
metadata used by their partners, the brands and advertisers, and advertising networks. The Tag Translator 
does this. 
 Harmonizing metadata is non-trivial, and managing it well is a potential differentiator as this space 
becomes more competitive. 
 The Secret of Success 
 Success for  Unacast relies on meeting a number of challenges.
• 
 Recruiting PSPs —The value of the network is all about scale. With scale, advertisers 
can run the kinds of large campaigns that are relevant to a product’s success. 
Most advertisers want to hit all the larger  designated market areas (DMAs) with a 
campaign, not just one city. For PSPs, it’s like deciding which party to go to. Do you 
go to the small party where not many people are showing up, or to the one with lots 
of action? Unacast’s founders experience with building a music streaming service 
(TIDAL) has parallels with building this kind of ecosystem. It requires confidence. 
• 
 Recruiting brands and advertisers —These are the companies paying the additional 
money that makes the opportunity worthwhile for PSPs. This is probably the harder 
challenge, as PSPs can be recruited based on a vision. Brands and advertisers need 
the whole system to be working and see real “lift” from their use of the network. 
• 
 Efficiency and effectiveness —Integrating and organizing the network so that the 
parties come together efficiently, quickly and with a high quality of metadata 
integration. 
• 
 Managing the privacy issues —One person’s useful and well-targeted offer is another 
person’s intrusive, spooky irritation. Unacast has taken an ambitious step toward 
addressing this issue with  LocationControl.org , a service where consumers can 
see the data that PSPs are collecting and either request it to be erased, or correct any 
mistakes so they get more relevant content. 

CHAPTER 13 ■ UNDERSTANDING BEACON NETWORKS
253
• 
 Accelerating development of the ecosystem —Successful startups appear to be lucky 
with timing the market. Too early and you can lose momentum and run out of money. 
Arrive too late, and someone else steals the lead and erects barriers to entry. This is 
the central challenge of the beacosystem. There are some great opportunities, but 
it’s clear many startups are struggling to manage the balance between revenue and 
expenses over time. Unacast is impressive because of the scope of its ambition, the 
number of partnerships it is signing, and the way it seems to be making its own luck.  
 The Proxbook 16 initiative to make a marketplace where PSPs and brands can find each other through 
a directory of products and services is one example of the company going beyond the expected in creating 
a catalyst to speed the market chemistry. Location control is another example of what might be seen as an 
almost idealistic initiative, but one that also serves Unacast and its stakeholders well.  
 Bellwether of the  Beacosystem 
 In some ecosystems, there are companies that can still be successful even if their customers fail. Cisco is a classic 
example. During the Internet bubble, many of Cisco’s customers bought millions of dollars of Cisco routers and 
then failed. Despite that, Cisco still did very well. ADP, the payroll company, is an example of a company whose 
fortunes are directly tied to the success of the economy. When job numbers go up, ADP does well. Economists 
can look at how ADP is doing and see an indicator of what to expect for the U.S. economy as a whole. 
 In Unacast’s role as a network of beacon networks, its success is of special interest to those of us vested 
in the future of the beacosystem. It’s hard for Unacast to be successful if there are fundamental issues in the 
proximity ecosystem. Their success depends on value flowing through the whole beacosystem value chain. If 
things go well with the industry, they are very well placed. In this way, they are for the beacons what ADP is 
to the broader economy, a key bellwether to be watched closely. 
 Summary 
 We have made the case that beacon networks are of strategic importance to the development of the 
beacosystem. While vendors tend to use the word “network” to describe any beacons they have deployed, 
the key from our perspective is that those beacons need to be joined up and made accessible to multiple 
applications. It’s only then that costs are shared and reduced and new ideas can be developed quickly, using 
existing beacons that are already in place. Likewise, when multiple apps share the same beacons, there is more 
money flowing through to the beacon and venue owner, and so supply of this key infrastructure increases. 
 We have seen lots of examples in this chapter of where the spread of networks is starting to happen, be 
it in our airports, in the streets of New York city, or the shops in the United States or the United Kingdom. 
As beacon networks grow, the opportunities of joining them up and linking the advertising networks in the 
digital and physical worlds grows too. 
 While there are plenty of alternative proximity technologies, very few are being networked in the way 
beacons are. We are not seeing Wi-Fi proximity networks springing up (except within maps products). There is 
no reason why this shouldn’t happen, but, for now, it’s the beacosystem that is driving this network movement. 
The exciting thing is that beacons that are standalone today can be added to a network fairly quickly. A skeptical 
retailer may look at others in the mall that are making money by opening up their beacons to other apps and 
decide to join in. When this happens, they can enable new apps and provide benefits to their customers beyond 
those that were originally envisaged for the “monogamous” beacons supporting only the retailer’s app. 
 In the next chapter we are going to look at programmatic advertising and OOH advertising businesses 
with a view to understanding how these amazing economic engines fuel the revenue streams that can grow 
beacon networks.

 CHAPTER 14  
 A Programmatic Advertising 
Primer 
 A frequent question from investors in proximity solution providers is “how do we make money?” 
Advertising revenue is one of the most frequent answers. Internet advertising is a $49 billion 1 market. It has 
fueled the development of the search and mapping services we all depend on. We are all Internet advertising 
experts, in that we are on the receiving end of banner ads, videos, search ads, boosted social media posts, 
 Anke Audenaert, CEO Favrit and Adjunct Professor, Anderson School of Management, UCLA

256
and sponsored content in our apps and browsers, but in order to design a solution or build a business 
plan that taps into this revenue, it’s necessary to know more. As Internet advertising continues to grow and 
become more sophisticated,  programmatic advertising (the automated buying and selling of advertising in 
real time) is becoming increasingly important component of the Internet advertising market, accounting for 
20% of the total and nearly half of the display-advertising segment. Given the sophistication and complexity 
of the targeting possible with proximity solutions, the programmatic approach is likely to become even more 
important. While the pilot projects are small in number, proximity advertising can be done using manual 
processes, but this is surely a transitional approach that will lead to a more automated future. 
 As a technologist looking at the proximity market, I became conscious of our own ignorance of the 
world of advertising. When Anke Audenaert invited me to present a lecture on beacon technology to her 
MBA class, I sat in on her lecture on programmatic advertising. The synergy between our subjects was 
obvious and so was Anke’s experience and clarity. So it’s a great pleasure to have her write this chapter to 
augment our survival guide for the proximity solution provider.

 Some History 
 Starting   with its debut as the Wired.com Banner in 1994 2 , display advertising emerged as a powerful way to 
monetize digital content, powering the growth of native Internet giants like Yahoo! and AOL, and subsidizing 
the digital presence of traditional media like  The New York Times,  Conde Nast Magazines, and countless 
others. By 2001, display advertising had grown to a billion dollar industry in the United States alone. 
 In the early 2000s we saw some seismic shifts in the Internet landscape. On the one hand, content 
production costs dropped, which in combination with easier content-creation tools made digital publishing 
accessible to the masses. On the other hand, Google had emerged and made search the default way to access 
the web’s information, allowing anyone’s content to be found, whether you published under a recognizable 
brand name or just on your own blog. A long tail of web sites were started as a result, opening an infinite 
supply of digital content, and with it, an almost infinite supply of display advertising space. 
 Leading up to the emergence of the long tail, most digital display advertising had been bought and sold 
following the same media buying principles used in traditional media, where buyers and sellers connect 
and agree on where and when a campaign would run. The campaigns would be executed through the 
publisher’s ad server, using an “insertion order,” making the ads appear alongside the content the buyer had 
selected. But, now that the supply of advertising space had exploded, traditional deal-making did not fill all 
the available advertising space. Smaller publishers had accessible content, but they did not have the sales 
teams to sell the space directly to advertisers. A vast amount of “remnant inventory” went unsold. That is 
when  ad networks  emerged. They bought up the remnant space from large and small publishers for cents 
on the dollar and made it their business to package it in ways that would make the inventory attractive to 
advertisers. At the core of their packaging approach was the target audience. Ad networks bundle together 
inventory based on who will typically access the content associated with it. Advertisers can then work with 
the ad networks to buy advertising space alongside content that is appealing to different demographic 
groups—women, youth, and so on. The approach these ad networks took to audience targeting was 
relatively crude and lacked transparency. As a result, the prices of the remnant inventory remained low and 
the publishing community started to fear that this would also drive down the price of what they considered 
their “premium advertising space,” the inventory they sold directly. 
 Around 2006,  advertising exchanges emerged. Ad exchanges bring together the publishers and advertisers 
to allow the sale of advertising inventory on a one-by-one basis, promising to increase transparency and 
control for both players. This gave birth to what we now refer to  as    programmatic advertising and the ad 
tech landscape. While the ad exchanges are at the center of the ecosystem, the landscape now also includes 
intermediaries that facilitate the sale on both the advertisers’ and the publishers’ sides.

 Data As the Core Building Block for Programmatic 
Advertising 
 Before taking a closer look at the advertising technology landscape, it is important to shed more light on 
what powers most of the programmatic advertising transactions;  user data . 
 Any advertising professional will tell you that one of the most important factors in a campaign’s success 
is its ability to reach its target audience. It starts with defining that audience as granularly as possible and 
then getting the campaign in front of these people through the media they use, while minimizing “waste”—
ads shown to people outside the target. Traditional media allow for targeting using general demographics 
like age, gender, and so on. Publishers monitor who their content (such as TV shows) typically appeals to 
and that information is used in the media buy. However, the traditional descriptive targeting mechanisms 
are crude and associated with a lot of waste. That is where digital media differs. As people navigate the web 
or apps, their behavior can be monitored, and the data that results from that help to build up a much more 
granular profile of the audience consuming the content. 
 It All Starts with a Cookie 
 Consider web browsing. Every time a user accesses a web site, a tiny text file gets stored in the user’s browser. This 
text file, referred to as a  cookie , 3 is unique to the web site and allows the publisher to keep track of users during 
their visit and to recognize the users on subsequent visits. These cookies were designed to make the browsing 
experience smooth but they also serve an important purpose in targeting advertising. There are different types of 
cookies; depending on who controls the cookie, we refer to them as first-party or third-party cookies. First-party 
cookies are set by the publisher of the web site you visit. The publisher stores the cookies and, through the terms 
of use, has an implicit contract with the user of the site that determines what the cookies are used for. 
 Third-party cookies are set by an entity different from the publisher of the web site you are visiting, 
hence, a third party. There is no direct agreement between the third party and the user, but the web site 
publisher has agreed to let the third party store a cookie in the browser of its users. Third-party cookies are 
primarily set for advertising targeting purposes. The companies that set these cookies have agreements 
with a large number of web sites. This allows them to build a profile of users (cookies) by monitoring the 
browsing behavior across all these web sites based on the unique text files they store in the users’ browsers. 
They then use this behavioral tracking information to segment users in descriptive categories that could 
appeal to advertisers for targeting purposes. 
 These categories are based on the online behavior of a user. For example if a user is browsing around 
on car review sites and comparing car models, the user may be classified as “an auto intender”. Or, if a user is 
checking out parenting advice sites or buying baby gear online, the user may fit the “new parent” category. 
The users’ personal information is not stored in these categories or segments; instead, a copy of the 
cookies that were saved in the users’ browsers is used as an identifier for users and the different segments 
they belong to. Next, when users are browsing around online, advertisers will use the cookies in the users’ 
browsers to match them to these segments, allowing them to target the users with meaningful ads. 
 Data in the form of cookies have become core to the advertising landscape. Advertisers use the cookies 
as proxies to define their target audience. Cookies stored in users’ browsers allow them to find their exact 
targets. Advertisers can target their campaigns to segments of users that have shown a certain behavior, 
but they can also advertise to people that have visited their web sites before, in a practice that is called 
 re-targeting . Cookies that are set during the user’s visit (e.g., when the user is putting products in a shopping 
cart) can be used to find those users again when they are visiting other web sites. Ads to encourage users to 
come back (and check out those shoes) are shown to the users. 
 These granular behavioral targeted campaigns have proven to be effective, and as a result, data has 
become more valuable than ever to advertisers and publishers alike.

 But Cookies Are Not Enough 
 While cookies are a powerful way to monitor a user’s behavior on the web, they have many shortcomings. 
Pushed by consumers’ increasing concerns around privacy, some browsers are blocking third-party cookies 
and some users will install tools that limit the storing of cookies in their browsers. An even more important 
concern for cookie-based advertising is the fact that an increasing proportion of browsing happens on 
mobile browsers, most of which do not accept cookies and don’t allow storage of cookies. Due to these 
limitations, other means to monitor behavior are emerging.  Device IDs   and specific mobile advertising IDs 
have been introduced to allow the connection of online behavior on mobile devices to a unique user. On 
top of that, companies that work on mapping identification across devices have emerged, in order to allow 
advertisers to track and target people across different screens. 
 Complex as the data landscape may seem, it is clear that understanding users and their online behavior 
is key to executing targeted campaigns. The value of data as a currency will keep increasing, and publishers 
that can offer the most reliable profile of their users across screens will be in a position to reap the benefits.  
 The Basic Underlying Principle in Programmatic Advertising 
 Programmatic advertising 4  refers to all advertising campaigns that are executed without the interference of a 
human to make the advertising insertion or to optimize the placement. 
 In order for machines to execute an advertising insertion, the buyers and the sellers agree on the 
placements they are targeting. Aside from size and format of the placement, sellers describe the ad space in 
two ways:
• 
  A description based on the context that surrounds the placement (for example, 
women’s fashion, celebrity news, and so on) 
• 
 Details about the visitor who will be exposed to the placement (for example, a visitor 
who is interested in buying a new car; a visitor who just had a baby, and so on)    
 The way the machines pass this information back and forth is mostly in the form of cookies, the text files 
that are stored in the users’ browsers. On mobile devices, where a lot of the user time is spent on apps rather 
than in a browser, information about the user is passed on via the advertising ID. This is a built-in feature of 
the operating systems of the phones (e.g., Android and iOS). App developers can access this advertising ID, 
which is a unique identifier for a user. They can then link the behavior of a user to that advertising ID, which 
makes it possible for advertisers to target users with desired behavioral patterns. Cookies and Advertiser IDs 
all serve as proxies for the user in the targeted advertising transaction. 
 Another important aspect of programmatic advertising is the fact that the placement of the ad happens 
in real time and is unique to the combination of the context and the visitor who is on the site at that moment. 
As such, individual impressions are traded one by one.

CHAPTER 14 ■ A PROGRAMMATIC ADVERTISING PRIMER
259
 You can basically think of every visitor online as carrying around a passport filled with data that provides 
details about that user and his/her online behavior. All the first- and third-party cookies are contained in 
this passport, as is the user’s mobile device ID, the mobile advertiser IDs, the Facebook ID, and so on. Then, 
when the user visits a site, the content of that site loads and simultaneously a call is made to the ad server. 
The publisher will pass on info about the context for the ad as well as all the info it has about that user—all the 
info in the user’s passport. Advertisers will evaluate that information to see whether they recognize any piece 
of info associated with that user as an indication that the user falls within their target group. If the advertiser 
decides that he is interested in the placement, he may buy it and the ad server will send back the ad that 
specifically targets that user. The user thus sees an ad that is uniquely selected for him/her. 
 Behind the scenes, there is a lot more going on. When the web site calls the ad server to evaluate what 
ad to show the user, a whole set of actions happen in real time. It involves different players, who are all part 
of the  ad tech landscape .

While visiting different web sites, the sites place first- and third-party cookies on the user’s browser. If the 
user is on a mobile device, additional data is collected by the sites about the visitor’s device, its related 
advertiser ID, and often its location. 
 

CHAPTER 14 ■ A PROGRAMMATIC ADVERTISING PRIMER

 Central to this landscape is the  advertising exchange 5 . This is basically the marketplace where the buyers 
and sellers meet and decide on what ad to serve at which price. 
 Technology behind the scenes makes a sales transaction possible, but it also makes the buying and 
selling of ads more complex for traditional advertisers and to some extent for publishers. Because of the 
technology involved, quite a few intermediaries emerged to lend a helping hand. 
 The advertisers will typically work through their agencies’ trading desks and  demand-side platforms 6 , 
which will help them buy the right advertising space for the best possible price and that will plug them into 
the advertising exchanges. 
 The publishers on the other hand will enlist the help of a  supply-side platform 7 to ensure that the 
advertising space they have to offer is filled in with ads that will generate the highest yield. These supply-side 
platforms will connect to the advertising exchange on the publishers’ behalf. 
 Both advertisers and publishers rely on data management platforms, which help them store, analyze, 
and connect data to enable the advertising targeting. 
 Programmatic advertising is relatively young, and the technology is evolving quickly. Different 
companies focus on different aspects of the technology and different parts of the advertising transaction. 
The resulting advertising technology landscape is complex and cluttered with many small companies, vying 
for a piece of the action. A few larger players have emerged over the past few years, and some incumbents 
have acquired smaller companies to strengthen their technology stack.

 The following sections describe the role of each of these players in a bit more detail, starting with the 
central player, the ad exchange. 
 The Advertising Exchange 
 In programmatic advertising, the  advertising exchange is where the actual deals happen. While deals 
in traditional advertising involved a large number of impressions traded at a negotiated price, in the ad 
exchange, the deals involve individual impressions. Buyers bid for the impressions in an auction format. 
Most exchanges operate as second-price auctions, meaning that the highest bidder will win the impression 
and thus the opportunity to show its ad, at a price that is a fraction higher than the second (lower) bid. 
Exchanges handle millions of impressions, running auctions for each one of them, and they do so in real 
time. Hence, people often refer to programmatic advertising as RTB (Real-Time  Bidding ) advertising. 
 While the transaction is one between an advertiser and a publisher, intermediaries typically manage 
the execution. The demand-side platforms are the ones that have “seats” on the exchanges, and they bid on 
behalf of the advertisers or their trading desks. The publishers will work via their supply-side platforms, who 
will set up the technology inside a publishers’ ad server to ensure inventory can be presented for auction in 
the exchange. 
 A piece of inventory presented in an auction takes the format of a standardized description of that 
inventory. It informs potential bidders on the format and size of the ad space and the content surrounding 
the ad. It also provides info on the person who will be seeing the ad (the person currently visiting the web 
page where the ad will be shown). All cookies picked up in the users’ browser will be attached here. And, 
if the user is on a mobile device, the device ID, mobile advertising ID, and potentially the location of the 
user will be passed on as well. The richer the information that can be attached to the piece of inventory, 
the higher the chances that the inventory is appealing to an advertiser. The publishers will also add a “price 
floor” to their inventory, which is a minimum price under which the ad space is not sold. Note that prices in 
the advertising exchanges are typically CPM-based (cost per thousand impressions). 
 The demand-side platforms know which cookies, types of users, and formats of inventory they are 
looking for and what they want to pay for them. When the inventory matches their desired targets, they 
will execute a bid. If they win the bid and the bid exceeds the publisher’s floor price, the ad server of their 
advertiser gets to fill in the ad space with their ad. 

CHAPTER 14 ■ A PROGRAMMATIC ADVERTISING PRIMER
262
 The  Demand-Side Platform (DSP) 
 A  demand-side platform provides software that enables advertisers to buy inventory in advertising 
exchanges. DSP’s promise to the advertiser is that they will find the inventory the advertiser is looking for 
at the best available price. DSPs are in theory vendor neutral, so they provide a way for advertisers to buy 
inventory across different publishers, without having to make individual deals with all of these publishers. 
Because this allows advertisers to evaluate a very large amount of inventory (billions of impressions daily), 
they can execute increasingly targeted buys, which require large populations in order to match the 
target group. 
 Advertisers provide their DSP with their targeting criteria (the inventory they are interested in) as well 
as their frequency capping and pricing goals. The DSPs will translate these targeting criteria in inventory 
descriptions—for example, which cookies, IDs, and so on, align with the advertiser’s target. Often, the DSPs 
will rely on data management platforms to make that translation. In some cases, such as in the case of 
re-targeting, the advertiser will provide the exact list of cookies they are trying to target (such as the list of 
cookies for users who have visited the advertiser’s site in the past). 
 DSPs have their own proprietary algorithms that help them execute efficient buys (buying the desired 
inventory at the lowest price possible). They provide performance reports to the advertisers and they will 
optimize their campaigns as they progress. DSPs charge a transaction fee for the inventory they trade.  
 Supply-Side Platforms (SSP) 
 Publishers  use   supply-side platforms (SSPs) to sell their inventory programmatically. The SSP provides 
software that connects the publishers’ inventory to different ad exchanges and ad networks where there is 
demand from advertisers. The software passes on the specifics of the available advertising space, along with 
the information on the context and the user who will see the ad. The SSP optimizes the way the ad space 
gets filled for maximum yield. It will work inside the publishers’ ad server to route the inventory to where it 
believes it can garner the highest price. It considers the advertising exchange as one of the options, but it will 
also consider other ways the ad space may get sold, such as through a pre-negotiated price in a direct sale or 
by an advertising network. It will put all of the options in the mix and use its proprietary algorithms to send 
the ad request to where it estimates it will get the highest price. 
 The SSP software tackles a process that used to be manual, where publishers would work with insertion 
orders that were scheduled by their advertising operations department. These insertion orders where 
programmed in bulk, with little option to optimize during the campaign. The SSPs automate this scheduling 
and yield optimization job, while helping publishers access a much larger demand for their inventory than 
what they could achieve through direct deals. 
 Data Management Platforms (DMP) 
 Data  plays a pivotal role in advertising technology, especially data that describes online users. Data management 
platforms concentrate on storing all that data and categorizing, analyzing, and segmenting the data. 
 DMPs are used by the advertisers to help them construct the profiles for their targets. The DMPs 
have their proprietary ways to segment or categorize users based on their online behavior and the cookies 
associated with that behavior, and the advertisers can tap into those segments. Based on the cookies and IDs 
saved for the users in a segment or category, the advertisers can then buy advertising targeted at the user 
associated with those cookies/IDs. 
 Publishers also use the DMPs, as they like to enhance the data that they have on their site’s or app’s 
users. The more information the publisher can offer the advertiser to describe its visitors, the higher the 
probability that advertisers are interested in that user, and the higher the price the publisher will get for the 
ad impressions served to that user. 

CHAPTER 14 ■ A PROGRAMMATIC ADVERTISING PRIMER
263
 Data storage and management is complex, especially when handling massive data sets and when using 
the information to connect to real-time technologies. DMPs specialize in exactly that, making the life of the 
advertisers and publishers easier. 
 What Is Next? 
 The advertising technology industry is still young and has seen considerable change while growing up. Some 
interesting trends that are further shaping programmatic advertising include:
• 
 Increasing inclusion of premium advertising inventory 
• 
 A shift to people-based targeting across multiple devices 
• 
 An interest in programmatic advertising outside of just the digital 
screens—especially TV and brick and mortar  
• 
 The use of beacons to enhance targeting 
 Premium Advertising Inventory 
 While programmatic advertising originally focused on just the “remnant”  inventory , it was soon recognized 
to create efficiencies that could benefit some of the traditional transactions. A more efficient execution and 
optimization of advertising insertion and its ability to open the inventory to much larger demand makes 
programmatic advertising appealing to fill advertising space that would previously have been reserved for 
direct deals between publishers and advertisers. While direct deal making is not going away, the execution of 
the advertising campaign now often happens automatically, and people will refer to that as “programmatic 
premium”. We also see private marketplaces emerge, where publishers open their premium advertising 
space to a select group of bidders, using the programmatic buying principles. As publishers keep seeking 
ways to optimize their yield and advertisers are eager to streamline their media buys, it is believed that soon, 
all display advertising execution will fall under the programmatic advertising umbrella.  
 People-Based Targeting Across Multiple Devices 
 With  an  ever-increasing amount of media consumed on mobile devices, advertisers are spending an 
ever-larger part of their budget on advertising in mobile browsers and apps. In order to control who sees the 
ads, it is important for advertisers to be able to find their targets across devices. While a cookie can be a good 
proxy to find a user on the desktop, cookies don’t translate well to mobile devices. Apps don’t work with 
cookies, and many mobile browsers block the setting of cookies. As a result, many players in the industry 
are working on alternatives for the cookie. Facebook and Google are both trying to define new standards to 
identify users across screens with unique user IDs. We will see those IDs gain in importance over time and 
we will see an increased focus on data that can serve as a better identifier for people than the cookies we rely 
on today.  
 Programmatic Advertising Outside of Just the Digital Screens 
 While  digital  media offers a vast advertising opportunity, a lot of money is still spent on advertising in other 
media environments, television being the frontrunner. The TV landscape and its technology are evolving, 
and many of the programmatic advertising players see the connected TVs as their next frontier. And, 
although ecommerce is flourishing, many purchases still happen offline. Marketers have always had an 
interest in opportunities to influence consumers right at the point of purchase. 

CHAPTER 14 ■ A PROGRAMMATIC ADVERTISING PRIMER
264
 The Use of Beacons to Enhance Targeting 
 The emergence of  beacon technology allows tracking in-store behavior, which, combined with ubiquitous 
mobile devices, enables advertisers to put promotions in front of users based on their specific in-store 
location. Interactions between mobile devices and beacons are personal in nature, and the programmatic 
advertising model can then be extended to include these new ways to promote products and reach 
consumers in a brick and mortar environment.
 Anke Audenaert 
 Summary 
 Now we have a clear picture of programmatic advertising, let’s consider how beacons could augment that 
ecosystem. 
 Beacons can provide a much more precise level of targeting that supply-side platforms could use to 
increase the value of the inventory they are managing. For example, ads targeted at people who are in the 
proximity of a certain category of retail display, such refrigerators. If a user were standing in the white-goods 
section of Best Buy, ads for refrigerators could appear within their game of Tetris, a mobile web site, or 
shopping list app. 
 The targeting could also include factors such as dwell time. If an individual dwells for longer than five 
minutes in the vicinity of a display of refrigerators, an ad that appeared in the media they were browsing on 
their phone might be more valuable to a manufacturer of refrigerators. To capture this value, the advertising 
exchange might work with a supply-side platform to raise the premium for inventory that matches a 
demand-side platform’s targeting of such consumers. 
 These location triggers would certainly make the inventory that the supply-side platform is managing 
more valuable, which is to the benefit of the publisher, but the owner of the beacon and the venue that 
the beacon sits in will want to be adequately compensated too. This will require another party, potentially 
the data platform, to source the location trigger and broker the compensation to the beacon owner. The 
beacon owner will then need to compensate the venue owner that permitted the beacon to be put in place. 
Demand-side platforms need to be able to present these new dimensions of targeting to advertisers. In 
addition to the examples of location triggers, a valuable set of attributes could be associated with a device ID. 
If that ID has been seen at high-value locations such as car show rooms, luxury goods merchants, or a high 
stakes table at a casino, its value becomes enhanced. 
 There is then the possibility to cross-pollinate the value of the device with the value of yet another 
location. Establishing premium value to a beacon in a high-stakes location within a casino and enhancing 
the value of device IDs that visit that location is a fairly obvious move. If there is a correlation between device 
IDs that visit that part of a casino and ones that frequently visit a late night diner in a low-rent neighborhood, 
we can start to make less obvious inferences about the value of the beacon in the diner too. In this example, 
we could automatically infer that the diner has a hidden value as a late night hangout for high-rolling 
gamblers. 
 Such changes to the programmatic advertising platforms are unlikely to happen in the early days of the 
beacosystem. These changes are complex and both the value and volume need to be established before all 
the players will adopt. Until beacon networks become broadly available across multiple markets, it doesn’t 
make sense for the programmatic advertising platforms to change what they do. 
 One-stop platforms that incorporate all the elements discussed in this chapter into a single simplified 
system, such as inMarket and Swirl, are pioneering the use of beacons for advertising. As they establish 
they can drive lift in the value of their advertising inventory and there is enough volume, the programmatic 
advertising platforms will change too. When that happens, the market has the potential to grow rapidly.

 Out-of-home advertising is one of the first applications for Bluetooth beacons where beacons have been 
deployed at significant scale. We have seen many hundreds of beacons deployed across major U.S. cities, 
attached to phone booths and other street furniture. These deployments have been the first instances of the

beacon network, a set of beacons made available to multiple apps. Beacon networks are likely to be a key 
part of the development of the beacosystem. They allow beacon-enabled apps to be created and deployed 
at scale much more economically and rapidly than if beacons had to be purchased and put in place for each 
new app deployed. 
 Advertising has provided the life-blood of many forms of media, enabling the production of television, 
magazines, newspaper, music, video, web sites, and mobile apps that wouldn’t otherwise exist. Out-of-home 
(OOH) advertising is one of the first segments of that larger advertising market where beacons have proven 
their value. 
 For these reasons, a closer look at OOH is an important part of this guide to the beacosystem.
   This chapter is a revised version of a whitepaper entitled “Watch this Space” published by 
immr for Gimbal Inc. 
 Steve Statler 
 Introduction 
 Out-of-home (OOH) media are ubiquitous, surrounding us on street corners, roadsides, and in transit, 
venues, and many other locations. In the United States alone, OOH advertising represents a $7+ billion 
industry and is projected to grow to more than $8 billion over the next five years (see Figure  15-1 ). As 
beacons are deployed across verticals, the environments in which consumers shop, work, and play 1 are 
becoming “beaconized 2 ”. The combination of mobile, OOH, and beacons—called  MOHBE 3 —represents a 
unique opportunity for advertisers, OOH media, and mobile partners.

 Beacons are already being integrated into a wide range of OOH media, in airports, transit (subway 
stations, bus shelters, trains, and buses), kiosks, and other “street furniture,” and other locations. With 
 MOHBE  , businesses are engaging consumers with timely, relevant, and even personalized ads, messages, 
and offers. In addition to enhancing consumers’ experience, MOHBE allows advertisers to target audiences 
with greater precision, to capture richer data, and to better measure their results.
 “Over the last twelve months iBeacons/BLE beacons have caught the zeitgeist and emerged 
as a key anchor technology in the retail space. However, there are many other markets 
that will generate even bigger volumes of BLE beacon shipments over the next five years, 
creating a 60 million unit market in 2019.”

 Outlining the significance of  MOHBE for advertisers, mobile app publishers, and OOH media 
properties, this chapter discusses the following topics:
• 
 Features that distinguish OOH media 
• 
 Beacons and platforms 
• 
 How mobile, beacons, and OOH are being integrated

 OOH Media Overview 
 National, regional, and local businesses across a wide range of product and service categories rely on OOH 
to reach consumers. OOH’s popularity is due to its reach, visibility, dwell time, and other features shown in

 Seven Features Distinguishing OOH Media 
 Reach —With hundreds of thousands of displays in malls, airports, bus shelters, billboards, buses, and 
subways, OOH reaches pedestrians, commuters, and drivers wherever they go 5 . 
 Visibility  —Positioned squarely in consumers’ line of sight, OOH’s visibility delivers frequent exposure. 
Combined with colorful graphics and clever, creative ads, OOH is likely to get noticed, remembered, and 
acted upon (see Figure  15-3 ). Digital OOH (DOOH) enhances visibility even more.

CHAPTER 15 ■ UNDERSTANDING THE INTEGRATION OF MOBILE, BEACONS, AND OUT-OF-HOME MEDIA 
269
 Targeting  —OOH audiences can be targeted based on their location, interests, demographics, and, with 
DOOH, time of day. By targeting festivals, business openings, and other areas with concentrated, hyper-local 
audiences, mobile billboards 6 also bring speed, flexibility, and a high degree of accuracy to OOH. 
 Dwell Time  —On-transit media (e.g., subways, buses, taxis, and airplanes), in doctor’s offices, and 
even at intersections, dwell time can range from a minute to a half hour or more. Since dwell time is often 
relatively free of distractions, OOH messages and creative that match audience interests and context deliver 
high recall.

CHAPTER 15 ■ UNDERSTANDING THE INTEGRATION OF MOBILE, BEACONS, AND OUT-OF-HOME MEDIA  
270
 Path-to-Purchase —Many OOH media are on or near consumers’  path to purchase —for CPG, near 
grocery stores; for OTC medications, near pharmacies; for autos, near dealers; and so on. Since consumers 
often decide on purchases at or near the point-of-purchase, OOH ads can significantly   influence  consumers’ 
consideration and choice of products and brands. 
 Engaging  —In many cases, OOH must capture the consumer’s attention and convey a message quickly. 
To satisfy these requirements, creatives do some of their best   work  in OOH, using novelty, surprise, humor, 
and other elements. 
 Utility —Consumers value OOH ads that contain information they can use, such as new products and 
services or nearby points-of-interest and activities. Even leading tech companies recognize the value of reaching 
consumers on the go via OOH. For example, a recent   Google Outside  campaign took over some 150 DOOH 
displays in London to showcase the Google Search app for iOS and speech-recognition capabilities.  
 Beacons and OOH Locations 
 Beacons are being deployed in many locations where OOH media are present, from shopping malls and 
airports to transit, attractions, restaurants, bars, and many others. 
 Shopping Malls —When entering   malls with beacons  , consumers with shopping apps such as 
  RetailMeNot   are receiving push notifications highlighting special offers at participating merchants, 
specials in the food court, schedules of events, invitations to enroll in the mall’s loyalty program, and more. 
  Mobiquity Networks  ’ mall-based ad network is in 236 malls reaching 37,000 storefronts; PlaceWise Media is 
  integrating  beacons into its solutions for some 700 shopping destinations. 
 Airports —In   Orlando  ,   London  ,  Hong Kong  , and other major  airports , beacons are being deployed 
to guide travelers, show where luggage can be picked up and dropped off, and present offers for food and 
beverages, travel accessories, and other products and services.   Proxama  and   Eye Airports  are   deploying  200 
beacons across eight London airports, including London Gatwick, delivering targeted content, offers, and 
rewards to 100 million passengers. MOHBE in airports brings utility for travelers and value to advertisers 
targeting this high-value segment. 
 Transit —In   subway stations  in Boston and other cities, beacons integrated with the  transit authority’s 
app or a third-party app are providing directions to the correct platform, showing arrival and departure 
times, and, in some cases, presenting ads and offers from businesses. In Australia, Adshel is   rolling out  more 
than 3,000 beacons across its national OOH network to enhance its targeting and data capabilities in the 
outdoor advertising space. 
 Attractions and Events —Museums in   Los Angeles  ,   zoos in Italy  ,   SXSW  , and many other  attractions 
and events  are using beacons to better understand visitors, enhance their experience, and promote sales. 
Beacon-enabled apps reveal areas visited, dwell time, and other granular aspects, allowing organizers and 
advertisers to provide visitors with relevant information, services, and offers that match attendees’ interests 
and on-site behavior. 
 Restaurants and Bars — Restaurants and bars are leveraging beacons to engage and better serve 
customers. Tillster is   integrating    beacons into its mobile ordering and payment solution, allowing customers 
at quick-serve restaurants to order and pay for their food without standing in line or waiting on a server. 
Touchtunes is   introducing  beacons into its interactive music and entertainment network in over 60,000 
social venues. 
 Beacon Placement and Purpose 
 Beacons are a relatively new phenomenon. They can be affixed to surfaces (walls, shelves, etc.) or embedded 
in objects (such as ATMs, vending machines, fixtures, access points, even products and packaging). In 
fact, Gimbal recently   announced  that it is licensing its beacon firmware to enable almost any device with 
 Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to act as a beacon. 

CHAPTER 15 ■ UNDERSTANDING THE INTEGRATION OF MOBILE, BEACONS, AND OUT-OF-HOME MEDIA 
271
 The primary purpose of a beacon is to send a signal via Bluetooth that can be detected by mobile 
devices in the vicinity of the beacon. When a mobile app programmed to recognize the beacon’s signal 
comes within a specified distance (e.g., from within inches to up to 50-75 meters), the app “wakes up,” 
detects the beacon’s presence, registers the event, and (typically) displays a message, ad, offer or other 
communication on the user’s device. 
 Beacon Platforms 
 A beacon platform consists of hardware (beacons themselves), software, and one or more mobile apps 
capable of recognizing beacons in particular locations.
• 
 Beacons —Hardware consists of one or more beacons placed at various locations in 
and around a location, both indoors and outside. Beacons can also be embedded in 
fixtures, displays, and kiosks and installed on PCs and other devices via the USB port.  
• 
 Integrated app(s) —One or more mobile apps capable of recognizing the beacon(s) in 
a particular location. The apps may include a brand or retailer app; a third-party app, 
such as RetailMeNot or Shazam; a social media app; or some other app. 
• 
 Beacon management software —Allows the beacon owner or its partner to configure 
and monitor the status of beacons. For example, for each beacon specifying unique 
identifiers and their range; monitoring battery life; and so on. 
• 
 Proximity engagement software —allows the beacon owner or its agency partner 
to set up and manage campaigns. Once a beacon’s signal has been detected, 
a campaign simply tells the app what to do, e.g., for first-time visitors, “show a 
welcome with 25% offer;” for returning guests, present a link to enroll in the loyalty 
program; as fans exit a venue, present a link to purchase a season pass; etc. 
 User Requirements 
 To participate in campaigns in locations enabled by beacons, the user must have a Bluetooth-enabled 
mobile device; have Bluetooth turned on; have one or more apps on their mobile devices capable of 
interacting with beacons; and opt-in to receive alerts, messages, and offers from the paired app(s). Google’s 
recently introduced   Eddystone  platform relaxes the “paired apps” requirement, but introduces   trade-offs  
related to data access and ownership. 
 How Beacons Multiply the Effectiveness of Mobile and OOH 
 OOH and mobile are effective channels in their own right. However, the combination of the two is much 
more effective than either of the channels by themselves. When beacons and BLE (Bluetooth)-enabled 
devices are introduced into the mix, the effectiveness of mobile as well as OOH is   multiplied  . Various 
capabilities enabled by mobile and beacons are being integrated with OOH, as explained next and illustrated 
in Figure  15-4 . 

CHAPTER 15 ■ UNDERSTANDING THE INTEGRATION OF MOBILE, BEACONS, AND OUT-OF-HOME MEDIA  
272
 Stage 1:  Geo-Targeted OOH 
 By profiling audiences in locations and places, OOH media planners determine the best placements 
for advertisers and their campaigns. Historically, planners have relied on surveys and other sources of 
demographic data to profile location-based audiences. Now, third-party mobile data sources such as Placed 
and PlaceIQ provide richer and more granular data, including demographics as well as user interests, travel 
history (including stores visited before and after), and even spending patterns. PlaceIQ   profiles  mobile 
audiences in a billion 100 x 100 square meter tiles, over 27 unique time periods. 
 Stage 2:  Adaptive DOOH 
 In the United States, there are   more  than 110   Digital OOH   (DOOH) networks. Like digital media on the 
Internet, DOOH can display ads dynamically, rotating and displaying ads in 15-60 second intervals. With 
data from mobile users, Digital OOH (DOOH) advertising shown in, around, and on transit, malls, venues, 
and other locations can be tailored to audiences based on time of day as well as on location. When a concert, 
game, or other major event is held at a venue, DOOH can tailor nearby content to fans’ profiles and interests. 
By detecting and adapting dynamically to mobile consumers, DOOH offers an even more flexible and 
  powerful channel   for brands, retailers, and locations. 
  Figure 15-4.  The five stages  of  MOHBE integration 
 

CHAPTER 15 ■ UNDERSTANDING THE INTEGRATION OF MOBILE, BEACONS, AND OUT-OF-HOME MEDIA 
273
 Stage 3:  Interactive 
 Mobile also allows consumers to interact with OOH ads, both static and digital. For instance, consumers 
can share an ad with others, receive additional information and offers, or respond to a “call to action” 
(e.g., enroll in a loyalty program; enter a contest; answer a trivia question; and so on). Mobile consumers 
can interact with OOH ads by sharing an OOH ad or offer on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or other social 
media; responding via SMS to a “text message-enabled” OOH ad; scanning a QR code shown on an OOH 
ad; or tapping an   NFC  equipped smartphone on an OOH ad with an embedded NFC sensor. Increasingly, 
advertisers are including multiple ways for consumers to interact with OOH.  
 Stage 4:  MOHBE (Mobile + OOH Enabled by Beacons) 
 Integrating beacons into the mobile and OOH mix delivers six important benefits.
• 
 First, while geo-targeting with mobile data improves audience profiling and 
selection, beacons provide even more precise targeting. For example, consumers 
who are actually on a particular subway train; in a bus shelter; in a specific 
department, aisle, or even near a particular display in a store.  
• 
 When consumers are exposed to a beacon-enabled OOH ad, the mobile app 
registers the event along with dwell time (length of exposure) and other useful 
metrics. By studying traffic patterns, advertisers can determine the best time to 
engage with visitors. Additional audience insights such as the apps visitors use 
contribute to better design and content of engagements and even physical signage.  
• 
 Beacon-triggered events can also prompt app(s) to engage consumers in  appropriate 
ways. For example, present a push notification with a call-to-action or display an 
ad, reminder, or coupon when the consumer nears a retailer where the advertised 
product is sold. 
• 
 All of this happens  automatically , without the consumer having to scan or tap an ad, 
text, or take some other action. Thus, beacons also make it easier for consumers to 
engage with OOH media. 
• 
 A beacon-paired app can also detect when consumers exposed to an OOH ad 
subsequently enter a store in which beacons are present, enabling the advertiser to 
attribute behaviors (e.g., store visits) to OOH ad campaigns. These events—uniquely 
observed with beacon-enabled apps and OOH—provide definitive measures of 
conversion from digital messaging to physical visits. 
• 
 Lastly, these events and others can be recorded as part of an individual consumer’s 
history and used to distinguish first-time, returning, interested, engaged, and other 
types of consumers based on previous beacon-triggered events. 
 Stage 5:  MOHBE + Programmatic 
 With   programmatic  platforms advertisers use real-time bidding to automatically purchase digital inventory 
(web, in-app, video, and others) that matches and reaches specific, narrowly defined audience profiles. 
Growing rapidly across channels, programmatic is   projected  to account for more than half of all digital 
advertising in the next 18-24 months. OOH is also beginning to integrate inventories with programmatic 
platforms. Programmatic makes MOHBE even more valuable by simplifying purchasing of ad inventory, 
which as PJSC’s Mark Boidman   pointed out  is badly needed in OOH and, potentially, by boosting the value 
of OOH inventory and return on ad spend (ROAS) for both both static and digital OOH.   

CHAPTER 15 ■ UNDERSTANDING THE INTEGRATION OF MOBILE, BEACONS, AND OUT-OF-HOME MEDIA  
274
 Industry Leaders’ Perspectives on MOHBE 
 Industry leaders are bullish on the prospects of MOHBE, as reflected in the following comments from immr 
interviews with industry thought leaders.
 “OOH can capture consumers’ attention during those ‘moments of pause’ when they’re 
away from home. Beacons allow us to understand who’s passing by and who’s pausing, and 
potentially the next opportunity to engage… they are also cost effective and unobtrusive.” 
David Krupp, CEO, Kinetic U.S. 
 “Mobile allows consumers to experience the world in connected ways. It’s also changing 
what we know about audiences… ’Did consumers actually see my message? What actions 
did they take?’ Mobile reveals this and more, in real time.” Josh Kruter, SVP, Digital, Clear 
Channel Outdoor 
 “Beacons engage mobile users and provide a method of attribution to show that OOH 
works. With other traditional media channels continuing to fall out of favor, OOH should 
benefit from those trends and grow its share of the market.” Mark Boidman, Managing 
Director, Peter J. Solomon Company  
  “The movements of people in the real world are incredibly valuable… beacons allow us to 
present ads and information that are contextual and immediately relevant. But the user 
experience has to be easy and can’t be interruptive.” Mike Gamaroff, Managing Director, 
Kinetic U.S. 
 “OOH has always been great to target where, but now mobile data allows us to target 
the when as well. Beacon-enabled campaigns have been off the charts in terms of 
engagement… With beacons you also get an almost real-time ROI attribution model.” 
Ryan Laul, Director, [d] theory (OMG) 
 “[With beacons] OOH can engage consumers on their life’s journey during the day in a very 
contextual, relevant way … delivering the right message at the right time and place to the 
right person, and then measuring it.” Ray Rotolo, SVP, OOH Assets, Gimbal 
 “Beacons allow brands to understand a user’s journey from beginning to end and serve 
personalized messages—based on location and proximity—that feel less like ads and more 
like helpful content to consumers.” Regis Maher, President and Co-founder, do it outdoors 
media 
 Recommendations 
 The following sections provide some recommendations for advertisers, mobile apps, and OOH media. 
 Advertisers Should Seize the MOHBE Opportunity 
 Many large advertisers are well positioned to capitalize on the MOHBE opportunity. Combining beacons 
with mobile and OOH offers more granular data for targeting; permits  advertisers   to leverage the consumer’s 
history, location, and context; and allows the brand to engage consumers in personalized and frictionless 

CHAPTER 15 ■ UNDERSTANDING THE INTEGRATION OF MOBILE, BEACONS, AND OUT-OF-HOME MEDIA 
275
ways, including retargeting consumers on mobile who have been exposed to an OOH ad. MOHBE is likely to 
be most valuable for the following types of brands and products:
• 
 Brands with brick and mortar locations 
• 
 Brands with their own compelling mobile apps 
• 
 Brands introducing new products 
• 
 Brands in “high involvement” product categories  
• 
 Products with limited availability or supply  
• 
 Products for which consumer needs vary by location or season 
• 
 Products requiring explanation 
 Leading national brands, especially those with their own mobile apps and existing advertising on 
OOH, are uniquely positioned to integrate and reap the benefits of beacons. Customers value the enhanced 
functionality beacons bring; are more likely to have or download the brand’s or a partner’s app; and they have 
locations, content, or other assets that reveal whether consumers visited or took some action. In sum, for these 
brands, the cost and complexity to “test and learn” with MOHBE are relatively low and the payoff is high.   
 Mobile Apps Must Partner with Brands and OOH Media 
 When a mobile  app comes within range of a beacon that it recognizes, the app can engage its owner with 
messages, offers, and ads tailored to the location and individual. Of course, few brands have persuaded 
more than 10-15% of their customers to download their apps. As a result, brands and retailers are relying on 
third-party apps—many of them shopping related—to serve as “partner apps” and complete the platform. 
That’s brand + beacons + mobile app. For instance,   Lord & Taylor  has worked with SnipSnap; Levi Strauss 
has worked with RetailMeNot; and in Norway, Coca-Cola has partnered with   VG  , a leading Norwegian 
newspaper with a popular mobile app. 
 While Gimbal and other beacon platform providers are facilitating the development of the ecosystem, the 
playing field is wide open for mobile apps to forge partnerships with OOH media and brands. Since many apps 
are aimed at consumers within a vertical—for example, health and fitness, travel, entertainment, home and 
garden, etc.—there are many natural pairings of third-party apps and OOH media for brands and locations. 
 For mobile apps, MOHBE offers a number of significant benefits, including more personalized user 
experiences, offers, and content from brand partners tailored to the user’s precise location, history, and 
interests. It also offers additional revenue from in-app ads, push notifications, app downloads, and other 
sources. 
 OOH Ecosystem Should Rapidly “Beaconize” 
 With beacons spreading rapidly, for  OOH industry leaders the opportunity is clear—integrate beacons into 
OOH and work closely with brands and their agency partners (both creative and media buying) to help them 
recognize, test, and demonstrate the benefits of MOHBE to consumers and advertisers. 
 Recent developments raise the urgency for the OOH industry. Facebook began   giving  away beacons 
to small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), part of its plan to become a dominant player in local 
advertising. The majority of Facebook’s 1.4 billion users now access Facebook on their mobile devices. 
As part of the agreement, SMBs share data from beacon-enabled interactions with Facebook. Through 
a subsidiary, Google is also   investing  in OOH companies. With their substantial audiences, assets, and 
capabilities, Facebook, Google and other digital leaders will continue to be dominant forces in mobile 
advertising. If OOH incumbents are slow to seize the opportunity and integrate beacons, mobile, and OOH, 
companies from outside the industry could assume the mantel and disrupt the status quo.    

CHAPTER 15 ■ UNDERSTANDING THE INTEGRATION OF MOBILE, BEACONS, AND OUT-OF-HOME MEDIA  
276
 Challenges for the Industry and Its Partners 
 While mobile and beacon solutions present a unique opportunity for the OOH industry and its partners—
OOH agencies, proximity marketing firms, beacon solution providers and app publishers—in order to 
capitalize on the opportunity, the industry and individual companies must address a number of important 
challenges. 
 Consumer Experience — Consistently delivering a positive experience for consumers may well be the 
single most important challenge. OOH and partners must determine which apps on a consumer’s phone are 
given permission to detect and use a beacon signal; how many beacon-triggered messages can be presented 
to a consumer during a period of time; how to distinguish and address first-time versus repeat visitors; and 
others. The OOH industry must work together with leading partners to collectively share best practices and 
proactively establish standards and certification for participants. 
 Securing Beacon Networks — Much like a web site, mobile app, or any other digital platform, access to 
beacon networks must be managed carefully. While technically different, intrusions have the same chilling 
effect as ad fraud, spam, Wi-Fi sniffing, and other malicious activities. To prevent unauthorized access by 
apps, advertisers or any other party that has not been given explicit permission, enterprise-grade security 
is a critical feature in beacon management platforms. OOH media owners must take proactive measures to 
secure their beacon networks and mitigate these risks. 
 Managing and Protecting Data —Combined with OOH, beacon-enabled solutions generate an 
enormous amount of  data on “events” as well as consumer responses (or their absence) to campaigns. 
Examples include data on foot traffic past an OOH site; dwell time by users; and others, all by time of day. 
In addition to security, additional complexities must be considered—for example, which data to capture; 
where the data are stored; who has access to the data; how exposure to OOH ads is combined with store 
visits, spend, and other data from first- and third-party sources; and more. These questions require careful 
consideration, coordination, and compliance across the MOHBE ecosystem. 
 Beacons and Privacy —As noted, beacons do not capture or store data; they simply transmit signals 
that apps can detect and respond to. In addition, consumers must turn on Bluetooth on their mobile 
devices to receive beacon signals and opt-in to give an app permission to send messages, present offers, 
etc. Nonetheless, when paired with beacons, mobile apps are in a position to observe new types of user 
behaviors. To protect consumers’ privacy the OOH industry and its app partners must adopt and adhere 
to best practices like those listed in Table  15-1 . The Federal Trade Commission has also   issued reports  
recommending ways that key players in mobile inform consumers about their data and privacy practices. 
 Table 15-1.  Using TACT to Preserve Consumers’ Privacy 
 Goal 
 Approach 
 Transparency 
 Give consumers information about the data being collected, the manner in which it is 
being collected, and how it will be used. 
 Added Value  
 Make consumers aware of the value they are receiving, e.g., how they benefit from 
providing their personal data. 
 Control  
 Give consumers control by informing them who their data is being shared with and 
allowing them to opt-out of data collection at any time. 
 Trust 
 Collect only the data needed and use the data collected to deliver consumer value.

CHAPTER 15 ■ UNDERSTANDING THE INTEGRATION OF MOBILE, BEACONS, AND OUT-OF-HOME MEDIA 
277
 Summary 
 Beacons represent an enormous opportunity for the OOH industry and its partners. By integrating beacons, 
OOH media owners gain a new digital network that complements their physical assets, increasing the 
value of OOH properties and enhancing the effectiveness of OOH advertising. Advertisers gain a deeper 
understanding of mobile consumers, the ability to target specific OOH audiences, and measure the impact 
of their OOH ads. For mobile app partners, beacons provide a bridge between the digital and physical, 
yielding insights that can be used to improve functionality and the user’s experience. These insights translate 
into more precise targeting, higher eCPMs and, with more relevant, value-added content, more satisfied 
users. Finally, consumers stand to gain by receiving content (messages, ads, and so on), offers, and services 
that more closely match their needs and interests, in places and at times when they can use them. 
 To capitalize on the MOHBE opportunity, key players—including OOH media, agency and tech 
partners, advertisers, and mobile app publishers—must work closely together to develop, share, and adopt 
best practices. Provided the consortium integrates these capabilities in a systematic, consumer-centric 
fashion, the prospects are bright for the OOH industry, advertisers, and consumers.

 “The talent is in the choices .” 
 —Robert De Niro 
 Bluetooth beacons have disrupted and transformed proximity marketing. They have many advantages, 
but they also have limitations that should be understood and considered when designing a solution. By 
understanding those limitations and the alternative options, a solution designer can make choices between 
one technology and another, or choose which ones to blend together in a solution. This chapter, and the 
other chapters in this section of the guide, look at the main alternatives to Bluetooth beacons to provide 
location and proximity for mobile apps. This section is designed to give you a good basis for selecting the 
right tool for the job. 
 In this chapter, we will discuss:
• 
 Machine vision and camera analytics 
• 
 Li-Fi: LEDs and visual light communication (VLC)  
• 
 Magnetic resonance 
• 
 Ultra wide band 
• 
 Wi-Fi 
 In the other chapters in this section, we will explore:
• 
 Use of GPS, Wi-Fi, and geofencing 
• 
 Barcodes, QR codes, RFID, and NFC 
• 
 Cellular network technologies

 Machine Vision and Camera Analytics 
 
 
 On Dave’s return to the ship, after HAL 9000 has killed the rest of the crew] 
 “Look Dave, I can see you’re really upset about this. I honestly think you ought to sit down 
calmly, take a stress pill, and think things over.  ”  
  HAL  9000,  2001: A Space Odyssey 

CHAPTER 16 ■ ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES TO BLUETOOTH BEACONS
282
 You may have missed the fact that there were some prerequisites for reading this book. Just to refresh your 
memory, those included the building of a replica of any of the  Star Wars space vehicles out of Legos and the 
watching of Stanley Kubrick’s film  2001: A Space Odyssey (including the long psychedelic sequence toward 
the end). You will need to have completed the second of those prerequisites in order to appreciate this piece 
of the book on machine vision. 
 One of the best bits of acting in  2001 was when Dave the astronaut is having a showdown with HAL the 
psychotic computer. The fact that it’s  HAL’s performance that is so moving (as Dave pulls out his memory 
cards and he sings “Daisy”) just goes to show either how bad the other actors were, or how good Douglas 
Rain was, the actor who provided the voice for HAL. 
 The point is, that having a computer able to observe a human, know that the image it’s receiving is in 
fact a human, and even detect the emotions of that human is “flipping” amazing. The even more amazing 
thing is that exactly that capability is being deployed in retail stores today. 
 Computer vision  algorithms can analyze real-time video feeds and process the imagery, separating 
moving, overlapping objects, detecting whether they are people and counting the people that have been 
identified. These “intelligent” camera devices are mounted near potential store locations, to analyze the 
traffic that might come into a store if it were to be opened there. They are set up by doorways in stores 
that are open for business, in order to count the potential customers that are passing by and compare that 
number with total they see coming inside. This yields a passerby to visitor conversion rate, which can be 
tracked over time of day and by day to measure the effect of window displays and other marketing programs. 
 For those of us who as children waved our hands in front of the optical sensor at the entrance of the 
store to make it go “ping” repeatedly, this may not seem a big deal, but the analysis that these devices are 
doing is a lot more sophisticated than the old-fashioned light sensor. 
 Capabilities of Camera Analytics 
 The machine vision of today can detect the gender of customers, their approximate age, what kind of mood 
they are in, and how engaged they are in any media being presented on displays or billboards. 
 One vendor, Kairos, claims 94% accuracy in detecting a person, 92% accuracy in detecting gender, and 
85% accuracy in detecting mood. Arguably this is better than could be expected from a person doing the 
same work, given that people are prone to distractions and can be overwhelmed by crowds. 
 A key point in favor of using this technology is that unlike beacons and other wireless systems, camera-
based analytics can count all customers. They don’t have to be running a particular app. They don’t even 
need to have a phone. 
 Like any technology, it’s not perfect, so when looking at suppliers, it’s important to establish how close 
to the theoretical 100% coverage they can achieve based on the specifics of the camera positions that are 
available and the measurements required. One of the challenges is that machine vision can have difficulties 
distinguishing staff from customers. RetailNext has filed a patent around the use of Bluetooth tags issued to 
staff to make sure that staff are removed from the results of camera analytics. Radius Networks produces a 
beacon with a wrist strap made by Swatch, so that staff can wear beacons for just this purpose. 
 Generally camera analytics are not used to drive the kind of one-to-one interactions or personalized 
retargeting that beacons can be used for. There are notable exceptions, such as using cameras for virtual 
changing rooms, where customers pose for the camera and a display presents their image as it would look if 
they were wearing a variety of different clothes. 
 Deployment of Camera Analytics 
 Some systems operate through integration with the video feed from existing security cameras. This can save 
on capital costs and installation, but may prove to be too restrictive for certain applications where people’s 
faces need to viewed, or a person count is required in a specific part of the store where cameras are not 
already deployed. In this case specialized camera sensors are used, as depicted in Figure  16-1 . 

CHAPTER 16 ■ ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES TO BLUETOOTH BEACONS
283
 Devices can consist of monocular cameras, stereoscopic cameras, and cameras integrated with BLE and 
Wi-Fi sensors. Wi-Fi sensors can record the network addresses of phones, recording those to compare with 
future visits and use that to calculate if the customer is a return visitor or not. 
 The camera hardware typically requires power, which can be delivered over Ethernet cables as an 
alternative to running a main power line to the device. 
 Camera devices can cost as much as $1,000 each and so are seen as being quite expensive, especially for 
larger format stores. 
 Applications of Camera Analytics 
 The applications for camera analytics span marketing and operational domains, including:
• 
 Counting customers and conversion —Comparing the changing number of visitors 
across different stores can help identify problems and best practices. Once a count of 
people entering the store is available, then the conversion ratio between visitors and 
sales can be calculated using sales receipts. 
• 
 Satisfaction and Service Times —Time in queues and the time spent waiting to be 
served correlates with customer satisfaction and likely return visits. 
• 
 Staff scheduling and safety —Real-time customer traffic numbers provide empirical 
input to the task of scheduling sufficient sales and security staff for satisfaction and

 Camera Analytics Summary 
 The  key strength of machine vision/camera technology is the coverage of 100% of the visitors to a venue, 
with no apps required. It is a passive technology that is good for observation rather than interaction, with the 
exception of HAL, the psychotic computer from  2001 and a few edge cases where the camera may drive the 
personalization of content on digital displays. This makes it suited to analytics functions. When alerts and 
engagement are required, beacons need to be added to the mix. See Table  16-1 .

 Li-Fi: Visual Light Communication 
 “ A rooster crows only when it sees the light. Put him in the dark and he'll never crow. I have 
seen the light and I'm crowing  .” 
 —  Muhammad Ali  
 LED light vendors have been crowing about the capabilities of the latest generation of lighting technology 
and it’s easy to see why (Figure  16-3 ). Visual light communication ( VLC) or Li-Fi is potentially one of the most 
disruptive of the alternative and complementary technologies to Bluetooth beacons. The location accuracy it 
yields is extremely precise, as close as four inches in real-world situations. It can also be used to measure the 
height and orientation of a phone, so that apps can be informed precisely which way the handset is pointing.  
 Figure 16-3.  The  BREEZ series recessed indirect LED light is typical of what might be used to replace 
fluorescent lights in a retail environment 
 For those of us who have struggled to find a specific type of medication at a pharmacy, imagine a product 
search app that guides you to the correct aisle, the correct shelf, and then the correct place on the shelf. 
 However, there are  limitations . In order to do this, the app performing the computation has to be in the 
foreground, and a special LED lighting infrastructure needs to be installed. 
 Vendors are deploying enhanced LED lighting systems with Bluetooth beacons integrated into the 
fixtures, in order to offer the best of both technologies to venues and the developers of mobile apps. With this 
mixture, Bluetooth beacons can be used to trigger alerts that encourage the user to open the app and bring it 
into the foreground, at which point the LEDs can be used and the greater levels of precision can be achieved. 
The beacons use an optional radio built into the light fixture (the receptacle the bulb screws into) that can 
perform other functions such as communicating with control systems (see Figure  16-4 ) and the other lights 
via a Bluetooth mesh network. 
 

CHAPTER 16 ■ ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES TO BLUETOOTH BEACONS
287
 Figure 16-4.  The  Distech controller acts as a gateway between the web and Acuity’s BLE-network in the store 
 In addition to acting as a beacon, the Bluetooth Smart radios can be used to send control signals to dim 
the lighting and automatically respond as part of cost and energy saving programs. A “ demand response 
system  ” can reduce the intensity of lights and their power consumption at extreme peak times when the grid 
is under pressure, or when elevated consumption is in danger of pushing the retailer into a more expensive 
pricing band for that month’s electricity tariff. 
 Let’s look at how the technology works, who the players are, and some of the business and strategic 
implications of these impressive capabilities. 
 Calculating Location Using Light 
 Communication using light isn’t new. The Greeks did it, using signal fires on hilltops over a thousand years 
BC. The ability to turn an LED light on and off at nanosecond speeds creates a lot more data bandwidth than 
the Greeks had when passing on the warnings about an approaching enemy. 
 

CHAPTER 16 ■ ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES TO BLUETOOTH BEACONS
288
 The speeds used for VLC are so fast the human eye can’t detect the flickering. Changing the frequency 
with which an LED bulb is turned on and off is the basis of transmitting data, which could include media 
streams or much shorter signals. With the right software analyzing the sighting of multiple lights via a 
phone’s front-facing camera, it’s possible to work out the location of the phone (a more serious application 
for the camera than just taking all those “selfies”). 
 The image from a camera that sees the LED lights is used to calculate the angle of arrival of the light 
signal from a known position in order to deduce the location of the phone. This works in the same way as 
mariners observing the angle of arrival of light from the stars in order to navigate. Mariners might identity 
a set of stars, such as the North (Pole) star and the stars in the Orion constellation, that have a predictable 
position in the sky and work out their own location based on that. 
 Each light fixture broadcasts an identity code so that the software on the phone can lookup the location 
of the fixture in the X, Y, and Z axes. This will have been recorded in the cloud based on a site survey. The SDK 
provided by the LED vendor can then use trigonometry to deduce the location of the phone in X, Y, and Z axes. 
 Tungsten and fluorescent lights can’t easily transmit identity signals that can be used in this way, so this 
technique is dependent on the adoption of LED lighting infrastructure.  
 A Wave of Change in Lighting 
 Venues are moving to LED lighting, but this isn’t happening overnight.  Replacement cycles for this kind of 
technology are slow, occurring on average, once a decade. Replacing lighting in a venue is a large, expensive, 
and disruptive project. As infrastructure changes go, beacons are at the other end of that spectrum of 
expense and disruption. You can deploy beacons during the day without shutting the store down. It’s 
unlikely that any venue will replace its lighting just to support indoor location in mobile applications. The 
costs of the new systems are many thousands of dollars for a large venue. However, if a new store is being 
built, or an old store is being refurbished, then the ROI for LED lighting is significant. In addition to the 
energy savings, there are savings due to the longer life of the LED lights, which reduce the spending on bulbs 
and more significantly, the labor costs associated with installing them in hard to reach locations. 
 On the one hand this switch to LEDs will take a while to happen; on the other hand, the economics are 
compelling. It’s a major wave of change rippling across venues, irrespective of any proximity engagement 
opportunities. While the pace may be slower, there is a level of inevitability driven by hard cost savings, 
which we can’t claim for the deployment of Bluetooth beacons. 
 Large Vendors that Are Committed 
 The other aspect to consider when predicting the future success of Li-Fi is the commitment of the LED 
vendors to make this work. We have seen opportunistic, tentative support for Bluetooth beacons from 
companies such as Facebook and PayPal. Facebook are proceeding slowly and PayPal ended up killing their 
beacon program after a change in leadership and some trials whose results didn’t meet the expectations of 
the new regime. 
 For the  LED lighting vendors such as Acuity, GE, and Philips, multi-billion dollar companies, making 
Li-Fi a success appears to be a priority. They see what’s happening to their current business model. After 
the initial wave of replacement and adoption of LEDs has happened, a hole in their revenue flow is opening 
up that needs to be filled. Once all their customers have switched to LED, the annuity revenue stream from 
replacing failing light bulbs will shrink dramatically. Filling that hole becomes an imperative. They see 
proximity services revenue as being a way of filling the approaching revenue gap. This threat and the new 
opportunity are visible at the top levels of their organizations. 
 Acuity has shown what seems to be the greatest level of commitment to the opportunity, through 
multiple corporate acquisitions, including ByteLight and Geometri. They are assembling a focused team 
of staff with new skills, which are not native to the lighting industry, and a complete stack of analytics and 
Bluetooth beacon technology. 

CHAPTER 16 ■ ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES TO BLUETOOTH BEACONS
289
 Philips claims to have intellectual property in this area, has been conducting trials with Target, and 
elevated their trial project with Carrefour, the French hypermarket giant, to being discussed in their Q2 2015 
earnings calls. 
 GE—whose partnership with ByteLight was aborted when their competitor, Acuity, acquired the 
startup—is promoting its own indoor location service that includes Bluetooth beacons. Like Acuity, GE has 
licensed technology from Qualcomm to perform indoor positioning with Li-Fi. 
 A  Timing and Coverage Issue 
 For retail deployments, it’s unlikely that every store in a large chain will switch to LED lighting at the same 
time. The fact that VLC services may not be available at all stores is not a disqualifier for using the services in 
a subset of stores, but it can impede the marketing of such services. A retail brand doesn’t want to promote 
demand for a product finder and then disappoint large numbers of shoppers when it’s not available in their 
local store.  
 VLC Li-Fi Summary 
 The adoption of VLC has a reassuring inevitability about it. The precision is high, the incremental 
infrastructure is negligible, and the vendors are motivated and capable. 
 However, the need to have an app running in the foreground imposes major  limitations . It’s clear that 
adoption will be slow-paced relative to beacons. This is a prime example of Bluetooth and another location 
technology being better together in the same solution. See Table  16-2 .

 Free is a pretty good price. Bluetooth beacons have disrupted other technologies because of the lower costs 
associated with the hardware and the lower cost of deployment of these battery powered sensors. One of the 
challengers to Bluetooth beacons has no capital costs and no maintenance costs. 
 The magnetic resonance location algorithm uses the compass within a smartphone to measure 
fluctuations in the magnetic fields that emanate from the earth and the steel within the structure of 
buildings. This is combined with monitoring of the phone’s gyroscope, accelerometer, and a floor plan to 
perform dead reckoning 1 to estimate the current location of a smartphone.

 The  accuracy of this, for the purpose of performing wayfinding within a big box store, was good 95% of 
the time (1-3 meters), based on a demonstration this author witnessed. 5% of the time the “blue dot” popped 
up in the wrong aisle of the Staples store we were in, although the product has improved since then. The 
experience wasn’t perfect, but it was good value for the money. 
 IndoorAtlas 
 The leading provider of this technology is IndoorAtlas, a small company that was established in Finland 
and spun out of the University of Oulu in 2012 (see Figure  16-6 ). They claim to have a comprehensive patent 
portfolio on indoor location driven by magnetic resonance. Their survey app now uses Wi-Fi signals to 
augment the input from magnetic fields and motion.  
 The steel structure of  buildings has a magnetic signature that identifies a location within the structure. 
The building is surveyed using a smartphone to measure the magnetic fluctuations as the person doing the 
calibrating walks around the building. A  map  of the building is loaded prior to doing the survey and the 
surveyor indicates where they are on the map. See Figure  16-5 for an example.

 Like many proximity companies, the product is free when used for modest numbers of users (up to 1000), 
after which an active user price comes into effect, with pricing per active user less than 20 cents a month. 
 Given their patent position, there are very few competitors, which works for them at one level but 
at another level hinders the development of a competitive ecosystem and therefore awareness of the 
technology. Buyers, and the press, like to have options and competitors to choose from and talk about. One 
competitor that does exist is a smaller startup called GiPStech. They are based in Italy and use magnetic 
resonance along with any signals available from existing Wi-Fi and Bluetooth beacons.

 Limitations of Magnetic Resonance 
 Magnetic resonance doesn’t work well outside. The technique requires the use of GPS or Wi-Fi to orientate 
the system so that it knows which building map to use. With that starting point established it also requires 
the user to be in motion, similar to the way a magnetic stripe on credit card needs to be in motion in order 
for it to be read. 
 The other limitations stem from a lack of deep integration by Apple and Google into their operating 
systems. The app needs to be in the foreground when calculating its location. This is not a technology that 
can drive an alert to pop up when the app is in the background. 
 Magnetic Resonance Summary 
 Where  infrastructure deployment and capital costs are at a premium, as it is across hundreds of thousands 
of venues in China, magnetic resonance deserves serious consideration. It’s hard to argue at the price. 
Given zero cost for the infrastructure, it seems that IndoorAtlas is not getting the mindshare it deserves. 
Success requires more than just a good idea. IndoorAtlas is seen as a little quirky and “foreign”. It will need to 
overcome this in order to gain broad acceptance in the U.S. market. See Table  16-3 .

 Ultra Wide Band 
 
 
 “The wide world is all about you: you can fence yourselves in, but you cannot forever 
fence it out. ” 
 —J. R. R. Tolkien 
 Ultra Wide Band ( UWB)  is a radio technology that delivers very impressive accuracy, as fine grain as 
four inches. It is ahead of many of the competing high-accuracy techniques in the race to market, with 
production applications operating today. BMW is using Ultra Wide Band technology to help automate its car 
production line in Regensburg, Germany. 
 The key dependency on  adoption of UWB is an enterprise’s willingness to invest in a dedicated UWB 
infrastructure. UWB beacons are tracked by UWB transceivers. UWB can’t track phones, as there’s no 
UWB radio in iOS or Android smartphones. As a result, the application of UWB has been more focused on 
industrial verticals such as warehouse logistics, manufacturing, and healthcare, where UWB beacons can be 
attached to forklifts, pallets on the production line, patients, staff, or medical equipment. 

CHAPTER 16 ■ ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES TO BLUETOOTH BEACONS

 Why UWB Is So Much More Accurate 
 It’s interesting to understand why UWB is more accurate than most Bluetooth and Wi-Fi techniques because 
it’s a pretty cool technology and it informs our understanding of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, as well as UWB. 
 As its name suggests, Ultra Wide Band uses a very broad range of spectrum (about a thousand TV 
channels worth) over which to send its signals. This overlaps with the spectrum used by other radio devices. 
The spectrum used is unlicensed; you don’t have to pay to access the airwaves with UWB. The  Federal 
Communications Committee (FCC) permits the overlap with other frequencies because the interference 
created is so small that the impact is not disruptive to the performance of other wireless signals. 
 UWB  location-tracking solutions use short pulse transmissions across their band of spectrum. This 
technique is less susceptible to multi-path interference, which is an important advantage. With UWB pulses, 
it’s easier to disregard the pulse signals that arrive via an indirect, reflected path.  Multi-path interference 
is part of what makes proximity measurement with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signals (which are sustained for 
longer) less precise for proximity measurement 2 . 
 UWB uses  low-power transmissions that provide a range of approximately 50–200 meters. UWB 
beacons or tags can transmit these pulses very rapidly (up to 200 times a second). This means that very 
fast movements can be tracked. At their Consumer Electronics Show 2016 keynote presentation, Intel 
demonstrated the use of UWB sensors on musicians’ hands. The musicians moved their hands rapidly 
through the air to play invisible virtual instruments. Their hand movements were tracked and used to 
generate sounds that were played in sync with regular, real musical instruments. This required very high 
fidelity in tracking of movement and a high level of “currency” in order for the instrument to be played in 
time with the other traditional instruments. 3 
 UWB Proximity measurement is performed using  time of arrival (ToA) and angle of arrival ( AoA ) 
techniques. These measurements are performed using transceiver devices that are placed around a room 
to perform trilateration of the signals coming from the UWB tags or beacons. As we discuss elsewhere, these 
techniques are inherently more accurate in fixing a location. 
 UWB Vendors and Applications 
 This is not meant to be a comprehensive list of vendors, but we have listed examples of the different types of 
vendors in the UWB ecosystem. 
 UWB Chipsets 
 One of the leading suppliers of UWB  chips is decaWave. They claim four-inch accuracy for solutions built 
with their chipset. They have been active in the standardization efforts since the earliest days and have a 
long list of  value added resellers (VARS) who make development tools, System on Modules (SoMs), devices, 
applications, and custom solutions based on the decaWave chips. These VARS include Agilion, Bluflux, 
Ciholas, Idolink, OpenRTLS, Red Point, RTLS, Sewio, Wipelot, and Woxu.  
 2 The use of signal strength by Wi-Fi and Bluetooth beacons as a proxy for distance is also inherently challenging.

296
 Standards Turmoil 
 The standards history around UWB has been tumultuous. The UWB Forum, which was set up in 2004 
to promote the standard, clashed with the rival WiMedia Alliance and disbanded after two of its largest 
founding members—Freescale and Motorola—left. In 2006 the IEEE committee focused on completing 
the 802.15.3a standard for UWB disbanded, due to an inability of competing factions within the working 
group to agree on competing proposals. WiMedia claimed the mantle of developer of UWB standards and 
produced work focused on use of USB 2.0 over UWB. These were ultimately transferred to the Bluetooth 
Special Interest Group, Wireless USB Promoter Group. The WiMedia Alliance ceased operations in 2010. 
 The proposal for Direct Sequence UWB that lost the battle for adoption in what would have been 
802.15.3a, later resurfaced and found a home in IEEE Standard 802.15.4-2011. Ultimately the  European 
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and the  International Standards Organization (ISO) have 
approved UWB standards. All that maneuvering may have held UWB back from achieving its full potential. 
 In the chess game that characterizes maneuvering between wireless standards bodies, the UWB queen 
has been trapped in a corner, much of the market for transmitting large data streams and connecting 
peripherals in home, office, and industrial locations has been claimed by the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth standards. 
However, given the strength of UWB for proximity location, this is not checkmate. 
 Bluetooth wins when a phone needs to be the receiver of the signal from a beacon, but UWB wins when 
it comes to accurate measurement of distances between beacons and transceiver devices that don’t need 
direct integration with a phone. 
 UWB  Devices 
 Zebra Technologies is one of the larger solution providers in the UWB space with its Dart product line. We 
have also referenced them previously as a provider of barcode readers, RFID readers, Wi-Fi access points, 
and Bluetooth beacons. They provide the following:
• 
 DartTag —Powered by 3V batteries that may last up to seven years if the tag is 
configured to broadcast once a second, IP67 rated, programmable on/off times. 
1.57 x 1.57 x 0.78 inches. 
• 
 DartTag badge —A wearable version of the above; 1.66 x 0.28 x 2.92 inches. 
• 
 Dart sensors —Receivers of the signals from the UWB tags. These can be daisy chained.  
• 
 Dart hub —With embedded software, providing power, data, and a synchronized 
clock for the sensors to which it is connected.  
• 
 DartWand —Used to inventory and configure the tags. 
• 
 Dart Vision Reader —An alternative to multiple sensors, for areas that just require 
presence to be measured, rather than location.     
 A UWB  Integrator and Customer 
 As solution designers in a cutting edge technology sector you have to be energized and enthused by “the 
new,” while maintaining an appropriate level of skepticism to mitigate the effect of Murphy’s Law 4 and the 
half-truths that are told by those in sales mode. 
 4 Murphy’s Law, which essentially is, “Whatever can go wrong, will go wrong,” may have originated from Edward 
Murphy, an engineer working on research into the human body’s tolerance for G-Forces in the 1940s. This R&D project 
involved crash test dummies, chimpanzees, and a rocket sled mounted on a railroad track. What could possibly go 
wrong? Read  A History of Murphy's Law by author Nick T. Spark to find out.

297
 All this is to say that it’s a relief, when researching technology, to find credible evidence of actual 
deployments and a case study that proves the technology delivers what it’s supposed to. 
 Given the claims for UWB’s performance, Ubisense’s case study of the deployment of their UWB 
SmartFactory suite at BMW’s makes for reassuring reading. Here is a summary drawn from various accounts: 
 The Situation: UWB at BMW Germany 
 Ubisense is a British solution provider that focused its application of UWB on the manufacturing sector. 
It claims to have deployed the technology in over 50 manufacturing facilities, with over 6,000 sensors and 
22,000 UWB tags. Its customers include Aston Martin, Audi, Magna, Mini and VW, and BMW. 
 The  BMW installation is at its Regensburg facility in Germany. This factory produces over 1,000 cars a 
day, with 150 workstations on the 1.9 kilometer production line where 9,000 staff work. Multiple car models 
are built on the same line, including the BMW 1 Series, BMW 3 Series, BMW M3, BMW Z4, and four-wheel-
drive models.  
 The Problem 
 With so many interactions and processes occurring simultaneously, errors become inevitable. These 
resulted in delays and waste, which was proving impossible to monitor and avoid. 
 The goal was to sustain continuous flow on the production line, optimizing efficiency and reduce the 
errors, waste, and delays. 
 The Solution 
 Over 470 UWB  sensors were put in place to monitor the position of the cars and manufacturing equipment 
such as automated screwdrivers, riveting tools, and inspection devices. 
 As a vehicle enters a zone, or the equipment approaches a vehicle, the UWB sensors can identify the 
vehicles and automatically assign and initialize computer assisted process equipment. This eliminates 
the use of manual barcode scanning, which saves time and avoids mistakes, which can be costly given the 
products being built. 
 The UWB sensors were integrated into the existing IT systems at the factory using IBS, a quality 
management system produced by Siemens. 
 Results 
 According to BMW staff, the system completely eliminated costs related to manual tool control, saving 
hundreds of unproductive hours a day, reducing errors and minimizing the amount of rework that was 
being done before. Production line stoppages have been reduced and cycle times to produce a car have 
significantly improved.

 Wi-Fi 
 
 
 “Space is big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, 
you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts 
to space.”   
 —Douglas Adams,  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy 
 Given how large the spaces are that we are called upon to help people navigate, it makes sense to 
leverage a type of infrastructure that is becoming more and more pervasive. 
 Wi-Fi isn’t just about connectivity; it can be used in a number of ways as part of a  Real Time Location 
System (RTLS) . In this section, we will look at the use of Wi-Fi access points to track the location of phones. 
In the next chapter, we will look at the opposite scenario, the phone monitoring the Wi-Fi access points to 
understand where it is. 

CHAPTER 16 ■ ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES TO BLUETOOTH BEACONS
300
 The  advantage of the access points monitoring the phone is that the phone doesn’t need to be running 
any particular app for this to work. This is a major advantage given that Gartner estimates that “less than 0.01 
percent of consumer mobile apps will be considered a financial success by their developers” 5 . Theoretically, 
every phone with its Wi-Fi radio enabled can be tracked from the access points in a venue. If only it were 
quite that simple. 
 In this section, we will look at a variety of the techniques used to enable location tracking via Wi-Fi 
access points (APs) and discuss some of the key vendors that have commercialized those techniques:
• 
 Cell of origin 
• 
  Active versus passive monitoring 
• 
  RSSI and angle of arrival 
• 
 802.11mc 
• 
 Wi-Fi tags 
• 
 Wi-Fi aware 
 Cell of Origin 
 While we will look at how vendors have been trying to improve the accuracy of Wi-Fi location systems using 
some very sophisticated techniques, the simplest level of location tracking can be quite effective, registering 
the presence of a phone in the range of a given Wi-Fi access point. If that access point is at the entrance to a 
venue, this may be enough to measure visits to the venue, or at least a representative sample of the visits. 
 The dwell time of the device, and by extension of that, the person using the device, can be measured. 
As more devices come within range we can get a sense of how crowded the area becomes over time. These 
numbers can be used to inform the staffing plans of a venue, to make sure high traffic times have adequate 
coverage. The duration that customers stay in a store and the correlation of these numbers to sales provides 
some useful metrics from a relatively crude measure of location. 
 Every Wi-Fi network device has a unique media access control (MAC) address, which is assigned by the 
manufacturer. The access point may track these addresses. If the access point sees the same MAC address 
more than once, this could be used to infer that a visitor has returned. This in turn, could be used as a 
measure of loyalty. On the other hand, if that MAC address is seen every day, it may not be a loyal customer; 
it may be that the person who owns the phone is an employee. 
 As a visitor moves deeper into a venue there will be a handoff to neighboring access points. From this 
we can get a departmental view of a visitors’ movements around the venue. Cisco’s CMX platform can be 
used to pull the data from multiple access points and provide a consolidated view of these numbers within a 
venue that could have hundreds of access points, even across multiple venues managed as a network. 
 Active Versus Passive  Monitoring 
 Just because a venue provides Wi-Fi, it doesn’t necessarily mean that visitors will use it. Not everyone 
entering a venue is going to take the time to search for a Wi-Fi network that is available and join it. This 
reality could make a significant dent in the proportion of phones we can track. 
 5 Gartner says less than 0.01 percent of consumer mobile apps will be considered a financial success by their developers 
through 2018; see    www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2648515  .

 Making sure the Wi-Fi service is fast and easy to join can help increase the number of visitors who use 
the service. This seems obvious, but you might be excused for thinking that it isn’t, given the challenges 
many of us suffer when trying to use Wi-Fi in some airports and other public places. The reality is that venue 
owners are generally aware of the frustration caused by slow Wi-Fi, but struggle to justify the costs of the 
bandwidth and infrastructure to fix the problem. This is a significant challenge if we want to piggyback on 
such a system for the purposes of using it for real-time location tracking. 
 Passive monitoring is the monitoring of phones that have Wi-Fi turned on, but haven’t joined the 
network. The prospect of tracking all phones with Wi-Fi turned on, rather than just those that joined a 
venue’s network, is appealing. Unfortunately, there are a few problems with passive monitoring. 
 Probe Requests 
 Smartphones, tablets, and laptops will periodically broadcast  Probe Request packets      to identify the wireless 
networks that are available. This isn’t a constant broadcast. Apple in particular has throttled back how often 
this is done by iOS. The frequency varies between releases of the same mobile operating system, but iOS 
8.1.3 has been measured to broadcast probe requests every 330 seconds, Android L 5.0.1 every 66 seconds. 6 
 This means that measuring the location of visitors using probe requests can be limited to measuring 
their presence in the store, but not their movements within it. A visitor can cover a lot of ground in a minute.  
 iOS MAC Address Randomization 
 The other significant issue that was seen as a threat to Wi-Fi analytics companies is that Apple now randomly 
changes the MAC addresses that iOS devices broadcast in their probe requests. This makes the measure of 
returning visitors with iPhones a lot harder if the device doesn’t associate with the network. It could also inflate 
the number of visitors reported. One visitor may look like three if their MAC address is rotated three times. 
 This problem doesn’t impact Android devices. Some Wi-Fi analytics vendors assert that Android 
handsets provide an adequate sample across socioeconomic and demographic segments and iOS handsets 
can simply be disregarded. 
 Euclid and the Nordstrom  Incident 
 The other issue is that some people don’t think it’s appropriate to monitor the presence of phone users 
passively. When we click through the terms and conditions that are between us and free Wi-Fi, we almost 
certainly give rights to the venue to track our every movement and maybe even to the life of our first born. 
However, people who have walked in off the street and have not joined the network have done no such thing. 
 Nordstrom was sucked into a controversy surrounding its use of Euclid Analytics to monitor customers 
passively.  Forbes magazine ran an article with the headline “How Nordstrom Uses Wi-Fi to Spy on Shoppers” 
in May of 2013. This despite the fact that Nordstrom had posted notices warning customers what they were 
doing. Shortly after the article was published, Nordstrom stopped using Euclid. 
 Years have passed since then and Euclid seems to be doing well. Maybe the arms race of oversharing on 
social media is changing the way new generations think of privacy 7 . Euclid’s list of customers has expanded, 
with over 65 brands using the service. They have succeeded in raising more funding, $20m for expansion. 
They partner with most of the major Wi-Fi access point providers, so activation of their service doesn’t 
require Wi-Fi upgrades.

 Euclid started with a vision of bringing Google Analytics capabilities to brick and mortar retailers. As 
new web savvy marketers join their ranks, retailers are accepting the need to blend their online and offline 
operations. Having analytics that can measure “bounce rate” 8  and other web style metrics in their stores is 
increasingly seen as part of that imperative. 
 Received Signal Strength Indication ( RSSI ) 
 By default, the location measurement performed with Wi-Fi analytics is done using RSSI, which is the same 
method as used with Bluetooth beacons 9 . The accuracy that is yielded is quite poor for the same reasons that 
impact beacons. The change in signal strength is quite significant when close to the device and much less 
so the farther the smartphone is from the access point. These differences can be lost in the noise that comes 
from interference, signal fluctuations, and multi-path effects. 
 In the case of Wi-Fi, these issues are compounded. The access points are generally placed in the ceiling, 
because they have to be configured for maximum connectivity and so they don’t have the opportunities for 
flexible configuration and placement that you have with beacons. With beacons, where accuracy is required, 
the device can be placed close to the point where measurement is required. The signal strength can be dialed 
down, or the density of beacons can be increased at a lot lower cost than can be done with Wi-Fi access points. 
 Wi-Fi proximity got a bad reputation for high expense and low accuracy when vendors prescribed 
increasing the density of the access points, which helped but didn’t return great results. One rule of thumb 
from Cisco is that RSSI will yield accuracy of 8-10 meters. 
 Trilateration 
 Wi-Fi analytics software can perform trilateration, which along with AP density, can help increase accuracy. 
Cisco has a mature Mobility Services Engine product, which is in at least its tenth version and can produce 
heatmaps and include beacons as a supplement to Wi-Fi. 
 Angle of Arrival 
 Similar angle of arrival techniques that we described being used by Quuppa in their Bluetooth product 
(see Chapter   7 on beacons) are used by a number of Wi-Fi vendors. 
 Cisco has a Halo, which is a hyperlocation module that can be used to upgrade a regular access point. 
Halo is a supplementary tubular, 32-part antenna that plugs into the regular access point and surrounds it 
with a halo. This comes at a cost. 
 The differences in signal phase coming from a phone are then compared across the 32 antenna 
elements, in order to compute the angle of arrival, and a much more accurate location estimate can then 
be delivered through trilateration. Cisco claims Halo can yield one to three meter accuracy. Grumbles from 
their field organization indicate the accuracy is closer to three meters than to one. Again, the addition of 
beacons to Halo can help. 
 8 Bounce rate on a web site is when a visitor to a home page stays briefly and then moves to another site. Euclid calculates 
bounce rate for retailers as someone leaving a store within five minutes of arriving, based on measuring their presence 
with Wi-Fi.  
 9 See Chapter   5 on standards for a discussion of RSSI. 

CHAPTER 16 ■ ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES TO BLUETOOTH BEACONS
303
 Ruckus Access points have a multi-part antenna, which according to its sales force is not used to 
calculate the angle of arrival, but could be used to better isolate the direction of the phone. It appears this 
isn’t done today and the multipart antenna is used in order to optimize connectivity and bandwidth using 
beamforming 10 . 
 Fine Time Measurement and IEEE 802.11mc 
 A response to the challenges with using Wi-Fi for precise location and the importance of improving those 
capabilities is coming in the form of a new Wi-Fi standard, IEEE 802.11mc. This should enable a significant 
improvement over techniques that use RSSI. Intel claims their chipsets will be able to achieve one to three 
meters accuracy with IEEE 802.11mc. Chips that support the new standard are available from many of the 
major chip vendors as of Q1 2106, and it’s expected that access points supporting the standard will ship later 
in that year. 
 These chipsets are designed to measure the time it takes for the radio packets to be sent between the 
access point and the mobile device and to estimate the distance that way. 
 Wi-Fi Tags 
 Our analysis of Wi-Fi has centered on retail and venues where the goal is to track smartphones, but Wi-Fi 
infrastructure has much broader applications for tracking objects other than phones. 
 A small number of companies are manufacturing Wi-Fi tags that are similar to the Bluetooth beacons 
we see being cranked out by hundreds of companies. Their cost is comparable to a mid- to high-end 
Bluetooth beacon. The application of these tags is typically for asset and people tracking. Ekahau and 
Stanley Healthcare (Stanley as in the Stanley knife) are two of the major vendors in this space. Stanley 
bought Aeroscout and integrated the tags into a broader suite of applications that helps optimize the 
operations of hospitals and other medical institutions. 
 The staff and patients can wear the tags to track their respective whereabouts. Babies and mothers can 
be automatically associated. The tags can maintain a two-way connection with the Wi-Fi access points to 
return sensor data on temperature, humidity, and motion. They can include buzzers and call buttons. 
 The tight integration with Stanley’s operational systems to monitor everything from staff movements, 
the finding of valuable medical equipment to hand washing, represents a competitive barrier to entry into 
the lucrative healthcare market for entrepreneurs considering beacons for similar applications.  
 Wi-Fi Aware:  Neighbor Awareness Networking 
 Wi-Fi Aware is an emerging standard defined by the Wi-Fi Alliance, the organization behind promoting 
Wi-Fi standards. Entrepreneurs developing Bluetooth beacons should have some awareness of Wi-Fi Aware. 
It’s starting to be supported in some Wi-Fi chipsets and has been talked of as a potential standard to enable a 
competing ecosystem of beacons. 
 The capabilities include proximity ranging and low power operation. Intel, Broadcom, Marvel, 
Mediatek, and Realtek have all produced chips that have been certified as being complaint with the new 
standard. It’s touted as being OS independent in what it does, but for developers to use it, iOS and Android 
will need to expose the functionality to developers. 
 10 With beamforming, rather than broadcasting a Wi-Fi signal in all directions (omnidirectional), an antenna directs the 
signal narrowly from the AP or beamformer, to the phone or beamformee. This minimizes interference and maximizes 
signal strength.  

CHAPTER 16 ■ ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES TO BLUETOOTH BEACONS
304
 Wi-Fi Aware has a lot more functionality than what would be required for beacon support. Another 
perspective on the standard is that it’s more of a competitor to LTE Direct 11 , in that it enables a set of 
peer-to-peer use-cases that enable communication between phones. Use-cases include peer-to-peer 
gaming and communication between phones in busy environments, where cell network and Wi-Fi networks 
are congested, bypassing the access points and cell towers, exchanging messages, media (photos at a game 
or a concert) and voice traffic directly between devices. Apple’s support could take the form of integration 
into Airdrop rather than as an alternative to beacons. It will be interesting to see if Google adds support 
for the technology in their Nearby API, which already supports audio as well as Bluetooth to implement 
proximity services. 
 Wi-Fi Direct may enable the likes of Stanley and Ekahau to enhance their products and may grow the 
segment they are in with beacons that communicate more efficiently with more hooks into the mobile 
operating systems. 
 Don’t Panic 
 It will be hard for Wi-Fi Aware tags to threaten the role of Bluetooth tags unless Apple enables these devices 
to awaken apps that are in background mode. This seems unlikely. Without this a Wi-Fi tag is not going 
to have the ability to drive proximity alerts in iOS. This capability underpins a large part of the Bluetooth 
beacon value in marketing and analytics applications. 
 Wi-Fi Summary: Wi-Fi versus Bluetooth  Beacons 
 Journalists love a fight, but the relative position of these two radio technologies in the Real Time Location 
Systems market is more nuanced and complex than the knock down drag-out fight that makes for a good 
headline. 
 Bluetooth beacon hooks into iOS and the ability to awaken apps is a cornerstone to beacon usage 
that will be hard to dislodge. The Bluetooth beacon ecosystem is large and diverse. Beacon costs are low. 
Features and functions are many. Every major Wi-Fi access provider we looked at is embracing Bluetooth 
beacons as another node in the networks that they can charge enterprises to manage. 
 Some, like Cisco, are incorporating beacons into their Wi-Fi positioning systems to increase accuracy at 
a lower cost and add more flexibility than can be achieved by increasing the density of access points. 
 Aruba dropped support for Wi-Fi as the basis for their Meridian RTLS system and completely switched 
to Bluetooth. Apparently this was because of the issues with having to associate with the Wi-Fi network, 
in order to track location effectively, the passive monitoring of Probe Requests issue and costs, accuracy, 
flexibility, and a perception that Bluetooth has a better privacy story. 
 On the other hand, with 802.11mc increasing the accuracy of the tracking of devices that are associated 
with the network, there is real value in leveraging this communications infrastructure that is already present 
in Wi-Fi networks. 
 The Wi-Fi providers have a strong motivation to claim their share of the revenue from beacon fleet 
management. They have a powerful installed base and a large trusted sales force. 
 It’s likely that Cisco, master of the business of acquisitions, will snatch up some bargains as the 
Bluetooth beacon startups with value to add run low on cash. So the blurring of the lines between these 
ecosystems could continue. 
 11 LTE Direct is a device-to-device technology using (telcos) licensed spectrum, bypassing the need to use cell towers for 
cell phones to communicate with each other. Information is exchanged using structured packets of data, enabling 
applications such as social networking, advertising, and gaming.

 The best way to ensure harmony between warring nations in centuries past was for the rulers to 
intermarry. If acquisitions are the business equivalent of that, we may see more love than war as these 
mergers take place. See Table  16-5 . 
 Summary 
 We have discussed some impressive technologies with which to build a real-time location solution. 
Between machine vision, LED lighting, magnetic resonance, Ultra Wide Band, and Wi-Fi, our toolbox 
seems pretty full. 
 We don’t have time or space to get into the details of another set of proximity and location tools: audio, 
ultrasound, and infrared, but they have their place. Maybe that place is deeper in the toolbox, but they 
are there. 
 Shazam uses audio as a way to bridge the digital and the physical worlds very successfully; Shopkick 
used ultrasonic beacons to authenticate user’s check-in to stores. They then moved to Bluetooth beacons as 
a lower cost, more secure solution. Infrared beacons are in the field, used as an option for asset tracking in 
Warren Buffet’s furniture warehouse stores. 
 But wait, there’s more. In the following chapters in this alternative technology section of the  Hitchhiker’s 
Guide to the Beacosystem, we will consider cellular networks, barcodes, QR codes, RFID, NFC, and GPS. 
 The thing that nearly all of these technologies have in common is that their usage, rather than being 
mutually exclusive to Bluetooth beacons, is often being blended with beacons to deliver the required user 
experience.

 CHAPTER 17  
 Geofencing: Everything You Need 
to Know 
 
 
 Patrick Leddy, Founder and CEO, Pulsate 
 In the race to become more connected with our customers, a company’s ability to build a “customer 
context stack” will define its overall success. 
 Hybridizing multiple customer data points from the virtual and physical worlds helps us understand 
the true expression of who customers are and what they are doing each and every moment. These “mobile 
moments” provide excellent opportunities to deepen the relationship and create value for both businesses 
and their customers. 

CHAPTER 17 ■ GEOFENCING: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW
308
 Inside the context  stack , there are many layers, from real-time CRM data to customer location and 
proximity, which were covered in great detail by my peers in other chapters.  
 This chapter is about geofencing and its role in the context stack; how it works, how you should 
implement a best practice solution, and how you can utilize it to influence customer behavior. 
 Geofences are  virtual perimeters  that mark locations in the physical world. Unlike their indoor cousins 
(beacons), geofences do not require the deployment of any physical hardware. 
 Geofencing comes in many forms and it is nearly as old as the mobile phone itself. In the beginning, 
mobile operators used cell tower identifiers to approximate the user’s physical location. 
 Early use-cases involved sending SMS marketing campaigns for brands, inventory tracking, and 
even law enforcement. Many a homicide case has been solved with the release of cell tower data from the 
operator, helping to place the suspect at the scene of the crime, or to prove their innocence. 
 This chapter focuses mostly on the marketing applications of geofencing. While mobile operators still 
offer geo-based SMS broadcasts, this is becoming less scaleable and, dare I say, even spammy. 
 Enter the App 
 The next generation of geofencing happens at a mobile app level. It does not involve the mobile operator 
directly and it combines a range of modern technologies and techniques to engage customers. App-level 
geofencing should respect the three Ps of mobile:  permission, privacy, and  preference . 
 Permission 
 Users need to actually download your mobile app. By downloading your app, they are signaling that they 
want to engage with your company on some level. In addition to downloading your app, in order for the 
geofencing component to work correctly, they need to give permission for location services to be turned on. 
 Privacy 
 Users should not be tracked persistently in the background. The locations visited prior to breaching the 
geofence are unknown. The mobile device’s operating system wakes up the app in the background only 
when users arrive at the geofence location. 
 Preference 
 The engagement should also be strictly on the users own terms. If you spam them with irrelevant 
communications, or if they feel you are misusing their data, they can easily revoke the location authorization 
or delete your app entirely. 
 Setting Up a Geofence 
 To set up a geofence, follow these steps:
 
 1. 
 Start by defining a physical location using a latitude, longitude, and radius 
around the location you want to geofence. 
 
 2. 
 Next, your mobile app should instruct the OS to monitor for this location. When 
the user arrives at that location, the OS immediately awakes the app and it can 
then take some kind of action.  

CHAPTER 17 ■ GEOFENCING: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW
309
 Once you have set up the  geofence , you need to consider the use-cases that you want to implement. The 
three types of action discussed in this chapter are engaging users at the point of entry (push notification), 
delaying the engagement for a period of time, and tracking the event for analytical purposes. 
 Before we deep dive into this at an implementation level, let’s examine some popular geofence 
use-cases and compare them with beacon use-cases. 
 Right Place, Time, and Message 
 The use-cases described next are by no means an exhaustive list, but rather a few solid ideas to get you 
started. 
 Promote, Incentivize, and Reward 
 Geofences can be an excellent way of reminding customers about a promotion while they are in the area. 
Previously, you may have sent a push notification earlier in the week with a coupon or some kind of offer, so 
now is the time to remind them to pay you a visit.
 “Physically interacting at the right place and time with immediate value builds loyalty 
and drives sales.” 
 You can also use a technique known as  random intermittent reinforcement      . The idea is to reward the 
customers with a treat when they are nearby. Customers perceive this as a random act of kindness and are 
incentivized to visit your location. 
 There is no mention in the app of this seemingly random event so it is a surprise for the customer 
and they don’t expect it every time. Of course, it’s not random at all, because you base this heavily on 
segmentation data and rules. For example, one potential segment to target with such a campaign could be, 
“high-value customers who have not transacted in 30 days and are in the area right now”. When you bring 
personalization and CRM data into this at scale (a calibrated treat for each customer), it can drive significant 
foot traffic to your location. 
 Stamp Out Promiscuous Behavior 
 Geofences are completely virtual; you can place them anywhere in the world. This is where it gets 
interesting. As part of your geofencing strategy you might want to consider geofencing  competitor locations . 
Knowing when and how often “loyal” customers frequent competitors can add an incredible new dimension 
to your engagement strategy. 
 However, sending cheeky push notifications to customers as they arrive at a competitor’s location might 
be crossing the “freaky” line. If you must interject, put a delay on these communications so that it happens 
later in the day and not while the customer is still at the location. An even better approach is to process this 
as an analytic event and feed it back into the overall customer view. 
 Later, you can segment customers who visited competitors versus your own locations and compute 
an internal loyalty score. The campaigns that you run against different cohorts can be calibrated based on 
this score; promiscuous customers get different offers and communications to try to modify their previous 
behavior. 

CHAPTER 17 ■ GEOFENCING: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW
310
 Remind Them the Right Way 
 When you connect your CRM and loyalty system with the rest of your mobile strategy, don’t forget to remind 
customers how many points they have and when they expire. Do this via a  push notification when they 
arrive at your geofence. Bonus points if you can highlight products the customer is interested in at the 
same time. 
 Spike Feelings of Accomplishment 
 If your app features a check-in function, which is essentially enabling your customers to tell their social 
media following that they are at XYZ company’s location, make sure to remind them of this function with 
a push notification upon arrival at the location. Don’t forget to incentivize this with extra points, unlocking 
some Easter egg within the app such as social status or some kind of virtual currency.    Spiking feelings of 
accomplishment and helping the customer convey their status are two of the most powerful emotional 
loyalty switches that you can flip inside a customer’s mind. 
     Ask Them How They Feel 
 When a customer leaves a geofence around your location, you could delay sending them a communication 
by an hour and then ask them about their experience of  visiting your company on that day. Remember to 
also provide an incentive for completing the survey. The customer is on a mobile device so keep it short and 
ask multiple choice questions rather than forcing them to type answers.  
 Regional Campaigns 
 Location-based marketing is like a Russian doll. The outer layers, the big dolls, can be defined by geofences. 
As you peel back the layers and approach the center, beacons come into play. 
 Large geofence perimeters may be used to segment regional campaigns. If the Superbowl is being 
played in Miami, a geofence around Florida may be appropriate to encourage local fans to buy tickets for 
the event. However, such messaging may not be appropriate in other states that have no connection to that 
year’s Superbowl. 
 Campaigns that are targeted at regions such as the West Coast can be focused simply on the relevant 
users within a geofence, capturing large portions of the user base that will most likely be far from any 
beacons that you might use for closer proximity marketing. 
 Remind Them to Turn On  Bluetooth 
 Even though Bluetooth beacons have given us an incredible ability to target users on an extremely micro 
level, they become useless when the customer has Bluetooth switched off. The number of customers that 
have Bluetooth powered on hovers at around the 30% mark for the United States and can be dramatically 
lower in other counties. 
 Geofences and beacons are complementary in a range of scenarios, especially when you use a geofence 
to encourage a user to switch Bluetooth on. If you geofence a location that also contains beacons, it is a good 
idea after fence entry to check the current Bluetooth status of every device. If it is set to off, you could surface 
a reminder. “Hi Joe, just a quick reminder to turn on Bluetooth to experience in-store treats and rewards.” 
The most important thing to remember is that you can use geofences to give customer’s concrete reasons to 
switch Bluetooth on. 

CHAPTER 17 ■ GEOFENCING: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW
311
 The Battle of the Location  Technologies 
 When you design location-based use-cases, it is probable that more often than not you will use multiple 
technologies, beacons, and geofences together in harmony to achieve your goal. Let’s begin by comparing 
the advantages and drawbacks of each technology. 
 Beacons are a reliable technology once Bluetooth is powered on. They are generally used indoors for 
understanding very granular proximities. On the other hand, geofences depend on having Wi-Fi turned on 
(to improve accuracy) and can cover very large areas. We can also geofence competitor locations, which 
is not possible in most cases with beacons. When it comes to understanding customers inside a building, 
geofences aren’t very helpful because they generally cover large areas of 100 meters and above. Steel and 
concrete in buildings can also disrupt the radio signals we use to deliver geofence messaging.

 Reliable

 Deployment lead-time 
 It’s clear from this comparison that these two technologies are used for very different reasons and can 
be used to complement each other. 
 You should approach the design  of  location-based use-cases by thinking about customer context and 
journey. Each customer’s journey usually starts long before she walks through your door, and therefore you 
can divide use-cases into inside the building and outside the building activities. Geofences are excellent 
for engaging with customers before they reach your location and they can, in fact, be the reason why some 
customers are visiting your location in the first place. 
 If geofences are the key driver of foot traffic to a location, beacons are the key enablers of engagement 
after users enter that location. Where geofences can help identify users within 300 meters of a store and 
invite them inside, beacons offer greater granularity in terms of what product the customer might be 
standing beside. Neither geofences nor beacons alone represent a silver bullet for engagement, they are 
merely the trigger event. Your orchestration layer in conjunction with CRM data needs to be clever enough 
to start interesting and engaging conversations with customers based on these trigger events. 

CHAPTER 17 ■ GEOFENCING: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW
312
 All Geofences Are Not Created Equal 
 Whether you build your own geofence solution in-house or use a third-party solution, it is important to 
note that many providers have different definitions of what geofencing is and how it should work. There are 
two main types of geofencing solutions that you can build or buy and each comes with its own time, cost, 
accuracy, and availability implications. 
 We have provided a checklist at the end of the chapter that outlines what you should aim for when 
building or buying a geofencing solution. The methods listed next are solutions achievable across both 
iPhone and Android smartphones. 
 Active 
 Only works when the App is open. Implementation difficulty: Medium. 
 The user has your app open and the app initializes the GPS radio to get high-accuracy latitude and 
longitude of the user’s current location. You then determine if the user’s position is inside or outside a list of 
predetermined locations held either inside the app itself locally or stored remotely on a server. 
 If you are building an active geofence solution, it is desirable to send location events (when the app is 
open) to the server to be checked against the database. The benefits of this are two fold. First, it allows you 
to add new geofences remotely without needing to update your app. Second, it shifts the processing power 
requirements away from the mobile device to the server, which is usually far more powerful. 
 You will need to build logic within your server component that takes the location event from the mobile 
device, with the latitude and longitude, and computes it against the list of geofences (latitude, longitude, 
and radius) stored in the database to determine if the user is inside or outside of the geofence. While 
describing this logic in detail is outside the scope of this chapter, one idea might be to base your data store 
on MongoDB; a popular NoSQL database technology that makes it easier than ever to compute location data 
in a performant and scalable way. 
 Once you have implemented your active geofencing solution, you now have the ability to very 
accurately determine if a user is inside or outside of specific locations. This is an accuracy that passive 
geofencing cannot compete with. As GPS data is being used here, you can create incredibly small geofences, 
sometimes as small as 10 meters, and reliably determine if users are inside or outside of these locations and 
take resulting action based on that. 
 There is one major caveat with this implementation: users must have the app open on their screens 
and be “actively” using it for you to determine if they are inside the geofence or not. Depending on your 
use-case and business goals, this might be a perfectly acceptable tradeoff. However, in our experience 
most of the companies we have worked with do not like this approach. Their use-cases depended on 
engaging customers as they pass by, or tracking them when they visit a competitor. We can’t rely on users 
coincidentally having our app open at the exact moment they enter one of our fences. Therefore, active 
geofencing can be a good way of understanding where customers are after they arrive and if they are likely 
to use your app as part of a visit to your location but it is not a suitable method to drive foot traffic, track 
competitors, or to achieve the use-cases described earlier in this chapter. 
 It is therefore surprising that quite a number of geofencing solutions on the market only allow what 
is termed as  active geofencing . If you are implementing this method you should only request one high-
accuracy location update (GPS). Do this immediately when the app opens, and then shut down any further 
location updates to minimize power usage. Requesting high-accuracy location updates makes heavy use of 
the GPS radio, one of the most battery-intensive tasks on a mobile device. 

CHAPTER 17 ■ GEOFENCING: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW
313
 Passive 
 Works when app is open, closed, and even terminated. Difficulty level: Hard. 
 Passive geofencing is a different animal entirely and while it doesn’t produce the same accuracy as 
the “active” method, it does work in the background. This means your app can be closed or terminated out 
of memory. The phone can be in your pocket and the screen darkened. This presents obvious advantages 
over the “active” method, as it does not rely on the users having the app open at the point that they enter a 
geofence. 
 The only tradeoff is that we cannot be as accurate as with the “active” method. Passive fencing generally 
won’t let you create geofences smaller than 100 meters. 
 So why the difference in accuracy? Generally speaking, the passive method uses very little or no GPS 
data (a very different approach to active) and instead relies on a combination of cellular and Wi-Fi data. 
 As we cannot rely on our app being open (it may even have been terminated by the user), we must 
enlist the support of some native operating system APIs to help us out. iOS comes with an API as part of 
CoreLocation called  RegionMonitoring (the same API we use to monitor for beacons). Before beacons were 
even invented, developers could ask the RegionMonitoring API to monitor for a geofence by providing it 
with a latitude, longitude, and radius. 
 The app can then go to sleep without fear of being terminated, comfortable in the knowledge that the 
iOS will wake the app back up (in the background) and tell it if any of the geofences that you are monitoring 
for have been breached. The app can then take a resulting action such as surfacing a local notification or a 
piece of content because it knows that the fence has been breached. More advanced mobile marketing SDKs 
could take the geofence entry event from the OS and then network out to an API. From there, a web-based 
platform could ingest the geofence event, check who the users are, determine their segments and frequency 
caps, and then decide whether to send a campaign. 
 As part of iOS and Android’s normal operation, they constantly connect to cell towers and scan for 
available Wi-Fi networks. The native geofencing APIs mentioned previously leverage existing device 
services, meaning that they do not cause any additional battery drain. The OS manufacturers have a 
database of where each cell tower is physically located. When your phone is connecting to a cell tower to 
maintain network, it is very easy for the phone to become location-aware. The cell tower data will give a 
location in terms of several hundred meters of accuracy, but when Wi-Fi data is brought into the mix, things 
get a lot more accurate. 
 iPhone and Android devices actually crowdsource the plotting of Wi-Fi networks or specific SSIDs 
to very accurate latitudes and longitudes. When an iPhone or Android device sees an SSID not previously 
known to Apple or Google, the operating system will fire up GPS in the background and tag the location of 
that SSID and then send it back to the Google or Apple database. 
 When we enlist the help of the native geofence APIs on the device, it is combining the cell towers that it 
sees along with what Wi-Fi networks it encounters. Note that you don’t have to be connected to these Wi-Fi 
networks; this is ambient scanning of available Wi-Fi in the vicinity of the user’s device. As practically all 
Wi-Fi SSIDs have previously been location tagged, it’s very easy for the OS to know where it is located and 
determine if any geofences have been breached. 
 As Wi-Fi data is heavily employed for passive geofencing, we generally advise that geofencing does not 
work accurately if Wi-Fi is turned off on the device (which will be a portion of your user base). In nearly all 
cases, you will not see a geofence event callback from OS when Wi-Fi is turned off. In rare situations, the user 
might open another app that uses GPS data. In these cases, the OS will take the more accurate GPS data used 
by that other app and could use that to determine that the user is inside a geofence. 
 At first glance, the passive method seems like an attractive option. With the built-in native APIs you tell 
the OS where you want to geofence, it wakes up your app at the right time and place with all the heavy lifting 
taken care of. Simple, right? 
 Unfortunately, it is not that straightforward. While you might get some encouraging results in proof of 
concept mode, you will run into problems as you scale. There are some underlying peculiarities or bugs with 
the way these native geofencing APIs  perform. 

CHAPTER 17 ■ GEOFENCING: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW

 Working with iOS 
 If you are implementing geofencing on iOS, you need to be aware of certain issues and limitations of the 
native APIs. 
 Bursting 
 iOS has an issue that happens when monitoring for multiple geofences. The effect is that intermittently you 
will get callbacks for every geofence you are monitoring for, even though of course you cannot be in 20 places 
at once. If you want to test this for yourself, launch the native Reminders app on iOS (it uses the same API), 
add a bunch of tasks, and then tag them against locations. Usually you will get reminded of each task as you 
approach the correct location. Every so often, however, you will get notifications for all of the tasks at the same 
moment.  
 False Alarms 
 On occasion, the operating system will report you as being at a geofence that could be several miles away. 
Your phone can connect to cell towers over great distances, and occasionally, it might make a momentary 
connection to a tower that is far away. In the absence of the ambient Wi-Fi data to verify your location, this 
seems to trick Region Monitoring into thinking you are in the wrong location. 
 Circles  Only 
 The native geofencing APIs allow you to define only circular geofences so you cannot create a polygonal 
boundary around a rectangular area. 
 20 Geofences Limit 
 You are limited to monitoring for 20 geofences at the same time with the native geofencing APIs and this is 
a big constraint if you have a lot of locations. This frustrated us for some time until we came up with a better 
way of doing it. The solution is pretty straightforward, so we will detail it here. 
 Solving the  20 Fence Limit 
 The trick is to pull down a list of geofence locations you want to monitor for, ideally from a remote server. 
Then, pass the latitude, longitude, and radius of the nearest 1,000 fences (for example) to that user. One 
thousands fences is quite a lot, so it could be all of the fences for that state or country. You should then store 
the 1,000 locations locally, putting 20 of the nearest locations into Region Monitoring memory slots. 
 At that point you should instrument another native iOS API called SignificantChange Location. This 
wakes up the app (in the background) with every cell tower change as the user moves through a location. 
The OS gives us the nearest approximate location (latitude and longitude). The app is now awake in the 
background following the cell tower change. You should use the user’s new location and the Haversine 
formula (Google it) to calculate the nearest 20 geofence locations to the user’s current location. 
 At that point, swap the nearest 20 fences into Region Monitoring’s memory and repeat the process for 
every cell tower change. This means that you will be constantly monitoring for the nearest 20 geofences. 
Using SignificantChange Location will not cause additional battery drain because the OS has to handle cell 
tower change events as part of its normal operation. 

CHAPTER 17 ■ GEOFENCING: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW
315
 Working with Android 
 If you are implementing geofencing on Android, you need to be aware of certain issues and limitations of the 
native APIs. 
 Limits and Power Use 
 Android supports 100 geofences per app (the more geofences the greater the power usage, so it’s smart to 
load less than 100 geofences and update the geofence list every 1km). 
 Sensor Usage 
 For Android geofencing, you should use the Fused Location API and Geofencing API. The Fused Location 
API uses GPS, Wi-Fi, cell towers, and phone sensors. Data from sensors can help reduce power consumption 
because we do not need to request location updates while the user is not moving.  
 Accuracy and Intervals 
 Priority:
• 
 PRIORITY_HIGH_ACCURACY —Use this setting to request the most precise location 
possible. With this setting, the location services are more likely to use GPS (Global 
Positioning System) to determine the location. 
• 
 PRIORITY_BALANCED_POWER_ACCURACY —Use this setting to request location precision 
to within a city block, which is an accuracy of approximately 100 meters. This is 
considered a coarse level of accuracy and is likely to consume less power. With this 
setting, the location services are likely to use Wi-Fi and cell tower positioning. Note, 
however, that the choice of location provider depends on many other factors such as 
what sources are available. 
• 
 PRIORITY_LOW_POWER —Use this setting to request city-level precision, which is 
an accuracy of approximately 10 kilometers. This is considered a coarse level of 
accuracy and is likely to consume less power.  
• 
 PRIORITY_NO_POWER —Use this setting if you require negligible impact on power 
consumption and still want to receive location updates when available. With this 
setting, your app does not trigger any location updates, but receives locations 
triggered by other apps. 
 The  Interval method sets the rate in milliseconds at which your app prefers to receive location 
updates. Note that the location updates may be faster than this rate if another app is receiving updates at a 
faster rate, or slower than this rate, or there may be no updates at all (if the device has no connectivity, for 
example).

 Geofence  Vendor Checklist 
 Whether you are thinking of building or buying, the following checklist should serve as a shopping list to 
create a reliable, accurate, and scalable solution: 
 Should not require the deployment of hardware 
 Should work passively, when the screen is off, and when the app is closed and even terminated 
 Should not use GPS in background modes 
 Should not create excessive battery drain 
 Can be managed and updated remotely 
 Should provide for better accuracy and reliability above and beyond default operating system APIs 
 Should overcome known issues with default system APIs 
 Summary 
 Geofencing is an incredible way to target customers. When blended with CRM data and real-time data 
segmentation, we can begin to understand customer context in the exact moment. Geofences placed nicely 
with beacons allow us to drive foot traffic to the location, then allow the beacons to do their job of delivering 
more granular context. You need to think about what use-cases are important for your business. 
 Finally, in building your geofencing solution, you need to decide what your business objectives are and 
what trade-offs active versus passive (accuracy versus availability) you are willing to make. Do you need high 
accuracy when the users have the app open, or do you need to wake the app up when users are broadly in 
your area? Only you can decide, based on your own unique use-cases.

 Barcodes, QR Codes, NFC, 
and RFID 
 
 
 Theresa Mary Gordon and Steve Statler 
 In this chapter we will review several proximity technologies that enable automated identification of physical 
objects and provide alternatives to Bluetooth beacons:
• 
 Barcode and QR (Quick Response) code technologies, which enable interactions 
with tags that are “in sight” 
• 
 Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Near Field Communication (NFC), which 
enable interactions with radios that are generally “in reach” but may be out of sight 

CHAPTER 18 ■ BARCODES, QR CODES, NFC, AND RFID 
318
 We will outline and compare their various functions with regard to consumer marketing and business 
applications. 
 Each technology provides a different trigger for communication, object identification, data collection, 
and dissemination or experience customization. 
 Criteria for Comparison: One of These Things Is Not Like 
the Other… 
 The key criteria we will use to compare these technologies are:
• 
 Distance—How far or close does an object need to be to work 
• 
 Device or application—What do you need to have or can you use to collect and 
decipher the information 
• 
 Visibility—Does the object need to be in sight or in reach of the device 
 Based on these straightforward factors, we will analyze the traits and values of RFID, NFC, barcodes, 
and QR codes. We will see how these impact deployment and adoption of each, and will then outline, in 
more detail, the amount and types of data they can each hold. Finally, we will look at costs associated with 
each and some specific business use-cases. 
 A Quick Overview 
 Barcodes (Figure  18-1 ) were the first commercially distributed system created to automate  the  decoding of 
a number from an image in order to identify a product. Dedicated scanners were originally required to read 
the codes. These projected a light (sometimes a laser) onto the barcode and read the reflected light with a 
photosensor that was “scrubbed” over the image. 
 RFID radios are embedded in devices and tags and can often resemble a paper sticker. Under the 
surface, they have a metallic layer that is a radio antenna and a tiny integrated circuit (IC) (see Figure  18-2 ). 
The IC stores and processes the data to be transmitted, collects the electrical power over the air (from the 
RFID reader signal, which provides enough energy to transmit the code back to the reader), and creates the 
radio frequency (RF) signal for the transmission.

 Both barcodes and RFID tags are applied to objects so they can quickly be scanned, identified, and 
tracked so that the information can be shared digitally. 
 However, barcodes are a “line of sight”  technology . They may provide a similar function as RFID tags, 
but they need to be seen by a reader to provide data. RFID only needs to be in reach to engage a reader. 
 Both barcodes and RFID tags have evolved offspring with enhanced and specialized functionality. They 
have “begat” the QR code (Figure  18-3 ) and NFC tag, respectively.

 QR codes are also a line of sight technology. They need to be seen by a reader to provide data. You can 
read the QR code in Figure  18-3 with Scan (   www.scan.me  1 ), one of the many apps available on Apple’s App 
Store and Google Play that reads QR codes. QR codes are basically  two-dimensional barcodes . They were 
initially deployed in Japanese car manufacturing and gained wider adoption due to their increased capacity 
to store information and the speed with which they can be read compared to one-dimensional codes. 
 NFC (Figure  18-4 ) is based on RFID technology, with a restricted range of up to 10 centimeters. 
Its applications have been standardized around a set of use-cases that are simple and easy to execute. 
Unlike RFID, NFC is supported by most smartphones, although Apple has restricted NFC on the iPhone 
to only work with Apple Pay. NFC’s sweet spot is use for payments, setting up other wireless connections, 
identification and access tokens, social networking, smartphone task automation, and smart poster manual 
check-in (see Figure  18-5 ).

Scan.me company, they instantly made QR codes a lot cooler. A unique Snapchat Snapcode is associated with each 
user’s profile. Snapchat users can follow each other by scanning these icons, which can be printed on posters and T-shirts 
and added to web pages.

CHAPTER 18 ■ BARCODES, QR CODES, NFC, AND RFID 
323
 Barcodes 
 Barcodes were developed to solve a problem in the grocery industry. Stores were in need of a way to speed 
up the checkout process, and the solution sought was a way to tag items to enable them to be scanned and 
 processed quickly. A faster checkout allows for lower levels of staffing while maintaining shorter lines, which 
leads to higher customer satisfaction and retention. 
 As with most new technologies, the path to the market was not linear and involved years of 
development, experimenting with circular codes, different inks, printing technologies, and scanner systems. 
Insights were also gleaned from a similar solution called KarTrak ACI that was deployed in the railroad 
industry to label train cars. It is said that the first true deployment of barcodes in retail began with the 
scanning of a pack of Wrigley’s gum in a supermarket in Ohio in June of 1974. 
 Since then, a variety of different techniques that govern the way characters are encoded using changes 
in the relative size and spacing of the lines within barcodes have been developed. These are known as 
 symbologies , and each is designed for a specific use-case and business vertical. 
 Barcode  Symbologies 
 For example, Universal Product Code (UPC) barcodes are the barcodes we see in the grocery store and on 
retail products that are used for checkout and inventory. A UPC contains 12 numeric digits. There are also 
postnet barcodes, which the U.S. Postal Service uses for ZIP codes; maxicodes, which the United Parcel 
Service (UPS) uses and are both vertical and horizontal and contain up to 93 alphanumeric characters; 
Optical Character Recognition (OCR-A and OCR-B) barcodes, which are human-readable versions of codes; 
and Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR), which is a special font for bank checks. 
 Barcode  Scanners 
 As there are different symbologies, there are also a variety of types of scanners. One that should be familiar 
to all of us is the barcode reader, also called a point-of-sale (PoS) scanner, which can be a handheld or 
stationary input device. 
 The stationary versions—the laser scanners embedded in the flow desk of checkout systems—use lasers 
that are optimized for reading barcodes that may be positioned at odd angles or difficult to read with other 
systems, such as if the printing has become smudged or damaged. 
 The handheld scanners found more commonly at convenience stores and in some other retail 
categories are being switched to optical scanners that don’t require the code to be scrubbed past. This is 
being driven because the laser scanner cannot read barcodes or QR codes displayed on phones, a need that 
is becoming increasingly more common. 
 When enterprises develop coupon, membership, or payment systems that rely on the entry of a code at 
the points-of-sale, they need to be aware of whether the PoS has laser scanners or optical scanners. Trying to 
read barcodes of any kind on phone screens with a laser scanner will not work. 
 UPC  Codes  
 When creating a product that needs to be scanned at PoS systems across multiple retailers, it will be 
necessary to purchase Universal Product Code (UPC) codes. Not all products require UPC codes. Consider 
your local fast food store, where the product range is limited and PoS are configured with a button per 
product. Your coffee and croissant don’t need to be scanned. Purchasing and maintaining a UPC prefix, a 
barcode from the GS-1, can be quite expensive. GS-1 is a neutral, not-for-profit, international organization 

CHAPTER 18 ■ BARCODES, QR CODES, NFC, AND RFID 
324
that oversees, develops, and maintains standards for barcodes for use in supply chains across multiple 
industries. The cost can range from $250 up to $10,000+ for unique barcodes depending on how many you 
need. There is also an annual renewal fee for participation in the GS1 that can range from $50 to $2,100. 
 These, and hardware costs for readers, are key operational costs in the consumer, health, and retail 
industries. 
 Quick Response Codes 
 For the many companies who had successfully deployed one-dimensional barcodes as part of their 
inventory and point-of-sale process, moving to two-dimensional QR codes for messaging or marketing did 
not take a particularly big leap of faith. Barcodes were already being scanned at checkout to collect product 
information and speed up the process, so maybe with QR codes this same approach could be used to work 
for other purposes as well, as we will see later. 
 The patterns of square dots arranged in a grid used for QR codes, in addition to having advantages 
of speed and capacity over one-dimensional codes, incorporate redundancy and error correction. This 
helps to deal with the wear and tear of codes that are damaged in people’s purse, wallet, or warehouse. The 
additional  dimension  also permits more creative presentation with other embedded images being added to 
the QR code and the presentation of the codes in different colors. 
 For our purposes, QR codes are similar to beacons in that a consumer or end user must have an app to 
interact with them. With a beacon, Bluetooth must be on and a beacon-enabled app must be downloaded. 
With QR codes, the user must have the QR-enabled app downloaded on their phone to collect and decipher 
the data from the image. 
 Cost  Effective 
 QR codes are a cost-effective technique because they are easily created and printed on a surface for 
distribution, often being incorporated into existing print materials. Additionally, QR code creation tools are 
often free. 
 All QR Codes Are Not Equal 
 The more data that needs to be encoded in the QR code, the more complex the image and the finer the 
resolution of the dots in the grid. This makes for a  less  robust QR code, one that can be harder to read and 
has less resilience to scratches and other distortion. So despite the greater capacity in the QR code, solution 
designers tend to try to reduce the amount of information that has to be encoded.  
 All QR Code Apps Are Not Equal Either 
 Image recognition is a complicated process that relies on both the app’s coding and the device’s software 
and hardware. These variables can make it difficult to optimize the recognition and scanning process across 
the board, so some apps may work better than others based on which device you use. For example, a QR 
scanning app that takes advantage of a camera phone’s autofocus feature may not work as well on an older, 
cheaper phone that lacks an autofocus. The capabilities and limitations of both devices and apps are worth 
considering when designing solutions. 

CHAPTER 18 ■ BARCODES, QR CODES, NFC, AND RFID 
325
 The  Human Dependency 
 Encouraging consumers to download a third-party app to read a QR code is easier said than done. Knowing 
which app to use and when to use them can be confusing for customers. 
 Any time a system relies on staff or customers to do something, we are creating an obstacle to success. 
With all the advantages of low cost and the ubiquity of camera phones, that extra step required to read QR 
codes may seem trivial, but it is actually quite significant. For the QR code to trigger properly, a consumer 
must have or get the appropriate QR app, scan the QR code by aligning the device, scanner, or mobile 
phone directly in the line of sight of the image and then the reader must see the QR code image. Unless the 
consumer is given reason to believe the content will be of particular interest, it is likely that they won’t be 
bothered. 
 Compatibility 
 Not all QR codes are readable by all apps. There are over 100 different QR apps, and QR codes are not the 
only type of 2D barcode formats. There are also formats like DataMatrix, ScanLife Ezcode, and Microsoft Tag 
(Tag). Some formats are open source and widely recognized, while others have their own proprietary reader. 
 Looks Matter 
 While the technologists among us may see beauty in a barcode or QR code, marketing professionals 
don’t always agree. The perception that QR Codes are ugly has proved a barrier to their deployment in 
merchandising materials. 
 Fortunately, since QR codes are  so  robust and can be decoded even when elements are lost or distorted, 
this has opened up artistic possibilities.  Imaginative artistic renditions of   QR codes have turned the “ugly” 
problem into an opportunity. QR codes can be rendered in color, have logos embedded in them, and have 
the pixels generally messed with, all to artistic effect. This has yielded a blood red QR code, rotated by 45 
degrees with blood dripping from it, to advertise the True Blood TV series. Other examples include jigsaw 
pieces being embedded in the code to promote an Autism charity, and changes to the shape of the pixels in 
the code so that the image looks more like an impressionist painting. 
 Microsoft Tag   is another format that allows for customized and artistic codes. Their custom tool allows 
users to generate codes that can incorporate a wide variety of artistic designs.  
 Examples 
 Companies like Walmart, Heinz, Home Depot, Sephora, and McDonald’s are some of the brands that have 
deployed and continue to use QR codes to  provide  relevant product information and marketing campaigns. 
Walmart has used them to run back-to-school clothing offers, while Sephora has used them to promote 
lipstick. QR codes have even been used on Heinz ketchup bottles to support cause marketing, and Home 
Depot deployed them to convey instructions on how to care for greenhouse plants. 
 McDonald’s uses QR codes in its packaging at 14,000 U.S. restaurants. A QR code links you to a product’s 
nutritional information with a simple click. 
 Challenges 
 While QR codes have arguably brought beauty, speed, and robustness to barcode scanning, we shouldn’t 
ignore the challenges inherent in the approach. 

CHAPTER 18 ■ BARCODES, QR CODES, NFC, AND RFID 
326
 How often have we heard the complaint, “It’s not scanning!”? There are numerous possible reasons for 
this. Maybe the user doesn’t have the right app. If you are scanning a QR code on a phone, maybe the screen 
isn’t bright enough. Are you using a laser scanner to read a QR code on a phone? Is there enough light in 
the room? Did the image get wet or smeared? Or maybe an incoming message blocked the display of the QR 
code on the screen. 
 These are some of the issues to consider with the use of QR codes. So with that in mind, let’s look at 
another technology that can address a number of these potential problems: RFID. 
 RFID 
 RFID can be seen as the “evolved” form of barcode technology;  the  wireless version. RFID was one of the 
first forms of contactless technology and is currently in widespread use and is still growing. It is similar to a 
barcode in that an RFID tag is attached to an object and then has to be scanned and read so the contents of 
the tag can be known. It is dissimilar in that it does not have to be seen or aligned with the reader to work. 
 The RFID system consists of small radios embedded in devices and tags that provide information to 
the RFID reader. RFID tags can be embedded or stored in, not just applied to, the objects being tracked. The 
viability of these storing methods will be influenced by the read range of RFID tags, which will vary based on 
many factors. In some systems, tags can be read from 100 feet, in others it can be as little as ten centimeters. 
 Tagging is the RFID process where a small microchip is attached to an  antenna   to create a unique 
“tag” or label. The antenna enables the chip that stores the unique ID and information on it to be read 
from a long distance. An RFID tag or label produces a signal that “sends” information to a digital receiver 
without needing to come into contact or be seen by that receiver, thus creating a contactless way to provide 
individual IDs for physical objects. Every tag/label becomes an entry point for engagement and distributing 
information, while the receiver becomes the solitary collection point. 
 RFID communication is often one-way only, meaning that the reader can only read from the tag and 
can’t modify its electronic content. However, it can be two-way with the right setup. RFID tags create a 
 many-to-one system , where information from many “tagged” objects is read by one reader or endpoint and 
converted to digital data. For example, E-ZPass and other toll systems use RFID. The E-ZPass readers are the 
single collection point that reads the individual identification information stored on the many E-ZPasses 
located in the many individual vehicles that drive by. 
 RFID Radios:  Active ,  Passive ,  or  Semi-Passive 
 RFID systems are based on three primary radio wave frequencies: low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), 
and ultra-high frequency (UHF). These operating frequencies are 135KHz, 13.56MHz, 2.45GHz, 5.8GHz, 860 
to 960MHz, and 433MHz. NFC (Near Field Communication) operates at 13.56MHz. 
 RFID tags can be active, passive, or semi-passive based on power. Each has unique standards governing 
them and, as of now, passive UHF RFID is the only type regulated by a single global standard, UHF Gen 2. 
Standards promote growth and help ensure consistency in development and deployment across industries. 
 Active RFID tags have a transmitter and power source, usually a battery. Passive tags do not have their 
own power source and are read one-way from the tag to the reader. The reader powers the chip and antenna 
(electronics) in the tag through the electromagnetic signal it transmits. Semi-passive tags use a battery to run 
the tag’s electronics that may include sensors such as a temperature monitor. The transmitter itself works 
the same way as a passive tag and is powered by the reader signal. Both passive and semi-passive tags have a 
shorter range and slower transmission speed as compared to the active tag (of the order of 10 feet versus 100 
feet for an active tag). 
 Active RFID tags can be powered on when they receive a radio signal from a reader and respond by 
signaling back. This allows them to conserve power since they do not necessarily radiate radio transmissions 
until they receive a reader signal. 

CHAPTER 18 ■ BARCODES, QR CODES, NFC, AND RFID 
327
 RFID needs a reader and does not communicate directly with mobile devices. However, a great example 
of complementary crossover development with RFID is a Bluetooth UHF RFID reader by Technology 
Solutions UK Ltd (TSL). It uses Bluetooth to allow mobile devices to communicate with a variety of UHF 
RFID host devices. 
 RFID Storage  Capacity 
 RFID tags have more capacity than barcode labels in regard to the amount of data they can hold. The 
amount an RFID tag can hold varies by type of tag and tag vendor, with a typical RFID tag being capable of 
holding 2KB of data. RFID tags can also be programmed and reprogrammed, which gives them an edge over 
barcodes and QR codes that must be reprinted to accommodate changes. 
 RFID  Applications 
 The RFID wireless tag and reader process is very efficient for cataloging and monitoring inventory across 
the supply chain, and for tracking multiple, high-volume items and activities quickly. This provides a 
cost-effective way to collect and manage information (IDs and data) from many assets and activities to one 
central collection point for analysis, insights, and actionable data. 
 RFID is used across industries for everything from inventory accuracy, shrinkage reduction, and loss 
prevention to authenticating people with their ID badges, improving processes, and even ensuring patient 
safety. For example, the University of Vermont Medical Center in Burlington, Vermont, used RFID to reliably 
track five million medications from ordering through dispensing.  
 RFID  Tag Placement 
 The fact that RFID does not require line of sight for engagement to work and can operate with standalone 
readers, without human intervention, is a major differentiator. RFID systems can read hundreds of tags in 
seconds, and with RFID you can assess the number of tagged items whether they are on the highway, in the 
bag or box, or even on a conveyor belt. What’s more, this can be done from over 100 feet away, regardless of 
the direction of the tag relative to the reader. 
 RFID tags—because they do not need to be oriented toward a reading device and can be read through 
most packaging materials—can be embedded into items at the point of manufacture or enclosed and 
attached to items and labels as they are packaged. RFID tags will continue to work when covered, and 
generally even when their appearance is damaged, or if they get wet or dirty during transit. 
 RFID  Costs 
 Costs of implementing a system varies on volume of tags, equipment choices, and extent of automation. 
Small, passive RFID tags for basic paper and non-metal distribution use can begin around 7 to 15 cents per 
tag, and climb to well over a dollar for larger ones and those used on metal, auto parts, and equipment. This 
cost is a key barrier to RFID mass adoption in retail. For higher-value items (electronics or higher value items 
of apparel), the return on investment (ROI) is there, but for lower-cost retail items, the mostly negligible cost 
of printing barcodes has a significant advantage. 
 Active powered RFID tags, on the other hand, start at around $20. 
 Reader costs are often tied to application and software, with geozone and active assets readers on the 
low end starting in the $100 range and manual handheld readers starting at about $2,000. 
 Both RFID and barcodes are useful auto-ID technologies. Barcodes are more ubiquitous than RFID, but 
as cost barriers are coming down, we see increased RFID penetration and adoption. 

CHAPTER 18 ■ BARCODES, QR CODES, NFC, AND RFID 
328
 NFC 
 Near Field Communication (NFC) is a subcategory of RFID, with the same “out of sight” capability, but 
designed to work within a shorter communication range. 
 NFC operates in the 13.56MHz frequency  range , requiring NFC enabled items and devices to be in close 
proximity of each other, usually 3-4 centimeters, to exchange information. With RFID, we saw how a tag 
could be read from far away. 
 NFC tags, like RFID tags, vary in the amount of data they can hold and where and how they can be used. 
 When choosing a tag, the application, use-case, and environment are key considerations.  Memory 
capacity is just one of several features to understand. Other features to consider are scan distance, type of 
tag, reliability, and format, as different integrators provide different products. 
 NFC operates on a  higher  data transfer rate than RFID, allowing for data transfer of up to 424Kbps. This 
means quicker engagement and allows for larger amounts of data to be read without sacrificing speed. 
 Where RFID was many-to-one, NFC is more secure, providing a  one-to-one data exchange of one-way 
and two-way communication. Additionally, NFC systems boast automatic connection to more advanced 
communication systems, such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. NFC can also be compatible with one-way readable 
RFID tags operating at the same frequency. 
 Using NFC 
 Using NFC is simple. You place an NFC enabled device, usually a smartphone or tablet, close to an NFC tag 
or other NFC enabled device, and they connect. This connection initiates an activity or shares information 
with a device. For example, sending a URL from a poster to a phone, payment credentials to a PoS, or an 
electronic key to open a door. 
 This simple connection is because NFC technology relies on a uniform standard of interoperability 
globally. This means all data exchange, simple transactions, and wireless connections use the same NFC 
specifications around the world. The uniformity is promoted by the NFC Forum, which specifies tag types 
so as to be operable with NFC devices. This is the backbone of interoperability between  different  NFC tag 
providers and NFC device manufacturers that ensures a consistent user experience. This global, uniform 
source of engagement is what energizes the proponents and advocates of NFC. 
 One of the strengths of NFC is that it requires minimal setup to start using its basic functions. Most 
smartphones and many tablets, cameras, and other consumer devices are now NFC enabled off-the-shelf 
and out of the box. As a solutions designer, the big appeal of this is that integrating new and additional 
devices into an already running system is simple. Because most devices come with all of the necessary 
components, there should be no additional costs or complications. 
 Forbidden Fruit 
 Apple’s  introduction   of NFC support with the iPhone 6 was a huge boost in the arm for NFC payments. 
However, it’s important to understand that Apple has yet to open up developer access to NFC, so its only 
use is to enable Apple Wallet. The lack of iOS support for NFC applications is a significant barrier to broader 
adoption, especially in the United States, where iOS has its largest market share.  
 NFC’s  Lower Barrier to Entry 
 A strength of NFC is that there is a low barrier to entry. While QR codes require the correct app and 
conditions, and barcodes and RFID tags need specific, often costly, readers, NFC is readily available to pretty 
much everyone. 

CHAPTER 18 ■ BARCODES, QR CODES, NFC, AND RFID 
329
 This even includes applications for the visually impaired. For instance, there is an installation in 
Bulgaria that uses NFC tags to enable the blind to read travel information at bus stops. The tags help visually 
impaired travelers determine where they are and how to select the proper route to get to their destination. 
 With accessibility and ubiquity comes convenience. Consumers can deliver payment options, coupons, 
loyalty programs, and brand apps, as well as links to join in interactive games, product information, and 
social media connections. They can make a payment, hail a cab, enter a hotel room, or get a seat on a bus. 
They can also use their smartphones to read a smart poster, tag, label, or other tap point to quickly and easily 
get more information on products and services. 
 NFC’s Three Modes: Discovery, Peer-to-Peer, Card Emulation 
 NFC relies on creating tags and labels, both passive and active, which contain chips and antennae just 
like those for RFID. NFC has three modes of operation, or ways in which it interacts with and exchanges 
information. 
 These three basic modes of operation are discovery mode (often referred to as “read-and-write”), 
peer-to-peer mode, and card emulation mode.
• 
 Discovery mode is the basic one-way read/write connection like RFID, where passive 
tags are written, encoded with information, and then read by  a n active NFC enabled 
device. In discovery mode, NFC is used as a “pointer” at tap, which means it uses a 
URL and “points” to, or sends the user to, a specific site. Wristbands, convention, and 
exhibition passes and numerous other forms of printed and distributable marketing 
materials and media assets (like posters, coasters and business cards) are embedded 
with NFC tags that allow consumers to tap on them and engage a URL, which will 
redirect them to branded information. 
• 
 Peer-to-peer mode  enables two-way NFC communication and data exchange 
between the two points, enabling a device to act or be seen as both a reader and a 
tag. This allows two NFC enabled devices to share data, like contact information 
and pictures, or pair with Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. NFC has been incorporated into the 
Bluetooth specification because it offers a fast and simple way to pair Bluetooth 
devices. 
 This bi-directional communication capability allows for another consumer use-case: 
geo-targeted and geofenced message delivery. One of the benefits that NFC offers 
is no more need to “pair” devices. This makes them simpler to use and improves 
security by not maintaining connections. 
• 
 In  card emulation mode, NFC mobile devices act as a smart card, like your credit 
card. Rather than you having to swipe a magnetic strip or insert into a reader, it 
works in a contactless manner with an NFC reader. In this mode, the mobile phone 
acts as the card and the NFC reader creates an active RFID field to read it. This is 
generally used for payment, access, and ticketing systems where consumers use their 
smartphones in place of credit, debit, transit, and access cards. 
 NFC in transportation provides a more efficient mobile or smart card consumer experience with 
cashless ticketing and cashless payments. This streamlining can improve operational costs and enhance the 
customer experience by reducing wait and access times. Potentially, this could even simplify the exchange of 
different currencies and improve international travel. 

CHAPTER 18 ■ BARCODES, QR CODES, NFC, AND RFID 
330
 NFC  Adoption  
 NFC-enabled payment systems and mobile wallets are starting to gain traction across all retail sectors. With 
Clipper in San Francisco Bay, Orca in Seattle, Octopus in Hong Kong, and the FareBot app from Android for 
NFC devices, as well as mobile payment apps with NFC options, including Apple Wallet, Samsung Pay, and 
Android Pay, contactless “smart” cards and NFC technology are changing the way we shop, pay, and travel. 
 Push versus Pull 
 With RFID, NFC, barcodes, and QR codes, users are actively seeking information, choosing to engage the 
technology. This is called  pull communication , when you want to know something and reach out to extract 
that information from the environment and “pull” it to you. 
 iBeacon and Eddystone UID  enable  push communication. In push communication, information 
is broadcast or pushed to a receiver. Like QR codes, the receiver must download an app to receive these 
communications. But once that app is downloaded and enabled, the recipients will passively receive 
information, even if they don’t always actively want to receive or engage with the information being 
dis tributed. 
 When applied to marketing, push and  pull   refer to how consumers are approached and how you 
advertise to them. Both techniques can be effective, and skillful marketing will take advantage of both. 
Successfully doing so creates interactive communication. 
 Interactive communication relies on a back-and-forth exchange, the dynamic, two-way flow of 
information, give and take, where both parties are engaged, albeit in different ways at different times. This 
is how beacons and these “automated identification technologies” work together. Sometimes you call 
someone (pull), sometimes you are called (push) in order to update, alert, share, and so on. You connect, 
share, assess, and reconnect. As connected consumers living “smart” lives; these seamless, multichannel 
“informed” communications are what drive our decisions.  
 How Does This Play Out? 
 Mobile marketing using proximity allows brands to connect consumers through their phones and other 
mobile devices with technology like NFC, Bluetooth beacons, and QR codes. Our smartphones and mobile 
devices, including wearable technology, have become extensions of us, and the central point of connectivity 
between us and our world, communities, and activities. We use our phones for traveling, shopping, ticketing, 
access, payments, and more, and now expect the information and data gathered and stored on them to be 
remembered, analyzed, and utilized to make future engagements easier and faster. 
 Technologies like NFC, paired with beacons, can support this cycle and be deployed for advertising, in-
store marketing, couponing, and loyalty. 
 Consider a scenario where use of NFC and beacons are integrated. Consumers enter a store or restaurant 
where they are able to tap their phone on an NFC-enabled item and get information or a coupon and join a 
loyalty program or download the Bluetooth beacon app. This connects them to the brand or environment for 
future engagement, allowing them to be notified and receive additional offers and promotions when in range 
of the beacons on their next visit. The brand or advertiser can distribute NFC tags in marketing materials to 
new audiences as a cost-effective way to promote and support beacon app adoption and use. 
 Mobile wallets  are prime examples of where these systems unite to bring the most value to the business 
and the consumer. Beacons can be used to ping the consumer’s mobile phone, welcoming loyal customers 
as they enter the store and providing them with a VIP product offering or discount, or updating them on 
their favorite brand. Apple Wallet can use Bluetooth beacons in the store to trigger a Wallet Pass with a 
promotion displayed on the home screen. Finally, the customized, streamlined experience is completed 
when NFC is used to pass the payment credentials to the PoS when an item is purchased. 

CHAPTER 18 ■ BARCODES, QR CODES, NFC, AND RFID 
331
 For marketing, this scenario can be played out in endless variations in stadiums, movie theatres, 
and other venues where you can use technology as a call to action on posters and other media, inspiring 
consumers to download the  beacon app and engage with the environment. From that point on, you can use 
beacons to provide alerts, promotions, offers, check-ins, photo opportunities, and much more.   
 Summary 
 Each of these technologies comes with its own strengths and weaknesses, applications, and limitations. 
 These implementations can have a tremendous impact beyond the customer experience through to 
manufacturing and supply-chain management across industries. Real-time data spanning, purchase, and 
distribution can improve decisions about where products are made and how and when they are delivered. 
Businesses can direct and redirect shipments on demand. They can close the gap between what they 
produce and what they sell. This can impact just-in-time inventory and can help retailers make more sales. 
 The best technology for the job will rely on a variety of factors: specific needs, scale of project, which 
industry you’re in, budget, existing resources, deployment challenges, and integration with smart systems, 
to name just a few. Ultimately, each solution is going to be different, and decisions will need to be made on a 
case-by-case basis. 
 These decisions don’t have to be an either-or discussion. The development and implementation of 
these technologies is an ongoing, ever evolving, “What works best when,” “What is most cost-effective,” 
“What else can we try,” discussion. It is about what actually works and what provides a seamless user 
experience. About what will make the technology disappear behind the activity and what will refine the 
process, enhance engagement, and improve the next experience.

 Some Limitations of Beacons 
 Some of the key attributes that make beacons powerful in identifying that a target user’s device is present at 
a specific location also lead to some limitations. Some of these attributes and  limitations include :
• 
 Short range (a target user must be in close proximity to a beacon to be detected) 
• 
 Deployment is venue-by-venue (proliferation will take time)  
• 
 Disparity of solutions across venues (capabilities of systems deployed in different 
places may vary) 
• 
 Differences in functionality across device types (each manufacturer may standardize 
on different technologies or feature sets, making consistent user experiences more 
difficult) 
• 
 Data management for non-centrally administered deployments (data discrepancies 
and degradation may be introduced over time as beacons are moved, replaced, or 
fail, or due to variations in individual venue administrative practices) 
• 
 Cost to deploy and upgrade (labor-intensive to proliferate quickly and/or vastly)  
• 
 A significant proportion of phone users turn off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, while keeping 
their cellular connection on, in order to save power 
 Beacons enable precise detection of presence and positioning because of their relatively short 
communication range. As a result, to effectively locate users, their devices must be in very close proximity 
to a beacon (typically within 50 meters). To detect a user’s presence anytime, anywhere would require an 
impractically large number of beacons. Even detecting presence anytime or anywhere that is important 
or desirable using only beacons is likely an unachievable challenge as well. Achieving a broader degree 
of ubiquitous presence detection beyond the communication range of even a vast number of deployed 
beacons requires use of other means of detection or location  determination . 
 While GPS is great at locating a device outdoors or in relatively open environments, even GPS has 
limitations in many indoor or other situations obstructed from satellite visibility. Something more is needed 
for greater indoor presence detection that relies less heavily on venue-specific implementations. 
 According to a 2012 survey conducted by  TIME magazine, 84% of people worldwide said they couldn’t 
go a single day without their cell phone.  Deseret News reported in 2014 that a Mobile Mindset Study by 
Lookout found that 58% of smartphone users don’t go more than one hour without checking their device. 
With this proliferation of cell phone use bordering on addiction finding its way into nearly every aspect of 
people’s lives, cellular networks offer one of the broadest and most accessible means of device location 1 . 
 An example of cellular network location is visible to most smartphone users when they first open their 
mapping or navigation applications and see the large blue circle around their location that progressively 
becomes smaller. These applications often use information from the cellular network to quickly present the 
initial location estimate represented by the large circle. That initial location estimate is then used to help 
initialize and validate the more accurate location derived from other technology available on the device, such 
as Wi-Fi or GPS. This same capability can provide benefits when used in conjunction with beacons as well.

CHAPTER 19 ■ AUGMENTING BEACONS WITH CELLULAR NETWORK TECHNOLOGIES
335
 How Cellular Network Location Works 
 First, what is it about a cellular network that enables cellular devices to be located? 
 Cellular networks consist of an array of strategically located wireless base  stations (commonly referred 
to as  cell sites ) that are interconnected via a backhaul network to the Internet and public telephone networks 
through mobile switching centers. Each mobile switching center may interconnect hundreds or thousands 
of cell sites. A simplistic analogy is to envision the area surrounding each cell site as an individual cell of a 
honeycomb and the cellular network as an entire beehive comprised of one or more honeycombs. 
 The coverage area of a single cell site ranges from very small, such as one floor or suite of rooms in a 
building, to very large, such as a few miles along an interstate highway, and any place in between. In addition 
to coverage limitations, each cell site has a limit to the number of users (i.e., simultaneous calls, text messages, 
or data traffic) it can adequately support. Cell site deployments are engineered to provide the coverage and 
capacity necessary to serve their subscriber base. Areas with greater population densities therefore tend to 
have more cell sites than those areas with less population density. A typical metropolitan area might have a 
vast array of several thousand cell sites to serve its dense population of users. An interstate highway between 
population centers might only be served by a handful of cell sites strung miles apart along the highway.  
 The term “cellular” stems from the arrangement of cell sites and the patchwork of communication 
coverage that their carefully planned deployment provides. Cellular network engineers strive to install 
cell site equipment and their antennae in an optimized fashion so that the coverage areas of adjacent 
sites overlap just enough to allow a device to move from one cell to another without ever losing contact 
completely. Yet, engineers also strive to ensure that the coverage is not overlapping so much that the cell 
sites interfere with each other or provide wasted coverage and capacity in one place. 
 To add capacity at a single cell site while avoiding too much overlapping coverage, engineers typically 
segment the coverage of most larger cell  sites (known as  macrocells ) into segments called sectors. A typical 
macrocell might have three sectors (envision a pie cut into three slices, each representing a sector of the cell). 
In some cases, engineers intentionally deploy cell site equipment to have overlapping coverage in order to serve 
greater network capacity in a particular area with large numbers of users or heavy network usage. Thereby 
network usage in that area can be distributed across all the sites covering it. 
 Engineers may also deploy cell sites with small coverage areas in the midst of larger cells and 
sectors to improve both coverage and capacity. These smaller cells—known as microcells, picocells,  and 
 femtocells—may be deployed to fill small holes in coverage or increase capacity in areas of concentrated 
usage (e.g., a microcell at an airport terminal, mall, or conference center; a picocell in an elevator shaft, 
one floor of a large building, or a tunnel; or a femtocell in a home or small office). 
 As the proliferation of smartphones and other connected devices has skyrocketed,  the  tools used by cellular 
network engineers have come to include other even more sophisticated and creative means of delivering 
surgically precise and economical coverage and capacity. These include so-called leaky coax, fiber-fed antenna 
systems, distributed antenna systems, and on and on. However, that’s a topic for yet another book. 
 With this broader deployment of microcells, picocells, femtocells, and more creative solutions to 
beef up indoor coverage, increase capacity, or fill in coverage gaps, cellular networks have become an 
ideal means of determining a device’s location as well as serving its communication needs. The ability to 
locate devices present in these more concentrated cells can approach the proximity detection and location 
determination accuracy of Wi-Fi networks and beacons themselves (such areas of high population density—
and cell site density—will tend to be areas where beacons are likely to be deployed as well). 
 At its most basic,  cellular  location determination or proximity detection is based on the knowledge 
within the cellular network of the identity of the cell site that is providing service to a mobile device and the 
known location of that particular cell site. By inference, if a device is connected to a particular cell site, and 
that cell site’s location is known, then the approximate location of the user may also be known. As the area 
covered by a cell site becomes smaller, the uncertainty in where the user is located also becomes smaller, 
and thus a more accurate user location can be inferred. In this sense, cellular location determination is very 
similar to identifying the proximity of a device to a beacon where the cell site is essentially the “beacon”. 
Two means of location determination using cellular network capabilities are commonly referred to as 
network-based location and cell ID look-up. 

CHAPTER 19 ■ AUGMENTING BEACONS WITH CELLULAR NETWORK TECHNOLOGIES
336
 Cell ID Look-Up versus Network-Based Location 
 There are two broad means of location determination possible via cellular networks depending on the 
device and network capabilities. (Note this excludes use of GPS, Wi-Fi, and other means of location that 
might use the cellular network to communicate or augment the resulting location capability. These are 
covered in Chapter   17 .) 
 Cell ID Look-Up 
 The protocols used to communicate between cellular base stations (at cell sites) and mobile  devices 
 include data fields containing the identity of the base station (the “cell ID”). This method of location uses 
the cell ID that a mobile device detects in its regular communication with the cellular base stations. Large 
databases of cell IDs and their corresponding latitude and longitude coordinates are aggregated either by 
crowdsourcing or obtained directly from network operators. Some providers of cell ID location services 
include LocationSmart, Google, and RX Networks. Such services make use of databases containing cell ID 
coordinates of more than forty million cell sites deployed around the world. 
 These cell ID coordinate databases must be continually refreshed to stay up to date as cell sites are 
moved, added, or modified by network operators as they maintain, expand, and optimize their networks. In 
addition to obtaining periodic database updates directly from network operators, cell ID service providers 
 also  use crowdsourced data from providers of smartphone applications, embedded vehicle-tracking devices 
and wireless modules embedded in a host of other equipment. To enable this crowdsourcing, cooperative 
application publishers and mobile service providers that locate devices using GPS or other means program 
those devices to also report observed cell site IDs when communicating with application servers. In this way, 
millions of devices serve as database contributors through their normal day-to-day use. 
 Cell ID location service providers enable application providers to locate cellular devices by querying 
their databases for the location of cell IDs reported by their device software or mobile applications. Devices 
that are not locatable using GPS or other means are thereby made locatable. Any device on the cellular 
network is capable of observing the cell ID through normal cellular network communications. However, a 
device must have some special programming or application installed that can report the information to an 
application server for it to be looked up in a cell ID database. Figure  19-1  illustrates the data flow for this cell 
ID look-up method of cellular network location. 

CHAPTER 19 ■ AUGMENTING BEACONS WITH CELLULAR NETWORK TECHNOLOGIES
337
 The cell ID look-up method is  an  active process from the standpoint of the device to be located. That 
is to say, the device must actively execute specific processing so that the look-up can be conducted by 
the application or service provider interested in its location. The device must have specialized software 
running on it (an application, embedded program or built in operating system functionality) to perform the 
collection and reporting of its cell ID observations to the operator of the intended service or application. 
If the software is in an application, the user must download the application if it is not already pre-installed 
on the device. For certain devices, such as those used for commercial vehicle tracking, remote equipment 
monitoring, or automotive telematics services, the cell ID reporting capability may be built into their core 
functionality. The cell ID parameters used by such software are typically part of the information output from 
the wireless communications chipsets within cellular devices to facilitate communication management and 
diagnostic functions. 
 The cell ID look-up method is typically used by embedded communications modules or devices that are 
not equipped with GPS or other location capabilities or that require a backup to such capabilities. These are 
generally very low power and small devices that might be installed for remote monitoring, environmental 
sensing, motion detection, etc. In many cases, they have a need for low power consumption, very low cost, 
or use in areas that lack visibility to GPS satellites. Devices with GPS and other location capabilities may also 
use cell ID look-up as a backup when the device is in an area or environment that prevents GPS operation 
(e.g., underground, indoors, inside an enclosure, electromagnetic interference, low battery, etc.).

CHAPTER 19 ■ AUGMENTING BEACONS WITH CELLULAR NETWORK TECHNOLOGIES
338
 Network-Based Location 
 Some wireless network operators allow application providers or trusted parties to query their network for 
the location of a device  via  network API gateways or service delivery platforms. These services are available 
from most operators in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom as well as the larger operators in 
India, Spain, and Brazil such as Vodafone, Airtel, and Telefonica. Some of the companies authorized to offer 
services using cellular network location include LocationSmart and Location Labs in the United States and 
OpenMarket in the United Kingdom. 
 This method uses the near real-time knowledge within the network about which cell site(s) are 
communicating, or have recently communicated, with the device to be located. This is typically a  passive 
process from the standpoint of the device in that it does not require any application-specific action or 
processing to be performed by the device itself. The device simply needs to be turned on and connected to 
the network with normal network communications enabling the device’s location to be determined. Since 
this is an inherent capability that networks use to manage communications with all devices on the network, 
the location of any device can be determined as long as it is connected to the network at the time. 
 This is frequently dramatized in television and cinema when the good guys urgently map the location 
of a bad guy or missing good guy by “pinging” or “tracing” their device on the spur of the moment. In these 
circumstances, the users and device are clearly passive participants in the location process. In real-world 
applications, the user’s consent is generally required in advance of such “pinging” for any commercial use. 
These user privacy considerations will be covered a bit later in this chapter. 
 In addition to the consent of the user, the network-based location method also requires authorization 
from the network operator to gain access to their networks for location purposes. To make this method 
accessible for application developers and enterprises, location aggregators such as LocationSmart 
implement the necessary privacy controls and trusted connections with the various cellular network 
operators. They are then able to offer access across all the available networks to application providers 
and enterprises via a single relationship, contract, and interface (e.g., secure RESTful web services APIs). 
Figure  19-2 illustrates the data flow for this network-based location method of cellular network location.

 Network-based location varies in sophistication and capability depending on the technology 
implemented by each cellular network operator. This can range from  a   database look-up of the coordinates for 
the cell site to which a device is currently connected to more sophisticated location determination processes 
using information about all cell sites a device’s signal may be able to reach, as well as the respective signal 
strengths, timing measurements, angles of arrival, and other information available within the network. These 
more sophisticated methods may utilize technology built into the cellular infrastructure equipment itself or 
specialized equipment installed in the network specifically for location determination purposes. 
 Network-based location offers a more secure location source than location derived from GPS and 
other sensors resident on the mobile device itself which can be spoofed or manipulated with downloadable 
applications for this purpose or by other means implemented on the device. Since network-based location comes 
from data and equipment within the network operator’s infrastructure, it is not susceptible to such manipulation.  
 Network-based location determination can be as ubiquitous as the network’s coverage footprint, but 
generally provides a less accurate location than other forms of location determination, including beacon 
detection. On the other hand, no special software, downloaded application, or user action is required to take 
advantage of this method of location. This method of location often takes advantage of location technology 
similar to that deployed for cellular emergency call routing and caller location (e.g., wireless Phase I E911 
location in the United States and Canada).

CHAPTER 19 ■ AUGMENTING BEACONS WITH CELLULAR NETWORK TECHNOLOGIES

 Accuracy 
 The accuracy of cellular network location methods is generally proportional to the spacing of the cell 
sites in the vicinity of the device being located or the coverage area of the specific cell site(s) to which it is 
connected. Given typical network deployments, location determination in urban and heavy traffic areas is 
more accurate than the accuracy in rural and sparsely populated areas. For instance, for cell sites deployed 
to deliver indoor coverage (e.g., microcells, picocells, or femtocells), their coverage range is frequently 
limited to the building itself or even only specific rooms or sections of a building. 
 Therefore, a device connected to or in range of such a cell site can be located almost as accurately 
as a beacon or Wi-Fi detection method. This location accuracy may range from tens of meters to a few 
hundred meters. Typical accuracy for cell sites covering outdoor urban areas might be in the range of several 
hundred to a thousand meters (i.e., on the order of a block, ZIP+4 area, or neighborhood). Cell sites covering 
suburban areas provide progressively less accurate location generally in the range of one to three kilometers 
or on the order of a neighborhood or ZIP code area. Cell sites covering less populated or rural areas provide 
location accuracies ranging from a few to tens of kilometers. 
 Privacy Considerations  
 Since obtaining a mobile device’s location using network-based location capabilities does not rely on an 
application downloaded onto the device by the user, there are some specific privacy implications that must 
be addressed before access to a device’s location may be granted to an application or service provider. For a 
service or application to take advantage of network-based location, the user must first be given notice that 
location from their network operator is going to be used for the service/application and the user must give 
their consent to do so. 
 The user may be notified about the use of network location when signing up for the service, 
downloading an application, or upon first use of the service. Consent is obtained from the user by requesting 
a reply to a text message, soliciting an affirmative reply during a call to or from the device, or completing 
an online sign up process that authenticates that the cellular device is in the possession of the user (e.g., by 
sending a PIN or activation code to the device and asking for it to be entered online). Access to the device’s 
location is then enabled for the service or application once the user has granted consent. 
 If the user denies or later revokes that consent, location is no longer made available to that service or 
application. Like the on-screen icons showing applications with location access on smartphones, periodic 
reminders are sent to the device via text messaging, in-app messages, or automated phone calls indicating 
that the service they’ve chosen may be accessing the location of their device. The user may be given an 
opportunity to reply to these notices to update or revoke their consent or given instructions on how to do so 
online or by calling their service provider. A set of industry-developed best practices and uniform guidelines 
for the privacy considerations associated with network-based location are documented in the “CTIA Best 
Practices and Guidelines for Location Based Services,” available on the CTIA web site. 
 Cost Considerations  
 Network-based location and cell ID look-up are both transactional in nature, whereby a service or 
application provider makes a request to the provider of the location services when a location update is 
desired. This query for location typically has a cost associated with it that varies based on the volume of 
location activity used by the application or service offered. In general, the higher the volume of location 
activity, the lower the incremental transaction cost for the location updates. Figure  19-3  illustrates an 
approximate relationship between location update cost and location transaction volume for both methods 
of location. While not exact, the graph is intended to portray the general economies of scale that accrue as 
usage volumes for an application or service increase. 

CHAPTER 19 ■ AUGMENTING BEACONS WITH CELLULAR NETWORK TECHNOLOGIES
341
 A cost advantage of cellular network-based location comes from the user not being required to 
download and use an application resident on the mobile device. Network-based location is certainly used 
quite regularly in conjunction with a downloaded mobile application, but use of a mobile application is 
optional. Users may access services or applications that use network-based location simply by subscribing 
to them on a web site, by signing up with a provider in person, or responding to an online or offline offer via 
almost any communication means. Once the user signs up for a service or application and provides consent 
to be located by responding to a text, in-app message, or call, the service may then be used without having to 
download anything onto the device. This provides lifecycle cost savings to the application or service provider 
by not having to design, develop, test, and maintain a downloadable mobile application across various 
device platforms and operating system versions. 
 Any development can be exclusively focused on server-side functionality which reduces development, 
deployment, and operational complexities and cost. Any service upgrades may be deployed through purely 
server-side upgrades. Avoiding a downloadable application also helps streamline the user adoption process 
by eliminating the hurdles of user application discovery, download, retention, and competition for device 
home screen real estate. These can sometimes be restricting issues to user adoption and continued use for 
many mobile application providers. 
 Representative Use-Cases 
 Cell ID look-up and network-based location are used across a variety of industry verticals and use-cases. 
The range of applications is as diverse as the range of uses for mobile devices. Some specific examples are 
described in the following sections.

CHAPTER 19 ■ AUGMENTING BEACONS WITH CELLULAR NETWORK TECHNOLOGIES
342
 Contact Center Automation 
 Contact centers use network-based location to provide streamlined services to callers whose location is relevant 
at the time of their call. The location may be used to route the call to the appropriate contact center to receive 
the call, to prioritize the caller’s standing in a queue, or to present a contact center application or agent with the 
location information to aid in selecting content for a response to the user’s inquiry. Some specific examples:
• 
 Roadside assistance. The caller’s location is used to route the call to the appropriate 
answering center that serves the area the caller is calling from and then the location 
is presented to a live agent assigned to help the caller once the call is connected. 
This information is also used to confirm verbally provided caller location details and 
avoid potentially large errors due to misinterpretation or confusion on the part of a 
caller, who may be in a stressful situation. 
• 
 National retailer call routing. The caller’s location is used to route calls to a national 
toll-free number to an agent or brick and mortar location in the service area in which 
the caller is located. This allows the call to be routed most quickly and efficiently to 
an agent who is authorized to work with the caller. This eliminates the need for the 
caller to enter the ZIP code or annunciate the city and state, both of which can be 
prone to high error rates. 
• 
 Travel assistance services. Callers located in areas where travel is adversely affected 
by severe weather conditions or flight cancellations are routed to dedicated agents or 
prioritized in call queues to address the urgency of their requests . 
 Proximity  Marketing 
 Here are some specific examples:
• 
 Loyalty program offers. Members of resort and membership club loyalty programs 
who are enrolled to receive promotional offers and special event notifications are 
located via network-based location so that events and notifications most relevant 
to their location are selected for them and sent via text messages or e-mails without 
them having to download an application. 
• 
 Nearby deals. Some radio stations announce advertiser offers accessible through 
text messaging short codes whereby a user may text a specific keyword to the radio 
station’s or advertiser’s short code and receive a coupon or promotional offer for the 
related product or services. For programs using network-based location, the user’s 
phone is located when they text their response to the call to action and more relevant 
offer near them is sent compared to users whose phones are not located. 
 Workforce Management/Transportation and Logistics 
 Here are some specific examples:
• 
 Contract worker monitoring. Businesses that rely on workers who bring their 
own devices and vehicles use work force management applications that use 
network-based location to monitor the location of the worker’s devices during job 
assignments. The business integrates this insight along with information from full-
time employee data obtained through a downloadable application. This saves the 
complexity and difficulty of enforcing specific device types or providing application 
training to contract workers only assigned on a temporary basis. 

CHAPTER 19 ■ AUGMENTING BEACONS WITH CELLULAR NETWORK TECHNOLOGIES
343
• 
 Third-party logistics brokerage. Millions of shipments per year are put out for bid and 
assigned through a network of third-party logistics brokers and services to facilitate 
the match-making activity between shippers and transporters. These shipments 
are frequently arranged through third-party logistics brokers that use online load-
matching services. Many of these assignments are between parties that do not have a 
longstanding or on-going business relationship and therefore it is impractical to have 
a pre-arranged set of tools and technology to help manage and gain insight into the 
status of shipments once assigned and in transit. Network-based location allows the 
brokers and shippers to gain this important insight by simply having the truck drivers 
carrying the shipments opt their phone into a tracking application. The application 
begins monitoring the location of the phone upon job assignment and periodically 
thereafter until the shipment has been delivered. The driver’s phone is then opted 
out and no further location monitoring takes place. This simplicity has allowed 
independent owner operators and individual truck drivers to win new business and 
brokers to deliver a higher level of service when assigning shipments to them. Shippers 
and recipients of goods are also able to gain greater insight into the status of their 
goods in transit and to plan operations at source and destination more effectively.  
 Mobile Gaming/Lottery/Daily Fantasy  Sports 
 A number of states allow online and mobile wagering, sport book, and lottery ticket purchases as long as 
a user’s location can be verified to be within state boundaries or on the premises of authorized wagering 
venues. Network-based location is utilized to securely verify the location of participants’ devices without 
reliance only on device-based location capabilities that may be manipulated without detection. The 
network-based location is correlated with other location and device attributes to achieve the most reliable 
location verification possible. 
 While daily fantasy sports are not deemed to be gambling, certain jurisdictions may impose rules on 
their activity to administer local regulations more effectively. Being able to ascertain the location of a daily 
fantasy sports participant allows providers of such services to comply with these local regulatory differences. 
 Fraud Prevention/Transaction Verification 
 Network-based location is used to verify travel activity of cardholders when debit or credit card transactions 
are detected outside of their usual home areas. Cellular network-based location is being used for travel 
within the cardholder’s home country as well as internationally to help improve customer service by 
reducing the number of inadvertent declined transactions as well as to identify potentially fraudulent ones 
more effectively.  
 Asset Tracking 
 Devices installed in packaging of sensitive materials and cargo containers are located using cell ID look-up 
when devices are inside containers or buildings that prevent location via GPS. They are also periodically 
located using cell ID look-up to minimize battery drain from frequent or unnecessary GPS location updates. 
 Systems monitoring aircraft engines equipped with embedded cellular telemetry modules use cell ID 
look-up to tag engine diagnostic updates with location information to ascertain travel patterns and confirm 
the location of engines requiring maintenance actions. 
 Oil field operations management systems monitoring fluid levels use cell ID look-up to confirm the 
location of movable tanks requiring service as they approach high or low capacity limits.   

CHAPTER 19 ■ AUGMENTING BEACONS WITH CELLULAR NETWORK TECHNOLOGIES
344
 Future Developments 
 More accurate location determination by cellular network operators is being driven by United States Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC) rulemaking to address needs expressed by the public safety community 
for more useful location information during emergency calls originating from indoors. The rulemaking is 
driving industry efforts to meet implementation milestones beginning in 2020 and beyond. The technical 
standards and operational  considerations  are being formulated through industry organizations such as the 
Emergency Services Interconnection Forum (ESIF) within the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry 
Solutions (ATIS) and the Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council (CSRIC), an 
FCC advisory committee. These organizations are undertaking collaborative initiatives among carriers, 
Internet and broadband service providers, public safety community stakeholders, technology supplies, and 
emergency service providers. The objective of the enhancements being pursued is to allow first responders 
to achieve indoor location knowledge accurately enough to get to a person in need of assistance with as little 
ambiguity as possible—to the exact floor, room, and corner of a building. 
 New technologies to meeting this objective are in developmental and testing stages to meet the 
timeline for implementation under consideration over the next five years. Some of the technologies 
under consideration include coordinated Wi-Fi access point and beacon database management, 
enhanced Wi-Fi positioning techniques, enhanced beacon detection and positioning, overlay terrestrial 
trilateration positioning systems, and LTE trilateration systems.  
 Summary 
 Beacons can provide targeted information about where people are with their devices or inform them about 
what’s nearby. Being able to provide similar insights to and about people when they are not close to beacons 
depends on leveraging alternative technologies. With the vast proliferation of cellular networks and people’s 
dependence on their cellular devices, cellular network location capabilities provide a broad and accessible 
solution. Two methods of cellular network location available to developers include cell ID look-up and 
network-based location. 
 Cell ID look-up allows an application server to query a database of cell site locations for any mobile 
device capable of reporting the identity of the cell site providing cellular service to it. To accomplish this, the 
device requires software to report the cell site identities it observes on the air embedded in normal cellular 
network communications. This allows devices that are not equipped with GPS or other location capabilities 
or that are in situations where those solutions can’t operate (e.g., indoors) to be located anywhere there is 
cellular service available. 
 Network-based location allows application servers to obtain the location of a device by querying the 
cellular network in real-time for the location of the cell site serving the device. This method does not require 
any specialized software on the device. It simply requires the user to opt-in to a service and for the device 
to be connected to the cellular network. Thereby an application server may obtain location information 
without installation of a mobile application on the device. 
 Both methods enable location determination useful in a variety of applications ranging from contact 
center automation, field services, mobile workforce management, proximity marketing, asset tracking, 
mobile gaming and lottery regulatory compliance, financial transaction verification, and transportation 
and logistics. As cellular network operators continue to enhance their networks to meet the needs of first 
responders for better indoor location, those and other technologies will provide new solutions applicable to 
these and other commercial services as well.

 CHAPTER 20  
 Where Beacons Are Making a 
Difference 
 Dr. Phil Hendrix, Managing Director, immr 
 As with any new technology, beacons are the subject of considerable speculation and even hype. Still in 
the early stages, beacon deployments have met with success as well as disappointment, 1  prompting some 
to question whether beacons will ever fulfill their promise. This chapter shows how beacons, properly 
integrated with mobile solutions, are transforming customer experience, improving operations, and 
boosting the bottom line for brand, retailers, and other businesses. 
 The discussion highlights applications across five key verticals where beacons are making a difference, 
proving valuable and even indispensable to end users as well as the organizations deploying them. The 
verticals include airports, attractions, restaurants, retail, and enterprises, while the applications include 
location-specific alerts and notification, indoor navigation with “points of interest,” timely and relevant 
content and offers that consumers value and respond to, and more. Each section identifies customer needs 
and problems that beacons are solving. In our experience, this step is critical and often distinguishes 
between deployments that succeed and those that fall short or fail altogether.

 In addition to the verticals and applications presented here, beacons are making a difference in many 
other instances. The summary includes a list of 30 use-cases and a matrix highlighting the most compelling 
applications across the five key verticals. A full list highlighting the most significant applications across more 
than 20 verticals, including events, healthcare, movie theatres, transit, and others, is available from the author. 
 The use-cases presented in the following sections are a snapshot of current efforts— innovative 
businesses and imaginative developers are finding new ways to integrate beacons into mobile solutions. 
Given the benefits and growing momentum, companies in many verticals will soon be asked and forced to 
answer, “why aren’t our apps beacon-enabled?” 
 Airports Are Taking Some of the Stress Out of Travel 
 From Miami 2 to Hong Kong 3 , the millions who travel each day through the world’s airports can look forward 
to easier and more enjoyable experiences thanks to beacons. For even the most seasoned frequent flyers, 
circumnavigating through airports can be a hectic, nerve-wracking, and even costly experience.  Travelers   
must contend with a number of challenges, including:
• 
  Last-minute gate changes and flight delays 
• 
  Connecting flights in distant concourses and terminals 
• 
  Choosing where to eat given schedule, budget, and lines 
• 
  Finding baggage claim and luggage 
• 
  Locating and choosing transportation from the airport to a hotel or venue  
• 
  Finding the car, especially after a lengthy trip 
• 
  Locating family members who have gotten lost or separated from the group 
• 
  Retrieving commonly lost items, such as luggage, electronics, passports, and wallets  
• 
  Flight delays and cancellations due to weather or mechanical problems, especially 
when rebooking or overnight accommodations are required 
• 
  On international trips, passport, visa, customs, and related issues    
 While booking and in-flight experience have received considerable attention, airports and airlines have 
begun to focus more attention on travelers’ needs in the airport, from arrival to departure and all points 
in between. To assist travelers, airports and airline partners have historically relied on signage, printed 
materials, and personnel. Going beyond these traditional solutions, airports like Miami International 4 and 
Schiphol in Amsterdam 5 are developing and deploying innovative, beacon-powered mobile apps that enable 
travelers and enhance their experience.

 Airports  in countries around the world are turning mobile devices into digital concierge, guiding and 
assisting travelers with timely, personalized directions, information, alerts, and notifications.
• 
 Beacons allow airports’ and partners’ mobile apps to recognize travelers who have 
opted-in as they approach, enter, and move within the airport as well as in adjacent 
areas such as ground transportation and parking. 
• 
 Much like a personal navigation device (PND), beacon-powered apps provide 
“blue dot” navigation and step-by-step directions indoors, where GPS doesn’t work, 
guiding travelers from parking and check-in to gates, concessions, baggage claim, 
and customs. 
• 
 With access to airport operations data, mobile apps notify travelers of gate changes, 
flight delays and other disruptions and, with beacons pinpointing their location, 
redirect them in real-time to the proper gate or nearest support center. 
• 
 Useful for travelers as well as airport concessions, apps display on a map nearby 
stores, restaurants and other points-of-interest as well as information and access to 
ground transportation, parking, and other amenities.  
• 
 With proximity revealed by beacons and (potentially) audience characteristics such 
as destination, time available, and others, brands and airport businesses can present 
timely, relevant mobile ads and offers that travelers value and respond to. 
 Beacon-powered apps can also ease the burden on airport  personnel , offloading many of the questions 
they must currently answer. JFK and other airports are also using beacons to identify lines that are getting 
too long and creating choke points, 6 thereby reducing wait times, one of the most frustrating parts of 
air travel. By streamlining customer experience and connecting consumers to shopping, restaurants, 
entertainment, and other products and services, beacon-powered apps also boost on- and off-airport 
businesses, providing additional revenue for airports and their partners. 
 With the number growing by the day, the list of beacon deployments includes airports in every part of the 
world, including N. America (Austin, Burbank, 7 Dallas – Ft. Worth, 8  Miami International, Orlando 9  and others); 
Europe (Bologna 10 , Nice, 11  eight UK airports, 12 and others); and Asia (Hong Kong, 13 Tokyo, 14  and others).

Much like digital signage, mobile apps powered by beacons will soon be a fixture in airports. SITA, 15 the 
airport industry’s largest provider of technology services, expects most major airports will have beacons fully 
deployed by 2020. Integrating beacons with partners’ systems and apps (airlines, car rental, concessions and 
other companies) adds to the complexity and requires more time. However, integrated solutions reach many 
more travelers and offer deeper functionality. 
 As these examples show, by deploying and integrating beacons, airports and their partners are 
transforming travelers’ pre- and post-flight experiences and reducing stress for travelers and personnel. 
Beacon-powered solutions are also lowering the cost of delivering services and support and providing a 
powerful new channel for brands and airport businesses to engage receptive customers.  
 Attractions Are Engaging Guests with Content 
 Every major  city in the world has a variety of attractions, including museums, zoos, aquariums, gardens, 
theme parks, and many others. Attractions differ in a number of ways, including their focus, size, and 
audiences. Smaller attractions, such as the Petersen Automotive Museum 16 in L.A., may attract fewer visitors 
but they are no less fervent than guests who visit larger attractions such as the Metropolitan Museum of 
Art 17 . While visitors may spend a couple of hours at the World of Coca-Cola 18  in Atlanta, they can spend 
days taking in and absorbing the 19 museums that make up the Smithsonian 19 . While attractions such as 
the National Wrestling Hall of Fame 20 tend to attract predominantly adult audiences, zoos and theme parks 
appeal to families with kids of all ages. Finally, guests may include occasional and even first-time visitors as 
well as “regulars,” some of whom have joined as members. 
 Despite their variety, attractions and their guests share a number of common characteristics:
• 
 Attractions offer immersive experiences where guests can learn, appreciate, reflect 
upon, be entertained, and possibly even inspired. 
• 
 While attractions offer lectures, demonstrations, and interactive experiences, most 
curate and display artifacts and exhibits of every imaginable sort, from art to animals, 
automobiles, airplanes, and even space ships. The items displayed are often rare, 
even one-of-a-kind, exposing guests to experiences that are not available elsewhere. 
• 
 Most attractions consist of a combination of permanent and temporary exhibits, with 
the latter changing periodically over the course of the year. 
• 
 The majority of attractions appeal to families, exposing adults and kids to new 
experiences, stimulating their creativity and expanding their appreciation for the 
world around them. 
• 
 Quite often selected exhibits within an attraction are much more popular than 
others, resulting in queues and crowds in some areas and light traffic in other areas.

 Regardless of size or  audience , attractions face a number of challenges:
• 
 Satisfying guests’ curiosity—Guests are curious and often want to know more about 
exhibits. While signage and staff can answer some questions, providing additional 
content that satisfies guests’ curiosity is a never-ending challenge.  
• 
 Promoting exhibits—Making guests aware of and encouraging them to visit less 
familiar and possibly less popular exhibits.  
• 
 Engaging guests—Providing experiences that engage guests, regardless of their age 
or familiarity with the exhibits. 
• 
 Stimulating patronage—Enticing guests to visit more often and support the 
attraction by patronizing the gift shop, making a donation, or even becoming a 
member. 
 To achieve these objectives attractions historically relies on a mix of maps, guidebooks, and other 
printed materials, as well as audio guides, tours, and interactive sessions led by paid and volunteer staff. 
Staff members are trained to answer a myriad of questions, from hours and amenities to “why are giraffes’ 
tongues so long?” 
 From museums to wineries and  zoos , attractions are rapidly integrating beacons with mobile apps to 
enhance guest experiences using some variation of the approach outlined here:
• 
 For each exhibit, content is produced that explains in more detail what the exhibit is 
all about. The content is accessible via the web or within the app. 
• 
 As a guest approaches an exhibit, the beacon-powered app recognizes the guest’s 
location and the app (or web site) displays the content for that exhibit. 
• 
 As with social media, visitors can “like” attractions and post comments. User-
generated comments, photos, and ratings can be displayed as part of the exhibit’s 
content. 
• 
 The app can also recommend and provide directions to other exhibits that are likely 
to be of interest. 
• 
 Trivia, passbooks, and other elements of gamification can be incorporated, 
challenging kids and adults alike. 
 In the hands of imaginative designers, beacons transform mobile apps and devices into  docent, 
concierge, and tour guide , all in one. For example:
• 
 In Istanbul 21 and other countries, museums are providing self-guided tours, triggered 
by beacons. More sophisticated solutions can tailor tours to a visitor’s schedule 
(e.g., one to four hours), interests (modern versus 19th century artists), and more. 
• 
 Zoos in Italy 22 and elsewhere are providing additional information on animals, 
including origin, habitats, risk of extinction, eating habits, offspring, and much, 
much more.

• 
 The Kew Royal Botanic Gardens 23 in London and others are providing information 
on exotic species. Some gardens even offer tips for related plants suitable in guests’ 
own gardens. 
• 
  Many attractions, including The World of Coca-Cola 24 , provide links that make it easy 
to shop for and purchase prints, stuffed animals, apparel, and other memorabilia 
that extend the guest experience and support the attraction. 
 By  making engaging content for each exhibit automatically accessible, beacon-powered apps are 
providing highly personalized, immersive experiences. The content and forms of engagement are limited 
only by the imagination of designers and budget. While museums are leading the way, attractions of all sorts 
are rapidly integrating beacons and mobile solutions to transform 25  the guest experience.  
 Restaurants Are Making Diners Happy 
 There is a good chance that diners will be seeing more beacons with their meals—that is, in the  restaurants 
that serve their meals. Actually, they won’t be seeing them because beacons work in the background. 
 At breakfast, lunch, and dinner, a majority of the meals consumed by Americans are prepared by 
restaurants. Long dominated by McDonald’s, Taco Bell, and other QSRs (quick-serve restaurants), the 
restaurant industry’s growth has been propelled by Chipotle, Panera, and other so-called fast casual 
restaurants. In addition to national and regional chains, the industry includes a large number of 
independent restaurants. 
 At QSR and fast casual restaurants, millions of consumers daily take part in a now familiar drill. They 
drive up or walk in, wait in line, look at the menu behind the register, place an order, pay, step aside, wait 
for the order, request or pick up condiments, and, if dining in, find a  table   and enjoy their meal. While the 
ritual is familiar, several aspects detract from the customer’s experience and interfere with the restaurant’s 
objectives:
• 
 Consumers don’t like to wait in line. 
• 
 Despite new and improved digital signage, consumers have a limited opportunity to 
view the menu, much less learn of and consider new items.  
• 
 Requesting a variation (for example, “hold the pickles”) can complicate and delay 
the process. 
• 
 Whether an order is placed at the counter or drive-thru, as many as 2-3% of 
customers’ orders have errors, with the number higher during busy times. 
• 
 While enjoying or completing their meal, if diners want to order dessert or additional 
items they must repeat the drill. 
• 
 When a dining experience is exceptionally good or bad, short of asking to speak with 
the manager (which few do), customers cannot easily provide feedback or resolve 
the issue.

 Recognizing these and  other challenges, QSRs and fast casual restaurants are racing to incorporate 
digital and mobile solutions into the dining experience. Taco Bell’s CEO heralded their new mobile app, 
which enables ordering and customization as, “the biggest breakthrough since the drive-thru.” Along with 
mobile apps, beacons are helping to streamline and enhance the entire guest experience, especially ordering 
and payment. For example:
• 
 Using Taco Bell’s mobile app, customers can order ahead and, as they approach and 
come within range of the restaurant’s beacons, a team member can deliver the food 
at curbside, eliminating the need to wait in the drive-thru line.  
• 
 Using a mobile app like Downtown 26 , restaurant customers can view the menu 
on their device, place their orders, and have their food delivered to their table, 
bypassing the usual lines. During the meal, customers can order additional items 
and have them delivered to their table. Finally, without ever leaving the table, 
customers can pay their tab, eliminating the need to wait, all enabled by beacons. 
• 
 With a number of third-party apps, customers can enroll in a restaurant’s loyalty 
program. Beacons in the restaurant allow customers to automatically check in and 
receive points for visits and purchases. Beacon-powered loyalty apps are being used 
by a growing number of restaurants. 
 By integrating  beacons and proximity into mobile solutions, leading restaurants are streamlining 
and improving order accuracy, saving customers’ precious time and enhancing diners’ experience. These 
customer-centric innovations are also boosting orders and average ticket size, which improves margins 
and profitability. Loyal customers also appreciate the seamless recognition and rewards that beacons 
automatically enable, strengthening customer loyalty, persistence, and advocacy. 
 Retailers Are Combining Digital and Physical Shopping 
 With beacons  integrated into their platforms, retailers from Europe’s Carrefour 27 to CVS 28 , Barney’s 29 are 
providing timely, relevant offers that customers value and respond to. In the early days of location-based 
advertising, one of the oft-mentioned scenarios depicted consumers walking past Starbucks and receiving 
an offer to purchase a coffee or latte. Fortunately, the wisdom of bombarding consumers with unsolicited, 
untargeted offers has been roundly critiqued and the scenario debunked. In virtually every category, brick 
and mortar retailers face two critical challenges—how to attract more shoppers to their stores more often, 
and how to generate more sales from customers who visit their stores. Since malls and shopping centers are 
dependent on their stores success, these questions are equally if not more important for Westfield, Simon, 
and other properties.

CHAPTER 20 ■ WHERE BEACONS ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE
354
 While mobile and beacons are critical parts of the solution, determining the most appropriate 
use-case(s) and strategy for a particular retailer is complicated by a number of factors.
• 
 “Retail” encompasses a broad category of very different types of stores. While there 
are similarities, the differences between a Macy’s and a 7-Eleven, not to mention 
Home Depot, Costco, Walgreens, and other types of stores, require different 
approaches. 
• 
 In addition to differences across store types, shoppers’ needs and interests vary 
across segments (teens vs. adults), time (hour, day of week, and season), and 
occasion (e.g., a fill-in trip to the grocery store versus shopping for a party prior to 
the big game).  
• 
 Shopper needs even vary in the same store. For example, in a department store such 
as Macy’s, consumers shopping for a product such as mattresses have requirements 
and expectations that are very different from shoppers, say, in the cosmetics 
department. 
• 
 Even within the same store type and same category, customers may be browsing to 
see what’s new, researching products and brands, searching for specific item 
(or set of items), or simply comparing prices on a product and brand they’ve already 
decided to purchase. 
 While the intensity of  competition also varies, brick and mortar retailers are under intense pressure 
Amazon and other online competitors to improve shoppers’ experience. Consumers view shopping online 
much more favorably than shopping in stores—in fact, Amazon enjoys a 2:1 “favorability margin 30 ” over 
the average brick and mortar retailer. Sales from the recent holiday season showed the power of Amazon’s 
appeal, in particular—the online leader accounted for nearly 43% 31  of e-commerce sales. 
 Amazon has built its formidable franchise by removing sources of friction and personalizing and 
enriching shoppers’ experience. While pioneering one-click shopping, Amazon continues to make 
shopping easier with services such as subscriptions for reordering regularly purchased products, Prime 
subscriptions for next day ordering, same day delivery and others. Amazon is also the undisputed leader in 
personalization, presenting on its opening page no less than eight different personalized options to entice 
consumers to shop. 
 In contrast, with the typical brick and mortar retailer, a shopper may have received an e-mail in their 
inbox, picked up at entrance to the store one of the ubiquitous circulars showing items on sale, and scanned 
a directory or signage pointing to specific departments. Retailers offer little if any personalization that 
makes in-store shopping easier, more enjoyable, and productive. In terms of integrating digital and mobile 
solutions into the shopping experience, brick and mortar retailers to date have barely scratched the surface. 
 Integrated with mobile apps, beacons play a vital role in removing frictions and personalizing shoppers’ 
experience. Consider the following examples, all enabled by beacons and a retailer’s own or third-party 
mobile app:
• 
 Like Amazon, beacons can show and direct consumers to the best deals throughout 
the store and in specific departments. 
• 
 Like Kmart’s BLUE LIGHT specials, beacons can direct shoppers to items that are 
available in limited quantities or on sale for a limited time.

• 
 In combination with beacons, a shopping list prepared online or based on previous 
purchases, can guide a shopper through the store. As the customer navigates down 
an aisle, the app can display items on the list as well as related, complementary, or 
alternative items. 
• 
 With beacons pinpointing a shopper’s location down to the aisle, the app can display 
trending items in the department, reviews from previous buyers, as well as online 
items not available in the store. 
• 
 A customer’s purchases can be held for pickup or delivered to their home. As 
customers approach merchandise pickup, a beacon signal can prompt the staff to 
retrieve their order, streamlining fulfillment and reducing wait times. 
• 
 While viewing a product in the store, shoppers can use the app to request assistance 
from a salesperson or remote support team.    
 Imagine the power of beacon- powered shopping apps when combined on an opt-in basis with 
a customer’s preferences and past purchases. In essence, the combination provides Amazon-like 
personalization to deliver frictionless, rewarding shopping experiences in stores. Retailers are also utilizing 
beacons to help customers navigate to specific departments or find specific items and reward customers for 
visiting the store and specific departments. 
 In virtually every category, leading retailers as well as malls in North America, Europe, and Asia 32 are 
deploying and experimenting with ways to integrate beacons into their mobile solutions, enhancing the 
shopping experience. Leading retailers deploying beacons include CVS, Rite Aid 33 , Macy’s 34  and Target. 
Clearly, careful thought and planning 35 are required to avoid spamming customers with irrelevant and 
unsolicited offers and instead provide timely, relevant content, offers, and services that customers welcome. 
 Enterprise: Automating and Verifying Field Inspections 
 Most discussions related to  beacons center around consumer applications. A number of significant 
applications are emerging within enterprises as well, particularly in industries that have equipment in the 
field that require periodic inspections. Consider for a moment the vast number of fire extinguishers. They 
are on every floor of every office and commercial building, in elevators, stores, warehouses and factories, 
and in many other places the average person is unaware of. 
 With equipment in the field, regular inspections and maintenance can be critical. For example, in 
the event of a fire, a single, non-working extinguisher can mean the difference between a small, contained 
fire that is quickly extinguished with minimal damage and a three-alarm blaze that results in significant 
property damage and puts building occupants at risk. While inspections may seem to be routine, they can 
have serious, even life and death consequences. As a result, there are strict industry regulations governing 
compliance and vendors and customers must carefully monitor the status and working condition of 
extinguishers in the field.

356
 Despite advances in technology,  inspections and maintenance in many fields are still performed 
manually, in much the same way they’ve always been. While the process varies across vendors and owners, 
the process for inspecting extinguishers typically consists of the following:
• 
 On a regularly scheduled basis, inspectors travel to locations and physically inspect 
the devices. 
• 
 At the beginning of a shift, inspectors are given a list, generally on paper, with the 
location, age, and other information specific to each extinguisher scheduled for 
inspection that day. 
• 
 In each location, the inspector examines the extinguishers, the cases in which they 
are housed, user instructions, and any other materials to confirm that extinguishers 
are visible, accessible, and in proper working condition. 
• 
 If there is an issue that needs to be addressed, the inspector either corrects the 
problem or initiates a work order to fix or replace the unit. 
• 
 The inspector then notes the time and disposition of the inspection, again, generally 
on paper. 
 Enterprises and their vendors are rapidly equipping field inspectors with mobile devices and solutions, 
shifting from paper-based tasks to digital systems. 
 As it turns out, beacons are a perfect  complement  to mobile field inspections. From fire extinguishers to 
railway equipment, enterprises are streamlining and improving the process of inspections, as the following 
case, complements of SAP, illustrates:
• 
 A large industrial enterprise can have hundreds of fire extinguishers in a single 
facility, and many thousands across facilities spread around the globe. Given the 
associated risks, inspecting and keeping extinguishers in working order is a mission-
critical safety process. 
• 
 Installed in each unit, beacons can be integrated into a mobile inspection app, 
allowing the app to “recognize” each extinguisher in close proximity.  
• 
 By pinpointing the exact location of each unit, the beacon-powered app reduces 
the amount of time inspectors spend searching and ensures that units are not 
overlooked. 
• 
 As an inspector approaches a particular extinguisher, its beacon triggers the app to 
recognize the unit and pull up a pre-populated template with information specific 
to that unit. This “automatic detection” reduces time as well as errors that can 
arise as inspectors check and verify the serial number, compare it to specs on their 
worksheet, etc. 
• 
 Beacons also provide independent verification that each extinguisher was indeed 
inspected by confirming that the inspector was in its presence for a designated 
amount of time on a particular date. 
• 
 Finally, any issues that require follow up can be communicated instantly to a 
dispatcher, along with specifics describing the problem. When a maintenance 
person is dispatched, the beacon in the extinguisher allows the unit to be located 
and repaired more quickly and easily.

 For a short demo of this application, see the “Proximity Aware SAP Work Manager” video 36 on YouTube, 
courtesy of SAP. Another example illustrating the compelling application and benefits for a UK railway 
company is provided by Mubaloo 37 . 
 Extinguishers represent just  one of many examples of equipment in the field. Across commercial, transit 
and industrial applications, the number of pieces of equipment in the field requiring regular inspection and 
maintenance is staggering. Fail-safe compliance is often critical and mistakes can be costly, even deadly, 
thus exposing the manufacturer, building owners, and companies to huge liabilities. Integrating mobile and 
beacon technologies bring much needed automation and consistency to field inspections. 
 Summary 
 The examples in this chapter provide convincing evidence that beacons, properly integrated with mobile 
solutions, are transforming customer experience and improving marketing, operations, and customer 
service across verticals. The examples represent a sample of a larger set of use-cases, all illustrating the value 
of beacons. 
 Despite these successes, beacon deployments and integration are not without challenges and risks. 
While many companies are treading ahead deliberately and experimenting, others have forged ahead 
without adequately developing a strategy to solve significant problems and deliver compelling use-cases. 
 Figure  20-1  shows a matrix highlighting the most compelling  applications , from a list of 30, across the 
five verticals. A full list of applications across some 20+ verticals is available on request from the author 38 . 
While specific use-cases vary across verticals, in general successful applications are delivering compelling 
solutions on one or more of the following dimensions of the PEER framework 39 :
• 
 Personalize —As illustrated by applications in retail and attractions, beacons allow 
apps to deliver personalized, highly relevant content, messages, offers, and services 
that consumers appreciate, value, and respond to. 
• 
 Enable —By removing frictions and making apps “smarter,” beacon-powered mobile 
solutions are helping consumers accomplish tasks more easily and effortlessly, from 
shopping and browsing to ordering, paying, and more. Navigating through a busy 
airport to catch a flight is a classic and compelling example, but there are many other 
“frictions” waiting to be removed. 
• 
 Enhance —By extracting insights from anonymized patterns of behavior over 
time, innovative beacon-powered apps can surprise and delight consumers. For 
example, displaying comments from previous users “in the moment” are making the 
experience in an attraction even more memorable. Businesses and consumers are 
just beginning to appreciate the power of fusing the digital and physical. However, 
once experienced, neither will want to revert to the status quo.  
• 
 Reward —By recognizing loyal customers, beacon-powered apps can automate and 
deliver privileges, recognition, rewards, and other incentives valued by customers. 
This capability gives brands and companies a powerful new set of tools to compete 
for consumers’ attention and affection.

 Of course, the prospects and ultimate value of these solutions are in the hands of brands, retailers, 
developers, and technology partners. Based on the use-cases and momentum, the future for beacons and 
proximity-enabled apps is bright.

 CHAPTER 21  
 Using Beacons in Payments 
 Steve Statler and Kris Kolodziej, President of IndoorLBS 
 “Money often costs too much.” 
—Ralph Waldo Emerson 
 Afghanistan 
 Mobile payments  are a battleground, not unlike … Afghanistan. It’s an area of strategic importance, where 
the conflict seems unending, and the battle involves both super powers and smaller actors using guerilla 
tactics. Some of the most powerful have failed to conquer this domain, and yet they continue to try. What are 
they fighting for and why is it so hard? 

CHAPTER 21 ■ USING BEACONS IN PAYMENTS
360
 The Afghan terrain frustrated the British, the Russians, and the Americans. Mobile payments frustrated 
the multi-billion-dollar behemoth that is Google. Despite its massive resources and the IQ of its employees, 
Google Wallet was defeated, not by another technology super power, but by the hostility of the locals—the 
retailers—who didn’t trust them and saw only an organization trying to encroach, uninvited, into their territory. 
 In 2010, three of the largest U.S. mobile carriers—AT&T, T-Mobile USA, and Verizon—formed an 
alliance called Isis (you couldn’t make this up) and were repelled for many reasons, including a struggle to 
work with the locals while trying to apply their own rules to this unfamiliar area. Even a coalition of retailers 
(MCX), native to the region, has struggled. A number of their leaders have been terminated, and they have 
found the terrain very challenging. 
 Like Afghanistan, payments are  Balkanized regionally. Each country’s payments industry is different, 
with its own laws and customs. Sure, there are players that work across regions, but conquering one doesn’t 
mean you can retain control of them all. When you look at the dynamics within the regions, there are a 
multitude of networks, with strange names and customs. 
 Beacons and Mobile Payments 
 So what’s all this got to do with beacons? Beacons and retail are synonymous, and payments are the strategic 
heart of retail. After all, what is retail if it’s not about the acceptance of payment for goods? The global 
payments industry is a 1.7 trillion dollar business 1 and is growing rapidly. If you control payments, you have 
extraordinary insights into who is buying what. This “attribution” that can provide proof of the value of 
marketing spending enables a string of businesses where beacons are key. The prize is big. Beacons can help 
target shoppers. They can help to engage them, and, if the right integration with payments is there, they can 
help prove that the money spent on the first steps resulted in a sale. 
 Many solutions  developers have used beacons as a differentiator for their attacks on the payments 
space. We will look at a number of examples of those. 
 A payments system is built on many things—security, regulation, technology—but one of the most 
entrancing and elusive aspects is the user experience. 
 A Change Ready to Happen 
 The  United States has been stuck in the dark ages of payments, being one of the last countries to move away 
from magnetic stripe cards. This is problematic because of the significant levels of fraud that comes with it, 
which is almost three times that of the European Union 2 , where mag stripe has long been made obsolete by 
more secure EMV 3 chip technology. One of the reasons for this resistance to change is that the mag stripe 
experience is pretty good. So the challenge for mobile payments is, can we do better? Beacons may hold an 
answer to that. 
 We have seen beacon-enabled mobile payment experiences that are exceptional. While progress in the 
 United States is slow, there are projects in Turkey and Denmark where beacons are being used at scale. This 
is important to understand when deciding if paying by beacon is worthwhile. Even though Apple Pay has a 
lot of momentum, there are still actors that have plans in play. We could still see beacons earn a significant 
place as part of mobile payments systems around the world.

referred to as “chip and PIN”.  

CHAPTER 21 ■ USING BEACONS IN PAYMENTS

 Why Mobile Payments? 
 It’s easy to understand why Google, a business founded on advertising, would find mobile wallets 
interesting. A mobile wallet can provide a valuable place to present more  advertising and to measure the 
effect of the advertising that has been presented elsewhere. The carriers’ motivation is clear; they are central 
to mobility and so have a claim on a share of the revenues coming from this new territory. Why have the 
retailers fought for control so fiercely? Is it just a lack of trust in Google and the phone companies? That 
might be part of it, but there is more to it than that. 
 The introduction of mobile payments is seen as a once in a generation disruptive event, a transition in 
power. There is the opportunity to break the hold of a system that merchants see as unfair and replace it with 
something that is just. 
 The Curse of Interchange 4 
 Imagine a service that you have to use where you don’t even get to agree on the price, where your supplier 
has full control of the price you pay. That’s how  retailers   see the credit card business. Retailers have to accept 
credit cards, otherwise customers will stay away. When they sign up to accept payments via a card network, 
merchants have to agree to pay swipe fees that vary in ways they can’t control. 
 The banks that issue the cards to shoppers offer air miles and money back rewards as an incentive to 
grow their base of cardholders. Yet, it’s not the card issuers that fund those rewards. That money comes out 
of the pockets of the retailer who is obliged to pay the interchange or swipe fees.  Gas stations can pay as 
much as three dollars on a tank of gas for the privilege of accepting your American Express card. It’s their 
largest expense, along with labor. 5 
 Few retailers can refuse to accept credit cards, but, with the advent of mobile wallets, if those wallets were to 
link our bank accounts with their back accounts without a credit card involved, those retailers could save billions. 
 One of the main technologies at the heart of mobile wallets is  NFC  . Beyond the RFID radio that is part of 
NFC is a card emulation protocol that makes the phone behave like a credit card, as far as the point of sale is 
concerned. This may sound like a sensible way of maintaining continuity with the current systems: a smooth 
migration from payment with cards to payment with phones. To a retailer, this looks like a continuation of 
the system of oppression they are trying to escape. 
 Will Mobile Break the Curse? 
 Retailers have become interested in mobile payment apps that use means other than the credit card 
networks to transfer funds. 
 Starbucks mobile app has been one of the most successful examples of what is possible. With 7 million 
transactions a week, it accounts for 16 percent of all of Starbucks purchase transactions. The experience is a 
differentiator. Rather than NFC, the Starbucks app uses a QR code displayed on the phone (or Apple Watch), 
which is read by the point of sale optical scanner, to trigger a cloud payment. The payment for a coffee comes from 
a stored value account that has been pre-paid by the customer with a credit card. This experience not only helps 
to build loyalty, it also significantly reduces the credit card interchange costs. The credit card fee is only incurred 
once when the sorted value account is credited. Then whenever the app is used for individual payments, spending 
down from that lump sum, the credit card networks are not involved and the transaction costs become negligible.  
 4 If you are one of the odd folks who find the topic of payments to be fascinating and you want to learn more, check out 
“Payments Systems in the U.S.,” by Carol Coye Benson et al.  
 5 The card networks such as MasterCard, Visa, and American Express, have a different perspective on the value they bring 
to retailers. They would point out that credit cards reduce friction in the sales process and encourage customers to spend 
more at a retailer, that there is a “cost of cash” (counting, secure transfers, risk of theft) and that card networks insulate 
merchants from card fraud.

 Isis Versus Starbucks 
 When Isis did their  trials with Jamba Juice, their experience didn’t go so well. The telcos behind Isis required 
users of their wallet to jump through hoops before they could even start to use their payment system. Hoops 
like visiting a carrier store to have a special version of their SIM card installed, a confusing process for both 
customers and staff. Visiting these stores, waiting to be served, and explaining what you are trying to do to 
someone who may not have been well trained is not high on anyone’s list of favorite ways to spend time. It’s 
down there with a trip to the dentist. 
 After running the gauntlet at their local carrier store, the number of people who were in a position to 
then use the Isis wallet was many orders of magnitude smaller than those willing to use Starbucks’ wallet/
app. To compound this, the average customer’s frequency of visits to buy juice is lower than visits to buy 
coffee. The result was that so few people used the service that the staff working at Jamba Juice did not 
become familiar with accepting the new payment method and confusion reigned. 
 To change habits, you have to focus on a something that happens frequently. Payments are a habit; 
we do it without thinking. When we have to think, things happen more slowly, and that impacts the user 
experience and increases wait times at the cash register. 
 Proximity Has its Perks 
 Starbucks proved that a mobile purchase experience based on QR codes can be phenomenally successful. 
Could we do better with Bluetooth beacons? The experience using  Qualcomm’s   Perks app tells us that the 
answer is a resounding “Yes!” 
 Within one month of launching a Bluetooth beacon-enabled payment app, 20% of all the transactions 
at the café where it was deployed were being conducted using “beacon payments.” In a fraction of the time, 
more people were using beacons to pay than Starbucks achieved over a period of several years. 
 The experience was magical. While beacons unlocked the magic, and users received loyalty points that 
earned them a free drink, the real joy came from the purchase experience. The experience resembled what 
it might have been like as a local at a small town store, being treated like a regular, being served faster, and 
having to do next to nothing to pay. 
 Perks is a café in the massive Qualcomm headquarters lobby. It’s busy, with two  point of sale (PoS) 
terminals and a steady stream of  Qualcommers and visitors buying Pete’s Coffee, snacks, and meals. Users of 
the app registered their credit card details on the web and downloaded an app that gave them three ways to 
pay. They could scan a QR code at the point of sale, tap an NFC tag, or leave their phone in their pocket and 
ask to “pay by beacon.” 
 As you approach the  PoS , your name and photo appeared on an iPad sitting next to the PoS, courtesy 
of the beacon. This enabled the barista to greet you by name. If several people paying by beacon were in 
front of the PoS, their pictures were ordered based on the signal strength being measured. The name of the 
person in front of the queue appeared first on the tablet. The beacons allowed the system to scale over two 
point of sale terminals. The customers lining up in front of one terminal were not visible on the tablet that 
was associated with the other terminal. This ability to scale over multiple PoS devices with beacons is key to 
deployments in larger retail environments 6 . 
 6 Pulling this off isn’t a given. One of the issues with the PayPal beacon experience (as tested at Toys-R-Us) was that 
the system had problems distinguishing which PoS customers were paying at. The reasons for that issue are a matter 
for speculation, but could be due to the beacon design, beacon placement, the transmission strength, and the way their 
orchestration layer applied (or failed to apply) heuristics to manage any ambiguity. 

CHAPTER 21 ■ USING BEACONS IN PAYMENTS
363
 For many customers who had been visiting Perks for years, using the Perks app was the first time they 
had been greeted by name. Guess what they did when that happened? They smiled. Guess what the barista 
did? They smiled back. You could have finished the trial there and it would already have been considered a 
success in terms of building loyalty and improving service. 
 But it got better. Once the greeting was taken care of, the customer ordered their drink, the barista 
entered the amount the drink cost on the iPad, this deducted the value from the customer’s card, and then 
the barista entered the transaction a second time on the legacy point of sale terminal 7 . The customer picked 
up the drink and continued their conversation with their colleague or guest. Just to recap, the barista is 
having to double the data entry they would normally perform, by entering the amount into the iPad and the 
 PoS  . However, the customers are doing a lot less; well, nothing, really, other than ordering, agreeing to pay, 
and collecting their drinks. 
 There was a fear that this double entry would slow things down, that the baristas might not like having 
to do more work. But the reverse was true: lines moved faster, because it’s the customer that slows things 
down. The baristas loved it. They liked being smiled at and having less stress with long lines, and they 
quickly got used to the simple system. 
 You may wonder how many people used the NFC tap or the QR code versus “pay by beacon”. Almost 
everyone used the beacon. Tapping and scanning may not seem like a lot of work, but compared to “doing 
nothing” and keeping your phone in your pocket with the beacon, it wasn’t even close. 
 Beacon Cloud Payment Flow 
 It’s helpful to understand an example of the steps to making beacon-triggered  cloud payments   happen. 8 
Let’s walk through the nine steps illustrated in Figure  21-1 .
 
 1. 
  The customer downloads the payment app and enters their payment card details 
via a secure web form 9 . The card details are stored in a vault that is PCI DSS 
compliant 10 . 
 
 2. 
 The customer’s phone (with the payment app installed) sees the beacon situated 
next to the point of sale. 
 
 3. 
 The app sends the UUID of the beacon 11 up to the cloud service to indicate which 
point of sale terminal the customer is standing in front of. 
 
 4. 
 The cloud service understands that beacon 1234 is associated with PoS #2 at the 
Perks Café, at a given address, and sends the photo and name associated with the 
customer’s account to the point of sale. 
 7 Since this was a pilot project the beacon function wasn’t integrated with the legacy PoS, which continued to operate as if 
the beacon system didn’t exist. A PoS integration would have taken too long to organize. Pay-by-beacon transactions 
were rung up as if they were being paid via a coupon on the legacy PoS so they could be tracked. Entering the transaction 
a second time on the iPad initiated the transfer of funds from the customer’s credit card to a holding account. The funds 
from the beacon system were then periodically transferred to the café, so the operator could take receipt of those funds 
and balance their books. If the system had gone into production, the cloud payments system would have been integrated 
into the legacy PoS so that double entry was no longer necessary. 
 8 This is not exactly how the Perks system was implemented—that’s confidential—but it provides a simplified sense of 
how a beacon-triggered, cloud-based wallet can work.  
 9 This includes the payment card number. The first six digits of this are the Bank Identification Number (BIN), which 
indicates the type of card and the bank that issued it. The rest of the payment card number is the Primary Account 
Number (PAN), which identifies the cardholder’s account at the bank.  
 10 PCI DSS is the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard defined by the card issuers and used to regulate the 
security of all the systems used to store, transmit, and process payments.  
 11 The actual UUID may be obfuscated via access control. 

CHAPTER 21 ■ USING BEACONS IN PAYMENTS

 5. 
 The barista verifies that the customer is the person whose name and photo are 
showing on the point of sale, or the tablet next to it, and enters the amount they 
agreed to pay. This is sent back to the cloud service. 
 
 6. 
 The cardholder ID is used to retrieve the payment card details. 
 
 7. 
 These card details, or a token that corresponds to the card details, are sent to the 
acquiring bank or payments processor that the merchant uses. That processor 
uses the appropriate payments network, e.g. Visa, to verify that the customer can 
pay and sends the transaction through the payment network so funds from the 
customer’s account will be deposited into the merchant’s account. 
 
 8. 
 The acquiring bank or  processor confirms back to the application cloud service 
that the payment request was successful. 
 
 9. 
 The cloud service signals to the point of sale that the payment was successful and 
the barista hands over the drink to the customer. 
 No More Perks 
 Alas, the Perks pilot is no more. The adoption numbers speak for themselves, but you had to be there to 
appreciate the magic of the experience. It’s hard to point to a good reason as to why the pilot didn’t go into 
production, other than that Qualcomm is in the beacon business, not the point of sale business. Square had 
a similar service, but without Bluetooth beacons, their location fix wasn’t accurate enough for the system to 
scale in a multi-checkout environment, or in urban areas where their GPS location didn’t function well.

 Google has been conducting their own pilot of “ hands-free payments ” in San Francisco with 
McDonald’s and Papa John’s 12 . Hopefully, this will be a better time and place to see the hands-free approach 
take off.  
 Card Not Present Impacts Cloud Payments 
 The riskiest scenario for use of cards in  payments is what is called “Card Not Present”. There is significantly 
more fraud if a merchant accepts payment with a card number from a customer over the phone or online, 
where the card is not present at the merchant’s site. As a result, the payment networks increase the 
interchange costs. The amount varies based on a set of arcane criteria, driven by the kind of retailer 13 that 
is receiving the payment. The increase in interchange is significant relative to the razor-thin margin most 
retailers live on. 
 For payment by beacon, this is an important issue to consider. If the card being used has been registered 
online for use in a beacon-based payment use-case such as Perks, that transaction is classified as Card Not 
Present, even though the customer is present. 
 The net of this is that a cloud-based  wallet can significantly push up the interchange costs for a retailer. 
At least, that would be the case if a credit card transaction occurs every time a payment is made. If you take 
the Starbucks approach and debit a lump sum as a top-up into a pre-paid or stored value system, the fact that 
the card fee for the top-up is charged at Card Not Present rates is less material, so long as the pre-payment can 
be amortized over several transactions. For example, if a Card Not Present transaction to top up a Starbucks 
account with $100 costs two dollars, but that $100 lasts for 20 purchases of coffee paid from the prepaid 
account, which might cost five cents a transaction to use, then the net transaction cost per coffee is just 15 cents 
per transaction, which is a lot less than Starbucks would pay if a customer paid for each drink with their credit 
card. As a result, Starbucks reduces the overhead of conventional card payments by using a cloud-based wallet. 
 Of course, if a bank is operating the  cloud payment   system, they may get to change the rules to 
eliminate the Card Not Present charge. 
 Fragmentation and the Point of Sale 
 One of the challenges with  developing wireless payments systems is that, for the deepest level of 
functionality and control of the user experience, you need to integrate with the point of sale. However, the 
way we pay in different kinds of stores varies significantly, making this difficult. Depending on the kind 
of store, the point of sale vendors vary and the flow of control between the payment network, bank, and 
merchant changes. The systems used are different for vending machines, big box stores, grocery, gas pumps, 
self-service cafes, mass transit, and restaurants. 
 Think about what has to happen if, at a gas station, you “put $30 on pump seven,” compared with 
the purchase of groceries at a market. The first requires a pre-authorization of funds to make sure the 
customer has $30 to spend, and then an actual payment amount that is posted based on signals from the fuel 
dispenser. The grocery transaction is a lot more straightforward. The cost of the groceries is totaled and a 
payment request is sent over the card network.

 There are dozens of different  PoS vendors across these sub-verticals within retail. These PoS vendors 
are gatekeepers for aspiring beacon payments providers. Think of them as trolls guarding a bridge to a castle. 
Only, these trolls are busy, with a backlog of features, and will need to be convinced that working with a 
new payments player is worth delaying the implementation of other features for their customers. Solution 
designers need to have a plausible case for how they are going to help the PoS vendors make money. If you 
want to integrate beacons into vending machines, the PoS hardware may be from Crane or USA Technologies. 
For gas pumps and C-Stores, it’s Gilbarco, VeriFone, and Wayne. Food service is very fragmented, but Micros 
are the dominant player. For specialty retail, speak to Epicor, and for grocery, speak to NCR. 
 The other issue is that there can be fragmentation of different PoS systems used across even a single 
merchant’s stores. This is more common than you might think, with the exception of some of the very largest 
merchants who own the PoS software they use (McDonald’s or 7-Eleven, for instance). Many chains have a 
potpourri of different systems they use. This is especially true for franchise businesses like fast food or gas 
stations, where the PoS is owned by the franchisee rather than by the retailer brand. 
 You can see that having a vertical focus is important if you are going to make progress in the payments 
market. Either that, or deep pockets and powerful friends. Otherwise, you could have a wonderful payment 
app that can’t actually work with the systems that are operating in retail stores. 
 Despite all these challenges, there are  examples of real progress with Bluetooth beacons helping to 
improve the way we pay. 
 MobilePay: Danske Bank in Denmark 
 In the United States, “banks have been backward in coming forward” with mobile payments systems. This 
is a shame because they have strength in two things that are essential for conquering this new frontier: trust 
and relationships. That trust and credibility puts them in a great position to bring customers, retailers, and 
payment infrastructure providers together. 
 As an example, Danske  Bank has achieved more in mobile payments than most. They are the largest 
bank in Denmark, with a 28% market share in a country of 5.7 million people. They also have a significant 
presence in a number of other markets. Their MobilePay app (shown in Figure  21-2 ) is deployed in Norway, 
Finland, and Denmark. Danske Bank has put their full force behind the app and the numbers speak for 
themselves. MobilePay transactions more than doubled from 7 billion Kroner ($980m) in 2014, to 18B Kr or 
($2.5B) in 2015. There were over 10 million MobilePay transactions in the month of December 2015 alone. 
 Figure 21-2.    The MobilePay app being used with a MobilePay beacon at a Bilka store 
 

CHAPTER 21 ■ USING BEACONS IN PAYMENTS
367
 MobilePay is accepted across a  range of retail segments (Figure  21-3 ), including vending machines 
(tanning booths), big box electronics, groceries, transportation systems, and quick serve restaurants 
(QSR, or fast food to you and me), including McDonald’s, Starbucks, Burger King, and convenience stores 
such as 7-Eleven. 
 Danske Bank is using  MobilePay as a way of engaging younger customers who have a greater affinity 
with paying by phone, where “oldsters” may argue that cards are just as convenient, assuming you own a 
wallet or purse to hold the cards in. 
 This convenience aspect is key. In many parts of the world, contactless payments using NFC-enabled 
cards are becoming commonplace. This allows someone who has remembered to bring their card to tap 
it on an NFC-enabled PoS terminal and pay for small ticket items (~$50 or less) without needing to use a 
PIN or having to slot the card into the EMV card readers that U.S. citizens are just starting to get used to. 
 Figure 21-3.  A MobilePay beacon paired with a point-of-sale terminal  
 

CHAPTER 21 ■ USING BEACONS IN PAYMENTS
368
That’s a tough bar to compete with, as far as convenience goes, but MobilePay supports payments that go 
beyond small ticket. The payment flow has been key to the success of MobilePay in grocery stores. 
 At a grocery store, a  MobilePay customer can tap their phone on a MobilePay beacon and enter their 
PIN in advance of all their groceries being scanned. When it comes time to agree on the total price, a single 
swipe on their phone authorizes the payment. This has the potential to speed up the payment process and 
shorten lines compared to a card payment process that requires a PIN to be entered for larger transactions 
and is backloaded to the end of the checkout process, just when the patience of the people behind you is 
shortest and you want to get away. 
 Net Clearance is the San Diego-based company that produces the wireless hardware and middleware 
that enables MobilePay. They manufacture all the hardware used for MobilePay and their other customers 
locally in San Diego. Their CEO estimates that, in the grocery store payment scenario, using their app can 
reduce payment times by 30 seconds per customer, and that, in some locations, in particular some grocery 
stores, their transaction share is up to two thirds of all payments because of this. 
 On the technical side,  MobilePay offers the same “trifecta” of technologies that Perks used: QR-codes, 
NFC, and Bluetooth, plus Wi-Fi. Android and Microsoft Windows phones can be tapped on the NFC tag, 
which kickstarts the app. iOS phones use Bluetooth to make the association between phone and PoS. The 
payment credentials are sent either via NFC or Bluetooth in the case of iOS. The final authorization is done 
using a cloud connection, which could be via Wi-Fi or a cellular connection. 
 Over 200 PoS system brands are integrated with MobilePay, which is a major achievement. This enables 
over 30,000 retailers to use the system. One of the reasons for this level of adoption is that the system 
bypasses the credit card networks that are the cause of so much discontent in the retailer community. 
Transactions are brokered between the merchants and the individual customer’s accounts, avoiding the 
large interchange fees that fuel the credit card system. 
 The issue with banks offering payment apps is that this can potentially be a source of market 
fragmentation. No merchant wants to support a payment system that only works for a subset of its customers 
who use a specific bank. In the United States, there are tens of thousands of banks and credit unions. To 
work around this, Danske Bank offers its service not just to its own customers, but to those of its competitors 
too, a smart move which helps it build its brand and acceptance of the app across the entire market of users 
in its regions. 
 Other benefits of using the  app are the ability to track receipts without collecting scraps of paper, and 
significant money back on transactions at some stores. The collection of receipts is a non-trivial feature. 
A feature you don’t get from Google or Apple Pay. In the United States, merchants are reluctant to share 
what is called Level Three transaction item data. This requires deeper middleware integrations with the 
point of sale, as well as willingness from merchants to share the data. In return, the retailer receives more 
information from MobilePay about the customer who is making the purchase in their store, something they 
wouldn’t get from a credit card transaction. 
 fastPay in Turkey 
 DenizBank is a Russian owned bank that provides retail banking services in Turkey. Headquartered in 
Istanbul, they are ahead of U.S. banks in offering a proximity-enabled mobile wallet to their customers. 
 fastPay enables peer-to-peer payments between individuals. The app also allows customers to make ATM 
withdrawals without the use of a card. 
 The bank works with Blesh, the Turkish beacon manufacturer, which was one of the first beacon 
vendors to support Google’s Physical Web URI beacons. Blesh iBeacons in DenizBank branches enable 
customers to automatically claim their place in the line for personal service (shown in Figure  21-4 ). 

CHAPTER 21 ■ USING BEACONS IN PAYMENTS
369
 Blesh claims over 10,000 beacons deployed around Turkey, with their top venues being malls and 
supermarkets (28%), cafes and restaurants (17%), and banks (11%). They report the most beacon triggers 
from malls (27%), airports (15%), and cafes (12%). The highest conversion rates for notifications to clicks 
come from cafes (25%), malls (22%), and subways (21%). 
 The fastPay beacons are placed in self- service  cafes across Turkey to enable the push of promotions 
such as a free dessert to passersby (see Figures  21-5 and  21-6 ). 
 Figure 21-4.    On entry to the DenizBank branch, the fastPay app automatically generates the customer’s ticket

 Once lured into the  establishment by the alerts, payments for meals can be made from the table without 
having to wait for service (this is achieved through the direct sending of funds using the app; no beacons are 
involved). Alternatively, the customer can pay “hands-free” without ever having to touch their phone 14 
(see Figure  21-7 ). 
 Merchants use a tablet that  DenizBank provides (shown in Figure  21-8 ), which communicates directly 
with the fastPay app on the customer’s phone to authenticate their presence close to the tablet. Customers 
can then verify their identity and willingness to pay verbally.  
  Figure 21-7.  Customers enter the café with their phones in their purse and the phone detects the Blesh 
beacon and sends the customer’s details to the iPad on the counter of the café without any intervention by the 
customers

372
 The app, like  MobilePay , is available to non-DenizBank customers. The wallet can be linked directly 
to the user’s bank account, or associated with a credit card. The wallet is pre-populated with funds, which 
helps mitigate insufficient funds issues and interchange costs of card transactions. 
 Initial uptake for fastPay has primarily been for self-service cafés where the hands-free component is 
very appealing. The push into other sub-verticals such as grocery is ongoing. 
 Digicash in Luxembourg 
 At the heart of the European  Union , nestled between Germany, France, and Belgium, is Luxembourg. 
The country is 998 square miles with a population of less than half a million. Luxembourg is the site of 
the European Court of Justice, has a national dish called  Bouneschlupp (a soup made with green beans, 
potatoes, bacon, and onions), and a bank-sponsored payment app called Digicash (shown in Figure  21-9 ). 
 Figure 21-8.  The PoS app on the tablet used by the café displays the identity of the customer and allows the 
server to enter the amount to be charged, authorizing the charge based on verbal agreement with the customer 
 

CHAPTER 21 ■ USING BEACONS IN PAYMENTS
373
 The app was launched in 2012 and is promoted by the four main banks in Luxembourg (BCEE, POST 
Luxembourg, BIL, and BGL BNP Paribas). This gives it coverage of 80% of the country’s primary bank 
accounts. It uses SEPA, the Single Euro Payments Area, interbank payment system to send funds, supporting 
both person-to-person and person-to-retailer. A full 8% of the population is estimated to have downloaded 
the app, and 10% of the nation’s point of sales are said to be integrated. 
 The system supports QR  codes , NFC, and Bluetooth beacons using a Digicash device that plugs into the 
PoS. Payment is made using PIN code authentication. The app collects digital receipts and can accumulate 
loyalty points at certain retailers such as the Auchan hypermarket. 
 The solution being offered by Digicash is very similar in architecture and functionality to MobilePay in 
Denmark. The difference is that it is owned by a solution provider that has apparently been very successful 
in recruiting the four major banks in that geography to adopt the same solution. MobilePay, on the other 
hand, is owned by a single bank and is being used by that bank to compete with the other banks in its region. 
 Digicash has yet to achieve the level of consumer adoption that the Danish solution has, despite the 
fact that it is offered by four banks rather than one. It seems that a solution that has direct ownership from 
one bank, that is using it to acquire its competitor’s customers, will be driven harder and enjoy more success 
than a solution that may enhance the service offered by all the country’s banks but isn’t being driven by a 
competitive motive.

 Bluetooth in Apple Wallet 
 Apple Pay is famous for rescuing NFC payments from a near-death experience. The white light had 
appeared, and NFC was wandering toward it, away from the pain, suffering, and neglect it had experienced 
during a difficult childhood spent with Isis and Google Wallet. Then  Apple Pay   arrived and, in the tender 
hands of CEO Tim Cook, NFC was reborn as a quick and convenient way to pay. 
 Anyone counting on the idea of Apple using Bluetooth as the mechanism for cloud payments was 
disappointed, but Bluetooth wasn’t banished from Apple Pay. It lives on thanks to Passbook, a preloaded 
iOS app that presented location-triggered passes (see Figure  21-10 ), which could be coupons and tickets, 
that pop up as alerts on the home screen. Passbook was folded into Apple Wallet, right next to the debit and 
credit cards used for payments. As a result, Bluetooth beacons or GPS coordinates can be used as triggers to 
push the passes onto the lock screen. 
 These passes have a life of their  own within the Wallet. They can be downloaded from web pages, from 
Facebook ads, or from text and e-mail messages. Once the user has added them to the Wallet, they stay there 
until they have been deleted. Until that happens, they can be updated remotely with content controlled from 
a retailer or a brand’s  content management system (CMS) . PassJoy is one of the vendors that produces such 
systems. Figure  21-11 shows a screenshot from that CMS. 
 Figure 21-10.    An Apple Wallet Pass, front and back—the pass can be updated with new images and text from 
a remote server 
 

CHAPTER 21 ■ USING BEACONS IN PAYMENTS
375
 Apple Wallet Passes address the perennial issue of how to get a beacon-enabled app installed on your 
customer’s phone. If they have an iPhone, Apple Wallet is already there, and it’s staying there; they can’t 
delete it. All that is needed is an ad that is compelling enough that they click and add a pass to the Wallet. 
Passes consist of a few images and some HTML, so they are relatively cheap and easy to create. 
 Brands such as Neiman Marcus  have built campaigns around this digital Trojan horse. One of the 
prebuilt options for a pass is to link to a full-blown app that can be directly downloaded from the App Store. 
 Given its low cost and simplicity, this half step toward an app download is an underused tactic. 
 Brixton Pound 
 Brixton  is a district of London famous for its music scene. Major venues include The Brixton Academy and 
The Fridge. David Jones (Bowie) lived his first seven years at 40 Stansfield Road, Brixton. This ethnically 
diverse town has seen more than its fair share of social problems and families living on low incomes. 
 In response to those issues, in 2009 a local  community group developed the Brixton Pound, a currency 
that can only be spent at local stores (see Figure  21-12 ). Approximately 250 local businesses accept the 
currency. 200 of them accept pay-by-text transactions. 
 Figure 21-11.    PassJoy allows beacon triggers to be set for Apple Wallet passes, as well as creating and 
scheduling changes to the content displayed on the passes       
 

CHAPTER 21 ■ USING BEACONS IN PAYMENTS
376
 Having a currency that can only be spent locally helps support local merchants. These funds have been 
measured to stay three times longer in the local community than British Pounds Sterling spent with national 
retail chains. 
 In 2014, a Brixton Pound iOS app was launched. Carrying two currencies was considered cumbersome, 
so the app allowed users to dispense with the Brixton bank notes and use a pre-paid account already setup 
for pay-by-text as a funding source for a Bluetooth beacon application. 
 Users could step inside  an initial set of 30 pilot stores that accepted Brixton Pounds and also had 
Kontakt.io Bluetooth beacons. This would trigger a Brixton Pound shortcut to appear on the lock-screen of 
the phone, so that it was easy to access the payment facilities in the app. 
 The app used a pay-by-text SMS service, which predated the arrival of the beacons. Having the beacons 
in store made it easier to send money than using the basic SMS service. All customers had to do was enter 
the amount they wanted to pay the store. The merchant ID, which would otherwise have to be discovered 
and entered manually in a text message, was automatically selected thanks to the address being broadcast to 
the app from the beacons. 
 The app could also be used by customers to top up their prepaid account while on the go. For 
merchants, it enabled them to create promotional content relevant to their store, that would be displayed 
within the app when the customer entered the store. 
 Alas, the Brixton Pound app is no more, although it is rumored to be returning. The concept was clearly 
cutting edge, and the cause was worthy. Given the cost of app development and the size of the Brixton 
area, it’s understandable that such an effort was not sustainable. Success in payments is all about achieving 
volume.

 There are other payments players who have announced support for  Bluetooth beacons  . They include:

 Paydiant—Acquired by PayPal. Produces white label mobile wallets, works with 
Subway and CurrentC, operated by the MCX consortium 
• 
 Pey—Works with Bitcoin transactions; signed up 50 merchants in Germany 
• 
 TruBeacon—Produces white label payment apps; focuses on U.S. Credit Unions  
• 
 SnapScan—South African-based; introduced SnapBeacons to work with its payment 
app, used by approximately 40 Johannesburg and Cape Town retailers     
 CurrentC or Not CurrentC 
 The biggest wildcard of these is Paydiant and its client, the  Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX)  , with the 
 CurrentC  wallet. MCX’s members include 7-Eleven, Alon Brands, Best Buy, CVS Health, Darden Restaurants, 
HMSHost, Hy-Vee, Lowe’s, Michaels, Publix, Sears Holdings, Shell Oil Products US, Sunoco, Target 
Corporation, and Walmart. 
 Satisfying all of those stakeholders is an incredibly difficult task, given the differences in the 
requirements they have from almost every sector of retail. The organization has been working since 2012 on 
its payments solution. It has been running pilots, most recently in Columbus, Ohio, but has yet to perform 
large-scale deployments. 
 The  CurrentC app is available on the app store and provides payment, offers, and loyalty functions. It 
supports multiple funding sources: checking accounts, gift cards, and the Target credit and debit cards. 
 There has been an  organized campaign of one-star reviews that include some emotional and 
misleading comments from people that appear to object to the idea of retailers working together on a 
payment system and the blocking of Apple Pay by some MCX members. 
 Originally, all of MCX’s members were required to pledge to wait for CurrentC and not support 
competing solutions, but as of early 2016, its largest members, including Walmart, have started to deploy 
their own solutions, as well as Apple Pay and Android Pay. 
 The power of the retailers that belong to MCX is awesome, in the non-Millennial sense of the word. 
It’s tempting to write off the effort because of the scale and the failures of Isis and Google Wallet that have 
preceded it. However, the MCX investors have a “right to win,” and they have the expertise, deep pockets, 
and motivation needed to exercise that right. 

CHAPTER 21 ■ USING BEACONS IN PAYMENTS
378
 Summary 
 For those of us that love a challenge, the lure of mobile payments is hard to resist. There are huge rewards for 
winning, both in terms of the fees that can be charged and the intelligence that can be gained by seeing who 
is buying what and why. 
 The move to mobile payments represents a potential disruption, an opportunity to change who controls 
the reigns of power and lift the interchange “tax” on the retailers. Will the credit card networks keep their 
hold and retain their place, or will the new systems linking banks and merchants more directly prevail? In 
some countries it looks as though the coup will succeed. Here in the United States, it seems like the card 
networks will prevail. 
 The opportunity for change goes beyond monetary and strategic value, though. There is a chance to 
change the way millions of people pay for goods and services every day and to make their experience better. 
This seems to be a battle worth fighting. Bluetooth, combined with other wireless technologies, has an 
exciting role to play as part of that revolution.

 CHAPTER 22  
 The Future, Standards, and IP: 
Please Stop Killing Us 
    An open letter to Tim Cook, CEO, Apple and Larry Page, CEO, Alphabet 
 —Dear Larry and Tim, 
 Executive Summary 
 Apple and Google are pursuing a course that could cost lives, and one that risks the future of the Bluetooth 
beacon ecosystem. The remedy, which is within your companies’ control, is inexpensive, good for your 
businesses, and will save the lives of thousands of people. 

CHAPTER 22 ■ THE FUTURE, STANDARDS, AND IP: PLEASE STOP KILLING US
380
 Bluetooth  beacons  are set to drastically improve the accuracy of the cell phone 911 system. 
Unfortunately, the way your companies have approached developing competing proprietary standards for 
Bluetooth beacons is defeating that initiative and also putting the breaks on the development of this key part 
of the Internet of Things. 
 The root of the problem is that, despite popular belief to the contrary, there is no Bluetooth standard for 
beacons. Instead, your companies’ proprietary standards have influenced an ecosystem that, while it seems 
to be healthy, is flawed and fractured. Given the strategic importance of the mobile OS, your companies are 
the only ones that can solve the issue. 
 Please encourage your teams to do the right thing and cooperate on open  Bluetooth beacon standards . 
If they do, chances are that some major issues in the e911 system can be resolved quite rapidly, which will 
allow the Bluetooth beacon ecosystem to be resuscitated from its current lethargic state. This would also 
boost mobile advertising revenues and make smartphones even more useful than they already are, which 
should, in turn, should drive up your sales. 
 There are over 146 million wireless 911 calls per year in the United States. If you are outdoors when 
disaster strikes, the e911 system does a pretty good job of sending your location to first responders. Those 
systems stop working well indoors, which is where we seem to spend a lot of our time these days. In addition 
to the well known issues with GPS indoors (it doesn’t work at all), the current system has no way of knowing 
what floor an emergency caller is on in a multi-story building. You, like me, are probably at the age where 
your friends are starting to worry about their health, and all the things that can suddenly, dramatically 
change it. As the doctor of a friend of mine who almost died of a stroke said, “Time equals brain.” Even a few 
minutes of delay getting patients to the hospital can drastically impact their chances of recovering. 
 A Lost Opportunity 
 These issues have caused a bit of an uproar, so the FCC and CTIA have agreed that, by 2017, 40% of all cell 
phone 911 calls will have a “ dispatchable address ” (as opposed to a latitude and longitude), including a floor 
number. An improvement to be sure, but still not so good if you are in the other 60%. So you may want to cut 
down on your salt intake until 2021, when the target goes up to 80%. 
 So how are the phone companies going to meet these targets? The good news is they have already 
started working together on it. They are building a National Emergency Address Database ( NEAD) , which 
they will use to track every Wi-Fi access point and Bluetooth beacon in the country. This is strictly for public 
safety use only. So when you, or a bystander that sees you collapsed on the floor, dial 911, the phone will 
check the ID of any local Wi-Fi access points and beacons against that database and use the information to 
get first responders to the right place. 
 Unfortunately, as many of us with  data plan overages can testify, Wi-Fi isn’t everywhere. Commercial 
Wi-Fi access points can be expensive ($1,300 or more), which somewhat limits their ubiquity. Fortunately, 
Bluetooth beacons run pretty cheap, $5-$40, and are being deployed in the millions, with ABI predicting 
over 400 million to be shipped by 2020. Lighting companies are even building them into the next generation 
of LED lighting. 
 Public safety could be a driver that accelerates the deployment of more beacons. Low-cost beacon 
modules could be deployed as a part of fire extinguishers, smoke alarms, and exit signs. Insurance 
companies may give building owners a break on their rates if they have beacons that are registered with 
NEAD. Meeting an obligation to do everything that is reasonably possible to avoid fatalities would reduce 
legal liability for emergencies occurring in inside buildings. Given the  low cost   of adding beacons to existing 
powered safety equipment, it’s not a stretch to imagine a mandate in building codes.  

CHAPTER 22 ■ THE FUTURE, STANDARDS, AND IP: PLEASE STOP KILLING US
381
 Standards Gap Prevents Beacon Use for e911 
 The team building the  NEAD database was working on adding Bluetooth beacons to the database, and then 
reality struck. The standards for beacons are such a mess that it’s not practical to use the majority of the 
beacons being deployed commercially for  e911 . 
 Not only are the iBeacon and Eddystone UID standards different, the bigger issue is that most beacons 
don’t use those standards. Companies investing in large-scale deployments want to control who gets to 
see their beacons. In order to do that, they are using proprietary, non-standard techniques to implement 
conditional access to their beacons. Apple’s (confidential!) iBeacon 1.0 specification, for example, which is 
over two years old, didn’t address this requirement, so almost every one of the hundreds of beacon OEMs 
claiming iBeacon compliance has created, in essence, its own “standard”. Google has launched Ephemeral 
IDs, but there will still be many competing proprietary standards and businesses that refuse to adopt a 
standard that registers the location of every beacon with Google. 
 As a member of the NEAD team says:
 The NEAD development team has not abandoned the concept of using BT beacons for E911 
location. Reality did strike—in that it became apparent that not all Bluetooth beacons can 
be relied upon for consistent ID/location use—but the plan is still to utilize those that can 
be relied upon (along with Wi-Fi Aps). Identifying a way for emergency services to access 
Bluetooth IDs would go a long way to resolving this issue. 
 What About the Bluetooth Beacon Standard? 
 Again, contrary to first glance and popular opinion, there is no Bluetooth beacon  standard  ; that Bluetooth 
Profile doesn’t exist (yet?!). Sure, there is a standard for the transport that beacons use for the broadcast of 
the advertising packets, but nothing in the standard actually mentions beacons. The high level addressing, 
configuration, and conditional access are all left to the manufacturer to make up as they see fit. 
 So who could help reconcile these hundreds of incompatible implementations? The Bluetooth SIG is 
ideally placed. Google and Apple are already fully paid up members, and Apple is even one of the seven 
top-level “Promoter” members, with keys to the executive washroom. Apple and Google together could 
make this happen. 
 Risk of Litigation 
 The patent attorneys have been busy. As the  startup community has created solutions to fill the gaps, they 
have been diligently applying for patents to cover these “innovations”. HP, Connect Quest, and Gimbal are 
three companies that have a lead in this area. Good for them. There isn’t a lot of money being made in the 
beacosystem today, but, once there is, expect a call. While this doesn’t appear to have stopped people so far, 
the threat of litigation is there, and is going to have a cooling effect on this beacon ecosystem that Apple and 
Google have curated. 
 What could be done to address this issue? If there were a Bluetooth beacon standard that covered these 
essential aspects, all the holders of IP would have to refrain from suing their fellow Bluetooth  Special Interest 
Group (SIG) members over aspects that are covered by the Bluetooth Standard, as they promised when they 
joined. If you use the standard, you have to join the SIG. This should give some comfort to large companies 
contemplating making big investments in deployments.  

CHAPTER 22 ■ THE FUTURE, STANDARDS, AND IP: PLEASE STOP KILLING US
382
 Don’t Standards Kill Profits? 
 Is the beacosystem really well served by having a hundred different ways of controlling who sees a beacon or 
how to set up its parameters? No! 
 Granted, this will increase the  commoditization of the lower parts of the beacon stack, but that’s 
happening anyway. Very few companies make money from beacon hardware. And, frankly, our ecosystem 
could do with fewer choices in terms of generic beacon hardware. The last thing we want is for companies 
thinking of deploying beacons to need to hire consultants like me to help them weed through the 200+ 
vendors of beacon hardware. Of course, I’m grateful for the business, but most sensible beacon vendors are 
focusing higher in the stack to add value and make profits. 
 Having 20, rather than 200, great beacon  hardware vendors competing on quality, battery life, and 
cost would help everyone else thinking of deploying this technology. The lower the cost and the better the 
quality, the more deployments are going to be made. 
 It’s the Network 
 e911 is not the only network that would benefit from real standards for “ephemeral IDs”— commercial 
networks would too. And the sooner those networks get joined up and take off, the better for almost 
everyone in the beacosystem. Having one app per beacon is like having an expensive boat anchor wrapped 
around the neck of your project. It slows everything down and adds capital and operational expense to 
deployments. 
 Deploying a beacon-enabled app should be as simple as going online, selecting the beacons you 
are interested in using, and clicking a button. Yet, while every beacon manufacturer has a different set of 
standards, it fragments the size of potential networks. 
 A “Lost” Opportunity for Maps 
 Both  Apple and Google Maps are now using beacons as a way of improving the accuracy of indoor 
navigation. Given most beacons are broadcasting ever-changing, proprietary UUID formats, these will be 
invisible to the maps apps. This is a “lost opportunity,” as those proprietary signals will just be seen as noise. 
A Bluetooth standard for conditional access beacon packets could support access being granted for maps, 
for e911, and any for other application that was deemed to be for the public’s benefit.  
 The Way Forward 
 If Apple and Google decided to unify the identification of beacons in a Bluetooth standard, would the 
beacon ecosystem adopt that standard? Yes, I think so. There would be a stampede. 
 Beacons would get better, the cost would come down further, e911 would get a lot more accurate a 
lot faster, and the pace of innovation, which admittedly isn’t slow, would reach another level—it would go 
ballistic. We all need these things. 
 Is it really worth delaying ambulances and hobbling this beautiful thing your companies have created 
by having conflicting standards with big gaps that open up the possibility of lawsuits? 

CHAPTER 22 ■ THE FUTURE, STANDARDS, AND IP: PLEASE STOP KILLING US
383
 As our NEAD insider says:
 The NEAD development effort is generating a ground swell of support from the FCC, 
wireless carriers, a great many public safety organizations, and other stakeholders. It does 
seem to present a golden opportunity to add a key and potentially life-saving use-case for 
Bluetooth beacons. 
 We want smartphone experiences that are context sensitive, that blend the digital with the physical. 
Let’s merge click-stream analytics with foot-stream analytics. Context-sensitive apps can become 
widespread with standards, and beacon networks can be built on those standards. 
 Bluetooth beacons are the tendons that join the muscle of the digital world with the bones of our 
physical world. Please heal the divisions with a standard we can all use to build better solutions. 
 Yours respectfully,  
 Steve Statler
