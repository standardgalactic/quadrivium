PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION 
 
Planning and design are key activities which, together with management and 
construction or production, allow any engineering project to be taken from the 
initial concept stage through to successful implementation. Each engineering 
project, whether in the traditional or the newer developing fields of engineering, 
relies for its success on the application of the basic processes of planning, design 
and management. Our prime aim in this book is to show how the processes of 
planning and design are carried out. 
 
However, the underlying purpose of the book is somewhat broader: to 
explain the nature of engineering and to describe the type of work engineers 
undertake. The book therefore deals with the problems engineers are called on to 
solve, and, most importantly, the common sense methodologies that are used to 
solve engineering problems. It also presents some quantitative tools that are useful 
in undertaking the work of engineering planning and design. 
 
The book has been written for students who are commencing their studies of 
engineering, and for lecturers who are presenting classes to students in the early 
semesters of an engineering degree course. It is also intended for non-specialist 
readers who seek information on the nature of engineering work and how it is 
carried out. Some of the more advanced material in the later chapters is suitable 
for presentation in the later years of an engineering degree program. 
 
The purpose of the book has not changed substantially from that of the first 
edition, which was published in 1989. That edition was co-authored by Graeme 
Dandy and Robert Warner. Since then, however, the need for introductory courses 
in undergraduate engineering programs has become more generally recognised by 
engineering academics. Courses that provide an introduction to engineering and 
to engineering planning and design are now an integral part of most engineering 
undergraduate programs.  
 
In the second edition (published in 2008) David Walker and Trevor Daniell 
were added as co-authors and the contents were extended, revised and updated 
extensively. In particular, the chapters on creativity, problem solving, and on 
social and environmental aspects were extensively rewritten and expanded and 
new chapters on project scheduling, management, communications, law and 
ethics and risk and reliability were added. In our treatment of management we 
deal with team work, team building, time management and the management of 
people. 
 
Following David Walkerâs retirement, he has been replaced as a co-author of 
this third edition by Bernadette Foley, who has been teaching engineering planning 
and design in our school. The other  co-authors  would like to  acknowledge  Davidâs  
significant contribution to this book. He revised the chapters on engineering and 
society, creativity, economic evaluation and engineering decision-making in the 
second edition as well as adding valuable interest boxes throughout the book. 
David also took responsibility for the formatting of the entire second edition. He 
has been kind enough to allow us to use his second edition material in the third 
edition.

Preface 
 
 
In the third edition, the material and references have been brought up-to-
date. It also expands significantly on the previous section on economic evaluation 
and includes a new section on intractable problems and systems including a 
discussion of wicked problems, soft systems methodology and the agile approach 
to software development. Furthermore, additional problems and interest boxes 
have been added. 
 
The text emphasises the fact that engineering is an essential part of the 
framework of our society, and is therefore closely linked with various social, 
political, legal and environmental questions and problems.  
 
Much of the material in the first and second editions has been included in 
the first-year syllabus of various engineering degree programs at the University of 
Adelaide for many years, as well as at other institutions worldwide. Some of the 
more advanced topics are presented in subsequent years of our civil and 
environmental engineering degree programs. The extensive rewriting we have 
undertaken for the third edition reflects our ongoing experience in teaching in this 
field as well as significant changes that have occurred in engineering itself in 
recent years.  
 
The majority of the examples presented in the book come from the field of 
civil and environmental engineering, which is the area of engineering expertise of 
the authors. Nevertheless, we believe that the ideas and content are generally 
applicable and relevant to all fields of engineering, and beyond.  
 
The material contained in this new edition can be used in various ways. We 
have divided the major portion of the book into two parts: the first ten chapters set 
out a conceptual framework for undertaking engineering projects, while Chapters 
11 to 13 provide a range of techniques and tools for solving the sorts of problems 
that commonly arise in engineering planning and design.  
 
The conceptual framework provided by Chapters 1â10 is designed to 
introduce engineering as a profession, to set out what engineering work involves 
and how it is undertaken, and to describe an approach to engineering problem-
solving that is both flexible and formal. We see all ten chapters as being 
important for any first year engineering course. At the University of Adelaide, 
material selected from these chapters is also applied in a first year design course 
for civil and environmental engineering students.  
 
The techniques and tools presented in Chapters 11â13 are designed to allow 
quantitative assessment of design and planning problems. These chapters contain 
material that is beyond what would normally be covered in a first year 
introductory course and is ideal for higher-level courses in an engineering degree 
program.

CHAPTER ONE  
Engineering and Society  
 
In this introductory chapter we discuss the nature, history, and scope of 
engineering work and the role of the engineer in society. In broad terms, engineers 
are responsible for designing, planning, constructing and maintaining the physical 
infrastructure that supports modern society and allows it to function effectively. 
Engineers make extensive use of scientific and mathematical knowledge, but their 
work is distinguished from the work of scientists and mathematicians by an 
emphasis on the use of all available relevant knowledge to solve real infrastructure 
problems as economically and efficiently as possible, in an environmentally and 
socially responsible way.  
1.1 MODERN SOCIETY AND ITS ENGINEERED INFRASTRUCTURE  
Modern society functions within the framework of a vast and complex engineered 
infrastructure that supports, and indeed makes possible, modern everyday life. For 
example, the large volumes of clean water that are used each day domestically, and 
by industry and agriculture, are supplied by a complex engineering system that is 
made up of remote rain catchment areas, reservoirs, pumping stations, pipelines, 
desalination plants, water treatment plants and local networks of reticulation pipes. 
The water supply system is one small part of the infrastructure. Another system 
generates and supplies the energy that is used to heat, cool and light the buildings 
that we live in, work in and relax in. Enormous amounts of additional energy are 
consumed by our factories and industries. Yet another part of the infrastructure 
enables communications over large distances and the sending and receiving of large 
quantities of information almost instantaneously. We use a transport system to move 
people and goods within and between our cities and urban regions and between 
countries. At home, at work and at leisure we have an array of low-cost 
manufactured goods available, including labour-saving devices, personal computers, 
smart phones and audio and TV devices that reduce our physical work load and 
entertain us. These are just a few examples of the component parts of the 
engineering infrastructure.  
 This engineering infrastructure is made up of large, separate, but interacting, 
parts, which we call âsystemsâ. Each system has been designed to satisfy a specific 
set of goals that are related to community needs, and consists of many interacting 
components, or sub-systems. The built environment is a part of the engineering 
infrastructure. It consists of the many buildings, large and small, that provide shelter 
for us and for our belongings, and safe venues for our day-to-day activities. These 

Engineering and Society

buildings dominate the visual landscape of our cities and urban regions. They 
include high-rise and low-rise apartment buildings, houses, office buildings, 
factories, hospitals, schools, sports stadia, entertainment complexes and shopping 
complexes. They have been created by engineers, working with architects and 
builders. Of course, not all the engineering infrastructure is highly visible like the 
built infrastructure; much of it is unseen.  
 Although the engineering infrastructure has been created to satisfy community 
and individual needs, its functioning is not well understood or appreciated by many 
of the people who use it. When we want clean, fresh water we simply turn on a tap. 
We do not think about the many components and processes that bring the water to 
us. Likewise, by pulling the plug in a basin or by pressing a button on a toilet cistern 
we remove unwanted waste water and effluent without thinking of the complex 
disposal system and its many components that have been carefully planned, 
designed and constructed. Other disposal systems remove, treat and recycle the 
rubbish, garbage and other solid wastes that we generate. The processes of removal 
of liquid and solid wastes, of their transport, treatment, recycling and disposal, are 
out of sight and out of mind for most people. Lack of concern with, or 
understanding of, such details is perhaps a positive sign, that our engineering 
infrastructure is operating successfully. 
 This infrastructure has been developed progressively over many generations to 
meet the ongoing and expanding needs and demands of society, but there is also a 
feedback effect at play. The characteristics of the existing infrastructure, and 
especially its strengths and weaknesses, affect the way society itself develops and 
changes over time. A simple example is the way urban expansion is affected by the 
existing transport system. The transport system in a city develops in response to the 
need of the community to move people and goods efficiently, but there is inevitably 
a significant time delay before needed improvements are made to the existing 
transport corridors, and before new corridors can be constructed. New urban 
development therefore tends to cluster around the most efficient and most capacious 
existing transport corridors. The cost and efficiency of vertical construction and 
transport (in the form of fast elevators), as compared with the cost of land and 
horizontal transport, also influence the degree to which high-rise development will 
occur as well as, or as an alternative to, the continued outwards urban development.  
 In the past, major new steps forward in science and technology have resulted 
in enhancements to the infrastructure of our society. Over the last fifty or so years, 
developments have been particularly rapid, due in large part to the development of 
computer and Internet technologies. This development will continue into the 
foreseeable future and it will be complemented by the replacement of older parts of 
the infrastructure by newer and more efficient ones, because of the development of 
new, disruptive technologies.  
 It is the role of engineers to plan, design and create the systems, and their 
components, that constitute our physical infrastructure. They also have the task of 
managing, maintaining and expanding this infrastructure in response to developing 
societal needs.  
 Of course, the engineering infrastructure does not always operate perfectly, 
but for most of the time it is effective, efficient and economical. It is only on rare 
occasions, when for example there is a temporary interruption to the supply of water 
or electricity, or when the Internet is âdownâ, or when there are longer term water 

Engineering and Society

restrictions, that most people reflect on the engineering infrastructure that makes our 
modern life possible.  
 Unfortunately, there are many countries and regions in the world that are 
without adequate engineering infrastructure. This is a challenge to engineers, but it 
is an equal or even greater challenge to politicians and civil servants. There are 
always technical and organisational problems for engineers to solve, but poor 
infrastructure within a region or city or nation is usually indicative of broader issues 
and problems that do not have engineering solutions. It is too often a sign that 
fundamental social and political problems must be addressed by the people and their 
political representatives.  
 
 
City growth and transport technology 
 
In the past there has been a progressive increase in the size and population of 
cities around the world, which has resulted from the development of new transport 
technologies.  
In ancient city states such as Athens, people relied on the muscle power of 
humans and animals for transport. Although heavy goods could be delivered using 
animal-drawn carriages, most citizens walked wherever they needed to go. The city 
size was thus limited by the ability of most people to walk to the various parts of 
their city, and home again, comfortably in a day. This limitation applied to ancient 
Rome, and to cities up to and beyond the middle ages.  
It was not until the 17th and 18th Centuries that mass transport began, initially 
by means of large horse-drawn vehicles. Cities such as London and Paris then 
increased rapidly in size and population. Before this, the size and layout of a city 
were governed by the need for workers to be within walking distance of their places 
of work (Richards, 1969; White, 1978). With the invention of the steam engine and 
then the advent of city and suburban railways in the 19th Century, large cities with a 
commuting workforce became possible.  
In the 20th Century, the internal combustion engine and the automobile, 
together with upgraded roads and freeways, allowed city conglomerates to develop 
with a very large population spread over an enormous urban area. The way of life 
in such cities is necessarily very different to that in a small traditional city, such as 
those still found in Europe. 
In a discussion of the relative merits of compact cities, Gordon and 
Richardson (1997) state that in 1890 the effective radius of US cities was 
approximately 2 miles (3.2 km). By 1920 it had grown to 8 miles (12.9 km) following 
the development of public transport. By 1950 the figure had risen to 11 miles (17.7 
km) with the widespread use of the automobile. By 1970, with the construction of 
urban freeways the average radius had increased to 20 to 24 miles (32.2 to 38.6 
km).  
1.2 HISTORICAL NOTE 
In this short note, we can only provide a superficial view of engineering in history. 
However, society and its engineering infrastructure have developed together in step, 
and are closely interwoven. One practical lesson from history is that engineering 
work must be based on an understanding of society and how it functions, and on a 
careful and impartial evaluation of the sometimes-conflicting demands that come 
from individuals and from the community.  

Engineering and Society  
 
4 
 
 The first significant engineering works were probably undertaken around 
10000 to 12000 years ago, when our human forebears started to live together in 
permanent settlements. This was a time of great change: humans were giving up the 
life of nomadic hunter-gatherers to adopt a more sedentary, agricultural-based way 
of life. The settlements needed basic infrastructure, such as permanent dwellings, 
all-weather pathways, and outer defensive walls to protect against wild animals and 
marauding humans. Archaeologists tell us that the agricultural revolution probably 
began in the river valleys of the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East, which includes 
parts of modern day Iraq, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, and Egypt.  
 This new communal way of life, based on agriculture and the domestication of 
animals, led to greater efficiency in the production of food, which in turn allowed 
the settlements to grow and to become more efficient. As the settlements grew, 
there was need for more complex infrastructure, for large, communal buildings and 
for permanent and reliable sources of water, both for domestic use and for 
agriculture. Archaeological evidence of early irrigation systems and large buildings 
abound in the Fertile Crescent. Ruins have been excavated in Turkey of 
monumental buildings that predate the Egyptian pyramids by millennia. Extensive 
engineering works were carried out by the Sumerians in present-day southern Iraq, 
in the period from the fifth to the second millennium BCE. According to Kramer 
(1963), the land they inhabited was âhot and dry, with soil that was arid and wind-
swept and unproductiveâ. But by 3000 BCE the Sumerians had turned the land ... 
âinto a veritable Garden of Eden and developed what was probably the first high 
civilization in the history of man". To transform their environment, they had to use 
both technological and organisational skills. As Kramer points out, âthe 
construction of an intricate system of canals, dykes, weirs, and reservoirs demanded 
â¦ engineering skill and knowledge. Surveys and plans had to be prepared which 
involved the use of levelling instruments, measuring rods, drawing, and mapping." 
The creation of such buildings and irrigation canals required both the organisational 
and technological skills that are basic to engineering work.  
 Continuing improvements in the agricultural economy allowed people in 
larger settlements to specialise in their work, and, with increased leisure time, to put 
more effort into handicrafts and art forms. However, these developments also led to 
an ever more complicated way of life, and to a stratification of society with 
inequalities that are still with us. With everyday life and work becoming more and 
more complicated, it was necessary to create and maintain permanent records, and 
so the first systems of writing were developed, using the mediums of stone, wax, 
papyrus and, somewhat later, paper.  
 There was an increasing demand for engineering works as permanent 
settlements expanded into cities, supported by surrounding agricultural regions, and 
then as the cities and regions came together to become countries. Of course, these 
developments were not restricted to the Middle East. By the beginning of the 
common era, a little over 2000 years ago, the results of the agricultural revolution 
were to be seen in many parts of Europe, Asia and the Middle East. Engineering 
works of great complexity and magnitude had already been undertaken in ancient 
Egypt, the Roman Empire, India and China. Comparable developments in the 
Americas came somewhat later, because of the later migration of peoples into that 
part of the world.

 The ever-increasing demands for an improved and expanded infrastructure led 
to increased efficiency and increased capacity in the irrigation systems for 
agriculture, the water supplies for cities, the roads for transport and for 
communication, and the walls and fortifications to protect cities against attack. In 
undertaking large, monumental engineering works, organisational skills were 
needed, as well as technological skills. As Rivers (2005) has pointed out, the Great 
Wall of China, which was started around the 6th or 7th Century BCE, âcould not 
have been constructed solely with the technology of cutting stone from quarries and 
then transporting those stones to the designated sites. Unless an elaborate 
organisation existed in Chinese society, the Great Wall would never have been built, 
then or now.â 
 
 
An ancient engineerâs life and its rewards 
 
Sprague de Camp (1963) gives an account of an engineer who made good in 
ancient Egypt, a land of rigid class lines not easily crossed. However, engineers 
succeeded in crossing them, since engineering ability was not a common gift. The 
builder-engineer-architect Nekhebu (from 24th Century BC) told on his tomb the 
story of his rise from humble beginnings: 
âHis Majesty found me a common builder; and His Majesty conferred upon me the 
offices of Inspector of Builders, then Overseer of Builders, and Superintendent of a 
Guild. And His Majesty conferred upon me the offices of Kingâs Architect and 
Builder, then Royal Architect and Builder under the Kingâs Supervision. And His 
Majesty conferred upon me the offices of Sole Companion, Kingâs Architect and 
Builder in the Two Houses.â 
Nekhebu also received other titles and was rewarded with gold, bread and beer.  
 
  
 Early engineering was usually either military or non-military in nature. The 
term âcivilianâ engineering was used to distinguish between the two fields, and is 
now referred to as civil engineering. Armed conflict makes up a large part of human 
history; it seems that it has always been with us. Skirmishes surely occurred 
between small competing groups of hunter-gatherers. This would have escalated to 
conflict between permanent settlements, and out-and-out warfare between city 
states, and then between countries and even civilisations.  
 Two important aspects of military engineering are defence and attack. The 
engineering works used in the defence of ancient cities included high outer walls 
and fortifications, and large underground cisterns within the city to store water. To 
attack and besiege a city, military engineers could attempt to undermine the outer 
walls and fortifications, and use mechanical catapults to bombard the walls and the 
interior of the city with large rocks. Movable towered structures with protective 
armour assisted in the breaching of walls. Catapults and cranes were used by the 
defenders to bombard the attacking army and to drop rocks and burning oil on those 
attempting to scale the walls. There were also non-engineering options for the 
besieging army: to attempt to poison the water supply and to cut off the supply lines 
to the city that brought food and other essential goods.

Early American civilisations and their engineering infrastructure 
 
When Juan de Grijalva set sail from Havana on April 8, 1518, he was in search of 
an ancient civilisation, one that Spanish sailors had discovered quite by accident 
the previous year. Three sailing ships, blown off course by a severe storm, had 
happened upon ancient ruins of a splendid city. There, according to Gallenkamp 
(1960) âan astonishing sight was visible in the distance: rising up as though an 
outgrowth of the native limestone were a high wall enclosing a series of terraced 
pyramids and palace-like buildings constructed of carefully fitted stonesâ. 
The constructions were more than just the work of skilled stonemasons: they 
showed a high level of planning, design and organization, and the Spaniards were 
convinced they had found a lost civilisation. This assessment came well before they 
saw any of its population, before they had studied its language, its art, and its legal 
and political systems. The evidence of technological expertise, engineering skill 
and organisation on a significant scale was all that was required.  
The Maya civilisation was not unique. There were also the Incas in South 
America and the Aztecs in central and southern Mexico. In each case an advanced 
civilisation could be recognised by the architecture and engineering infrastructure. 
On further study, the characteristics of each civilisation were uncovered. 
Sometimes there were surprises: the Incas had no written language, nor had they 
developed the wheel, yet the fact that they had achieved a state of civilisation was 
beyond question on the basis of their engineering prowess alone.

 Archaeological evidence indicates that mechanical, mining and chemical 
engineering works were also undertaken in the distant past, when humans started to 
live together in settlements. Around 9800 BCE, gypsum plaster was produced in 

Engineering and Society  
 
7 
 
Mesopotamia by heating gypsum in wood-fired kilns. This material is also known 
as âplaster of Parisâ because there was a large deposit of gypsum in Montmartre in 
Paris, France. 
In the time between 8000 and 7000 BCE, people inhabiting what 
is now modern day Turkey mined copper ore. They beat it into beads, hooks and 
metal sheets. Somewhat earlier, the people of Mesopotamia had formed copper 
plates into small tubes as a form of jewellery (Mithen, 2003). 
 Later in ancient Rome, multi-storey apartment buildings up to six stories high 
were constructed in the cheap parts of town to house the ordinary people, the 
plebeians. As the building work was often shoddy, special building ordinances were 
created to try to improve the quality of construction.  
 Water was supplied to the city of Rome (though not to individual apartment 
buildings) by aqueducts. These traversed the plains, and, where necessary, linked up 
with tunnels that were dug through the hills. Of the 11 aqueducts for the city of 
Rome, one was over 100 km in length. In the city, water was reticulated by means 
of pipes made of clay and lead. Although engineering has been attributed with 
improving the health of populations by the provision of clean potable (drinkable) 
water, it has been speculated that the use of lead water pipes may have been 
responsible for lead poisoning among the population of Rome before its fall in the 
5th Century CE.  
 Spectacular multi-level stone Roman aqueducts still survive in various places 
in Europe, such as Segovia in Spain, and NÃ®mes in France (Figure 1.2).

southern France (Â© R F Warner). 
 
 Engineering in the ancient world was based on experience and empirical rules. 
According to Straub (1952) âDespite the remarkable scientific standard, especially 
of the Greeks in the spheres of mechanics and statics, there was hardly any 
connection between theory and practice, and hardly any attempt to apply the 
scientific knowledge to practical purposes, in the sense of modern engineering.â 
Engineering was practised as a craft, with reliance on common sense and time-
honoured experience rather than on the application of scientific principles. 

Engineering and Society

Nevertheless, the Romans used arches and domes to construct beautiful and almost 
ever-lasting buildings and bridges.  
 With the development of scientific knowledge during the Renaissance, the 
usefulness of scientific principles was increasingly recognised, and science and 
mathematics became important in the education of engineers. In the last decade of 
the 16th Century, Galileo Galilei began teaching mechanics, geometry and 
astronomy at the University of Padua. In his 18 years there, he published important 
works on the motion of falling objects and on hydrostatics. In his book âDialogues 
concerning two new sciencesâ, he investigated the foundations of statics and 
dynamics. This is regarded by some scholars as the birth of engineering science. 
 In France, a formal school for military engineers was established in 1675. 
Members of the Corps du GÃ©nie were instructed by military engineers of the calibre 
of Vauban, whose star-shaped designs for defensive fortifications were known and 
used throughout Europe. This school was so successful that a French civil corps was 
formed in 1716, the Corps des IngÃ©nieurs des Ponts et ChaussÃ©es. The Ãcole des 
Ponts et ChaussÃ©es was created in 1747 to train civil engineers. This school was 
unique at the time because mathematics, geometry, mechanics (statics) and testing 
were considered to be the basis for engineering works of all kinds. According to 
Kirby et al. (1990), the rapid development of this style of formal training came 
about when it was found that designs based on scientific principles were more 
economical than those based purely on experience.  
 Initially, the French emphasis on using scientific knowledge and 
experimentation was not followed universally. In England in the 18th century, 
engineering was still regarded as an art which was learnt by working as an 
apprentice with a master. Among the successful, and indeed excellent, British 
engineers there tended to be a mistrust of mathematics, and theory was thought to 
be of little value to the practitioner. Thomas Telford, one of the most innovative and 
successful engineers of this time, made distinguished contributions to the design of 
aqueducts, cast-iron bridges, harbours, canals and earthworks, using, in his own 
words, âno theoryâ.  
The first technical university was established in Paris in 1794, to deal with a 
dearth of engineers and administrators in France as a consequence of the 
revolution. It was originally called the âÃcole Centrale des Travaux Publicsâ, but 
in 1795 became the âÃcole Polytechniqueâ. This set a pattern in Europe, with the 
establishment of polytechnics and technical universities in ZÃ¼rich, Delft, and then 
in many other cities. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology was the first 
technological institute to be set up in North America. It was founded in 1861. In 
Scotland, and then in England, engineering was introduced as a discipline in the 
traditional universities. At Cambridge University, for example, the present 
Engineering Department was established in 1875. 
 The English word engineer, together with its equivalent in other European 
languages, seems to date from the 17th Century and to come from the much earlier 
Latin word ingenium, which was a type of Roman siege engine. In France and in 
Britain the term âcivil engineeringâ was used in the 18th Ccentury to refer to non-
military, or civilian engineering. John Smeaton is thought to be the first person to 
refer to himself as a âcivil engineerâ. 
 In the late 18th Century, engineers began to establish professional societies. A 
group in England, including John Smeaton, formed a society of engineers in 1771. 

Engineering and Society  
 
9 
 
In 1828 that society became the Institution of Civil Engineers, which functions to 
this day. Their definition of engineering at that time highlighted the skills used, and 
emphasised working for the benefit of humanity: Engineering isâ¦ âthe art of 
directing the great forces of power in nature for the use and convenience of man, as 
the means of production and of traffic in states, both for external and internal trade 
as applied in the construction of roads, bridges, aqueducts, canals, river navigation, 
and docks for international intercourse and exchange, and in the construction of 
ports, harbours, moles, breakwaters, and light-houses, â¦ navigation by artificial 
power â¦ construction and application of machinery, and in the drainage of cities 
and townsâ. 
 The focus of this definition was on civil engineering, and the activities listed 
were accordingly restricted. Specialisation within the ranks of non-military 
engineers began in the early 19th Century, following the development of steam 
power for factories and locomotion. This led to the formation in various countries of 
separate societies for mechanical, mining, electrical and chemical engineers. Further 
separation from these traditional societies occurred in the 20th Century whenever 
specialisation had increased to a level where it was appropriate to differentiate 
among the members and their skills. Specialisation within engineering has 
continued and indeed accelerated into the 21st Century. 
 An updated and more general definition of the overall field of engineering was 
made in 1958 by the US Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology: 
Engineering is ... âthe profession in which a knowledge of the mathematical and 
natural sciences, gained by study, experience, and practice, is applied with judgment 
to develop ways to utilize, economically, the materials and forces of nature for the 
benefit of mankindâ. 
 In this statement (quoted in Voland, 2004) the list of specific design skills has 
been removed and the theme of working for the benefit of mankind has been 
introduced. The idea of working economically has also been included. In fact, 
concepts of cost control and economic operation began to be used overtly in 
engineering work in the late 19th Century. These are important considerations in all 
modern engineering work, although when new, innovative techniques are being 
developed and used for the first time, the main problem may be to get the project 
completed successfully. A distinguished engineer has ruefully suggested that it is 
often better, financially, to be the second or third person to use a new, innovative 
process.  
 In the middle of the 20th Century there were still five main engineering 
branches: civil, electrical, mechanical, chemical and mining engineering, but, 
following the Second World War, development was rapid in all fields of 
engineering and many new branches of specialisation appeared, and matured. 
Subdivisions of the traditional fields, and the appearance of completely new 
engineering disciplines, have continued to this day. The newer engineering branches 
flourishing towards the end of the 20th Century included aeronautical, aerospace, 
agricultural, automotive, biomedical, coastal, computer systems, electronic, 
environmental, mechatronic, medical, optical, rehabilitation, and transport 
engineering, to name but a few. The pace of engineering innovation and 
development has if anything accelerated into the 21st Century, especially with the 
impetus from electronics, computer technology and information technology. Walesh 
(2012) has pointed out that 27 different types of undergraduate engineering 

Engineering and Society

programs were recognised in 2011 for the purpose of course accreditation in the 
United States by the organisation ABET (2011). With the relatively recent 
introduction of the Internet and with new developments in artificial intelligence, we 
can expect to see a rash of new innovative engineering applications in many fields 
in the near future. 
1.3 THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF ENGINEERING WORK  
Although engineering work is becoming increasingly more diverse and more 
specialised, some characteristics are common, and this allows us to identify the 
basic nature of engineering work. A common characteristic is the need for 
engineering work to be undertaken in minimum time, and using limited resources 
such as people, energy, materials and money. For this reason, modern engineering 
work is undertaken as individual projects, with clearly specified goals. Another 
characteristic is the use of scientific knowledge, technology and mathematics. 
Activities that are common to the different fields and branches of engineering 
include planning and design, modelling and analysis, implementation, research and 
development, organizing and managing, and the sale and marketing of engineering 
products and services. These activities are an indication of the nature and scope of 
engineering work in the early 21st Century. By discussing them, we can highlight 
the common aspects of engineering work. 
Engineering projects 
As we have seen, engineers have the responsibility of developing, maintaining, 
and extending the physical infrastructure, and thereby improving the conditions of 
life in the community. However, with limited resources on the one hand, and 
unlimited needs and demands of the community on the other hand, efficiency is a 
prime requirement, so that engineering projects need to be carried out with the 
minimum use of scarce resources, in limited time, and with clearly stated goals and 
definite starting and finishing states.  
 The goal of an engineering project may be to create a physical object, that is to 
say, a piece of hardware, that will be a component in a physical system. For 
example, the object could be a new clutch system for a car, an entirely new electric 
car, or a network of reticulation pipes for water supply in a new city suburb.  
However, the goal might not be to create a physical object at all, but instead to 
create a list of steps that will define a factory process. It might be to determine a set 
of instructions, or a list of actions, that, when undertaken, will achieve a goal. For 
example, a protocol for the release of water from a group of dams in times of very 
heavy rainfall might be created with the purpose of alleviating flooding in a river 
valley. The term plan is commonly used to refer to such protocols and lists, and we 
will use this term in this sense. A computer program might also be regarded as a 
plan. The word artefact has been used in engineering texts as a general term that 
includes both physical objects and plans.  
Some examples of engineering projects are: the design and construction of an 
overpass bridge (a physical object); the design, construction and operation of a 
chemical plant to produce fertilizer (a physical object and a plan); the adaptation 
and programming of a microprocessor to operate a programmed washing machine 

Engineering and Society  
 
11 
 
(a plan); and the widening and strengthening of a bridge to allow increased traffic in 
the future (both a plan and an object).  
A considerable part of modern engineering work is concerned with the 
maintenance and upkeep of existing facilities. Although para-professional staff may 
well undertake maintenance work on a routine basis, a substantial plan is usually 
needed for the maintenance and repair of the major items of infrastructure. The term 
asset management is applied to such activities, and it is an important engineering 
activity.  
Planning and design 
Planning and design are activities in which the details of an engineering system or a 
process are worked out to the extent necessary for implementation to be undertaken. 
For example, before work can start on the construction of a building, a structural 
design must be carried out, and then the building processes have to be carefully 
planned. The mechanical, electrical, communications and other services also have to 
be planned and designed. The planning and design phases of an engineering project 
are crucially important, and usually lengthy and time-consuming. 
The terms planning and design are not mutually exclusive and there is no 
consistency in the technical usage of these words. It could well be argued that a 
design is a type of plan. Certainly in structural engineering, the results of a design 
are presented as a set of working drawings, or âplansâ. Nevertheless, it is useful to 
distinguish between planning and design, and the matter of terminology will be 
taken up again in Chapter 3. 
 Planning and design form crucial parts of any engineering project, irrespective 
of the engineering fields which may be involved. The quality of the planning and 
design work will have a decisive effect on the success of the project. Planning and 
design are also complex activities, so complex that they can usually only be carried 
out in an iterative manner, with much trial and error. A large part of this book is 
devoted to explaining how the basic engineering activities of planning and design 
are undertaken. 
Implementation 
The implementation phase of an engineering project usually commences when the 
planning and design phases are coming to a close. Implementation will be the most 
costly phase of projects that are aimed at creating physical objects, such as a 
building, a chemical plant or an automobile, where extensive use must be made of 
both physical and human resources. There are various specialised branches of 
engineering that relate to the implementation phase, such as industrial engineering, 
manufacturing engineering, construction engineering and supply chain engineering. 
Much detailed engineering knowledge and many specialised techniques have 
accumulated, and are dealt with in undergraduate courses and relevant textbooks. 
The situation can be different when the aim of the project is to produce a plan. 
The implementation phase might then become less costly. For example, 
implementation of a simple plan for the release of water from a dam at times of 
heavy rainfall, to prevent flooding but to maintain sufficient water for consumption, 
might require little more than the production of a manual and short instruction 
sessions for relevant technicians and operators. However, a water-release plan is not 

Engineering and Society  
 
12 
 
always simple. In complex situations continuing engineering input and judgement 
may be required, and the implementation phase could then become costly. The 
development of the plan, with systems to measure and control the quantities of 
released water and water levels, and evaluations to produce feedback information, 
could also be a major part of the cost. 
Engineering management 
The planning, design and implementation of a typical engineering project involves 
intense human effort and the use of scarce resources. Careful management of the 
entire project is needed. Management involves organising and co-ordinating the 
efforts of the people and the controlled use of physical processes in all phases of the 
project, so that a successful outcome is achieved within a limited budget. In this 
sense, management is a planning process.  
Co-ordination of people is a vital part of engineering management. Many 
specialists with highly focussed skills can be involved and so there is always the 
need for teamwork. It is common nowadays for special project managers to be 
appointed for the overall management of engineering work. If one looks at the 
billboard outside a major construction site, the name of the project manager is listed 
prominently, followed by the names of specialists, including architects, structural 
engineers, constructors, mechanical services providers, electrical services providers 
and so on.  
As the scale and complexity of a project increase, so too does the management 
effort that is required. A small project such as the design and installation of a 
roundabout in an existing streetscape might require a team of 4 or 5 professionals, 
in addition to the construction workers. The team would include a project 
supervisor, design engineer, a draftsperson and administrative support. By the time 
the project size is measured in multiple millions of dollars, the team is likely to be 
interdisciplinary, with 10 to 12 people, including additional engineers with 
specialised knowledge, and an increase in management and support staff. 
Engineering project management is an important field separate to, but closely linked 
with, planning and design.  
Management of an engineering project is a broad and important field that we 
cannot attempt to deal with in this book. However, management of the design and 
planning phase is itself an important task and will be discussed further in Chapters 3 
and 5, while various aspects of team work will be outlined in Chapter 6. 
Engineering analysis, modelling and testing 
In the design phase of an engineering project, it is necessary to predict how physical 
objects, not yet created, will behave under normal and extreme environmental and 
operational conditions. Analysis, modelling and physical testing are used for this 
purpose. In the modelling phase, the aim is to create an analytic model, which is a 
simplified conceptual representation of the object or process that takes account of 
the essentials and ignores the inessentials. The behaviour of the model can then be 
analysed theoretically to predict behaviour under a range of realistic conditions. 
Engineering analysis can involve a variety of disciplines, such as solid mechanics, 
fluid mechanics, soil mechanics, electronics, chemical processes, and informatics.  

Engineering and Society  
 
13 
 
 For example, in the design of an aircraft frame, including the wings and 
fuselage and tail-plane, computer-based theoretical analyses will be undertaken, 
using the principles of solid mechanics, to evaluate the stresses and strains that will 
occur in critical regions of the proposed structure at various stages of operation, 
such as take-off and landing, and under extreme turbulent conditions. The results of 
such analyses can then be used to judge the adequacy of competing alternative 
designs in regard to strength under extreme loads, deformations under normal 
working conditions, and other problems that can develop over time, such as fatigue.  
 
 
Biomedical engineering and bionic ears (Cochlear implants) 
 
Biomedical engineering has assisted many millions of people, either disabled 
through injury or with serious birth defects, to lead a normal life with the aid of 
special prostheses. Biomedical engineering began in the mid 20th Century as an 
interdisciplinary field in which engineers, medical scientists and medical 
practitioners worked co-operatively. There are many types of prostheses in use 
today, including computer-controlled artificial limbs, computer-generated speech 
devices, replacement joints for hips, knees and shoulders, and pacemakers that 
control heart functions, to name just a few. Biomedical engineers also create 
devices that are used in the diagnosis and monitoring of sick people, and in various 
forms of therapy. 
A cochlear implant is a biomedical device that was designed to improve the 
hearing of people with damaged inner ears or who have been born profoundly deaf. 
While hearing aids make sounds louder, cochlear implants take over the functions 
of the inner ear (the cochlea) and enable sound signals to be sent to the brain. The 
device consists of an external microphone and electronic circuit, usually fixed 
behind the ear, and small electrodes that are implanted in the cochlea and wired to 
the external circuit. The electrodes accept impulses from the microphone-circuit 
and then stimulate the cochlear nerve. The invention of this device is attributed to 
David Clark in 1978, when he was working at the University of Melbourne.  
In a recent article in the Melbourne Age (Saturday, 28th May, 2016) he 
explained how he had been inspired by a walk on the beach: âI saw a large 
seashell which had the same spiral shape as the cochlea, or inner ear. I had been 
trying to work out in the lab how wires might reach the regions of the cochlea to 
transmit the speech frequencies. That day I picked up the shell and threaded a long 
blade of grass around the shell, and then I realised I was onto something.â 
David Clark was a medical graduate. His PhD led to the cochlear implant. He 
set up the Department of Otolaryngology at the University of Melbourne. He is 
currently an Honorary Professor of Electrical Engineering and Distinguished 
Researcher at NICTA, which is Australiaâs Information and Communications 
Technology Research Centre in Excellence. 
Although over a million people have used the cochlear implant, the device has 
stirred controversy. Objections to its use have come from some members of the 
deaf community. For pre-lingual deaf people, sign language is the primary means 
of communication, and some have considered the cochlear implant to be a threat to 
this culture.  
 
 
While computer-assisted modelling and analysis can nowadays be applied 
successfully to quite complex physical objects, some are too complex to be 
modelled accurately using present day computing facilities. The testing of a 

Engineering and Society  
 
14 
 
physical model is an alternative approach. Wind-tunnel testing of model airframes 
remains an important step in the design of aircraft, owing to the complexities of 
representing and analysing turbulent flow. In coastal engineering, when the 
performance of a geometrically complex harbour with breakwaters and jetties is to 
be investigated under extreme weather conditions, the analyses may have to be 
supplemented, or possibly even replaced, by experimentation. If it is an existing 
system, it might be possible to undertake experiments and measurements under field 
conditions to supplement the theoretical analysis. In the design of very complex, 
yet-to-be-created objects, theoretical analysis may not be feasible. Physical 
laboratory models could then be used. In such cases, the model is itself a physical 
entity and it can be smaller or larger than the proposed prototype. 
Research and development 
Traditionally, basic scientific research is carried out to obtain new knowledge about 
the world we live in, for its own sake. Engineering research is more goal-directed, 
and is undertaken to provide new, useful information and knowledge in a specific 
field. This information may be needed for the development of new processes or for 
the design of new physical systems. The range of fields for engineering research 
and development is as wide as the fields of engineering. Engineering research may 
require the testing of new materials and components and the development of new 
techniques for the analysis and modelling of systems. 
In large engineering projects, it is often necessary to undertake directed 
research, with clearly specified goals, to obtain or confirm important design 
information that is not otherwise available.  
The value of, and need for, engineering research and development is well 
recognised, and considerable effort goes into this. In fact, the most rapidly 
developing technologies tend to be those where most money is being invested in 
research and development, although which is cause and which is effect is not always 
clear. 
Sales and marketing 
Planning and design, implementation, management and research and development 
are in the mainstream of engineering work, but there are many other tasks that must 
be carried out to ensure the success of an engineering project. Clearly, sales and 
marketing are vitally important in the introduction of new consumer goods, such as 
a new model of an automobile, a new piece of software, or even a new aircraft. 
Good engineering knowledge is highly desirable, and sometimes indispensable, for 
the successful sales and marketing of engineering projects, especially projects 
which aim to produce products that will be manufactured or created in large 
numbers.  
1.4 DEALING WITH COMPLEXITY 
One of the characteristics of our modern engineered infrastructure is its complexity. 
To appreciate this, it is only necessary to examine a typical piece of the physical 
infrastructure, say a road system that allows traffic to flow into, out of, and around a 

Engineering and Society  
 
15 
 
modern city. Such a road system includes hundreds of kilometres of multi-lane 
access highways and even more kilometres of smaller urban and suburban roads and 
streets. The access highways will include one or more circumferential ring roads 
that allow traffic to bypass the city, as well as the radial roads that bring the traffic 
into and out of the central grid of local roads and streets. Grade separation with 
cross-overs and fly-overs will be used where the main access roads intersect the ring 
roads, to allow the traffic to flow smoothly. Many bridges, embankments and 
retaining walls will be needed to provide the grade separations and to traverse 
geographic obstacles such as rivers. In the smaller streets and roads within the city, 
intersections will be at grade but with traffic lights or roundabouts to control and 
improve the flow. A vitally important component of the road system manages and 
controls traffic flow. This is in itself a complex system, made up of traffic sensors at 
key locations to measure traffic volumes, a sophisticated computerised plan with 
programs and computing facilities to optimise the traffic flows, and control devices, 
including lights and warning signs, that communicate instructions and information 
to drivers.  
The complexity of such a system makes it physically impossible for any one 
individual to keep all the details in mind, let alone to follow the detailed functioning 
of each component from second to second in time. Furthermore, it would be 
physically impossible for a single engineer working alone to plan and design 
additions to such a system and then supervise their construction in a reasonable 
amount of time. Nevertheless, some pieces of engineering infrastructure must be 
created economically and in a short time span. When installed, they must operate 
safely, efficiently, and near faultlessly. 
To deal with such complexity, engineers use a systems approach, which, in 
effect, is a process of analytic decomposition, whereby each complex entity is 
progressively broken down into simpler components and then sub-components until 
a stage is reached where it is possible to analyse how each individual part operates 
and how these simple parts interact with each other. In this way, it is possible to 
evaluate how the overall system will perform in its various modes of operation. This 
decomposition approach will be discussed in some detail in Chapter 2, where some 
basic systems concepts will be introduced to formalise the approach. 
1.5 ENGINEERING PROBLEM SOLVING  
Analytic problems and open-ended problems 
In the course of an engineering project, various types of problems arise that have to 
be dealt with in different ways. In particular it is important to distinguish between 
analytic problems and open-ended problems. 
As the name suggests, an analytic problem is solved by analysis and logical 
deduction. These problems occur typically in the detailed stages of design. In 
structural engineering, for example, in the detailed design of an office building, the 
deflections that occur in the reinforced-concrete slab floors under normal working 
conditions must be checked to ensure that they are not excessive. The details of the 
slabs will have been chosen in an earlier step in the design process. As in other 
analytic problems, the deflection that occurs is a single real value, and an estimate 
of it will be obtained by modelling, analysis, and detailed computation. Methods of 

Engineering and Society  
 
16 
 
modelling and analysis in the different engineering disciplines are dealt with in 
detail in undergraduate and graduate course programs in universities.  
Open-ended problems do not have a unique solution and they do not lend 
themselves to the analytic approach. It is possible to find a range of alternative, 
acceptable solutions to an open-ended problem. To provide a simple example, we 
will continue the discussion of the design of a floor system for an office building. At 
an earlier stage in the design process, before analytic problems concerning 
deflections and strengths are studied, a choice must be made of the type of floor 
system to be used. The problem here is to choose, on the basis of cost and 
performance, from a wide range of possible floor systems, such as flat plates, flat 
slabs, ribbed slabs in reinforced concrete or pre-stressed concrete, or concrete slabs 
supported on a grid of steel beams, or indeed a completely new innovative flooring 
system that will better suit the specific building project. An evaluation and costing 
of the main alternatives will produce a reasonable and acceptable solution, if not the 
best one.  
Another example of an open-ended problem arises from the traffic congestion 
that occurs at peak travel times in many cities and urban regions. Various solutions 
are possible, some being obvious, such as improving the public transport system or 
the road system, but some are less obvious, such as staggering office hours and 
extending opening times for shopping complexes. A mix of solutions might also be 
appropriate. The point here is that alternative solutions are not always obvious, nor 
always easy to evaluate. 
It is not always possible or desirable to look back to previous work to discover 
the alternative approaches that can be taken to solving an open-ended problem. 
When a large, new engineering project is commenced, and roughly similar projects 
have been successfully completed in the past, it can even be counter-productive to 
rely on information from past practice. If there are unique features in the new work, 
past solutions might be unhelpful and even misleading. Over-reliance on past 
practice restricts the innovative thinking that is needed to discover new and 
innovative solutions. In Chapter 3 we will take up the topic of dealing with open-
ended problems. Techniques are described there that are useful for solving open-
ended problems.  
Convergent and divergent thinking 
Analytic problems and open-ended problems are quite different in nature and 
different modes of thinking are needed to deal with them. These are sometimes 
referred to as convergent thinking and divergent thinking. In engineering work, 
engineers have to be adept in applying the convergent, problem-narrowing approach 
when they undertake modelling and analysis to solve an analytic problem, and also 
the divergent, problem-widening approach when confronted with open-ended 
problems.  
Most engineers and engineering students have been exposed (sometimes over-
exposed) to convergent ways of thinking. In undergraduate engineering degree 
programs, emphasis is placed on science and mathematics, and on analysis and 
logical argument. Engineering students therefore tend to find analytic problems 
easier to deal with than open-ended problems. The decomposition approach that 
engineers use to deal with complex systems and problems is based on a convergent 

Engineering and Society  
 
17 
 
way of thinking, as discussed in Chapter 2 of this book. Techniques that enhance 
divergent thinking, and that can be applied to open-ended engineering problems are 
considered in some detail in Chapter 3.  
Ill-defined problems 
Many engineering problems, both analytic and open-ended, are ill-defined when 
they first arise. This can be because new and emerging community problems and 
needs are discussed in vague terms by individuals and groups in the community. 
Sometimes, however, engineering problems are stated in overly specific terms, so 
that a solution to the problem is stated unintentionally in the formulation. For 
example, a new bridge in a specific location may initially be seen by the community 
as an obvious need to alleviate traffic problems. This might be correct, but 
alternatives, such as a tunnel, or other locations for the bridge, will deserve 
consideration and may, upon investigation, prove to be a superior solution. An 
overly specific problem statement is in fact an ill-defined statement. One of the first 
steps to be taken in engineering work is to identify the real problem that is to be 
solved, as distinct from community perceptions and the views and statements of 
individuals. An early step in an engineering project is to identify the real needs of 
the community that are to be satisfied. In this regard, engineers cannot purely be 
problem-solvers; they must also act as problem-framers (Donnelly and Boyle, 
2006). They must apply their skills and experience to recast the initial problem 
statements to ensure that sensible, if not optimal, outcomes are achieved. Problem 
definition is discussed in some detail in Chapter 3. 
1.6 ENGINEERING, SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS 
Engineers are not scientists, nor are they mathematicians. There are important 
features that distinguish the work of engineers from that of scientists and 
mathematicians. The engineer has an active role to play in using resources to satisfy 
community needs. Scientists are more concerned with understanding and modelling 
the physical and biological world, and are primarily engaged in acquiring 
knowledge, rather than using it. The active work of the engineer is also distinct from 
that of the mathematician, who is concerned with logical structures which may or 
may not be observable in the physical world.  
Engineers routinely make use of scientific principles, scientific knowledge and 
mathematics in their work, so that an engineering project can be carried out 
efficiently, and in limited time. But they make use of all available relevant 
knowledge, including that provided by science, mathematics and current 
technology, and also from fields such as economics and psychology. Nevertheless, 
the available knowledge is not always sufficient, and may then be supplemented by 
goal-directed engineering research and development work. This may require the 
development of new methods of analysis and modelling, laboratory and field 
experiments, or even a search through the literature to learn from past experience. 
While the prime engineering concern is with achieving community goals, and 
not with the discovery of new scientific or mathematical knowledge as such, good 
engineering work can lead to new scientific, mathematical and engineering 
knowledge and new technologies. The boundaries between science, mathematics 

Engineering and Society  
 
18 
 
and engineering are not rigid. From time to time, engineering problems will arise 
that require input from scientists, mathematicians and other professionals. A 
common program of work will then result, with engineers working together with 
sother professionals.  
Cutting-edge engineering work can lead to the development of new 
mathematical procedures and scientific knowledge. In the mid-20th Century, for 
example, approximate methods of structural analysis were developed by engineers. 
They became known as ârelaxation methodsâ, and allowed approximate, but 
accurate, numerical results to be obtained for the analysis of complex structural 
systems, including airframes. The methods became widely used in fields where 
closed-form mathematical analysis was not possible.  
 
1.7 ENGINEERING IN THE 21ST CENTURY 
The National Academy of Engineering of the United States (2006) published 
the following list of the 20 greatest engineering achievements of the 20th Century:  
 
ï· Electrification 
ï· Automobile 
ï· Aeroplane  
ï· Water Supply and Distribution 
ï· Electronics 
ï· Radio and TV 
ï· Agricultural Mechanization 
ï· Computers 
ï· Telephone 
ï· High performance materials 
ï· Highways 
ï· Spacecraft 
ï· Internet 
ï· Imaging 
ï· Household Appliances 
ï· Health Technology 
ï· Nuclear Technologies 
ï· Laser and Fibre Optics 
ï· Petroleum 
and 
Petrochemical 
Technology 
ï· Air Conditioning and Refrigeration 
  
Such a choice is of course subjective, and there are many other competing 
engineering developments from the previous century that have greatly improved the 
quality of life that much of our planet enjoys. Such a list presents a challenge to 
current and future engineers: to match the contributions of our predecessors. They 
also invite the question: what will be the important engineering developments in the 
coming decades? An article in Technology Review (2005), designed to give readers 
a sample of things to come, listed the following 10 emerging technologies: 
 
 
ï· Airborne networks 
ï· Universal memory 
ï· Quantum wires 
ï· Bacterial factories 
ï· Silicon photonics 
ï· Enviromatics 
ï· Metabolomics 
ï· Cell phone viruses 
ï· Magnetic-resonance-force 
microscopy 
ï· Bio-mechatronics

Although some of these might not be successful, they do suggest developments 
we can expect to see in the near future. Expansion at the frontiers of engineering 
will surely be rapid, and in ways that were science fiction only a few decades ago. 
Some current trends and problems, and some likely future developments are now 
discussed. 
Continuing problems of sustainability and climate change  
The world population was already around 8 billion people in 2016 and has 
continued to increase. Humans are now so numerous that they affect the earth and 
its ecosystems in many ways. Local effects in regions of high density are obvious 
and have been measurable for many years.  
 When Svante Arrhenius first suggested in 1896 that carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere might cause global warming, he was thinking of natural sources of the 
gas. Continuing climate change due to natural (non-man-made) effects has of course 
been going on ever since a crust formed on the earth, and Arrhenius did not believe 
that man-made releases could have any effect, given the very small amounts 
involved at the time (Bengtsson, 1994).  
 But now, more than a hundred years later, the situation is different. The 
consensus of the scientific community is that humans have the potential to make an 
impact on the climate of the whole earth and may have already started to do so. The 
phenomenon has been referred to as climate change or global warming. Some 
scientists consider that man-induced climate changes are occurring, with 
significantly higher, and possibly lower, temperatures in different parts of the earth.  
There is ample evidence of change, irrespective of causes. In agricultural and 
other climate-dependesnt industries, it has become necessary to adapt to climate 
change. Grape-growers and wine-makers around the world, from the Barossa Valley 
in South Australia to the Rhine Valley in Germany, have had to change their harvest 
times, production procedures, and even grape varieties, in response to increasing 
temperatures (Daniell et al. 2017). In the United Kingdom, wine-making has 
become (again, after many hundreds of years) a viable industry. With changes in 
weather patterns and ocean currents, important problems of sustainability arise. 
 In the past, engineers have managed to satisfy most of societyâs needs, for 
increased energy, faster communications, safer and more rapid transport and more 
reliable water sources. In the future, engineers will have to be creative and 
responsive in facing the challenges and opportunities of climate change, and the 
difficult problems of sustainability. The sustainable use of water, energy and other 
scarce resources will be of particular importance. Engineering societies around the 
world now include in their code of conduct the requirement that engineers work in a 
sustainable manner: this will be critical over the next few decades. Engineering 
aspects of sustainability are discussed in Chapter 9 of this book. 
The physical infrastructure is getting smarter 
An emerging trend in engineering is the implantation of small sensors in 
engineering systems so that performance can be monitored. Sensors in buildings and 
structures monitor stress and vibrations, and can foreshadow trouble long before it 
manifests itself. Some sensors are sophisticated electronic devices, but recent 

Engineering and Society  
 
20 
 
developments have shown that much can be gained from quite simple arrangements. 
For example, carbon fibres embedded in concrete during construction as a 
strengthening measure have been found to show variable resistance based on 
whether the material is under compression or tension (Hansen, 2005). This means 
that performance can be monitored without the need to have special devices 
embedded beforehand. Research is proceeding with the development of devices that 
power themselves using vibrational energy from the structure, thus avoiding 
external power supplies.  
 Artificial intelligence has been described in terms of thinking machines and 
computers. We are only starting to see the applications of artificial intelligence, and 
we must expect an enormous expansion of its use in the near future, in fields as 
diverse as routine engineering design, financial planning, data retrieval, medical 
diagnosis and the automated guidance and operation of vehicles on land and sea, 
and in the air. When used in conjunction with the Internet of Things, the automated 
control, guidance, operation and maintenance of even the most complex devices and 
systems will become routine. 
Engineering systems are becoming progressively more complex  
The engineering systems that make up the physical infrastructure are becoming 
more sophisticated and more complex. This can lead to far-reaching and unexpected 
side effects, for example when one or more components fail or behave in an 
unexpected manner. The more complex a system becomes, the more likely it is that 
unexpected and unwanted positive feedback effects will occur.  
 Examples of such problems in complex systems have occurred recently in 
electricity power generation and distribution systems. These systems involve 
massive networks that connect many different energy sources to the distribution 
network. Because of this, there is the potential for significant problems due to 
unexpected side effects. On August 14th, 2003, a power failure affected a large 
proportion of North America and Canada, including the cities of New York, Detroit, 
Cleveland and Toronto, and left up to 60 million people without power. According 
to reports, the high speed at which the blackout spread was unexpected, as was its 
extent. In a matter of seconds, circuit breakers, installed to protect electrical 
installations from sudden and potentially damaging power surges, tripped, taking 
out entire regions. In total, more than 20 power plants were temporarily shut down, 
including nine nuclear reactors in four American states. A task force report has 
suggested that the interconnectivity of the nation's power grid, which is the reason 
for its success most of the time, leaves it vulnerable to this kind of massive failure.  
 In September 2016, the state of South Australia suffered a severe, crippling 
and prolonged blackout. Roads without traffic lights resulted in traffic disruption 
and chaos in cities and towns. With elevators unable to move, people were trapped 
in high-rise buildings, and of course in the elevators. Without refrigeration, 
supermarkets and restaurants were unable to operate, with spoilage of food. In 
hospitals, intensive-care patients had to be cared for manually when the automated 
support systems ceased to function. Although the causes are still being debated in 
2017, inadequate overall planning of the energy system undoubtedly allowed this 
disruption to occur. 
 

Engineering and Society  
 
21 
 
 The potential for such failures means that engineers must become increasingly 
involved in modelling very complex systems as a step in their designs. It is likely 
that much can be learned from natural systems, where the web of life shows that 
resilience is possible even in very complex systems. 
Engineering applications are increasingly used in medicine 
Biomedical engineering (or bioengineering) has become increasingly important and 
we can expect this trend to continue. Three of the items on the above list of 
emerging technologies are in this area. Metabolomics concerns diagnostic testing 
for diseases by analysing sugar and fat molecules that are the products of 
metabolism. Bacterial factories can use engineered bacteria to produce drugs to 
combat diseases such as malaria. Bio-mechatronics is the area of engineering that 
links robotics with the human nervous system. This has led to new artificial limbs 
that behave like the real thing and that can be controlled directly by the personâs 
brain.  
 According to Citron and Nerem (2004) bioengineering has been recognised as 
an established branch of engineering since the late 1970s. They identify two key 
applications for engineering input: diagnostic imaging (ultrasound, computer 
assisted tomography, CAT and functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI) and 
implanted therapeutic devices (e.g.,  pacemakers, cardiac rhythm stimulators, 
prosthetic heart valves, vascular stents, implanted drug pumps and neurological 
stimulators). Together, these have improved the health of large sections of the 
population, using ideas and methods that were unimaginable a few decades ago. 
 The application of nanotechnology in medicine is a related area where 
engineers have made significant progress. In 2004, Dowling (2004) reported on 
current and future developments, including better artificial implants, sensors to 
monitor human health, and improved artificial cochleae and retinas. She warned 
then that some of these might not be realised for at least ten years â which is not 
really a long lead time. Duncan (2005) gave further examples such as nanodevices 
that would diagnose problems and then deliver appropriate drugs to promote tissue 
regeneration and repair. She stated: âthese ideas may seem like science fiction but to 
dismiss them would be foolishâ. We can expect such applications to continue and 
intensify in the future. 
Engineering devices are getting smaller  
Engineers in many fields are developing and using technology on a minute scale. 
Computer engineers are currently constructing and planning computer circuits with 
wire sizes measured in nanometres (billionths of a metre). Mentioned in the list of 
emerging technologies, quantum wires are extremely low-resistance wires that use 
carbon nanotubes, where the diameter of single-walled tubes is in the order of 
nanometres. To put that in perspective, the DNA double helix has a diameter of 2 
nm, while an average human hair has a diameter around 80,000 nm. These are 
developments in the area called ânanotechnologyâ, which had its first tentative 
steps in 1959 (Gribbin and Gribbin, 1997). 
 One of the early promoters of nanotechnology was physicist and Nobel prize 
winner Richard Feynman. In 1959, around sixty years ago, he instigated two prizes: 

Engineering and Society  
 
22 
 
one for the first person to build an electric motor that would fit inside a 0.4 mm 
cube; and a second for anyone who could reduce printed text by a factor of 25,000, 
which could be read by an electron microscope. He was surprised a year later when 
someone arrived at his office carrying a large box. It contained a microscope 
(required to see the miniscule motor) and at that stage he knew he was going to have 
to pay up (which he did).  
 It took 26 years for the second prize to be claimed by a graduate student who 
had written the first page of A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens at the required 
scale. As a matter of interest, this scale would allow all 24 volumes of the 
Encyclopaedia Britannica to be written onto the head of a pin (Feynman, 1999). 
 More recently, the size of motors has been further reduced. In 2003, details 
were given of a motor that consisted of a gold rotor on a nanotube shaft that 
measured 500 nanometres across (Sanders, 2003). One consequence of such 
miniaturised devices is the enormous reduction in power required to run them. Here 
also we can expect significant future developments. 
Energy is being harvested as well as mined 
The Industrial Revolution of the 18th Century was driven by the advent of machines 
that replaced human- and animal-powered devices and which significantly increased 
output by using concentrated energy sources. Wood was initially the energy source, 
but was quickly replaced by coal, which has in part been replaced by petroleum 
products. Oil has been partially replaced by fissionable (radioactive) material. At the 
beginning of the 21st Century, oil was the dominant source of energy for much of 
the worldâs transport, heating and industry. The advantages of oil include its relative 
abundance, its concentration of energy and its low cost in relation to other energy 
sources.  
 As alternative energy sources are progressively introduced, such as solar, tidal, 
wind and wave, problems of energy density arise. The energy in the wind or in the 
waves is much less concentrated and requires significantly more physical 
infrastructure to harvest it. Further improvements in energy storage techniques 
(batteries) will assist in the use of sustainable energy sources. As the technologies 
improve, we can expect to see the use of more distributed power systems, and 
renewable energy systems. We might also see the development of efficient and 
clean methods for obtaining energy from petroleum, gas and coal. 
Existing infrastructure needs will continue, but disruptive technologies will 
change some infrastructure 
In the future, the basic needs of society are not going to disappear. They will 
continue and the basic stock of engineering infrastructure will be maintained. 
However, with the development of disruptive technologies we can expect to see the 
less efficient technologies replaced by new ones. This can be observed today with 
the relentless replacement of electronic software and printed circuits by new and 
improved generations.

1.8 SUMMARY 
Engineers have the task of creating, maintaining and extending the physical 
infrastructure that allows modern society to function. This infrastructure has 
developed over many generations, in response to the needs and demands of society, 
and has become more and more complex over time. To deal with this complexity, 
engineering work is now quite specialised, and the trend to greater specialisation 
will continue into the future.  
 To make effective use of scarce resources, engineering work is undertaken in 
individual projects with clearly stated objectives, and with specified starting times 
and completion times. Engineers work together on projects in teams, which may 
include specialist engineers and specialists from other professions.  
 Planning and design are the key activities that are used, together with 
management,  to bring engineering projects through to successful implementation.  
 The engineering profession is presently changing, and is being shaped by 
trends that have been visible for some time. Engineers are working with 
technologies that are on a scale previously unimagined: both the smallest and the 
largest. The ultra-small scale of nanotechnology is taking engineers into areas such 
as biomedical and bio-mechatronic engineering. Large-scale projects demonstrate 
the need to understand, analyse and model massive complex systems and to deal 
with unexpected side effects that result from positive feedback, which can be very 
difficult to recognise, let alone deal with effectively.  
 In the next one hundred years, engineers will be faced with the challenges of 
satisfying the needs of an increasing world population that has increasingly high 
expectations of maintaining and extending the physical infrastructure with systems 
that are economical and sustainable, and hence, of ensuring that our planet 
continues to be safe, hospitable and inhabitable.

CHAPTER TWO  
Engineering Systems Concepts 
 
One of the characteristics of the engineering infrastructure is its complexity. To 
deal with complexity, engineers use a process of decomposition whereby a complex 
object is conceptually broken down into successively smaller and simpler 
component parts until it is possible to study and analyse the individual components 
and the way they interact with each other. The systems approach provides an 
effective framework within which the work of planning, design and management can 
be conducted. In this chapter we introduce some basic systems concepts and explain 
how they are used in the modelling and analysis of engineering systems.  
2.1 INTRODUCTION 
In this chapter we introduce a methodology to deal with the problem of complexity. 
The idea is simple: a complex entity is progressively broken into smaller and 
smaller component parts until each part is so simple that it is possible to study its 
behaviour and the way it interacts with other simple parts. The planning and design 
work in a complex engineering project can also be broken down like this, into a 
number of inter-related tasks and sub-tasks that can be handled separately by 
individuals or small groups of engineers and other professionals. In this way, a large 
project which requires many thousands of hours of engineering work can be 
completed by a team of engineers in a short period of time; however, careful 
management of the team and the work is needed if it is to be successful. 
 
This approach is based on a convergent, or deductive, way of thinking, which 
is also used in engineering modelling and analysis and in many other fields of study, 
ranging from biology to corporate planning and from computer science to business 
management. To formalise the approach, we will introduce a number of basic 
systems concepts with examples.  
2.2 SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES 
The word system is used frequently, if rather vaguely, in everyday speech in phrases 
such as water supply system, communications system, political system and 
biological system. The word has already been used informally in this way in 
Chapter 1, where reference was made to water supply systems, communications 
systems, transport systems and city systems. In everyday usage, the word system 
means some complex âthingâ that is organised in some way. We shall make 
frequent use of the word, but with the following specific meaning: 
 

28 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
A system is a collection of inter-related and interacting components that 
work together in an organised manner to fulfill a specific purpose or 
function.  
 
 
An example is the water-supply system for a city and its components, which 
were described in Chapter 1. Another example is a city office building, the main 
components being the structural (load-bearing) skeleton, the cladding (the outer 
protective layer, or skin), the usable floors and inner spaces, the mechanical services 
(including elevators and air conditioning), the electrical services, the information 
technology services, the water supply service, and the waste and sewage extraction 
services. The function of this system is to provide a comfortable, sheltered, serviced 
working space in a convenient location for office workers. 
 
The word process is also used frequently but rather vaguely in everyday 
conversation. We speak of manufacturing processes, deterioration processes, and 
political, biological and chemical processes. In such usage, the word suggests some 
sequence of events that involves a progressive change in time. The corrosion that 
occurs in the small metal fasteners that join two sheets of cladding metal together is 
a process. The slow, progressive, complex changes that occur in a rainforest over 
time, either naturally or as the result of pollution and atmospheric warming, 
constitute a process. In sewage treatment works, a number of chemical and 
biological processes are employed to treat the wastewater. The word process also 
describes the complex sequence of events that occur in a human brain. In this book 
we shall use the word process with the following meaning: 
 
A process is a sequence of inter-related activities that proceeds in time. 
 
 
The seasonal movements and related cracking that occur in a house 
constructed on a reactive soil, which swells in the presence of moisture and shrinks 
in its absence, constitute a process. The construction of a bridge and the design of a 
building are processes. The planning and the design phases of an engineering 
project are also processes. A process is sometimes created by a system or a 
component of a system. 
2.3 SYSTEMS HIERARCHY 
An engineering system consists of components which in turn are made up of sub-
components. When considered closely, each sub-component is also a system in its 
own right, and made up of sub-sub-components. For example, a water treatment 
plant, which is a component of a water supply system, consists of various 
components, such as mixing and holding tanks, control valves and measuring 
devices. The holding tank is a complex construction, a system in itself, with floor 
and walls and possibly a roof constructed from reinforced concrete, and with entry 
and exit pipes that connect it to other components of the water treatment plant. The 
term subsystem is used interchangeably with component. 
 
It is a characteristic of a system that it will itself act as a component in a larger 
system, in conjunction with other systems. Thus, the water supply system is a 
component of the city system, whose other components include a transportation 

Engineering Systems Concepts 
29 
 
system, a communication system, and a sewerage system. The term system 
hierarchy describes the structure in which a higher-level system is composed of 
components that are themselves systems, made up of sub-components (or sub-
systems) and so on.  
 
The term system of systems is a term with a similar meaning to system 
hierarchy. It focusses on the upward integration of systems and components and has 
been used in fields such as transport and defence to indicate a group of systems that 
work together to produce an outcome, so that the group is superior to the sum of its 
parts. The concepts of system and sub-system will be used in Chapter 3 to assist in 
identifying and defining specific engineering problems by treating them as parts of 
wider engineering problems.  
 
Just as a physical system can be treated as a set of inter-related components, so 
can a process be broken down into a number of sub-processes. Each of these sub-
processes can in turn be broken down into sub-sub-processes. The design process is 
undertaken in small steps which are, in effect, sub-processes. Of course, the 
decomposition concept is not in any way new or novel. In another context, Jonathan 
Swift wrote:  
 
A flea hath smaller fleas that on him prey, 
and these have smaller fleas to bite âem. 
And so proceed ad infinitum. 
 
 
 
The processes of engineering planning and design 
 
Complex engineering infrastructure projects are carried out in separate but 
interrelated phases, of planning, design, implementation and maintenance. 
Careful management is needed of the entire project, and of its various phases, in 
order to bring the project to a successful conclusion. Each main phase is in itself 
a complex process and, using the decomposition approach, is broken down 
progressively into many simple, inter-related tasks that can be studied and 
evaluated individually. In this way, a large engineering project, requiring many 
thousands of hours of work, can be completed in a relatively short time period by 
groups of people working simultaneously on different tasks. Clearly, great care 
needs to be exercised in the initial breakdown of the work, and also in the 
planning, management and continuing coordination of the work of the separate 
groups, in order to ensure that an integrated outcome will actually be achieved.  
As the scale and complexity of a project increase, so too does the need for 
careful planning and design. A systematic approach to project planning has 
evolved progressively over many years and is used in all of the major 
engineering disciplines.  
Impetus was given in the 1960s to the development of a "systems" 
approach to engineering planning and design by the need to coordinate 
extremely large national projects in the United States, including the NASA space 
program.  
The processes of engineering planning and design are explained in 
Chapter 3. Various techniques that are used in the project planning phase are 
discussed in Chapter 5.

2.4 FURTHER SYSTEMS CONCEPTS 
Some additional concepts are useful in the modelling, analysis and design of 
engineering systems. They apply also to processes, but for reasons of brevity our 
discussion will concentrate on their application to systems. The concepts apply to 
real-world systems, to processes and to the theoretical and physical models that we 
use to study real-world systems. 
System boundaries 
In many engineering systems it is easy to distinguish one component from another, 
because there are clear and distinct physical boundaries. This is the case with the 
components of the water supply system previously described. However, the 
boundaries are not always clear-cut, and in some situations it may be necessary to 
introduce artificial boundaries in order to separate a system into components. For 
example, arbitrary boundaries are used in large, complex structural systems, such as 
dam walls or building skeletons or aircraft frames, when a theoretical analysis is 
carried out using the so-called finite element method. In analysing a massive dam 
wall to determine the combined effects of water pressure, gravity and earthquake 
motion, the wall is conceptually broken up, using a grid of systematically located 
boundary surfaces, into a very large number of small brick-like pieces, or âfinite 
elementsâ. By first analysing the behaviour of a typical individual element, and then 
the way it interacts locally with adjacent elements, the behaviour of the complete 
wall can be evaluated. The breakdown of the system into component elements in 
this case is not based on physical boundaries, and, from a physical point of view, is 
arbitrary. 
 
Taking another example, the fuselage, wings and tail structure are broadly 
distinguishable components of the frame of an aircraft and in the design of an 
airframe it is advantageous to deal separately with these components. Although the 
components are broadly distinguishable, there are no precise boundaries. In such 
circumstances, arbitrary boundary surfaces are chosen, so that separate analyses can 
be carried out for each component. Of course, the local interactions across the 
boundaries are vitally important, and depend in part on where the boundaries have 
been located.  
 
The concepts of system, sub-system, hierarchy and boundary provide a useful 
starting point for engineers to describe, define, analyse and design complex 
engineering systems and processes. With these concepts the processes of analysis 
and design are broken down into tasks of manageable size. The decomposition 
approach, coupled with idealisations and simplifications that are introduced in the 
modelling and analysis, allows us to deal with large engineering systems that would 
otherwise be far too complex to handle. 
Input and output 
No physical system, whether engineered or natural, is self-sufficient or cut off from 
the rest of the world. On investigation, a system will always be found to interact in 
some way with other neighbouring systems. In other words, each system is a 
component in a wider system. It is therefore necessary to look not only at an 
individual component, or for that matter at an individual system, but also at the way 

Engineering Systems Concepts 
31 
 
the system (or component) interacts with its neighbours. A system interacts with 
other systems by means of inputs and outputs. 
 
These usually (but not always) take the form of a flow of matter, energy or 
information through the boundaries of the system. The inflow, or inputs, may be 
thought of as the influence of the rest of the world on the system we are 
considering. The output, or outflow, becomes input to other systems and hence 
represents the effect of the system on the rest of the world. A system (and also a 
component) can be represented schematically as a box with lines indicating inputs 
and outputs, as in Figure 2.1. The inputs and outputs may vary in time, and are 
therefore written as time functions: y1(t), y2(t), y3(t), z1(t), and z2(t). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2.1 System with inputs and outputs. 
 
A component in a system interacts with other components through its inputs and 
outputs. A system, consisting of components, each with inputs and outputs, can be 
represented schematically, as in Figure 2.2, by boxes to denote the components and 
by lines between the boxes to represent the inputs and outputs.  
 
The input and output lines joining any two individual boxes represent the 
direct interactions between these two components. Additional indirect interactions 
may occur between two components via intermediate components. The inputs and 
outputs to the overall system are inputs and outputs to individual components, as 
shown in Figure 2.2.

Returning to the example of the water supply system, we have as system inputs the 
inflow of water into the reservoirs from the catchment areas. The quantity and 
quality of the water flowing from reservoir to reservoir and from component to 
component are input and output variables for the components.

An example of inputs and outputs that do not fall into the categories of matter, 
energy and information is provided by a structural load-bearing system which picks 
up applied loads and carries them into the supports, as shown in Figure 2.4. The pin-
jointed frame is the system, while the tensile and compressive members and the 
joints are the components.  
 
Most engineering students study such systems in introductory courses in the 
mechanics of solids. The inputs and outputs for these components are forces. The 
loads, applied at joints A and B, are the inputs to the system, while the reactions at 
joints C, D and E are the system outputs. The relations between output and input 
forces are presented in Figure 2.4(d). In a more complex structural system the inputs 
and outputs between neighbouring components might be stress fields that are  
distributed across the contact areas between components, together with the 
associated strain fields.

As we have seen, a real system might, but might not, display clear-cut natural 
internal boundaries among its components. The boundaries tend to be clear-cut if 
the sub-components separate themselves out from each other into clusters, with 
relatively few inputs from one cluster to another. Figure 2.5 shows schematics of 
two systems, one with natural internal boundaries, and the other without. Natural 
boundaries occur where there are fewest input-output connections among the sub-
components. Even when it becomes necessary, for analysis or design, to break a 
complex system into arbitrary components, it is advantageous to choose the 
boundaries in such a way that the resulting inputs and outputs among the 
components are as few and as simple as possible. 
Black-box systems and components 
In order to achieve an overview of the functioning of a system component, it is not 
always necessary to study the internal functioning of the sub-components. In fact, 
by avoiding detail and by concentrating on the overall input-output relations among 
components, it is often possible to achieve a good overview of the behaviour of the 
system. When the detailed internal functioning within a component or system is 
ignored, and it is regarded simply as a device that transforms inputs into outputs, it 
can be thought of as a black box. 
 
 
  
Figure 2.6 Black-box analysis: rainfall-runoff relations for a catchment area. 
 
An example of a black-box representation of a component is the use of equations to 
calculate the run-off from a catchment area in terms of the rainfall history. In a very 
simple model, a time delay and a transformation are applied to the time history of 
the rainfall (the input) in order to represent the run-off (the output) as a second time 
history, as indicated in Figure 2.6.  
 
A highly simplified and idealised treatment of a complete system can often be 
obtained by lumping closely linked components together and replacing them by 
black boxes with simple inputs and outputs. Such simplified treatments are often 
very valuable, for example at the preliminary stage of an analysis or of a design, 
when an accurate consideration of the functioning of the system is not needed. The

idea of black-box components is used in electronic engineering for an arrangement 
of transistors, resistors and capacitors, assembled to fulfill a specific function. Such 
a device, designed to detect fish, is shown in Figure 2.7.

Permissionâ) 
Control systems 
Engineering systems operate with the purpose of achieving a specified goal. If the 
goal can be quantified, it may be possible to introduce a control device as a 
component to control the performance of the system and make it goal-seeking. The 
control device may be linked to a sensor that measures the condition of the system 
and sends the relevant information to the control device.  
 
 
Figure 2.8 Closed-loop control system. 
 
The actual condition (or state) can then be compared with a desired or target 
condition, and a control signal can then be sent to another component in the system 
to initiate changes that move the system progressively towards the target condition. 
This arrangement, shown in Figure 2.8, is a feedback control system, or closed-loop 
control system. 
 
A simple example of a control system is an air-conditioned room (Figure 2.9). 
The desired air temperature is pre-set by the user. The thermometer senses the 
temperature in the room, and the control component switches the conditioning unit 
on when the difference between the measured and the target temperatures exceeds a 
specified margin.

Another example is the traffic control lights at a road intersection, where 
sensors are used to detect and measure the volume of traffic flowing into and out of 
the intersection in all directions. A simple control device calculates the optimal 
green times for the flow of traffic in each direction, and a control signal is sent 
periodically to change the lights. While such localised traffic control systems are 
still used occasionally, it is far more common to use more sophisticated control 
systems to deal with the traffic in larger sectors of a city, including many 
intersections. The traffic density is measured continuously in key streets and 
intersections and the information is sent back to a central computer system which 
has been programmed to calculate a sequence of signal settings to control local 
flows and minimise overall flow time through the road system. 
  
 
Figure 2.10 Open-loop control system 
 
 
A simpler, but less effective arrangement for a control system is shown in 
Figure 2.10. The feedback control loop has been omitted and so the arrangement is 
called, somewhat illogically, an open-loop control system. As an example, we may 
consider a set of traffic lights at an intersection that operates without traffic flow 
counters. The pre-set timing of the lights is chosen to allow for, say, normal peak 
hour traffic flow. Obviously such a system cannot deal successfully with 
unexpected or unusual events, such as traffic accidents or heavy rain.

The state of a system 
The concept of system state is used in analytic studies of the behaviour of dynamic 
systems, that is to say, systems that experience progressive changes in time. The 
state of such a system is represented by a set of key variables, called the state 
variables. The values of the state variables at any given instant in time completely 
define the condition of the system and take into account the effects of all previous 
states and all inputs up to that instant. The state variables are used to predict the 
state of the system at succeeding times (Ashby, 1965a, 1965b). 
 
When a medical practitioner investigates the state of health of a patient by 
measuring blood pressure, heart rate, condition of the eyes, chemistry of the blood 
and urine (counts of red and white blood cells, levels of cholesterol, triglycerol, uric 
acid, and sugar), the values represent a primitive set of state variables which 
indicate, very approximately, the state of health of the patient. The patient is of 
course a highly complex biological system, and is much more complex than the 
simplified state model being used in the health check.  
 
The idea of system state contrasts with the black-box representation previously 
described, because, in evaluating the state of the system, we look at its internal 
functioning and not just at the inputs and outputs. The treatment of system 
behaviour as a sequence of changing states will be discussed further when we look 
at methods of analysis.  
 
From a formal mathematical viewpoint, the state of a system can be 
represented using a multi-dimensional space in which each state variable has an axis 
allocated to it. If there are n state variables, then the state space has n dimensions. 
The state of the system is represented by a point in state space and the behaviour of 
the system over time traces a line in state space. Although state space concepts are 
used mainly for dynamic systems, the idea of state can be seen in Figure 2.4, where 
the state of the tension-bar system is represented by the four forces in the bars, x1, 
x2, x3 and x4. The state variables in this case depend purely on the system inputs, 
which are the forces y1, y2 and y3. An example of state space analysis for a linear 
dynamic system is presented in the appendix to this chapter. 
Equilibrium and stability 
Equilibrium and stability are vitally important concepts in engineering, and indeed 
in many other fields of study. These ideas are best explained using state space 
concepts. A system is in an equilibrium state if there is no tendency for it to move 
away from that state unless it is forced by external disturbances. The equilibrium 
state is represented by a point in state space. Depending on the complexity of the 
system, there may be more than one equilibrium state, or no equilibrium state at all. 
In a very complex non-linear system, there may even be small regions of state space 
in which the system will remain, moving around in a near-equilibrium condition 
unless it is forced away by external inputs. On the other hand, a system can be kept 
in a state of pseudo-equilibrium by controlling the inputs to maintain the state of the 
system at or close to the desired point in state space. An example of this is when a 
helicopter hovers: it is being held close to a point in three-dimensional space by the 
pilot. 
 
The concept of system equilibrium is applicable in many fields other than 
engineering, such as economics and biology. An example of an engineering system 

Engineering Systems Concepts 
39 
 
in equilibrium is a building structure that safely supports the vertical loads on its 
floors and resists the horizontal wind loads that act on its external walls. The state 
variables of the system include the internal forces induced in the component 
members in response to the loads, and also the deformations and deflections that 
result from the loads.  
 
We speak about the stability of a system in relation to its equilibrium states. A 
system is in a stable state of equilibrium if it returns to the same equilibrium state 
after it has been disturbed. If, following a small disturbance, the system moves 
progressively away from an equilibrium state, then that state of equilibrium is 
unstable. A system is in a state of neutral equilibrium if, following a slight 
disturbance, it does not return to the equilibrium state, nor move further away.  
 
A building structure, consisting of slabs supported on beams and columns and 
carrying vertical floor loads, can be tested for stability by applying horizontal loads 
at the different floor levels and then removing them. The test may be carried out 
mathematically on a theoretical model, in the laboratory on a physical model, or 
may even be carried out on the real system. If the system returns to its original state 
with the same original internal forces upon the removal of the disturbing horizontal 
loads, it is in a stable equilibrium state. If, however, the building is potentially 
unstable, the small horizontal forces could induce large lateral displacements with 
buckling failure of the columns, followed by complete collapse of the building.  
 
Of course, the response of a system to a disturbance depends on the magnitude 
of the disturbance. If the disturbance is large, a stable system may be damaged or 
even destroyed and will not then be capable of returning to its equilibrium state. A 
bomb blast or earthquake, if sufficiently intense, will bring an otherwise stable 
structural frame to the point of destruction. It is therefore useful to describe a stable 
system as one for which the response to a disturbance is not out of proportion to the 
magnitude of the disturbance. It is frequently necessary to investigate the 
equilibrium condition (or conditions) of a system and its stability in relation to its 
equilibrium states. Methods of equilibrium analysis and stability analysis are 
available, both for static and dynamic systems (Bazant and Cedolin, 1991).  
System coefficients 
The main system variables consist of the input and output variables and the state 
variables. The latter represent the progressive behaviour of the system in time, or, 
more precisely, the behaviour of the system model. However, various other 
quantities are needed to define the model. These are called the system coefficients. 
They are inherent properties of the system and its components. System coefficients, 
in contrast with the system variables, are usually fixed in value and represent the 
unchanging physical characteristics of the system. For example, in the frame in 
Figure 2.4 the lengths of the component members, the coordinates of the various 
joints, and the stiffness properties of the components are the system coefficients that 
are used to model the structural system. System coefficients typically include the 
properties of the materials comprising the system, and its geometry. Unlike the state 
variables and the output variables, they do not usually change in value in response 
to changes in the input variables.  
 
Nevertheless, some system coefficients may change slowly in time, not in 
response to the applied inputs but because the system itself is gradually changing. 

40 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
For example, some engineering materials change their properties in time. The 
modulus of elasticity of concrete (its stiffness) increases slowly with time, because 
of complex chemical changes that occur in the material. Progressive changes in 
system coefficients can occur if there is deterioration, as for example when there is 
corrosion of steel, abrasive removal of layers of material in a pipe, or scouring and 
erosion of the bed of a stream.  
 
If one or more of the system coefficients vary significantly in time, then it may 
be advisable to restructure the model of the system, to treat the varying quantities 
not as coefficients but as system variables. This is the case when stream erosion is 
severe and a stream bed moves progressively over time, thus changing the geometry 
of the system. When this occurs, it becomes necessary to move from a fixed bed 
model to a movable bed model that can deal with the erosion.  
Optimisation 
An engineering system has to have a clearly stated set of goals and objectives if it is 
to be designed, created and operated. Identification of the goals and objectives is an 
important step in the processes of planning and design. The aim of the engineer is to 
achieve the best possible solution, or possibly the most economical solution, for any 
constraints that have to be satisfied. The term optimisation refers to the process of 
finding the best, or optimal, solution. 
 
Optimisation techniques can sometimes be employed to find the best solution 
to a mathematically formulated problem, irrespective of its physical nature. In 
optimising a system or a process, it is necessary not only to identify the goals and 
objectives but also to quantify these goals. The process of optimisation is otherwise 
useless. Specific optimisation techniques are discussed in Chapter 13 of this book.  
The error of sub-optimisation 
It is important to understand that optimisation of the overall system is not usually 
achieved by independently optimising each of its individual components. Indeed, 
such an approach can lead to serious malfunction of a complex system. The 
optimisation of even one of the components in isolation may be detrimental to the 
overall system. The term, error of sub-optimisation, is used for this important idea 
and refers to the process of optimising one or more system components to the 
detriment of overall system performance.  
 
Examples of sub-optimisation should make the matter clear. In the design of 
an aircraft, the aim is to achieve optimal overall performance. If the engines are 
designed to achieve maximum performance without due regard to their fitting into 
the airframe, to their size and weight, and to the way they work in conjunction with 
the airframe, then the result will be less than optimal as far as the aircraft is 
concerned. Indeed if the engines were designed disregarding the other components, 
it is unlikely that the aircraft would fly. 
 
A type of sub-optimisation error can occur in the structural design of buildings 
if a minimum weight solution is sought, on the assumption that this will lead to a 
minimum use of materials and hence to minimum cost. In fact, minimum weight 
rarely leads to minimum cost. Structural systems designed for minimum use of 
materials are usually extremely difficult to construct, and therefore very costly. The 
additional costs of construction far outweigh the savings in materials in a typical 

Engineering Systems Concepts 
41 
 
building structure. On the other hand, minimum weight is far more important in the 
design of a space vehicle because of the advantages in regard to payload and fuel 
use.  
 
The design of an engineering system is always a compromise, whereby each 
component has to be tuned, not to perform optimally in itself, but to contribute to 
the optimal performance of the overall system. Sub-optimisation errors are prone to 
occur in large projects when insufficient contact and communication occur among 
the different groups of engineers working on the different components, which 
eventually have to be brought together. An important task in project planning and 
management is to avoid, or at least minimise, errors of sub-optimisation. 
2.5 MODELLING AND ANALYSIS  
In order both to create new pieces of infrastructure and to maintain and improve 
existing ones, we must be able to predict how real engineering systems and 
processes will behave in the future, under both normal and unusual operating 
conditions. Often we have to make such predictions before the systems and 
processes have even been created. We rely on modelling and analysis to do this. 
These terms are closely related in meaning, and are sometimes used 
interchangeably. Nevertheless, it will be useful for us to distinguish between the 
terms.  
Mathematical models  
The process of creating a simplified, idealised representation of a real-world system 
is referred to here as modelling, and the simplified representation is a model. The 
purpose of the model is to mimic the behaviour of the real system to an acceptable 
level of accuracy. The model is the starting point for analysis, which is the term that 
describes the activity of using the model in order to predict how the real engineering 
system and its components will behave when subjected to a specific set of operating 
conditions and environmental conditions.  
 
In current engineering work, a model is most often in the form of a set of 
mathematical equations or computer algorithms, which we call a mathematical 
model. The analysis is then theoretical, and involves computations that are often 
complex, and usually undertaken by computer. Before powerful computing facilities 
became available, much greater reliance had to be placed by engineers on physical 
models, which will be discussed shortly.  
Use of mathematical models in theoretical analysis  
The improvements in computing hardware and software that have occurred in recent 
decades have allowed mathematical modelling and analysis to be undertaken for a 
wide range of engineering problems.  
 
The processes of mathematical modelling and analysis of a physical system 
are indicated in the schematic in Figure 2.11, which shows the steps used to predict 
how an existing system or a proposed new system will respond to a specific set of 
operating conditions and inputs. There are three processes in Figure 2.11 and they 
are represented by the arrowed lines denoted as A, B, and C. 

42 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
 
Process A represents the creation of a conceptual model that consists of a set 
of equations or algorithms. This is a simplified representation of the real system, but 
it shows how the real system will behave under a variety of different conditions and 
inputs. Process B is the theoretical analysis of the system model for a specific set of 
operating conditions and inputs. Approximations and idealisations always have to 
be made in the modelling process, and sometimes also in the calculations that 
comprise Process B. It is therefore necessary to consider carefully the effects on the 
predicted behaviour of all the simplifications and approximations that have been 
introduced in Processes A and B. This is the role of Process C. In Process C, the 
behaviour of the real-world system is predicted using the results of the analysis of 
the theoretical model, and information about the approximations made in Processes 
A and B. Only if the modelling Process A and the analysis Process B are very 
accurate, will the model behaviour be a very good prediction of the behaviour of the 
real system.  
 
Figure 2.11 Modelling and analysis to predict system behaviour. 
 
 
 
To complete the picture, the operation of the real system, under the same 
operating conditions and inputs as were assumed in the analysis, is shown as 
Process D in Figure 2.12. There are always differences between the behaviour of the 
real system and the predictions of the modelling and analysis, but the more accurate 
the modelling, analysis and interpretation, the closer will be the correspondence 
between real behaviour and predicted behaviour. Analysis is an essential tool in the 
design of engineering systems. 
Physical models 
As already mentioned, there are some systems that are too complex to lend 
themselves to theoretical analysis or computer simulation. They require physical 

Engineering Systems Concepts 
43 
 
modelling. The physical model may be the same size as the physical system to be 
studied, but it will often be necessary to scale-up or scale-down the model so that it 
can be created and tested in the laboratory. For example, complex coastal 
engineering processes are often studied using scaled-down physical models, which 
are constructed in large laboratory tanks. 
 
Figure 2.12 Real system behaviour. 
 
 
The experimental results from tests on a physical model are used to predict 
how the real system will behave under a given set of conditions. In such cases the 
analysis phase requires an interpretation of the test data, with allowance for various 
factors that depend on the modelling, such as size effect.  
 
 
Figure 2.13 Use of physical modelling to predict system behaviour. 
 
The steps in the creation and use of a physical model are shown as A1, A2, B and C 
in Figure 2.13. Steps A1 and A2 together represent the creation of the model, which 
begins with some conceptualisation (Step A1) and then the physical work of 
constructing the model (Step A2). In the construction of a physical model,

simplification and idealisation are just as necessary as in the case of mathematical 
modelling. This occurs in Step A1. 
 
Physical models that have a similar appearance to the original system are 
sometimes referred to as iconic models. It is also possible to create dissimilar 
models that do not resemble the original physical system at all. For example, 
electrical circuits can be used to represent groundwater flow. Such dissimilar 
models can be created when the same set of underlying mathematical relations 
applies to two different physical situations.  
 
If a physical system is going to be used in large quantities, it may be possible 
to test prototypes. A full scale prototype axle shaft for a new car would for example 
be tested in the laboratory for fatigue, while complete cars would be used in safety 
tests. On the other hand, a chemical engineer may create a scaled-down laboratory 
model of a proposed chemical engineering process. Structural engineers often 
construct small-scale physical models of tall buildings to observe the effects of 
complex gust loadings in a wind tunnel.  
 
A scaled-down, physical, iconic model of a coastal breakwater in a laboratory 
is shown in Figure 2.14. An adjustable wave-making machine, seen in the 
foreground, simulates extreme weather conditions. Using this physical model, 
various breakwater geometries can be tested in the laboratory and their 
performances compared.

Dealing with too much information 
In order to create a model (either physical or mathematical) of an engineering 
system, the problem of complexity has to be dealt with. The concepts of system and 
hierarchy can be useful in this regard. However, there is another related problem. 
Simply put, there is usually too much information available about a real system, and 
most of the information will be either irrelevant or of marginal value when a model 

Engineering Systems Concepts 
45 
 
(either mathematical or physical) is to be created. It is necessary to separate out the 
aspects of the system that have an important influence on the behaviour that is to be 
studied, and those aspects which are of marginal or zero importance. An important 
step in modelling thus involves discarding irrelevant information. Initially it may be 
difficult to decide which information to keep and which to discard. Engineering 
experience and judgement are relevant, and the decision becomes easier when the 
behaviour of the system is better understood. The amount of information retained (if 
carefully chosen) can also determine how accurate the model will be.  
 
If we wish to model a component of a bridge, say a slab which carries 
wheel loads and transfers them to a supporting girder, the factors of prime 
structural importance will be the size and shape of the slab and the stiffness and 
strength properties of the materials. The colour of the components and the surface 
details of the road on top of the slab will not be of relevance and will be discarded, 
even for the most accurate analysis. However, this information could be important 
if an analysis of temperature effects were to be undertaken. Separating out the 
important from the unimportant is equally necessary in mathematical modelling 
and in constructing a physical model.  
 
Occamâs Razor 
 
William of Ockham (or Occam) was an English philosopher who lived in the 14th 
Century. He was an empiricist who wrote on science and logic, and argued that 
logic should be separated from theology and metaphysics. His statement in 
Latin, and in English translation, has become known as Occamâs Razor: 
 
Essentia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem. 
 
(Do not multiply hypotheses beyond necessity.) 
 
In the context of engineering modelling and analysis, Occamâs Razor is an 
argument for simplicity. According to this principle, of two equally accurate 
theories or explanations the simpler is always to be preferred. It follows that we 
should keep our models as simple as possible, and introduce no more 
assumptions than are absolutely necessary. A modern equivalent might be the 
well-known motto used in engineering design: KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid). 
 
The trade-off between complexity and accuracy  
In engineering modelling it is not possible or even desirable to take full account of 
all of the complexities of the real system. Some trade-off between accuracy and 
simplicity is always made in the modelling process. It follows that there can be no 
single âcorrectâ model of a real system. On the contrary, there will be an unlimited 
number of possible models that vary in complexity and accuracy, depending on the 
degree of idealisation employed in the modelling process. There will rarely be a 
single âbestâ model.  
 
Although a simple model will necessarily have limited accuracy, it has the 
advantage that quick (but approximate) answers can be obtained, and, possibly, a 
good overview of the functioning of the system. It is often of benefit to designers 
and analysts to have several alternative models available, including a simple, rough 

46 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
model and an accurate, detailed model. Designers will use simple models in the 
early conceptual stages of the design process and the accurate, more complex, 
models when they are working out the final design details. A very simple 
calculation, using a simplified model, can also be used to make order-of-magnitude 
checks on a very complex set of computer calculations. 
 
 
Modelling and Formula 1 cars 
 
A key aim in the design of Formula 1 cars is to minimise the drag they 
experience when they are being driven at high speed. Early difficulties in 
mathematical modelling led to the use of physical modelling to predict drag. This 
involves much more than building the car to a convenient scale and then blowing 
air past it. The way the system behaves must be understood and the tests 
designed accordingly. For example, It is relatively easy to build a 1/10th scale 
model of a car, but there are questions to be answered, such as: what air speed 
to use? If it is a 1/10th scale model, then perhaps the air speed should also be 
1/10 of that expected, say 30 km/h to model the full scale 300 km/h? This is not 
correct. In fact, drag is an inverse function of scale, so that if the physical 
dimensions are reduced by a factor of 10, then the air speed must be increased 
by a factor of 10! The correct answer would be 3000 km/h. At this speed there 
are other problems (such as breaking the sound barrier) that spoil the modelling. 
It is necessary to test at as large a scale as possible, and this means that a huge 
wind tunnel would be needed to test a full size car. 
Problems with testing large-scale physical models led to the development 
of sophisticated computer models that can deal accurately with many of the 
processes involved in drag. These now provide a viable alternative to testing 
physical models. One computer model, called FLUENT, has been developed by 
Sauber Petronas and Fluent Inc. It computes and displays the flow lines around 
a formula one car. For details see:  http://www.fluent.com/about/news/pr/ 
pr81.htm.  
An analytical model can only be created to predict the behaviour of a 
system if the physical principles that govern behaviour are well understood. The 
model may then be a set of equations that comprise a mathematical model. With 
the advent and widespread use of powerful computer facilities, it is common to 
use  mathematical models, with lengthy computations, to study the behaviour of 
quite complex engineering systems. Today, mathematical models are normally 
cheaper to prepare and use than physical models. 
 
Reliability and numerical stability 
To be acceptable and useful, a model has to satisfy a number of important 
requirements. First and foremost, it must capture the essential behaviour of the real 
system, otherwise it could lead to erroneous and dangerous conclusions. A process 
of validation is used to check the reliability of the model and to determine its likely 
accuracy, and the order of magnitude of prediction errors. There are various ways of 
validating a model, but generally this requires comparisons between model 
predictions and the observed behaviour of a real physical system. If the modelling is 
being undertaken for the design of a new, not yet existing system, then verification 
can  be undertaken by comparing model predictions with the behaviour of similar 

Engineering Systems Concepts 
47 
 
real systems that have been previously constructed and tested. Physical models, 
tested in the laboratory, can also provide data for evaluating the adequacy and 
accuracy of a conceptual model. In some situations it is possible to calibrate a new 
model against an existing model that has itself been validated. 
 
The potential accuracy of any analysis depends on the underlying model. 
However, misuse of a model can lead to inaccuracy, with dangerous results. A 
careful interpretation of the results of every analysis is therefore needed to identify 
possible differences between the real system and the model. This is an essential step 
in any analysis and was referred to in the discussion of Figures 2.11 and 2.12. 
 
Validation becomes crucially important when we model complex systems, 
particularly non-linear systems, because some effects, such as positive feedback, are 
non-intuitive and are difficult to recognise. Unfortunately, the more complex the 
system, the more difficult it is to validate the model.  
 
Yet another requirement of a conceptual mathematical model is numerical 
stability. That is to say, computational problems should not arise when the model is 
used to analyse a range of different systems, or a single system with varying 
coefficients and varying inputs and operating conditions. Numerical instability is a 
common bugbear of mathematical modelling, and is particularly likely to appear 
when non-linear system models are being used. 
 
Numerical instability can lead to non-convergence of certain operations, so that 
the calculations cannot proceed to their end. Even when the computations proceed to 
a conclusion, numerical instability can lead to serious errors in the results.  
2.6 ENGINEERING ANALYSIS  
Many different types of analysis can be carried out for a given physical system or 
problem, depending not only on the specific aspects of behaviour to be investigated, 
but also on the type and accuracy of the model being used. We shall look briefly at 
some of the forms of engineering analysis that are commonly undertaken.  
 
If the real system displays significant variability in its response to repeated, 
apparently identical inputs, then it may be necessary to undertake a probabilistic 
analysis. Alternatively, a statistical analysis could be undertaken with the 
coefficients and inputs treated as random variables. Another possibility is to use a 
deterministic model, but to carry out a sensitivity analysis by making a large number 
of computational runs while systematically varying the values of the system inputs 
and coefficients. Sensitivity analyses can also be used when the coefficients or 
inputs are not known precisely, but only statistically. A large number of runs might 
also be undertaken with randomly generated values of the coefficients and inputs, in 
order to look at the variability to be expected.  
 
On the other hand, variability might be ignored in favour of a simple, 
deterministic input-output analysis for the overall system. This could be appropriate 
when approximate estimates of behaviour are needed. An input-output analysis may 
be thought of as a causal relationship between input (cause) and output (effect). 
Alternatively, it may be useful to consider that the system executes a process that 
transforms the input into output.  
 
 
In a more basic analysis, the behaviour of the individual components will be 
examined, as well as the way they interact with each other. Scientific and 

48 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
engineering principles will be drawn on from the areas of knowledge relevant to the 
particular physical system.  
 
It is a characteristic of real systems that their behaviour changes over time. If 
the changes occur rapidly, dynamic effects become important and so a dynamic 
system analysis should be undertaken, using a dynamic system model. State space 
analysis is used to study dynamic system behaviour. An advantage of state space 
analysis is that the equations of state are in a very convenient form for computation. 
The n equations of state for an n-dimensional system show the rate of change of 
each state variable with respect to time, as a function of the current values of all the 
state variables. This is very easy to program for a computer. An example of state-
space analysis, with a set of state equations, is given in the appendix to this chapter. 
 
If the changes do not take place rapidly over time, it may be possible to ignore 
the time dependent effects and use a static (or steady-state) analysis. For example, 
in modelling a bridge to study the effects of highway traffic, consideration will be 
given to braking, impact and collision and this will require dynamic analysis; on the 
other hand, dynamic loads might be approximated by static loads in modelling a 
small building constructed in a seismically inactive area.  
Computer methods and computer simulation 
A computer is normally used to carry out the detailed calculations required for the 
analysis of a complex engineering system. This increases enormously the quantity 
of information that can be generated. In fact, the form of the analysis and the form 
of the underlying model are sometimes adapted to suit the available computer 
software. This is because a large number of standardised computer software 
packages are commercially available in most engineering fields that can be applied 
to problems of analysis and design. 
 
The software packages are written to deal with a general class of problem. 
Thus it is often the case in engineering work that an appropriate software package is 
first chosen, and then the modelling and analysis decisions are undertaken in a way 
that is compatible with the software.  
 
Computer simulation of the behaviour of a system is made by calculating 
successive values of the state variables (or input-output variables) over an extended 
period of time for a prescribed set of operating conditions and system coefficients.  
The aim of computer simulation is to give a detailed picture of the way the real 
system will behave should it be subjected to the operating conditions chosen for the 
analysis. System simulations can be repeated many times with systematically varied 
values of the coefficients and inputs in order to observe the sensitivity of the 
predicted behaviour to variations in the system properties. A sequence of such 
calculations has previously been referred to as a âsensitivity analysis.â  
 
The term Monte-Carlo analysis is used to describe repeated analyses 
undertaken with randomly chosen variations in system characteristics and inputs. 
Such analyses can be used to determine the effects of random variations on system 
performance. This in turn provides a means of studying stochastic system effects. 
The values of the coefficients and inputs are determined by random sampling from 
frequency distributions which represent variable real-world quantities.

Modelling complex physical systems and processes 
 
The modelling work that has been undertaken in an effort to manage and 
maintain the River Murray mouth in South Australia provides a good example of 
how a range of models of varying complexity can be used. The aerial photograph 
below shows the mouth as it was in April 2000, choked by a large influx of sand 
and with a small number of channels allowing water to flow into the lagoon 
adjacent to the land. 
 
 
 
Figure 2.15 Areal view of chocked mouth of the River Murray (2000). 
 
Reduced river flows due to increased irrigation and upstream usage had 
led to large deposits of sand inside the mouth area, brought by the tides that 
flood in twice daily. In an optimisation study of river discharges, two numerical 
models were developed: a simple, one-dimensional model that represented the 
state of the mouth by a single number (the cross-sectional area), and a complex 
three-dimensional model of the mouth, its channels and sandy islands over an 
area of several square kilometres. While the detailed three-dimensional model 
could be used to evaluate discharge options and to give predictions of which 
channels would be choked with sediment and which would run freely, it took 
approximately one day of computer time to simulate one day of operation. 
Simulations of anything over a month were thus impossible due to time 
constraints. While the one-dimensional model could not predict what was 
happening to individual channels, it did allow a 100-year simulation of the mouth 
size to be undertaken in a matter of minutes and gave a useful prediction of the 
long-term fate of the mouth of the river. 
 

50 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
The results of the large numbers of analyses can then be used to create frequency 
distributions to represent system behaviour, thus avoiding a probabilistic analysis of 
the problem.  
 
In the case of complex non-linear systems, behaviour can be almost impossible 
to anticipate intuitively. Modelling, analysis and validation then become critically 
important. The only feasible approach is to use models that have been developed 
specifically for computer analysis. State space concepts and state space analysis are 
very useful in such circumstances.   
 
 
Global Warming: modelling and analysis 
 
The earth, together with its oceans and atmosphere, forms what is now 
known to be a highly complex system that is acted on by the sun and moon and 
other celestial bodies. This understanding is relatively new and it is interesting to 
see how it has developed (and continues to develop) with time. 
In the early 19th century Joseph Fourier determined that without the earthâs 
atmosphere, normal surface temperatures would be below freezing. In 1859 
John Tyndall tested a number of the atmosphereâs components and found that 
while oxygen and nitrogen were ineffective at trapping heat, methane and carbon 
dioxide were effective. The first two greenhouse gases had been identified. In 
1896 Svante Arrhenius suggested that if for some reason carbon dioxide levels 
were to rise, for example as a result of increased volcanic activity, this could lead 
to a general warming which in turn would increase atmospheric moisture, and 
this would create a feedback loop and further warming. These processes, 
including the feedback between temperature and atmospheric moisture, might be 
shown as in Figure 2.16, which is of course a highly idealised model of the 
atmosphere because it ignores many other important processes.   
 
 
 
Figure 2.16 Feedback loop in global warming. 
  
Other factors that are now believed to be important include cloud cover, ice 
and snow cover, the oceans and their ability to store heat and absorb carbon 
dioxide, the ocean currents, the earthâs ecosystems that act as both sources and 
sinks for carbon dioxide, man-made features such as aeroplanes and their 
exhaust contrails. The list goes on. Many of these have significant feedback 
effects and it is for this reason that there are so many arguments about global 
climate change. In all this uncertainty, one thing is certain: it would not be 
possible to model the climate without a systems approach to describe and 
quantify the actions, reactions and interactions between all the processes at 
work. 
 
 
 
Complex, counter-intuitive behaviour in systems was demonstrated by 
Forrester (1971), one of the early pioneers in the use of numerical modelling and

Atmosphere

computer simulation of complex system behaviour. Forrester used the idea of 
positive and negative feedback loops to show how apparently simple changes can 
lead to unexpected and drastic outcomes. An example of a positive feedback loop is 
the effect of birth rate on population. Over time, even a small positive birth rate 
leads to an exponentially increasing population because of the compounding effect. 
In contrast, the death rate has a negative feedback effect on population. When 
several such opposing feedback effects occur simultaneously, the results can be very 
difficult to anticipate.  
 
An example of modelling a system with such feedback effects was given by 
DÃ¶rner (1996), who investigated the problem of controlling excessively bad odours 
in a small pond. Some of the feedback effects he considered were related to 
temperature, oxygen, organic and inorganic substances present in the pond, and the 
anaerobic microorganism population.  
2.7 SUMMARY 
System concepts are valuable tools in the work of engineering planning and design. 
In this chapter we have introduced the ideas of system and process, sub-components 
and hierarchy, input and output, state, equilibrium and stability, and system goals 
and optimisation. A system model is a simplified and idealised representation of a 
real physical system or process. It may be a physical laboratory model or a 
conceptual (mathematical) model. Conceptual models provide the starting point for 
mathematical analyses that predict how a real system behaves under a given set of 
operating conditions. The process of engineering modelling has been briefly 
described and some of the main types of analysis have been discussed. 
 
System concepts are also useful in dealing with the complexity that is inherent 
in engineering systems and in problem solving. A decomposition process is used, 
whereby a system is broken down progressively into smaller components and sub-
components that are so simple that we can study how they behave individually and 
how they interact with each other. Complexity is also dealt with by discarding 
irrelevant information.  
 
In Chapter 3 we will see how these concepts are used in planning and design.

APPENDIX 2A: EXAMPLE OF STATE-SPACE ANALYSIS 
To show how a set of equations of state can be developed, we consider the dynamic 
analysis of the two-storey frame shown in Figure 2.17. The building is subjected to 
horizontal loads due to wind or earthquake. 
 
To idealise and simplify our analysis, we assume that the floors are stiff in 
comparison to the columns and move laterally under the influence of the horizontal 
forces, as indicated in Figure 2.17(a), and do not bend. To further simplify our 
model, we assume that the wind forces y1(t) and y2(t), act at the first and second 

Engineering Systems Concepts

floor levels. They are the input variables, and vary over time. As the floors move 
horizontally, the supporting columns deflect accordingly, as in Figure 2.17(a). 
 
We now choose appropriate state variables to represent the condition of the 
system. The horizontal displacements at the floor levels, x1(t) and x2(t), are clearly 
appropriate choices, but these two variables alone are not sufficient to specify the 
state of the system: initial values of these two variables at some starting time t0, 
x1(t0) and x2(t0), do not contain enough information to allow all future states to be 
calculated when an input history, y1(t) and y2(t), is stipulated.  
 
We need to include two further state variables and we choose the velocities of 
the floors as the additional variables. Denoting the velocities as x3 and x4, we have:

If initial values of these four state variables are known at time t0, a dynamic 
analysis will allow us to determine all subsequent states of the system for a known 
history of the input variables. The equations of state for this simplified and idealised 
system are derived from simple dynamic principles.  
 
The top floor is represented as a point mass which is accelerating under the 
resultant of the two forces acting on it. One of these forces is the applied load y2(t); 
the other is the restraining force exerted on the floor by the tops of both second 
storey columns. The stiffness of the two columns together is k2 Newtons per mm. 
This means that a force of k2 Newtons, applied to the columns at the top floor level, 
would produce a movement of 1 mm, relative to the bottoms of the columns at the 
first floor. Using Newtonâs law of motion, we equate the total force acting on the 
top floor to the mass times the acceleration, to obtain: 
 
 
 
 
(2.3) 
 
From Equation (2.3) and the definition of the fourth state variable (Equation 2.2), 
we obtain the following state equation: 
 
 
 
 
(2.4) 
 
 
Similar considerations apply to the mass at the first floor. In this case, however, 
there are three forces acting on the mass: the horizontal load y2(t); the force from 
both second floor columns acting on the mass; and the force from both first floor 
columns acting on the mass. We thus obtain another state equation that represents 
the dynamics of the first floor mass. The four state equations, including Equation 
2.4, are thus:

These equations of state are in what is called the ânormal form,â whereby the time 
rate of change (the first derivative with respect to time) of each state variable is 
expressed as a function of the current values of the state variables and the inputs. 
The equations of state allow us to calculate the incremental change in each state 
variable over the next small time interval from the current values of the state 
variables.  
 
The normal form of Equations (2.4) to (2.7) is very convenient for undertaking 
numerical calculations. Various numerical and analytical techniques are available to 
solve the equations and hence obtain the values of the state variables at a succession 
of time instants, from the starting state and the inputs. We are not concerned here 
with the mathematical techniques that are used to solve the equations of state, and 
we shall not pursue the example further. Table 2.1 below lists the state variables, the 
input and output variables and the coefficients for this simplified model.

CHAPTER THREE  
Engineering Planning and Design 
 
Planning, design and management are the core activities used to drive an 
engineering project from its inception through to a successful conclusion. These 
are essentially problem-solving processes. In this chapter we first look at a simple, 
common-sense method for solving open-ended problems that provides us with a 
methodology for undertaking engineering planning and design. The main steps in 
the processes of planning and design are discussed in some detail. Some important 
related considerations are also mentioned, including safety and risk, the role of 
codes and regulations, and legal and social issues. Alternative, non-traditional 
approaches to engineering work are also discussed, including the agile approach 
and sprints and scrums. Wicked and intractable problems are discussed briefly. In 
an appendix, a planning example is discussed, which deals with the future water 
needs of a small coastal city. 
3.1 TERMINOLOGY  
As we have seen in previous chapters, the terms planning and design are not 
mutually exclusive, and there is overlap in the way both words are used. Broadly 
speaking, planning is undertaken to ensure that a proposed action will be 
successful. It involves deciding on the goal that is to be achieved by the action, and 
then identifying the steps needed to achieve the goal. These steps, when clearly 
formulated, constitute a plan. Planning is a crucial step in any engineering project. 
Design, as distinct from planning, is undertaken to produce the information needed 
to create a new physical system. Design work is also undertaken when an existing 
system is to be modified and improved. Management refers to the effective use of 
available resources to achieve a designated outcome. Management is the means by 
which the results of engineering planning and design are implemented and brought 
to a successful conclusion. 
In this book, we will refer to the design of physical objects, and to the 
planning of operations and processes, in short: to the design of hardware and the 
planning of software. Accordingly, we design a bridge, but plan the process of its 
construction. Design work is undertaken with the purpose of determining precise 
details of devices, machines, and other physical objects, so that they can be 
manufactured or constructed. Planning work is undertaken to determine the details 
of the procedures and processes which form part of any engineering project.  
These descriptions of planning, design and management can be sharpened if 
we apply the systems terminology of Chapter 2. An engineering project is thus 
undertaken to change the current state of some part of the physical infrastructure to 
a preferred new target state, either by introducing new systems and processes or by 
modifying existing ones. The planning for an engineering project begins with a -
study of the current state of the infrastructure and proceeds to the identification of 

58  
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
the desired future target state. It also involves working out the steps needed to 
change the present state into the new state. Design is the process of determining the 
details of any required new systems (or the details of modifications to be made to 
existing ones) that are needed to achieve the desired changes to the infrastructure. 
The purpose of management is to bring about the changes efficiently, in a 
designated time frame, and with an effective use of available resources.  
By way of example, consider a project that aims to improve the quality and 
quantity of water to be delivered to a township over the next 25 years. In the initial 
planning work, it is first necessary to determine details of the present water supply 
system, and in particular the quantity and quality of the water currently used 
together with details of the delivery systems. It is also necessary to evaluate the 
expected demographic changes in the city over the planning period, including 
increases in physical size and population, changes in business and industry 
activities, so that future water requirements can be estimated. Possible new sources 
of water may be required, such as groundwater and domestic rainwater tanks, and 
possible sites for new reservoirs and dams. Combinations of the various 
alternatives will also be considered. Additional options in the case of inadequate 
water sources may include recycling of water, the use of pricing policies to curb 
demand, and the construction of desalination plants if there is ample salt water 
close by. The progressive changes to the water supply system during the planning 
period, to allow for the increasing demands for water, will be an extremely 
important planning outcome. 
Design work for the project would be needed for any new components, or 
modifications to existing components. For example, if a new dam is to be 
constructed, design work is needed to determine the size, shape and other details of 
the dam wall, and how the wall is to be keyed into the valley sides and base at the 
chosen site. But before the design work can begin, it will be necessary to identify 
and survey possible sites and to obtain data on rainfall and runoff patterns, as well 
as relevant geological information. Careful planning is needed to determine the 
sequence of steps for preparing the site and constructing the dam wall. The 
resulting construction plan for the dam will include activities such as providing 
access roads to the site, bringing in heavy equipment, excavating soil and rock, 
shaping and preparing the foundations, grouting unsound regions of bed rock, and 
progressive construction of the main wall. Design work is also needed for the 
downstream components of the delivery system, such as pipes, pumping stations, 
holding tanks, and pressure tanks.  
Comparable planning and design work would be needed for any other options 
that are chosen. The planning and design activities themselves need careful 
management, as do all the steps in the implementation phase of the project. 
Progress needs to be monitored regularly to ensure that the design and planning 
work proceeds on time and within budget.  
The term project planning is applied to the overall planning of the project, 
while the planning undertaken at sub-project level is often referred to as activity 
planning. The planning required to carry out a particular step in an engineering 
project is thus activity planning. The planning of an activity results in a sub-plan, 
or component, of the project plan.  
Using an hierarchical view of planning, Griffis and Farr (2000) go further and 
use the term program planning for planning at a broader level where, for example, 

Engineering Planning and Design 
59 
 
various related engineering projects are identified and sequenced, taking account of 
available resources. Program planning thus takes place at the regional, state or 
national level. A program would include a number of projects that are to be carried 
out together or in sequence. A flood mitigation program in a fertile river valley 
might include the construction of several dams in the upper reaches, silt dredging 
near the river mouth and the building of levy banks in intermediate regions along 
the river.  
Although our focus here will be on project planning and activity planning, we 
need to mention several other types of engineering planning. Strategic planning is 
undertaken by businesses and other organisations to produce long-term plans that 
are aimed at their continued successful operation and survival. Another form of 
long-term planning, of interest particularly in situations where the future is 
uncertain, is scenario planning (Meier et al. 2016). As an example of scenario 
planning, NASA and ESA (the European Space Agency) have developed a joint 
experimental program to test whether the impact of a relatively small missile could 
nudge an asteroid out of a collision path with the earth (Cosmos Community Input, 
April 2017). According to Cosmos, a different approach is being studied by the 
Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau in Russia, which aims to design and construct a 
missile that could destroy asteroids if they come dangerously close to earth.  
The design activities in an engineering project can be broken down into tasks 
and sub-tasks. This breakdown is needed to deal with the complexity inherent in a 
large infrastructure item such as a dam, a road, a bridge, a building or an airport. In 
the design of a unit that is to be manufactured in large numbers, such as a washing 
machine, a mobile telephone, or an automobile, the design is undertaken using the 
hierarchical approach. It is also used in the planning of processes, such as the 
manufacture and delivery of ready mixed concrete to building sites in a city. 
Planning and design are complex activities; so complex, usually, that they can 
only be carried out iteratively, with considerable trial and error. It will be 
appreciated that the activities of planning, design and management for a large 
project will be closely inter-related and will probably overlap. Basically, they are 
all problem-solving activities.  
3.2 DEALING WITH ILL-DEFINED AND OPEN-ENDED PROBLEMS 
In Chapter 1 we saw how engineering problems can be complex, open-ended and 
ill-defined. The systems approach was introduced in Chapter 2 to deal with 
complexity in engineering systems and in engineering problems, but it does not 
provide a means to solve open-ended problems. We now consider how best to deal 
with open-ended and ill-defined problems.  
An ill-defined problem is one that is vaguely or ambiguously formulated. 
There are good reasons why engineering problems are initially poorly defined. The 
need for an engineering project can gradually become evident over time as 
inadequacies in the infrastructure are experienced. Community dissatisfaction leads 
to demands for improvements. In such situations the needs of the community may 
be expressed forcefully, but not necessarily precisely and unambiguously. This is 
how some large engineering projects begin. The first step is to identify and clearly 
formulate the real problem. 
Even when an engineering problem has been clearly formulated and stated, it 

60  
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
will be open-ended, in the sense that there will not be a single âcorrectâ solution. 
Indeed, a characteristic of engineering problems is that there are alternative, 
potentially acceptable solutions. The problem is not to find âtheâ solution but 
rather to find the âbestâ solution. For example, road traffic congestion in a part of a 
city might be dealt with by increasing the capacity of the existing roads. An 
alternative could be to introduce an efficient and cheap public transport system. 
Some social engineering might also be considered, by modifying the starting and 
finishing times for employees of industries and businesses in the problem region.  
At the commencement of an engineering project, the initial state will not be 
known precisely and the target state is still undefined. In some situations it may be 
very difficult to identify the required target state and, in a worst case scenario, it 
will not be possible to know whether the correct engineering decisions have been 
made until the project has been completed. For example, the planning and design 
for a new and improved model of an automobile requires a great deal of expensive 
engineering work, and then manufacture, but the introduction of the new model is, 
in the end, a risky commercial venture. Its success can only be tested in the market 
place after the engineering work has been concluded. The open-ended nature of 
engineering work raises a number of important questions. In particular:  
 
ï· 
how do we solve an open-ended problem if there is not going to be a unique, 
correct solution? 
ï· 
how can we know if we have found a good solution to an open-ended 
problem? 
ï· 
how do we go about identifying alternative solutions to an open-ended 
problem?  
 
To find answers to such questions we need to look at problem-solving strategies.  
3.3 METHODOLOGY FOR SOLVING OPEN-ENDED PROBLEMS 
People use a range of problem-solving strategies in their everyday life. One 
popular procedure is to choose a method (or even a solution) that was successfully 
used in the past. This approach might work well in relatively simple situations, 
provided the problems, past and present, are identical, or very similar in nature. 
Difficulties will arise if there are substantial differences between the present and 
past problems.  
In engineering work, it can be useful to draw on past practice for ideas for 
solving current problems. However, it is dangerous to rely exclusively on this 
approach. Adaptation is always needed, because differences inevitably exist 
between past and present engineering problems, and great care must be exercised 
to ensure that these differences are allowed for. Furthermore, past practice is not 
relevant when a problem has new features. Often there is no relevant, reliable past 
practice to rely on and engineers must then create innovative, new approaches.  
Problem-solving strategy 
When faced with a problem that is both ill-defined and open-ended, common sense 
suggests that the first step should be to clarify the problem and re-state it in clear 

Engineering Planning and Design 
61 
 
and unambiguous terms, in so far as this is possible. If a range of alternative 
approaches can be found, after the problem has been clearly formulated, then the 
initial instinct may well be to choose the most âobviousâ one and develop this into 
a solution. The obvious or instinctively most acceptable solution is likely to be one 
that has been used previously and that we are therefore familiar with.  
 
On reflection, however, it becomes clear that intuition alone will not lead 
necessarily to the best, or even to a good, solution. Rather than concentrating 
initially on a particular solution, it is better to take just the opposite approach and 
look for as many different solutions as possible, that are feasible and promising. To 
be able to do this, we need to formulate the problem in general (not over-specific) 
terms so that unusual but promising solutions are not excluded. 
Our search for unusual but promising ideas will not be successful if we use 
convergent thinking and rely on an analytic approach. We need to use divergent, 
lateral thinking. Creativity is extremely important because we are seeking unusual, 
non-routine solutions. In Chapter 4 we shall look at the question of creativity and 
how creative approaches to problem solving can be developed.  
If we are successful in creating a range of different and promising solutions to 
our problem, our next task is to evaluate them, compare and rank them and hence 
identify the best approach. These simple thoughts lead to a problem-solving 
strategy which can be applied to poorly formulated, open-ended problems. The 
steps are listed in Table 3.1.

2 
 Develop a wide range of promising approaches for solving the problem 
3 
 Evaluate and compare these approaches and hence identify the best one 
4

5 
 Implement the solution 
Methodology for complex engineering problems 
The strategy of Table 3.1 will be appropriate for relatively simple, open-ended 
problems where it is easy to evaluate and compare the alternative options. This 
may be the case in simple activity planning tasks. If, however, the problem has 
many, relatively complex, alternative solutions (and this is typically the case in 
engineering work) then an enormous amount of effort would have to be expended 
in the third step. A full set of designs and plans would have to be created for each 
approach. This would be extremely time consuming, costly and inefficient, because 
it would mean solving the detailed problem many times, once for each option.  
For example, if we consider a harbour city and the problem of choosing the 
most suitable water crossing for the road traffic, there may be a dozen main 
options, including bridges of various types at different sites and under-harbour 
tunnels with alternative routes. Each bridge and tunnel option will be unique. If the 
problem solving strategy of Table 3.1 were applied unmodified, it would be 
necessary to carry out detailed designs for each option, in order to make proper and 
fair comparisons. The design and planning costs in engineering work are always 

62  
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
substantial and in this case they would be many times the cost of a single design, 
and prohibitive. The bill for the planning and design work alone would take up a 
large portion of the budget. 
 
 
Planning and design for the Great Pyramid of Giza 
 
Studies of the great pyramid of Khufu (or Cheops) have shown how complex and 
ingenious the planning, design and construction for this mammoth engineering 
undertaking must have been. The pyramid, located on the outskirts of present 
day Cairo in Egypt, was built more than four thousand years ago. It has a 230 m 
square base and covers an area of 5.3 hectares or 13 acres. Over 140 m high, it 
is the greatest monumental construction of antiquity. Apart from its special 
chambers, the pyramid originally consisted of three main components: a massive 
inner core of stone blocks, a thin surface cladding of white limestone, and an 
intermediate fill layer between the cladding and core. The surface cladding must 
have given the construction a spectacular appearance. It has been vandalised 
over the millennia. The main inner core contains over 2 million large stone blocks 
of limestone and granite, mostly weighing between 2 and 6 tonnes. These were 
sourced from various quarries, then sized and shaped before being transported 
by Nile barges to the site, where they were moved on rollers and raised to the 
working level (up to 140 m high) before being placed precisely in position. One 
theory suggests that a temporary inclined helical ramp was built around the 
partially completed pyramid and used to move the blocks up to the working level. 
It is estimated that the project was completed in a little more than twenty years 
by around 20,000 men working in small teams. 
Pyramid design was complex and ingenious. In earlier pyramids the stone 
blocks were given a slight inward inclination to improve stability and reduce 
settlement. The great pyramid was constructed on bedrock which had been 
cleared, levelled and shaped to give stability and prevent settlement. The blocks 
were placed in horizontal layers, generally with larger blocks at lower levels and 
with smaller blocks in the higher layers. Corbelled ceilings with granite beams 
were used for special rooms, and stress-relieving chambers were introduced 
above the burial chamber. 
 
The planning for the construction must have been of the highest order, 
comparable with that needed for a modern monumental engineering project. On 
average it was necessary to transport, deliver, raise and place about 300 blocks 
per day. With say a twenty-man team to look after each block, an average on-
site workforce of above 6000 would have been needed. However, it seems that 
the main building work took place during the yearly flooding of the Nile, when 
agricultural work could not be undertaken. The building site must have then been 
a hive of activity. Even looking after the needs of the workforce would have been 
a highly complex exercise in planning and logistics.  
The planning, design and management skills evident in the construction of 
the Khufu pyramid had been acquired by experience and trial and error over 
generations of pyramid building. The name of Imhotep, a vizier, medical doctor 
and scribe, is associated with pyramid design and construction, in particular the 
step pyramid of Saqqara. He is perhaps the first engineer to be known by name. 
The vizier responsible for the great pyramid is thought to have been Hemiunu.

A modification to the strategy in Table 3.1 is needed. The costs in time and 
effort in the planning and design phases can be reduced enormously if, instead of 
fully evaluating every option, we use an incremental approach, and start with 
simple and rough comparisons of the options. On the basis of quite limited 
information it will usually be possible to identify and eliminate the less 
competitive options. This first step is not costly because we are using simple, 
approximate, order-of-magnitude calculations. A second, rather more detailed, 
evaluation of the remaining options then allows a further cull to be made. 
Proceeding step-by-step in this way, with increasingly detailed calculations, we 
obtain a short list of the most promising approaches. For this strategy to work, we 
must have a range of models and analysis methods that vary from simple and 
rough, up to accurate (and presumably complex). We have already discussed 
modelling and analysis in Chapter 2, where we saw that a range of approaches of 
varying complexity, and therefore accuracy, can be developed in most engineering 
fields.  
Proceeding step-by-step in this way, we eventually identify a single best 
option. If not, we will at least have a short list of the most promising options and 
we can then proceed to a final round of comparisons in which we use the most 
accurate analyses and calculations.  
With this methodology we substantially reduce the total amount of effort. 
Furthermore, the more detailed calculations are made for the more promising 
options. The steps in this modified methodology are listed in Table 3.2.

6

 Implement the solution 
Iteration 
It might appear from the discussion so far that we only have to follow the linear 
sequence of steps in Table 3.2. This is not so. As the design and planning work 
proceeds, it will often become clear that a modification, improvement or correction 
is needed in one or more of the steps already completed. In Step 4, for example, 
when a new and unusual, but promising, approach is being evaluated, it might be 
found that the original problem statement in Step 1 is unnecessarily restrictive. 
Rather than staying rigorously with the original problem statement it is best to go 
back and restate the problem in a more encompassing way, as our aim is to obtain 
the best solution. Likewise, when alternatives are being compared and ranked in 
Steps 5 and 6, it might become clear that an improved problem statement will 
allow improvements to be made to some of the approaches.  

64  
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
Even in the final phase, when the short-listed alternatives are being ranked 
and ordered, it might be found that some approaches have been unnecessarily 
penalised or even eliminated because of arbitrary, unnecessarily restrictive criteria. 
A reformulation of Step 3 would then be justified if it can lead to a better solution 
to the problem. It might even be possible to modify some approaches in Step 6 to 
achieve more favourable evaluations and hence a better solution to the problem. 
Iteration is an essential ingredient in this methodology. 
In some situations it may be advantageous to undertake several steps 
simultaneously. If it is difficult to choose good evaluation criteria in Step 3, before 
the alternative approaches have been examined, it might be preferable to undertake 
Steps 3 and 4 simultaneously. A possible complication then to be avoided is 
unintentional bias in the choice of criteria that favours an intuitively appealing and 
favoured approach.  
We will now see how this methodology is applied to the processes of 
planning, and then design.  
3.4 ENGINEERING PLANNING  
A methodology for undertaking engineering planning is shown in Figure 3.1. It 
follows closely the problem-solving methodology listed in Table 3.2 but typical 
feedback loops have been added to emphasise the need for iteration.

There has also been a regrouping of the steps from Table 3.2 into five main phases, 
in order to conform with common engineering usage. Some new terminology has 
been introduced.  In particular, the step of choosing the evaluation criteria (Step 3 
in Table 3.2) has been combined with Step 1 to become the problem formulation 
phase. The feasibility study incorporates Steps 2 and 4, while preliminary planning 
consists of Steps 5 and 6. Step 7 has been renamed detailed planning.  
The overall aim of the initial problem formulation phase is to clarify and, if 
possible, quantify the problem. This is not as simple as it may at first appear 
because engineering problems are usually many faceted. For example, constraints

always apply to an engineering project, and limit in various ways the approaches 
that can be taken. Engineering projects are always constrained by limits on overall 
cost, on available time, and on the quantity of materials and human resources that 
are available. Account needs to be taken of these constraints in the initial problem 
formulation phase. 
The feasibility study is the second phase of the process in Figure 3.1. This 
term emphasises that there might not be a feasible solution. The desired outcome 
from this step is of course a short list of acceptable approaches, which will 
demonstrate feasibility. As already mentioned, the intention at this stage is not to 
focus on a specific approach, but to find as wide a range of different and 
contrasting feasible alternatives as possible.  
The preliminary comparison of alternatives commences during the feasibility 
study, after the range of options has been identified. This allows us to test out the 
evaluation criteria and to modify them as necessary. The feasibility study continues 
until we have a short list of good, feasible options. If no feasible approach can be 
found, then we must abort, postpone or modify the project. Reasons for not finding 
a feasible solution might be related to difficulties in satisfying the constraints that 
are imposed on the solution. For example, costs might be unexpectedly and 
unacceptably high for all alternatives. Sometimes the technology will not be 
sufficiently advanced to allow an economical and safe solution to be formulated. If 
no feasible solution is found, an option is to repeat the feasibility study, but with 
relaxed constraints and less optimistic goals. 
In the third phase of the process, preliminary planning, further rounds of 
comparisons and evaluations are carried out, in order to identify the best option. 
The comparisons now require more detailed analysis and evaluation than 
previously. If one of the alternatives stands out clearly from the others, then the 
preliminary planning phase can be quickly and easily completed. On the other 
hand, if the alternatives are closely matched, this phase can become protracted 
because of the need for increasingly detailed comparisons.  
The purpose of the detailed planning phase is to take the best option, when it 
has been identified, and develop it to work out all of the details  needed to 
undertake the implementation. If much analysis and evaluation work has already 
gone into identifying the best option, then there will be correspondingly less 
detailed planning work needed. The end result of this phase is a detailed plan for 
implementation. However, this might still not be the final plan. Problems can arise 
during implementation that make it necessary to revisit some of the earlier steps. 
Indeed, the plan will not be finalised until the project is completed. There is an 
often quoted statement: it is not the plan that is important, it is the planning.  
The last phase, implementation, may require the construction or manufacture  
of new components of infrastructure or the implementation of new processes. At 
first sight, implementation may seem to be a separate part of the project, to be 
undertaken when the planning and design work has been completed. This is not so. 
Whatever form the implementation takes, it is almost always necessary to return to 
and revise some of the earlier planning work.  
In later sections of this chapter we will discuss in some detail how to 
undertake each phase of the planning process. Before doing this, however, we will 
discuss the phases of the design process.

3.5 THE DESIGN PROCESS 
The design process shown below in Figure 3.2 parallels that in Figure 3.1 for 
planning, although there are some differences in terminology. In particular, the 
term concept design has been used to describe the second phase of the process, 
when alternative approaches are sought. The emphasis here is on finding 
alternative concepts, or design options, rather than on investigating feasibility. 
Despite this difference in wording, the aim of the second phase is the same in both 
design and planning: to produce a short list of the best feasible options for solving 
the problem. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3.2 The design process 
 
In the structural design of a bridge, the concept design phase is undertaken 
with the purpose of finding suitable alternative structural forms that provide safe 
âload pathsâ for the design loads. The load paths carry the applied loads, such as 
self-weight, vehicular loads and wind loads, through the different structural 
components and into the supporting foundations. For a large-span bridge, the 
alternative structural forms might include an arch, a suspension bridge, a cable-
stayed bridge and a multiple span system of beams with intermediate piers.  
Initially, the aim is to produce a wide range of alternative, promising 
concepts, but then to reduce these down to a short list, using the evaluation criteria 
developed in the problem formulation phase, using simplified calculations and 
approximate models and analyses. 
The most general, far-reaching and financially most important design 
decisions are made in the initial stages of the concept design, when new, original 
and unusual approaches are sought. As the design proceeds towards the detailed 
phase, the design decisions become more and more specific, and they have less 
impact on overall costs.  
In Figure 3.2, the terms preliminary design and detailed design correspond to 
their counterparts in Figure 3.1. The purposes of these phases are similar in both 
planning and design and, as we shall see, they are carried out in the same way. The

purpose of the preliminary design phase is to study the short-listed concepts in 
sufficient detail to allow the best concept to be identified. If it is difficult to choose 
from several very good concepts, then successive rounds of calculations and 
comparisons of increasing complexity are needed. These studies may become, in 
effect, detailed designs. It is not unusual for the preliminary design phase to blend 
into the detailed design phase, with detailed designs being carried out for several of 
the very best options.  
In the design of a dam for a water supply system that was planned for the 
Hastings district in New South Wales, Australia, 24 sites were identified in an 
initial study. During preliminary design this was narrowed to two, before the best 
was chosen for the final design (Thompson, 2005). 
In the detailed design phase, the aim is to take the best approach, now 
identified, and generate all the information needed to allow full implementation. If 
one concept has been clearly identified at an early stage as the best, then a fair 
amount of additional, detailed work will be required in this phase. On the other 
hand, the effort needed in the detailed design is correspondingly reduced when the 
chosen concept has already been investigated in some detail.  
As previously noted, reconsideration of previous phases of the design may 
become necessary when implementation is underway. Poor engineering design will 
almost always be the result if inadequate attention is paid to how the design is to be 
constructed or manufactured or otherwise implemented. 
Although Figure 3.2 adequately represents the engineering design process, 
some designers prefer to describe the process slightly differently. The term 
preliminary design is sometimes preferred to concept design. It is also not unusual 
to treat problem formulation as a part of concept design. The design process could 
then be described as a three-phase sequence consisting of concept (or preliminary) 
design, detailed design, and implementation. 
Irrespective of the way the design process is described, the activities of 
problem formulation, concept design and preliminary design (in the sense 
explained above) are the basic steps. We have chosen here to describe design in 
terms of the five phases of Figure 3.2. There are two reasons for this: firstly, the 
importance of problem formulation in design is highlighted; secondly, this 
formulation emphasises the close similarities between the processes of planning 
and design.  
What is not shown in Figure 3.2 is how the need for design work is often first 
recognised during the project planning process. This is when the need for a new 
physical system might first be identified. Initially the need is not formulated very 
clearly or precisely, so that problem formulation remains an important step to be 
undertaken at the commencement of the design process. The following statement 
by Richard Seymour, and quoted by Liston (2003), emphasises the crucial role of 
problem formulation in engineering design: 
 
Something which is often forgotten or misunderstood is that the vast majority 
of the work involved in design is finding out what the problem really isâ and 
itâs rarely what you think it is. More often than not the client is asking the 
wrong question. Once youâve found out what the problem really is, then things 
virtually design themselves because youâve so comprehensively understood the 
problem that the solution is self-evident.

Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
3.6 COMMUNITY INPUT  
Large engineering projects are designed to improve the physical infrastructure, and 
the community as a whole are beneficiaries. Nevertheless, a minority of people can 
be seriously disadvantaged by even the most successful projects. For example, 
when upgrades are made to access roads into a city, land acquisition can disrupt the 
lives of people who live and work in the affected areas. In such circumstances, 
financial compensation can become an important part of the process. 
People have the right to know about proposed new developments that will 
impact on their lives, and they also have the right to express opinions and concerns 
about such developments, and indeed to take part in the decision making processes. 
In many countries, freedom of information laws ensure that information is 
available to the community on proposed new engineering projects. When large-
scale engineering work is to be undertaken, the sectors of the community that are 
likely to be affected need to be advised and brought into the process, not only 
through written information but also via public meetings and consultations. The 
views of individuals and groups in the community need to be known during the 
initial planning phases of the project and also as work progresses.  
Differing views are normal in any group of people. Alternative and opposing 
views can arise in regard to an engineering project, and will usually be 
accomodated in the community consultation process. A compromise view is often 
reached which is acceptable to, if not welcomed by, all participants. Unfortunately, 
this is not always the case. Occasionally, opposing or competing community views 
of a proposed engineering project can become entrenched, that seem not to be 
resolvable. The term intractable has been applied to such situations, and the 
associated problems have been referred to as wicked. These are rare, but do occur, 
and are discussed in some detail in Section 3.14 below. 
3.7 PROBLEM FORMULATION PHASE IN PLANNING AND DESIGN 
Table 3.3 below contains a checklist of actions that can assist in the problem-
formulation phase of engineering planning and design. The terminology used 
comes from Chapters 1 and 2. Some of the actions are information-gathering 
activities while others are aimed at formulating and, to the extent possible at this 
stage, quantifying the problem. Consultation with the community and its 
representatives will often be required. Although intended specifically for planning 
and design, these actions can be useful in problem solving generally. We now 
discuss them in turn. 
Identifying the problem as part of a wider problem 
As we have already seen, an engineering project can begin as a response to 
perceived needs in the community, and the objectives may be initially poorly 
defined. The problem as stated may be too vague; alternatively, the problem may 
be stated in over-precise terms which imply an âobviousâ solution. In the latter 
case, the implied solution will rarely be the only possible one, and may not be the 
best one. It is therefore important to begin the problem formulation phase by trying 
to identify the problem as part of a wider or larger problem.

By way of example, we return to the problem of providing traffic access 
between two parts of a city separated by a waterway. Suppose that the cross traffic 
is already catered for by several bridges which cannot handle the increased traffic 
volumes. The âobviousâ problem might be seen as providing an additional bridge 
to cater for present and future traffic. Is this a statement of the problem, or is it 
statement of a solution to a problem? A broader problem statement would be: how 
to improve the cross-harbour traffic flow. An advantage of this statement is that it 
widens the range of possible solutions. It is now possible to consider a tunnel, a 
range of small peripheral bridges, various forms of water transport, or even air 
traffic as alternatives. This example was used by Noel Svensson in his book on 
engineering design in 1974. 
In fact, the city of Sydney has been faced with a traffic problem of this nature 
for many years. In the 1950s there was a single bridge to carry traffic across the 
harbour between the northern and southern suburbs. A second bridge was 
constructed on the periphery of the harbour at Gladesville, but traffic volumes 
continued to grow and traffic congestion became worse. There were community 
calls for another large harbour bridge. The next step was in fact to construct a 
tunnel to address the cross-harbour traffic problems in the medium term. The 
tunnel, integrated into the arterial roads of the city, was initially successful. 
However, as the city continues to grow so too do the problems of traffic 
congestion. New solutions are needed. 
It is useful to further widen our example. Is the real problem simply one of 
regularly increasing the traffic capacity on all the main routes in response to 
growing volumes? A broader problem statement might be to reduce or eliminate 
the current and future traffic congestion. This statement allows more varied 
approaches to be considered. It allows, for example, a reduction in peak traffic by 
staggering starting and finishing times for various industries, and the use of 
flexitime in offices. It also encompasses initiatives such as imposing surcharges on 
traffic that uses critical facilities at peak times, and encouraging the increased use 
of public transport. A form of congestion tax has been introduced in cities such as 
Singapore and London to limit the number of vehicles entering the inner city area.  

70  
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
Broadening the problem statement does not disallow the initial âobviousâ 
solution. On the contrary, it opens up the problem to a range of alternative, 
competing solutions and so tests the adequacy of the âobviousâ solution. 
Identifying each engineering system as a component of a wider system 
To assist in identifying the problem as part of a wider problem, it can be useful to 
identify the relevant engineering system as a component of a larger or wider 
system. In the above example the broader problem statements have focused on the 
transport system, of which a bridge is just one possible component. 
It can be useful to take the problem-broadening technique further. In the 
above example, is the problem purely one of achieving an efficient city transport 
system? The costs involved in providing roads, tunnels and bridges to improve the 
traffic network of a large and sprawling city run into many billions of dollars. 
When such expensive traffic options are considered, other radically different 
possibilities deserve consideration. It might be possible to achieve a more 
workable city by reducing the need for cross-harbour traffic. Here we are 
extending our discussion beyond traffic engineering and into the realm of town 
planning. We can go further: is it the best use of resources to improve road 
transport in an already congested city? Even if the road transport system were to be 
improved, the result is likely to be more city growth, followed by further 
congestion and yet more calls for improvements to the again-inadequate transport 
system. An alternative and better use of the resources might be to introduce 
decentralisation schemes and encourage the relocation of industry and population 
away from the city, into regional growth areas. We have now moved on from town 
planning questions to a consideration of regional planning and various associated 
political issues. 
Identifying interest boundaries for the problem 
How far should the process of problem broadening be taken? Clearly we could 
extend the bridge argument further, beyond regional planning and into areas of 
national or even international planning. At some stage the problem broadening 
argument breaks down. How do we recognise this stage? The questions cease to be 
relevant when they are so broad that new issues will barely influence the problem 
statement. This occurs when the expanded system is so large that the original 
problem (in this case, the need for a bridge, or some alternative) ceases to be 
relevant. When this happens, we have clearly gone too far. 
The limit, where the problem has been widened to the extent that the original 
problem is of marginal relevance, is referred to as the interest boundary for the 
problem. The relevant solution options will be found within this boundary. In 
Figure 3.3 the interest boundary is shown for the bridge example previously 
discussed. In this case the very large costs indicate that the interest boundary 
should certainly include the city system and perhaps extend to the surrounding 
region or even state. 
The construction of a large bridge in a small country can become an 
international issue. An example was the K-B Bridge in Palau, a small island nation 
in the Western Pacific, somewhat less than a thousand kilometres west of the 
Philippines. The bridge was constructed in the 1970s with aid money from the 

Engineering Planning and Design 
71 
 
United States when Palau was its protectorate. At the time, the bridge was the 
largest prestressed concrete box-girder cantilever arch construction in the world, 
linking the two main islands of Korror and Babeldaob. It served a crucial purpose 
for the whole population of Palau because essential services, including the airport 
and power generation equipment, were located on one island while most of the 
population lived on the other. The bridge collapsed suddenly and apparently 
without warning in July 1996, shortly after it had undergone extensive 
refurbishment. Life in Palau was severely disrupted, even though a ferry 
connection was established between the islands. The construction of a new bridge 
was clearly beyond the resources of Palau and had to wait until it could be 
undertaken with international aid. The interest boundary in this case extended well 
beyond national boundaries.

As another example of an interest boundary, we noe choose a relatively small 
one, but again in the field of traffic engineering. We consider the redesign of a 
hazardous traffic intersection in a suburban area.  
The traffic intersection may initially be seen as a part of the local traffic 
system, consisting of the intersection and the immediately adjoining streets. This 
can in turn be regarded as part of the traffic system in one region of the city. The 
interest boundary is indicated in Figure 3.4. In this case the costs of the proposed 
project are a small proportion of the annual road transport budget. Conditions at 
the traffic intersection are of only marginal relevance in relation to the efficient 
flow of traffic through other regions of the city. 
In summary, the problem-broadening process should be halted when a further 
widening of the boundary has only a marginal impact on the original problem 
statement. The interest boundary can be identified in this way. 
Determining the real underlying needs as distinct from the stated needs 
The real needs that initiate an engineering project are not always those that are 
initially perceived. The process of problem widening and the identification of the 
engineering system as a component in a wider system usually lead to a better 
understanding of the real needs. In the bridge example, the need is not for a bridge 
per se, but for a reduction in traffic congestion, or, possibly, a more efficiently 
functioning city. When the needs are properly identified the problem can be 
formulated in a more general and much more useful way. 
In situations where the size and scope and influence of a project are limited, it 
may be much easier to identify the relevant underlying needs. As an example, 
consider the construction of a swimming pool as part of a house design for a 
private client. Before the design work is undertaken the real needs of the client 
have to be clarified. The pool may be needed for swimming training, for diving, for 
exercise, or for social entertaining and relaxation. It might be required mainly for 
prestige reasons, or for a combination of reasons. In each case a different design 
could be appropriate. The problem statement should be formulated through 
sensitive discussions with the client. 
The attempt to identify underlying needs sometimes moves attention away 
from purely technical problems towards social issues and political problems, 
especially when the proposed work is large in magnitude and costly. This is almost 
inevitable if large sums of public money are to be spent. As the problem-widening 
and system-widening processes are undertaken, the questions acquire an 
increasingly political and social flavour and require community input. 
Gathering relevant background information 
When work commences on a new project there is usually a lack of relevant 
background information. This has to be gathered as early as possible, and before 
the problem formulation phase is completed. The required information may be 
scientific and technological, but it may also be non-technical and sociological, 
legal or political in nature. The data-gathering exercise may require consultation 
with the community, the use of libraries, the internet, textbooks, and databases. 
Sometimes it will be necessary to gather field data and conduct laboratory tests, as 
for example when the properties of a foundation material have to be determined. 

Engineering Planning and Design 
73 
 
The type of information needed in engineering work is unlimited. When 
international one-day cricket matches were initially planned in Australia, a lack of 
suitable turf wickets was an important problem and the design of replaceable, 
transportable turf wickets was investigated. In this case the necessary background 
information included the way the game of cricket is played as well as the laws that 
govern the game. Detailed horticultural information was needed on the appropriate 
types of grass for preparing turf wickets, how to grow the grass, and the depth of 
soil needed, not only to allow the grass to grow but also to provide the right 
âbounceâ. Other information was needed on how to achieve the best type of 
drainage and compaction, and the required wearing properties of the turf. The 
structural engineering questions, relating to creating a rigid, transportable structural 
tray to support the pitch, seem relatively uncomplicated. In unusual projects, 
engineers will rarely have adequate knowledge or training in the relevant specialist 
fields. It is necessary to gather information rapidly and may require working in 
association with consultants and other professionals with specialised knowledge. 
As a further example, consider the relocation of arterial roads in a suburban 
area. There is an obvious need for technical information concerning the soil 
properties along the proposed routes as well as the present and expected future 
traffic volumes. To obtain this information programs of soil testing and traffic 
counting might be undertaken. Other relevant background information of a quite 
different nature relates to the social structure of the community through which the 
roads are to pass, for example the location of the roads in relation to natural 
community boundaries, including the catchment areas for local schools. The 
political implications of such a project, measured in terms of votes gained and lost, 
may also turn out to be important background information, influencing any 
political decisions on whether or not the project proceeds. 
Searching for side effects 
Each engineering project is designed to bring about some change in the world in 
which we live. Although the intention is to improve the infrastructure and thereby 
satisfy some community and individual needs, it is inevitable that there will be side 
effects. These may be obvious and desirable, but also hidden and undesirable. They 
may only become evident after a considerable period of time, when the project has 
been completed and is in operation. In the case of a large-scale project there will 
usually be a wide range of side effects, some beneficial and some detrimental.  
The identification of side effects should begin as early as possible during 
problem formulation but should continue into the evaluation stages because some 
side effects will depend on the chosen solution. It is clearly important that the 
relevant side effects be identified and allowed for when the costs and effectiveness 
of each alternative approach is evaluated. 
Some disturbance of the environment may be inevitable when a large 
infrastructure project is undertaken, and environmental side effects can become a 
focus of community attention. If a road or freeway is constructed, either in an 
urban or rural development, some modification of the surroundings is involved, 
such as the demolition of existing older buildings. It may involve cutting into a 
hillside or filling in part of a valley floor in the countryside. Even when a large-
span bridge is constructed across a valley to lessen the physical effects on the 

74  
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
environment of the roadway, there is a visual impact. Of course the impact may be 
pleasing to many, but a serious problem to others.  
 
 
 
A side effect of improved car security 
 
In a report in the Australian Newspaper of 5th June, 2006, a rise in the number of 
âcar jackingsâ was attributed by police to improved âimmobilisation technologyâ. 
The new technology had made the theft of unattended late model vehicles 
almost impossible. According to the newspaper report, thieves had therefore 
taken to âholding up drivers across Sydneyâs wealthy suburbsâ.  
 
 
 
In 2011, work commenced on a high road bridge to cross the valley of the 
Mosel river in Germany. The main purpose of the bridge was to improve links 
between the city of Frankfurt and Dutch and Belgian harbours. However, as 
reported by Asimov (2010), the project became controversial, and serious 
opposition developed, when adverse side effects on the wine industry and tourism 
in the region were identified.  
Technical side effects may be advantageous or disadvantageous for a project. 
The provision of lift wells and associated walls in a multi-storey building design 
improve the resistance of the building to lateral loads. Non-technical side effects 
can become significant, such as increased or decreased job opportunities, which 
may be temporary or long lasting. The influence on the tourist industry of the 
construction of a monumental, iconic building, or the development of water sports 
and recreation facilities following the construction of a dam, are examples of non-
technical side effects which may have an effect on the outcome of a project. They 
need to be identified and spelt out in the problem formulation phase. 
Identifying constraints 
It is important in the problem formulation phase to identify the constraints that 
apply to the problem. Constraints restrict the possible solutions to a problem, and 
arise in various ways. They may be technical, legal, economic, social, 
environmental or political in nature. Monetary cost is a constraint that applies in 
one way or another to every engineering project. Constraints arise if certain side 
effects are unacceptable or undesirable, such as excessive atmospheric pollution. 
Technological limitations create other constraints. 
Legal constraints apply, for example, to building construction. They limit the 
maximum footprint size of a building on a city building site and also the maximum 
building height. Other examples of legal constraints are the emission control 
requirements for automobile engines and the minimum requirements for fire 
protection and toilet facilities in buildings that house people. 
Legally enforceable industry standards are often the means by which 
constraints arise in engineering design. Limits for noise control and thermal 
insulation thus apply in the design and construction of apartment buildings. Design 
constraints may be introduced for the different components that make up a system 
so that they fit together and work in harmony with each other. Constraints can 

Engineering Planning and Design 
75 
 
sometimes be quantified as physical limits or as minimum performance 
requirements which must be achieved.  
 
 
Identifying Constraints: Power supply for Waterfall Gully 
 
As already noted in the main text, much of South Australiaâs power is carried on 
the distinctive steel and concrete Stobie poles. However, there are situations 
where these cannot be used. In the late 1970s the increasing demands for 
electricity in Adelaideâs eastern suburbs led the state electricity body, the 
Electricity Trust of South Australia (ETSA), to investigate the provision of 
additional capacity to suburbs adjoining the Adelaide Hills. This required 66kV 
power lines to traverse difficult terrain over a number of hills.  
Various constraints were identified in relation to the location and nature of 
the proposed work, such as: 
 
Cost and visual appeal: although underground power lines would have been 
preferable from a visual point of view, the cost of this solution had recently 
increased significantly and essentially ruled out underground lines as an option. 
Legal: planning approval was required from the Department of Environment and 
Planning and this led to further constraints on what could be installed. 
Environmental: the Department of Environment and Planning imposed 
constraints in terms of visual amenity and the physical environment, including 
limiting the scope of roads that might be used to access the area. 
Social: although the residents of nearby councils were the beneficiaries of the 
new power supply, they exerted significant social and political pressure on the 
planners in an effort to maintain their views and the natural characteristics of the 
area. 
Technical: without the ability to drive roads and tracks through the area a 
solution had to be developed using available technology. The solution was built 
around the use of a helicopter. This had technical constraints associated with it, 
because there was a limit to the load that could be lifted, in this case a spare 
carrying capacity of less than 140kg. 
 
The constraints that were imposed left few viable options. The one that was 
chosen was to build and partially assemble three steel structures. The 
components were to be brought to the site by helicopter and bolted together 
while secured by guy ropes.  
Difficulties encountered in assembling the pylons, coupled with other 
issues, led to the deaths of four workmen who were on one of the structures 
when it suddenly fell to the ground during an operation designed at securing it in 
alignment. Three died instantly and the fourth was pronounced dead on arrival at 
the Royal Adelaide Hospital.

The unavailability of certain resources can lead to other constraints. For 
example, telephone poles were commonly made of wooden tree stems in most 
parts of Australia in the mid-20th century. However, the lack of trees in country 
South Australia severely constrained the use of timber and led to the early and 
widespread use of a steel-concrete composite pole, called a Stobie pole after its 

76  
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
designer. Stobie poles have been a distinguishing feature of the South Australian 
landscape for many decades. 
Another important constraint is time. Completion deadlines are crucial 
constraints in the construction of sporting complexes and facilities to be used every 
four years for the Olympic Games. The timelines for construction are determined 
by the set dates of the games and have to be met, in one way or another.  
Physical constraints apply to some engineering problems. In the early stages 
of the design of the Gateway Bridge in Brisbane, Australia, a minimum clear 
height above water level at mid span was required in order to allow shipping to 
pass under the bridge. On the other hand, a maximum overall height limit was 
imposed to give air clearance for flight paths to the nearby airport. The initial 
constraints on minimum and maximum heights clashed for this bridge and no 
solution was possible until the constraints were examined more closely and 
relaxed.  
In the case of large engineering projects with overt government support, it is 
not unusual to find that political considerations lead to explicit or implicit 
constraints on the engineering work. Local sourcing of materials and the creation 
of employment are frequently negotiated before any engineering work is 
undertaken and become constraints on the engineering work. Such constraints have 
to be identified early in the problem clarification phase of the project. 
Defining objectives and identifying conflicts among objectives 
It is important to have a clear and unambiguous statement of the goals and 
objectives of any engineering project. This is, in effect, a statement of the problem, 
and of what is to be achieved. While it is important to clarify the initial problem 
statement, it can be advantageous not to finalise it until at least some of the 
background information has been collected. In particular the process of identifying 
relevant systems as components of larger systems and identifying the problem as 
part of a larger problem can assist in identifying the objectives. 
Furthermore, engineering projects usually do not have just one, but rather a 
number of different objectives, and some objectives are very likely to conflict with 
others. The twin requirements of maximum performance and minimum cost are 
always going to be in conflict. It is always necessary to identify potential conflicts 
among the objectives. 
For example, a dam can usually be used both to store water for supplying to a 
township or region and to assist in reducing down-stream flooding. Some dams are 
also designed for electricity generation. For effective storage, the dam should be 
kept nearly full, whereas for flood prevention it needs to be nearly empty and able 
to accept runoff after heavy rain. The operating policy for the dam has to recognise 
and allow for the implied conflicts. 
Potential conflicts among objectives must be explicitly recognised. The 
question of how to deal with conflicting objectives will be discussed in some detail 
in Chapter 9. 
Specifying design criteria, performance requirements and operating conditions 
The goals and objectives of a project are expanded, clarified and quantified 
through the use of design criteria. Performance requirements and operating 

Engineering Planning and Design

conditions are used jointly to specify how the system that is to be created must 
perform. These are used both in the detailed phases of planning and design, and in 
the preliminary phases to evaluate and rank alternative approaches and concepts.  
In the creation of a physical system or device it is necessary to determine both 
the conditions under which it will operate and the level of performance that will be 
required. For example, if a pipeline is to be used to move natural gas from a 
production field to a consumption site, the performance requirements for the 
system will include the maximum and average quantities of gas that will be 
transported in a time period, as well as the minimum life of the operation. Such 
information is also needed for the planning and design of other components of the 
overall system, such as storage tanks and pumps.  
The operating conditions of interest in the pipeline might include the variation 
in ambient temperatures throughout the year, the magnitudes of possible seismic 
action, and the chemical properties of the gas in relation to its effect on the pipe 
material. 
Clear and unambiguous statements of goals, objectives, design criteria and 
performance requirements are particularly important should the completed project 
or system not reach expectations, with resulting legal dispute. 
Safety and reliability are further performance requirements which require very 
careful consideration. They are discussed briefly in Section 3.13 following, and in 
more detail in Chapter 11. 
Devising measures of effectiveness 
The goals and objectives of a project are expanded, clarified and quantified 
through the measures of effectiveness, which are used in the feasibility study phase 
of project planning and in the preliminary and the detailed design phases. When a 
project has more than one objective, one or more measures of effectiveness are 
needed for each specific objective, and ideally with an overall measure that takes 
account of the different objectives.  
Total cost is often appropriate as the overall measure of effectiveness. This is 
the case if the various objectives can be stated in terms of equivalent cost. Overall 
cost is also appropriate if the various objectives can be reformulated as minimum 
performance requirements, or as constraints that have to be satisfied. Not all 
situations lend themselves to monetary evaluation. For example, the measures of 
effectiveness might need to take account of matters such as aesthetics, 
environmental effects, risk of injury and loss of life. 
Even when cost is used as the measure of effectiveness, conditions can 
become complex if carefully analysed. In the replacement of the superstructure of a 
bridge, total initial cost might at first appear to be entirely appropriate, so that it 
would be a simple matter to choose, say, from construction based on steel trusses, 
steel plate girders, in-situ reinforced concrete girders and precast, prestressed 
concrete girders. Purely in terms of cost of construction the plate web girder 
solution may be a clear winner. However, when maintenance costs are taken into 
account for the expected lifetime of the bridge, which may be between 50 and 100 
years, the reinforced concrete girder solution may take precedence. But other 
factors might also influence the decision, such as the need for minimum disruption 
to traffic during construction. The problem is now to establish a time-cost trade-

78  
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
off. This might lead to the choice of a prefabricated truss system. Yet again, if 
appearance is important, as well as cost and time needed for construction, an 
extremely difficult trade-off has to be made between monetary value and 
appearance. The precast, prestressed concrete solution may now be competitive. 
The manner in which the measures of effectiveness are formulated can be 
enormously influential in determining the direction that a project will take. In some 
circumstances an engineering project might be undertaken without the explicit use 
of a measure of effectiveness. For example, a design engineer might choose a 
design approach subjectively without a study of alternatives and a measure of 
effectiveness. If the project is small, the argument could be that an exhaustive 
problem formulation study would only add to the cost of the project. There are 
inherent dangers in such an approach, and they should be evident from the 
discussions to date. One possibility is that the wrong problem is solved. Errors of 
judgement easily occur if there is no measure of effectiveness. Even an attempt to 
define a measure of effectiveness can provide a fresh starting point, because it 
gives new insight into the project. 
Iterating 
The various activities listed in Table 3.3 all occur within the problem formulation 
phase; nevertheless, they may need to be undertaken iteratively. The type of 
background information that is required becomes progressively clearer after some 
attempt has been made to identify side effects and constraints and possible 
approaches. Likewise, some of the constraints and side effects are more easily 
recognised after some background information has been gathered. It will also be 
necessary to return to the problem formulation phase as we proceed through the 
later phases of planning and design. 
3.8 FEASIBILITY STUDY AND CONCEPT DESIGN 
The purpose of the feasibility study in planning is to show that the project can be 
carried out successfully. When a short list of promising alternative approaches has 
been identified, any one could form the basis of a solution. Likewise, the aim of 
the concept design phase is to establish a short list of promising concepts, each of 
which may result in a successful engineering design.  
It is emphasised that it is best to begin with a wide a range of alternatives. We 
have seen how each option can be investigated superficially in order to cull non-
feasible and non-competitive candidates. A further study, with a somewhat more 
detailed analysis of each option, leads to a further culling. The culling continues, 
using additional information, until there is a short list of feasible, promising 
options. A list of steps that can be useful in the feasibility study and in concept 
design is shown in Table 3.4. The steps are discussed below.

 Modify the measures of effectiveness as necessary 
 Scrap or defer the project if no feasible approaches can be found

Checking available resources 
Resources are used up in the course of an engineering project and an initial check 
is needed to ensure that sufficient resources will in fact be available. Resource 
availability (or non-availability) can determine the viability of particular options, 
so that this check should be undertaken with all alternative concepts and 
approaches in mind.  
It is necessary to consider human, financial and technical resources, as well as 
any special materials and machinery that will be needed during implementation. 
Engineering expertise and scientific knowledge are resources, as are relevant trade 
and craft skills. Specialised design and analysis skills may be required. Time is a 
resource because engineering work always has to be completed within a limited 
time frame. 
Investigating and quantifying the constraints 
The technical and other constraints that have been identified in the problem 
formulation phase have to be investigated and, if possible, quantified. Some 
constraints are legal-technical, and are quantified in codes and standards and in 
legislation. In the design of a large city building, constraints on overall height, 
minimum services for water, sewerage, fire protection, thermal and acoustic 
insulation and even vertical transport, are imposed through the relevant ordinances 
and building acts.  
Developing as many promising concepts as possible 
This is the key step in the entire processes of engineering planning, design and 
problem solving. The success of any design or planning work depends on the 
range, quality and appropriateness of the approaches and options that are 
generated. As already emphasised, diversity in the alternatives is important. 
Innovative and creative new approaches, as well as traditional and proven ones, 
should be included in the initial list of alternatives. It is by no means clear whether 
an innovative new approach or a well-tried standard approach will eventually 
prove to be best. Both types need to be investigated. 

80  
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
The technique of problem-widening, described previously, should prevent an 
overly specific problem statement that would otherwise stifle new and unusual 
approaches. Creativity is central to this activity and is discussed further in Chapter 
4, together with techniques that may prove helpful in the search for new and 
different options.  
Comparing alternative concepts and progressively eliminating non-competitive 
approaches 
The preliminary comparison of the options, made using simple calculations and 
preliminary information,  will allow the poorer options to be culled. In the design 
of a highway bridge to cross a river, rough order-of-magnitude design calculations 
are sufficient to provide very approximate sizes for the main structural components 
of alternative systems. This allows preliminary costs to be estimated and for checks 
that the constraints and operating conditions are met. Information on costing is 
provided in Chapter 8. 
In further rounds of comparisons, the increased accuracy of the analysis and 
design calculations lead to more refined comparisons and further culls.  
Modifying the problem formulation as necessary 
The need for an iterative approach throughout the problem solving process has 
been emphasised. Modification of the original problem statement may be needed 
during the feasibility study. As work proceeds and new and unusual approaches are 
considered and investigated, the understanding of the problem is inevitably 
improved, so that a better formulation of the problem may be possible. New and 
unexpected approaches can challenge the validity of the original problem 
statement, particularly in regard to the measures of effectiveness that are used to 
compare and evaluate the alternatives.  
Scrapping or deferring the project if no feasible approaches can be found 
If none of the options are feasible, perhaps because they do not satisfy constraints 
relating to time, cost or resources, then the project cannot proceed. It might be best 
to cancel the project, or to defer it until technical knowledge has improved to the 
level needed, or until additional resources become available. Another possibility is 
to look for new, innovative approaches that will make the project feasible. Yet 
another possibility is to reformulate the problem with different, more modest goals 
and less severe constraints.  
3.9 PRELIMINARY PLANNING AND DESIGN 
The purpose in this phase is to bring the search for the best option to a positive 
conclusion and to identify the approach that will lead to the best solution of the 
problem. Each short-listed option is investigated in turn and in sufficient detail to 
allow comparisons and rankings to be made, using the measures of effectiveness.  
Even at this stage, very accurate comparisons are avoided if at all possible 
because of the cost implications. On the other hand, if alternatives are eliminated 
on insufficient grounds, the most appropriate alternative might also be incorrectly 

Engineering Planning and Design 
81 
 
eliminated. The step-by-step approach therefore continues until all but one of the 
alternatives are eliminated. 
Although attention is focused on the original options that emerged from the 
feasibility study, the search for new and better alternatives should not be 
discontinued. Modifications to existing approaches should be made in the later 
stages of the process if improvements are achieved. As work proceeds, there can be 
a build up in expertise which can lead, even at this stage, to further improvements 
and changes to the original problem statement and to the measures of effectiveness, 
as well as to new or modified design or planning concepts. 
3.10 DETAILED PLANNING AND DESIGN 
The aim now is to work out the details of the solution that are needed for full 
implementation. For example, at the end of the preliminary design of a reinforced 
concrete bridge the form of construction and the approximate overall dimensions 
of the component members will have been chosen. It is now necessary to fix the 
details, including final member sizes, the amount, type and location of the 
reinforcement in each member, non-structural fitments, concrete strength, concrete 
finishes, special road surfaces, handrails, bearing pads to support any main girders, 
and storm water pipes, so that full construction plans and specifications can be 
prepared. 
Accurate calculations are needed in the detailed phase. But even here, 
iteration may become necessary, for example to develop alternative trial details for 
some components. If adjustments are made to the design details, with the aim of 
improving performance or decreasing cost, a new analysis might be needed to 
check whether the improvements have in fact been achieved. Such iterations 
continue until an effective and economical design or plan has been achieved, that 
meets all the requirements. 
It is in the detailed phase of planning and design that optimisation techniques 
may be employed. If the behaviour of a component lends itself to theoretical 
modelling, it should be possible to improve the design by mathematically 
optimising the parameters that define or characterise the component. The process 
of optimisation is discussed in some detail in Chapter 13, together with various 
mathematical optimisation techniques. 
At all stages of the detailed design, checks are made that the design 
constraints are not violated. In some situations overly severe constraints may add 
disproportionately to the cost or detract from the effectiveness of a solution. Even 
during the detailed planning and design phase it may be advisable to modify 
decisions made previously in the problem formulation phase.  
In the detailed design of the components of a system, the primary focus 
should be on the overall operation and cost of the parent system. If the design of a 
component has a disproportionate effect on overall cost and effectiveness, then 
modifications may be possible for this component and for the interacting 
components, so that an improved overall design is achieved. If components are to 
be manufactured in quantity it may be desirable, depending on the nature and 
expected cost of the component and the number to be produced, to construct 
prototypes and test and modify them as an adjunct, or alternative, to the theoretical 
analyses. 

82  
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
The important final step in the detailed design and planning phase is full 
documentation, with a permanent record of relevant calculations and analyses and 
any other investigations that have been used to produce the final plan or design. 
3.11 IMPLEMENTATION 
Implementation of a plan, a design or a solution to an engineering problem can 
take many forms, depending on the context of the work. Special engineering fields 
with their own undergraduate programs and text books are devoted to the different 
types of implementation, such as construction engineering and manufacturing 
engineering.  
Poor engineering design occurs when inadequate consideration is given to 
how the design is to be implemented. Constructability is an important criterion that 
is too often forgotten in the structural design of buildings. An undue focus on 
optimum design can lead to an elegant design with a minimum use of materials, 
but exorbitant construction costs. 
We have specifically mentioned (if only briefly) the implementation phase 
here as a reminder of its importance in the overall scheme of planning and design. 
3.12 THE SOLUTION-FIRST STRATEGY  
The sequence of steps shown in Figures 3.1 and 3.2 follows from the methodology 
for solving open-ended problems. The necessity of iteration, and the advantages of 
sometimes undertaking several steps simultaneously, have been mentioned.  
 
In some situations a rearrangement of the sequence shown in Figure 3.1 or 
3.2 may be advantageous. It can be argued, for example, that choosing the 
evaluation criteria before the range of alternative approaches has been identified 
can prove to be an overly analytic approach. An alternative is to choose the 
evaluation criteria after some or all of the options have been identified. This may 
sometimes be a better alternative, although it may also introduce an unintentional 
bias in the criteria that favours some approaches over others. A better alternative 
might be to undertake these activities simultaneously. Various rearrangements of 
the sequence are possible and desirable in special circumstances. 
To emphasise the fact that alternative sequences may be appropriate in some 
circumstances, we now discuss briefly a solution-first strategy. This stands in sharp 
contrast to the sequence in Figures 3.1 and 3.2. Numerous examples can be found 
in the history of engineering where an important project has not commenced with 
the identification of a problem but, on the contrary, has started with a potential 
solution. The task is then to search for an appropriate problem. A good technical 
idea may arise from some technical or scientific development, or by bringing new, 
potentially useful knowledge from another field of engineering.

Post-it NotesÂ® (the adhesive that wouldnât stick) 
 
The development of the Post-it note pads is a good example of the application of 
the solution-first strategy. In 1968 a 3M scientist, Dr Spence Silver, discovered a 
new type of adhesive, one that was quite different from anything currently 
available but whose properties defied conventional use. Dr Silver tried for five 
years to generate some interest in the new product, but because it was 
apparently inferior to existing adhesives he was unsuccessful. 
 
Eventually a company researcher, Art Fry, took notice of the adhesive 
and its properties and started using it as a bookmark. The advantage here was 
that it was sticky enough not to fall out, but not so sticky that it left a residue on 
the page. By using the adhesive in this way it was soon noticed by others around 
the 3M Company and the idea of a lightly adhesive note pad soon developed. 
 
The Post-itÂ® note was introduced commercially in 1980 and named 
outstanding new product by 3M in 1981.

The solution-first approach shown in Figure 3.5 applies to such situations. A 
specific solution is the starting point to the procedure, which is a rearrangement of 
Figure 3.2, the steps being similar to those already discussed. This again 
emphasises the important point that engineering problem solving is an iterative 
activity. The entry point to the process is not of prime importance.  
 
In a similar vein, Rogers (1983) has argued that answers often precede 
questions. He has suggested that while organisations face many problems, they 
typically possess only limited knowledge of a few innovations that can offer 
solutions. The chance of identifying an innovation to cope with a specific problem 
is therefore small. However, by commencing with an innovative solution there is a 
good chance that it can be matched to some problem facing the organisation. 
According to Rogers, a strategy for organisations is thus to scan for innovations 
and to try to line up a promising innovation with relevant problems. 
3.13 OTHER ASPECTS OF PLANNING AND DESIGN 
Risk, safety and failure  
Once the goals and objectives of an engineering project have been established, the 
expectation is that they will in fact be achieved. However, engineering work 
inevitably involves some uncertainty and risk, and the possibility always exists that 
a system or a component will not perform as expected, or indeed that the entire 
project will not fulfil all of its objectives. When any engineering work is 
undertaken there is a risk of failure that, although small, is real and unavoidable. 
However, the levels of risk are controllable to some extent, and can be reduced to 
very small values that are acceptable to the community.  
 
It is important to note that the term âfailureâ can mean different things to 
different people, and within the context of engineering work, it can be used with 
different meanings in different contexts. By way of example, consider the design 
and construction of levee banks as part of a flood mitigation scheme in a river 
valley. For the general public, and especially for people living in the valley, the 
word failure would be used in the event that the floodwaters overtop the levee 
banks and flow onto the adjacent land. In this sense, the word failure refers to a 
temporary condition, from which the system can recover. Indeed, the designers 
would have considered the risk of the flood event and the levee banks would have 
been constructed to resist the physical forces that occur during flooding, so that 
they will remain viable after the flood waters have receded. 
 
However, in the design of the levee banks the engineers face several 
problems. Firstly, the maximum rainfall event that will occur over the design life 
of the project is unknown, and no upper bound can be placed on it. A second 
problem facing the designers is that the financial and physical resources available 
for the project will be limited. It is not therefore feasible to create a system that 
will contain all flood levels, irrespective of the intensity of the rainfall. Given these 
limitations, the task of the design engineer is not to create a system that will never 
âfailâ in the sense that the floodwaters will overtop the banks, but rather to create a 
system that will successfully accommodate large rainfall events âmost of the timeâ. 
The realistic design aim is therefore for the levee banks to prevent flooding, except 
for the extremely large rainfall events that will occur about once in every thirty 

Engineering Planning and Design 
85 
 
years (or perhaps fifty years or even a hundred years, depending on the resources 
available and the resulting damage from overtopping). In one sense the system fails 
whenever the banks are overtopped, as we have seen, but from the design 
engineerâs point of view the levee banks will be a success provided they reduce the 
frequency of flooding to an acceptably low frequency, of about once in every thirty 
(or so) years. For the designer, failure occurs if the levees are overtopped more 
frequently than once in thirty years on the average. In this example, the term 
âfailureâ has two quite different meanings, both of which are legitimate.  
 
From the designerâs point of view, a practical and useful engineering 
approach is to say that failure occurs if the performance of the system does not 
meet the performance levels that were set for it. These performance levels are 
carefully chosen during the design process when the minimum performance 
requirements, the design criteria and the effectiveness measures are identified. 
Nevertheless, in the previous example the system must be designed so that it can 
recover from flooding. We could also say that the system suffers a temporary 
failure during each flooding. In this text, and especially in Chapter 11 (which deals 
with risk and reliability), both meanings of the word failure will be used, but the 
meaning will be made clear from the context. 
 
In regard to an engineering project, we can say that failure occurs if the aims 
and objectives of the project are not substantially achieved. Another quite different 
kind of engineering failure can occur if unintended, unpredicted and unacceptable 
side effects arise from the engineering work. Such failures can arise from errors 
made in the initial investigation stages of the project and from an incomplete and 
inadequate understanding of the problem. 
 
Irrespective of the way we choose to define failure, there can be many 
different possible forms, or âmodesâ, of failure to consider. Furthermore, the 
consequences of the different failure modes can vary enormously. The 
consequences may be very minor, such as when a pump in a water treatment plant 
breaks down, or they may be catastrophic, as in the collapse of a dam with loss of 
property, injury and even loss of life. Minor engineering failures are not 
uncommon, but the catastrophic ones, such as the collapse of a building, a bridge 
or a dam, are fortunately very rare.  
Turning to an example from the field of structural engineering, we note that 
many different modes of failure are possible in critical cross-sections of a 
reinforced-concrete girder in a building frame. These include failures in flexure, 
shear, torsion, tension and compression, and various combinations. There are other 
possible modes of failure of the entire member to consider, such as excessive 
deflection. The many different failure modes have very different consequences, 
varying from severe (a torsion failure followed by a partial building collapse) 
through to minor operational disruption (excessive deflection under a temporary 
overload).  
 In any project, the designer must identify the possible modes of failure, 
evaluate the likely consequences of each mode, and design the system so that there 
is an acceptably low risk of failure appropriate for each mode. The level of risk 
that is acceptable will depend on the mode of failure and on the consequences of 
the failure.  
There are many possible causes of engineering failure, ranging from human 
error and poor material quality, through to catastrophic natural events, such as 

86  
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
severe earthquake or extreme flood. Human error can occur by miscalculations 
made in the design phase of the project, or by errors made during the 
implementation phase, or by mismanagement or accident during the operational 
phase.  
The cause of a catastrophic failure may even be a very unlikely event that has 
been foreseen and allowed for in the planning and design phases. In the original 
design of the Tasman Bridge in Hobart, Australia, careful consideration was given 
to the possibility of a ship colliding with the main piers. Although this was 
considered to be a remote possibility, steps were taken in the design to limit the 
effect of such a collision (New et al, 1967). Nevertheless, the unlikely event 
occurred in January 1975, when a ship did collide with a pier of the bridge. The 
collapse of the main bridge deck had catastrophic consequences, with tragic injury, 
the loss of twelve lives and severe disruption to life in Hobart (Laurie, 2007). 
It is not uncommon for the actual use of resources during the implementation 
phase of a project to be greater than was allowed for in the planning phase. Also, 
engineering projects are not always completed within the planned time schedule. 
Such over-runs on cost and time may be due to errors made in the planning, the 
design or the implementation phases of the project. They may be caused by supply 
chain problems, or even by extreme weather conditions. The over-runs may be 
small or large, but, strictly speaking, these are failures in the sense that we are 
using the word.  
In open-cut mining projects a great deal of planning effort goes into 
minimising and managing risk, but it is accepted that accidents are unavoidable. 
Rescue and recovery operations are therefore included in the planning, design and 
on-going management of such projects. In petroleum and crude-oil handling 
facilities, all procedures are carefully planned and monitored with the express 
purpose of preventing fire and explosion. Accident, fire and explosion cannot be 
prevented completely, and have to be allowed for in the planning and design of 
such projects. Management procedures are carefully worked out to handle 
accidents when they occur, in order to minimise the consequences. 
Even with the introduction of ingenious fail-safe concepts, the probability of 
failure in real engineering systems cannot be reduced to zero. The incremental cost 
of reducing risk increases sharply as the risk level decreases. In other words, it is 
extremely expensive to achieve a marginal increase in safety when the safety level 
is already high. Eventually a stage is reached in any design situation where the cost 
of improved safety is impossibly high. Engineering design must therefore deal with 
calculated risk and, in rare cases, the prospect of malfunction and failure.  
Given that an element of risk is inevitable in engineering work, one of the 
difficult decisions is what is an acceptable risk level to be applied in planning and 
design. If the risk is too high and the safety requirements too low, the rates of 
occurrence of failure will be unacceptable to the community. If the risk levels are 
set too low, the cost of achieving the safety levels becomes unrealistic. A 
consequence of extremely low risk levels and high project costs is that fewer 
important projects can be undertaken. Methods for risk management and for 
dealing with failure always have to be analysed in detail. They are discussed 
further in Chapter 11.  
While engineers understand that absolute safety is not an achievable or a 
feasible objective, this is not always appreciated in the community, or in legal 

Engineering Planning and Design 
87 
 
circles. The risk levels adopted in engineering work have an indirect effect on the 
entire community, in regard both to the safety levels achieved and to the cost of the 
engineering infrastructure. It is for this reason that national codes and standards 
provide guidance and set minimum safety and performance requirements in many 
fields of engineering.  
3.14 INTRACTABLE PROBLEMS AND SYSTEMS  
The procedures for planning and design that we have discussed so far in this 
chapter make use of systems concepts that were introduced in Chapter 2. In effect, 
they provide a common-sense approach to the solution of complex problems which 
are ill-defined and open-ended.  
Are all engineering problems amenable to this common-sense (and 
traditional) systems approach? Do all engineering systems lend themselves to 
decomposition and analysis?  
It has been observed that some real world problems are too ill-structured to be 
dealt with using the standard systems approach. These have been described as 
wicked problems, as distinct from the docile problems that are amenable to 
standard approaches (Rittel and Weber, 1993). Wicked problems usually have a 
strong human dimension, for example when a number of individuals and groups of 
people are closely involved, both in the problem itself and in defining and finding 
an acceptable solution.  
It has also been suggested that some real world systems do not lend 
themselves to standard planning and design techniques. A distinction has been 
drawn between hard systems, for which the procedures described in this book are 
applicable, and soft systems, which are intractable. Soft systems have been 
described as highly complex, lacking any clear structure, and possibly containing 
uncoordinated sub-systems that pursue their own independent goals. Again, such 
problem systems usually have a human dimension. A soft systems methodology has 
been developed by Checkland (1984) and his co-workers at the University of 
Lancaster for dealing with complex, intractable problems that are related to soft 
systems. It has also been suggested that the self-contained, limited, engineering 
project may not be the best way to deal with soft systems, and that alternative 
approaches may be more successful.  
Wicked problems 
Wicked problems have been discussed since the 1970s in regard to social planning 
and management problems that involve human activity, and more recently in 
regard to engineering planning, design and management. As already discussed in 
Section 3.6, there is an important human element in most modern engineering 
work, and community consultation and community input normally lead to 
acceptable decisions and successful outcomes.  On the rare occasions when this is 
not the case, problems can become wicked, and this is usually because conflicting 
views and opinions in the community. According to Rittel and Weber (1993), 
wicked problems cannot be adequately formulated because additional relevant 
aspects are continually brought up for consideration. They suggest that a solution 
only occurs when a decision is made that the current trial solution is âgood 

88  
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
enoughâ. It follows that there is no correct or best solution to a wicked problem, 
only that alternative solutions can be identified, compared and ranked. They also 
consider that each wicked problem will be unique, and that each wicked problem 
will lead to another problem.  
Perhaps inevitably, sub-classifications of wicked problems have been 
proposed: super-wicked problems have been defined as wicked problems which 
have serious time constraints imposed on them, and which are partly caused by the 
same people that are dealing with the problem. The term âmessâ was introduced by 
Ackhoff (1974) to describe a set of inter-related problems, or a system of 
problems. Further information on wicked problems and social messes can be found 
in the book by Ritchey (2011). 
Various strategies have been proposed for dealing with wicked and intractable 
problems. When a problem is made intractable by the involvement of many 
paticipants with opposing views, an authorative approach may be possible. A 
small group of carefully chosen people, including experts, is given the 
responsibility of coming up with a solution. This approach is time-efficient 
because it sidesteps the need to deal in detail with the competing views and beliefs 
of the interested parties; however, it relies on the perspectives and experience of 
the group of people chosen to deal with the problem. An entirely different 
approach is to invite solutions from all persons and parties involved with the 
problem, and then to evaluate them and identify the best one. This is an 
adversarial approach. It can lead to tensions in the community and mutual distrust. 
A compromise approach has also been proposed, whereby an attempt is made to 
include all people who are likely to be affected, and to achieve collaboration using 
meetings and discussions to clarify the issues among competing interests. This 
approach will be very time consuming, but can lead to a solution that will be 
satisfactory to the majority of people, optimal for a few, and unsatisfactory for a 
minority. Compensation is always an added option for dealing with those 
significantly disadvantaged by a project. 
In important engineering projects it is certainly true that very large numbers of 
people become involved, in one way or another. When different interested groups 
hold entrenched views, the project can take on a political dimension so that the 
engineering problems display the characteristics of wicked problems. Community 
consultations and negotiations then become very important, but may require 
additional political input.  
Some commercial engineering problems can be exceedingly costly and can 
only be evaluated as successes or failures after they have been completed. 
Examples are to be found in the design, manufacture and marketing of new 
innovative appliances, and even of new models of automobiles and aeroplanes. In 
this respect the planning and design problems have the characteristics of wicked 
problems, although the normal procedures of planning and design and open-ended 
problem solving are applicable. 
In previous generations, an authoritative approach was commonly taken to 
large engineering projects undertaken for the public benefit. A small group of 
politicians, engineers and other professionals were responsible for the decisions 
that affected the lives of many people.  
Today, large, important and controversial engineering projects receive 
continuing public scrutiny, beginning at the initial stages of problem formulation. 

Engineering Planning and Design

Public opinion and comment are openly sought. This does not mean that the 
engineering methodology is not used. Rather, it means that the relevant phases of 
the planning and design processes can receive useful input from the public, and 
that the community will be well-informed and can become involved in the decision 
making processes. Nevertheless, on rare occasions agreement might not be 
reached, perhaps due to opposing, entrenched opinions, and political input may 
then become necessary. There is a growing literature on wicked and super-wicked 
problems on the internet which makes for interesting and useful reading. 
Soft systems methodology 
Checkland (1984) and his research group at Lancaster University in the United 
Kingdom, and other researchers, drew a distinction between hard systems and soft 
systems. Hard systems are relatively well-defined and lend themselves to 
traditional evaluation and analysis using the procedures presented in this book. In 
contrast, soft systems are ill defined and possibly indefinable because individuals  
and groups of people with differing views become involved and do not agree on 
what constitutes the system and the purpose of the system, nor on the problem that 
is to be solved. The idea of soft systems was originally developed in regard to 
problems in management and business, but is applicable to some engineering 
problems, particularly those which involve opposing views with political and 
sociological elements.  
The soft system methodology proposed by Checkland and further developed 
by other writers is usually presented as a seven-step process. It is a sociological 
process rather than an engineering process, and is aimed at achieving accord 
among people and groups with radically differing views. Further details of the soft 
systems methodology can be obtained from a variety of internet sources. 
When an engineering problem is intertwined with sociological and political 
issues, the standard systems concepts and planning and design methodologies can 
become unworkable in the face of divergent and opposing philosophical and 
political views in the community. In such situations sociological and political input 
is needed to allow a basic starting point to be found for developing an engineering 
solution.  
Agile software development 
If engineering problems and systems become intractable, it is usually because there 
are social, political and business issues to be resolved. But this is not always the 
case. Developers of large, complex, computer software packages have found that 
traditional planning and design approaches are inappropriate because of the 
extreme complexity of the systems being developed, and the length of time needed 
to create the complete, final plan or program, and then bring it into operation. 
Multi-purpose, multi-faceted software packages are quite different to, say, a piece 
of engineering hardware, such as a bridge, which must be brought into use as a 
complete entity. In contrast, various parts of a large software package can be 
developed, delivered and put into use long before the complete package has been 
conceived, let alone created. Some business software packages fall into this 
category. In their final form, these packages gather enormous amounts of data that 
fluctuate second by second; they then process, evaluate and analyse the data and so 
provide rapidly changing advice concerning the financial markets.  

90  
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
An alternative, agile approach to software development has become popular, 
which allows solutions to evolve progressively and adaptively, with different teams 
working simultaneously on coding diverse parts of the package. The emphasis is 
on the early production of working software and the regular delivery of additional 
components. Close collaboration among the teams of developers is obviously 
necessary. However, the approach also encourages close contact between the 
developers and the end users of the package. Furthermore, it allows changes to be 
made to the overall requirements and function of the package, even at late stages of 
development. This is an adaptive approach in which, initially, there is no accurate 
statement of the requirements of the end product. On the contrary, the requirements 
can change and develop over time and as the detailed work progresses.  
 This is a radical departure from the traditional methodology in which 
implementation begins as the detailed planning and design come to an end. Some 
proponents of the agile approach have emphasised that they are not promoting a 
different methodology, but rather the principles of a different approach.  
The origins of agile thinking in software development can be traced back to 
the latter decades of the 20th Century, but the approach gained real momentum at 
the beginning of the new century, when varying views on agile principles (and 
even including a manifesto) were presented on the internet and published 
(Highsmith et al 2001). Generally speaking, the agile approach incorporates the 
following ideas: 
 
ï· 
customer satisfaction is to be achieved by the early and frequent delivery of 
useful software; 
ï· 
working software is the main measure of progress; 
ï· 
adaptability is paramount, allowing requirements to change, even in the late 
stages of a project; 
ï· 
close co-operation is needed, not only among the teams developing different 
parts of the software package, but also between users and developers; and 
ï· 
teamwork and good communication are essential among the self-organising 
development teams that progressively produce the architecture and overall 
requirements. 
 
In summary, the agile approach emphasises an adaptive, iterative and 
evolutionary approach to software development, rather than the traditional 
sequential approach of plan-design-implement.  
Not surprisingly, many procedures have been used in implementing the agile 
approach. We will consider just one, called scrum, which is used to manage the 
work of a software development team. The aim is quick delivery of software, with 
an ability to respond rapidly to changes in requirements, to emerging technologies, 
and to changing user requirements (Schwaber and Beedle, 2002). The word 
âscrumâ comes from the game of rugby football. In the scrum approach, a small 
team works closely together to produce new software components on a continuing, 
regular basis. Various roles are allocated to the team members. There is a product 
owner, who represents the interests of the customer or end user, but is also 
responsible for communication. The scrum master is the facilitator. A small team, 
usually of three to nine people, undertakes the development of software 
increments. 

Engineering Planning and Design 
91 
 
Work is undertaken in short sprints which typically last just several weeks, 
the aim being to produce useable software by the end of each sprint. A planning 
meeting is held at the start of the sprint to clarify the aims and the detailed work to 
be undertaken. A short stand-up meeting is held daily during the sprint and this is 
called a scrum. Each team member reports on progress made since the previous 
scrum, on the proposed work for the coming day, and, importantly, on any 
impediments that have been encountered.  
Further detailed information on the scrum method, and on other agile 
methods, are to be found on the internet. Of course, problems have inevitably been 
experienced in the introduction of the agile approach, some of which have been 
documented. One recurring difficulty is accurate budgeting for an agile based 
project.  
Agile management methods in engineering 
It has been suggested that agile methods may be useful outside of software 
development and in engineering management and business management. The agile 
approach has been proposed for use in the automated development of engineering 
products such as computers, motor vehicles and medical devices. A suggested 
advantage of the agile approach in management is that it is much easier to deal 
with change and with unexpected occurrences when work is organised in short 
sprints. It is too early to judge how successful agile methods will prove to be in 
traditional engineering management applications. New engineering applications of 
the agile approach will be followed with interest.  
 A potential problem in applying the agile approach, and one not to be 
underestimated, is how to achieve a smooth and successful changeover from one 
mode of operation to another. Even when significant advantages are to be found in 
employing an agile approach, a too-rapid change in the management approach 
would cause disruption in any organisation. Careful planning for the changeover 
would be essential. A useful approach might be a step-by-step âhybridâ alternative, 
in which some suitable parts of the project are chosen and managed using agile 
principles. Components of both approaches could in fact be cherry-picked to obtain 
advantages from both approaches 
3.15 SUMMARY 
Large engineering projects require extensive planning and design work that is 
mainly carried out prior to the implementation phase. A major part of this chapter 
is devoted to describing and explaining procedures that are suitable for undertaking 
engineering planning and design. These procedures are based on a common-sense 
methodology of open-ended problem solving. 
 
The processes of planning and design have many features in common, and in 
practice the terms are not mutually exclusive. However, we have used the term 
design when a physical object (or hardware item) is to be created, and the term 
planning when a non-physical object such as an operation or a process (or software 
item) is to be created. Despite this distinction, the processes are very similar, and 
we have emphasised the similarities in Sections 3.4 and 3.5 of this chapter, where 
the procedures for planning and design arew discussed.  

92  
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
 
The traditional plan-design-implement approach to engineering work is well 
suited to large and small engineering projects which deliver new items of 
infrastructure, or improvements to the existing infrastructure. Even when an 
engineering project is widely approved and leads to improvements in the physical 
infrastructure that will be enjoyed by the community as a whole, there are usually 
individuals and organisations that will be seriously disadvantaged. Financial 
compensation is a means of achieving equity in such situations. 
 
Individuals and organisations in the community can become stakeholders 
when they take a keen interest in an engineering project, and can become active 
participants in the decision making processes. Public consultation is a normal part 
of modern engineering planning and design, and can be beneficial to all. The 
outcomes from public participation can be very positive, provided time and 
resources are allocated appropriately.  
 
In some circumstances, however, problems can arise in the consultation 
process, especially if there are differing and entrenched views in the community. 
Sociological and political issues can then become intertwined in the engineering 
work. The consultation process may then end in controversy, without easy 
resolution. The terms wicked and intractable have been applied to such situations. 
When they arise, the plan-design-build approach may require political and/or social 
intervention. Wicked and intractable problems are relatively rare, but techniques 
for dealing with them are needed, and are discussed in Section 3.14. 
There are some engineering problems for which the traditional approaches, 
described in this chapter, do not work satisfactorily, even when there are no social 
and political issues. Computer software development is a prime example. The agile 
approach has been developed specifically for the management of software 
development work, and various procedures, including scrum and sprint, have been 
developed and are now used to apply agile principles. There is potential for the use 
of these alternative approaches in traditional engineering planning and design, but 
substantial applications are still to come.

APPENDIX 3A: PLANNING FOR A CITY WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM 
As an example of how the steps listed above in Tables 3.3 and 3.4 are used in the 
early phases of a project, we now discuss briefly the planning of the future water 
supply for a small coastal city in a very dry climate for, say, a 30 year period. The 
city of Adelaide in South Australia is the focus for the discussion. The aim here is 
not to provide valid, long-term conclusions in regard to the needs of this city. The 

Engineering Planning and Design 
95 
 
emphasis is on the process, not the results. We will restrict our attention to the 
problem formulation step and the feasibility study. 
Problem formulation 
The steps in problem formulation, listed in Table 3.3, are applied (in hindsight) to 
the planning of the water supply system for the problem as it was in the year 2010 . 
Identifying the problem as part of a wider problem 
Given that there is already a serious lack of water throughout the region, the 
problem of planning for the future water supply in Adelaide has to be considered 
as part of the wider problem of providing water for the entire State of South 
Australia. Although about 70 per cent of all economic activity in South Australia 
occurs in Adelaide, an attempt to look at the Adelaide water supply problem 
without reference to the water supply problems of neighbouring areas, including 
industrial cities such as Port Augusta and Port Pirie, the South Australian wine 
industry and other rural industries, would be a serious mistake. The fluctuating 
demand for water in remote regions of the state, generated by extractive industries 
and mining operations, is also relevant and needs to be taken into account. 
The geography of southern Australia and its lack of river systems makes it 
necessary to identify the problem as part of a wider problem: the management and 
use of water throughout the Murray-Darling river basin, which extends through 
three states in the eastern region of the Australian continent. This basin supplies 
the majority of the water used in South Australia, but there is significant upstream 
use of Murray water before the river enters South Australia, and this restricts the 
amount of water available. 
The apparent change in climate that has occurred in recent years in the region 
(but also in many other parts of the world) suggests that there might be global 
aspects to this âlocalâ problem.  
The water supply system for the city also has to be looked at as one among 
many system components that make up the physical infrastructure of the city. 
Other components of particular relevance are the sewerage and storm water 
systems, which have to take up most of the input water, but are also potential 
suppliers of additional (processed, recycled) water. The parks and gardens and 
other public areas place significant demand on water. The transport system and the 
energy generation and supply systems are other components of the city system, as 
are industrial regions and the suburbs where people live. 
Relevant background information 
Quantitative data on the current state of the water supply system and its desired 
future states in thirty years time and in intermediate times need to be gathered. The 
population of Adelaide was a little over a million in 2010, when the water supply 
system provided about 200,000 ML per year. In addition, a little under 100,000 
ML was used in neighbouring rural areas including the Adelaide Hills. On the 
demand side, about 45 per cent of city water was used by suburban households, 
about 28 per cent went to primary production, but only 10 per cent went to the 
commercial and industry sectors. Community use (including parks and gardens) 
made up the remainder, about 17 per cent.  

96  
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
Looking specifically at households, we find that about 40 per cent of domestic 
water went into gardens and other outdoor uses, such as swimming pools. 
Bathrooms (baths and showers) took up 20 per cent, with toilets at about 11 per 
cent, while laundries and kitchens use around 16 and 11 per cent, respectively. 
On the supply side we find that although the water for the city comes from a 
variety of sources, in 2010 the two main ones were, firstly, the reservoirs and 
catchment areas in the Adelaide Hills, and, secondly, water pumped from the River 
Murray. Other minor sources of water for Adelaide include groundwater, rainwater 
tanks and storm water. In a ânormalâ year the two main sources provided roughly 
60 and 35 per cent respectively of the water for the city and surrounding rural areas, 
but in âdryâ years, such as 2007 and 2008, the component from the Adelaide Hills 
reduced to between 10 and 20 per cent. The additional water was obtained by extra 
pumping from the Murray, and severe restrictions were placed on the outdoor use of 
water.  
These figures give a broad picture of the supply and demand situation in and 
around the city in 2010. Similar figures for the rest of the state, and indeed for 
south-eastern Australia provide additional important background information. For 
example, of the water available from the River Murray, about ten per cent went to 
towns and cities, while the rest was used in irrigation. Throughout the state there 
were about 50 small desalination plants in 2010, usually located in small and 
isolated regions such as Penneshaw on Kangaroo Island. 
Background information is needed on the desired âtargetâ state of the system 
in thirty years time, and at intermediate times. Such information regarding future 
demand necessarily depends on expected demographic changes to the city and 
state, and cannot be as reliable as the data on the current state. It could therefore 
be advantageous to look at several alternative scenarios, including optimistic, 
pessimistic and most likely, in order to obtain a range of figures for the target 
state.  
The future population of Adelaide has been estimated to be about 2 million by 
the year 2027, and 2.5 million by 2050. The document âWaterproofing Adelaideâ, 
prepared by the Government of South Australia, suggests a demand of about 
230,000 ML in the city in 2025. This unexpectedly low value may include some 
allowance for a curb on demand as the result of future pricing policies. Even so, it 
is worrying when compared with the predicted supply figures for 2025 from 
present sources, which are about 190,000 ML in a dry year and 250,000 ML in a 
normal year. One reason for the relatively low supply figures is the reasonable 
assumption that climate change will continue and will, for example, reduce the 
available water from the Adelaide Hills by at least ten per cent. 
It is clearly important to look for possible new sources of water in the 
feasibility study. Given the unavailability of new, plentiful and cheap sources of 
water in the surrounding hills, wider possibilities have to be considered. In 
anticipation of the steps in the feasibility study, we can see that background 
information will be useful on processes such as water desalination and recycling of 
used water, as well as methods for improving the efficiency of use of the existing 
sources of supply. Approximate (order-of-magnitude) information would be useful 
on more radical options such as the transport of icebergs (or iceberg water) from 
the adjacent Antarctic Ocean and measures to modify the location and quantity of 
rainfall. Another option requiring more accurate background information is the 

Engineering Planning and Design 
97 
 
possibility of adjusting water usage in the south east of the country, perhaps 
through the marketing and trading of water and water rights. 
Other relevant background information relates to the quality requirements of 
water when used in different ways. Clearly the quality of water needed for drinking 
and cooking is not the same as for irrigating public parks and gardens or for 
flushing toilets.  
Regular updating of information 
Predictions into the distant future for water supply are necessarily unreliable, 
concerning extremes of weather and other natural phenomena, are necessarily 
unreliable, but in the long term, extremes will undoubtedly occur in rainfall on 
catchment areas and flow in the River Murray. Procedures could be used to 
anticipate extreme events, including sensitivity studies and Monte Carlo 
simulation, but real data in the intervening years will be far more valuable than 
theoretical predictions. It is therefore essential that important data be gathered 
progressively so that the program can be revisited and updated regularly, perhaps 
every year or every two years. This updating must begin immediately and continue 
while the project is underway, and also after it has been completed, so that 
modifications can be introduced in a timely manner and at minimum cost.  
It must also be remembered that planning is not being undertaken solely for 
the supply of water at some remote future time. Adelaide is a functioning city and 
requires an ongoing plan to provide adequate water throughout the intervening 
years up to the target year of 2050.  
Underlying needs 
While a useful picture of future domestic, industry and rural water needs can be 
built up for the planning period, the severe lack of water raises important questions 
that highlight the differences between needs and requirements. Specifically, 
considering the relatively high domestic use of water, with 40 per cent going to 
gardens and other outside applications, an important question is whether a 
distinction needs to be made between the quality and cost of water when used for 
different purposes. Such questions arise when we look at the underlying needs, as 
distinct from demands, for water. This leads to the further question of whether 
water of varying quality should be supplied with pricing policies related to cost of 
supply. At present, almost all water is supplied at the one quality level. The issue 
of water trading focuses attention on the difference between needs and demands. 
Such questions are relevant when we undertake the feasibility study. Our purpose 
here is not to try to answer such questions, but to illustrate the process.  
An important step in the planning process could well be to place relevant 
questions before the community for discussion and debate. Already in the year 
2006 in various country communities in Australia questions were being examined, 
such as the acceptability of recycling water as a way to boost the capacity of town 
water supplies. 
Side effects 
Increasing pollution of the waterways in the Adelaide Hills and pollution and 
salinity problems in the River Murray are already prevalent. Worsening pollution 

98  
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
is an obvious side effect to be expected in the present project. The side effects of 
depleting ground water through aquifer pumping are not well appreciated in the 
community, but require investigation. Increased salt in the aquifer water and 
overall deterioration of quality could become serious side effects should there be a 
significant increase in the use of ground water supplies. Over-use of river water 
generally means reduced flow, with adverse effects such as silting, algae blooms 
and other adverse environmental effects on the biota. Cessation of river flow and 
closure of the river mouth is likely. Closure has already occurred at the Murray 
mouth, and the local community is well aware of the consequences.  
Other side effects include increased salinity in the river water of the Murray 
due to increased pumping, and the need for correspondingly more expensive 
treatment procedures to achieve adequate water quality. Another consideration is 
the inhibiting feedback effect of poor quality water on industrial expansion, city 
development and the rural and wine industries.  
Constraints 
Constraints derive from state and federal regulations regarding water quality, 
environmental impact, land resumption, health regulations, city planning and 
zoning, and water use. World Health Organisation standards for water quality and 
health also serve as constraints. Current intrastate agreements on the allocation of 
water from the Murray-Darling basin impose severe constraints on the available 
options for the city of Adelaide. In this regard the possibility of modifying existing 
laws and regulations has to be considered, with the re-writing of state and 
commonwealth agreements. 
Objectives 
In the statement of objectives, account has to be taken of the demands and needs 
for water, and the likely limits on supply. Water scarcity and interstate and 
intrastate competition for this limited resource also have to be considered in the 
statement of objectives. A rather general statement is as follows: 
 
To match, as closely as is economically and technologically feasible, the 
quantity and quality of water provided against the realistic needs of the various 
uses (domestic, industry and irrigation) and to provide security of supply over 
the planning period. 
 
This formulation treats both demand and supply as variables. On the other hand it 
skirts the problem of differentiating between need and demand. The prediction of 
realistic figures for demand versus need thus becomes a central task to be 
undertaken in this project. The above statement does not stipulate that water will 
always be available without restriction, for example in times of severe drought, 
although some minimum level of supply is clearly implied.  
 
The linked concepts of technological and economic feasibility allow for 
changes and improvements in technology over the planning horizon. For example 
the economic feasibility of desalination plants is likely to improve substantially in 

Engineering Planning and Design 
99 
 
the next decade, assuming that there is continued development and improvement in 
efficiencies in the relevant technologies.  
Performance requirements and operating conditions 
The water supply system will have to accomodate a progressive increase in the 
quantity of water to be supplied through the planning period, and not just in 2040. 
A wide variation in conditions in this period must be expected, including effects 
such as progressive climate change and alternating drought and flood throughout 
the state and in the upper reaches of the Murray-Darling system. Drought and flood 
can even occur at the same time in different parts of the system. In taking account 
of these possibilities, it will be necessary to specify minimum limits on the 
quantities of water to be supplied on a daily, weekly and yearly basis. Quality 
limits also have to be specified. Separate statements of the requirements for 
domestic use, industrial use and irrigation use may be needed. Above all, the 
performance requirements have to be realistic and achievable. 
Measures of effectiveness 
Total cost in dollar terms is one prime measure of effectiveness, but certainly not 
the only one. Another measure is needed in regard to the reliability of supply, 
which can be measured, for example, by the number of days per year when 
restrictions occur. Another measure may be needed for the quality of the water 
supplied, taking account of the average and peak salinity levels. Adaptability of the 
supply system to unexpected changes in demand over the medium term (in other 
words, system robustness) is another possible measure of effectiveness.  
A combined measure of effectiveness might be made in terms of the dollar 
cost per unit of water supplied, using penalty costs to take account of reliability 
and adaptability. Such a measure of effectiveness can be broadened to allow for 
water being supplied at several different quality levels according to different uses. 
This leads to a separate measure of effectiveness for the different water quality 
levels considered. A single overall measure of effectiveness, again in dollar terms, 
could be obtained by differential costing of the different quality levels. The present 
comments are intended to show how a measure of effectiveness might be 
developed. They are not meant to indicate preferred options. 
Feasibility study 
We now look very briefly at the steps listed in Table 3.4, as they apply to the 
present example. 
Checking available resources 
In addition to the main resource, water, we have to consider the financial resources 
that will be available, and the technical resources and expertise that will be needed 
to undertake the project. When each specific option is considered, such as the 
construction of a new dam or the construction of a desalination plant, the specific 
resources and expertise have to be investigated.  

100  
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
Investigating and evaluating constraints 
Some of the constraints to the problem have already been mentioned, such as the 
regulations and laws concerning water quality. It will be necessary in the feasibility 
study to investigate and study them to observe how they will affect the possible 
options and solutions. 
Developing promising concepts  
Some of the possible options for dealing with the problem have been foreshadowed 
in the previous discussion. Consideration has to be given to increasing the use of 
the available but presently unused water resources, such as the storm water which 
flows into the sea. An improved efficiency in the use of other existing resources is 
another important option, for example by reducing the losses that occur due to 
evaporation from open water surfaces and leakage from reticulation pipes. Another 
option is legislation to require the installation of domestic rainwater tanks. Further 
options that are more costly include desalination, recycling and reuse of treated 
wastewater. More radical approaches, which may appear at first sight not to be 
feasible, include the harvesting of icebergs from the Antarctic Ocean. The 
possibility of actively changing the climate to increase rainfall falls into this 
category. 
A more obvious and potentially very effective approach is to curb the increase 
in demand for water, and possibly even reduce demand, through pricing policies 
coupled with education programs to alert the community to the real costs of water 
and to methods for effectively reducing its use. 
Technical evaluation is needed to determine the relative costs, the feasibility 
and the quantities of water that can be delivered by each of the approaches. It is 
unlikely that any one approach will be adequate in itself. It is far more likely that a 
range of the cheaper and more effective measures will be used simultaneously so 
that, together, they produce the volume of water needed.  
While some of the approaches listed might not be feasible today, we must 
remember that although the planning horizon is thirty years, the need for water will 
not suddenly stop in 2040. With improving technology and new scientific 
discoveries, we can confidently expect that some of the options that today seem 
unlikely will become quite realistic over time and may well be introduced at later 
stages as the century progresses.  
Comparing alternatives and eliminating the non-competitive options 
In this project we are dealing with a scarce resource, water, and, as already 
mentioned, a mixed strategy is likely to be appropriate. The employment of some 
options and not others will be decided on the relative costs and efficiencies, which 
will undoubtedly vary over the planning horizon.  
The example being discussed here is different to many engineering projects, 
in that the best solution here will not be found by progressively eliminating all but 
one from a list of options. The nature of the problem means that a mix of options 
will be required, with only the clearly uncompetitive ones eliminated.  
An evaluation of viable options can lead to their ranking in terms of initial 
set-up cost, cost per unit volume delivered, and total amount of water deliverable. 

Engineering Planning and Design 
101 
 
Such a ranking could then be used to make decisions on the mix of options to be 
employed initially and at subsequent stages during the planning period. Regular 
updating of the list, especially when new developments and discoveries are made, 
will allow decisions to be made on when specific options should be taken up. At 
the beginning of the century, unlikely options such as desalination, rain making 
and harvesting icebergs should not be discarded and forgotten; they may well 
become attractive in time, as conditions change, and as the options initially 
employed are exhausted.  
Post script 
Detailed information and numerical data on the supply of water to Adelaide, and to 
the state of South Australia, are available from two planning documents that were 
released by the South Australian Government. The earlier document, from 2005, 
was entitled âWater Proofing Adelaideâ, and presented a plan for ensuring water 
for Adelaide up until the year 2025. The second document, undated but apparently 
from the year 2010, was entitled âWater for Goodâ, which extended the planning 
horizon to the year 2050â.  
The second plan was produced just 5 years after the first one. The reason for 
this may well be that in the years 2006 to 2009 the water inflows into the River 
Murray system were unprecedentedly low, and provided just a very small 
proportion of the average yearly inflow. The River Murray has been traditionally 
the main source of water for the city of Adelaide, together with local catchment 
areas. As a consequence of this apparent, sudden change in climate, a 
desalinisation plant was commisioned in 2014 with an annual capacity of 100 Gl, 
about half of the cityâs usage. Following the construction of the desalination plant, 
rainfall increased and the traditional sources of water have been more plentiful. In 
the period up to 2017, the desalination plant had not been used to capacity, except 
for short trial runs.  
 
 


 
 
 
 
 
CHAPTER FOUR  
Creativity and Creative Thinking 
 
Creativity plays a crucial role in engineering and in particular in the planning and 
design of engineering projects. In this chapter we find that the brain works in some 
quite surprising ways; that much of its success comes from the use of simple 
heuristics (or search rules), and from hard-wired features that allow it to make 
reasonable decisions quickly. However, this form of thinking is convergent in 
nature and does not provide a sound basis for the divergent thinking we need for 
the creative aspects of planning and design. It is, therefore, important to develop 
techniques to enhance a divergent and creative approach to problem solving. We 
review some of the available techniques in the context of engineering problem 
solving. 
4.1 INTRODUCTION 
The aim of this chapter is not to turn everyone into an Einstein or Picasso but to 
demonstrate the need for a creative and open mind in engineering and to show how 
it can be achieved in practice by practise. We have seen in Chapters 2 and 3 that 
engineers are often charged with the responsibility of solving complex, open-ended 
problems; ones that have no single obvious solution and ones that will benefit from 
a novel and creative approach. This may seem easy initially, but, as will be shown  
in this chapter, our brains have evolved to be very efficient at making quick 
decisions that are often quite appropriate, using processes that have developed to 
ensure the survival of the species. However, these are generally not the processes 
needed for creative thinking in engineering planning and design. 
 
Before we look at the operation of the brain, it is worth defining clearly the 
types of thinking that are important to engineers. On the one hand, there is 
convergent or deductive thinking, which aims to apply logic and take in just as 
much information as is necessary to develop a solution to a particular problem. We 
have seen in Chapter 2 that this is the sort of thinking that occurs when people are 
trying to solve an analytical problem, or making a decision by narrowing down the 
alternatives. Gilhooly (1982) quotes a finding that scientists working on the 
analysis of lunar samples as part of the Apollo mission tended towards convergent 
thinking: when presented with an open-ended question, they would quickly 
transform it into a more tightly defined one. Divergent or inductive thinking, on the 
other hand, is aimed at solving problems where there might be a large number of 
possible solutions or where there are no obvious solutions. Divergent thinking 
deliberately takes in as much information as possible without too much concern 
about relevance, and tries to develop solutions by making links that are not 
necessarily obvious or (apparently) sensible. 

104 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
 
An example of divergent thinking is the case of the Swiss engineer, Robert 
Maillart (1872-1940). In 1901 he designed and constructed a bridge at Zuoz in 
Switzerland and noted a couple of years later that a section of concrete webbing 
near the main supports was cracking. The obvious solution was to repair and 
strengthen it, but Maillart instead investigated the behaviour of the structure and 
found after some study that the presence of cracks in those locations was not 
having a detrimental effect on the bridgeâs performance. On this basis he modified 
his design to take advantage of this finding, leading to a much more efficient cross-
section for the girders (Ferguson, 1999). Many must have observed the cracking at 
Zuoz, but he was able to think about it in quite a different manner and come to a 
quite different and highly creative solution.  
 
We will now explore creativity (or divergent thinking) in engineering â what 
it is, how it can be recognised, how it can be promoted, and why it is important in 
the planning and design of projects. It is worth noting at this stage that much of 
what we know about creativity comes from work undertaken by highly creative 
individuals and that when we consider creativity, we are looking not just at the 
solutions to engineering problems but also to problem formulation. As Findlay and 
Lumsden (1988) have argued, this âmay be just as much a part of the creative 
process as its solutionâ. 
4.2 CREATIVITY DEFINED 
Creativity is an elusive concept. Bohm (1996) believes that it is impossible to 
define in words, but others have tried. One definition that picks up many of the 
elements is by Gardner (1993) who defines the creative person as one âwho 
regularly solves problems, fashions products, or defines new questions in a domain 
in a way that is initially considered novel but that ultimately becomes accepted in a 
particular cultural setting.â He goes on to suggest that âinitial rejection is the likely 
fate of any truly innovative workâ. Gardner was looking for much more than 
general creativity, and was attempting to pick out individuals who had shown 
significant creative output. As a matter of interest, he selected Albert Einstein 
(physicist), T.S. Elliot (writer), Sigmund Freud (psychologist), Mahatma Gandhi 
(politician and statesman), Martha Graham (dancer), Pablo Picasso (painter) and 
Igor Stravinsky (composer) for his list from a wide variety of fields, and justified 
each based on his definition.  
 
We propose that, for engineering planning and design, creativity must 
demonstrate novelty, value and eventual acceptance in the posing or solution of 
engineering problems. The requirement for eventual acceptance means that it is not 
possible to dismiss ideas at the time they are generated. It is worth remembering 
the numerous examples of ideas that were ridiculed when first presented, only to 
be accepted some time later when it was agreed they came âbefore their timeâ. 
 
In the next section we look at the brain and its workings with the aim of 
showing just how constrained human thinking often is, and how much of what we 
do is governed either by features that are hard-wired into our brains or by the 
unconscious application of simple rules or heuristics. In the later sections, various 
procedures are outlined to demonstrate how it is possible to coerce the brain to 
ignore these rules, and to work in a way that promotes creativity.

4.3 THE BRAIN AND ITS WORKINGS 
As recently as two hundred years ago little was known about the brain, and serious 
research into the functioning of the brain really only began in the first half of the 
20th Century. The fact that many parts of the brain are named after their shape rather 
than function gives an indication of just how little was known. For example, in the 
brain there are areas called the âponsâ, âamygdaleâ and âhippocampusâ named after 
bridges, the shape of almonds, and seahorses, respectively (Rose, 1998). It is only 
quite recently that it has been possible to determine the actual functions of some 
brain regions using techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging 
(fMRI), which is able to measure oxygen uptake rates as a measure of neural 
activity, and positron emission topography (PET) which can measure, in addition to 
oxygen uptake rates, the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine (Knutson 
and Peterson, 2005). Based on these studies it is now known, for example, that the 
hippocampus is important for short-term memory and the ability to make mental 
maps, while the amygdala handles fear and other emotions.   
 
The basic building block of the brain is the neuron. Humans start with around 
one hundred billion neurons, but the number declines with age. Neurons (see 
Figure 4.1) have a cell body with input (dendrite) and output (axon) channels that 
connect to other cells. The number of input and output channels per neuron can be 
many thousands. The contact between neurons is made at synapses and each 
neuron has between a thousand and ten thousand synapses. A section of brain the 
size of a grain of sand contains about one hundred thousand neurons, 2 million 
axons and one billion synapses (Ramachandran and Blakeslee, 1998).

to adjoining cells. Note that the staining technique highlights single neurons and so does not show the 
density of connections to adjacent cells. Â© Used with permission of Synapse Web. 
 
 
The connections in the brain develop from birth (Klawans, 2000) and are 
strengthened by use. The infant brain starts with a high level of redundancy in the 
form of parallel paths. In fact, one of the strengths of the human brain is based on 
its parallelism which is measured as fanout: the number of direct contacts a neuron 

106 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
makes with other neurons (Holland, 1998). Typical computer elements have a 
fanout of about 10, whereas human central nervous system neurons have a value 
between 1,000 and 10,000. It is believed that this explains much of the potential for 
complex behaviour. Until more details are available on exactly how neurons store 
information, it is not possible to determine a measure of brain power based on a 
simple neuron count but a comparison with other animals is instructive. Camazine 
(2003) points out that honey-bees, with approximately one million neurons, have 
the capability to navigate by the sun, fly to a food source, make what appear to be 
decisions, communicate with other honey-bees, and perform other complex 
activities. Boden (2004) tempers any enthusiasm for reading too much into these 
sorts of abilities with a description of the hoverfly which, although capable of quite 
complex behaviour, has much of it hard-wired into its brain and nervous system. 
With this understanding, she believes that the hoverflyâs intelligence âhas been 
demystified with a vengeanceâ.  
 
There is still debate about the exact mechanism that the brain uses to store 
and process information, but it would appear that the synaptic connections are 
heavily involved. When messages are transmitted the synaptic gap (approximately 
1/40,000 mm) is reduced, making further communication along that path easier. In 
this way pathways are established leading to patterns that the brain can use. 
Pathways that are not used retain a large synaptic gap and are therefore less likely 
to be used. Researchers in computing are using this model to add some 
âintelligenceâ to the Internet. According to Brooks (2000), a mechanism for making 
active World Wide Web links has been developed so that links that are used most 
commonly are given prominence and those that are not used for a time are 
discarded. In this way the Internet may be able to optimise data collection by 
highlighting the most common paths and making them easier to follow (a 
convergent thinking approach). Whether this will actually assist people gathering 
information is yet to be seen. There could be an argument for not wanting to follow 
all the paths that everyone else on the Web has followed but allowing a few less-
travelled ones to come up in searches (a divergent thinking approach). One way to 
achieve this might be to allow searchers to specify an equivalent acetylcholine 
level for the search. Acetylcholine in the brain is important in strengthening 
synapses. It is in particularly high levels during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep 
and it has been suggested (Phillips, 1999) that this might be a reason that dreams 
during REM sleep can be so bizarre. 
 
One of the findings that has come from research is the level to which the 
brain manipulates raw data before presenting it to the consciousness. As an 
example, consider the sense of sight. It has been discovered that when a human 
âseesâ, information is being passed to approximately 30 different areas of the brain, 
with each working on a specific aspect of the vision (Ramachandran and Blakeslee, 
1998). For example, there are separate areas for colour, depth, motion, slopes of 
lines, edges, and outlines. According to Goleman (1995) studies have identified 
neurons that only fire in response to certain facial expressions such as a threatening 
opening of the mouth, a fearful grimace, or a docile crouch. There is also a group 
of neurons that fire in response to âseeingâ the shape of the back of a monkeyâs 
hand (Popper and Eccles, 1977). What this means is that many decisions are 
effectively made using hard-wired sets of neurons rather than conscious thinking. 
We do not look at someoneâs face and actually have to think about what it is 

Creativity 
107 
 
showing â as soon as our eyes gaze on the face, neurons fire in response to aspects 
they have evolved and the brain is fed the information that the face is showing; for 
example, a threatening opening of the mouth. This results in extraordinary speed, 
but at a cost: it is automatic, and we do not necessarily realise that. 
 
It is not commonly known, but every eye in every human has a significant 
defect, i.e. a blind spot. The fact that there is such a problem was first discovered 
centuries ago by a researcher studying the optics of the visual system, and is due to 
the geometry of the lens and retina. That it should be so well hidden says more 
about the brain than the eye. The brain actually assists the eye and âfills in the 
missing detailsâ automatically. An example of a test picture that can illustrate the 
effect is shown in Figure 4.2. To demonstrate the effect: hold the diagram close to 
the face with the left eye looking directly at the circle and the right eye closed, then 
move the page away from the eye. At a certain distance the cross should disappear 
from the peripheral vision and be replaced by the general background.  
 
Once the effect has been observed, just stop and think for a second. The brain 
is âmaking upâ some of what it reports it is seeing! If this is true, then people 
cannot or should not necessarily believe what they are seeing, because everything 
that they pick up is filtered and modified by the brain, mostly in a harmless way, 
but modified nonetheless. 
 
The human brain is the result of approximately 200,000 years of evolution 
since Homo sapiens split from earlier ancestors (Gould, 1991). For most of that 
time humans were living in a more primitive world where many of the decisions 
were ones of life and death and where survival led to an emphasis on quick 
reasonable solutions rather than slower well thought out ones. Cohen and Stewart 
(1995) make this point in relation to avoiding black and yellow stripy things. Often 
they might not be tigers, but it is not worth having a complicated and time-
consuming procedure to work this out because this will not aid survival!  
 Figure 4.2 Example of a diagram that can be used to illustrate the optical blind spot. Hold it close with 
the left eye looking directly at the circle and the right eye closed, then move the page away until the 
cross disappears. 
  
We now turn to conscious thinking and find that there are also issues with this 
activity, especially where creativity is concerned. Most high school graduates 
majoring in mathematics and science would consider themselves to be well trained 
in thinking. However, much of the training has been to develop skills of a very 
specific kind. There are various terms for the traditional type of thinking: 
convergent, analytical, vertical, and logical are just a few. Application of this type 
of thinking means that people start at a particular point and move one step at a 
 

108 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
time, justifying each step as they go and narrowing down the options until it leads 
to a clear solution. This type of thinking is particularly true in mathematics, for 
example, where there is generally a correct way of arriving at an answer. Even if 
there is more than one way, each follows a logical sequence of steps that lead on 
from the last. Although this type of thinking is important, and particularly so in 
engineering, there is another type of thinking that is equally important, namely, 
creative, divergent or lateral thinking. De Bono (1970) classifies the key 
differences between vertical and lateral thinking and these are listed in Table 4.1.

The concept of right brain and left brain 
 
In the late 1960s Roger W Sperry, an American who was later to become a 
Nobel laureate in 1981, discovered that the human brain has two very different 
ways of thinking.  
 
In popular psychology, âleft-brainâ and âright-brainâ became terms associated 
with both personality traits and cognitive strategies, where a left-brain individual 
or cognitive style is typically verbal and processes information in an analytical 
and sequential way, looking first at the pieces then putting them together to get 
the whole, and a right-brain individual has a more creative style that is visual and 
processes information in an intuitive and simultaneous way, looking first at the 
whole picture then the details.  
 
However, based on fMRI, Nielson et al. (2013) identified the broader left-
dominant and right-dominant connectivity networks, with a more consistent 
scheme including left-dominant connections associated with language and 
perception of internal stimuli, and right-dominant connections associated with 
attention to external stimuli. 
 
 
 
A student educated in science and mathematics might look to the right hand 
side of characteristics and be horrified at some of the entries. For example, âdoes 
not have to be correctâ and âwelcomes intrusionsâ seem like odd ways of tackling 
serious engineering problems, but these are in fact ideal when one considers that 

Creativity 
109 
 
the brain has not been designed to tackle tasks where one wants lots of solutions 
and where the time taken to arrive at the solution is of limited importance. 
4.4 THE BRAIN AND HEURISTICS 
According to work by a number of researchers (e.g. Gigerenzer and Goldstein, 
1996; Borges et al., 1999; Cross and Jackson, 2005) much of the convergent 
thinking we do can be described based on the application of very simple rules 
(heuristics). These heuristics are interesting for two reasons: firstly, to see how real 
decisions are made, and secondly, to highlight the need to force the brain to act 
otherwise in situations where quick and dirty decisions are not wanted. 
Recognition heuristic 
We start the description of the recognition heuristic with a simple example. In one 
experiment (Reimer and Katsikopoulos, 2004) a group of U.S. university students 
was asked to say which city was larger, San Diego or San Antonio. The correct 
answer was given by 66percent of the group. When a similar group of German 
university students was asked the same question, 100percent of them selected the 
correct answer. So how is it that German students seem to know more than U.S. 
students about American cities and their size? The explanation given was in terms 
of the recognition heuristic (Goldstein and Gigerenzer, 2002). In this type of 
question with only two alternatives, if someone recognises only one of two 
options, then they will assume that that one is likely to be the correct answer. In 
this case, it was likely that the German students had heard of San Diego but not 
San Antonio and so selected the former. The recognition heuristic is often referred 
to the âless is more effectâ. The less one knows, the better the chance of getting the 
correct answer! The method will of course only work in situations where there is a 
systematic bias in the options, but is important nonetheless. Of course, once people 
know more than the basic minimum that particular heuristic breaks down and 
people move on to other more complicated ones.  
Minimalist heuristic 
The next stage in decision making is to use a very small piece of additional 
information and the minimalist heuristic. Continuing the search for the larger of 
two cities: if one is forced to choose between two about which a little is known, it 
might be good to ask which has an airport, or a national soccer team â then choose 
that one. Again, this way of thinking gives a quick and easy answer and will be 
reliable under a wide range of situations.  
 
One of the minimalist heuristics is âTake The Lastâ. In this, a problem is 
tackled using the scheme that was used to solve a similar looking problem last 
time. This may seem a sensible approach and will often work, but it can have its 
problems. In one experiment reported by Gilhooly (1982), a group of people were 
given three water jugs of different volumes and asked to make up a particular 
volume of water by manipulating the quantities. For example, when given 18, 43, 
and 10 litre jugs and asked to make 5 litres people found, after some manipulation, 
that the answer was to fill the 43 litre jug, then use it to fill the 18 litre jug and then 

110 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
the 10 litre jug twice leaving the required 5 litres. Having gotter good at this and 
other similar problems, they were then given 28, 76, and 3 litre jugs and asked to 
make 25 litres. The subjects had difficulty because they were intent on using all 
three jugs because that had been necessary previously. 
Take the best heuristic 
The next stage in the decision-making process is to gather additional data, and to 
sift through it until one choice comes up as the best. At this stage the search stops. 
According to Gigerenzer and Goldstein (1999) the âTake the Bestâ heuristic works 
as well or better than more complicated decision-making methods such as linear 
and multiple regression in selected situations, and is faster as well. This conclusion 
was based on the study attempting to determine the larger of two cities where nine 
pieces of information were available for each including, whether it was a capital 
city, or had a soccer team, an intercity train or a university. It has been suggested 
that this is the process that humans go through when searching for a mate. They set 
up a list of requirements and search until someone matches enough of them, at 
which time they move to the next phase of decision making.   
Availability heuristic 
One of the aspects that has fascinated people studying human behaviour is the way 
people assess danger and its relative likelihood. Shark attacks and aeroplane 
crashes, for example, are relatively rare yet people will overestimate their 
perceived danger from such events. This has been put down to what is called the 
availability heuristic where âindividuals estimate the frequency of an event, or the 
likelihood of its occurrence, by the ease with which instances or associations come 
to mindâ (WÃ¤nke et al., 1995). As Tversky and Kahneman (1973) point out, the 
ease of recall should be related to relative frequency (and often is) but it should be 
understood that this short-cut is being used because there are times when it does 
not work. An example of where it works was given in an experiment by Tversky 
and Kahneman (1973) where subjects were given 7 seconds to estimate how many 
flowers, or four-legged animals or Russian authors they would be able to list in 2 
minutes. Their estimates and subsequent performance was highly correlated and 
the authors suggested that a very quick assessment allowed people to make an 
accurate prediction of their recall ability.  
 
However, the heuristic is open to abuse and can perform poorly in some 
circumstances. Tversky and Kahneman (1973) also described examples where it 
did not work. In one experiment, subjects were asked to estimate the relative 
frequency of words starting with the letter âkâ compared to words with âkâ as the 
third letter in typical text. Most could think of more words starting with âkâ so 
estimated that these were more frequent. In fact, words with âkâ as the third letter 
outnumber words starting with âkâ 2:1 in typical text. In a second experiment, 
subjects were asked to estimate (very quickly) the product: 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 
x 8. Others were asked to estimate (very quickly) the product: 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 
x 2 x 1. The median guess for the first group was 512, while the median for the 
second was 2,250. The true answer is 40,320. Tversky and Kahneman suggest that 
in estimating the product, subjects looked at the first few terms and extrapolated 

Creativity

based on that. They were unable to appreciate the exponential nature of the sum, 
particularly those who were considering where 1 x 2 x 3 ... would be going. 
 
The use of the availability heuristic has important ramifications for engineers. 
As an example, Kates (1962) studied the decision-making process in relation to the 
provision of flood protection works: 
 
A major limitation to human ability to use improved flood hazard 
information is a basic reliance on experience. People on flood plains 
appear to be very much prisoners of their experience ... Recently 
experienced floods appear to set an upper bound to the size of loss with 
which managers believe they ought to be concerned.  
First instinct fallacy 
When students take multiple choice question exams and tests, conventional 
wisdom states that one should go with the answer that was chosen based on first 
instinct. In fact, some guides aimed at helping students recommend this course of 
action. However, it is very likely wrong despite peopleâs opinion to the contrary. 
Why this is so can be explained very well by looking at how the brain reacts to 
being right and wrong and what regret might follow a wrong decision.  
 
In a series of experiments with university students undertaking multiple 
choice exams, Kruger et al. (2005) tested student experience and came to a number 
of conclusions: 
 
ï· 
the majority of answer changes were from incorrect to correct, and most 
people who changed their answers improved their test scores; 
ï· 
changing the correct answer to an incorrect answer was likely to be more 
frustrating and memorable than failing to change an incorrect answer to the 
correct answer; 
ï· 
the majority of changes were from wrong to right, but studentâs intuitions said 
the opposite; 
ï· 
there is more regret associated with switching from a correct to an incorrect 
answer than failing to switch from an incorrect answer to a correct answer; 
ï· 
there is a memory bias: students overestimate how many times they have 
switched from correct to incorrect and underestimate how often they failed to 
switch from a wrong answer; 
ï· 
people who were observing the selection of answers from multiple 
possibilities were more critical of those who switched from a right answer than 
of those who did not switch from a wrong answer; and finally 
ï· 
the first instinct fallacy strengthens in the face of mounting personal evidence 
to the contrary.  
 
 
The important point in all of this is to realise that when humans make 
decisions they are pre-programmed to make âfast and frugalâ ones (Gigerenzer and 
Goldstein, 1996). While this is good for survival in a more hostile world, or 
appropriate when pressed for time, it must be realised that if a team is developing a 
solution to an engineering problem it is important to be careful to avoid taking one 
of the quick solutions that the brain generates so easily, and to work in a more 

112 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
methodical way. It will not feel natural. It will be fighting against everything the 
brain has ever wanted to do, but it should be done. 
4.5 CREATIVITY AND THE EUREKA MOMENT 
When Francis Crick and James Watson realised that one of the implications of 
DNAâs double helix was the potential to explain the passing on of genetic 
information, it seemed to be one of the many breakthroughs based on a brilliant 
flash of inspiration by another of the geniuses that fill the pages of history. But, it 
is not quite as simple as that. Crickâs sudden insight occurred in 1952, but by that 
time he had been studying the problem of the structure of DNA for over a year â 
thinking of little else, discussing little else, working on little else. It may have been 
a brilliant flash, but he had prepared himself well for it.  
 
The more one studies people that are regarded as creative geniuses, the more 
it becomes evident that there is much more to creativity than the sudden flash of 
inspiration. Archimedes in his bath, and Newton and the apple under the tree: in 
each case the real story is much more complicated than the popular folklore, and in 
each case the discovery came after years of hard work. 
 
 
The original Eureka! 
 
Many know that Archimedes discovered something while overflowing a bath and 
ran down the street shouting Eureka, but the details are not always as clear. 
Koestler (1964) gives a good description.  
 
Eureka is Greek and translates as âI have found it!â. The use of it to describe 
some sort of mental breakthrough dates from Archimedes who had been given 
the task of determining whether a crown given to his king was in fact pure gold, 
or gold mixed with a lesser metal. Knowing the density of gold the task was 
therefore to decide the volume of the crown and to check its density. A lower 
density would indicate that the gold had been mixed with a lighter element. 
Archimedes pondered the task of deciding the volume. If he could melt it down 
he could measure its volume but that was not an option. Whether it is apocryphal 
or not, the story goes that one day as he was getting into his bath, Archimedes 
noticed that as he got in his body displaced the water and it overflowed. He 
realised that if he submerged the crown it would displace its own volume and he 
would be able to measure it accurately. He then set off down the street overjoyed 
at his discovery. 
 
 
 
There appears to be a general agreement that it takes approximately 10 years of 
consistent work before significant outcomes eventuate in scientific discovery, and 
the fact that there is little apparent progress does not mean there is no progress. 
According to Bronowski (1978), âthe discovery is made with tears and sweat (at 
any rate, with a good deal of bad language) by people who are constantly getting 
the wrong answerâ. Gilhooly (1982) and Miller (2001) catalogue the stages 
involved in a creative leap: 
 

Creativity 
113 
 
ï· 
preparation, where the problem solver familiarises himself or herself with the 
problem by engaging in âconscious, effortful, systematic and usually fruitless 
work on the problemâ; 
ï· 
incubation, where the problem is set aside and no conscious work is done on 
it;  
ï· 
illumination or inspiration, where a break is made which, even if not the 
complete solution, leads to an advance; and 
ï· 
verification, where conscious work is done to test the idea. 
 
 
Several of these stages deserve further examination. The incubation stage is 
an interesting one and highlights a mode of thinking that many believe to be 
crucial to human thought: that carried out by the subconscious. Both Albert 
Einstein and the French scientist Henri PoincarÃ©, for example, were firm believers 
in the power of this type of thought and deliberately structured their work to make 
the most of breaks from conscious thought. While sitting not thinking may sound 
appealing, it should be noted that it presupposes that work has been done 
beforehand so that the brain has something to work with! The act of creativity is 
most clearly associated with the third stage, where things come together in a novel 
and useful way. A key point that is made by a number of researchers is that the 
new idea does not appear from nowhere, but comes from the making of novel 
connections between information already stored in the brain. On this point, 
PoincarÃ© believed that new mathematical ideas must be âbeautifulâ and that the 
brain actually used this beauty to identify the potentially valid ideas from the mass 
of others (PoincarÃ©, 1908). This need for existing knowledge underlies many of the 
methods designed to enhance creativity, as we shall now see.  
4.6 TECHNIQUES FOR STIMULATING IDEAS 
At this stage it is worth reflecting on what we have found so far about human 
brains and thinking. Brains like short-cuts and have developed a whole range of 
them to allow us to make quick and often quite good decisions. Brains also hide 
much of their inner workings and are far more pre-programmed to work with 
anticipated situations than we realise.  
 
Engineers and scientists are generally well trained in convergent thinking; 
making use of a minimum of information to come to a solution quickly. They may 
even resist divergent thinking and the sorts of operations necessary to carry it out. 
Yet, in many engineering planning and design problems this is exactly the type of 
thinking that is needed. Therefore, it may be necessary to use a series of seemingly 
odd and somewhat artificial procedures to force the brain to act in a manner that 
suits these types of problems. It will not feel natural. It will not make sense. 
However, with practice, it will allow the development of some quite innovative 
solutions that no level of convergent thinking could ever approach. 
 
For many problems that are presented to engineers, there will be an obvious 
âcommon senseâ solution that most will see quite quickly. The value that can be 
attributed to the idea that led to the common sense approach is therefore minimal. 
However, if one engineer comes up with quite a different solution, one that no-one 
else had thought of, its value is much higher. That is the aim of creative thinking: 

114 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
to come up with those different ideas. Much of the time they may not lead to a 
better approach, but every now and again they will and those times are worth 
striving for. 
 
If any further encouragement was required to promote creative thinking it 
might come from knowing how many ideas it takes to come up with a truly 
successful one. Stevens and Burley (1997) carried out such a study by investigating 
the relationship between new ideas in an industrial setting and how many 
progressed on to success as commercial products. Based on a wide range of views 
and data they suggest that for every 3,000 raw ideas, about 150 are developed to 
the stage where a patent application is filed. Of these applications about 112 are 
issued with patents of which only 9 have commercial significance. Of those, only 1 
leads to major commercial success. It seems we need ideas, and we need lots of 
them. 
 
One of the common aims of the various methods is to force the brain to look 
at things in a different light and to make connections that it would not normally 
make. According to Findlay and Lumsden (1988) âthe creative process ... is 
derived from the establishment of new links among already existing elementsâ. In 
the following sections, a number of established and accepted methods for 
enhancing creativity are outlined. They are not in any particular order and it should 
be noted that each method will have situations where it is suited and some where it 
is not. Therefore, they should be read with an open mind. Nothing stifles creativity 
more effectively than a sneering cynic. 
Attribute listing 
Attribute listing works best where there is an existing solution or product and a 
better one is being sought. As Svensson (1974) has pointed out, this may be with 
the aim of eliminating defects from a product, improving its operation or reducing 
costs. The steps involved are: list all the components or elements of the existing 
solution; list all the attributes of the component (e.g. weight, size, colour, shape, 
material etc.); and then systematically change each attribute in every conceivable 
way. 
 
As an example, taken from Miller (2000), consider an improved design for a 
heating system radiator using attribute listing. The elements of the existing 
product, their present attribute and other possibilities are listed in Table 4.2. There 
are two complementary ways the information at this stage can be used. Firstly, if 
improvements are required to the existing designs, then some of the possible 
attributes can be evaluated while leaving the others fixed. For example, it may be 
beneficial to consider the effect of changing the colour of the product. Superficial 
changes of different shades of white or cream are possible, but what about a paint 
that changes colour as it heats? This may enhance the design and improve safety 
by reducing the chance of accidental burns or scalds. There are similar options that 
could be tried for all the attributes. Alternatively, is there a quite different finish 
that does not involve paint? Or might the finish make the product essentially 
invisible?

Secondly, combining all present and possible attributes leads to 5 x 6 x 5 x 4 
x 3 x 4 x 6 = 43,200 different possibilities and these could be evaluated. One of 
these is the current configuration, and many will not make any sense, but some 
surprising and challenging alternatives may come from this, and may prove 
valuable. For example, some of the variations include: 
 
ï· 
plastic sphere that rolls around the floor filled with oil; 
ï· 
transparent plastic tubing filled with coloured water; 
ï· 
black metal tubing filled with hot oil; 
ï· 
plastic tube that is mobile and filled with oil; it comes in a variety of colours. 
 
 
The challenge is to see if and how these can lead to something new and 
viable. If nothing else, the various combinations can be used to foster discussion, 
and to explore what is really required for a solution. In any case, the main aim has 
been fulfilled in that the designer has been forced away from seeing all home 
radiators as flat metal components fixed to a wall. At the early stages of the design 
process, the rule should be quantity not quality of concepts. Another important 
consideration is that sometimes ideas that come up using this technique can be 
better applied in a quite different area. For example, consider the last of the four 
examples listed, the mobile plastic tube filled with oil. While this may not be 
suitable for warming a room, it may be ideal as a hand warmer or a foot warmer 
for  cold nights. It was not what was asked for but it is worth being open to the 
unexpected. The mobility idea could provide the germ of further ideas: why for 
example should one heat a whole house if it is possible for a person to carry a heat 
source around and so be comfortable anywhere? 
Morphological synthesis 
Morphological synthesis (also called âmatrix analysisâ) is similar in some ways to 
attribute listing in that it involves the generation of unusual combinations of 
system functions; however, it is more focussed on generating completely new ideas 
rather than just improving existing ones. The steps involved are: describe the 
problem by its systems; list the major system parameters; list the alternative ways 
of satisfying each system parameter; draw up a matrix with each system parameter 
as one dimension; and then consider all possible combinations of ways of 
satisfying each parameter. 
 
For example, it is desirable to establish innovative public transport systems in 
cities, and then a morphological synthesis can be used to generate alternatives. If 

116 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
the three major system parameters are considered to be the route alternatives, 
energy source and method of support the results can be generated as shown in 
Table 4.3. 
 
Table 4.3 Morphological synthesis used on public transport. 
 
System parameter
Possible solutions
route alternatives
rail, road, monorail, water, air
energy source
liquid fuel, electricity, gas, solar, wind, animal
method of support
wheels, air, magnetic, wires, rail
 
 
The method has generated 5 x 6 x 5 = 150 combinations, which include: 
 
ï· 
an electric powered monorail with magnetic levitation; 
ï· 
gas powered vehicles travelling over water with air suspension; 
ï· 
solar powered buses with wheels on a road. 
 
 
Many of the 150 may be infeasible; some will already exist; others will not 
make any sense at all. However, if there is one that is worth further consideration, 
or one that sparks a new idea of some sort, then the time spent using the method 
has been well spent.  
Setting a minimum quota 
One of the main problems in developing novel or creative solutions is the tendency 
to apply one of the brainâs shortcut heuristics and go with the first viable solution 
that comes to mind. In many cases this may appear to work, but it is a convergent 
thinking technique and it is possible that other equally viable (and possibly 
superior) solutions may be overlooked. To overcome this, it is considered good 
practice to set a minimum quota of ideas which must be generated. In this way the 
tendency to follow the best idea as soon as it occurs is overcome. De Bono (1970) 
suggests a limit of around four or five as a minimum. Better advice is to estimate 
how many solutions there are, and then seek double or triple that number.  
 
As with many of the methods that are used to develop creativity, the setting 
of a minimum quota works on a number of levels. Firstly, it forces a number of 
solutions to be generated. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it forces the 
engineer to think about the problem more deeply and to consider much more 
carefully what might be considered a solution. 
 
The idea of setting a quota does not actually help generate new ideas, but it 
forces the search to continue and is certainly worth the effort. McCormick (2004) 
warns against the practice of setting rituals where a certain number of ideas must 
be generated for a âcorrectâ solution, so it is important to keep in mind the 
importance of the exercise rather than the idea that a certain number of ideas will 
produce the correct answer (as there is no single correct answer). 
Challenge assumptions and implied solutions 
One of the issues with problem solving is the tendency to impose limits on the 
solution due to assumptions which are made even without realising it. For 

Creativity 
117 
 
example, consider for a moment the task of creating a new design for a toothbrush. 
Even with no further instructions it is likely that one would assume that the 
solution being pursued would have to be portable, cheap, hand-held, able to use 
standard toothpaste, taste and odour free, able to be purchased easily, and instantly 
recognisable as a toothbrush. With all these constraints in place it is no wonder that 
any innovative design that is unlike what currently exists is virtually impossible. 
But are these really necessary? A truly innovative approach might come from 
altering the question to âdesign a new way of protecting teethâ and this in turn 
could lead to the search for a much wider solution than the current toothbrush 
affords. Whatever the outcome, it is important to realise that humans are very 
likely to self-impose creativity-limiting assumptions as part of a convergent 
approach. 
Suspended judgment 
The purpose of thinking creatively is not to be right, but to be effective. In general 
thinking there is a tendency to judge each and every aspect of new ideas and to try 
and discard them on any particular or perceived flaw. History, however, provides 
ample examples of people who were quite wrong about aspects of their work or 
thoughts and yet made great advances. According to Kolb (1999), Kepler, the 
astronomer who formulated the three famous rules of planetary motion developed 
them based from a question that came to him in the middle of a lecture to 
undergraduates: why are there six planets? From that poor starting position the 
excellent work that demonstrated the properties and consequences of the planetsâ 
elliptical orbits followed. In fact, in the field of astronomy good results have come 
from ideas and calculations containing basic errors. According to Thornton (2000), 
Neptune was discovered based on calculations that showed there was something 
(possibly a new planet) affecting the orbit of Uranus. The calculations contained an 
error but, as luck would have it, one that had little effect at the particular time the 
search for the cause of the disturbance was undertaken. Had the search been 
undertaken at a different time, the error could have made it a futile one. 
 
According to de Bono (1970), there are several advantages with suspending 
judgement on ideas: 
 
ï· 
an idea will survive longer and may breed further ideas; 
ï· 
other people will offer ideas which they themselves may have discarded but 
which others can make something of; 
ï· 
ideas can be accepted for their stimulating effect; and 
ï· 
ideas which may be judged wrong in the current frame of reference may 
survive long enough to show that the frame of reference was wrong. 
 
 
The way in which suspension of judgement is used (de Bono, 1970) is that: 
 
ï· 
one does not rush to judge or evaluate an idea, one explores; 
ï· 
some ideas which are obviously wrong can be used to explore, not why they 
are wrong but how the idea could be useful; 
ï· 
even if one knows that an idea will eventually be thrown out, one keeps it for 
as long as possible to get as much out of it as possible; and 

118 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
ï· 
instead of forcing an idea in a given direction, one follows the idea to see 
where it will lead. 
 
 
Marconi and radio transmission 
 
There have been occasions when people have done things which were 
impossible or wrong, and it turned out that despite everything being against it the 
final result was what they were seeking. Guglielmo Marconi succeeded in 
transmitting radio waves across the Atlantic believing that the waves would 
follow the curvature of the earth. He had been working on transmitting radio 
waves and had been able to achieve it over increasing distances. First in metres, 
kilometres, and across the English Channel. He was convinced he would be able 
to do a transatlantic transmission so he set up a transmitter in England and set 
up an aerial held aloft by a large kite in Newfoundland. He waited. People told 
him radio waves would travel in straight lines so he would not be able to do it. 
But he did it, and in that respect was correct. The people were also right when 
they said radio waves travel in straight lines, but did not understand that the 
earth had an ionosphere from which the waves could bounce. If Marconi had 
listened to others he would not have made the breakthrough. 
 
 
 
Gilhooly (1982) reports on a study where subjects were asked to generate 
solutions to a particular problem for 5 minutes. One set of subjects was asked to 
work in a conventional manner, evaluating ideas as they went. In the other they 
were asked to defer judgment. A team of judges then evaluated the ideas. The first 
group produced 2.5 âgoodâ ideas (on average) while the second produced 4.3 
âgoodâ ideas. The higher productivity was explained in terms of suspending 
judgement. 
Brainstorming 
Brainstorming is a technique that was developed in the 1940s and 1950s by a 
businessman, Alex Osborn (Gilhooly, 1982). When it was first introduced it took 
off quite quickly, and has now been applied in industry and evaluated in the 
laboratory. According to Gilhooly (1982) ânumerous studies support the 
hypothesis that groups using brainstorming produce more ideas than similar groups 
that work along conventional linesâ. There are also reports of not only more ideas, 
but better ideas too, coming from brainstorming sessions.  
 
A brainstorming session usually involves 6 to 12 people. Two officials are 
needed; a chairperson and a recorder. The chairperson introduces the topic, 
enforces the rules and is responsible for maintaining a continuing flow of ideas. 
The recorder makes a note of all ideas. The topic must be formulated in such a way 
that it is not too vague. Since the brainstorming session will be straining the limits 
of creativity starting with a vague problem could lead to an over-wide collection of 
ideas. At the same time the problem must not be over-formulated so that some 
exploration around the topic is possible. This comes with experience. The rules of 
a brainstorming session are (de Bono, 1970; Perkins, 2000): 
 
ï· 
all ideas must be recorded; 

Creativity 
119 
 
ï· 
no idea may be criticised or evaluated during the session (suspend judgment); 
ï· 
it is permissible to build on the ideas of others; and 
ï· 
the emphasis is on quantity of ideas; quality follows from quantity. 
 
 
It is better to record the ideas on a whiteboard or similar so that all 
participants can see them. At the start of the session the chairperson introduces the 
topic and sessions tend to last around 30 to 45 minutes. As a way of enforcing the 
rules and maintaining the flow of ideas the chairperson should: 
 
ï· 
stop people trying to evaluate or criticise other peopleâs ideas; 
ï· 
stop people all talking at once; 
ï· 
make sure the recorder has written the idea down; 
ï· 
fill in gaps by offering ideas; 
ï· 
suggest different ways of tackling the problem; 
ï· 
define the central problem and keep pulling people back to it; 
ï· 
end the session either at a designated time or when things are flagging; and 
ï· 
organise the evaluation session. 
 
 
Culp and Smith (2001) suggest that it may be beneficial if, at the start of a 
session, everyone spends a couple of minutes writing down their own ideas with no 
discussion. Then the session starts with the ideas being read out in turn. This is 
designed to ensure everyone gets an initial word in and that the more dominant 
personalities do not take over the session.  
 
Often, in the course of a brainstorming session the flow of ideas can wane 
and there is a prolonged silence. A âtriggerâ is a very useful device to restart the 
ideas. A number of triggers have been suggested. These include: 
 
ï· 
a checklist; 
ï· 
wildest fantasy; 
ï· 
juxtaposition. 
 
 
One checklist is provided by the acronym SCAMPER and is listed in Table 
4.4. The use of âwildest fantasyâ as a trigger encourages all participants to think of 
the wildest idea. Some of these may lead to other more practical solutions. 
âJuxtapositionâ involves the following steps: 
 
ï· 
select three words at random; 
ï· 
discover a connection between each word and the problem being studied. 
 
 
The best words to use are familiar ones such as water, meat, cup, or pen. For 
example, in trying to suggest ideas for the design of a vehicle which does not use 
fossil fuels a group has run out of ideas. They decide to use juxtaposition as a 
trigger, and select the words pencil, water and chicken. The word âpencilâ then 
may lead to the suggestions of using wood as a fuel, making the vehicle long and 
thin to reduce drag, using graphite as a fuel or lubricant, and a vehicle which walks 
on stilts. The other words will also generate discussion in a similar way.

Water supply in the developing world  
 
According to New Civil Engineer (2002), the World Summit on Sustainable 
Development held in Johannesburg in 2002 developed an aim to halve the 
number of people without access to proper sanitation and to have all people with 
access to clean water by 2020. In a surprising twist, the World Bank and the 
United Nations called for no new infrastructure but a program of education and 
water supply improvements. Although large schemes seem the logical way to go, 
experience has shown that unless there is full subsidy of the schemes they are 
rarely sustainable and the result is a flawed system of broken pipes and pumps 
and a lack of local skilled personnel to effect repairs.  
 
âThe role of the engineer in these countries will need to change, along with their 
perception of what constitutes success.â 
 
 
 
There must be no evaluation of ideas in the session. That is a task for later. 
Statements that must be discouraged include: "that would never work because ... ", 
"it is well known that ... ", and "how would you get to do that ... ". The ideas 
generated should be evaluated several days later. Evaluation is better carried out 
without consultation between participants. One possibility is to give several people 
the list and ask them to identify the best 10%. These could then go on and be 
further evaluated and developed. In the evaluation session which follows some 
time later, the central tasks are to 
 
ï· 
pick out the ideas which are directly useful; 
ï·

ï·

wrong at first;

Although there are supposed to be some benefits in having a number of 
people in a group feeding each other ideas and benefiting from the group dynamics 
there is also evidence that a single-person brainstorming session can be beneficial. 

Creativity 
121 
 
Here the main benefit comes from the deliberate suspension of judgement and the 
idea that âanything goesâ. Studies have shown that a nominal group made up of a 
number of people working individually can combine outputs to produce a better set 
of solutions than a group of the same size working as one (Gilhooly, 1982).  One 
Nominal Group Technique (Delbecq et al.,1975) can be as simple as individuals 
first thinking of as many ideas as possible to solve a particular problem in a 
designated time. Then pairs are formed and all ideas are combined and further 
ideas are added building off the individual lists. No ideas are to be rejected. Then 
two pairs are combined with all ideas listed and any more ideas added within a 
designated time period. Assessment of the ideas can be done by combining all the 
groups' ideas and then everyone having a certain number of votes such as 5, 4, 3, 2 
and 1 to allocate for the ideas that they favour.  
Reading and contemplation 
A common theme among many individuals who have made significant 
breakthroughs is the place reading and study played in their lives. Charles Darwin 
was a voracious reader and his natural selection breakthrough came to him 
following his reading of a work by Thomas Malthus on population dynamics. 
Albert Einsteinâs theory of relativity came after reading David Humeâs An Enquiry 
Concerning Human Understanding and he made no secret of the benefit he had 
obtained from reading it (Edmonds and Eidinow, 2006). Isaac Newton and 
numerous other scientists of note were all well known for their reading that 
covered a wide range of topics from science to philosophy. The power of reading 
also comes to lesser mortals. James Ellis was a leader in the field of code-breaking 
and code-making. Singh (1999) suggests that one of the reasons for Ellisâ success 
was his breadth of knowledge:  
 
He read any scientific journal he could get his hands on, and never threw 
anything away. ... if other researchers found themselves with impossible 
problems, they would knock on his door in the hope that his vast knowledge 
and originality would provide a solution. 
 
 
The same must be true for much of life and lifeâs experiences. A wider 
knowledge base provides different ways of looking at things and a much greater 
chance of seeing something from a different perspective (Ferguson, 1999):  
 
 
More important to a designer than a set of techniques (empty of content) to 
induce creativity are a knowledge of current practice and products and a 
growing stock of first-hand knowledge and insights gained through critical 
field observation of engineering projects and industrial plants.  
 
 
The benefits of reading come not only from the additional knowledge that 
may be gained, but also from the stimulating effect that reading has on the brain. 
As has already been noted, creativity comes from making novel connections 
between pieces of information stored in the brain, and the active thinking that goes 
on as one reads assists in this process.

More than a bit player: Howard Hughes Snr. 
 
The movie âThe Aviatorâ (starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett) tells 
the story of the early years of Howard Hughes Jnr. who made a name for himself 
producing Hollywood movies, building and flying aeroplanes, setting speed and 
distance flying records, and generally making the most of his money, youth and 
talent. The source of his early money was based entirely on a single invention 
that his father, Howard Hughes Snr, had patented: a drill bit for the oil industry 
that was particularly good at drilling through rock.  
 
Hughes Snr. had been in the mining industry, but was lured to Texas with the 
discovery of oil near Beaumont in 1901. He worked in a number of locations and 
by 1907 had a partner in a small business although Bartlett and Steele (2003) 
note that he was âusually too independent-minded to work with anyoneâ. In 1908 
Hughes met a millwright, Granville Humason, who had designed a new drill bit 
and who showed him a wooden prototype. Humason had come up with the idea 
for the drill one morning as he ground his coffee and had shown it to a lot of 
miners but no-one had been interested. Hughes offered him $150 on the spot for 
it, which was accepted. Hughes then rushed to work up a patent application and 
had the device patented in the U.S. and overseas. The final drawing was carried 
out on the kitchen table. Again, according to Bartlett and Steele (2003): 
 
He emerged from the family dining room with the Archimedean cry of âEurekaâ 
and the picture of a bit that had no less than 166 cutting edges. 
 
 
And the rest, as they say, is history. Hughes went on to be awarded over 70 
patents and founded a company that generated tens of billions of dollars. The 
interest in the story is to consider what it was that made Hughes Snr. 
successful? According to the biographers, he was a stickler for details. They also 
contend that he would have no doubt been aware of the previous attempts to 
patent such a drill bit and would have recognised the significant breakthrough it 
represented. Perhaps the real success was based on a good notion of what the 
idea was really worth and the need to protect that with good patents. Hughes 
spent at least $1500 on that first patent and worked hard to maintain and protect 
it. 
 
Fostering creativity 
While one of the aims of this chapter is to promote creativity in individuals, a 
related aim is to ensure that those who are creative will have their ideas received in 
a positive environment. People should be able to recognise and appreciate 
creativity, and remember that it will not always be logical, immediately useful or 
even sensible under current thinking. According to a co-worker (quoted in Singh, 
1999) of James Ellis, the cryptographer mentioned earlier:  
 
He was a rather quirky worker, and he didnât really fit into the day-to-day 
business of GCHQ. But in terms of coming up with new ideas he was quite 
exceptional. You sort of had to sort through some rubbish sometimes, but 
he was very innovative and always willing to challenge the orthodoxy. We 
would be in real trouble if everybody in GCHQ was like him, but we can 

Creativity 
123 
 
tolerate a higher proportion of such people than most organisations. We 
put up with a number of people like him. 
 
 
Creative individuals are not necessarily those that are highly intelligent (there 
is only a moderate correlation between creative ability and IQ) and so many will 
not stand out in an academic sense. In many cases their ideas will be of little value. 
Note above that the workers with Ellis âhad to sort through some rubbish 
sometimesâ, but in the end having creative people around is well worth it because 
when virtually everyone comes up with the same solution, the truly creative person 
will be the one who has a different idea that no one else had thought of or 
considered. That is when they come into their own. And that is why everyone 
should try to be more creative and to appreciate and nurture those who are. Goel 
and Singh (1998) have a similar message when they urge businesses to 
âunderstand that creative ability of most people is fragile and could be seriously 
suppressed by destructive criticismâ and to design a company structure that 
âenhances rather than detracts ... from useful creative activityâ. 
4.7 SUMMARY 
The brain is a complex, power-hungry, secretive, manipulative and vital organ that 
defines human beings. It gives us the sapiens in Homo sapiens and is the product 
of 200,000 years of evolution since our species split from earlier ancestors. The 
brain has developed a particular skill in coming up with reasonable solutions to 
many problems in the minimum of time, often without any formal decision-making 
process, often using a large number of hard-wired techniques. 
 
If the brain is to be used for creative thinking a conscious effort must be 
made to force those with convergent thinking away from natural methods of 
solution and towards ways that ensure that unusual or unexpected results can 
follow. There are a range of methods that can be employed including attribute 
listing, morphological synthesis, the use of a quota, brainstorming and extended 
reading and thought. Each takes practise and time, but it will be time well spent. 
PROBLEMS 
4.1 Apply attribute listing to the problem of trying to generate at least 50 new ideas 
for a different type of ball point pen. 
 
4.2 Use morphological synthesis to generate at least 20 new ideas for a new way of 
drying clothes in a typical suburban house. 
 
4.3 In 2 minutes write down as many uses that can be thought of for a paperclip. 
Start now! 
 
4.4 Use a one person brainstorming session to devise ways of reducing fuel 
consumption for the average family car. In 10 minutes try and generate as many 
ideas as possible.

4.5 Assume the government has put out a tender for development of a mobile 
kitchen that could be used for the army in exercises in remote and arid areas. The 
unit must be suitable for preparing hot meals for a group of 20 soldiers. Generate at 
least five quite different solutions to the problem. 
 
4.6 Suggest five creative solutions to the problem of an existing bridge that 
vibrates excessively when people run over it. 
 
4.7 The people who prefer not to define creativity often resort to the argument that 
they can recognise it when they see it. Consider your group of friends and 
acquaintances and identify creative ability in them. What are the main 
distinguishing characteristics? 
 
4.8 If the Eureka moment comes after much concentrated study and thought, what 
are the implications for students wishing to master a subject at university? 
 
4.9 If truly creative people really do see life differently and think about problems 
and solutions in very novel ways, what fraction of the population do you think they 
should be? What are the issues to be considered?

CHAPTER FIVE  
Project Scheduling Techniques 
 
When a large engineering project is undertaken, there are many activities that 
have to be coordinated, and careful planning is needed if the project is to be 
completed on time and within budget. Scheduling techniques to assist in the 
planning of large projects, including the critical path method (CPM) and the Gantt 
Chart, are considered here. The use of these techniques assists in identifying and 
scheduling activities so that the project can be completed in the minimum feasible 
time. The rescheduling of activities taking account of limitations on certain critical 
resources is also discussed.  
5.1 
INTRODUCTION 
Project scheduling deals with the timing and sequencing of the many activities that 
comprise a large project. It requires a comprehensive understanding of the project 
and informs other project management and control processes. Project scheduling 
will be used at different times within a project and will become more specific as 
the project progresses. For example, a schedule developed after the detailed design 
will be more comprehensive than the schedule developed during the preliminary 
design of the same project. Scheduling entails identification of the activities 
required within the project, estimation of the duration of each activity, 
identification of the precedence relations between activities (i.e. which ones need 
to precede others) and development of an organisational network or schedule that 
represents this information accurately. Such an organisational network can be used 
to provide the following information: 
 
ï· 
the minimum time to complete the project if all activities run on time;  
ï· 
the activities that are critical to ensure that the project is finished in the 
minimum time; 
ï· 
the earliest start time and the latest finish time for each activity, if the project 
is to be finished in the minimum time; and 
ï· 
the amount of time by which each activity can be delayed without delaying the 
project as a whole. 
 
 
An organisational network can also be used to examine the times when 
resources (human resources, cash and equipment) need to be supplied and whether 
limits on these resources are likely to cause delays in the project completion. 
Furthermore, an organisational network can be used to identify which activities 
should be accelerated if the project needs to be completed in a shorter time than the 
current estimate. 

128 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
 
This chapter serves as an introduction to project scheduling techniques. It 
provides a brief overview of their historical context and explains the steps required 
to develop and use the resultant organisational network and/or charts. Software is 
available to assist project managers and engineers develop and control project 
schedules. Such software is essential for large and complex projects, with 
potentially thousands of interconnected activities. However, it remains important 
for an engineer to develop an understanding of the underlying concepts and 
approaches upon which the software has been developed. This enables engineers to 
adapt their use of the software to suit the project being considered.  
5.2 
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 
Although project planning is sometimes considered as a recent development, the 
construction of structures such as the great Pyramids of Egypt and the Americas, 
Stonehenge and the statues on Easter Island undoubtedly required considerable 
organisational, resource management and scheduling skills. Unfortunately, there 
are no records of how these projects were planned, scheduled or managed. 
 
One of the first modern scheduling techniques developed to assist in project 
planning was the Gantt Chart. This was created in 1917 by Henry Laurence Gantt 
(1861â1919), an American mechanical engineer. The first Gantt Chart was 
developed for planning the building of ships during World War I. A Gantt Chart is 
a graph in which the horizontal axis represents time. All activities are listed down 
the page with each activity having a horizontal bar representing the planned timing 
of its completion. Gantt Charts can have varying levels of complexity and are 
discussed in Section 5.4.  
 
In the late 1950s several techniques were developed to assist in the planning 
of complex projects. These include the critical path method (CPM) and the 
program evaluation and review technique (PERT). CPM was developed in the late 
1950s by Morgan Walker of E.I. Du Pont and James E Kelly of Remington Rand 
Univac Corporation and was first used to schedule maintenance shutdowns in 
chemical processing plants. PERT was developed by Booz, Allen & Hamilton and 
the US Navy with the aim of coordinating the many thousands of contractors who 
were working on the Polaris missile program (Griffis and Farr, 2000; Shtub et al. 
2005). Both techniques use a network of arrows and nodes to represent the 
activities in a project. Calculations can then be carried out to determine important 
information, such as that listed in Section 5.1. The basic difference between the 
two techniques is that CPM assumes that the durations of all activities are known, 
whereas PERT represents the durations of activities as random variables with 
optimistic, pessimistic and most likely estimates of their durations. In the 1980s, 
Gantt Charts were modified to include links between tasks so that they could also 
include certain attributes of CPM. 
 
This chapter contains a description of CPM and Gantt Charts. As noted 
above, Gantt Charts were developed before CPM; however, they are introduced 
after CPM in this text to allow a more logical development of the concepts. It is 
these techniques, including PERT, which form the basis of modern project 
scheduling and control software. Progress can be tracked, assessed and updated at 
the task level, work package level or project level.  

Project Scheduling Techniques 
129 
 
5.3 
THE CRITICAL PATH METHOD 
As already mentioned, CPM uses a network of arrows and nodes to represent all 
activities in a project. Two different types of notation are commonly used. These 
are called activity on node (AON) and activity on arrow (AOA). Either notation 
can be used to represent the precedence relationships between activities. To 
illustrate the two notations, consider a simple project consisting of five activities 
(A, B, C, D and E). Suppose that Activity A must be completed before Activity B 
can commence, Activity C must be complete before Activity D can commence and 
Activities B and D must be complete before Activity E can commence. An 
organisational network for the project using activity on arrow notation is shown in 
Figure 5.1 (a), while the network using activity on node notation is shown in 
Figure 5.1 (b). 
 
 
(a) Activity on arrow notation 
 
 
(b) Activity on node notation 
 
Figure 5.1 Two types of network notation. 
 
 
In the AOA notation in Figure 5.1 (a), the arrows represent the activities and 
the nodes are used to represent the precedence of activities. The nodes are 
arbitrarily numbered, so that each activity has a unique designation in terms of its 
start and end nodes. For example, Activity A is designated 1-2, Activity B is 
designated 2-4 and so on. Starting at node 1, Activities A and C have no preceding 
activities, so both may commence immediately. Activity B cannot commence until 
activity A is completed, so its start node is the end node of Activity A. For 
example, Activity A may represent the construction of footings for a house and 
Activity B the construction of the walls. In this case, Activity B cannot commence 
until Activity A is complete. 
 
Similarly, Activity D has its start node (3) as the end node of Activity C. 
Now, why do both Activities B and D end at the same node? This is a notational 
convenience that also achieves a compact network, as Activity E requires them 
both to be completed before it can commence. There are other equally valid ways

to draw this diagram that will be described later. Finally, as shown, Activity E can 
only start after both Activities B and D are complete and it finishes at Node 5. In 
this network, Node 5 also represents the completion of the project. 
 
Figure 5.1 (b) shows an organisational network for the same project using 
AON notation. For this notation, a box represents an activity. There is also a box 
for the start and finish of the project. Arrows then represent the precedence 
relationship between activities. From the information provided above, Activities A 
and C do not need any activities to be completed before they can start. Therefore, 
they can both commence at the beginning of the project as shown in Figure 5.1 (b). 
Activity A must be completed before Activity B can commence, so an arrow goes 
from A to B. Similarly, Activity C must be completed before activity D, so an 
arrow runs from C to D. As both B and D must be completed before Activity E 
commences, they both have arrows running into Activity E. Finally the project can 
end once Activity E is finished. 
 
AOA notation will be used for the remainder of this chapter, as it is more 
commonly used in practice. 
 
There are four basic rules to observe when constructing AOA organisational 
networks. These are: 
 
1. the network must have one starting node and one finishing node representing 
the start and finish of the project, respectively; 
2. each activity is represented by a single arrow in the network; 
3. before an activity can start, all activities leading to its starting node must be 
complete; and 
4. there can be, at most, one arrow between any pair of nodes in the network. 
 
 
Rule 4 is required to ensure that each activity is uniquely defined by its 
starting and ending nodes. On occasions this may require the use of dummy 
activities. These are artificial activities of zero duration that are used purely to 
maintain the logic of the network. An example of the use of dummy activities is 
shown in Figure 5.2.

For the project shown in Figure 5.2, Activity A must be completed before 
both Activities B and C can commence. Activities B and C must both be completed 
before Activity E can commence. Figure 5.2(a) shows both Activities B and C 
passing from Node 2 to Node 4. This satisfies the precedence rule (Rule 3 above), 
but does not satisfy Rule 4. Figure 5.2 (b) shows an alternative representation in 
which a dummy activity, D1, has been introduced. This network satisfies all the 
given rules. 
 
Dummy activities can also be used to represent the precedence logic in a 
network rather than specifically to satisfy Rule 4. An example is where there are 
four activities that form part of the project. These are designated A, B, C and E. 
Activity A must be complete before Activity C can commence, but Activity E 
requires both Activity A and B to be complete before it can commence. An 
organisational network for this project is shown in Figure 5.3. Note that a dummy 
activity, D1, has been introduced to satisfy the precedence logic.

Application of the Critical Path Method 
The CPM process for project planning involves the following steps: 
 
1. list all activities that form part of the project; 
2. estimate the time to complete each activity (called the duration of the activity); 
3. identify the precedence relationships, i.e. for each activity, which other 
activities must be completed before it can commence; 
4. construct the network; 
5. analyse the network to identify the earliest start time (EST) and latest finish 
time (LFT) for each activity; 
6. identify the critical path(s) for the network; 
7. use the EST and LFT to estimate the latest start time (LST) and earliest finish

The critical path method will be demonstrated by applying it to a case study. 
This is the construction of a single span highway bridge over a creek. Simplified 
design drawings of the bridge are shown in Figure 5.4.

Step 1: List all activities that form part of the project. 
An experienced engineer typically prepares the list of activities for the project. The 
complexity of the project and the level of control required will dictate how the list 
is provided. The activities can be presented as a sequential list or a hierarchical list. 
A hierarchical list is referred to as a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and is used 
to group similar tasks or activities undertaken by the same contractor. For example, 
all off-site activities may be grouped together and all on-site activities could also 
be grouped together. The hierarchical structure can provide added flexibility in 
relation to the level of detail presented and reported. A basic sequential list is used 
for this example, with the list of activities given in Table 5.1 The project involves 
fabricating the steel girders and handrails off-site and then transporting them for 
installation on site. Concrete will be produced off-site and delivered to the site 
ready to pour. All other activities will take place on-site.

Step 2: Estimate the duration of each activity. 
The durations estimated are given in Table 5.1. These are based on the assumption 
that adequate equipment and human resources are available on-site to complete the 
activities without delays. In this simple example many simplifying assumptions 
have been made. For example, the construction of the foundations, abutments and 
embankments on each side of the creek would be considered as separate activities, 
as they may be scheduled to occur simultaneously or in sequence, depending on 
the available resources. In this case, these items are assumed to be undertaken on 
both sides of the creek simultaneously. A further practical consideration is the 
planning involved in transporting major items of equipment to the site and 
scheduling their usage. Such considerations have been ignored in this simple 
example in order to demonstrate how organisational networks are developed and 
analysed.

Step 3: Identify the precedence relationships.  
The relationships determined for this project are given in Table 5.1.  
Step 4: Construct the network.  
The construction of the network is a relatively straightforward task once steps 1-3 
have been completed. However, steps 1-4 can involve several iterations as the 
process of drawing the network can facilitate thoughts about the activities involved 
and their inter-relationships and dependencies. The completed network is shown in 
Figure 5.5.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5.5 Organisational network for construction of the highway bridge. 
 
 
The network satisfies the four basic rules given in Section 5.3 and includes 
two dummy activities. The dummy activity, D1, between Nodes 16 and 4 ensures 
that Activity T (place hotmix on approaches and on the bridge deck) cannot 
commence until Activity P (cure concrete deck) is complete. The other dummy 
activity, D2, between Nodes 16 and 17 ensures that Activity Q (install handrails) 
cannot commence until Activities P (cure concrete deck) and L (fabricate steel 
handrails off-site and deliver to the site) are complete. Two dummies are required 
in this instance because Activity Q does not depend on the completion of Activity 
S (construct pavement on approaches) being complete and Activity T does not 
depend on Activity L being complete. Some work can be undertaken on the 
abutments before the concrete of the foundations has reached its design strength so 
the duration for the curing of the concrete in the foundations has been set at 7 days. 
Step 5: Analyse the network to identify the earliest start time (EST) and latest 
finish time (LFT) for each activity. 
The earliest start time (EST) for an activity is the earliest time that it can commence 
assuming all preceding activities and the overall project starts on time. The latest 
finish time (LFT) for an activity is the latest time that it can finish without 
increasing the minimum completion time for the overall project. The EST and LFT 
are shown on Figure 5.6 with the EST shown in the left-hand box and the LFT in 
the right-hand box. Typically, the EST and LFT would be documented for each 
node. In Figure 5.6 this information is presented only at significant nodes for clarity. 
 
The ESTs are calculated in the following way: Begin at the first node (i.e., 
the node that has no arrows leading into it). In this case this is Node 1. Set the EST 
at this node to be 0. For each subsequent node the EST is determined by examining 
all activities leading into the node. For each activity determine the sum of the EST

of its start node plus its duration. Take the largest of these values to give the EST 
at the new node.  
 
For example, Node 2 has only 1 activity (A) leading into it. Clearly the EST 
at Node 2 is the EST at node 1 plus the duration of Activity A (3 days), thus giving 
an EST of 3 days at node 2. Similarly, the EST at Node 5 is the EST at Node 2 (3 
days) plus the duration of Activity B (4 days) giving 7 days. Node 6 has 2 activities 
leading into it (C and D). The EST at Node 6 is the larger of the EST plus duration 
for these 2 Activities. For Activity C, its EST is 7 days and its duration is 3 days 
giving a total of 10 days. For Activity D, its EST is 0 days and its duration is 5 
days, giving a total of 5 days. The larger of these two is 10 days which is, 
therefore, the EST at Node 6. This clearly must be the case, because no activities 
starting at Node 6 may commence until all activities feeding into this node have 
been completed. That is why it is the larger of the two times. 
Mathematically, EST at Node j (ESTj) can be determined using the following 
equation:

(5.1) 
 
where, Dij = the duration of Activity ij; and Ij is the set of all starting nodes that 
have activities that finish at node j. 
 
The determination of ESTs requires the nodes to be considered in a certain 
order. For example, the EST at node 4 requires the EST at nodes 3 and 16 be 
determined first. This can be accomplished by starting at the node that has no 
activities leading into it and working one at a time to nodes that only have 
activities with known ESTs coming into them. This can be carried out by 
observation when working simple examples (such as this one) by hand and is 
programmed into software used for analysing more complex organisational 
networks. 
 
Latest Finish Times (LFTs) are determined in a similar fashion by working 
backwards in time in the following manner: Start at the final node (the one with the 
largest EST. The LFT at this node is the same as the EST. Then work backwards 
one node at a time and considering all Activities that commence at the node. The 
LFT is the smallest of the LFT of any Activities that start at the node minus their 
duration. For example, the LFT at Node 20 equals its EST of 71 days. The LFT at 
Node 19 is the LFT of Activity W (71 days) minus its duration (7 days) and is 
therefore 64 days. The LFT at Node 4 is the LFT of Activity T (64 days) minus its 
duration (3 days). It is therefore 61 days.

There are two activities leading from Node 3. Therefore, the LFT at this node 
is the smaller of the LFT minus the duration for each of these activities. Activity S 
has a LFT of 61 days and a duration of 10 days and therefore a difference of 51 
days. Activity U has a LFT of 64 days and a duration of 5 days and therefore a 
difference of 59 days. The smaller of the two (51 days) then becomes the LFT at 
Node 3. Mathematically, the LFT at Node i can be determined using the following 
equation:

(5.2) 
 
where, 
iJ  = the set of all ending nodes that have activities that commence at Node 
i.  
 
As for the EST, the determination of the LFT involves careful selection of the 
sequence of nodes to be considered. A partial check on the calculations of EST and 
LFT is provided in that the LFT should be 0 at the first node. Although, if this 
value is obtained it does not necessarily mean that all values of EST and LFT are 
correct. 
Step 6: Identify the critical path(s) for the network. 
The critical path is the set of all activities that cannot be delayed without delaying 
the entire project. There is always at least one critical path from the first node to 
the last node. There may be more than one critical path in some cases. The 
minimum time to complete the project is given by the length of the critical path. 
This is also given by the EST and LFT at the last node.  
 
In the example illustrated in Figure 5.6, the critical path consists of the 
following sequence of activities: A, B, C, E, F, G, H, I, J, M, N, O, P, Q, V, and W. 
The minimum time to complete the project is 71 days. It can also be seen that the 
EST and LFT are the same for all nodes on the critical path.  
Step 7: Use the EST and LFT to estimate the latest start time (LST) and earliest 
finish time (EFT) for each activity. 
The latest start time (LST) for an activity is the latest time that it can start without 
increasing the minimum completion time for the overall project. The earliest finish 
time (EFT) for an activity is the earliest time it can finish if it and all preceding 
activities start at their earliest start times. 
 
It should be clear that the LST for each activity is simply its LFT minus its 
duration. Likewise the EFT for each activity is simply its EST plus its duration. 
LSTs unlike ESTs are not necessarily the same for all activities starting at the same 
node in the network. Likewise, EFTs are not necessarily the same for all activities 
that finish at the same node in the network. The EST, LST, EFT and LFT for all 
activities in the example are given in Table 5.2. 
 
It should be clear from the definitions that the EST and LST are equal for all 
activities that are on the critical path. Similarly, the EFT and LFT are also equal for 
these activities. This is verified by the values given in Table 5.2. 

Project Scheduling Techniques 
137 
 
Step 8: Use the EST, LST, EFT, LFT and duration for each activity to estimate its 
total float, free float and interfering float. 
The total float (TF) for an activity is the amount of time that the activity can be 
delayed from its EST without affecting the time to complete the overall project. 
The total float must be zero for all activities on the critical path. For other 
activities, it may be determined by computing the difference between the LST and 
EST. Alternatively, the TF may be determined by computing the difference 
between the LFT and the EFT for each activity. The TFs for all activities in the 
example problem are shown in Table 5.2.

The free float (FF) for an activity is the amount of time that the activity can 
be delayed from its EST without affecting the starting times of subsequent 
activities. Once again, the FF is zero for all activities on the critical path. For non-
critical activities, the FF is determined by subtracting its EST and its duration from 
the EST of its ending node. This can be calculated for all activities using the 
information contained in Figure 5.6. The FFs for all activities are given in Table 
5.2. For example the FF for Activity K is based on the EST at Node 12 (38 days) 
and the EST at Node 1 (0 days). The FF is the difference between these (38 days) 
less the duration of the activity (21 days) giving 17 days. 

138 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
 
The interfering float (IF) for an activity is simply the difference between its 
TF and FF. These values are also given in Table 5.2. The use of interfering float 
could delay subsequent activities, although it will not affect the time to complete 
the overall project. 
 
The TF for Activity K is all FF, as the use of this time will not affect the 
timing of subsequent activities. On the other hand, the TF of Activity R (30 days) 
is all IF, as it will reduce the float available to Activities S, T and U if it is utilised 
by delaying Activity R. 
Summary 
The construction and analysis of an organisational network can provide very 
valuable information that is needed to manage major engineering projects. This 
information includes the following: The minimum total time required to complete 
the overall project, the activities that cannot be delayed without affecting the total 
time to complete the overall project, a summary of activities that need to be 
completed before any particular activity can be started, the earliest start, earliest 
finish, latest start and latest finish times for all activities and the float time for all 
non-critical activities (i.e., by how much time they can be delayed without 
affecting the time to complete the overall project or without affecting the timing of 
subsequent activities. 
 
Because of its great value, it is common to use an organisational network for 
all major engineering projects. As previously discussed, CPM provides the basis 
for modern scheduling software packages. 
5.4 
GANTT CHARTS 
As noted in Section 5.2, a Gantt Chart is an organisational network that represents 
the timing of activities that make up a project. In a Gantt Chart all activities are 
listed down the page with each activity having a horizontal bar representing the 
planned timing of its completion.  
 
Figure 5.7 is a Gantt Chart for the construction of the highway bridge 
considered in Section 5.3. The shaded bars in Figure 5.7 represent the activities 
occurring over time (based on their EST), while open bars represent total floats for 
the corresponding activities. Each activity that has float can be rescheduled within 
the times represented by the open bar without delaying the overall project 
(assuming that all other activities run to schedule). 
 
One advantage of a Gantt Chart compared to a critical path network is that 
the former shows which activities should be running at a particular time (by noting 
which shaded bars are intersected by a vertical line through the corresponding 
time). On the other hand it is not usually possible to draw the Gantt Chart without 
first analysing the relationships between activities using a critical path network in 
order to determine the EST, LFT and floats for all activities. Furthermore, it is not 
easy to depict the precedence relationship between activities in a Gantt Chart for 
complex projects. Although, in theory, vertical lines can be drawn from the end of 
preceding activities to subsequent activities, this can become very messy and hard

to follow for real projects. Nonetheless, Gantt Charts are commonly used to track 
the progress of projects (often in combination with critical path networks). 
 
5.5 
RESOURCE SCHEDULING 
In drawing the organisational networks to date it has been assumed that the only 
factor that constrains the start and finish of activities is the precedence 
relationships, i.e., certain activities must be completed before a particular activity 
can commence. In practice, the availability of critical resources can constrain the 
timing of activities. These critical resources may be human resources such as the 
total workforce, skilled labour in particular areas (e.g. steel riggers or electricians) 
or critical items of equipment (e.g. cranes, bulldozers, graders). Project managers 
must schedule activities taking these critical resources into account, and, in 
appropriate cases acquire additional resources by purchase, lease, rent or 
redeployment from other projects. 
 
A Gantt Chart can be used to indicate the allocation of critical resources on a 
project (or set of projects). A Gantt Chart together with a critical path network can 
be used to reschedule activities so that a project can be completed within the 
resource constraints. 
 
 

140 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
Example 
The example of the construction of the single highway bridge (considered earlier) 
will be used to demonstrate the use of a Gantt Chart to keep track of resources. The 
critical resource considered is the total labour force. For simplicity it is assumed 
that all workers on the project are interchangeable and have the same skill set. In 
reality, there are many different tradesmen and professionals employed on 
engineering projects. The principles demonstrated in this section can be used for 
projects with multiple resources. 
 
Table 5.3 shows the estimated workforce requirements for the activities that 
make up the highway bridge project. Note that Activities G, J and P involve 
allowing the concrete to cure and do not require significant worker involvement. 
 
The information given in Table 5.3 has been summarised in the bottom row 
of the Gantt Chart (Figure 5.7) to show the workforce requirements on each day of 
the project assuming that all activities start at their EST. From the bottom row in 
Figure 5.7 it can be seen that the workforce for the project (based on EST) starts at 
28 workers and builds up to a peak of 30 workers but drops to 9 workers by day 26 
and, in fact is 0 workers for some periods of the project. This is unlikely to be 
optimal. The company carrying out the construction would want to move its 
workers between projects so that all are fully employed and that no project runs 
overtime. A common approach is to attempt to âlevelâ or smooth the resources 
required for any particular project. A trial-and-error process can be used by moving 
non-critical activities within their allowable times so as to smooth the workforce 
requirements as much as possible. 
 
An alternative approach is to reschedule the activities so the workforce used 
on the project stays within a defined cap. For example, suppose that the maximum 
workforce available for this project is 20. It is desired to reschedule activities so 
that the workforce requirements stay within this limit and, if possible, the time to 
complete the overall project does not increase beyond the minimum 71 days. A 
heuristic approach to reschedule activities is presented by Meredith et al. (1985). 
The steps presented by Meredith et al. (1985) are as follows: 
 
1. start with the first day and schedule all activities possible, then do the same for 
the second day and so on; 
2. if several activities compete for the resource, then schedule first the one with 
the smallest float; 
3. then, if possible, reschedule activities not on the critical path in order to free 
resources for the critical path activities. 
 
This heuristic will be applied to the highway bridge project using the data 
contained within Table 5.3 and Figures 5.6 and 5.7. For simplicity it will be 
assumed that once an activity commences it cannot be interrupted in order to 
redeploy workers to other activities. The heuristic can be extended to the case 
where interruption of activities can occur, although there are usually inefficiencies 
in redeploying workers between activities due to the start-up time of activities and 
the need to re-familiarise the workers with the task.

The process commences at the start of the first day. Five activities could start 
(Activities A, D, K, L and R). Activity A is on the critical path and so will be 
scheduled. The total floats for the remaining activities are given in Table 5.4.

As Activity A requires 6 workers, there are 14 available for other activities. 
The order of priority is Activity D, K, R and L. Activities D and K require a total 
of 7 workers thus leaving 7. This is not sufficient for Activity R so it will not be 
started at this time, but L can be, so the scheduled Activities on day 1 are A, D, K 
and L with a total workforce requirement of 17 workers as shown in Figure 5.8. 
This process has been set up in the first rows of Table 5.5 and will be repeated as 
we work through the time schedule of the project.

At the start of day 4, Activity A is completed and Activity B (a critical one) 
is due to start. Activities D, K and L are running and require a total of 11 workers. 
Activity B (requiring 8 workers) Activity R (11 workers) could be started. As 
Activity B is on the critical path it is scheduled to start immediately. The total 
workforce at this time is 19. This process has been continued for the total project. 
It is summarised in Table 5.5. The revised Gantt Chart is shown in Figure 5.8.  
 
It should be noted that the project can still be completed in 71 days with a 
workforce of 20 workers compared with a peak of 30 workers using the EST 
(shown in Figure 5.7). Also note that the organisation network (Figure 5.6) needs 
to be considered when carrying out the scheduling, for example, Activity S cannot 
start until Activity R is complete. 
 
Rather than blindly following the steps outlined above, some judgement has 
been applied in developing the above schedule. For example, Activity R could be 
scheduled to start at the end of day 13. However, it if did start then Activity H 
(which is on the critical path) could not start at the end of day 20 as only 3 workers 
would be available (Activity K and R would be active). This would delay the 
completion of the project as a whole. Therefore, Activity R has been delayed until 
the end of day 21.

Resource Smoothing 
In the above example, the peak workforce was limited to 20 workers. The question 
arises as to what is the minimum peak workforce requirement that does not result 
in the project being delayed. This can be determined using the above procedure 
and progressively reducing the limit on the workforce until the time to complete 
the overall project is increased. Careful examination of Figure 5.8 indicates that a 

144 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
workforce of 20 workers is required from the start of day 39 until the end of day 
41. This cannot be reduced without delaying the overall project, so 20 is the 
minimum workforce to complete the project in minimum time. Of course, if the 
available workforce is less than this (say 17 workers), the above procedure can be 
used to schedule activities so that the project finishes in the minimum possible time 
(which in this case will be more than 71 days). Then a decision will need to be 
made as to whether it is better to accept this delay in the completion of the project 
or to hire additional workers.

SUMMARY 
Project planning may be defined as âthe process used to implement a plan and 
hence to achieve a designated objective, through the efficient use of available 
resources. It involves the regular monitoring of progress and the scheduling of 
activities as appropriate to achieve the objective in the required time frame.â It has 
existed as a science since the late 19th Century. 
 
A number of techniques exist to assist in scheduling the activities of complex 
engineering projects. One of the most commonly used techniques today is the 
critical path method (CPM). CPM can be used to estimate the total time to 
complete a complex engineering project as well as the earliest start time for each 
activity that forms part of the project. CPM can also be used to identify which are 
the critical activities (i.e., those whose delay will result in a delay to the overall 
project). The total float for each activity is defined as the amount of time that the 
activity can be delayed without affecting the duration of the overall project. The 
total floats for all activities can be determined using the CPM technique. Free float 
is another attribute of each activity that can be determined using the CPM. It is 
defined as the amount of time that the activity can be delayed without affecting the 
timing of subsequent activities. 
 
An older technique for scheduling activities that is still used today is called a 
âGantt Chart.â It is difficult to depict all of the precedence relationships between 
activities on a Gantt Chart. A Gantt Chart together with a CPM diagram for a 
project can be used to reduce the peak workforce requirement of a project. 
PROBLEMS 
5.1 A swimming pool is to be constructed in the backyard of a house as shown in 
Figure 5.9. The pool will be 3 m by 1.5 m in plan and range in depth from 2.4 m at 
one end to 1.0 m at the other. It will be constructed of reinforced concrete and 
covered in ceramic tiles on the top and inside. Access to the site will be via a 
driveway, but the carport will need to be dismantled to allow access for 
earthmoving equipment. Assume that you are the contractor who will construct the 
pool from a complete set of plans and specifications. Make a list of the activities 
involved and draw up an organisational network that shows the interdependencies 
between them.

CHAPTER SIX  
Management Processes and Skills  
 
Management is about making the best use of available resources, including money, 
people, time and materials, in order to achieve designated goals. The management 
of engineering projects is a very broad and important field in itself. In this chapter 
we provide a broad overview of the field, and concentrating on the management 
processes and skills that are relevant to the work of planning and design. Of prime 
importance is teamwork and the full effective use of the skills of all individuals. 
Skills to manage oneself and also a team are discussed. The importance of 
personality characteristics of individuals and the roles individuals take in teams 
are also outlined. Skills that are required in managing day-to-day activities and 
provide the basis for undertaking many basic engineering activities such as 
planning, design and construction are also described. Managing conflict, time 
management and effective communication are skills for successfully undertaking 
an engineering project.  
6.1 INTRODUCTION  
This chapter addresses some of the concepts of management and outlines skills 
required by engineers to manage the resources of people and time. An engineering 
manager has to be capable of dealing with the processes related to the planning, 
design, construction and operation of engineering systems. At the same time the 
engineerâs managerial responsibilities include the allocation of human and 
financial resources to enable tasks to be performed. Because of the nature of the 
engineering profession, engineers are members of teams and may take on 
management roles soon after graduation. Engineers therefore need to develop good 
communication and interpersonal skills in order to perform in teams and manage 
people. Throughout history many major engineering accomplishments have 
changed the way societies work. The design and construction of the Pyramids, the 
development of transport systems that crossed continents, the planning and 
construction of major dams such as the Hoover Dam and the Three Gorges Dam, 
the development of the space shuttle and of the personal computer are examples of 
engineering projects that are very different in their nature, but all have changed 
their societies. Such projects were undertaken using various leadership and 
management styles, varying from the one extreme of an autocratic and military 
nature to the laissez faire creative atmosphere in which personal computers were 
developed. While the management structures varied in these examples, the success 
of the project always rested on individuals with special skills who could work 
together in teams to achieve an effective solution using the resources at hand.

6.2 MANAGEMENT HISTORY AND PROCESS 
The earliest management theories developed from the desire to manage workers 
and organizations more efficiently. Engineering management as a discipline has its 
origins in the industrial revolution of the 18th and 19th Centuries. During this 
period, cottage industries were replaced by large industrial organisations in the 
mining, minerals processing, manufacturing and construction sectors. In the late 
19th and early 20th Centuries, engineers and managers attempted to develop a more 
rigorous approach to managing people, machinery and resources to achieve a 
defined end.  
 
The discipline of Scientific Management commenced in the 1880s with the 
work of F.W. Taylor and the time and motion studies of Taylor and Gilbreth in the 
early 1900s. This was followed by Ganttâs analysis of project management and the 
use of charts as outlined in Chapter 5 of this book. Henri Fayol (1841-1925), a 
French mining engineer, described management in terms of planning, organisation, 
command, coordination and control. Fayolâs Administration Industrielle et 
Generale (published in 1916) was translated into English by Constance Storrs in 
1949. From the translation, Fayol says âTo manage is to forecast and plan, to 
organise, to command, to coordinate and to control. To foresee and provide means 
examining the future and drawing up the plan of action. To organise means 
building up the dual structure, material and human, of the undertaking. To 
command means maintaining activity among the personnel. To coordinate means 
binding together, unifying and harmonising all activity and effort. To control 
means seeing that everything occurs in conformity with established rule and 
expressed commandâ (Fayol, 1949). In 1913, Henry Ford adapted time and motion 
studies to the concept of an assembly line for the production of cars.  
 
 
The Venetian Assembly Line 
 
In the 1400s in the city of Venice, which was known for its naval production 
facilities, assembly-line techniques were used to fit out galley ships for war. A 
Spanish traveller in 1436 described the Venetiansâ process (George, 1968): "And 
as one enters the gate there is a great street on either hand with the sea in the 
middle, and on one side are windows opening out of the house of the arsenal, 
and the same on the other side, and out came a galley towed by a boat, and 
from the windows they handed out to them, from one the cordage, from another 
the ballistics and mortars, and so from all sides everything which was required, 
and when the galley had reached the end of the street all the men required were 
on board, together with the complement of oars, and she was equipped from end 
to end. In this manner there came out ten galleys, fully armed, between the 
hours of three and nine." This was an example of an assembly line 500 years 
before Henry Ford (George, 1968). 
 
 
 
 
Shtub et al. (2005) defined management as âthe art of getting things done 
through people.â They identified the following seven functions of management: 
planning, organising, staffing, directing, motivating, leading and controlling. These 
activities are described in more detail in Table 6.1. The similarities to Fayolâs list 
of management functions are obvious. The modern emphasis on motivating and 

Management Processes and Skills 
151 
 
leading staff, as distinct from commanding them, should be noted. It undoubtedly 
reflects a more egalitarian perspective than that which existed in the early part of 
the 20th Century.  
 
Max Weber described bureaucratic management in the 1920s and 
emphasized that order, system and rationality in management leads to equitable 
treatment for employees. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s an effort was made to 
understand human behaviour in the workplace through studies such as that led by 
Elton Mayo at the Hawthorne plant of Western Electric Co. (US). The workers 
were tested to see how their work environment affected their production. Many 
other human relations researchers contributed to the field, including Mary Parker 
Follett, Abraham Maslow, Kurt Lewin, and Renais Likert. In the 1950s, a further 
group of researchers including Douglas McGregor, Chris Argyris, Frederick 
Herzberg, Renais Likert, and Ralph Stogdill proposed behaviour theories. There 
was a mix of psychologists and managerial academics working on organizational 
development and restructuring in the 1960s and 1970s, including people such as 
Fred Emery and Peter Drucker (Ullman, 1986; McShane and Travaglione, 2003). 
 
Table 6.1 Functions of management (adapted from Shtub et al. 2005). 
 
Function 
Description 
Planning 
Setting goals for the organisation. Identifying a course of action 
or plan that will lead to the achievement of these goals. 
Organising 
Assigning people and resources to activities, delegating 
appropriate authority and establishing a structure for reporting.
Staffing 
Ensuring that appropriate human resources are available for the 
desired activities. Ensuring that adequate training and reward 
structures are in place. 
Directing 
Orientating staff and resources towards achieving the goals of 
the organisation. 
Motivating 
Encouraging individuals to achieve their best regardless of the 
tasks undertaken. 
Leading 
Setting an example for others to follow. Encouraging the 
development of group pride and loyalty. 
Controlling 
Monitoring performance relative to the plans. Taking action 
when the desired outcomes are not being achieved. 
 
 
The development of understanding an organization as a system began in the 
1950s, with an emphasis in this approach on explaining outputs in terms of 
transformed inputs, taking into account interaction with the surrounding 
environment. Ludwig von Bertalanffy, a biologist, developed a general systems 
model which contributed to this thinking. Other early systems contributors 
included Kenneth Boulding, Richard Johnson, Fremont Kast, and James 
Rosenzweig. Following World War II, a contemporary School of Management 
evolved which included Deming and Juran, who were the proponents of Total 
Quality Management which transformed many industries in both Japan and the 
United States. 
 
The Contingency School of the 1960s emphasized that management 
processes were dictated by the unique characteristics of each situation. It was 

152 
Engineering Planning and Design 
 
resolved that the complexity of organizations was such that no single management 
strategy supplied the complete answer.  
 
In summary, it has been seen that ideas on management have come from 
many different sources, with a range of tools proving to be useful for solving 
managerial problems. Over time it has been resolved that managerial actions must 
be decided on a situational basis. It is essential that organizations are considered as 
open systems and designed to consider individual needs for harmonious and 
continuing survival.  
Human needs 
All engineers require some management expertise to undertake engineering work. 
The planning, design and construction of projects, the innovative design of 
engineering systems, practical problem solving, managing operations of large 
engineering water and energy utilities and decision-making at all levels of an 
organisation require the management of the needs of a large number of individuals. 
Many engineers will work as project managers where the role is to manage people 
and resources committed to a project to ensure that it is completed on time and 
within budget. The needs of each individual in a project group affect the operation 
of the group, so much so, that the needs and tasks of both the individual and the 
group need to be considered together. 
 
Intrinsically, under an optimistic view of life or the McGregor X style, it is 
assumed that individuals want to do their best (McShane and Travaglione, 2003). 
Research into what makes people work harder and achieve greater output was, and 
still is, of paramount importance to management in organizations. Maslow (1970) 
developed his Hierarchy of Needs, shown in Table 6.2, upon which many 
management researchers based their work.  
 
 
Abraham Harold Maslow 
 
Abraham Harold Maslow (1908-1970) was born in Brooklyn, New York, one of 
seven children born to his Jewish immigrant parents from Russia. His parents 
pushed him hard for academic success. He was lonely as a boy, and found 
refuge in books. Maslow's thinking was surprisingly original because he 
researched positive mental health. Maslow became the leader of the humanistic 
school of psychology, that emerged in the 1950s and 1960s, which gave rise to 
the idea that people possess inner resources for healing and growth (Public 
Broadcasting Service, 1998; Boeree, 2004) 
 
"I was awfully curious to find out why I didn't go insane" - Abraham Maslow. 
 
 
 
Maslow and researchers who followed developed models of the reasons for 
an individualâs work behaviour. Note that these are only models and, in reality, 
human beings are very complex creatures who have many different aspirations that 
drive them. Maslowâs theory suggests that, as a person satisfies one level of need, 
then behaviour is motivated to meet the next level of need. This theory has been 
built upon to explain people and organizational needs of today with various 
alternative variations of the five levels evolving. These models include Alderferâs 

Management Processes and Skills 
153 
 
ERG (Existence Relatedness Growth) theory, Herzbergâs motivator-hygiene theory 
and McClellandâs learned needs, all of which are used to explain employee 
motivation (McShane and Travaglione, 2003).

6.3 WORKING IN GROUPS AND TEAMS 
A group is a term which is vague in concept and can be any number of individuals 
who interact together. A team may be a group of people who work well together to 
achieve a common goal. Effective teams must have members who are willing and 
able to complete the task set, as well as work in a team environment. The size of 
effective teams has always been somewhat subjective because large tasks need 
large teams, but generally teams should be small enough to maintain efficient 
communication and coordination among the team members. Larger groups will 
always break into smaller informal groups to allow effective contributions from all 
members. 
 
The three circles model of Adair (1983), shown in Figure 6.1, illustrates the 
three areas of needs in any group or team. Adair does not take credit for the model 
and its origin is unknown. It has been proposed (Johnson and Johnson, 2000) that 
one of the keys to human development has been the ability to form and work in 
small effective groups. Groups are central to much of human life and engineering 
is no exception. 
 
Whether as a member of tutorial or practical groups as part of undergraduate 
study or as part of a large consulting firm working on multi-million dollar projects, 
engineering students and engineers will generally find themselves part of a group 
and in many cases will take, or be expected to take, a leadership role. 
 
Effective groups are a force to be reckoned with; however, not all groups are 
effective and this can lead to significant problems. According to Johnson and 
Johnson (2000), an effective group 
 
ï· 
achieves its goals (task); 

154 
Engineering Planning and Design 
 
ï· 
maintains good working relationships among members; and 
ï· 
adapts to changing conditions in the surrounding organization, society and 
world. 
 
 
Figure 6.1  Three Circles Model (adapted from Adair, 1983). 
 
 
What is missing here is attention to the needs of individuals in the group 
which is a factor that can make or break a groupâs activity. At present the trend is 
for more group work rather than less. A Fortune 1000 survey in 1993 found that 
91% of companies had implemented some form of team working (up from 70% in 
1987), and in Australia in 1991, 47% of manufacturing companies had employees 
in teams (up from 8% in 1988). 
 
This means that engineers will not only work in groups and teams but in all 
likelihood take some form of leadership role in them as well, given that engineers 
are more likely to be in senior positions. For this reason it is important to know 
how teams work and, more importantly, to know what to do when they start to 
break down. Groups are often formed for a particular project and the members may 
not have worked together before. Members, therefore, can feel a little awkward 
with one another. Since the group will probably be working within a time limit, it 
is important for individuals to understand how groups function in order to improve 
the effectiveness of the team as soon as possible. This will be discussed in Section 
6.6. Figure 6.2 shows some of the group activities undertaken in the problem 
solving processes and the interpersonal processes that involve group maintenance 
and self oriented behaviours.

The question âWhat makes a leader?â has been posed many times. In business, 
sport, industry and academia there are facilitators, coaches, management 
academics and practitioners trying to explain a leadership concept that is broad 
enough to include leaders varying from Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi, Margaret

Thatcher, Elizabeth I, Joseph Stalin, Bill Gates, John F Kennedy, Martin Luther 
King, Mao Zedong, Nelson Mandela, John Monash and Aung San Suu Kyi. We 
will see later that different leaders have different personality styles. 
 
 
Figure 6.2 Behaviours undertaken for group effectiveness (adapted from Adair, 1983). 
 
 
Developing leadership skills in the workforce is paramount to the success of 
organizations. Books, materials, training courses and conferences on the subject 
are plentiful. The challenge is to have the capacity to try out individual actions that 
improve the way things are done through development of an individualâs style. 
Adair (1983) extended the simple three circles model for the functioning of groups 
and teams to show how leaders of teams need to function by maintaining processes 
in each of the three areas of task, group and self. The leader has the responsibility 
to ensure that all areas of need are addressed, the task is achieved, by building and 
maintaining the team and by ensuring the development of the individual. 
 
Teams need a leader to succeed. An effort should be made to designate 
someone to play that role at or before the first meeting. Sometimes a person is 
appointed to the leadership role because of their place in the organisation. 
However, there is no need for that leader to be permanent and omnipotent. The

leader needs to ensure that the task and maintenance functions of the three circles 
model are performed. The roles of the members within the group can be decided by 
natural aptitudes for different functional roles or different people can be assigned 
to take on functions akin to their particular styles. Belbin (1981) outlined eight 
roles that any member of a group prefers to operate in, as shown in Table 6.3. This 
was later extended to nine roles with a specialist type added. 
 
Table 6.3 The proposed team roles of Belbin (adapted from Belbin, 1996).

The Coordinator /Chairperson takes the responsibility of keeping people on 
track, and pays attention to group processes. This person, with the help of the 
Team Worker/Supporter, ensures that all members participate and notices when 
someone is upset. However, it is apparent that when both a Shaper and a 
Coordinator work in a team, one of them has to adopt a secondary preferred role.  
 
The Resource Investigator can also act as a person who serves as liaison 
between the team and the rest of the world. In the context of groups at university, 
this person interacts with the academic supervisor and other groups. We all learn 
from others but mostly from our own experience. It can be said that someone with 
a modest amount of natural ability, who works hard at observing the member 
interactions of group maintenance and self oriented behaviours, as well as the task 
and problem solving process, will forge ahead of a person of high natural ability 
who relies on instincts and never addresses his or her faults. To understand the 
principles of leadership and to work hard at them will ensure success. As Adair 
(1983) stated: âGood leadership is often so silent, so self-effacing, that you are 
hardly aware of it, but bad leadership always shouts at you.â 
Laws of Leadership 
A leader needs vision, discipline and wisdom (Newman, 1994). Vision shows that 
the leader knows what the long-term goal is and discipline is used to ensure that 
energy, time and resources are directed to achieve the goal. Wisdom can be 
considered to be the ability to apply knowledge and experience to any situation.  

Management Processes and Skills 
157 
 
 
The leader also shows courage when different situations demand it. How 
does one create courage? The answer is as Mark Twain said: âCourage is a 
resistance to fear, mastery of fearânot absence of fear.â To make some difficult 
decisions requires courage and this decision-making ability is an attribute that is 
needed by a leader. The leader empowers others to make decisions, as the team 
depends on all members contributing to the process of achieving the designated 
goal. 
 
Friendships and humility are developed throughout oneâs career. Being a 
good listener and trusted confidante helps in mentoring the team, in avoiding 
rivalry and in producing the best outcomes. In each person's career there are times 
when it is necessary to have someone to open up to and ideally that person is the 
leader.  No one survives alone. In developing such relationships a leader must 
exercise tact and diplomacy, and show impartiality. The leader must be prepared to 
learn from those within the team and those outside the team to produce the best 
outcome. Ideally a leader will exude inspirational power and enthusiasm and 
encourage team members to do their best. A leaderâs role is to serve the team so 
that the team will be able to say, âWe did this ourselvesâ. 
6.5 BEHAVIOURAL STYLES OF INDIVIDUALS  
One important consideration when thinking about groups and teams and how 
individuals can be melded into a team is the personalities of all members. There are 
many possible ways of classifying individual personalities. One way is according 
to the kinds of tasks that the person likes to take on: (leader, innovator, or keeper 
of the peace among many others). A search in the literature and the Internet can 
yield many free tests to discover what preferences of behavioural style an 
individual has. It is important to note here that there is no ârightâ personality. The 
main task is to recognize the differences among team members and to work with 
the team members, rather than have them work against the team. 
 
We will consider just two personality models from the many typologies that 
are available. The first, which has the advantage of simplicity, is called DISC, 
which is an acronym for: Dominance, Influencing, Steadiness, and Compliance. It 
parallels the writings of the Greek Hippocrates who established some terms in 370 
BC for four temperaments: Sanguine, Choleric, Phlegmatic, and Melancholic. 
Plato in 340 BC also identified and labelled 4 categories: Guardian, Artisan, 
Scientist and Philosopher (McShane and Travaglioine, 2003). The second model is 
that based on Jungian theory and adopted by Isabel Myers and Katharine Briggs 
for their MBTI model, which now comes under other guises such as Keirseyâs 
Temperament Sorter (Keirsey, 1998).  
DISC behavioural styles 
DISC follows a theory developed by Dr W.M. Marston in 1928 and further 
developed in the 1940s (Cole and Tuzinski, 2003). This theory suggests that a 
personâs preferred behavioural style falls into one of four categories. Although all 
four styles will usually be displayed by a single person, one style tends to describe 
the person's behaviour better than the others. DISC does not measure skills, 

158 
Engineering Planning and Design 
 
experience, values, intelligence, beliefs or knowledge. DISC behavioural styles are 
shown in Table 6.4. 
 
Table 6.4 DISC behavioural styles.

Direct Style 
D: Direct, Dominant, Doer 
I: Influencer, Inspired, Persuader 
Indirect Style 
C: Conscientious, Cautious, 
Critical 
S: Steady, Supporter, Stable 
 
 
The four styles are determined from whether behaviour is direct or indirect 
and whether behaviour is oriented towards tasks and results, or people and ideas. 
All styles are necessary and valuable. The descriptors help us to clarify differences 
in people and remove barriers to improve communication. By determining whether 
another person is direct or indirect, task-oriented or people-oriented, one can 
develop a better relationship and better communication with that person. Tests that 
can be used to assess behavioural style can be found on the Internet so that an 
allocation to one of Direct (Eagle), Influencing (Parrot), Supportive (Dove) and 
Conscientious (Owl) can be made. 
Direct style? Faster or slower paced 
Some people are direct and work quickly, take risks, are forceful, talkative and 
tend to make decisions quickly. The Dominant Director and Influencing Persuasive 
types fit into the category of direct styles, as shown in Fig. 6.3. The indirect styles 
are quieter, patient, cooperative, more cautious and easy-going.  
 
 
Figure 6.3 DISC Personality types and their simple characteristics. 
 
 
 
They are good listeners and tend to take their time in making decisions and 
take fewer risks. Examples of indirect types include the Supporter and 
Conscientious styles.

People and ideas or tasks and results? 
People who are relationship-oriented are generally open, appreciative and 
supportive, and find it easy to make friends. These people can be enthusiastic and 
can share their feelings. They tend to go with the flow in a relaxed manner. The 
Steady Supporter (S) and Influencing (I) styles stress people and ideas. They tend 
to promote harmony. The other types of people seem to be biased to task and 
results. This type likes structure, procedures, guidelines and facts. They prefer to 
get to the point and do not like their time wasted. They usually take a considerable 
time to show their warm side and tend to keep their feelings to themselves.  
 
Note that no one operates entirely in one quadrant and we all tend to have a 
mixture of all the styles in different percentages. Each style has weaknesses and it 
is important to be aware of our own weaknesses so that we can improve in those 
areas. One style will be the dominant style of an individual, although in different 
situations other styles may well be used. Is the dominant style Direct or Indirect? Is 
there a preference for tasks and results, or people and ideas? Are people who have 
similar or different characteristics easier to get along with? Why?  
Eagle (Direct) 
The eagle personality is decisive and strong willed. Eagles are keen to get to the 
point and quickly. They are adventurous, take risks and are forceful. At work 
eagles are results orientated, but to be easier to work with, eagles should do more 
listening and improve their consideration of others. In various other typologies, this 
personality has been labelled as a Bear, Lion, Guardian and Controller. 
Parrot (Influencing) 
The parrot is enthusiastic and likes to express emotions. Parrots are talkative, 
optimistic and confident. In groups they are persuasive and gregarious. Parrots 
need to pay more attention to detail and improve their follow-through on tasks. In 
various other typologies, this personality has been labelled as a Monkey, Otter, 
Artisan and Promoter. 
Dove (Supportive) 
The dove is dependable, diplomatic, patient and a team player. Doves like to get 
results, are stable, good listeners and are sincere and patient. However, they could 
work at coping with change and improve their decision-making ability. In various 
other typologies, this personality has been labelled as a Dolphin, Golden Retriever, 
Philosopher and Supporter. 
Owl (Conscientious) 
The owl personality is orderly, cautious and reserved. Owls have high standards, 
are careful, analytical, diplomatic and accurate. They could, however, open up 
more and attempt to move out of their comfort zone if they are to make more 
impact on their team. In various other typologies, this personality has been labelled 
as a Beaver, Scientist and Analyst.

Myers-Briggs type indicator 
In 1920 Carl Jung theorised that people were all different, having various degrees 
of four characteristic functions: Thinking, Feeling, Sensation and Intuition, and 
two attitudes: Introversion and Extraversion (Jung, 1923). He proposed that 
peopleâs psychological orientation was formed by a dynamic mix of attitudes and 
functions. Isabel Myers used Jung's typology to establish a procedure for 
determining personality type in individuals and added the dimension of Judging 
and Perceiving to Jungâs original typology. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator 
(MBTI) was developed from decades of research by accumulating information on 
individualsâ behaviour and attitudes of people in all spheres of work and life. The 
MBTI made available the theory of Jung to a much wider audience and was 
popularised through the 1980s and 1990s and is now embedded in many 
organisational management programs. A modified version has been developed by 
Keirsey and Bates (1984) and Keirsey (1998). Boeree (2004) has reviewed the 
work of Jung and has developed a questionnaire to map the elements of the MBTI 
as well, and this is freely available on the Internet.  
 
The test has four scales. The first is the Extroversion (E) â Introversion (I). 
This scale demonstrates how we interact with others. Overall about 50 percent of 
the population is extroverted and 50 percent introverted.  
 
The second scale is Sensing (S) - Intuiting (N) with approximately 73 percent 
of the general population sensing and 27 percent intuitive. This scale shows our 
preference for how we deal with understanding the world either through step-by-
step approaches, or through using vision and insight. A sensing person tends to 
assimilate a series of facts in a linear fashion, while the intuiting person absorbs the 
same information through conceptual jumps and development of patterns from 
abstractions. The S types dislike solving new problems without prior experience on 
how to solve them. On the other hand, the N types prefer to solve new problems 
and dislike carrying out the same thing over and over again. Of course, people tend 
to share both sets of qualities to some extent. 
 
Thinking (T) - Feeling (F) is the third scale and these functions are 
distributed in a proportion 40 percent thinking and 60 percent feeling, with 60 
percent of men being thinking types, while 70+ percent of women are feeling 
types. This scale is related to how we make decisions. This is the only scale that 
has a gender bias.  
 
The last scale is Judging - Perceiving (J-P) and was included by Myers and 
Briggs to help determine the superior function of an individual. Judging people 
tends to be more cautious, whereas Perceiving people generally tends to be more 
spontaneous.  
 
The Judging â Perceiving continuum also determines the superior function. 
Those people who have a "J" and are extroverts have the superior function on the 
thinking feeling continuum. Alternatively, extroverted and "P" means that the 
superior function is on the sensing feeling scale. An introvert deemed to be judging 
will have the superior function of senser or intuiter, while an introvert with 
perceiving will be superior on the thinking feeling scale. It has been found that J 
and P types are approximately evenly distributed throughout the population. 
 
One function from each continuum is combined to identify a type represented 
by four letters such as ESTJ. Table 6.5 shows the various types for the general 
population and Table 6.6 the various types for engineers. The tables could be rolled 

Management Processes and Skills 
161 
 
to make a cylinder which puts ISTP and INTP side by side and ESTJ and ENTJ 
side by side. We are more likely to favour the adjacent styles when not operating 
out of the main style. Each of the functions is a continuum, so situations will 
determine how much along that continuum we are likely to be. 
 
Tables 6.5 and 6.6 suggest  that engineers have a different personality profile 
from the general population and we find that most engineers are driven by thoughts 
and ideas, make decisions based on logic and facts, and tend to be organised and 
punctual (STJs). On the other side of the table, there are the more creative NTs 
who like to solve new problems, have an insight into the future and do not like 
routine. As with all these groupings, it is necessary to appreciate that different 
people see things differently, make decisions differently, interact with others 
differently and have different preferences.

Diversity â an important dimension of a team 
"We know that a group of intelligent, motivated men and women of many different 
backgrounds and experiences makes an ideal engineering team. These individuals 
will see the world through different eyes and bring unique perspectives to the 
engineering task at hand. Their diversity will yield a diversity of solutions, which 
ultimately leads to the best solution." â Dean of Engineering, University of Illinois 
at Urbana-Champaign (quoted in Daniel, 2002). 
 
When people talk of diversity, it is common to classify differences into a 
number of categories. These are 
 
ï· 
professional - level of expertise, career stage; 
ï· 
demographic - gender, age, nationality, language; 
ï· 
psychodynamic - attitudes, personality type, sexual orientation; 
ï· 
physiological - energy level, health; and 
ï· 
world view - values, tendency to prejudice, tendency to bias, ethics stance.
 
As an example, the Adelaide Car Component Company had a workforce with 
the following statistics: 
 
ï· 
1160 employees; 
ï· 
58 managers, 161 professionals, 80 sales and service, 861 on shop floor; 
ï· 
71 percent male, 29 percent female; and 
ï· 
52 ethnic groups. 
One would expect diversity based on professional, 
demographic, psychodynamic, physiological and world view â in fact over all 
categories. There is a tremendous potential here for great things (and for 
disasters!). A characteristic of teams with diversity is that they are susceptible to 
splitting into subgroups along gender, ethnic or other dimensions (Lau and 
Murnighan, 1998), but they do have the capability of having a great synergy to get 
better solutions to problems. 
6.6 GROUP AND TEAM DEVELOPMENT 
Many common-sense strategies for working in groups are now discussed and, if 
used in conjunction with knowledge of the stages of team development, can assist 
in moving the team forward. 
Getting to know other group members 
This appears to be elementary, but many groups never get to know the other team 
members. Generally, different team members have very different values, 
motivations, abilities and personalities. The first thing to do as a group is to make 
sure everybody introduces themselves. Make sure everyone has written down all 
other membersâ names. Suggest that everyone uses each personâs name once at the 
initial meeting. Many people will immediately forget names if heard once or never 
quite hear them the first time. Ensure that everyone gets each otherâs name (and do 
not be afraid to ask for the spelling). Following this, get to know what they like 
doing, where they are from, show interest and generally find out about them. Some 
members will be totally involved and others will be apathetic if they are allowed to 

Management Processes and Skills 
163 
 
be. Try not to let people remove themselves from the group because they then 
become dead weight, leading to frustration and resentment in some group 
members.  
 
Something that is hard to accept is that when team members do not 
participate it is not entirely their fault. It is also the fault of the leader and all other 
team members. One cannot be responsible for all team members all the time but 
some simple skills will enable fuller participation by all. 
 
Our style and approach is adapted to the situation, depending on whom we 
are dealing with; from being patient to being very direct. The key to our 
understanding is knowing those we are dealing with, and learning to change our 
individual style so that better understanding is achieved. While each person has a 
dominant style of interaction it can be advantageous to understand each othersâ 
styles and to adapt when necessary. Keep a watch on the process and practise this 
skill. 
 
From the MBTI we know that approximately 50 percent of people are 
introverted. These people find it against their nature to immediately talk in a group 
situation as they find it stressful. They tend to think things through before talking. 
Some people consider others' feelings and will not tell them when they have made 
mistakes. In a group with many extroverts, the introverted person will find it 
difficult to participate. To speak up to gain attention is not in his or her nature. It is 
the extrovertâs responsibility to make an effort to include the introvert, to not 
dominate the conversation with them, and to not take the floor away from them. If 
the team wants to succeed, the team must actively manage the process of inclusion 
of others.  
Stages in team development  
When teams come together to undertake a specific task, it has been found that they 
tend to go through a series of quite well-defined stages. In 1965, Tuckman 
developed a model that had four stages of forming, norming, storming and 
performing. Some stages are very productive, some less so. It is important to 
realise that this is standard behaviour and that, if one is part of a group, these are 
the different stages that should be expected to happen and need to be worked 
through. Two extra stages of pre-group and adjourning can be added, as shown in 
Figure 6.4 and described below. 
Stage 1 â Pre-group 
At this stage the task is usually broadly defined, the group is undefined, the 
resources are undefined and there might appear to be little that anyone can do. 
However, there is. Members can decide on commitment at this early stage, and 
show it by, for example, arriving on time, or behaving in a way that demonstrates 
their willingness to be part of the group.  
Stage 2 â Forming 
As the groups are formed, inclusion or exclusion is of paramount importance as 
members try to work out their place in the group. There may be superficial 
conversation and people orientate to each other and the task. It is suggested that 

164 
Engineering Planning and Design 
 
even at this early stage there will be a search for direction and people will be 
looking for someone to provide strong leadership. The culture of the group is 
established during this stage. When teams are beginning, each member considers 
his or her identity within the group. Identity can be considered to be a combination 
of personality, behaviour, competencies, and position in the social structure of the 
group (Borgatti, 2002). Certain members will fight for dominance, others will like 
to be seen as being smart, others will play a comedian role, and some just want to 
be liked. Knowing Belbinâs roles helps a team through this stage by allowing the 
preferred styles of individuals to be incorporated in planning roles for the group by 
the leader.  
 
 
Figure 6.4 Stages of group development. 
Stage 3 â Storming 
Once the initial nerves are overcome, it is time for people to be confident enough 
to cause trouble! There may be the first conflict with personal agendas revealed. 
The interactions between members may be quite uneven and there is the tendency 
to rebel against the leader. The interactions allow a pecking order to be established. 
It is important to resolve conflict, otherwise apathy can set in, and doubts may 
surface about the ability to cope with the task. 
Stage 4 â Norming  
Following the early disruptions, there may emerge a sense of renewed hope. 
Members can become more tolerant of each other and cohesion increases, and 
harmony becomes important. The roles of the members are established and they 
can become less dependent on the leader, although the leader is still necessary. 
Stage 5 â Performing 
The group then enters its most productive phase. Members âget on with the jobâ, 
although minor problems may still occur. The role of the leader has changed and 
he or she is now seen as a peer and resource person. The roles have all been 
determined and there is consolidation of the status hierarchy.

Stage 6 â Adjourning 
The final stage of the team is its disbandment. As things wind down, there is time 
to check that the goals have been achieved and to try and cope with the end of the 
group. Many will make plans for future meetings and there may even be some 
sadness. Most importantly, there will often be a level of excitement based on what 
was achieved. 
 
As teams evolve, if new members join the group, there is a tendency to revert 
to an earlier stage of development. This can be seen in Figure 6.4 where a number 
of cycles are generally needed, especially if all members do not attend meetings or 
carry out the work allocated to them. It is important that teams assess their 
performance from time to time. Most teams start out well, and then drift away from 
their original goals and eventually fall apart. This is less likely to happen if, from 
time to time, the team facilitator or leader asks everyone how they are feeling 
about the team, and does a public check of the performance of the team against the 
mission/vision statement.  
6.7 TEAM MEETING SKILLS  
The skills required by an engineer are many and varied. These include the 
management of time and people. Managing people requires the manager to know 
his or her inner workings. Once an individual knows how others see him or her and 
how he or she interact with others, he or she will become better in leading groups 
and teams. Managing the resources that are available is paramount for any engineer 
carrying out projects. The ability to facilitate meetings and to manage oneâs own 
time are two skills that are part of being an efficient manager and leader. Meetings 
can be useless if there is no control of the discussion. 
Effective Meetings 
To have effective meetings, it is important to set an agenda, start and finishing 
times, the location for the meeting and ensure the chairperson keeps control of the 
process and time schedule. One simple thing that helps a lot is having an agenda. 
Brainstorming sessions have their own format. Meetings should have a designated 
outcome but if the meeting is just for a one-way distribution of information, this 
can be done prior to the meeting and the agenda set for discussion. Some simple 
processes are 
 
A  
Attendees assign a chairperson who should encourage active participation 
to have the best possible decision-making process. Remember the meeting is for 
the benefit of all attendees. Listen to other points of view and do not be afraid to 
offer your own opinions.  
 
G 
Group dynamics are important to allow all members to have a say. Ensure 
quieter members contribute, as they often have excellent ideas. Be firm with 
dominators who talk all the time, not allowing others to contribute. Remember the 
goals of the meeting.

Engineering Planning and Design 
 
E  
Expected outcomes are achieved by explaining the purpose of the meeting, 
exploring ideas and allowing all members to contribute to the discussion. Each 
member should feel that a contribution is expected and will be valued. 
 
N 
Note-taking for an accurate record of the meeting is essential. This is a 
skill to practise and apply in meetings. The more that one does note-taking, the 
more adept one becomes at it. Rotating the position of the official recorder of the 
meeting is important for all members to get experience. 
 
D 
Designate an action against each item. Decide "who is doing what" by 
what date so that everyone is clear on what is required. Create an action list. 
 
A 
Announce and advise what is on the designated Action list, by circulating 
the minutes of the meeting as soon after the meeting is completed and set the next 
agenda, including time and place! The first item on any agenda should be a âstatus 
check,â which is where the facilitator asks each person how things are going and 
whether actions have been undertaken and, more importantly, whether there is 
anything that needs to be discussed. 
 
 
As an individual attending a meeting, check the contribution that can be 
made by asking: Should this be a brainstorming session? See guidelines on 
brainstorming and creativity in Chapter 4. What preparation is required for the 
meeting? Has the work that has been allocated on the action list been completed? 
Are there other members who were not at the meeting who need to be involved? 
 
Some goals that successful chairpersons try to undertake are to establish the 
vision in conjunction with the group; ensure the team focus on the task; actively 
pursue participation from all members of the team; protect individuals from direct 
personal attack and establish conflict resolution strategies; suggest alternative 
processes when the team is stalled; and summarize and clarify the team's decisions. 
The chairperson accomplishes these goals by doing the following:  
 
ï· 
Stays neutral and ensures that good seating arrangements are used (e.g., best in 
a circle); 
ï· 
Keeps the meeting on time, even if it is going well (or people will try to avoid 
coming next time); 
ï· 
Expresses out loud what seems to be happening (e.g., âGeorge and Paul (in a 
side conversation) can you please give your opinion on the issue at handâ; 
"nobody seems to be saying much since Belinda suggested ... "); 
ï· 
Ensure conflicts, snide remarks and put-downs are addressed immediately to 
help foster a team spirit even referring the perpetrators to reading material on 
group behaviours; and 
ï· 
after a person has not contributed for a while, ask for his or her opinion. 
 
 
Most importantly, before it is decided that a meeting needs to take place, 
examine if there is a better method to achieve a similar outcome. Email, telephone 
and/or video-conferencing may be more efficient alternatives.

Handling conflict in teams 
Too much conflict may be a bad thing, but some is considered good because it may 
lead to more ideas being considered. The important issue in conflict is to ensure it 
is controlled and does not get out of hand. Correct decisions need to be taken if a 
wrong engineering decision will lead to a bad outcome, even if this is bad for team 
morale. This is not as easy as it sounds because there are many sources of conflict, 
many different situations in which it occurs and therefore many different ways of 
handling it. The five ways of handling conflict shown in Figure 6.5 depend on the 
behaviour and attitude of the person causing the conflict, and the managerial style 
of the person attempting to resolve it. These will now be discussed in a little more 
detail. 
Coercion 
With coercion the leader essentially imposes his or her will on the person who has 
caused the conflict. It is a power-orientated approach and is useful if quick action 
is needed, or for unpopular decisions. While it works well in these situations, it 
may cause problems later because, although quashed at the moment, the conflict 
may not be resolved and the losers may become angry because there is competition 
for their own concerns. At this point, a negotiated resolution becomes less likely. 
 
 
Figure 6.5  Conflict types and resolution strategies (adapted from Thomas, 1976). 
Accommodation 
In accommodation, an unassertive leader works with a cooperative team member. 
Both neglect their own needs to suit others (to a certain extent). It is a useful 
conflict strategy if a team needs to preserve harmony, or when one of the two 
realises he or she is wrong. It has the advantage in that it allows others to learn by 
their mistakes, and is useful in building credit for later. On the down side, because 
they have given way, the feeling of self-worth may be diminished, and winners 
may press for further domination.

Avoidance 
Conflict from an uncooperative team member can also be handled by avoiding the 
issues altogether. Avoidance does not address the conflict directly but sidesteps 
and attempts to postpone any resolution. As a strategy, avoidance is useful when 
the issue is trivial, or the leaderâs power is low. It may also be applicable when the 
potential damage is greater than the benefits of resolution, or if there is a need to 
allow people to cool off. On the other hand, it generally gives low satisfaction and 
may even increase the opponentâs frustration. 
Compromise 
Compromise seeks a mutually acceptable solution to the problem, or at least a 
temporary solution. It can be used where two opponents have equal power, or to 
achieve a temporary settlement in complex matters, or when goals are only 
moderately important. The main disadvantages with it are that the conflict is 
thought likely to re-emerge, and both sides may be dissatisfied with the outcome. 
Collaboration 
If there is time, working together using successful negotiating behaviours can bring 
an excellent result to conflict. Collaboration can be used to find a solution when 
both partiesâ concerns are too important to ignore, to maximise commitment, and 
when it is important to learn from others. It can, however, take time and energy to 
work through it. 
 
 
Elephants and ants analogy for choosing priorities 
 
If ants were on the menu for dinner, how many would be needed for a feed? A great 
many! A lot of hunting would be required. On the other hand, if an elephant was on 
the menu for dinner how many would be needed? One would satisfy everyoneâs 
appetite. 
The activities that we perform in our daily lives can be related to the elephants 
and ants analogy. When work is about killing ants there is a confusion of activity 
with accomplishment. What kind of sustenance would be obtained from a large 
number of ants? Choosing to carry out easy small tasks is done because they can 
be done quickly, so as to achieve the illusion that a lot has been accomplished, 
when in reality productivity has been poor. One falls further and further behind 
because the elephant hunting has been overlooked. 
 
Elephant hunting or focussing on high payoff activities leads to productivity 
in the longer term. If one is busy stomping ants all day long, then the elephants will 
be totally ignored. 
If the situation exists of constantly being busy, spending time answering 
unimportant emails or dealing with minor interruptions, then there is a need to 
change from these âant stomping tasksâ to work on higher payoff activities. The ants 
still need to be dealt with but at a lower priority and with less time allocation. Try to 
spend 
less time 
with ants 
each day.

Activity with 
Accomplishment. (Adapted from Vance, 1993)

6.8 PERSONAL TIME MANAGEMENT SKILLS 
Vilfredo Pareto (1848-1923), an economist, made the well-known observation in 
1906 that 20 percent of the population owned 80 percent of the property in Italy 
which was later generalised into the so-called Pareto Principle (for many 
phenomena, 80 percent of consequences stem from 20 percent of the causes). This 
principle was further generalised in 1937 by Joseph Juran (1904-2008), the quality 
management guru of the 20th Century. Applied to time management, this translates 
to 20 percent of the time being expended on âthe vital fewâ situations or problems 
to account for 80 percent of the results.  
 
People can waste much time if they do not have direction or know how to 
recognise what is important. Time is irreversible and can never be regained. 
Engineering managers and leaders have many demands in any one day, and 
therefore time is required to be managed to ensure effective use of it. 
 
Vance (1993) emphasises the need to focus on important activities rather than 
activities which just keep everyone busy and being reactive to distractions or 
so-called urgent needs. This is also the basic premise of Covey (1989) in âThe 
Seven Habits of Highly Effective Peopleâ. The quick way to improve work 
productivity, family and social activities is to identify the 20 percent of the 
activities that will reap 80 percent of the benefits. It is necessary to reduce the time 
allocated to activities which give us small benefits, the so-called âantsâ. Table 6.7 
lists some possible time wasters suggested by Richards (1982).

Procrastination 
One must overcome the state of mind that is procrastination, which is the delaying 
of planned activities. What we have to do in most cases is just get startedâmake a 
plan and do it. Do not make excuses for putting off doing activities or even not 
planning to do them at all. Analyse how time is spent, for example, by jotting 
down what is done for a week for each quarter of an hour, and then implement a 
few methods to eliminate the identified bad habits that will gain the most time. 

170 
Engineering Planning and Design 
 
Rank these according to level of importance. Do this so that there are four groups 
of three activities. Once this has been done, undertake actions to operate on the top 
three as a priority, to help manage time. 
 
First of all, we need to allocate time to important tasks rather than urgent but 
unimportant tasks. This can be achieved by developing a plan with priorities which 
is updated along with a daily to-do list and weekly and monthly goals. To 
accomplish good time management needs self-discipline. This will require 
changing old habits and developing new ones. One has to be persistent in using the 
time saving hints developed in the time management plan. Once plans are put in 
place and gains in time have been achieved, the next areas for review can be 
considered. 
A Simple Time Management Plan 
Effective time management at work is crucial to accomplishing tasks and goals, so 
that there is personal time left for personal enjoyment. Organization and task focus 
are the primary requirements. There needs to be persistence and self-discipline, an 
awareness of overcoming procrastination and a long-term vision. 
 
ï· 
Plan activities. Take time to plan activities. It is important to allow time to 
plan wisely. Establish priorities for the day, the week, short-term, mid-term, 
and for the long-term. Dividing large tasks into a series of small manageable 
tasks will let the large task be easily accomplished. Each small task should 
have a deadline. 
ï· 
Set time aside to do high priority tasks. Maintain accurate calendars; abide 
by them and adjust priorities as a result of new tasks. This can be done by 
using checklists and to-do lists and in some cases doing the most difficult task 
first.  
ï· 
Do one task at a time, if possible. When starting a task, try to complete it 
before starting another task-this can be done by allocating enough time for the 
task.  
ï· 
Set start and stop times for activities. This will need estimates, but these 
will improve with practice. Challenge the theory, "Work expands to fill the 
allotted time." Therefore, establish deadlines for all tasks. Ensure meetings 
have a specified purpose, have a time limit, and include only essential people. 
Do not waste other people's time. 
ï· 
Do it, delegate it, and dump it. (Vance, 1993) Do not put unneeded effort 
into tasks and activities which do not require perfection. Handle 
correspondence quickly with short letters and memos. Save time for other 
activities. Learn to know when to stop a task, using the Pareto Principle. 
Delegate as much as possible and empower subordinates. Throw unneeded 
things away.  
ï· 
Learn to say no. By making the mistake of saying yes to too many things, 
priorities are then decided by others.  
ï· 
Avoid committing to unimportant activities, no matter when they are. Ask 
what can be planned for this time slot, such as a holiday, a weekend hiking or 
camping or a fun weekend with family. 

Management Processes and Skills 
171 
 
ï· 
Get Started. The classic time waster is avoiding starting a project. The most 
important item is to do it now. âA journey of a thousand miles starts with one 
step.â-Lao Tzu. The ability to start work quickly results in achievement and 
satisfaction. Five minutes now can achieve the start and the journey is begun. 
Give rewards for finishing tasks, as this tends to stop procrastination and helps 
starting. 
ï· 
Develop a routine to do certain tasks like answering emails when there is 
time but not the energy to do other tasks. Set aside time for reflection. 
 
Time ManagementâLong-Term Goals 
Keep long-term goals in sight. Have checklists with items such as: "department 
meeting at 2:00" and "ring so and so, write letter/memo onâ¦,â but ensure time is 
put aside for the relationship tasks. Other examples include: 
 
ï· 
meet with staff on a regular basis both formally (interviews) and informally 
(morning coffee at least once a week);  
ï· 
develop a plan for the organisation to use only recycled paper; 
ï· 
enroll to study Italian because in 4 years I want to be fluent because (insert 
your goal); and 
ï· 
exercise each day (e.g., at least 15 minutes walk no matter what the weather). 
 
 
Planning 
 
As a planner, memorising this poem of Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936) will assist in 
developing a focus on the crucial facets of any plan. In planning, responses need to 
be made to each of these questions. (Adair, 1986) 
 
I keep six honest serving-men 
  (They taught me all I knew); 
Their names are What and Why and When 
  And How and Where and Who. 
I send them over land and sea, 
  I send them east and west; 
But after they have worked for me, 
  I give them all a rest. 
 
 
 
(From The Elephantâs Child) 
 
 
 
Try not to get caught up in short-term demands which put pressure on things 
that are more important that one should be doing but cannot find the time for. 
Approximately 30 percent of items on the âto-do listâ should be long-range items 
that would normally be put aside for when there is enough time! These long-term 
goals are very much embedded in students earning a degree but also goals for 
fitness, exercise and sports, relaxation and enjoyment need to be developed. 
Spontaneity can be fun, but make sure that there is time available for the things 
which will enable long-term goals to be accomplished.

6.9 SUMMARY 
The resources of time, money, materials and people are used to make things 
happen. In this chapter the need to manage people and time has been addressed. 
First of all, learning how to manage oneself can make it easier to manage others. 
To manage others it is imperative that one manages oneself in a way that promotes 
the desire in others to do well. In this way teams and groups will achieve desired 
outcomes and some fun may be had along the way.  
 
As an engineer, you will not only work in groups and teams but in all 
likelihood take some form of leadership role as well, as many engineers rise to 
senior positions. The importance of knowing how these roles work and, more 
importantly, to know what to do when they start to break down cannot be stressed 
enough.  
 
It has been shown that effective time management is crucial to accomplishing 
tasks and goals as well as providing time for personal activities. 
 
PROBLEMS 
6.1 Write down five groups/teams that you have been part of in the last year and 
determine if they were really a group or a team. Is it possible to classify them 
easily or are there elements of both in some of them? 
 
6.2 Break into groups, as designated by lecturer. These can be groups of different 
sizes ranging from 3 to more than 10. Discuss âWhat are the important elements of 
having a successful meeting?â Prepare a set of hints for running meetings. 
 
6.3 Use the results of the personality test (http://www.keirsey.com/) to assess the 
attributes of the people in an engineering group project that you are involved in. 
What are the advantages of doing this in a formal way? 
 
6.4 Working with an engineering project group of which you are/were a member, 
list the range of diversity that the members exhibit. Take some care with this 
because, due to cultural differences, some may not be happy to discuss various 
aspects of themselves. You may find sexual orientation is one area that, quite 
reasonably, many are keen to avoid discussing, and this should be taken into 
account. 
 
6.5 In groups where you are involved through the year, make a careful observation 
of conflict and how it is resolved. Are there people who seem to always want to 
use the same resolution strategy no matter what the situation? Does this work? 
 
6.6 Irrespective of the nature of the conflict or the feelings of the leader, what 
strategies of conflict resolution might be appropriate for a problem that arises on 
the day before a report is due? 
 
6.7 Choose three of the leaders listed in Section 6.4, and find out what their main 
attributes of leadership were against the 10 leadership laws. 

Management Processes and Skills 
173 
 
 
6.8 Activity for group review: assess what might be going wrong in your team and 
think how to remedy it. 
 
How is the group functioning? 
 
Score from 1 to 7: 
1 is agree,  
4 is sometimes, 7 is 
disagree 
Group clarifying what the task or objective is  
 
Group continuously checking on progress against timeline 
and seeks reasons for non-compliance 
 
 
Group clarifying or recording what has been decided 
 
Group clarifying who is going to do what 
 
Group clarifying what has to be done by when 
 
Group establishing procedures for handling meetings  
 
Group keeping to agreed procedures 
 
All members listening to each other 
 
Not allowing individuals to dominate and others to withdraw 
 
Not compromising individual needs for the sake of the team 
 
Group recognising the feelings of members of the team 
 
Members contributing equally to the progress of the team 
 
 
Sum the 12 scores. A score of 12 would be perfect, 12 to 29 shows team is working 
well, 24 to 50 requires more effort, 50 to 84 would be disastrous and requires a 
meeting to change attitudes in the group.

APPENDIX 6A THE MBTI DESCRIPTIONS 
The following list comes from a number of sources including Keirsey and Bates 
(1978), Keirsey (1998) and Boeree (2004).  
  
ENFJ (Extroverted feeling with intuiting): Mikhail Gorbachev, Mao. These people 
are the conversationalists of the world. They tend to idealize their friends. They 
make good parents, but have a tendency to allow themselves to be used. They 
make good therapists, teachers, executives, and salespeople.  
ENFP (Extroverted intuiting with feeling): Leon Trotsky. These types of people 
love novelty and surprises and tend to be imaginative. They are big on emotions 
and expression. They tend to find reasons to do whatever they want. They tend to 
improvise rather than spend time preparing. They are good at sales, advertising, 
politics, and acting.  
ENTJ (Extroverted thinking with intuiting): Bill Gates, Margaret Thatcher, 
Napoleon Bonaparte. In charge at home, they expect a lot from spouses and kids. 
They like organization and structure and tend to make good executives and 
administrators.  
ENTP (Extroverted intuiting with thinking): Richard Feynman, Walt Disney and 
Nikola Tesla. These are lively people and tend to be outspoken, not humdrum or 
orderly. As mates, they are a little dangerous, especially economically. They are 
good at analysis and make good entrepreneurs. They do tend to play at one-
upmanship.  
ESFJ (Extroverted feeling with sensing): Michael Palin. These people like 
harmony. They tend to be very active committee members and work best with 
encouragement and praise. They may be dependent, first on parents and later on 
spouses. They wear their hearts on their sleeves and excel in service occupations 
involving personal contact.  
ESFP (Extroverted sensing with feeling): Picasso. Very generous and impulsive, 
they have a low tolerance for anxiety and are sometimes labelled as performers or 
artisans. These people like public relations, and they love the phone. They tend to 
know what is going on and join in eagerly.  
ESTJ (Extroverted thinking with sensing): Joseph Stalin, Harry S. Truman. These 
are responsible mates and parents and are loyal in the workplace. They are 
realistic, down-to-earth, orderly, and love tradition. The majority of engineers fall 
in this category. They often find themselves joining civic clubs!  
ESTP (Extroverted sensing with thinking): Theodore Roosevelt, Henry Ford. 
These are action-oriented people, often sophisticated, sometimes ruthless - our 
"James Bonds." As mates, they are exciting and charming, but they have trouble 
with commitment. They make good promoters, entrepreneurs, and con artists.  
INFJ (Introverted intuiting with feeling): Carl Gustav Jung, Mahatma Gandhi. 
These are serious students and workers who really want to contribute. They are 
private and easily hurt. They make good spouses, but tend to be physically 
reserved. People often think they are psychic. They make good therapists, general 
practitioners and ministers.  
INFP (Introverted feeling with intuiting): Albert Schweitzer, Audrey Hepburn. 
These people are idealistic, self-sacrificing, and somewhat cool or reserved. They 

Management Processes and Skills 
177 
 
are very family and home oriented, but do not like to relax. These people are found 
in psychology, architecture, and religion, but never in business.  
INTJ (Introverted intuiting with thinking): Stephen Hawking, Dwight Eisenhower, 
Isaac Asimov. These are the most independent of all types. They love logic and 
ideas and are drawn to scientific research. They can be rather single-minded.  
INTP (Introverted thinking with intuiting): Albert Einstein, Marie Curie. Faithful, 
preoccupied, and forgetful, these are the bookworms. They tend to be very precise 
in their use of language. They are good at logic and mathematics and make good

ISFJ (Introverted sensing with feeling): Mother Teresa. These people are service 
and work oriented. They may suffer from fatigue and tend to be attracted to 
troublemakers. They are good nurses, teachers, secretaries, general practitioners, 
librarians, middle managers, and housekeepers.  
ISFP (Introverted feeling with sensing): Mozart, Auguste Rodin. They tend to be 
shy and retiring, not talkative, but like sensuous action. They can be good at 
painting, drawing, sculpting, composing, dancing and they like nature. They are 
not big on commitment.  
ISTJ (Introverted sensing with thinking): John D. Rockefeller. These people are 
dependable pillars of strength. They often try to reform their mates and other 
people. They make good bank examiners, auditors, accountants, tax examiners, 
supervisors in libraries and hospitals, business and boy or girl scouts! Engineers 
are a greater proportion than average in this category.  
ISTP (Introverted thinking with sensing): Michael Jordan, Lance Armstrong. 
These people are action-oriented and fearless, and crave excitement. They are 
impulsive and dangerous to stop. They often like tools, instruments, and weapons, 
and often become technical experts. They are not interested in communication and 
are often incorrectly diagnosed as dyslexic or hyperactive.

CHAPTER SEVEN  
Communication 
 
Effective communication is needed in all facets of engineering work. In 
undertaking a project, engineers have to listen to and understand others, question 
and discuss ideas, give feedback, write reports, take an active part in meetings, 
engage in conflict resolution, and develop and manage teams. In order to 
communicate effectively with others, it is necessary to be able to present 
information clearly and simply and to interpret the words, emotions and non-
verbal messages of others. This chapter discusses the nature of, and strategies for, 
achieving effective and clear communication. 
7.1 INTRODUCTION 
Communication is the process by which humans interact with each other. 
Language, both written and spoken, enables us to develop ideas and plans, and 
then to communicate them to others. Language and communication together make 
social interaction possible. Without them, there would no society and it would be 
impossible to engage in engineering work. Communication is the basic ability of 
humans to make and interpret vocal utterances to make known their needs, wants, 
ideas and feelings, and to change these spoken words into written records for 
posterity; that make us different from other animals on earth. 
 
Human beings have many channels of communication available to them. Like 
other animals, they can employ all of their five senses to communicate; however, 
social communication occurs predominantly through the use of eyes, ears and 
voice. For example, in face-to-face inter-personal communication between two 
people, one listens and watches while the other speaks, until the roles change. 
However, the message sent out by the speaker is not contained solely in the words 
used. Non-verbal communication also takes place, both intentionally and 
unintentionally, through the speakerâs hand movements and facial expressions. The 
tone of voice, independently of the words used, can also transmit information. 
Likewise, the listener sends non-verbal messages back to the speaker, intentionally 
and unintentionally, through facial expressions which may contain a variety of 
signals such as agreement or disagreement, confusion, disbelief and non-
comprehension. This is an instance of feedback. Various channels of 
communication are thus used to send information back and forth, even in this most 
common of situations.  
 
Interpersonal communication can also take place through other channels that 
employ sight, with or without sound. For example, written notes and letters can be 
transmitted by post or by email, or even by carrier pigeon. Devices such as 
telephone, the internet, radio and television provide other potential communication 

182

channels. Throughout history, humans have devised a wide range of ingenious 
ways to communicate with each other using sight and sound to overcome the 
barriers of both space and time. 
 
In the discussion to date we have focused on a specific form of 
communication involving two people. There are obviously other possibilities and 
various forms of communication to consider. Perhaps the simplest is self 
communication, which occurs, for example, when we talk to ourselves or write 
notes and messages to ourselves as reminders of things we want to remember and 
to record information we need to keep. The case of person-to-person 
communication has already been discussed. In group communication more than 
two people talk and listen to each other. It may be that everyone in the group 
speaks; alternatively, several may speak while the others listen. Meetings allow 
direct communication to occur in a group of people. Group communication can 
also occur through indirect channels such as written messages. In mass 
communication one or several people send messages to large numbers of people. In 
modern society, mass communication typically occurs through television, radio 
and the Internet. The communication in such circumstances is often one-way, in 
that the receivers do not have any opportunity to send messages back to the 
senders. There is often no feedback in such situations. Feedback can play an 
important role in communication: it provides one means for checking whether the 
message received is the same as the one sent. Mass communication can also take 
place through books, newspapers and other printed documents. An instance of 
mass communication occurs when a lecturer makes a presentation to an audience, 
with or without visual aids, in a hall. A play, staged in a theatre, is yet another form 
of mass communication. In the last-mentioned instances, it is interesting to reflect 
on the extent to which feedback can occur. 
 
In human communication, the message that is sent is not always the same as 
the one received. Poor communication and miscommunication can occur in many 
ways. The fault may be that the original message is ambiguous or misleading. 
Alternatively, the error may be in a misreading of the received message. Messages 
can also be distorted and corrupted during the process of transmission, perhaps as a 
result of the channels used to send the messages. Non-verbal messages are 
susceptible to misinterpretation. Some people seem to be naturally good and 
effective communicators and almost always get their message across. Others do 
not communicate clearly and effectively, even in the simplest circumstances. Some 
people are good listeners, others less so. Depending on the channel of 
communication used, the message can become distorted during transmission.  
 
In all forms of successful human communication, irrespective of the channels 
employed, there must be at least one person sending information (the sender) and 
at least one person receiving the information (the receiver). Some of the problems 
of communication are illustrated in the model shown in Figure 7.1, where there are 
two parties who send and receive information in turn. Each message is encoded 
and sent using voice (words and tones), eyes and body language, but is susceptible 
to noise which may result in loss of clarity and distortion. The noise depends on 
the channel used for communicating. When received, the message is decoded. The 
presence of noise, coupled with the possibility of faulty encoding and decoding, 
means that the message received may not be the same as the message sent. The  

Communication 
183

model stems from Shannonâs original model of communication in a telephone 
network (Shannon and Weaver, 1949). 
 
Communication plays a particularly important role in all engineering work. It 
dictates how problems are formulated and how they are solved. The quality of the 
communication among team members and between client and engineer determines 
the quality of engineering plans and design solutions. Good communication is 
necessary in order to carry good designs and plans through to successful 
implementation. Frequent and effective communication must occur among the 
members of any engineering team if it is to be successful. Lack of communication, 
poor communication and miscommunication in an engineering project can lead to 
catastrophe, as was the case in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster where 
different companiesâ management and NASA were told of critical safety indicators 
by engineers but allowed the Shuttle to be launched against many people's 
objections (Boisjoly, 2006). 
 
In engineering communication, whether direct or indirect, a great deal of 
information can be transmitted clearly and unambiguously through the use of 
sketches and drawings. These provide an added communication channel.

Experienced engineers, when talking to each other, usually resort to simple 
sketches to get their ideas across clearly. The ability to sketch and the conventions 
used in sketching are therefore of great importance to engineers. It is very 
important to learn these skills. Sketches and figures are also used in more formal 
channels of communications, such as reports, design drawings, plans, and even 
books, and lecture notes. Engineers must be able to communicate effectively in 
activities in order to 
 
ï· 
manage teams; 
ï· 
participate in team work; 
ï· 
counsel staff under their supervision; 
ï· 
give feedback to team members; 
ï· 
resolve conflicts among team members; 
ï· 
present concepts to other engineers; 
ï· 
present proposals to clients; 
ï· 
interact with the community in consultations and public meetings; and 
ï· 
prepare and describe clearly documents and design details.  
 
 
Good engineering is of necessity based on good and effective 
communication. Fortunately, the ability to communicate effectively can be learnt. 
Even those who are naturally good communicators should not rely on their native 
talents. In the following sections, various aspects of communication that are 
relevant to engineering work are discussed.  
7.2 PREPARING FOR COMMUNICATION 
One of the first and most important keys to successful communication is adequate 
preparation. Before an effective and successful engineering message can be sent, 
the content of the message has to be clearly worked out and fully understood by the 
sender. This is particularly important if the message is complex, which is often the 
case for engineers.  
 
Even when the content of the message has been worked out, it is necessary 
for the potential sender to put time and effort into choosing the best way in which 
to present the information so that the persons receiving the message will most 
easily understand it. In preparing for sending, it is important to evaluate the 
potential receivers, their backgrounds and expertise, and their level of 
understanding of the technical matters involved in the engineering message. For 
example, the communication of design information to non-specialist clients and the 
interested public will require a different form of presentation from that used for 
engineering colleagues who have a good technical understanding of the field. It 
may well be that a broad overview is better for non-specialists than detailed data 
which will not be understood.  
 
The sequencing of information also needs careful attention. While a logical 
sequence is usually preferable, it will not always be the best. A logical but long and 
complex argument can rapidly become boring and hence lead to inattention and 
misunderstanding.  
 

Communication

Methods for organising thoughts and for presenting ideas and concept. 
Before an idea can be communicated, it must be developed. There are a number of 
simple tools which can assist in the development of ideas, ranging from 
hierarchical lists, using word outline for ease of developing hierarchy, mind 
mapping, and picture and concept mapping (Buzan, 1988; Checkland, 1981; 
Horan, 2002). These methods advocate a systems approach to thinking by using 
images to link key ideas and hence enable transference of ideas between thinking 
and communicating. The mind mapping terminology was popularised by Buzan 
(1988) to be used for problem solving but also for learning, communicating and 
remembering. It appears that the future will include more tools for using these 
techniques, as Bill Gates (co-founder of Microsoft) stated that âa new generation of 
âmind-mappingâ software can also be used as a digital âblank slateâ to help connect 
and synthesize ideas and data â and ultimately create new knowledgeâ (Gates, 
2006). The basics of developing a mind map will now be discussed. 
Mind mapping 
A mind map is a graphical representation linking related ideas and concepts. It is 
created with a central image, word or concept that is under consideration. Around 
this central concept, up to 10 main ideas relating to this concept can be drawn or 
placed. Using Kiplingâs six question words is a simple method of beginning: 
What? Why? When? How? Where? and Who? Each of these images, words or 
concepts are considered and up to a further 10 main ideas or concepts which relate 
to each of them are generated. Without too much effort, a large number of related 
ideas can be produced. With this simple technique, it is possible to get a clear 
understanding of most problems.  
 
As an example of what is meant, a mind map that illustrates the concept of 
mind maps has been created using Free Mind software (2006). This is shown in 
Figure 7.2. Despite the fact that mind maps follow the way the brain is believed to 
work, mind mapping may initially seem to be an unnatural way to record or 
process information. Experience has shown that a little persistence pays off and 
people who use mind mapping find it a valuable tool that can be employed to assist 
in communication. These techniques can be an instrument in developing a systems 
approach to problem solving and most web pages store their information in a 
similar way, with links to relevant information being the cornerstone of the world 
wide web. 
 
One of the key reasons that mind mapping is so successful is that it forces the 
listener to not just record the points a speaker or article is making, but to engage 
with the speaker and to consider not just the importance of each point but also its 
relationship to the general theme or argument. This results in a deliberate sense of 
active listening or thinking that works the brain harder tending to produce greater 
understanding. Lazslo (2001) also noted that âThe full potential of human 
communication unfolds only when the communicators understand the strands of 
connection through which they communicateâ. To communicate at a high level 
requires people to make use of the different paths of communication that are 
available.  
 
Preparation for communication is not purely the task of the sender. The 
receiver also has preparatory work to do in order to ensure good reception. Even 

186 
Engineering Planning and Design 
 
when attending a meeting purely to listen and to obtain information, it is 
worthwhile planning for the event by thinking about what can be achieved and 
what information can be obtained. It is rare that the attendees at a meeting all have 
the same aims and agendas. With minimal preparation, it is easier to question 
speakers to obtain clarification and to ensure they provide the required 
information.  
 
 
Figure 7.2 A mind map of the concept of mind maps.  
 
 
Preparation is worthwhile prior to all communication. Probably the most 
important thing is to take sufficient time to organise yourself properly and develop 
techniques for storing information so that it can easily be found and retrieved. 
Being systematic is something that is well worth learning and developing. 
7.3 ACTIVE LISTENING  
People who are good listeners have a high success in getting the information they 
want from others. It has been suggested that they follow a process called active 
listening (Steinmetz, 1979). Active listening includes being encouraging, being 
reflective, probing for information, and using a summary technique. 
 
One way of being encouraging is to use open rather than closed questions. A 
closed question is one where the answer is either a single word or a short phrase. 
Closed question words include: Is, have, has, does, could, can, will, are and shall. 
For example: âHow old are you?â and âWhere do you live?â are closed questions. 
Closed questions have the following characteristics:

ï· 
they are quick and easy to answer; and 
ï· 
they enable the questioner to control the conversation. 
 
 
On the other hand, an open question is one that generally receives an 
extended answer. Open question words include: describe; what; why; and how. 
Thus âWhat do you think you will be doing in five years?â is an open question. 
Open questions have the following characteristics: 
 
ï· 
they ask the respondent to think and reflect; 
ï· 
they try to elicit opinions, knowledge and feelings; and  
ï· 
they deliver control of the conversation to the respondent. 
 
 
The open question gets the respondent thinking and giving useful information 
about himself or herself or the subject being discussed. Note: some question words 
can elicit either a short answer or a long answer depending on how they are 
phrased. Some examples of closed and open questions are given in Table 7.1. 
 
Table 7.1 Samples of closed and open questions.

Are you happy with the job?
What do you like or dislike about the 
job? 
 
Are you sad about the decision?
Describe your feelings about the 
decision? 
 
Do you like your manager?
How do you feel about your manager?
 
 
Once the open-ended question has been asked, an active listener will give 
free rein to the person answering and so encourage an uninhibited response. The 
aim is to get the responder to talk freely, and part of this freedom to talk involves 
the listener not talking. Silence can promote talking but so can non-verbal 
communication. Appropriate body motion should not to be distracting, artificial or 
forced. Movement, through the head, eyes, hands or any other body part which 
signals interest and attention, improves communication. Awareness of other 
peopleâs non-verbal communication is paramount for clear understanding. 
 
Reflective skills tend to help the listener keep track of the message. 
Reflecting skills improve the dialogue, by providing, as well as asking for, 
information. The most effective reflecting device is âparaphrasingâ. It serves to 
confirm that the person has been listening, but also requests more information. 
Paraphrasing helps to clarify a message or attempts to reflect the feelings of the 
speaker by summarising what has been said in fewer words.  
 
Applying active listening skills takes practice and people should beware of 
jumping to an incomplete picture of what others are talking about and then offering 
a master plan to solve the problems, without recognition of the thoughts, feelings 
and emotions of the person they are supposedly listening to. Rogers and Farson 
(1979) stress the importance of listening as âan important way to bring about 
changes in peopleâ. They suggest it involves three activities: listening for the full 

188 
Engineering Planning and Design 
 
meaning including both the content and the underlying emotions; responding to 
feelings (if the real message is an emotional one then the response should address 
that) and noting all the cues by observing the non-verbal messages. 
7.4 NON-VERBAL COMMUNICATION 
Non-verbal communication can be thought of as all the information transmitted 
other than the message contained in the actual words used. It includes both the 
visual element and the vocal tones (Samson and Daft, 2003). The face is used a 
great deal to transmit information and this is usually the first visual element 
noticed. People often notice the hand signals, shrugs, head movements and body 
movements but do not necessarily interpret the whole message. Non-verbal 
communication can be used for: 
 
ï· 
expressing emotion (e.g. smiling to show happiness); 
ï· 
conveying attitudes (e.g. staring, glaring to show aggression); and 
ï· 
demonstrating personality traits (e.g. open palms to show accepting qualities). 
 
 
Non-verbal behaviour varies across cultures, although the six emotions of 
anger, fear, disgust, sadness, happiness and surprise seem to prevail around the 
world. The ability to understand and use non-verbal communication is valuable for 
any workplace environment. Some non-verbal communication strategies are easier 
to use than others. For example, when going to a meeting or interview, the way a 
person dresses can portray a certain image. Other non-verbal communication 
strategies such as being punctual, animated and demonstrating friendliness by a 
smile are able to communicate an image about a person in a much more effective 
way than the spoken word. 
 
Facial expressions, eye movements, and head movements constitute a 
significant percentage of recognised non-verbal communication. This is because 
people tend to look at a personâs face and eyes when speaking with them. It is 
estimated that the human face can show more than 50,000 different expressions 
(Hamilton and Parker, 1990), and most people are able to interpret the meanings or 
feelings associated with many of the common ones, such as surprise, joy, 
suspicion, anger or menace. The skill to read small facial changes and eye 
movements requires greater observation and awareness but is useful to ensure that 
one obtains all the information being transmitted in a conversation.  
 
Being able to interpret body language and gestures is vital in establishing and 
maintaining good working relations with work colleagues and clients. If clients 
exhibit discomfort or unwillingness to participate, then it is possible to alter the 
environment and the communication strategy to help them feel more comfortable. 
It is doubly important to be aware what messages your own body language is 
sending, to avoid sending an incorrect or ambivalent message, and, more 
importantly, to ensure that you send the correct message. A useful strategy is to 
watch for reactions when speaking and then to try and spot contradictory messages 
when, for example, the voice says one thing and the body says another. This can 
indicate deception but one should always check this out by follow-up questions in 
the context of the conversation. A simple test can be performed to illustrate the 

Communication 
189 
 
importance of non-verbal communication: listen to someone with your eyes closed, 
then listen and watch. It should be evident that there are differences and that it is 
much easier to understand someone when you can see them. 
Non-verbal behaviour patterns for communication 
To deliver a greater impact when a person delivers a message, the use of non-
verbal behaviours will raise the level of interpersonal communication. The 
following material has been compiled from a variety of sources (Eunson, 1994; 
Hunt, 1979; James, 1995; Quilliam, Susan, 1995, Body Language, Carlton Books. 
Tidwell, 2005; Pease and Pease, 1999).  
 
One of the most important behaviour patterns involves eye contact. Eye 
contact signals interest in others and increases the speaker's credibility and helps to 
regulate communication flow. However, people should be aware of cultural 
differences. In Western countries people who make eye contact open the flow of 
communication and this shows interest and credibility. On the other hand, people 
from Japan, China, Africa, Latin American, and the Caribbean tend to avoid eye 
contact to show respect. Western cultures see direct eye-to-eye contact as positive 
but there are peculiarities even within a country. For example, in the United States 
African-Americans use more eye contact when talking and less when listening, 
with the reverse being true for Anglo-Americans. While a prolonged gaze is often 
interpreted as a sign of sexual interest, Arabic cultures use prolonged eye contact 
because they believe it indicates interest, and hence assists them in gauging the 
truthfulness of others. A person who does not reciprocate is seen as untrustworthy.  
 
Facial expressions, such as smiling, transmit friendliness, happiness, warmth, 
and a connotation of welcoming. People who smile frequently are perceived as 
more likable, friendly, warm and approachable. Smiling can be contagious and 
people tend to mirror smiling to gain rapport. They will be more comfortable and 
will want to listen more. It appears that facial expressions have similar meanings 
worldwide with respect to smiling, crying, or showing anger, sorrow, or disgust. 
Many Asian cultures suppress facial expression as much as possible. Many 
Mediterranean (Latino/Arabic) cultures openly express grief, whereas it has been a 
trait of men of English speaking cultures to hide grief or sorrow. Overall, there is a 
tendency for women to smile more than men, but in some groups such as African-
Americans there is little difference in the degree of smiling between genders. 
 
Gestures are a natural part of human communications and failing to make 
gestures while speaking may lead to a perception of the speaker being uninterested 
or boring. Congruent gestures with speaking capture the listener's attention, and 
facilitate understanding. It is impossible to list all gestures, but it is important to 
remember that what is acceptable in oneâs own culture may be offensive in 
another. Some cultures are restrained in gestures while others are animated, with 
the consequence that the restrained cultures feel the animated cultures lack 
manners. On the other hand, animated cultures often feel restrained cultures lack 
emotion. The use of hands for pointing or counting differs from country to country. 
For example, in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia pointing is 
done with the index finger, whereas in Germany the little finger is used. The 
Japanese prefer to use the entire hand (in fact, most Asian cultures consider 
pointing with the index finger to be rude).  

190 
Engineering Planning and Design 
 
 
Posture and body orientation can also be used for communication. Standing 
erect and leaning forward communicates to listeners that the speaker is 
approachable, receptive and friendly. Interpersonal closeness results when the 
speaker and listener face each other. Speaking with the back turned or looking at 
the floor or ceiling should be avoided as it communicates lack of interest. There are 
also cultural differences for a range of what might appear to be quite common 
actions. In Japan and Korea, bowing shows rank and is a sign of respect. Slouching 
is considered rude in most Northern European countries. Standing with hands in 
pockets is disrespectful in Turkey. Sitting with legs crossed is offensive in Ghana 
and Turkey, but traditional in Korea. Showing the soles of the feet is offensive in 
Thailand, Malaysia, and Saudi Arabia. 
 
Proximity, the distance between speaker and listener, is a key area where 
problems can occur. Cultural norms dictate a comfortable distance for interaction 
with others and people should look for signals of discomfort caused by invading 
other peopleâs space. Some of these signs are rocking, leg swinging, tapping, and 
gaze aversion. The context is also important: what is perfectly acceptable on a 
crowded train or bus is not acceptable in a normal business meeting. In Arab 
cultures, invasion of space and to stare closely into the eyes is considered normal. 
 
Although speaking is the essence of verbal communication, it can also have 
non-verbal aspects to it. The way the words are spoken, through such aspects as 
tone, pitch, rhythm, volume and inflection can have an important effect on the 
message being transmitted. One of the major criticisms of many speakers is that 
they speak in a monotonic voice, thus appearing to be boring and dull to listeners.  
 
Touch is generally culturally determined, with each culture having a clear 
concept of what parts of the body one may touch or not touch. Touch generally 
shows emotions or control and varies between genders and cultures. In Western 
cultures, particularly in the US, Australia, Canada and the UK, handshaking is 
common (even for strangers). People of Islamic and Hindu backgrounds avoid 
touching with the left hand because to do so is a social insult, as the left hand is 
used for toilet functions. It is the custom in India to break bread only using the 
right hand (a difficult task for non-Indians). Islamic cultures do not approve of 
touching between genders in public (even hand shakes), but consider such touching 
(including hand holding and hugs) between same-sex people to be appropriate. 
Many Asians avoid touching the head because the head houses the soul, and a 
touch puts it in jeopardy. Cultures such as the English, German, Scandinavian, 
Chinese, and Japanese which have high emotional restraint have little public 
contact, whereas those which encourage emotion, such as the Latino, Middle-
Eastern and Jewish, have more frequent touching. 
 
Judgements, based on looks and dress, seem to be a trait of all cultures. 
Europeans and Americans appear to place a high value on dress, grooming and 
personal attractiveness, partly induced by marketing and affluence. Around the 
globe there are differing cultural standards on what is appropriate, attractive in 
dress and what constitutes modesty. Companies have different dress codes which 
are used in the corporate world as a sign of status but dress codes can alter quickly. 
 
It appears that as verbal codes are used within a particular cultural context, 
they evolve over time (Underwood, 2003). This also happens to non-verbal codes. 
Through travelling and working in different countries, an increased awareness of 
how specific gestures are different from one country to another is developed. For 

Communication

example, total confusion in a conversation can result from Indians shaking their 
head in response to matters being discussed. One needs to be very cautious and 
rephrase conversations to adjust to body language in this environment.  
 
People tend to define a space bubble or proximity by their own culture. For 
example, when dealing with some Middle-Eastern and Asian cultures, one finds 
that space limits are vastly different from those in Western cultures. In some 
situations people stand so close that Westerners can feel quite uncomfortable with 
a constant desire to back away. Other cultures find Europeans cold and aloof 
because of this tendency to back off.  
 
 
Checklist: Tips for improved non-verbal communication 
 
âº Make yourself at ease with the person you are communicating with. Avoid 
being too close or too far away. (Within 600-700 mm is a comfortable range for 
city dwellers of Anglo Saxon heritage.) 
âº Be attentive and try to relax, but avoid slouching or sitting rigidly. Show 
interest by leaning slightly toward the other person.  
âº Avoid staring or glaring, but try to maintain frequent eye contact. 
âº Respond with non-verbal communication while the other person is talking by 
simple nods for approval or agreement. 
âº All non-verbal gestures should be natural, smooth and unobtrusive. Do not 
allow gestures to dominate your words. Be aware of gestures that reveal 
negative emotions and frustration. 
âº Slow down your rate of speech to a little slower than normal, to avoid 
indicating impatience. Use the tone of your voice to give a feeling of warmth and 
acceptance. 
âº Do not mumble but maintain a clearly audible voice, not too loud nor too soft. 
âº Avoid using your limbs, hands and feet as barriers. 
âº Appropriate genuine smiling assists in gaining rapport. 
âº Closing eyes and yawning can block communication, so attempt to be alert 
when interacting with others.

7.5 ORAL PRESENTATIONS 
Woodrow Wilson, the 28th president of the United States said, âIf I am to speak ten 
minutes, I need a week for preparation; if fifteen minutes, three days; if half an 
hour, two days; if an hour, I am ready nowâ. This clearly indicates that good 
presentations do not just happen, and if someone makes it look easy then it is likely 
that much more effort and practice has gone into the talk than appearances would 
indicate.  
 
Oral communication skills are required by all engineers, as a consultant to 
present a companyâs case to win work, to present results to senior management and 
clients, or to present details of projects to the community. Technical presentations 
can involve both oral and written communication. In all communications, an 
awareness of the audience is essential to ensure a consistent style, flow and clarity 
of detail. There is no easy way to ensure a presentation goes well. However, there 

192 
Engineering Planning and Design 
 
are some key points that should be addressed well before the time of the 
presentation.  
 
 
Checklist: Oral presentations 
 
Preliminaries 
âº What is the objective of the talk?  
âº What do you want your audience to think or do as a result of this talk? 
âº Analyse the audience: what do you know about them, their backgrounds, 
ages, needs, motivation? 
âº Consider issues like the time of day, number in audience, and size of room. 
 
Opening 
âº How will you hook the audience? 
âº What will your first words be?  
âº Ensure that you thank the chairperson and address the audience!. 
âº What is the purpose of the talk? 
âº What benefit will the talk be to the audience? 
 
Signposts/Material Content 
âº Can you create a mind map showing the content of the talk? 
âº Point the way through your talk â use headings.  
âº Research your talk thoroughly. Preparation is the key to a good talk.  
 
Notes 
âº Short memory aids only.  
âº Key words or ideographs or even a mind map on a small card. 
âº DO NOT READ 
 
Visual aids 
âº Ensure visual aids are clear, easy and appropriate for ideas being expressed. 
âº Present them effectively - do not have colours that make the text unintelligible.  
âº Use a sans serif font (e.g. Arial) and a minimum font size of 18 pt. 
âº Have a maximum of 30 to 35 words per slide : fewer is better. 
âº Describing a picture or graph is better than a slide full of words. 
âº Reinforce, explain and illustrate your ideas. 
âº Aim for approximately one minute per slide (as a rough guide) 
 
Delivery 
âº Transmit energy and enthusiasm â use positive gestures and eye contact. 
âº Ensure voice is clear and well modulated. 
âº Body behaviours have to be congruent â generally be yourself. 
 
Closing 
âº What are the main points to be reinforced in the summary? 
âº What is the final impression I wish to make? 
âº What will be my final words? 
âº Summarise and finish with a well-prepared strong closing. 
âº Remember, it is the chairpersonâs responsibility to handle question time. 
 
 
 

Communication 
193 
 
 
A common failing with presentations is running short or running out of time. 
Speakers should consider their timing carefully and practise their talk to ensure 
that it will run to time. It is at the end of the talk where it is likely that the key 
points are to be made and where, if the ending is rushed, much impact will be lost.  
 
Rather than just attempting to say everything more quickly, it is better to 
leave out a whole section so that time can be spent on giving a good summary of 
the rest of the work and leaving the audience with a positive feeling about the 
presentation. If there are people in the audience who are particularly interested in 
the details of the work, they can always seek the speaker out after the talk.  
7.6 WRITTEN COMMUNICATION 
Written communication, including reports, emails, letters, memoranda, sketches 
and drawings, is perhaps the form of communication where the most effort is 
expended. In talking and presenting material orally, instant feedback is generally 
received. An audience that is slowly drifting off to sleep is letting you know your 
presentation is not going well and that something needs to be done. A written 
report receives no such instant feedback, but can generate the same consequences, 
and there is no chance to make immediate amendments. During the normal course 
of events, engineers will be required to write resumÃ©s, business letters, memoranda 
and reports for many different reasons. In the following sections, suggestions are 
given to make writing as easy as possible and to ensure that it conforms to some 
basic standards. The idea that writing should follow a standard may seem 
somewhat constraining, but it should be remembered that one of the main reasons 
for communication is to present information clearly and to make the job of the 
reader as easy as possible. If this means a little extra effort for the writer, so be it. 
 
 
Checklist: Writing  
 
âº Avoid jargon.  
âº Have a structure with an introduction, main content and a conclusion or 
recommendations. 
âº Ensure all written material is checked for spelling, grammar and punctuation. 
âº Read the whole piece from top to bottom. 
âº Have colleagues read at least key sections of the report. 
âº Leave sufficient time so that it is not rushed. Rushed sections are likely to be 
at the end and this is where the key results are found and impressions made. 
 
Memoranda  
The purpose of a memorandum is to give information to one or more people at 
once within an organisation. It is, at the same time, a useful and formal way of 
having your views or advice on a particular topic entered onto the official record. 
Although emails have largely replaced the written memorandum in the modern 
engineering office, they may still be used for more formal or more important 
transmissions, and for this reason it is important to be able to write and structure 
one in an appropriate format.  

194

Memos are usually restricted in length and contain important information in a 
clear and easy to find format.

Â§ 
Make the message as short and clear as possible. 
Â§ 
Use bold text to make the most important information clear. 
Â§ 
Make sure that all memoranda are proofread and spell-checked. 
 
The email 
Email is a form of communication used every day in business and for private 
purposes. A few simple rules and a little care can eliminate the drudgery of having 
to respond to numerous emails every day. In many ways the email is similar to the 
memorandum. However, there is one important difference. The email has, by its 
nature, an urgency and an informality about it.  
 
 
Checklist: emails 
 
âº Put enough details in the subject line so that meaning of the email is 
conveyed, such as âRemember Salinity Project meeting Tuesday 25 Julyâ. 
âº To reduce the number of emails received, when appropriate insert âNo Reply 
requiredâ in the âSubjectâ line or the opening line of your e-mail.  
âº Avoid overuse of CAPITAL LETTERS, as this conveys anger and shouting; 
also avoid âexclamation marksâ and bold, which can put too much stress in the 
message!! 
âº Cut and paste standard replies for frequently asked questions or requests.  
âº Although emails tend to be less formal, do a spell-check before sending. 
âº Only reply to the sender if necessary, rather than to all on the senderâs list.  
âº Only have one subject per email. People often respond to your first and last 
questions, but overlook or forget the others, so keep things simple.  
âº When replying to a series of questions, embed your answer after the question 
or other remarks at appropriate places.  
âº Any email you send could be forwarded to others so make sure you are aware 
of that and hence make the receiver aware of the fact if you do not want it to 
be forwarded on by marking it as âConfidentialâ. 
âº Use plain text, simple language, short paragraphs and keep messages under 
25 lines long, if possible, as this is the length that can be read on one screen. 
âº Alert recipients when sending large attachments.  
âº When forwarding a message, put comments at the top rather than at the end. 
âº Always obtain permission from an author before sending on personal emails.  
âº Send information using a text format, if at all possible, rather than HTML.

A former NASA engineer who now runs time management seminars, asked a 
group of time management participants for ideas on improving time used on 
writing and sending emails. The above email checklist was developed from some 
of those responses (Turla, 2005) and combined with those in McShane and 
Travaglione (2003). 
 
Emails can be quick to send and almost demand a quick response. Engineers 
should ensure that their responses are well considered because, as indicated 
previously, the reply is on the public record. 
Business letters 
When reports are written, they will generally be sent with a covering letter. That 
letter then is the first thing that the client will read and therefore is important in 
creating the first impression, similar to the cover of a report. Most companies have 
quite strict standards for letters and it is better to know what they are, rather than 
risk the task of many re-drafts, or worse, upsetting a client or boss. A typical letter 
is shown to bring out some of the key elements that are generally required.

Dear Caroline,  
 
RE: Contract for Sediment Ponds AW2005/89 
 
The body of the letter should be clear, concise and courteous. The way you 
organise the body of your letter will depend on the reason for writing it, but many 
of the other features will be common to all formal business letters.  
 
 
Yours sincerely,

The company letterhead will generally give contact details of the company. 
The date is important both for sequencing of communications and filing, but it also 
can have legal ramifications in situations where the time advice given or received 
is crucial to subsequent actions. In a business letter, the date is located under the 
company letterhead or the address. Formality generally applies to the details of the 
person to whom the letter is written, including his or her title and company details. 
As an aid to understanding, it is helpful to state clearly what the contents of the 
letter are in regard to (RE:). Once again, this is to make the receiverâs task as easy 
as possible. A business letter should be structured so that it has a beginning, a 
middle and an end. In the main body of the letter, the main information is 
presented. A key aim is to ensure that the letter is not misunderstood and for this 
reason it is essential that the language is clear and simple to avoid 
misunderstandings. There are no awards for showing a large vocabulary in a 
business letter. The most important thing is to ensure that you communicate your 
message as effectively as possible.  
 
The final words should tell the person what actions are required or perhaps 
give thanks for any help given. It is customary to sign off with; âYours faithfullyâ 
in a formal business letter and when the name of the person is unknown; and with 
âYours sincerelyâ if the person is known personally. Nowadays it is acceptable to 
use less formal closings such as âKind regardsâ and âBest regardsâ if there is less 
formality in your letter. The closing signature can be located on either side of the 
letter. Most companies have a template for writing business letters in their own 
style and therefore this should be used. 
Report Writing 
Writing reports takes more time and is harder work than most people think. A 
poorly presented report, where the author is unaware or uninterested in the most 
basic rules, will be read with this in mind and will most likely lead to some 
information or recommendations being discounted or totally ignored. The 
engineering report conforms to quite a standard format. The aim is to ensure that 
the readers, no matter what their interest in the work, will be able to get the 
appropriate level of detail that they require: that level of detail is determined by the 
reader, and not the writer. For this reason, it is quite common for the same material 
to appear a number of times in the same report so that it can be found in an 
efficient manner. 
 
The checklist for formal reports shows the structure that should be developed 
for technical reports.  
 
The title page should include the title of the report, the names and affiliations 
of the authors, the date (month and year) of publication and perhaps some 
company identifiers. 
 
The abstract or executive summary should take only a few pages at most and 
should summarise the whole report in a highly condensed form. It should allow 
anyone who just wants to know what the report is about to find what work or 
research was undertaken and what conclusions were reached, without having to 
look at the body of the report at all. It should not read as a teaser to the main report 
and generally does not include references, or extended descriptions.

Word processing software will generate tables of contents, lists of figures and 
lists of tables automatically. The information required is taken from the actual 
report so any changes can be reflected in an updated table of contents easily. 
 
 
Checklist: A formal report 
 
âº Title Page includes title, authors and date 
 
 
âº Executive Summary includes: 
 
reason for study; 
 
summary of what work was carried out; and 
 
summary of key findings and/or recommendations of study. 
 
âº Table of contents (may be automatically generated) 
 
âº Introduction 
 
starts on page 1; 
 
sets out reason for report / study; and 
 
refers to copy of design brief (if available) in Appendix. 
 
 
âº Other Chapters 
 
develop an argument that leads logically to the conclusion; 
 
lead to a solution or outcome; 
 
have sections and sub-sections that are numbered consistently; and 
 
ensure all âfactsâ from literature are referenced. 
 
âº Illustrations and Tables 
 
ensure all have labels and captions in the proper place (below or above); 
 
captions allow the figure or table to be understood independently of text; 
 
all appear after first reference in text; and 
 
ensure all figures are referenced in text. 
 
âº References 
 
listed in alphabetical order in reference section; and 
 
listed in a standard format (e.g., Harvard system, Snooks & Co., 2002). 
 
âº Appendices should only contain information that distracts from the flow of the 
argument in the main report and the reader of the report is not likely to want to 
see. 
 
âº Miscellaneous 
 
Spell-check entire document; 
 
write in the third person, i.e., âThis was carried outâ rather than âwe did thisâ; 
 
search for and eliminate 1st person text (I, me, my, we, us, our); 
 
read the whole report before submission; 
 
one-sentence paragraphs should be avoided; 
 
 
single-paragraph sections or subsections should be avoided; 
 
avoid vague terms such as âvery largeâ, âreally expensiveâ; and 
 
avoid use of capital letters in middle of sentences unless for proper names.

Most reports start with a chapter entitled âIntroductionâ. It contains a brief 
description of the need for the report, gives general background information and 
may even give a brief summary of the contents. A report should be written in the 
form of an argument that takes the reader from the problem to a solution and a 
clear introduction is necessary to show how this argument will be made. 
 
The body of the report may contain a number of different chapters that set out 
in logical order (rather than the order in which the work may have been carried 
out) the argument the author or authors are making. 
 
The final chapters of a report tend to be a summary and set of conclusions 
and recommendations. In this chapter or chapters, the authors summarise and 
integrate any conclusions that have been made in report. Recommendations may be 
to do with how information should be used or what further work needs to be 
carried out. Following the report, there will generally be a need to list the sources 
of information which were referred to in the report. There are a number of standard 
ways of presenting this information. Most will contain, as a bare minimum, the 
author(s), the date of publication, the title of the work, the journal or report or book 
or conference proceedings that it appeared in and/or the publisher. Also given are 
page numbers if the work was in a journal, or the total number of pages if the work 
is a book. The general rules also apply to web references. Here one additional 
piece of information is generally required: the download date. This is because web 
references change quickly and it is useful to know when the information was 
sourced. 
 
The last element of a report may be a single appendix or a series of 
appendices. Information and results which are useful background material but are 
not needed for understanding the main arguments in the report should be included 
in an appendix. Bulky test results or mathematical derivations can also be included, 
but note that not all test results need to be included. Generally within an 
engineering report there will be many figures and drawings to enhance the 
communication and to enable the reader to fully grasp the subject material. In 
design, the main form of communication is through engineering drawings. 
Drawings  
Much engineering communication is completed through drawings. The ideas 
evolve in sketches and doing calculations to formalise a design. The design of a 
system, whether it is an engine, a building, a water treatment plant or a space 
shuttle will be communicated through the various phases of a project from 
preliminary investigation to the construction phase of a project, as described in 
Chapter 3, by a very large number of drawings. With computer-aided drafting 
techniques, many different forms of drawings have evolved, including 3D details, 
animations and traditional plan and cross-sectional views. An important part of any 
drawing is the Title box because this has boxes for various signatories such as 
project manager, designer, drawer and checker. Signing off on these indicates the 
people responsible for the design.  
 

Communication 
199 
 
7.7 COMMUNICATION IN GROUPS  
The success or failure of large engineering projects inevitably depends on 
communication within and between groups. Engineers must therefore know the 
basics of communicating within groups and facilitating groups and group meetings.  
 
Communication is an integral part of developing synergy in a group to 
develop trust and cooperation. Covey (1989) describes the synergy that comes 
from good communication as an understanding that the whole is greater than the 
sum of the parts. It comes from respecting differences between individuals and 
relies on building on strengths to compensate for weaknesses. Most importantly, it 
requires both trust and cooperation, as illustrated in Figure 7.3. Note that if there is 
high trust and high cooperation, then a win/win situation can result. 
 
Many of the activities for good group performance were outlined in Chapter 
6 with the leader of a group having to be aware of the backgrounds and styles of 
the members of the group and the need to ensure participation from all. Simple 
processes for conducting meetings were also outlined to ensure effective meetings.  
 
 
Figure 7.3 Levels of communication (adapted from Covey, 1989). 
7.8 PLAGIARISM 
Plagiarism is the unacknowledged use of the material written by others with or 
without the intention of passing it off as your own work. With the development of 
electronic information systems, plagiarism is on the increase, as it is becoming 
much easier to source material from a range of different areas. 
 
Plagiarism is wrong and dangerous for a number of reasons. If you have read 
something, it is actually in your interest to cite the source and to quote directly if it 
is something that is going to help your argument. That is what is referred to as 
scholarship. Plagiarised material is often quite easy to detect, either by simply 
reading the material and reflecting on the changes in language, or by using one of 
the many electronic plagiarism detectors that are available nowadays that can 
check submissions against a vast range of publicly available material from around

the world. It is essential, therefore, to reference all the sources of information 
which are used in any report or design. When using material, ensure that the source 
is credited somewhere in the material, e.g., according to âSmithers and Smith 
(1999).â When exact phrases from the original source are used, be sure to use 
quotation marks to identify any exact text. Paraphrasing can also be deemed to be 
plagiarism when the same ideas are used, without acknowledgement as in the 
original source, so make sure all ideas are referenced. 
 
 
Contrasting Styles of Communication 
 
Bennis (1997), the author of 26 books on leadership, has a favourite example of 
two contrasting styles of communication, those of the British Prime Ministers 
Gladstone and Disraeli.  
 
It was said of Gladstone, a 19th century Liberal Prime Minister, that if you had 
dinner with him, you came away believing that he was the worldâs brightest, 
wittiest, most charming man. However, if you had dinner with Disraeli, a peer 
who became a Conservative Prime Minister, you came away believing that you 
were the brightest, wittiest, most charming person in the country.  
 
7.9 SUMMARY 
All engineers require good communication skills, whether in managerial positions 
or technical specialist areas. Communication involves more than simply sending a 
message; it necessitates that the correct message is received by using feedback and 
active listening. Managing personnel in project teams also requires an 
understanding of how the individuals within the team can facilitate or block 
communication between members. In all communications, an awareness of who is 
receiving the message is essential to ensure a consistent style, flow and clarity of 
detail. There is no easy way to ensure an oral presentation or a written report is 
well received other than by putting a lot of effort into the structure and flow of the 
material, ensuring that it is relevant to the topic being discussed, and looking for 
feedback. 
 
In larger organisations the manager of groups must be aware that there are 
some people who listen and others who do not. A strategy that assumes everyone 
understands what has been said can lead to disaster, therefore miscommunication 
can be avoided by asking listeners and readers if clarification of details is required. 
A good rule is to attempt to keep communication channels open and be receptive to 
communication at all levels. It is imperative that other peopleâs body language is 
observed when involved in discussions and when there are conflicts. It is important 
that as a manager and leader of engineering teams you have consistent 
communications, body language and actions, thus imparting a feeling of trust 
amongst the team. This example to fellow team members will then be the catalyst 
to open communication within the group and across the boundaries of other groups 
within the organisation.  

Communication 
201 
 
 
Use simple language to convey your message in all reports, memoranda and 
letters. Remember to read and check the spelling and grammar of all outgoing 
correspondence. Always reference all sources of ideas and information. 
PROBLEMS 
7.1 What processes are important in giving a good presentation? What checks of 
the room where you are going to present would you make? 
 
7.2 Give guidelines for reading body language by the following visual clues:  
 
(a) facial expression;  
 
(b) posture;  
 
(c) gestures;  
 
(d) clothing, grooming and environment.  
7.3 Give guidelines for reading body language by the following auditory clues:  
 
(a) specific words that are spoken;  
 
(b) sound of the voice;  
 
(c) rapidity of speech, frequency and length of pauses. 
7.4 Everyone will benefit from improving listening skills. Search the Internet to 
find information on becoming a better listener. Select one or two areas that you 
want to improve on and try those over the next 48 hours. Write a one-paragraph 
report on why you think you have improved or not. 
7.5 Write an essay of no more than 1000 words explaining the importance of good 
communication skills for engineers. Use a mind map to prepare the outline of the 
essay and which can also be used for an oral presentation. 
7.6 Draft a letter to seek employment from a company that you have seen is doing 
interesting work in an area of engineering that interests you.

CHAPTER EIGHT  
Economic Evaluation 
 
This chapter deals with the economic evaluation of engineering projects. The 
purpose of economic evaluation is to identify the benefits and costs of a project and 
hence to determine whether it is justified on economic grounds. Alternative 
solutions to an engineering problem can also be compared based on their respective 
costs and benefits. It is usually necessary to discount the future benefits and costs of 
a project in order to make comparisons in terms of present value. Various economic 
criteria have been proposed for the comparison of projects. Each of these has its 
merits, although the best on theoretical grounds is net present value.  
8.1 INTRODUCTION 
An engineering project involves the transformation of limited resources into 
valuable final products or outputs. For example, the construction of a dam involves 
the use of resources such as concrete, steel, human effort, and machine time. The 
dam is used to produce outputs such as water for domestic and industrial purposes, 
flood control, and recreation. 
 
The engineer must be concerned not only with the technical feasibility of the 
project (i.e. will it work?) but also the economic feasibility. Economic evaluation is 
aimed at assessing whether the value of the final products exceeds the value of the 
resources used by the project. The values of the outputs when measured in 
economic terms are called the benefits of the project. Similarly the values of the 
resources used in its construction and maintenance when measured in economic 
terms are called the costs of the project. 
 
In the private sector, benefits and costs are measured by cash flows into and 
out of the firm, respectively. That is, a conceptual boundary is drawn around the 
firm and benefits and costs are represented by cash flows across this boundary. 
 
For public sector projects, benefits and costs must be considered for society as 
a whole. In this case, benefits and costs are not necessarily associated with cash 
flows. For example, the benefits of a public transport system are not necessarily 
measured by the revenue which it generates. The government may choose to run the 
system at a loss for social or environmental reasons. In this case the benefits to the 
users of the system would probably exceed the revenue generated by it. If, for 
example, public transport were offered free of charge, few people would argue that 
the benefits to society were zero. 
 
Sometimes there is a different perception of benefits and costs at various 
levels of government. For example, the federal government may provide a subsidy 
of 50% of the capital costs of new sewage treatment plants. When a state 

204 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
 
government is evaluating a particular plant it would consider this subsidy as a 
reduction in the cost of the project. On the other hand, the federal government 
would consider the subsidy as merely a transfer payment from one branch of 
government to another and therefore not a true benefit or cost to society as a whole. 
In fact, the federal government may require the state to provide economic 
justification for the project in its (i.e. the federal governmentâs) terms without 
including the subsidy effect. 
8.2 THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY 
The costs and benefits (or revenue) of an engineering project usually occur over a 
long time period. For example, consider the construction of a new freeway. A 
typical time stream of benefits and costs is illustrated in Figure 8.1. Costs will be 
high during the construction phase which may last for three or four years. These 
costs could include disruption and inconvenience to users of the existing and 
adjoining roads. Annual maintenance and repair costs will be low initially, but will 
increase due to ageing of the pavement, bridges, and other components. The benefits 
to road users will be primarily due to savings in vehicle operating costs, savings in 
travel time and a reduction in the number of accidents in relation to the pre-existing 
road network. These benefits would normally increase with time due to increasing 
volumes of traffic using the freeway.

Figure 8.1 The time stream of benefits and costs for a freeway. 
 
 
In carrying out an economic evaluation of such a project, it must be 
recognized that benefits or costs incurred in ten years cannot be directly compared 
with those incurred in the current year. Given the choice between $1000 now and 
$1000 in 10 years, very few people would choose the latter. In the first place, the 
effects of inflation are such that fewer goods and services could be purchased with 
the future sum than at present. However, even in the absence of inflation, human 
nature is such that there is a preference to consume goods now rather than later, and 
to postpone costs if possible. This is clearly evidenced by the fact that many 

Economic Evaluation 
205 
 
individuals are willing to borrow money at an interest rate which exceeds the rate of 
inflation. Therefore, in carrying out economic evaluation, it is necessary to discount 
future benefits and costs in order to make them directly comparable with benefits 
and costs incurred now. This is carried out using discounting formulae derived from 
considerations of compound interest. 
8.3 DISCOUNTING FORMULAE 
In all the economic calculations that follow, there are two basic assumptions: 
 
ï· 
there is a single rate of interest (the discount rate) that applies into the 
future for both borrowing and lending; 
ï· 
interest is paid in a compound fashion; that is, if interest is earned, then 
it is added to the capital and taken into account for future calculations 
of interest. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 8.2 Historical values of the standard variable home loan interest rate in Australia.  
(Source: Loansense, 2016) 
 
If one looks at home loan interest rates and how they have varied over time in 
Australia (see Figure 8.2), it may be thought that the first assumption is 
questionable. However, despite the fact that rates do vary, it is usual for calculations 
to be carried out assuming an unvarying rate. If the rate does change at a later time, 
adjustments are made, again on the assumption of a constant rate into the future.

It is convenient to show the process on a timeline (Figure 8.3) where the 
horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis the units of money. While this 
appears trivial for the present example, once the situation becomes more 
complicated, the advantages of the time plot will become apparent.

Compound interest dates back to antiquity 
 
The concept of compound interest (interest paid on interest) dates back to the 
ancient civilisations of Sumer and Babylon where it was usual to charge 20 % p.a. 
compound interest on loans of silver and 33 1/3 % p.a. compound interest on loans 
of barley. 
Around 2400 BCE, the ruler of the Sumerian city of Lagash, Enmetena, 
engaged in a battle against the neighbouring city of Umma. Enmetena had a 
temple built to commemorate his victory and the details of the battle were recorded 
on the clay foundation stone of the temple. Also recorded on the foundation stone 
was the fact that Lagesh had loaned a large quantity of barley to Umma at 33 1/3 % 
interest p.a. The scribe had correctly calculated that the amount of barley to be 
repaid after 7 years was 7.5 times the original loan.  
If the initial quantity borrowed was X, the future quantity owed can be 
calculated using Equation (8.3) as follows: 
 
 
F = P (1+i)n = X (1 + 0.33333)7 = 7.492 X

Present worth - uniform series 
It is often necessary to find the present worth of a uniform series of annual 
payments. These may be regular mortgage repayments for a homeowner or the cost 
of leasing a particular piece of equipment for a manufacturer. The timeline for this 
is shown in Figure 8.5 where $A is paid at the end of each year for n years, and 
these payments are to be made equivalent to a single sum $P at the present time. 
Note that it is usual to assume that annual costs for maintenance or repair occur at 
the end of each year, whereas capital costs for new buildings or equipment occur at 
the start of the year.

Loan repayments and outstanding balances 
When a loan is taken out, it is normal to repay the total debt over a number of years 
with repayments that are maintained at the same level over the whole period. This 
raises the problem of knowing how much is left to repay at any particular time. For 
example, in the case of a loan of $100,000 taken out at a 7.5% annual interest rate 
over a 25 year period, how much is still owed at the end of 1 year or 10 years? In 
the following calculations it is assumed that repayments are made annually. A 
similar procedure may be applied to monthly or weekly repayments. The annual 
repayment on the loan can be calculated from Equation (8.7):

To determine the outstanding debt after x years, it is necessary to consider the 
present value of the annual repayments that remain to be paid over a period of (n - 
x) years. Therefore, the outstanding debt after 1 year (P1) is a series of annual 
payments over 24 years. In this case:

Therefore, after a single annual repayment of $8,971.07 there is still 
$98,528.96 left to repay, a debt reduction of only $1,471.04. The other $7,500.34 
has gone in interest repayments. As time goes by, the total repayment remains the 
same, but interest component gradually reduces while that going to reduce the 
outstanding debt gradually increases. This is shown in Figure 8.6 for the current 
example. 
 
 
Figure 8.6 The split between interest (solid) and capital repayment (hatched) of each annual 
payment is shown. Note how the interest component gradually reduces over time. 
 
 
After 10 years, 15 annual payments each of $8,971.07 remain to be paid, so 
the remaining balance of the loan (P10) can be determined as follows:

The balance still owed after one year is $98,583.93 which is slightly higher 
than for annual repayments. 
 
The subject of different repayment intervals will be dealt more formally in the 
next section where it will be seen that it is possible to determine a relationship 
between the same interest rate compounded annually and monthly. 
Effective interest rate 
Interest rates are generally quoted as a percentage per annum (i.e per year), but the 
compounding period (the frequency with which the interest is charged or paid) is 
often less than a year. As we have just seen, this makes a difference to the 
calculations, and in order to allow a valid comparison the concepts of a nominal 
interest rate and an effective interest rate have been developed. If the nominal 
interest rate is r percent per annum and it is charged in m periods over a year then 
the interest rate applied at each period is (r/m). For example, an annual rate of 18% 
charged monthly means that the interest charged each month is 1.5%. Therefore if 
$P is invested at the start of the year the balance at the end of m periods can be 
calculated using Equation 8.3 as:

Hence, 18% per year charged monthly is equivalent to 19.56% per year 
charged annually. Note that in a number of countries, financial institutions must 
publish their interest rates as an equivalent annual rate so that consumers can make 
informed choices. 
 
 
Interest and the natural logarithm 
 
If the annual interest rate is 100% and $1 is invested for 1 year, then the way 
interest is charged (annually, monthly, etc.) can be seen to change the outcome 
considerably. If charged annually, the amount invested at the end of the year will be 
$2. If it is paid six monthly, the amount will be $2.25. These, and other possibilities, 
climaxing in continuous payment of interest are

The effect of inflation on economic evaluation 
Inflation is represented by a rising general level of prices. It is important to note that 
during an inflationary period the prices of all goods and services are not necessarily 
rising nor are all prices necessarily rising at the same rate. The effect of inflation is 
that a dollar next year will buy less than a dollar today. There have also been 
periods in history when the general level of prices in some countries or regions 
decreased. This is called deflation. 
 
Changes in the general level of prices may be measured by a price index. This 
is defined as 'the average price of a mixture of goods and services in a given year' 
divided by 'the average price of the same mixture of goods and services in a base 
year' (expressed as a percentage). A common price index is the consumer price 
index or CPI. The CPI measures changes in the prices of goods and services 
purchased by moderate-income families. It is based on the prices of a large number 
of representative items each weighted according to its relative importance in the 
typical family budget. Movements in the consumer price indexes for a number of 
countries are shown in Table 8.2. 
 
Of particular relevance to engineering projects are the price indexes for 
construction and building costs. These indexes for a number of North American 
cities are available from the Engineering News Record website (Engineering News 
Record, 2017). In Australia, current and historical values of the building cost index 
can be obtained from Rawlinsons (2016). 
 
It is important to distinguish clearly between the concepts of inflation and the 
time value of money. Even in the absence of inflation, very few people would be 

Economic Evaluation 
213 
 
prepared to lend money at zero interest. As most people would prefer to consume 
goods and services now rather than later, there is clearly a real time value of money. 
In times of inflation, lenders expect a real rate of return on their money which 
exceeds the inflation rate. For example, anyone who receives 3 percent p.a. interest 
on an investment when the inflation rate is 5 percent p.a. is clearly losing money.

Before we consider how inflation is taken into account in economic 
evaluation, some definitions are required.  
 
Actual dollars (or then-current dollars) are dollars which are current in the 
particular years that the benefits and costs occur. For example, if a person bought a 
block of land in 1970 for $50,000 (in then-current dollars) and sold it in 2000 for 
$200,000 (in then-current dollars) have they made a profit on the investment? The 
answer is yes if $200,000 in 2000 will buy more goods and services than $50,000 in 
1970. Otherwise, they have lost on the investment.  
 
Constant-worth dollars are dollars which have the same purchasing power at a 
defined point in time, e.g., 2010 dollars. For example, a new power station is 
designed to provide 8000 GWh of electrical energy per year under certain operating 
conditions. The benefits to consumers of this energy are estimated to be $600m in 
2010 (the first year of operation). Thereafter, the station will continue to provide 
8000 GWh of energy per year for its estimated operating life of 40 years. The 
annual benefits expressed in actual dollars will continue to increase throughout the 
life of the station due to inflationary increases in the price of electricity and the 
prices of goods produced with it. However, when expressed in constant-worth 
dollars (e.g., 2010 dollars) the annual benefits are likely to be constant over the life 
of the station if the same amount of energy is produced each year.  
 
The nominal interest rate is the rate received on invested money (or paid on 
borrowed money) when calculated in terms of actual (or inflated) dollars. The real 

214 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
 
rate of interest on an investment is the rate received net of inflation. For example, if 
money is invested at a nominal interest rate of 8% p.a. when the annual inflation 
rate is 5% p.a., the real interest rate (i.e., above inflation) is approximately 3% p.a.  
 
The economic evaluation of engineering projects can be taken into account in 
one of two equivalent ways:  
 
ï· 
by using actual dollars and the nominal interest rate throughout; 
ï· 
by using constant-worth dollars and the real rate of interest throughout. 
 
 
The first method is commonly used in evaluating private sector investments in 
which the future cash flows are estimated in actual dollars and the nominal interest 
rate is usually known. The second method is more commonly used for evaluating 
public sector investments, as it is often easier to estimate future benefits and costs in 
constant-worth dollars. In this case there is no need to estimate an inflation rate. The 
interest rate or discount rate used is the real rate above inflation. As will be 
discussed in Section 8.10, the choice of the discount rate in the public sector is the 
source of some controversy. In this book, constant-worth dollars and real interest or 
discount rates will be used unless otherwise stated.  
Relationship between nominal and real interest rates  
Consider the annual maintenance costs of a bridge which requires a constant 
number of person-hours of maintenance each year during its life of n years. (This is 
a gross simplification, as it would be normal for the amount of maintenance to 
increase as the bridge deteriorates with age.) When expressed in constant-worth 
dollars, the annual maintenance cost of the bridge is a constant amount (say $A) per 
year for the life of the bridge, as shown in Figure 8.7.

If the anticipated inflation rate for the life of the project is f % p.a. 
(compound), then the maintenance costs in actual dollars are shown in Figure 8.8. 
The nominal rate of interest is assumed to be known and is denoted by in. The 
objective is to find a relationship between the real interest rate, i, the nominal 
interest rate, in, and the inflation rate, f. The present worth of the series shown in

8.4 EVALUATION CRITERIA 
Various economic criteria have been proposed for use in comparing engineering 
projects. The following criteria are described briefly and compared: 
 
ï· 
payback period; 
ï· 
net present value; 
ï· 
equivalent annual worth; 
ï· 
benefit-cost ratio; and 
ï· 
internal rate of return. 
 
Payback Period 
The payback period is defined as the time it takes for the project to generate 
sufficient net benefits to cover its initial cost of construction and implementation. 
For example, if a project has an initial capital cost of $10m, annual benefits of $3m 
and annual operating costs of $1m, the payback period can be calculated as: 
 
 
Net annual benefits = $3 m - $1 m = $2 m 
 
Payback period = $10 m / $2 m = 5 years 
Net Present Value 
The net present value (NPV) of a project is defined as the present value of all 
benefits minus the present value of all costs. It can be written as: 
 
 
PVC
PVB
NPV
ï­
ï½
  
 
 
 
 
(8.16) 
where PVB is the Present Value of Benefits and PVC is the Present Value of Costs. 
By using the formulae for PVB and PVC we can write:

where Bt is the benefit in year t, Ct is the cost in year t, i is the discount (or interest) 
rate and n is the life of the project (years). The calculation of NPV therefore 
involves discounting all costs and benefits back to the present time to allow them to 
be compared at the same point in time. It is important to note that while Equation 
(8.17) is mathematically correct, it is unlikely that it would be the way the actual 
calculation will be carried out. For example, if the costs are a series of annual 
payments, Equation (8.6) would most likely be used to discount them back to the 
present time.  
 
 
Payback period case studies 
 
Best (2000) quotes a payback period of 4 years for the lighting and heating of a 
building for Lockheed in the 1980s where natural light was used in place of electric 
lights, and where this also reduced the need for air conditioning. It was further 
stated that productivity gains due to the healthier environment in the building gave 
the company a competitive advantage in its bid for a large contract, the profit from 
which would have paid for the entire building. 
Morgan and Elliot (2002) used payback period to justify the implementation 
of a mechanical mixing system for a water supply reservoir. The motors used only 
8.5% of the power required for a traditional aerator plant and had an estimated 
payback period of 4 years based on direct savings in energy costs. 
The price of solar cells has been reported (The Australian - 8/8/01) as falling 
to 20% of that of 25 years ago. Rooftop systems that can meet half a homeâs 
electricity needs for more than 20 years now cost as little as US$10,000. This was 
quoted as having a five- to six-year payback period in California compared with 20 
years a few years ago. 
 
Equivalent annual worth 
The NPV brings all benefits and costs to the present time and gives the answer as a 
single present day sum of money. There may be an argument for representing the 
project in terms of its net annual earnings over the period of the project. In this case 
the Equivalent Annual Worth (EAW) may be more appropriate. The EAW is found 
by converting all project benefits into a series of constant annual benefits for n 
years, where n is the life of the project. Similarly all project costs are converted into 
a series of constant annual costs for n years. The equivalent annual worth is then 
equal to the equivalent annual benefit minus the equivalent annual cost. A reliable 
method for calculating EAW is to determine it from the NPV applying Equation 
(8.7) which gives:

Benefit-cost ratio 
The benefit-cost ratio (B/C) is widely used for evaluating projects in the public 
sector. As normally defined, it is the present value of all benefits divided by the 
present value of all costs:

where the terms are as defined previously.  
 
Again, it is worth noting that while Equation (8.20) is mathematically correct, 
it is unlikely that it would be the way the actual calculation would be carried out. It 
is much more likely that the benefits and costs would be discounted back to present 
worth using appropriate formulae for lump sums or uniform annual series. 
 
 
Benefits and costs of natural and nature-based coastal defences 
 
Narayan et al. (2016) studied the coastal protection benefits and costs of 52 
projects that involved restoration of natural systems including coral reefs, oyster 
reefs, salt marshes and mangroves. The benefits were based on the reduction of 
wave heights and included savings in erosion damage costs, savings in damage 
costs from storms and savings in costs of adjacent coastal structures. They found 
that 41% of the mangrove projects and 6% of the salt marsh projects had a benefit-
cost ratio greater than one. 
Furthermore, Narayan et al. (2016) compared the cost of these restoration 
projects with the cost of constructing submerged reefs at the corresponding 
locations. The dimensions of the reefs were chosen to give the same reduction in 
wave heights. They estimated that the ratio of the cost of a submerged reef to the 
cost of nature-based defences averaged 5 for the mangrove projects and 2 for the 
salt marshes. 
 
 
 

Economic Evaluation 
219 
 
Internal rate of return 
The economic criteria discussed so far (with the exception of the payback period) 
involve the use of a discount rate to convert all future benefits and costs to present 
value. The internal rate of return (also called âyieldâ) is a different concept in that it 
is the implied interest rate of the investment. The internal rate of return is the 
discount rate at which the present value of benefits just equals the present value of 
costs over the life of the project. The internal rate of return (IRR) of a project, r, can 
be determined by finding the discount rate at which the present value of the benefits 
equals the present value of the costs:

Internal rate of return case studies 
 
Campus Review (2002) reported results from an OECD evaluation of the benefits of 
a university education. It was found that the private rate of return to the individual 
was about 11% p.a. and the return to society ranged between 6% and 15% p.a. 
This was based on higher average earnings and lower risks of unemployment. It 
was suggested that the rates were higher than conventional investments and 
therefore money spent on a university education was money well spent. 
 
8.5 A COMPARISON OF THE EVALUATION CRITERIA 
There are three basic types of decisions requiring economic evaluation. They are: 
 
1. go or no-go decisions, for example, whether or not to build a new airport; 
2. the choice of a single project from a list of mutually exclusive projects, for 
example, the choice between a bridge and a tunnel for crossing a major 
waterway; and 
3. the choice of a number of projects when the total funds available are 
limited, for example, how to allocate an annual capital works budget 
between feasible projects. 
 

220 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
 
Go or no-go decisions (type 1 decisions) 
In deciding whether or not an individual project is justified on economic grounds, 
any one of the following criteria may be applied: 
 
 
NPV > 0 
   or    
EAW > 0      or      B/C > 1     or      IRR > i 
 
Only one of these needs to be looked at since they will all lead to the same decision. 
For example, if the present value of benefits exceeds the present value of costs, then 
NPV will be positive, EAW will be positive, B/C will exceed 1 and the IRR will 
exceed the discount rate. 
Choice from a list of mutually exclusive options (type 2 decisions) 
Often economic decisions are used to choose from a number of different options 
where only one will be chosen. For example, what sort of car to buy, or which 
laptop computer to purchase. In each case, one will be chosen in preference to the 
others. For example, consider two air-conditioning systems that are identical in 
performance but differ in their costs. A summary of relevant information is given in 
Table 8.3. For this example, an equivalent annual benefit has been added to make 
the comparison more interesting. A discount rate of 12% p.a. will be used in the 
comparison. The question is: which is the better system on economic grounds?

As the two systems have different lives, it is important to undertake the 
economic evaluation over an appropriate time period. If 10 years is used, System X 
will be due for salvage at the end of the period, whereas System Y will have 5 years 
life remaining. If, on the other hand a period of 15 years is used, System Y will be 
due for salvage at the end of the period, whereas System X will need to be replaced 
after 10 years and the replacement system will have 5 years left at the end of the 
period of analysis, The basic principle is to use a period of analysis that is the lowest 
common multiple of the lives of the various alternatives. In this case this is 30 years, 
as this allows for the initial purchase plus exactly two replacements of System X 
and the initial purchase plus exactly one replacement of System Y. The exception to 
this would be if the company plans to close operations after a certain period (e.g., a 

Economic Evaluation

mine because it is expected to run out of ore). In this case the period of operations 
should be used for the comparison. 
 
Having chosen 30 years as the period of analysis, a timeline is drawn for the 
whole 30-year period for System X (see Figure 8.9). Note that since the plant only 
lasts 10 years, it will have to be replaced twice. If System X is the better choice 
initially, it will also be the preferred choice after 10 years and 20 years. In the 
absence of better information, it is assumed that the original prices are the best 
estimate for the values to be used in subsequent purchases.

support the use of the NPV criterion for this type of decision. Hence System Y 
should be selected despite having an inferior Internal Rate of Return. 
 
A variation on the above decision-making situation is when one design must 
be chosen from among a number of alternatives, each of which performs 
substantially the same function. For example, the choice between two designs for a 
road bridge, one of which has prestressed concrete girders and the other steel 
girders. In both cases, the girders act compositely with a reinforced concrete deck. 
The benefits of the bridge may be assumed to be the same for both designs and may 
therefore be ignored in the decision. In this case the NPV criterion is equivalent to 
finding the design which minimises the present value of costs (assuming that the 
present value of benefits exceeds the present value of costs for the chosen design). 
Alternatively, the choice may be made by minimising the equivalent annual cost. 
The B/C and IRR criteria cannot be used in this situation.

Capital budgeting problems (type 3 decisions) 
It will be the case for most organisations that the cost of the full list of desirable 
projects exceeds the available funds and a choice has to be made regarding which 
projects will proceed in the current budget round and which will not. In the previous 
section, it was found that the different methods of economic comparison (B/C ratio, 
NPV and IRR) can give different results when used to choose one project from 
among a list of options. This problem will also occur in capital budgeting.  
Capital budgeting using B/C or IRR 
When making a capital budgeting decision based on the use of the benefit cost ratio 
or the internal rate of return, the general procedure is to rank the projects from best 
to worst in terms of the criterion. Projects are then chosen from the top down until 
the budget is exhausted. The method is demonstrated with an example. 
Worked example 
A city council is attempting to plan its capital works for the coming year and must 
decide which projects should be selected using B/C ratio. The available budget is 
$35 m.  A list of possible projects is given in Table 8.5. It is assumed that all of the 
costs are capital costs for this example.

Solution Using B/C, the projects are ranked in order as shown in Table 8.6 and 
selected off the top until the budget is exhausted. Selecting from the top gives 
Project E with a cost of $10 m. This leaves $25 m to spend. Therefore, Project A 
can also be selected as it has the next highest B/C ratio and a cost of $15 m. This 
leaves $10 m in the budget. Project D is next on the list in terms of B/C, but its cost 
of $20 m exceeds the $10 m that remains in the budget, so the search continues. 
Project B is next and costs $10 m which exactly exhausts the budget. Therefore, the 
projects selected are E, A and B with a total PVC of $35 m and a NPV of $51 m.

Capital budgeting using NPV 
When using NPV, the procedure is a little more complicated in that a set of projects 
must be chosen which maximise NPV, subject to the available capital budget. 
Therefore, it is necessary to set up an optimisation model which is, in fact, an 
integer linear programming problem. This will be demonstrated using the same 
example above. 
 
To set up the problem in a standard format, the first step is to define variables 
Xi where i = A, B, C, D, E, F such that if Xi = 1 the project is selected, and Xi = 0 if 
not. The aim is to maximise the NPV so a value Z is defined which will be the total 
NPV over all the projects: 
 
 
Maximise Z = 25XA + 8XB + 6XC + 30XD + 18XE + 6XF 
 
 
The cost of all projects selected must not exceed the available budget so the 
following constraint applies:  
 
 
 
15XA + 10XB + 12XC + 20XD + 10XE + 20XF  ï£ 35 
 
 
and Xi = 1 or 0 (binary variables) for i = A, B, C, D, E, F. 
 
 
The solution of integer linear programming problems is beyond the scope of 
this book. The solution of linear programming problems with continuous variables 
is discussed in Chapter 13. For simple problems, the solution can be found by 
inspection or a limited trial and error procedure as: 
 
 
 
XD = XA = 1 with all other Xi = 0. 
 
 
That is, Projects A and D should be undertaken, but not the others. In this case 
the adopted projects have a PVC of $35m and NPV of $55m. This NPV is $4m 
higher than for the projects chosen using B/C. In general it can be shown that NPV 
is a better criterion than B/C for capital budgeting projects. It can also be shown that 
IRR is inferior to NPV in capital budgeting.

World Bank programs and projects 
 
According to Talvitie (2000), when the World Bank lends money for infrastructure 
programs (e.g., road development) in the form of individual projects in developing 
countries, it does so with the aim of reducing poverty, but is also mindful of 
ensuring that projects are well engineered and technically feasible. For major road 
projects, steps are taken to safeguard the environment, cultural heritage, 
indigenous people, and endangered species, and in fact approximately 50% of 
project preparation costs are spent on these issues while the design and traffic 
engineering component may only be 20â25%. 
In terms of selecting actual projects, Talvitie states that the project priority 
setting and program development and evaluation steps occur together rather than 
simply picking projects off the top of the list until the funds are exhausted; an 
approach which may lead to a less-than-optimal mix of projects. 
 
8.6 ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS OF EACH CRITERION 
From the previous section it should be clear that each economic criterion may lead 
to a different choice of project(s) when choosing one or more from a list of feasible 
alternatives. It is important therefore to consider the advantages and limitations of 
each criterion in turn. 
Payback period 
Although the payback period is often quoted in the press, there are various problems 
with the method. Firstly, the criterion does not deal with the time value of benefits 
and costs. Secondly, and equally importantly, the method may ignore significant 
benefits or costs that occur after the payback period. On the other hand, the 
advantage of the method is that it is an intuitively appealing concept and can make a 
compelling argument for implementing a project.  
 
Payback period has also been used in other aspects of economic decision 
making. For example, in an assessment of the economic viability of a biogas project 
for Nigeria, Adeoti et al. (2000) promoted the payback period as a measure of 
project riskiness.  
 
However, because of its limitations, payback period is not recommended for 
use in the evaluation of major engineering projects. 
The internal rate of return 
This criterion has the advantage of not requiring a prescribed value of discount rate 
for its determination. As the specification of a discount rate may be the source of 
considerable controversy, particularly in the public sector, this is an advantage in 
project selection. However, this advantage is outweighed by the disadvantages of 
the criterion, namely:

Worked example  
Figure 8.11 shows the time stream of expected revenue and costs for a proposed 
open-cut mining development. There is an initial cost to establish the mine and 
associated works and a high cost at the end of the project due to clean-up and re-
vegetation activities. What is the IRR for the project?

It can be seen that there are two values of i for which the NPV is zero, 
namely 3.8% and 16%. Both of these values may be interpreted as the internal rate 
of return of the project. If the project were being ranked in a capital budgeting 
exercise it could receive a high or low place depending on the value of IRR used. 
Although this is a somewhat unusual case, it does demonstrate one difficulty with 
using the IRR criterion, i.e., it is the solution of a polynomial equation for which 
more than one root may exist. 
Equivalent annual worth 
To determine the EAW of a general time series of benefits and costs, it is necessary 
first to compute the NPV of the series and convert the NPV into a uniform annual 
payment throughout the life of the project. Considering that EAW gives the same 
ranking as NPV for projects with equal lives, a strong case can be made for using 
NPV directly. 
Benefit-cost ratio 
The benefit-cost ratio has been used extensively in a number of countries for 
comparison of projects of various sizes. It has some degree of appeal when used in 
the context of allocating scarce capital funds, i.e., capital budgeting. However, there 
is some ambiguity in its definition for projects with high recurrent costs (e.g., 
operating, maintenance, and repair costs). The basic issue here is whether the 
present value of recurrent costs should be treated as negative benefits and deducted 
from the numerator of the B/C ratio, or treated as costs and added to the 
denominator. A different value of B/C ratio will result in each case. For example, 
consider the economic comparison of two projects with the relevant economic data 
summarized in Table 8.7.

For B/C Ratio No.1 in Table 8.7, the present values of all costs are included in 
the denominator. For B/C Ratio No.2, the present values of recurrent costs are 

228 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
 
subtracted from the present value of benefits in the numerator. The rationale for this 
latter definition is that in many cases it is really the capital costs which are limited; 
the recurrent costs may be met from the annual benefits. 
 
If the projects are compared using the first definition of B/C ratio, Project 1 is 
preferable. Conversely, if the second definition of B/C ratio is used, Project 2 is 
preferable. On the other hand, NPV always gives an unambiguous ranking of 
projects, as it does not matter whether OMR costs are subtracted from the benefits 
or added to the construction costs. In this case, the NPV criterion favours Project 2. 
 
It might be argued that this is not a major problem; why not just define the 
B/C ratio in one way or the other and proceed? However, in many situations the 
project benefits are composed entirely of savings in cost. For example, the benefits 
of most road projects consist of savings in travel time, savings in operating cost, and 
savings in cost due to a reduction in accidents. In such cases the B/C ratio obtained 
depends on the arbitrary definitions of benefits and costs, whereas NPV is 
unambiguous. 
Net present value 
Most economists advocate NPV as the most appropriate criterion for comparing 
projects. It measures the net gain to society (or the company) of the proposed 
project. It can be used in any of the three decision-making contexts discussed above. 
In the case of a go or no-go decision, the choice is independent of the criterion used. 
However, in choosing a single project from a list of mutually exclusive projects, 
NPV appears to favour large projects.  
Worked example 
An engineering firm is considering the purchase of a multi-core computer since it 
currently pays for the use of a super computer on a time-sharing basis. Two models 
of multi-core computer are being considered. The relevant economic data are given 
in Table 8.8. Which option should be chosen?

Solution The benefits represent the estimated savings in computing cost due to 
reduced usage of the super computer. From Table 8.8 it can be seen that System B 
has the same life as System A, but twice the cost and twice the benefits. Its NPV 
and EAW are therefore twice those of System A, while its B/C ratio and IRR are the 
same. The tendency for NPV (and EAW) to favour large projects is apparent. If 
there is no constraint on the amount of money that can be spent, the increased NPV 
of System B is a net gain to the firm and therefore it is the better option. If there are 
limited funds available for investment due to other equipment needs, the problem 
should be treated as part of a capital budgeting exercise. 
8.7 ECONOMIC BENEFITS 
One important issue which needs to be addressed in economic evaluation is the 
estimation of the benefits and costs of any particular project. In order to understand 
the basis for this estimation some concepts from microeconomic theory can be 
drawn upon. The theory of price determination in perfectly competitive markets is 
presented in Appendix 8A in this chapter. 
 
A fundamental distinction should be drawn between the estimation of benefits 
in the private and public sectors. In the private sector, the benefits (or revenue) of a 
particular project can be identified as cash flows into the firm. Benefits may be 
determined by the additional output of goods and services multiplied by the market 
prices for these commodities. In a competitive market situation, each individual firm 
is obliged to sell its output at the ruling market price due to pressure from its 
competitors. In this situation, the output of any one firm is so small that it has a 
negligible impact on the market price. Furthermore, the market price is a measure of 
the willingness-to-pay of the marginal consumer of that product. Therefore, the 
market price is a measure of the marginal benefit to society of providing additional 
units of the commodity. 
 
In the public sector, the basic economic objective is to maximize benefits 
minus costs for society as a whole. In many cases benefits (and costs) will not equal 
the cash flows which result from the project. For example, public transport could 
be heavily subsidised (or even offered at no charge to some members of the 
community). Few would argue that the price paid for a public transport trip is a true 
measure of the benefit of that trip. 
 
The theoretically correct measure of public sector benefits is the willingness-
to-pay by consumers for the outputs of the project. The amount that a consumer is 
willing to pay for a commodity is a measure of the value of the commodity to that 
consumer. This concept is illustrated in Figure 8.13 for the provision of a new good 
(e.g. a new type of smart phone) to a community. It is assumed that there is a 
maximum price, P1, that any person is willing to pay for the new good. The market 
price, as determined by the intersection of the demand and supply curves for the 
good, is P0. However, as indicated by the demand curve, one consumer is willing to 
pay $P1 for the good. Thus $P1 is a measure of the value of the good to that 
consumer. Someone is willing to pay $P2 (< $P1) for the second unit and so on. 
Finally, someone is only willing to pay $P0 for the good. Anyone not willing to pay 

230 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
 
$P0 will, of course, not purchase the good at the current market price. Therefore, the 
total willingness-to-pay for the good is represented by the total shaded areas (A+ C) 
in Figure 8.13. The amount actually paid by the consumers will equal the revenue 
P0Q0 (area C). The difference between the willingness-to-pay and the revenue is 
called the consumers' surplus (i.e., the area A). It represents the net benefits to the 
consumers of the good. The revenue is a benefit to the producers. 
 
 
Figure 8.13 The willingness-to-pay concept. 
 
 
In many cases the benefits of a public project can be assessed by the increase 
in consumers' surplus resulting from the project. For example, a state highway 
authority proposes to duplicate an existing two-lane highway which is currently 
heavily congested. The benefits of this project can be assessed using the increase in 
consumers' surplus. Figure 8.14 shows the demand-supply situation for the 
highway. The price per trip is represented by the sum of the operating cost plus the 
value of travel time per trip. The supply curve for the existing highway represents 
the price per trip as a function of the two-way volume. 
 
 The equilibrium volume on the existing highway is Q1 vehicles per hour at a 
cost per trip of P1. The new equilibrium volume on the duplicated highway will be 
Q2 at a cost per trip of P2. Note that an increase in volume is expected because an 
additional number of motorists now find it attractive to travel on the highway at the 
reduced price of P2 per trip. 
 
The benefit to all motorists is equal to the increase in consumers' surplus 
which is the shaded area in Figure 8.14. This consists of two parts: 
 
â¢ a reduction in cost to the existing users of the road (the rectangular area A) 
â¢    the consumers' surplus to new users (the approximately triangular area B)

Figure 8.14 Increase in consumers' surplus of a duplicated highway. 
 
 
Note that the concept of revenue is not relevant in this problem, as the price is 
not paid to a producer but represents a resource cost to society. 
 
As a second example, the demand-supply situation for the provision of water 
to a city by a water authority is shown in Figure 8.15. The authority is considering 
constructing a new dam which would cause the supply curve to move to the right as 
shown, as the dam will increase the supply of water at any particular price. Assume 
that the authority sets the price of water equal to that which would apply in a 
competitive market situation.  
 
Under the existing situation, Q1 units of water are supplied per year at a price 
of P1. With the new dam in place, the price would fall to P2 and the volume supplied 
would increase to Q2. 
 
 
The benefits of the new dam will consist of the following:

consumers' surplus plus increase in revenue 
 
 
= (A+B) + [(C+D) - (A+C)] 
 
 
= (B+D) 
 
 
As shown in Figure 8.15 this is simply the increase in willingness-to-pay of 
the consumers. Assuming a linear demand curve it is given by 
 
  
total beneÏits = (Ü³à¬¶âÜ³à¬µ) Ã (Ü²à¬µ+ Ü²à¬¶)/2  
 
 
(8.24) 
 
 
If the increase in Q is small, P1 = P2 and Equation (8.24) becomes 
 
 
total beneÏits = (Ü³à¬¶âÜ³à¬µ) Ã Ü²à¬µ 
 
 
 
(8.25) 
 
 
i.e., total benefits  = increase in output  x market price 
 
 
 
Note that in the case of a large public authority (or a private monopoly) an 
increase in supply could be large enough to cause a price change. 
 
Now suppose the water authority does not charge the market price for water, 
but instead charges a price of P3 as set by the government (see Figure 8.16). If the 
initial quantity supplied is Q1 the authority would have to ration the water between 
consumers as the total demand Q3, at a price P3, exceeds the available supply Q1. 
This is common practice in the supply of water for irrigation purposes in which each 
irrigator has an annual allocation that cannot be exceeded under normal 
circumstances. 
 
With the existing supply curve and a rationed quantity Q1 the total 
willingness-to-pay is given by areas (A' + C'). This is composed of the 
authority's revenue (area C') and the consumers' surplus (area A'). The quantity 
Q1 (P1 - P3) is the difference between the revenue for the water under a 
competitive market system and the actual revenue. It represents a transfer

payment from the authority to the consumers as a result of the government 
pricing policy. 
 
 
Desalination benefits 
 
In 2006 the Israeli government was planning the construction of desalination plants 
to supplement the water supply for its people. While the costs were relatively easy 
to quantify, based on the cost of new plant, running costs due to electricity and the 
replacement of reverse-osmosis membranes, the benefits were more nebulous. 
However, by considering effects such as reduced scaling in pipes, extended 
lifetimes of electric and solar heaters, savings in soap in washing clothes and 
dishes, it was possible to determine a benefit of approximately US$0.11 /m3. When 
savings in pumping costs were taken into account, the total benefit rose to 
approximately US$0.15 /m3. 
 
Source: Dreizin, 2006 
 
 
 
Figure 8.16   Benefits of an increase in urban water supply under non-market pricing. 
 
 
If the supply curve shifts as a result of building a new dam and quantity Q2 is 
supplied at price P3, the increase in benefits will be the increase in consumers' 
surplus plus the increase in revenue, i.e. area (B' + D') in Figure 8.16. This is 
identical to the increase in willingness-to-pay given by (B + D) in Figure 8.15. 
Therefore, the government pricing policy does not affect the total benefits of the 
scheme, only the way in which these benefits are distributed between consumers 
and the water authority.

Humans to Mars? 
 
Ehlmann et al. (2005), in a paper promoting a mission to land humans on Mars, 
estimate the costs of such a venture at between US$20 billion and US$450 billion 
where the latter included using the moon as an intermediate staging post. With the 
costs firmly established, the challenge was to detail the benefits for such a mission. 
These, it was suggested, were to be found in the promotion of industry, 
engineering, technology and science. The authors put forward the US$85 billion 
satellite industry as a quantifiable benefit of previous space exploration and 
suggested that future work would contribute in similar ways. They also argued that 
the work would create new markets, allow for more efficient use of resources and 
create high-wage jobs. 
 
8.8 ECONOMIC COSTS  
The concept of cost is a subtle one which may cause confusion in some engineering 
studies. Essentially, the same concept of cost is applicable to public sector and 
private sector projects, although the question of cost to whom must be addressed. 
For the private sector, only costs incurred by the firm are of relevance, whereas for 
public sector projects the total cost to all members of society must be evaluated. The 
correct concept of cost is the incremental opportunity cost of resources used plus 
any externalities (for example pollution, social disruption) as a direct result of the 
project.  
 
The opportunity cost of a resource is its value when used in the best available 
alternative use. This is a measure of the value which must be forgone by using the 
resource in the project under consideration. The opportunity cost may be quite 
different from what was actually paid for the resource. 
 
For example, a company has a vacant block of land which is valued at 
$500,000 on the open market. The company paid only $100,000 for the land some 
10 years ago. If the company is considering building an office block on the land, the 
opportunity cost of the land is at least $500,000 because the land could be sold at 
this price. This is the cost which should be used in an economic evaluation of the 
proposed office block. The opportunity cost may be higher if a better alternative use 
is available. The actual price paid for the land is not relevant to this decision. 
 
As a further example of this concept, consider a contractor who has a crane 
which costs $500 per day to operate and which can be hired out for $1,000 per day. 
The opportunity cost to the contractor of using the crane on a particular construction 
project is $1,000 per day, as this is the benefit which he must forgo in order to use 
the crane. 
 
The opportunity cost concept has particular significance in public sector 
evaluation. If, for example, a project in the public sector employs labour which was 
previously unemployed, the opportunity cost of doing so is considerably less than 
the actual wage rate. As the alternative use of the labour is, in fact, unemployment, 
the opportunity cost is the value which the workers place on their additional 
recreation time when unemployed. The question of unemployment benefits paid to 

Economic Evaluation 
235 
 
the individual by the government does not enter the evaluation, as these are a 
transfer payment between one section of the community and another, i.e. the benefit 
of this payment to the unemployed equals the cost to the taxpayers, so its net effect 
on the total community is zero. 
 
The incremental or marginal costs of a project must be carefully assessed. In 
project evaluation, the marginal costs are the additional costs of undertaking the 
project compared with not undertaking it. There is sometimes a tendency to confuse 
marginal cost with average cost. The distinction between the two is illustrated by 
the following example.  
Worked example 
An engineer purchases a new car for $20,000. She uses the vehicle to commute to 
work and for recreational travel on weekends. The estimated annual costs for the 
vehicle are divided into standing costs (loss of interest on capital, depreciation, 
registration and insurance) which are estimated to be $8,200 p.a. and running costs 
(maintenance and repairs, petrol and oil, tyres) which are estimated to be $1,800 p.a. 
If she travels 20,000 km per year, the average cost of travel is $0.50/km 
($10,000/20,000 km). Now if her employer asks her to use her own vehicle to make 
a single trip of 50 km to a construction site, what is the cost of this trip? One 
possible answer would be to use the average cost of $0.50/km and thereby estimate 
a trip cost of $25. However, the extra trip is incremental to her private travel and 
therefore the incremental or marginal cost should be used. The registration and 
insurance costs and loss of interest on capital are unaffected by the extra trip and 
hence are irrelevant in this situation. Likewise depreciation is more strongly related 
to the ageing of the vehicle rather than distance travelled so it does not enter the 
calculation. The only incremental costs are petrol and oil, tyres, and maintenance 
and repairs (assuming these depend on distance travelled). Therefore, the marginal 
cost for a short trip is $0.09/km ($1,800/20,000 km). This gives a cost of $4.50 for 
the 50 km trip. If the engineer is reimbursed at the average cost of $0.50/km, she 
makes a nice profit on the trip.  
 
Now consider a different situation in which the engineer uses her car for 
15,000 km of business travel and 5,000 km of personal travel per year. It could be 
argued in this case that the vehicle is primarily for business purposes and the private 
travel is the marginal component. It would then be reasonable for the company to 
reimburse all standing costs of the vehicle as well as the running costs associated 
with the business travel. Alternatively, the company may provide a vehicle and ask 
the engineer to pay the running costs associated with private travel. 
Sunk and recoverable costs 
A further distinction needs to be made between sunk and recoverable costs. Sunk 
costs are costs which have been incurred in the past and are no longer recoverable. 
As such they are irrelevant to decisions about future actions.

Worked example 
A firm has a printer which originally cost $12,000 to purchase and now costs $2,500 
per year to operate and maintain. It can be sold for $5,000. An equivalent new 
printer costs $15,000, but it is estimated that it costs only $1,500 per year to run 
because of an attractive maintenance contract being offered by the manufacturer. 
What are the benefits and costs which should be considered in deciding whether or 
not to purchase the new printer? A time-frame of 5 years should be used in 
analysing the decision. At the end of this time the new printer is expected to be 
worth $4,000 and the old printer nothing. 
 
Solution We need to consider the incremental benefits and costs of the new printer 
relative to the old. These are shown in Figure 8.17. The incremental costs of 
purchasing the new printer is $10,000 ($15,000 minus the $5,000 sale value of the 
old printer). The incremental benefit is the $1,000 per year savings in operating cost 
plus the $4,000 value of the new printer at the end of 5 years. Note that the original 
purchase price of the old printer (i.e. the $12,000) is a sunk cost and does not enter 
the decision. Clearly the decision would be no different if the old printer had cost 
$100,000 or had been obtained for nothing.

8.9 COST ESTIMATION  
In the preparation of tenders, where engineering firms bid to undertake jobs, it is 
important to be able to estimate costs accurately. For example, the cost of a 
complete building, or the cost of installation of air conditioning, or in fact any of the 
many possible components that ultimately make up the total job. To assist in this 
process there are publications available that contain this type of information, taking 
into account the current year, the location of the proposed work and many other 
variables. These publications include:

The Building Construction Cost Data Book 74th Edition by R.S. Means 
(2016) that provides building cost data for 930 locations in the US and 
Canada

ï· 
Rawlinsons (2016) Australian Construction Handbook that provides 
construction cost data for all capital cities in Australia 
 
 
As an example of the types of information offered by these references, 
Rawlinsons (2016) contains estimates and detailed prices on the following: 
 
ï· 
whole buildings (based on area or usage); 
ï· 
electrical services (lighting, power, heating, closed circuit television 
installations, uninterruptable power supply); 
ï· 
mechanical services (air-conditioners, hot water convectors, water 
boilers, heat exchangers, pipe work, duct work, natural ventilation); 
and 
ï· 
civil services (excavation, laying concrete, installing structural steel). 
 
 
The 2016 edition of Rawlinsons, book also contains useful environmental 
information on topics such as green design, environmental management and the 
embodied carbon of various materials. 
 
The costs given are based on average values of actual contracts let in the 
preceding 12 months in the respective cities. It is difficult to summarise the full 
scope of the publication but some examples (current for 2016 prices) may assist in 
the process. 
 
ï· 
The price of a 300 to 500 seat cinema in suburban Adelaide that 
includes air conditioning, ancillary facilities, seats and projectors, etc. 
is between $7290 and $7860 per seat. Hence a 300-seat theatre would 
cost around $2.2 m. 
ï· 
To supply and install an evaporative air conditioner that meets a 
recommended 30 air changes per hour in a suburban house with 2.6 
metre (nominal) ceiling height in Perth would cost between $41 and 
$53 per square metre of floor area. 
ï· 
The supply and placing of an unreinforced strip footing in 25 MPa 
concrete in Melbourne costs $264 per cubic metre. 
ï· 
To supply and trench 300 mm diameter ductile iron cement lined 
(DICL) water supply pipe (PN 35) with rubber ring joints in Adelaide 
costs $325 per metre of length. 
ï· 
The installation of a set of traffic lights, including fully activated 
detectors, electrical services between signals, control box, pedestrian 
push buttons and indication signs to the intersection of an access road 
with a dual carriageway costs between $125,000 and $155,000 in 
Sydney.

8.10  SELECTION OF DISCOUNT RATE AND PROJECT LIFE  
The choice of the discount rate and project life may have an important influence on 
the economic viability of a particular project. Many engineering projects, for 
example roads, water supply, electricity supply and communications networks, 
involve high initial costs and benefits which grow steadily with time over many 
years. The computed NPV of such projects falls with increasing values of the 
discount rate, and may become negative for high values. For example, a proposed 
new highway will cost $10 m to construct. The benefits due to savings in operating 
costs and travel time are estimated to be $1.2 m in the first year of operation but will 
grow at 2% p.a. (compound) due to growth in the volume of traffic using the road. 
Maintenance costs are expected to be constant at $200,000 per year of operation. 
The NPV ($m) of the road for various values of life and discount rate can be 
calculated as follows:

The results are shown in Figure 8.18. Clearly, for any given value of the 
discount rate, the NPV increases with increasing values of project life. Also, for any 
given value of project life, the NPV decreases with increasing values of the discount 
rate. It should be noted that the economic desirability of the project depends 
strongly on the discount rate. For example, if i = 5%, NPV is positive provided the 
project life exceeds 12 years. On the other hand, for a value of discount rate of 15% 
the NPV is negative for all values of project life. For high values of discount rate, 
the NPV is relatively insensitive to changes in project life. For example, with a 
discount rate of 10% the NPV is $2.0 m if the project life is 35 years and $2.76m if 
the project life is 50 years. 
 
There has been considerable controversy associated with the selection of 
discount rate (and project life), particularly for public sector projects. For example, 
consider the case of a public authority which is required to justify all projects on an 
economic basis and only undertake projects which have a positive NPV. Clearly the 
list of economically viable projects will be much greater if the authority uses a low 
value of discount rate than if a high value is used. This fact has led to those who 
support large public works expenditure to argue for a low value of discount rate, 
whereas those who wish to reduce public works expenditure often argue for a high 
value. Before discussing this matter further, we shall consider the choice of discount 
rate for evaluating private sector projects

Figure 8.18 The effect of discount rate and life on the NPV of a road project. 
The discount rate in the private sector 
The correct concept for the discount rate is the opportunity cost of capital. The 
opportunity cost of capital for a particular company or individual at a particular 
point in time is the highest rate of return that it could obtain by having extra capital 
available. Obviously this depends on the investment opportunities at that time. 
Most companies raise their capital by a combination of borrowing from financial 
institutions (called debt capital) and reinvesting some of the company profits or 
retained earnings (called equity capital). In this case the opportunity cost of capital 
is a weighted average of the interest rate paid on debt capital and the rate of return 
that the shareholders could obtain by investing their capital to the best advantage 
elsewhere. This usually results in a higher rate than the interest paid on debt capital. 
The discount rate in the public sector 
As noted above, the choice of a discount rate in the public sector is often 
controversial. The three most common theoretical bases for the choice of a discount 
rate are 
 
ï· 
the average yield on long-term government bonds; 
ï· 
the social opportunity cost; and 
ï· 
the social time preference rate. 
 
 
As there is no agreed method, we shall consider the arguments for and against 
each one in turn.

The average yield on long-term government bonds 
It has been argued that the interest rate paid on long-term government bonds is the 
rate at which the government borrows money from the public. It is therefore 
appropriate that it should be used as the discount rate for evaluating public sector 
investments. In Australia, this rate is typically 1 to 2 % p.a. above the inflation rate. 
However, if we examine the federal budget as a whole, it is clear that most 
government revenue is raised by taxes, not by the sale of government bonds. In fact, 
bonds are used by the government to regulate the money supply rather than to raise 
revenue. The argument to link the discount rate to the government bond rate is 
therefore questionable. 
 
Another argument which supports the use of the long-term government bond 
rate is that this represents the risk-free interest rate in the private sector. Most 
investments carry some element of risk, due to uncertainties in the future economic 
climate. Even banks and building societies have been known to default on interest 
payments during major depressions. The interest on government bonds is 
guaranteed by the government and so carries no risk. Any private investment should 
return at least this interest rate, otherwise investors would withdraw their money and 
put it into government bonds. It is argued that it is therefore appropriate to use it for 
public sector investments. 
The social opportunity cost 
It is argued that funds invested by the government in major capital works have 
basically been displaced from the private sector and should, therefore, earn a rate of 
return at least as high as that prevailing in the private sector (based on the 
opportunity cost of capital concept). However, not all revenue raised by government 
taxation would have been invested in the private sector. In fact a high percentage of 
government revenue is taken from expenditure that would have gone into 
consumption and would produce no investment return. This fact must be taken into 
account when assessing the social opportunity cost. A further difficulty is in 
determining the appropriate marginal rate of return in the private sector. A typical 
rate for the social opportunity cost is 10â15% above inflation. 
The social time preference rate 
It is argued that, by undertaking investments in the public sector, society is 
effectively forgoing consumption in the current time period in order to achieve 
increased consumption in the future. The choice of a discount rate is equivalent to 
placing a weight on benefits and costs incurred in future years when compared with 
the present. Some economists consider that society is free to choose whatever 
stream of future consumption that it likes, and accordingly it may choose any set of 
relative weights on benefits and costs in future years.  
 
The discount rate corresponding to this chosen set of relative weights is the 
social time preference (STP) rate, which will in general differ from the interest rate 
prevailing in the private sector.  

Economic Evaluation 
241 
 
 
To illustrate the concept of a social time preference rate, suppose that society 
(or its elected representatives) decides that benefits and costs received in one year 
should have a weight W1 relative to benefits received in the present. Similarly, 
benefits and costs received in two years have a weight W2 relative to the present. In 
general, Wt is the weight placed on benefits and costs received at the end of year t 
relative to benefits and costs received in the present. (Clearly W0 = 1). 
 
 
Then the net community benefits (NCB) can be defined as: 
 
 
 
Ü°Ü¥Ü¤= â Ü¹à¯§ (Ü¤à¯§âÜ¥à¯§) 
 
 
 
 
(8.26) 
  
 
Based on the preference of most individuals to consume now rather than later, 
it is reasonable to assume that: 
 
 
 
W0 > W1 > W2 > â¦. , etc. 
 
 
A somewhat stronger assumption is that the weight placed on the benefits and 
costs in any particular year is a constant fraction of the weight placed on the benefits 
and costs in the previous year, i.e., 
 
 
 
Ü¹à¬µ= ÝÜ¹à¬´= Ý
Ü¹à¬¶= ÝÜ¹à¬µ= Ýà¬¶
â¯â¯â¯
Ü¹à¯§= ÝÜ¹à¯§à¬¿à¬µ= kà¯§
 
 
 
 
 
(8.27) 
 
 
where k is a chosen parameter between 0 and 1. 
 
 
Suppose we define k as follows: 
 
 
 
 Ý= 1/(1 + Ý)  
 
 
 
 
(8.28) 
 
 
where r is the social time preference (STP) rate. 
 
 
Combining Equations 8.26, 8.27 and 8.28 we obtain: 
 
 
 
NCB = ï { Bt / (1 +r)t  - Ct / (1+ r)t}  
 
 
(8.29) 
 
 
The similarity with Equation (8.17) should be noted. It should be clear that 
choosing the STP rate, r, is equivalent to choosing a set of weights on future 
benefits and costs for society as a whole. 
 
The STP rate may be any rate chosen by society (even 0%). Proponents of the 
STP rate usually argue for a low rate (in the order of 2â5%) on the grounds that 
government investments provide basic community infrastructure and therefore 
benefits over a long time scale should be considered.

Summary: Discount rate for public sector projects 
Ultimately, the choice of the discount rate for public sector projects tends to be a 
political decision. Often, sensitivity analyses are carried out in which the NPV for 
all projects is calculated using a low, medium, and high value of the discount rate. 
For example, the NPV of all projects can be determined using discount rates of 3, 6 
and 10% p.a. and the results compared. 
Project life 
Many engineers consider the life of an engineering project to be equal to the 
physical life of the constructed facilities. The physical life of a system ends when it 
can no longer perform its intended function. For example, a building is at the end of 
its physical life when it is no longer fit for habitation. A road pavement is at the end 
of its physical life when it is suffering total break-up and can no longer be repaired. 
However, two other concepts of project life are relevant in economic evaluation. 
These are the economic life and the relevant period of analysis. 
 
The economic life of an engineering system ends when the incremental 
benefits of keeping the system operating for one more year are less than the 
incremental costs of maintenance and repair for one more year. As most engineering 
systems can be kept operating almost indefinitely with suitable replacement parts, 
the economic life is usually less than the physical life. 
 
The relevant period of analysis is the maximum period beyond which the 
system performance has virtually no effect of its present value of benefits and costs. 
For high values of discount rate, the NPV of a project does not significantly increase 
beyond a certain time. This time is the relevant period of analysis. For example, if a 
discount rate of 15% p.a. is being used, it is pointless arguing whether the life of a 
building will be 30 years or 100 years as it will make no difference whatsoever in its 
economic evaluation. For lower values of discount rate, more care must be taken in 
choosing the project life. 
 
In general, the project life is the smallest of the physical life, the economic life 
and the relevant period of analysis. Some typical lives used for civil engineering 
projects are given in Table 8.9.

8.11 SUMMARY 
The aim of economic evaluation is to assess if the benefits of a project exceed its 
costs and hence whether or not it is worth undertaking from an economic 
perspective. The benefits and costs of a project need to be carefully defined as they 
do not necessarily correspond to cash flows, particularly in the public sector where a 
number of goods and services are supplied to the community at a subsidised price. 
 
The benefits and costs of engineering projects often occur over a long time 
period. Hence, the effects of the time value of money need to be taken into account 
in assessing the economic viability of a project. A discount rate is applied to future 
benefits and costs in recognition that they are less significant than benefits and costs 
incurred today. 
 
There are a number of economic criteria for evaluating projects. These include 
the payback period, net present value, equivalent annual worth, the benefit-cost ratio 
and the internal rate of return. In general, economists favour net present value as it 
is not sensitive to the issue of whether savings in cost should be counted as positive 
benefits or negative costs and it produces an unambiguous ranking of projects. 
 
The selection of the discount rate, particularly in the public sector, can be 
controversial and there are a number of bases for its selection. The social time 
preference rate is preferred as it is recognises that the choice involves social values 
that can be expressed through the political process.

8.10 As engineer for a company developing high efficiency solar panels, you have 
an annual research and development budget of $500,000. Each year you call for 
submissions from within the company for projects that could be done. As part of 
this, the proponents must estimate the cost of the proposal and what benefits would 
come from a successful outcome. This year you have eight proposals to consider, 
and one criterion for funding is economic benefits. The details of the proposals are 
given in Table 8.10. Any calculations that you do should assume a project life of 5 
years and a discount rate of 20% p.a.

may attempt to find a solution by inspection. As an additional exercise, set the 
problem up in EXCEL and use Solver to verify the solution obtained by hand.

8.12 A car that was purchased 10 years ago for $20,000 is now thought to be worth 
$5,000 as a trade-in on a new model. Due to its age, the old car now costs $2,000 
per year in repairs alone, which it is assumed a new car would not need. Based on 
economics, should a new car be purchased for $30,000 if it is intended to keep it 
and evaluate it over a 10-year planning horizon? Assume that at the end of the 10 
years a car purchased now would be worth $5,000 and the existing car would be 
worthless.

APPENDIX 
8A: 
PRICE 
DETERMINATION 
IN 
PERFECTLY 
COMPETITIVE MARKETS 
The perfectly competitive market is a theoretical model used by economists to 
analyse market behaviour in much the same way that engineers use free-body 
diagrams to analyse the forces on a group of rigid bodies. 
 
It is hypothesized that there is a market of buyers and sellers which 
determines the market price for any particular good or service (called a 
âcommodityâ). 
 
The assumptions inherent in the perfectly competitive market are as follows 
 
ï· 
there are a large number of buyers and sellers of the commodity 
ï· 
any particular commodity is identical for all sellers 
ï· 
all buyers and sellers have perfect information about prices and 
production costs 
ï· 
there is free entry and exit of firms into the market 
The market supply curve 
For any particular commodity there is a market supply curve which shows the 
total amount of the commodity which will be produced per unit time at any 
particular price. For example, Figure 8.19 shows the market supply curve for 
timber in a particular economy. (Note that it is traditional to plot price on the 
vertical axis.) As price increases, we would expect a greater production of 
timber as more producers come into the market and existing producers increase 
their output by working overtime, investing in new machinery, and so on.

Figure 8.19   Market supply curve for timber. 
 
 
Other factors apart from the price of the commodity can affect the quantity 
supplied. If these change, they will cause a shift in the position of the market 
supply curve in Figure 8.19. These factors are as follows: 
 
ï· 
The price of inputs (for example, labour or materials) to the 
production process 
ï· 
The price of competing outputs. For example, an oil refinery can be 
used to produce many products including petrol and fuel oil. If  the 
price of petrol increases relative to the price of kerosene, the 
market  supply curve for fuel oil would tend to shift to the left 
ï· 
The state of technology. Technological advances can reduce 
production costs and cause the market supply curve to shift to the right 
ï· 
The time period. The market supply curve for a short time period tends 
to be near vertical, as there is little time to respond to changes in price. 
In the longer term, the curve tends to be flatter, as there is more 
time for producers to respond to changes in price 
ï· 
Expectations. The quantity supplied at any particular price will 
depend on whether producers expect prices to increase, decrease or 
remain the same in the next time period 
The market demand curve 
 
 
For any particular commodity there is also a market demand curve. This 
shows the quantity per unit time of the commodity which would be purchased 
at any particular price. Figure 8.20 shows the market demand curve for timber in 
a particular economy. As the price of timber increases, we would expect the 
demand to fall as consumers use substitute materials such as plastic, steel, and 
aluminium.

Apart from price, a number of other factors affect the position of the 
market demand curve. These include the following: 
 
ï· 
The prices of other commodities. Certain commodities are substitutes 
for one another. Consider, for example, gas and electricity. If the 
price of gas increases, the market demand curve for electricity tends 
to shift to the right. Other commodities such as concrete and steel 
reinforcing rods are complementary goods. If the price of concrete 
increases, there is a shift to the left of the demand curve for steel 
reinforcing rods. 
ï· 
Income and wealth of consumers. If there is a general rise in 
income levels There is an increase in demand for all normal goods.  
This is reflected by a shift to the right of the demand curve. 
ï· 
Number of consumers. An increase in the number of consumers causes the 
market demand curve to shift to the right. 
ï· 
Tastes of consumers. Changes in taste and fashion may cause a shift in 
the demand curve for some commodities, e.g., clothing. 
ï· 
The time period and expectations. 
Market equilibrium 
The market price for any particular commodity in a perfectly competitive market 
is determined by the interaction of demand and supply. At equilibrium the 
market price corresponds to the point of intersection of  the market supply and 
market demand curves. This point is illustrated in Figure 8.21, where the 
equilibrium price is given by P* and the equilibrium quantity by Q*.

Figure 8.21 Demand-supply equilibrium. 
 
Suppose the price is set at a value greater than P*, for example P1. Then the 
quantity supplied, QS
1 exceeds the quantity demanded, QS
1. The product therefore 
stockpiles and there is pressure on producers to reduce the price in order to sell 
their product. If  the price is below P*  (e.g., P2),  the quantity demanded, QD
1 
exceeds the quantity  supplied,  QS
1,  and  there  are  shortages  of  the  commodity.  
In response to these shortages, consumers will tend to bid up the price of this 
scarce commodity. As the price increases, producers will tend to produce more 
and new producers will enter the market. 
 
At a price of P* the quantity demanded just equals the quantity supplied and 
an equilibrium state is established. 
 
For example, consider the demand/supply equilibrium of traffic on a 
section of urban arterial road. In this case, each consumer may decide either to make 
one or more trips on the road or not to use it at all. The price of a trip is the total cost 
of petrol, oil, and tyre wear of making one traverse of the section of road. To this 
should be added the value of travel time of the driver and passengers. The quantity 
is the number of vehicles per hour travelling on the road. 
 
Figure 8 . 2 . 2  shows supply and demand curves for the road. The supply 
curve indicates the total cost per trip as a function of the volume of traffic on the 
road in vehicles per hour. Typically, the cost per trip increases rapidly as the volume 
of traffic approaches the capacity of the road, C. This is due to the effects of 
traffic congestion and delays.

Figure 8.22 Demand-supply equilibrium for an urban arterial road. 
 
 
The demand curve in Figure 8.22 indicates the number of drivers per hour 
wanting to use the road as a function of the total cost per trip. As the cost per trip 
increases, fewer drivers wish to use the road because of available substitutes such 
as other routes of travel or other times of the day. If the traffic conditions on the 
road remain steady for a sufficient period of time, equilibrium is reached with a 
volume of Q* vehicles per hour on the road. The corresponding cost per trip is 
P* dollars. 
Shifts in demand and supply curves 
As mentioned earlier, the demand curve for a particular commodity may shift 
with time due to changes in consumer preferences, the number of consumers, 
average income levels or the prices of related goods. A shift in demand leads to a 
new equilibrium quantity and price for the commodity. For example, suppose the 
demand for water in a city increases due to an increase in population. This causes 
the demand curve for water to shift to the right as shown in Figure 8.23. If the 
water supply authority charges the market price for water, one would expect the 
volume supplied to increase from Q1 to Q2 and the price of water to increase 
from P1 to P2 as less economical sources of water are used. 
 
 In a similar fashion, the construction of a new engineering system causes the 
supply curve to shift to the right and a new equilibrium to be established. For 
example, in response to increasing demand, a water supply authority builds a new 
dam to supply water to a city. This causes the supply curve to shift to the right as 
more water can now be supplied at any particular price. The situation is shown in 
Figure 8.24. In equilibrium, the volume of water supplied increases from Q1 to Q2 
and the price falls from P1 to P2. In practice, this fall in price may take place over

Price elasticity of demand 
 
In planning future engineering facilities such as transportation and water resource 
systems, the analyst is often concerned with the responsiveness of consumers to 
changes in price. 
 
It is possible to characterize the price responsiveness of the market demand for 
a product at any point in time by its price elasticity of demand. This is defined as the 
percentage change in quantity demanded, divided by the percentage change in price, 
i.e. elasticity,

For example, the demand for water for irrigation from a particular river is 1.2 
x 109 m3 per year when the price of water is $0.10/m3. If the price increases to 
$0.15/m3 and the price elasticity of demand is -0.3, what will be the new demand?

0.01
= â0.18 Ã 10à¬½ m3/year 
 
 
New demand = 1.2 x 109 â 0.18 x 109 
 
 
         
= 1.02 x 109 m3/year 
 
 
 
Strictly speaking, the price elasticity defined by Equation (8.30) is the arc 
elasticity. In the limit as ïP approaches zero, it becomes the point elasticity. This is

For a downward-sloping demand curve the elasticity is negative. It is 
common to ignore the minus sign when quoting values of the price elasticity of 
demand. If the price elasticity of demand is less than minus one, the demand is 
said to be elastic, otherwise the demand is called inelastic. 
 
 
Some typical estimated values of price elasticities of demand of interest to 
engineers are given in Table 8.12. Note that the reported values cover a wide range 
which would depend on a number of factors including the location and the method 
of estimation.

CHAPTER NINE  
Sustainability, Environmental and Social 
Considerations 
 
This chapter explains how sustainability, environmental and social considerations 
inform the planning and design of engineering projects. The concept of 
sustainability and its assessment can be challenging. However, it can also be 
effectively used as a basis for the assessment of development and community 
projects. The concepts presented in this chapter allow for community values to be 
incorporated into decision making processes by placing an emphasis on the 
environmental and social implications of engineering projects. Methods for taking 
account of sustainability, social and environmental issues are briefly presented.  
9.1 INTRODUCTION 
Prior to the 1970s, engineering projects were often human-centric. Engineers 
focussed primarily on the technical and economic aspects of projects, without 
giving much concern to the social and environmental impacts of their work. To a 
large extent this was a reflection of the priorities of society at the time, and to a 
lesser extent, due to an insufficient understanding of the interconnectedness 
between engineering works and natural and social systems. Engineers now 
recognise that they play a critical role in the wise use, conservation and 
management of resources. They also recognise that they have an obligation to 
ensure that the needs of future generations are considered. This is reflected by 
professional bodies through accreditation requirements for engineering programs, 
and through codes of ethics for practising engineers.  
 
In 1828 Thomas Tredgold of the Institute of Civil Engineers described 
engineering as the art of directing the great forces of nature for the use and 
convenience of man. As we have seen already in Chapter 1, nature tended to be 
regarded as a powerful adversary to be tamed. Today such views are tempered by 
the realisation that the world has finite resources and the emphasis now is on the 
wise use of resources, not only to protect and conserve the environment, but also to 
achieve a sustainable way of life into the foreseeable future.  
 
The concept of sustainable development has been discussed extensively in 
past decades, with the mainstream definition being that of the Brundtland 
Commission of 1987 (WCED, 1987):  
 
Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the 
ability of future generations to meet their own needs. 
 
 

256 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
 
This concept has developed further, and engineering systems, policies, 
designs and plans can be considered and evaluated today within sustainability 
frameworks.  
 
In Section 9.2 of this chapter, we look at the concept of sustainability and in 
Section 9.3 at the techniques which are used by engineers in planning and design to 
deal effectively with sustainability as an over-riding goal of engineering work. 
While environmental and social issues are clearly inter-related with considerations 
of sustainability, they are dealt with separately in this chapter. Environmental 
considerations and assessment programs are introduced in Sections 9.4 and 9.5, 
while social issues and assessment tools are dealt with in Sections 9.6 and 9.7.  
9.2 SUSTAINABILITY  
The systems approach provides a simple and consistent basis for investigating 
sustainability at all levels of society, from the global scale down to the individual. 
Gilman (1992) used systems concepts to provide the following definition of 
sustainability: 
 
 The ability of a society, ecosystem, or any such ongoing system to continue 
functioning into the indefinite future without being forced into decline 
through exhaustion or overloading of key resources on which the system 
depends. 
 
 
Based on this definition, Foley et al. (2003) have shown that to achieve 
sustainability it is necessary to manage appropriately all the resources that a system 
relies on. These include the natural, the financial, the social and the man-made 
infrastructure resources that are important to the functioning of the system.  
 
Roberts (1990) has shown that self-sustaining systems in nature are generally 
closed-loop systems that evolved gradually over time. In the past when humans 
developed production systems, they have relied on an open loop, once-through use 
of resources, which results in much waste. To be sustainable, it is necessary to use 
closed-loop systems. This emphasis on a closed loop for sustainable outcomes can 
also be seen in discussions related to a circular economy. The objective of a circular 
economy is to maximise value at each point of a productâs life (Stahel, 2016). 
Another closed-loop system concept is the cradle to cradle approach. This approach 
is in contrast to the linear cradle to grave approach. The cradle to cradle approach 
recognises that the perceived end of life for a given product can, and should, 
become the start of another product life and therefore an interconnection is 
introduced between product life cycles. A cradle to grave approach also recognises 
the product life cycles, but often includes waste at the end of the product life. 
Figure 9.1 shows a conceptual model of the initial extraction or use of resources, 
followed by the processing, transportation and consumption of the modified 
resources as a closed-loop system that can evolve over time. More complex models 
include interconnected systems and cradle to cradle connections between product 
life cycles.

A key element of the model is the stewardship of the natural environment that 
is needed in order to provide a balance to the processes of extraction, modification 
and transportation. The main element of this closed-loop system is the recycling of 
waste from manufacture and consumption within a continuous loop. Energy inputs 
are a crucial element in the closed-loop system. For many natural systems the sun is 
the natural source of energy, but this is not so for man-made systems. 
 
A conceptual model that can be used to assess the sustainability of a system or 
of sustainable system development (Foley et al., 2003) is shown in Figure 9.2. It 
outlines the flow of resources within the system. The model identifies infrastructure 
and other human-made resources (I) as a key element of sustainability. 
Infrastructure for urban development includes buildings, and the water supply 
system, as well as systems for waste, transport and energy. Such a systems 
approach provides a good platform for assessing development and sustainability, 
where infrastructure and resource flow are principal considerations. 
 
Each subsystem within the larger development system can be modelled (e.g. a 
single house within a city development). The flow of resources such as water, 
energy and finance to and from the system can also be included in a more holistic 
way than in many other currently available tools. 
 
A systems approach to the assessment of sustainability is not new. It was 
applied in early computer modelling studies in the 1970s (e.g. Meadows, et al., 
1972) and in more quantitative studies which have continued up to the present. A 
major conclusion from such systems modelling, suggested by Suter (1999), is âthat 
humankind needs to re-evaluate its exploitative attitude towards humans and the 
earth itselfâ.

Another application of the term sustainability relates to corporate social 
responsibility. This can impact engineers and their work through both the strategic 
direction and the investment decisions of the organisations within which they are 
employed or interact. Sustainability has been adopted in the business world to 
connote the principles of social and environmental responsibility. Increasingly 
business organisations have recognized that profits alone do not guarantee 
continuity of existence for their companies and that sustainability adds to their long-
term business viability. Investors also see sustainability issues, such as controlling 
greenhouse gases, as priority concerns to be addressed by management. Since the 
late 1990s, the Global Reporting Initiative (www.globalreporting.org) has set the 
benchmark for sustainability reporting at the corporate level and the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Index (www.sustainability-indices.com) has become a mainstream 
investment consideration.  
 
The final application of the term sustainability, as discussed here, relates to 
considerations of natural capital. Schmidheiny (1992) of the World Business 
Council on Sustainable Development suggested that population growth and 
economic development will eventually be constrained by environmental and social 
pressures. The question of what level of population is sustainable for the world is 
the focus of much debate amongst many scientific researchers and has been since 
the time of Thomas Malthus in the late 1700s. The key to the answer is in 
maintenance of natural capital and the level of resource use which is required for a 
standard of living that can be perpetuated for future generations. Sustainability has 
thus been explained as being the state for which all social well-being and 
development are within the Earthâs biological capacity (Wackernagel and Rees, 
1997).

Club of Rome 
 
The Club of Rome was founded in 1968 and has been described as "a think tank 
and a centre of research and action, of innovation and initiative". It is composed 
of a group of scientists, economists, business people, senior public servants, 
heads of state and former heads of state from around the globe and addresses 
questions confronting the global society. The term "problematique" was 
developed by club members for the inter-related issues that were to be examined. 
The Club of Rome commissioned the book "Limits to Growth" which was 
published in 1972. Twelve million copies of the book were sold worldwide, in 37 
languages. The book challenged a basic assumption of economic theory that the 
resources of planet Earth could be infinite. The book was based on computer 
modelling of the consequences of the growth of global population. Various 
scenarios researched pointed to a major economic crisis occurring in the early 
1990s. This did not happen. Subsequent updates on the book have been 
undertaken and in retrospect, one needs to ask, was "Limits to Growth" a fair or a 
false warning?  
 
 
 
Adapted from Suter (1999) 
  
9.3 PLANNING AND DESIGN FOR SUSTAINABILITY  
Time is a key consideration for sustainability as systems evolve and communities 
develop. This was highlighted by Fleming (1999) who has suggested that 
sustainability needs to be considered within cycles of continuous improvement. In 
evaluating the sustainability of engineering systems, projects, processes and 
operations, a key aspect to consider is the stream of resource usage. Various tools 
can assist in such evaluations, and are dependent on the level of society to which 
they are being applied. Examples of readily available tools available on the Internet 
are listed in Table 9.1. Some are produced by non-government organisations, some 
represent formal government reporting and others are project specific or proprietary 
tools.  
 
The continuous improvement methods employed by industry, such as cleaner 
production and total quality management, evaluate the level of goal achievement 
over time. Many of these approaches use a systems approach to examine resources 
so that there is minimal waste with the conversion of linear, once-through systems, 
to closed-loop systems that reduce waste. These are mainly improvement processes 
used by industry to become more sustainable at a particular industry level, as well 
as processes used by governments to align with agreed global initiatives and 
principles. In 1992, the first set of guiding principles emphasizing sustainable 
development, Agenda 21, were agreed to at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. In 
2000, eight Millennium Development Goals were declared, and in 2015 countries 
adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals. These principles and goals are not an 
assessment of sustainability in their own right. They inform assessments and 
provide direction.

Sustainability, Environmental and Social Considerations 
261 
 
 
In many governments and organizations, a set of sustainability criteria are 
used to assess the relative merits of projects, processes and products. Included 
within these assessments is often interaction with the stakeholders and community 
groups through participatory and consultation programmes.  
 
A major push for reduction of the use of resources comes in programmes such 
as Factor 10, which has the goal to lower the use of natural resources for generating 
material wealth, using new technology, by an average factor of ten within 30 to 50 
years for the purpose of approaching sustainability. This is equivalent to increasing 
resource productivity tenfold over the same time period (Schmidt-Bleek, 1993). 
Sustainability assessment requires the development of a clear set of criteria against 
which the assessment can be conducted. This includes considerations of 
environmental, economic and social factors. The Triple Bottom Line (TBL) 
approach establishes individual indicators to show how well a company satisfies 
goals in each of these three areas. Usually for TBL reporting indicators are chosen 
for a number of criteria for each factor and then presented using a set of bars of 
different colours or stars to indicate how well a company is doing against particular 
criteria. The establishment of principles-based criteria for assessment of 
sustainability can improve the standard TBL approach.  
 
A framework for assessing the natural capital within a region or within an 
organization can be developed with the use of systems such as the âCompass index 
of sustainabilityâ to stress the inter-connected nature of the elements of 
environment, economics, and social well-being (AtKisson and Hatcher, 2001; 
Hargroves and Smith, 2005). Over time, the results of the planning and engineering 
of cities are measured by such indicators. Predictions of changes to the 
development of the city infrastructure and the resource input and output for a cityâs 
existence can also be made against these criteria. The design of individual buildings 
involves choices of materials to be used, lighting, air conditioning and water use. 
Each of these choices for achieving sustainability goals will involve assessment of 
embodied energy within materials used, energy use over the life of products, the 
ability of the product to be recycled and satisfaction of performance criteria. 
 
Sustainability 
assessment 
does 
not 
replace 
Environmental 
Impact 
Assessments or functional decision making based on Life Cycle Analysis or Social 
Impact Analyses or combinations thereof. A sustainable assessment tool needs to be 
incorporated within the decision-making framework to ensure that decisions in 
planning are, in fact, sustainable (Pope et al., 2004). Sustainability assessment can 
and should be applied to evaluating proposed and existing processes and projects at 
all levels of governmental and project decision making. Incorporating sustainability 
through the design and implementation phases of a development could involve the 
integration of social and environmental effects of a longer time horizon into 
analyses by the proponents of projects. Sustainability assessment requires defining 
clear societal goals (e.g. the Sustainable Development Goals) which can be 
translated into criteria, against which assessment is conducted. It is essential that the 
assessment method is able to discern sustainable outcomes from unsustainable ones.

Ecological Footprint 
 
Ecological Footprint (EF) is a measure of humanityâs dependence on natural 
resources. For a certain population or activity, the EF measures the amount of 
productive land and water required to sustain the current level of resource usage 
for the production of goods and services and the assimilation of waste required by 
that population or activity. 
 
In 2001, the world average EF was 2.55 global hectares per person, >30% 
above the current global capacity (Venetoulis and Talberth, 2005). The lifestyle of 
the average global citizen can therefore be considered as unsustainable. Natural 
resources are being used faster than they can be regenerated.  
 
The size of an EF can change over time, depending on population, 
consumption levels, technology and resource use. EFs are measured in global 
area (hectares or acres). Wackernagel et al. (1997) defined biologically 
productive areas as (a) arable land; (b) pasture; (c) forest; (d) sea space (used by 
marine life); (e) built-up land; and (f) fossil energy land (land reserved for carbon 
dioxide absorption). The current global biologically productive area is 10.8 billion 
hectares, of which 21% is productive ocean and 79% is productive land. This 
represents less than one-quarter of the Earth's surface.  
 
An individual's resource consumption is not restricted to local resources. 
The resources used by an individual are from around the world, clothes from 
China, cars from Korea and food from many different places. From a comparison 
of the Ecological Footprint to the existing biologically productive area, the 
sustainability of an activity, lifestyle or population can be determined.  
 
An ecological footprint of Greater London, prepared by Best Foot Forward 
Ltd. (http://www.citylimitslondon.com/) found that London's EF was 42 times the 
current capacity, or 293 times the size of London. This equated to 49 million 
global hectares, twice the size of the UK, and roughly the same size as Spain. Is 
this sustainable?  
 
Australia has a usage of 7.0 global hectares per person, making it the 5th 
highest in the world. There are many websites that enable calculation of your 
individual footprint on the earth (http://www.footprintnetwork.org/), and to compare 
it with different countries.  
 
 
  
 
The Matrix Evaluation of Sustainability Achievement is one such method 
(Fleming and Daniell, 1995; UNEP, 2002) which uses a weighting technique 
against a set of sustainability criteria and combines them with fuzzy set analysis. 
The important step is the definition of specific criteria which can be obtained to 
achieve the overall project goal. In the case of a building, this might be to achieve a 
reduction of 50% of projected CO2 emissions over an existing conventional design. 
Therefore, the inclusion of sustainability as a project goal could totally change the 
final solution from that resulting from a short-term economic goal.

Global Reporting Initiative 
 
The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) provides a reporting framework for 
companies and organisations to guide the preparation of consistent and 
comparable sustainability reports. First released in 1997, the GRI has been 
progressively developing resources as awareness of, and expectations 
associated with, corporate sustainability reporting have increased. GRI gained 
legitimacy in 2002 when it became a collaborating centre with the United Nations 
Environment Program (UNEP). It is aligned with the International Standard ISO 
26000:2010, Guidance on social responsibility and also now with the United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The GRI G4 guidelines will be phased 
out in 2018 and replaced by a series of standards. These standards are modular 
and define disclosure requirements using the following structure: 
 
ï· 
General Disclosures 
ï· 
Management Approach 
ï· 
Economic Standards 
ï· 
Environmental Standards 
ï· 
Social Standards 
 
In addition, there is a Foundation Standard and Glossary as supporting 
material.

9.4 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS 
History of Environmental Concerns 
While it is true that the environment and sustainability have become much more of 
a focus for concern among people since the 1970s, it would be quite wrong to think 
that prior to that time there were no problems and concerns. In ancient Greece some 
2500 years ago, Plato lamented the consequences of excessive logging and grazing 
in the mountainous region of Attica, near Athens. Similar concerns were raised 
around 1000 years ago in Japan where excessive eroded granite built up in Lake 
Biwa, due to logging for the construction of a temple (Parker, 1999).  
 
Environmental legislation also dates from ancient times. In Rome all wheeled 
vehicles were prohibited between sunrise and two hours before sunset to improve 
the situation for pedestrians. This law fell into disuse, and in the 3rd Century AD, 
writers complained about the level of noise pollution generated by traffic in the 
streets. The city of Florence had laws governing the polluting of the rivers Arno, 
Sieve, and Serchio as early as 1477 (Higgins and Venning, 2001) and in 1810 
Napoleon was issuing decrees aimed at eliminating polluting industries from the 
centres of cities.  
 
In Australia, some of the earliest laws dealt with environmental issues. There 
were laws to protect the quality of the stream which supplied water for the original 
settlement in Sydney and it was prohibited to fell trees within 50 feet (15 metres) of 
the stream. People were not allowed to throw rubbish into the stream or have 

264 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
pigsties within a prescribed distance. In 1839, just three years after the city of 
Adelaide was settled, the state of the Torrens River was so bad that laws were 
passed to prevent, among other things, people driving cattle through it. This was the 
cityâs only water supply and yet it was treated with scant regard by many. There are 
many countries today where this still happens but, as the world becomes more 
urbanised, there is a need to be aware of the impact of human activity on the state of 
the planet Earth. 
The Tragedy of the Commons  
The tragedy of the commons has played itself out worldwide at various times and to 
varying degrees. It can be explained as follows: when a group of herdsmen have 
access to a common pasture, it is in each individualâs best interests to increase the 
size of their herd without reference to the overall carrying capacity of the land. 
However, this leads to the destruction of the common pasture, so that everyone 
loses. This type of situation occurs in many ways, such as when an increasing 
population results in increased waste disposal into the commons: rivers, lakes, 
oceans, and atmosphere.  
 
A major issue in city development involves the concept of the commons in 
regard to the decreasing quality of air and water due to emissions from transport 
systems and runoff from road systems. Another issue linked to the commons on a 
global scale is the consumption of energy by the developed nations which has 
resulted in producing CO2 emissions which have contributed to global warming. 
Those activities that are considered to be necessary for a high quality of life: food; 
energy and transport systems; communication systems; the supply of infrastructure; 
supply and maintenance of water and waste water systems; health systems; and the 
management of waste all need energy and hence generate CO2 emissions. There is 
much discussion on the linkages between CO2 production, climate change and 
quality of life. The linkage between the use of energy and the quality of life can be 
examined by inspection of emissions of CO2 and energy use in industrialised 
countries in the world. The United Nations Human Development Index (HDI) is a 
measure of poverty, literacy, education, life expectancy, childbirth, and other 
factors for countries worldwide. It is a means of measuring well-being and has been 
used since 1993 by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP, 2013). 
To compare the impacts of development across nations with respect to emissions, 
the Human Development Index (HDI) has been used in conjunction with CO2 
emissions per capita as given in Table 9.2.

Energy Use 
Energy use in developing nations is based on traditional systems of wood and coal, 
and not electricity. As these nations convert to electricity and develop industries that 
use more energy, there will be a major increase in CO2 production across the globe. 
The growth in energy use of the developing nations is only just beginning and can be 
expected to increase twenty fold in the next 20â30 years. The need to develop better 
technologies for the sustainability of cities and lower CO2 emissions are two goals 
which engineers need to address if there is to be equity among nations. 
 
Of course the future cannot be predicted with certainty, but engineers will help 
create it. The goals that are now chosen for all development will dictate the future. In 
the past, individual goals were pursued independently of each other, leading to the 
present crises for social well-being, the environment and the economies of some 
countries. The need is to develop a balance between the use of resources, the 
environment, and social well-being to achieve sustainability into the future. 
9.5 ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT PROGRAMS AND TECHNIQUES 
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is now an integral part of the planning of 
an engineering project, just as economic, financial and social issues and technical 
analyses are. A definition of EIA that looks at the consequences is as follows: 
âEnvironmental Impact Assessment is a tool designed to identify and predict the 
impact of a project on the bio-geophysical environment and on societyâs health and 
well-being, to interpret and communicate information about the impact, to analyse 
site and process alternatives and provide solutions to sift out, or abate/mitigate the 
negative consequences on man and the environmentâ (UNEP, 2003). 

266 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
 
Numerous countries have implemented EIA regulations from the late 1960s 
onwards. The origin of EIA stems from the National Environmental Policy Act 
1969 (US), from which the practice has spread around the world. The Environment 
Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 (Commonwealth of Australia) was the 
first dedicated EIA legislation in the world and has now been replaced by 
Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Commonwealth 
of Australia). Within Australia there is also state legislation. For example, in 
Victoria the Environment Protection Act 1970 provides the legislative framework 
for environment protection in Victoria, but it is supplemented by other acts such as 
the Environmental Effects Act of 1978 for performing Environmental Effects 
Assessment. 
 
EIA is thus the means of including environmental factors with both economic 
and technical considerations at the planning stage of a project. The process of EIA: 
 
ï· 
identifies the potential environmental effects of undertaking a project; 
ï· 
presents these environmental effects with the advantages and disadvantages of 
the proposed project to the decision makers; and 
ï· 
forces stakeholders to consider the environmental effects and informs the public 
of the project while giving them the opportunity to comment on the proposed 
project.  
 
 
EIAs are necessary for large projects and are required under relevant planning 
legislation. They are necessary for mining projects, new transport corridor projects, 
major infrastructure development, large industrial factories or expansion of existing 
facilities. The EIA is a means of highlighting potential environmental and 
ecological disturbances which would be more difficult and more expensive to 
correct after their occurrence than before. One major benefit of EIAs is the 
assessment of habitats of many rare species of flora and fauna which might never 
have been investigated had it not been for the requirement of the EIA. 
 
In project planning, environmental issues are now addressed at all stages of 
the planning process, from conception to closure and rehabilitation. There are 
alternatives that can be considered at an early stage to counter adverse assessments, 
such as: 
 
ï· 
abandoning a project or a process; 
ï· 
proposing alternatives to projects which have extreme detrimental impacts on 
the environment; and 
ï· 
proposing alternatives for projects not economically or financially viable. 
 
 
Very few projects have been deemed not viable merely because of increased 
costs of environmental controls. For example, at a new paper pulp mill the 
additional cost has been assessed to be less than 3% of the initial investment 
(UNEP, 2003). The environmental controls that need to be put in place will vary 
from industry to industry, with significantly higher costs for some industries. Major 
research projects are being undertaken on the sequestering of carbon dioxide from 
energy production. A detailed assessment of the practices and methods involved in 
EIAs is contained in Canter and Sadler (1997) but the key elements of an EIA 
include:  

Sustainability, Environmental and Social Considerations 
267 
 
 
ï· 
Scoping: identify key issues and concerns of interested parties;  
ï· 
Screening: decide whether an EIA is required based on information collected;  
ï· 
Identifying and evaluating alternatives: list alternative sites and techniques and 
the impacts of each;  
ï· 
Forwarding measures that deal with risks and uncertainties of the proposed 
project and to minimise the potential adverse effects of the project; and  
ï· 
Issuing a report called an environmental impact statement, which covers the 
findings of the EIA. 
Environmental Impact Statements (EISs)  
The EIA process produces a document, called the EIS, which provides information 
on the existing environment and predictions about the environmental effects which 
could flow from the proposal. Whether an EIS is to be done in its entirety or 
whether some other report is warranted by the proposal is decided by government 
legislation. In South Australia there is an independent statutory authority, the Major 
Developments Panel, which controls the level of reporting required: an 
Environmental Impact Statement which is required for the most complex proposals; 
or a Public Environmental Report which is required for a medium level of 
assessment, sometimes referred to as a âtargeted EISâ; or a Development Report 
required for the least complex level of assessment.  
 
The EIS is the document that reports the findings of the EIA and, depending 
on each countryâs legislation, is now often required by law before a new project can 
proceed. A typical EIS has three parts with different levels of detail: an Executive 
Summary in a style that can be understood by the public; the main document 
containing relevant information regarding the project; and a volume containing the 
detailed assessment of significant environmental effects. If there are no significant 
effects either before or after mitigation, this volume will not be required. The EIS 
should 
 
ï· 
describe the proposed action as well as alternatives; 
ï· 
predict the nature and magnitude of the environmental effects; 
ï· 
identify the relevant human concerns; 
ï· 
list the impact indicators and determine the total environmental impact; and 
ï· 
make recommendations for inspection procedures and alternatives to the plan. 
 
 
As part of the EIA, as shown in Figure 9.3, there is usually a review of the 
EIS by the public and government to consider its accuracy and to recommend 
whether the proposal should go ahead or not. Different authorities and governments 
at the local, state or federal level have their own processes and procedures 
indicating timeframes for each review. 
 
The EIS is normally carried out by the developer or proponent of the proposed 
development. The developer generally uses a consulting firm that would assemble a 
multi-disciplinary team to undertake the EIS. Although it might be argued that the 
developer might be biased, there are advantages in that the developer must pay for 
the EIS to be carried out, and since the developer has the relevant information it is 
more efficient for the developer to undertake the EIS. There is also the advantage  

268

that the proponent can modify the design to reduce adverse impacts during the 
preparation of the EIS. 
 
Most governments have regulations regarding EIAs and the reporting thereof, 
and give a formal procedure for the requirement of an EIA. For any significant 
project, an EIA would be required as part of the process of getting development 
approval. Generally a preliminary investigation, feasibility or scoping stage is 
performed prior to an EIA. It is very difficult to compare projects in terms of their 
environmental and social effects because of the many diverse factors involved. This 
contrasts with an economic comparison in which a single criterion such as NPV 
(see Chapter 8) gives an unambiguous ranking of projects. A number of techniques 
have been developed to assist in evaluating environmental and social factors. Some 
of these are listed in Table 9.3. Two of these that will be discussed here are the 
Battelle environmental index method and the Leopold matrix display technique. 
The Battelle method is a checklist method that uses scoring and weights. The 
Battelle and the Leopold methods have both been in use for many years. They are 
discussed here in order to illustrate the fundamental aspects of environmental 
assessments. Advanced modelling techniques allow greater complexity in 
assessments and modelling of scenarios. 
The Battelle method 
The Battelle method or Environmental index method was first designed for water 
resource development, (Dee et al., 1972; Dee et al., 1973; Martel and Lackey, 1977) 
but can be adapted for evaluation of a variety of types of projects. The principle lies 
in splitting the environmental impacts into four major categories: ecology; 
physical/chemical pollution; aesthetics; and human interest. These categories are 
divided into thematic data, as shown in Table 9.4. The full list is included in 
Appendix 9A.

These thematic data are divided into environmental indicators. For example, 
in a project discharging wastewater, the water pollution could be represented by: 
BOD; dissolved oxygen; faecal coliforms; inorganic carbon; pH; temperature; total 
dissolved solids; and turbidity of the receiving water and/or of the waste stream.

Once the environmental indicators are chosen using Appendix 9A, the method 
follows three steps: 
 
 
Step 1: transform environmental indicators into an environmental quality (EQ) 
rank. This usually requires expert advice to convert the environmental measurement 
to a scale of 0 to 1 (0 for poor quality and 1 for good quality). It is then possible to 
quantify environmental deterioration or improvement for the given project. A 
sample transformation is shown in Figure 9.4 for turbidity measured in 
Nephelometric Turbidity Units, transformed to the environmental quality index 
between 0 and 1. 
Figure 9.4 Environmental quality transformation. 
 
 
Step 2: use the distributed Parameter Importance Units (PIU) which were 
developed by Dee et al. (1972). The relative importance of each parameter is 
reflected by distributing a total of 1,000 points among the indicators (e.g., a total of 
240 for Ecology). 
 
Step 3: complete the analysis for both the situation with and without the 
project in Environmental Impact Units (EIU). It can even reflect benefits or losses 
in terms of environmental conditions. The environmental impact is calculated 
using:

where Vi is Environmental Quality (EQ) for each indicator i; the 1 subscript refers 
to the EQ with the project, and the 0 to the EQ without the project; wi is the relative 
weight of indicator i; and m is the total number of indicators. 
 
An advantage of this method is that it gives a comparative analysis of 
alternatives. Therefore, it is effective when a choice is to be made between projects. 
The problem of dealing with qualitative data is encountered in all assessments, and 
synthesis of information depends on the experience and professional judgement of 
the team undertaking the assessment and the stakeholders who have been consulted.

The Leopold matrix display technique 
Matrix display techniques use a large matrix to summarize the environmental and 
social impacts of a proposed project, which may be given in a quantitative form. 
The Leopold matrix (Leopold et al., 1971) is an example. A disadvantage of the 
matrix display technique is that it can become difficult for users to absorb all of the 
information contained in the matrix. 
 
The matrix lists a set of project actions in the first row and a set of 
environmental characteristics in the first column. Part 1 of Table 9.7 in Appendix 
9A lists the project actions, while Part 2 lists the environmental characteristics. 
Other actions or environmental characteristics can be added as appropriate to give 
over 8800 possible interactions. For any project only some of the possible 
interactions will be relevant, but the actions and environmental characteristics do 
provide a useful checklist to ensure that all possible effects have been considered. 
 
Each cell of the matrix for which an impact is likely to occur is identified and 
indicated by a diagonal line. An assessment is then made of the magnitude of the 
likely impact and a number between 1 and 10 is placed in the upper left-hand 
corner, with 1 representing the smallest magnitude and 10 the greatest (Leopold et 
al., 1971). This should be a factual assessment and not a value judgement. A 
number between 1 and 10 is placed in the lower right-hand corner of each cell to 
indicate the importance of the impact. This is a value judgement made by the 
evaluator. Leopold used the example of a proposal for the construction of highways 
and bridges. One consideration was that bridges may cause a large amount of bank 
erosion because geologic materials in an area are poorly consolidated. This may 
lead to the evaluator marking the magnitude of impact of highways and bridges on 
erosion at 6 or more. However, if the streams involved have high sediment loads 
and appear to be capable of carrying such loads without appreciable secondary 
effects, the effective importance of bridges through increased erosion and 
sedimentation will be relatively small and so marked as 1 or 2 in the lower right 
hand of the box. This would mean that while the magnitude of impact is relatively 
high, the importance of impact is not great.  
 
Of course a matrix is just one example of summarizing the environmental 
impact of a proposed project. It must be supported by an environmental impact 
statement which discusses all impacts identified in the matrix. For example, Figure 
9.5 shows a reduced impact matrix for a proposed phosphate mining lease in Los 
Padres National Forest, California (Leopold et al., 1971). The mining was to be an 
open-cut operation with ore processing on site, including crushing, leaching, and 
neutralization. The most important impact of the proposal was identified as the 
likely effect on the California condor, a rare and endangered species which exists in 
the region. The primary actions of concern were blasting and the increase in truck 
traffic, both of which were likely to disturb the nesting of the condor. In addition, 
sulphur fumes from mineral processing could have prevented the birds from landing 
to catch prey and hence present a danger to them. 
 
These effects are shown in the row labelled ârare and unique speciesâ as 
having a magnitude of 5 and an importance of 10. Other effects considered to be of 
moderate importance include the impact of industrial sites and buildings, highways 
and bridges, surface excavation, trucking, and the placement of tailings on the 
âwilderness qualitiesâ of the area. The values in the boxes of a Leopold matrix are 
on an ordinal scale and cannot therefore be added or averaged. However, two or 

272 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
more projects can be compared in terms of the entries in an individual cell in the 
matrix to see which project will have the greater impact on that particular 
characteristic. Another approach, which avoids the use of numbers, is to use colour 
coding of the rankings and highlight those of importance with red flags.

Multi-objective and multi-criteria assessment approaches 
Multi-objective approaches have been developed to quantify economic, 
environmental and social aspects of a project. These methods use data in an 
integrated way and have the capability of dealing with trade-offs among objectives.  
 
Sustainability principles have yet to permeate the full range of methods and 
techniques used for project evaluation and assessment but they are becoming 
increasingly important. In planning and design situations where more than one 
objective is relevant, it is not usually possible to identify a single best solution. A 
design which is better in terms of its economic performance might not be as good in 
terms of its environmental and social impact. A design which has low environmental 
impact may involve low economic and social benefits. Compromise is the essence of 
good planning and design and is reflected in the push towards sustainability. 
 
The role of the evaluator in multiple objective planning is to identify the most 
efficient designs (in terms of all objectives) and elucidate the tradeoffs between 
them. A central concept is that of inferior and non-inferior designs or plans. An

example, using two objectives, may be a project where national economic 
development and environmental quality are considered as the objectives. Using 
these objectives, all feasible designs for a project could be evaluated and plotted in 
two-dimensional space, as shown in Figure 9.6.

Figure 9.6 Multi-objective trade-off between alternatives. 
 
 
By definition, an alternative A is inferior to alternative B if B ranks higher or 
equal to A for all objectives and higher for at least one objective. If A ranks higher 
than B for one objective and B higher than A for another, they are both non-inferior 
(for this pairwise comparison).  
 
In Figure 9.6 design X is clearly inferior to design Y and can be discarded 
from further analysis. Designs Y or Z are non-inferior to each other and should 
therefore both be retained in the evaluation. Designs which are not inferior to any 
other are called ânon-inferiorâ designs. A line joining all non-inferior designs is 
called the âPareto Optimal frontierâ or âtransformation curveâ (or âtransformation 
surfaceâ if there are more than two objectives). The transformation curve represents 
the boundary between feasible and infeasible designs in objective space.  
 
The preferred design should lie on the transformation curve, provided all 
relevant objectives have been included in the analysis. The choice of a final design 
involves a value judgment as to the relative importance of the objectives and, in 
many cases, will involve a political decision.  
 
The role of the evaluator in multiple objective planning is to identify the most 
efficient designs in terms of the objectives, and recognize the trade-offs among 
them. There are many techniques and software available for different applications 
and further considered in Section 12.7. An example of the development of a Multi- 
Objective Decision Support System (MODSS) for transport situations is described 
in some detail in Thoresen et al. (2001).  
9.6 SOCIAL IMPACT 
The environmental impact statement usually includes social impacts as well as 
effects on the physical and biological components of the environment. On the other 

274 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
hand, the USA Principles and Standards for Planning Water and Related Land 
Resources (USWRC, 1973) considered social well-being as a separate category of 
objectives. The social objective was defined as follows:  
 
To enhance social well-being by the equitable distribution of real income, 
employment and population, with special concern for the incidence of the 
consequences of a plan on affected persons or groups; by contributing to the 
security of life, health and property; by providing educational, cultural and 
recreational opportunities; and by contributing to national security. 
(USWRC, 1973) 
  
 
If a full economic, environmental and social evaluation of a project is carried 
out, it is most important to avoid the double-counting of benefits or costs under 
more than one account. If, for example, an economic value is placed on lives saved 
through accident reduction and this is included in the economic evaluation of the 
project, it would not be appropriate to also highlight the number of lives saved in 
the social evaluation. Other examples of double-counting are discussed later in this 
section.  The following types of social effects may need to be considered for a 
particular project:  
 
ï· 
distribution of income;  
ï· 
population distribution; 
ï· 
employment; 
ï· 
life, health, and safety; 
ï· 
educational, cultural, and recreational opportunities; 
ï· 
national security and emergency preparedness; 
ï· 
displacement and relocation; and 
ï· 
neighbourhood disruption and intrusion. 
 
As with environmental effects, each social parameter can have its own ordinal or 
cardinal scale of measurement. The above effects are considered in turn.  
Distribution of Income 
In theory it is possible for a government to redistribute the benefits and costs of any 
public sector project among the various individuals or groups in society. This being 
the case, it can be argued that the role of the engineer or planner is to devise 
projects which maximise the total net benefits to the community and let the 
government decide how these benefits (and costs) will be distributed. However, this 
redistribution of benefits and costs is often not practicable because of the 
difficulties in identifying all affected groups and because of the administrative cost 
of carrying out the transfers. Redistribution of the benefits of engineering projects 
rarely occurs in practice.  
 
It is therefore important that the distributional consequences of any major 
project be explicitly considered. Of particular relevance is the effect of the project 
on the income levels of certain target groups. These target groups may be 
distinguished on the basis of income (e.g. those living below the poverty level), 
race, sex, or geographic region.  

Sustainability, Environmental and Social Considerations 
275 
 
 
It has been suggested by Weisbrod (1972) that the distributional question can 
be approached by placing explicit weights on the benefits and costs received by 
each group in the community. Traditional benefit-cost analysis gives the same 
weight to a dollar of benefits received by a pauper and by a millionaire. It is 
conceptually possible to give a higher weight to benefits or costs incurred by low-
income earners and thus develop a single index of social welfare, using the 
following formula:

m
i
i

i
SW
w B

(9.2) 
 
where SW is the index of social welfare; Bi is the present value of benefits received 
by group i; Ci is the present value of costs incurred by group i; wi is the âsocialâ 
weight of benefits or costs to group i; and m is total number of community groups. 
The difficulties of deciding on a set of weights and implementing this approach 
should be apparent.  
Population Distribution 
It has been argued that the redistribution of population throughout a region or the 
nation may be a major objective of government policy. This is particularly true in 
sparsely populated nations such as Australia. Major engineering projects in remote 
areas may contribute positively to the decentralization of population. The benefits 
of decentralization are related to enhanced national security and the benefits of rural 
versus urban living. High concentrations of population and industry are particularly 
vulnerable to attack by conventional or nuclear weapons. On the other hand, the 
settlement of remote areas leads to additional infrastructure costs for electricity 
supply, roads, railways, water supply, ports, and airfields.  
 
Projects such as major irrigation developments which contribute to maintaining 
the size of the rural community may be supported on the grounds of the âhealthierâ 
lifestyle of country living. Continued growth of large cities at the expense of the 
surrounding country areas may also involve considerable increases in infrastructure 
costs in the city, as well as increases in the crime rate and other social problems. The 
negative aspects of population redistribution on individual families also need to be 
considered. These include the weakening of friendships and family ties and the stress 
associated with moving, setting up a new home, and adjusting to a changed lifestyle. 
The benefits of urbanization versus decentralization can vary from family to family 
depending on the independence of the family members. 
Employment  
One of the benefits cited by governments when new public works are announced is 
the effect that it will have on unemployment. A large engineering project may 
involve considerable employment in the implementation phase and also in the 
operations phase. Some people consider this an achievement in itself. In an 
economy with little or no unemployment, workers employed on a specific project 
will be taken from productive activities elsewhere in the economy. Therefore, the 
opportunity cost of their labour will be assessed as a cost to the project in the 
economic evaluation. In such a case, the number of people employed on the project 
is not a social benefit.  

276 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
 
In an economy with high unemployment, some of the workers employed on 
the project may have been previously unemployed. As discussed in Section 8.8, 
previously unemployed labour has an opportunity cost to the project considerably 
less than the wage rate. If this effect is correctly taken into account in the economic 
evaluation of all projects, there is no need to further describe the employment 
implications of the projects, as this would be a double-counting of the same benefit.  
 
The foregoing applies to public sector projects only. In the economic 
evaluation of private sector developments, all labour is costed at the actual wage 
rate paid. Thus, at times when there is less than full employment in the economy, 
the true net benefits of the project to society will be understated. In such cases it is 
valid to include the additional employment opportunities created by the project as 
part of the social evaluation.  
 
The distributional consequences of employment opportunities may also be 
important; for example, in the creation of employment opportunities in depressed 
regions of the country or among disadvantaged groups such as ethnic, or low-
income groups.  
Life, Health, and Safety 
Many engineering works contribute to saving lives, improving health, or increasing 
safety in the community. Typical examples are flood mitigation works, water 
treatment plants, sewage treatment, improved road alignments, grade separation, 
and coastal protection works. Attempts have been made to include the benefits of 
lives saved into the economic evaluation of public sector projects by placing an 
economic value on human life. Various methods have been suggested for estimating 
the economic benefits of saving human life. These include:  
 
ï· 
the present value of the person's expected future earnings; 
ï· 
a value imputed from political decisions which involve public expenditure 
aimed at reducing the number of deaths. For example, the government spends 
$50 m in equivalent annual worth to upgrade railway crossings which will save 
an estimated 100 lives per year from fatal accidents. The implied value of saving 
one life is greater than or equal to $50 m/100 (i.e. $0.5 m per live saved); and  
ï· 
a dollar amount which people are prepared to accept as compensation in order to 
put up with the additional risk of death involved in the project. For example, a 
proposed new chemical plant will increase the probability of death per year to 
each person in an adjoining town by 1 in 10,000. The economic cost of this 
increased risk is the sum over all people in the town of the minimum level of 
compensation which each person is prepared to accept in order to tolerate the 
increased risk. The same basis can be used for projects which reduce the 
probability of death for part of the community.  
 
 
Practical and theoretical difficulties exist with all of these economic 
approaches. An alternative approach is to estimate the number of lives saved per 
year and treat this as a social benefit. Similar arguments apply to projects which 
increase or reduce the risk to public health or the chance of accidents occurring. 
Either a dollar value may be used in the economic evaluation or an estimated 
reduction in the risk may be included in the social evaluation.  

Sustainability, Environmental and Social Considerations 
277 
 
Educational, Cultural, and Recreational Opportunities  
It has already been stated that the distribution of income, and in particular to certain 
disadvantaged groups, is an important social effect. Similarly the distribution of 
educational, cultural, and recreational opportunities among regions and socio-
economic groups may be an important consideration in evaluating a major project. 
For example, a major dam may provide a new recreational resource for fishing, 
boating, picnicking, and swimming (depending on the final end use of the water). 
The social benefits of these recreational uses may be as important as the economic 
benefits of the water provided by the dam. In some cases it may be advantageous to 
choose a dam site close to a population centre in order to increase the recreational 
opportunities for a particular group of people.  
 
Educational and cultural values may be enhanced by engineering projects 
providing improved access to sites of historical, archaeological, or scientific 
interest. For example, a new road along the coast may provide improved access to 
some unique geological formations which are of considerable interest to the public, 
but controls need to be enforced; otherwise, the project could lead to the ruin of the 
formation. 
National Security and Emergency Preparedness 
A new road or railway could have important consequences for national security. 
Such benefits are difficult to quantify in economic terms and, in fact, only become 
apparent in times of armed conflict. However, they may be an important social 
consideration in the evaluation of a project.  
 
Emergency preparedness requires, for example, the provision of a flexible 
water supply, electricity grid, and road and rail network. The provision of a single 
dam to supply water to a city or a single power station to supply electricity may be 
economically efficient under normal circumstances but could be disastrous in the 
event of a catastrophe such as major technical failure, earthquake, hurricane, 
nuclear explosion, or act of sabotage. The provision of some redundancy in all 
engineering systems is a good rule to follow.  
Displacement and Relocation 
Engineering projects in urban areas may involve the displacement and relocation of 
some houses, and commercial or industrial buildings. A typical example arises from 
the land acquisition associated with an improved transport link, such as a freeway, 
arterial road, tramway, or railway. It is common practice for the households or firms 
displaced to be suitably compensated for the loss of their land, home, shop, or 
factory.  
 
It is often argued that the loss of physical assets is suitably compensated for by 
the payment of fair market value. However, such an argument ignores the 
fundamental distinction between value in exchange and value in use. Consider the 
market for houses of a particular age and quality. If the current market price for such 
houses is Po, this may be called the âvalue in exchange of the propertyâ. Clearly all 
homeowners who are prepared to sell at this price or less will put their houses on the 
market. However, there are many homeowners who are not willing to sell at the 
price Po. To these people, the value in use of the house exceeds its value in 

278 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
exchange. If a road authority were to compulsorily acquire such a house and pay 
compensation equal to Po, the homeowner would clearly suffer a loss of utility. Full 
compensation should cover the value in use of the asset and would usually exceed Po 
by a significant margin. A similar argument applies to commercial and industrial 
properties.  
 
The difference between value in use and value in exchange of a house 
includes an allowance for the stress of moving, disruption of social ties, the cost of 
finding a new house, and changes in accessibility and travel costs at the new 
location. In practice such costs are difficult to assess and considerable negotiation 
may be required with the property owners.  
 
The compensation costs for displaced households and firms are a true 
opportunity cost to a project and should be included in the economic evaluation, 
rather than the social evaluation.  
Neighbourhood Disruption and Intrusion 
An engineering project may involve significant disruption and/or intrusion into a 
community. This is particularly true of transportation corridors which can sever a 
cohesive community or produce intrusive impacts in the form of noise, vibration, 
air pollution, or aesthetic degradation. A sense of community is often very strong 
and may be centred on facilities such as schools, shopping centres, the town hall, or 
parks. Proposals which isolate one part of the community from another may receive 
considerable opposition from local community groups. Transport corridors should 
be planned to provide the minimum disruption to communities and ensure that 
adequate safe crossings such as overpasses or underpasses are provided for 
pedestrians and cyclists.  
 
The principle of compensation described in the previous section can be 
applied to neighbourhood disruption and intrusion, but it is very difficult to define 
the loss of utility for an entire community. Attempts have been made to assess the 
economic effects of noise due to airports, highways, or railways by assessing the 
lower property values adjacent to these facilities. If such an approach is taken, these 
social effects can be included as a cost in the economic evaluation.  
9.7 SOCIAL ASSESSMENT TOOLS AND METHODS 
An extremely important facet of undertaking any project analysis involves the 
participation of interested stakeholders. This is an area where many engineers will 
be called on to manage and participate with specialists who work in the social 
assessment area. A basic knowledge of the methods available for undertaking such 
project analyses is given in the UNEP EIA Training Manual (UNEP, 2002). A 
number of methods are described below which allow social concerns to be 
discovered and to determine local knowledge concerning a proposed project. 
Analytical tools 
Stakeholder analysis is an entry point to Social Impact Assessment (SIA) and 
participatory work. It addresses strategic questions, e.g. Who are the key 
stakeholders? What are their interests in the project or policy? What are the power 
differentials between them? What relative influence do they have on the operation? 

Sustainability, Environmental and Social Considerations 
279 
 
This information helps to identify institutions and relationships which, if ignored, 
can have negative influence on proposals or, if considered, can be built upon to 
strengthen them. 
 
Gender analysis focuses on understanding and documenting the differences in 
gender roles, activities, needs and opportunities in a given context. It highlights the 
different roles and behaviour of men and women. These attributes vary across 
cultures, class, ethnicity, income, education, and time; and so gender analysis does 
not treat men or women as a homogeneous group. 
 
Data Review of information from previous work is an inexpensive, easy way 
to narrow the focus of a social assessment, to identify experts and institutions that 
are familiar with the development and context, and to establish a relevant 
framework and key social variables in advance for the project. 
Community-based methods 
The participatory approach aims to ascertain local knowledge and actions. It uses 
group exercises to enable stakeholders to share information and to develop plans. 
These techniques have been employed successfully in a variety of settings to enable 
local people to work together to plan community-appropriate developments. 
Attributes of self-esteem, associative strength, resourcefulness, action planning and 
responsibility for follow-through are important to achieve a participatory approach 
to development. Generally there is a philosophy of empowerment of the 
stakeholders to enable people to adopt responsibility for outcomes. It can best be 
described as development of teambuilding skills and learning from local experience 
rather than from external experts. Other participatory consultation methods include 
selecting a sample of stakeholders to ensure that their concerns are incorporated 
into the assessment. This selection is for the purposes of giving voice to the poor 
and other disadvantaged stakeholders. 
Other Participatory Methods 
Role playing helps people to be creative, open their perspectives, understand the 
choices that another person might face, and make choices free from their usual 
responsibilities. This exercise can stimulate discussion, improve communication, 
and promote collaboration at both community and agency levels. 
 
Wealth ranking (also known as âwell-being rankingâ or âvulnerability 
analysisâ) is a visual technique to engage local people in the rapid data collection 
and analysis of social stratification in a community (regardless of language and 
literacy barriers). It focuses on the factors which constitute wealth, such as 
ownership of or right to use productive assets/resources, their relationship to locally 
powerful people, labour and indebtedness. 
 
Mapping is an inexpensive tool for gathering both descriptive and diagnostic 
information. Mapping exercises are useful for collecting baseline data on a number 
of indicators as part of a beneficiary assessment or rapid appraisal, and can lay the 
foundation for community ownership of development planning by including 
different groups and making them aware of the implications of the project.  
 
Needs Assessment draws out information about people's needs and 
requirements in their daily lives. It raises participants' awareness of development 
issues and provides a framework for prioritising actions and interventions. All 

280 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
sectors can benefit from participating in a needs assessment, as can trainers, project 
staff and field workers. 
 
Tree Diagrams are multi-purpose, visual tools for narrowing and prioritising 
problems, objectives or decisions. Information is organized into a tree-like diagram. 
The main issue is represented by the trunk, and the relevant factors, influences and 
outcomes are shown as roots and branches of the tree. Other techniques such as 
mind mapping, as discussed in Chapter 6, can also be used for this purpose. 
Observation and interview tools 
Focus group meetings are a rapid way to collect comparative data from a variety of 
stakeholders. They are brief meetings - usually one to two hours - with many 
potential uses, e.g. to address a particular concern; to build community consensus 
about implementation plans; to cross-check information with a large number of 
people; or to obtain reactions to hypothetical or intended actions. 
 
Workshop-based methods encourage participatory planning and analysis 
throughout the project life cycle. A series of stakeholder workshops tend to be held 
to set priorities, and integrate them into planning, implementation and monitoring. 
Building commitment and capacity is an integral part of this process (UNEP, 2002). 
These stakeholder workshops are in common use for many infrastructure and 
resource projects throughout the world. 
 
9.8 SUMMARY   
Engineers have a primary responsibility to society when developing infrastructure 
and this can override their responsibility to the client, depending on the Code of 
Ethics being applied. The responsibility entails evaluating environmental and social 
effects of the project. Many consulting engineering firms are required to perform 
Environmental Impact Assessments for projects that they plan and design. In many 
cases, the engineer will be actively involved in stakeholder consultations, giving 
presentations to community groups as well as professional groups. To do this, 
communication skills and knowledge of the environmental assessment process are 
essential. Future work for both private development and for government 
infrastructure will be undertaken using sustainability principles to guide the 
development of the project. The role of the engineer in planning is to identify the 
most efficient designs, in terms of all the objectives, and recognize the trade-offs 
among them. 
 
Professional engineering institutions worldwide have embedded sustainability 
within their charters and codes of ethics, but progress to achieve these ideals has in 
the past been thwarted by little political and legislative assistance, but this is 
changing. The production of CO2 and the linkage to climate change are the main 
driving forces for the way industry and government are viewing sustainability. The 
integration of sustainable energy systems with a process of closed-loop systems for 
resource use is seen as a key element in approaching sustainability.

CHAPTER TEN  
Ethics and Law 
 
As engineering work is concerned with creating and improving the physical 
infrastructure, it is inevitable that engineering decisions often involve value 
judgements that raise questions concerning ethics, integrity and the law. In this 
chapter we discuss how ethics and legal obligations influence decisions that 
engineers make. The difference between the civil laws of tort and contract law is 
explained. In order to make responsible decisions, professional engineers must 
consider their obligations to society, employers, and to fellow employees. They also 
must take account of the many laws and regulations that apply to engineering work. 
In some circumstances the different obligations and laws and regulations can be 
mutually incompatible. Sometimes, litigation becomes the last resort to solving 
problems involving ethics and the law. 
10.1 ETHICS IN ENGINEERING 
Many professions, including the medical, the engineering and the legal professions, 
have developed codes of ethics to guide the behaviour of practitioners. Some of 
these codes are entrenched in law, so that violations of the code are subject either to 
civil or criminal penalty, while other codes involve an organisational penalty such 
as loss of licence or membership. Other codes are advisory or subject to 
enforcement by the promulgating institution.  
 
Throughout the world there are many different codes of ethics that set standards 
for professional engineers. The Centre for the Study of Ethics in the Professions 
lists more than 75 organisations or institutions with codes of ethics that are 
applicable to the engineering profession (The Illinois Institute of Technology, 
2016). Interest boxes in this chapter list the key elements in ethical codes that are 
used by the engineering profession in Australia (Engineers Australia, 2010), the 
United Kingdom (Engineering Council UK, 2014), and the United States (NSPE, 
2007). 
 
In Australia, Engineers Australiaâs Code of Ethics (2010) is largely derived from 
the World Federation of Engineering Organisations (WFEO) Model Code of Ethics. 
It states that engineers have obligations to society, to employers and clients, and to 
other engineers. Engineers are expected to adopt the standards spelt out in the code, 
to regulate their work habits and relationships, as well as the legal and moral 
standard that a professional engineer should adhere to.  
 
In the United Kingdom, Chartered Engineers and Incorporated Engineers are 
expected to observe the Code of Conduct of the engineering institution that they 
join. Each UK Institution (Civil, Mechanical, Chemical, Structural, etc.) follows the 
Engineering Council guidelines for the Code of Conduct which stresses that 

290 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
engineers should act with integrity regarding all issues associated with the 
profession, from dealing with the public, their fellow workers, the environment and 
all business operations. 
 
 
Code of Ethics 
(Engineers Australia, 2010) 
 
The Engineers Australia Code of Ethics is designed to define the values and 
principles that shape decisions made by engineers. The code is complemented 
by Guidelines on Professional Conduct. Members of Engineers Australia can be 
held accountable to the code through Engineers Australiaâs disciplinary 
regulations. The code states: 
 
In the course of engineering practice we will: 
 
1. Demonstrate integrity 
  1.1 Act on the basis of a well-informed conscience 
  1.2 Be honest and trustworthy 
  1.3 Respect the dignity of all persons 
 
2. Practise competently 
  2.1 Maintain and develop knowledge and skills 
  2.2 Represent areas of competence objectively 
  2.3 Act on the basis of adequate knowledge 
 
3. Exercise leadership 
  3.1 Uphold the reputation and trustworthiness of the practice of engineering 
  3.2 Support and encourage diversity 
  3.3 Communicate honestly and effectively, taking into account the reliance of 
         others on engineering expertise 
 
4. Promote sustainability 
  4.1 Engage responsibly with the community and other stakeholders 
  4.2 Practise engineering to foster the health, safety and wellbeing of the 
        community and the environment 
  4.3 Balance the needs of the present with the needs of future generations 
 
https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/ethics 
 
 
 
In the United States, the Code of Ethics of the National Society of Professional 
Engineers is stated in terms of Fundamental Cannons, Rules of Practice and 
Professional Obligations.  
 
In other countries, national interests can also be seen within the specific codes. 
The Japan Society of Civil Engineers Code of Professional Conduct (2014) has a 
requirement to ensure the security of society and to mitigate disasters. While many 
of the national codes have some similar content, their variation demonstrates the 
need for a professional engineer to appreciate the expected conduct within the given 
operating environment and culture.  
 

Ethics and Law 
291 
 
10.2 ETHICS AND MORAL PHILOSOPHY 
Ethics deals with the interpretation of moral values, laws and principles which sway 
the decisions and behaviour of individuals and groups. It is part of the field of moral 
philosophy, which attempts to distinguish between that which is right and that 
which is wrong. A brief overview of moral philosophy provides a useful basis for 
the discussion of the ethical questions that arise in engineering.  
 
 
Questions of morality include (Newall, 2005): 
 
ï· 
What is right and what is wrong?  
ï· 
What are rights? Who or what has them?  
ï· 
Is there an ethical system that applies to everyone?  
ï· 
What are the differences between community interests and self-interest? 
ï· 
What do we mean by honour, integrity and dignity?  
 
Statement of Ethical Principles  
(Engineering Council, United Kingdom, 2014) 
  
The Engineering Council, together with the Royal Academy of Engineering, in 
the United Kingdom provides the following four fundamental principles, to 
supplement codes of conduct by individual engineering institutions. 
 
Accuracy and rigour - Professional engineers and technicians have a duty to 
ensure that they acquire and use wisely and faithfully the knowledge that is 
relevant to the engineering skills needed in their work in the service of others. 
 
Honesty and integrity - Professional engineers and technicians should adopt 
the highest standards of professional conduct, openness, fairness and 
honesty. 
 
Respect for life, law and the public good - Professional engineers and 
technicians should give due weight to all relevant law, facts and published 
guidance, and the wider public interest. 
 
Responsible leadership: listening and informing - Professional engineers 
and technicians should aspire to high standards of leadership in the 
exploitation and management of technology. They hold a privileged and 
trusted position in society, and are expected to demonstrate that they are 
seeking to serve the wider society and to be sensitive to public concerns. 
 
 
Issues of moral reasoning are investigated in the field of moral philosophy, as 
well as the meaning of the terms used in moral discourse. Moral philosophy deals 
with both analytic ethics (or metaethics) and normative ethics. In the field of 
analytic ethics, the questions that are discussed include whether moral judgements 
are possible, whether moral values exist objectively or only subjectively, and 
whether they are linked to cultures or individuals. Normative ethics deal with the 
ethics of specific actions. In so far as we are concerned here with ethics in 
engineering: âThe purpose of analytic and normative ethics is to enable us to arrive 
at a critical, reflective morality of our own choosingâ (Taylor, 1972). 
 

292 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
 
An awareness of alternatives is essential when deliberating any decision, as this 
is what enables us to express a freedom of choice. The principle of freedom is 
essential to a theory of ethics. People cannot be responsible for their actions if there 
is no freedom of choice. Any action will determine a consequence which partly 
results from the set of laws and partly from the principles governing the decision.  
 
  
 
Code of Ethics for Engineers 
(United States National Society of Professional Engineers, 2007) 
 
The National Society of Professional Engineers in the United States requires 
members of the profession to exhibit the highest standards of honesty and 
integrity. The Code of Ethics includes fundamental canons, rules of practice and 
professional obligations. 
 
Fundamental Canons 
Engineers, in the fulfillment of their professional duties, shall 
 
ï· Hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public. 
ï· Perform services only in areas of their competence. 
ï· Issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner. 
ï· Act for each employer or client as faithful agents or trustees. 
ï· Avoid deceptive acts. 
ï· Conduct themselves honorably, responsibly, ethically, and lawfully so as to 
enhance the honor, reputation, and usefulness of the profession. 
 
 
 
There is a relativity in ethics which explains that conduct called good or bad and 
acceptable or unacceptable now has varied across time and among societies. 
Therefore, some people call things "right" that many others have a problem with. 
The Dalai Lama stated in a radio interview, "Of course, there are different truths on 
different levels. Things are true relative to other things; "long" and "short" relate to 
each other, "high" and "low," and so on. But is there any absolute truth? Something 
self-sufficient, independently true in itself? I don't think so." (Thurman, 1997). 
 
Much of the moral reasoning of ethics in western countries in the past has been 
influenced by the Greek philosophers and, in particular, Socrates, Plato and 
Aristotle. Other major ethicists and philosophers through the ages have included 
instigators of various religions: Buddha (B.C. 483-563) the Indian philosopher and 
spiritual leader spreading Buddhism through Asia; Lao-zi, or Lao Tze, the founder 
of Taoism and the supposed author of Tao Te Ching; Confucius (Kong Fu-zi), 
whose philosophy and religion came to dominate China for more than two 
millennia; the Hebrew Bible with Judaism; Christianity based on the teachings of 
Jesus; and Mohammed with the Koran and Islam.  
 
A myriad of writings is available to provide a basis for the study of ethics. A 
person thinks through a problem and then makes ethical decisions could be 
considered an individualist, even when the reasoning leads to societyâs norms. This 
is because the person has reasoned the decision and not just acted an existing value 
system. 
 

Ethics and Law 
293 
 
 
Ullmann (1983) condemns people, including some engineers, who act as the 
implementers of othersâ goals without questioning them, when these goals might be 
to design weapon systems of mass destruction, or gas chambers and crematoria of 
concentration camps. The supporting argument from the condemned parties could 
be âthat I was only obeying orders or doing my jobâ. It is necessary as an engineer 
to collect information for any decision and weigh up the consequences of the 
outcomes resulting from that decision. 
 
 
Socrates (470â399 BC) 
 
Socrates was a philosopher who took his own life by drinking hemlock after 
being found guilty by an Athenian people's court of interfering with the religion of 
the city. Socrates âwas accused of corrupting the youthâ because he taught his 
students to question thinking. In his method, questions were posed to assist a 
person or group to examine their beliefs and their knowledge. The Socratic 
method uses hypothesis elimination, by eliminating those hypotheses that lead to 
contradictions and hence leaving the better hypotheses. This method forced 
people to examine their own beliefs as well as those of authorities. Socrates 
seemed to believe that wrongdoing resulted from ignorance, in that those who 
did wrong knew no better. 
 
He did not recant and was sentenced to death. He could have escaped 
through the help of his friends but refused. In fact, Socrates said, "The life 
untested by criticism is not worth living." 
 
 
Ullmann (1986) 
 
10.3 ETHICS AND WHISTLE BLOWING 
Historically, codes of ethics have sometimes been used to stifle dissent within a 
profession (Johnston et al, 1995). This is because codes of ethical behaviour, in 
general, emphasize refraining from criticizing fellow professionals and maintaining 
the professionâs reputation. Situations where major disasters have occurred have led 
to the perception that there have been a lot more âwhistle blowersâ in recent years in 
engineering. Perhaps as technology has become more complex and environmental 
concerns have increased, there is a greater concern about ethics in decision making. 
To examine a problem from many angles is a useful way to develop an ethical 
approach, as the choice to take a certain action will only exist if we are aware of 
alternatives.  
 
When does the dilemma of obligation to society override the obligation to the 
company or to peers? In some engineering situations, a conflict of obligations can 
arise. How does one address the obligations that a professional engineer has? Is 
there a natural hierarchy of obligations? Generally, it is acknowledged that an 
obligation to society takes precedence over obligation to the employer. What are the 
responsibilities, of both a personal and professional nature, which complicate ethical 
decisions? The term âblowing-the-whistleâ refers to disclosing information outside 
of standard reporting lines, when a wrong has been identified and it is not felt that 
standard reporting will be sufficient to address the concern. Information is often 
disclosed to prevent or stop continuation of certain activities. When it comes to 

294 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
"blowing-the-whistle", there are numerous concerns, not the least being career 
prospects and family life.  
 
The story of the Russian mining engineer, Peter Palchinsky, may serve as an 
inspiration for engineers today to follow moral principles, perhaps with less drastic 
consequences. Graham (1996) in his book, The Ghost of the Executed Engineer â 
Technology and the Fall of the Russian Empire, relates how Peter Palchinsky 
(1875â1929) spoke up against the misuse of resources. The misuse of technology 
and squandering of human resources by the Russian government incensed 
Palchinsky and he attempted to make known the facts of the misuse. He was 
imprisoned, but was released shortly thereafter by the efforts of his wife and friends. 
Palchinsky continued his professional engineering career and went on to criticize 
several of Stalin's projects: the White Sea Canal; Dnieper River Dam; and the Steel 
City of Magnitogorsk. His days were numbered, and he was executed in May 1929.  
 
It was shown by Graham that there are different consequences of voicing what 
the individual believes to be morally correct ideas or demonstrating an obligation to 
society, from those of politically correct ideas depending on the political 
environment at the time. The book also shows the dangers of major projects which 
ignore human values. 
 
The whistle blowing exploits of engineer Roger Boisjoly, concerning the 
Challenger disaster of January 1986, are still important for study on ethical decision 
making. The details about how the launch went forward in unusually cold 
temperatures against the recommendation of engineers are well known. Examining 
the events in ethical terms leads us to a better understanding of âwhistle blowingâ. 
The term portrays the sharp sound of a whistle, warning of harm or trying to halt 
actions which are about to go outside of acceptable bounds. Roger Boisjoly's action 
did not fit that scenario. What branded him as a whistleblower was his decision to 
relate to a presidential commission after the disaster the story of events that led to 
the disaster. The tragedy he had warned about had already occurred. He told the 
commission the history of the O-ring problems, and the decision to launch, even 
though he was being pressured by managers of his own company not to do so. 
Boisjoly's account was forward looking in view of the design of newer shuttles. It 
was really the high visibility of Boisjoly's disclosure about the failure that labelled 
his report as âwhistle blowingâ. 
 
When a discloser deliberately steps outside of approved organizational channels 
to reveal a significant problem, this could be termed âwhistle blowingâ. In this case, 
the warning against launching in the meeting before the disastrous launch was 
acting within approved channels. Can it be said that all those decision makers above 
Boisjoly acted ethically? His testimony to the presidential commission did not 
contravene the approved channels, but rather, his testimony was honest and 
demonstrated the obligation he had to society. 
 
Non-ethical behaviour seems to be driven by the advance of industry and the 
desire for success, power and money. Over time the need to choose between right 
and wrong, survival of a family or company, use of the environment now or 
preserving it for future generations is becoming more important for the individual in 
daily life. Ethical decisions reflect the conscious decision to do what is the right 
thing.  
 
Generally, people use ethics to impose constraints on oneâs own behaviour, 
whereas law could be described as a system of externally imposed or legislated 

Ethics and Law 
295 
 
constraints on the behaviour of the individual and society. The question of âwhat to 
do?â arises when there is conflict between ethics and law. 
10.4 THE LEGAL SYSTEM 
Roman law was developed in the City of Rome and in the Roman Empire as it 
expanded across Europe and beyond. In the Middle Ages, following the demise of 
Roman rule over Europe, Roman law was largely discarded. However, it continued 
to influence legal thinking and legal practice and through the ages has been revived, 
transformed and reinvented many times. For the first two centuries of the Common 
Era, Roman legal science was very fertile. This age is considered to be the classical 
period of Roman Law, as the law which was taught and practised best exemplified 
the Roman legal tradition (Rufner, 2006). From the 10th Century on, there was a 
renewed interest Roman Law. It was studied and taught at universities in Europe 
and this led to it being applied in the area of civil law throughout most of Europe, 
except in England. However, the Roman-based law in Europe from the 16th 
Century was very different from the Roman law of antiquity and it was called Ius 
Commune (common law). The modern European legal systems are derived from the 
Ius Commune as it was interpreted and rewritten by medieval jurists.  
 
National legal codes, developed in the 18th and 19th Centuries, superseded the 
Ius Commune. The most important of these was the Code of Napoleon in 1804 in 
France, which became the basis for the rule of law in Belgium, the Netherlands, 
Portugal, Spain, and their former colonies. However, in Germany, Roman law was 
maintained in most of the regions until 1900 when the German Civil Code was 
introduced. The Roman-Dutch law based on Ius Commune still remains the basis of 
the legal system in the Republic of South Africa. The influence on the English legal 
system from the teaching of Roman law at Oxford and Cambridge amounted to 
ways of reasoning and concepts developed by continental legal scientists.  
 
The English legal system has been followed in Australia, New Zealand and 
other former member countries of the former British Empire, as well as, to a large 
part, in the United States. It is a âcommon lawâ system which is based on the results 
of legal cases over a long period of time, whereas the codified civil law system on 
the European continent, as described above, emanated from Roman law. The term 
âcommon lawâ loosely describes the whole of the English legal system and has 
been used to distinguish between common law rules and equity, although the term 
in its broadest sense now embraces equitable principles. 
 
There are two major sources for law, one being case law from judgements and 
the other from legislation through parliament. Both new and amended legislation 
and case law result in the law continually changing. In the building industry, 
engineers must be familiar with acts, codes of practice, ordinances and regulations 
which control the various facets of planning, design and construction of urban 
infrastructure. There are also some statutory modifications to common law, such as 
establishing the requirement of written contracts for sale of real estate. 
 
Acts that will impinge upon an engineerâs work are numerous and relate to all 
facets of the planning and development of infrastructure in a city and environs. For 
different countries and states these tend to be diverse and are continually changing 
under different governments. 

296 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
 
In Australia, there are both Federal laws (covering everyone in the country) and 
State laws (covering people in the State or Territory which passes the law). A State 
or Territory Parliament can pass a law in an area where there is no Federal law, or it 
can pass a law that adopts what is said in a Federal law. If there is a clash between a 
Federal law and a State or Territory law, the Federal law overrides the State law. 
The Constitution of Australia outlines the laws the Federal Government can pass. 
Similarly, in the United States the Constitution defines the nature of laws which can 
be introduced within jurisdictions, whether at a federal or state level. Hence 
engineers will find themselves working under both Federal and State laws. 
 
Most engineering and building works are subject to one or more of a range of 
Government Acts and Regulations, at both the State and Federal level. These may 
affect areas of planning development, design, construction, materials used, 
employment, environmental impacts, occupational health and safety, water supply 
and sewerage, water resources, natural resources, public health, energy and 
transport. 
 
Different states have different Acts in Australia but some codes such as The 
Building Code of Australia (BCA), which is a set of technical provisions for the 
design and construction of buildings and other structures, are common to all states. 
The BCA is produced and maintained by the Australian Building Codes Board 
(ABCB) on behalf of the Australian Government and each State and Territory 
Government. Similar codes and Boards (or Councils) can be found throughout the 
world, including the International Code Council and the Canadian Code Centre. 
 
Criminal law is the body of law which deals with crime and the legal 
punishment of criminal offences. It is that part of law that deals with matters of 
public interest. For example, the public has an interest in seeing that people are 
protected from being robbed or assaulted. Before the 18th and 19th Centuries, legal 
systems did not clearly define criminal and civil law. Codification of criminal laws 
progressed and separation of civil and criminal law occurred. Criminal law 
distinguishes crimes from civil wrongs such as tort or breach of contract, where 
there is a dispute between private individuals or organisations. The origin of tort 
comes from the French for âwrongâ and is a civil wrong, other than a breach of 
contract. In engineering work, civil law is of prime interest, although criminal law 
can be relevant in the case of negligence. The following sections discuss aspects of 
the legal system most relevant to engineers.  
10.5 LAW OF CONTRACT 
The Law of Contract is of particular relevance as engineers provide services to 
customers, and procure services from others. Each of these transactions made 
externally to an organisation is likely to involve a contract. 
 
A contract is an "agreement" or a "promise" that is recognized by the law. âThe 
common law assumes that a contract is an agreement between parties of equal 
bargaining powerâ (Cooke, 2001). A contract may be simply defined as a voluntary 
agreement where one party agrees to do work for another for a stated payment, 
which the law can enforce. For a contract to be legally enforceable it must include 
the following elements: 
 

Ethics and Law 
297 
 
ï· 
An offer must be made by one party to the other; 
ï· 
Acceptance of the offer must be made by the second party; 
ï· 
There must be consideration, such as a promise of payment; and 
ï· 
There must be a mutual intention to create a legal relationship. 
 
 
It is important to note that a contract will only be valid if the work to be done is 
legal and if both parties are legally competent. Therefore, no contracts for terrorism 
or illegal drug deals will hold up in a court of law.  
 
Any contract that uses words, spoken or written, is labelled a verbal contract. An 
informal exchange of spoken promises can be binding and regarded as legally valid 
as a written contract, but will generally lead to more disputation if large sums of 
money are involved. A spoken contract is often called an "oral contract".  
 
Courts in the United States have generally ruled that if the parties have the same 
intent and they act as though there were a formal, written and signed contract, then a 
contract exists. However, most jurisdictions require a signed written form for 
certain kinds of contracts such as real estate transactions and some building 
legislation (e.g. Home Building Act, NSW). 
 
In Australia, there is no requirement for the entire contract to be in writing, 
although there must be evidence in the form of a note or memorandum of the 
contract, which must be signed. In England and Wales there is a âStatute of Fraudsâ 
legislation for guarantees which must be evidenced in writing, although the 
agreement may be made orally. Other kinds of contract (such as for the sale of land) 
must be in writing, otherwise they are void. If a binding agreement or an oral 
exchange is not honoured by one or more of the parties involved in the contract, by 
non-performance or interference with the other party's performance, then a âbreach 
of contractâ is deemed to have been committed. 
 
Engineering contracts should be in writing to avoid ambiguities, and to simplify 
enforcement, if it is necessary. In the engineering and construction industries, the 
word tender is used when describing an offer by one of the parties. A contract for an 
engineering project may include drawings and specifications, which will include 
details of the full works required by the client/owner from the contractor. Contracts 
need to be specific to the agreement under consideration. Contracts do not need to 
be constructed by a lawyer, although the more complex the contract the more likely 
a lawyer will be involved. Engineering companies may have standard terms and 
conditions prepared by a lawyer and then these are used for all contracts that fall 
within pre-determined conditions. Alternatively, standard contracts conditions 
developed for common project types may be agreeable to both parties. Examples of 
such contracts include those based on the Australian Standard AS 2124:1992 
General conditions of contract and AS4300:1995 General conditions of contract for 
design and construct. 
Contract termination 
A contract between parties is said to be discharged when the agreement is 
terminated. This can occur in several ways and usually for different reasons. 
Contracts can be terminated by agreement, when contract reaches completion, or 
because of a breach of contract, as described below:  
 

298 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
ï· 
Agreement: The parties terminate the contract on mutual agreement by either 
party waiving their rights and/or releasing the other party from any obligations. 
ï· 
Completion: The contract is discharged completely when it has been 
completely fulfilled in every respect by both parties. 
ï· 
Breach: Whenever a party fails an obligation which was included in the 
contract, then a breach of contract has been committed.  
 
 
When a breach occurs, action will of course be taken to determine the cause of 
the breach and/or how the contract can recover from it. Breaches can arise where a 
contract becomes seriously behind schedule. For a construction project, this is likely 
to follow many site meetings from the contract administrator to improve 
performance. It will also occur usually after on-site work has slowed down, or event 
stopped. In such cases, a possible cause will be that the contractor has financial 
problems. Clauses in the contract may allow the owner/client to terminate the 
contract. Also, the contractor may determine that the owner has not provided certain 
certificates or has refused to supply sufficient instructions on the work. In either 
case, if the contract is terminated without good cause, either party will be able to 
make a claim for damages for wrongful repudiation of the contract. In this kind of 
case there are bound to be lengthy delays and cost escalations on the contract, as 
well as large legal fees. 
 
 Within the contract process, a notice of intention to terminate by either party 
needs to be made under the procedures of the contract (Cooke, 2001). 
Considerations include: 
 
ï· 
lapse of time: actions on a contract must be commenced within a certain time 
period decided by law; and 
ï· 
impossibility of performance: this may arise when the contract works change so 
markedly from what was originally envisaged that a party can be exonerated 
from their obligations. 
 
 
Most engineering contracts are terminated by completion or agreement. 
However, if termination occurs by breach of the contractor, then contract clauses 
usually permit the owner to retain all equipment and materials on site, completing 
the work at the contractorâs expense. If the owner were in breach, then the 
contractor can take out an action against the owner. Failure to complete the contract 
within a specified time exposes the contractor to a claim of liquidated damages 
which could be included as a provision in the contract as a specific sum per day. 
Liquidated damages can be construed as a debt owed by the contactor to the owner 
and can be deducted from contract payments. Obviously, the owner cannot delay the 
works and then recover damages. All obligations on both parties must therefore be 
strictly observed if their rights under the contact are to be preserved. Contracts can 
run late due to (a) the lack of supply of certain materials, (b) long periods of rainfall 
not allowing the contractor to undertake work on site, and (c) disputes between 
subcontractors and the main contractor.  
 
The engineer will, in many cases, be in the position of an arbitrator to settle 
minor variations on the original contract. If there cannot be an amicable solution 
between the contractor and the administrator (acting for the client), then all the 
parties could become involved in a dispute that leads to litigation. It is therefore 

Ethics and Law 
299 
 
essential for the engineer, or the administrator of the contract, to keep detailed and 
accurate records of all contract variations and actions by the contractor.  
10.6 LAW OF TORT 
William Prosser (1971) in his treatise, Handbook of the Law of Torts, defined "tort" 
as "a term applied to a miscellaneous and unconnected group of civil wrongs other 
than breach of contract for which a court of law will afford a remedy in the form of 
an action for damages." Besides damages, tort law will tolerate self-help in a limited 
range of cases. For example, using reasonable force to expel a trespasser. 
Furthermore, in the case of a continuing tort, or even where harm is merely 
threatened, the courts will sometimes grant an injunction to minimise the 
continuance or threat of harm. Some engineering disputes, where negligence or 
damages are involved, are decided under the law of tort. 
 
Negligence is the broadest of the torts, forming the basis of many personal 
injury cases. The engineer has to be aware that there is a minimum standard of care 
that must be achieved in everyday activities. The engineer owes a duty of care to the 
client and breaches that duty by doing or not doing certain actions which are 
considered to be negligent. A breach of the duty of care can also occur if certain 
actions are not undertaken. Such a breach must lead to loss or damage, and it is 
generally considered to be fair and reasonable for the negligent party to pay 
compensation to the plaintiff/claimant.  
 
When claiming for damages in tort, due to deceit or negligence, the plaintiff has 
to justify to the court the amount that is being claimed (Cooke, 2001). âThe object is 
to restore the plaintiff to the position in which he would have been placed if the 
wrongful act had not been committedâ (South Australia v Johnson (1982) 42 ALR 
161 at 169â170).  
 
In a case in South Australia, in which excessive cracking occurred in a house 
and was caused by negligent footing design, the court found that 50% was the 
responsibility of the builder, 25% the local authority and 25% the consulting 
engineer who advised the builder. The damages awarded in this case were the cost 
of demolishing and rebuilding the house. The judgement was appealed and 
overturned at the Supreme Court of South Australia but the High Court of Australia 
reinstated the original decision. Such cases have resulted in a strict set of guidelines 
for footing design in South Australia. These judgements have also set a precedent 
for other cases involving damages for defective building work (Thomas, 2004). 
10.7 THE PROCESS OF DISPUTES 
Disputes in the engineering construction industry are of many different types. 
Historically, most disputes are related to defective design and poor workmanship. 
As projects have become more complex, the nature of disputes has involved more 
parties from different disciplines. Traditionally, the mechanism for resolving 
construction disputes has followed a âtieredâ process involving: 
 
 

300 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
ï· 
negotiation; 
ï· 
facilitated negotiation or mediation; 
ï· 
assisted negotiation or conciliation;  
ï· 
expert determination or neutral evaluation; 
ï· 
arbitration; and 
ï· 
litigation. 
 
 
As the dispute escalates through the stages, then so do the time and resources 
required for resolving the dispute.  
 
Negotiation is a relatively inexpensive approach to dispute resolution. It 
generally is an informal process where the parties involved want to achieve 
outcomes as expeditiously as possible. The parties negotiate between themselves 
until a resolution is reached. 
 
Mediation or conciliation can be seen as the next most expensive approach and 
can offer distinct advantages, in that the duration of the process can be pre-
determined with the parties involved deciding the rules under which they and the 
mediator will operate, and the informality of proceedings may make the necessity 
for legal representation less likely. The benefits are a resolution achieved more 
expeditiously and economically. 
 
Expert determination is also favoured as a resolution process, particularly for 
disputes relating to a single issue of a technical nature. Compared with litigation or 
arbitration, expert determination is generally faster and less expensive. In the case 
of complex technical disputes it is arguable that a Tribunal, which does not have 
sufficient (or any) technical literacy, can appropriately handle such disputes. In the 
usual contract situation, the Superintendent, most likely an engineer, is the 
administrator of the Contract between the Principal (client/owner) and Contractor, 
and gives decisions on disputes. Increasingly the Superintendent has been viewed as 
being potentially compromised in this role with disputing parties, particularly those 
aided by legal advisors.  
 
Arbitration previously offered a number of advantages over litigation. These 
entailed: privacy, less rigid procedures and formality; a shorter hearing time; lower 
costs; confidence in using a technical arbitrator; and a significant degree of finality, 
since a sound award is generally difficult to overturn. Arbitration involves each 
party presenting their points of view to an independent arbitrator, who then makes a 
decision. In the present climate in Australia, arbitration has become burdened with 
procedures similar to litigation, involving legal representation and procedural 
formality. The key benefits of time taken to bring a dispute to conclusion, and the 
cost, have escalated within these processes.  
 
Litigation is both costly and time consuming and involves formal court 
processes. Disputes that arise during a project and go to arbitration or litigation are 
now unlikely to be resolved until after construction is complete, because of the 
lengthy procedures.  
 
Because arbitration and litigation have become so costly, alternative methods of 
resolution are being called for in the construction industry. In the meantime, 
conciliation or mediation is being used as an intermediate step, before embarking 
upon the more costly and formal arbitration procedures. 
 
Engineers can find themselves in arbitration, civil court actions, or even criminal 
court actions as an expert witness. An expert witness is usually asked by one or 

Ethics and Law 
301 
 
other of the parties contesting the case to act as independent engineer to investigate 
a failure or inadequate design or just advise on some dispute where an expert 
engineering opinion is required. However, an expert witnessâs general duty is to 
assist the court impartially on matters relevant to the expertâs area of expertise. The 
expert has a duty only to the court and not to the party retaining the expert (i.e., the 
client). Accordingly, an expert witness is not an advocate for the client. The expert 
witness is required to follow the appropriate Court Guidelines for Expert Witnesses 
in fulfilling their duty. After collecting evidence, analysing the data and preparing a 
report, the expert will produce an expert report. It is common for both the plaintiff 
and the defendant to call their own expert witnesses and they present differing 
expert reports. In this case, the court needs to decide the facts of the case. 
 
It is appropriate for lawyers and experts to collaborate on the form of an expert 
report, but not acceptable for litigants or their lawyers to influence the content. 
There is a need to take care and record all communications which are undertaken as 
an expert witness with the litigant, and the instructing lawyers. Generally, such 
communications are protected from disclosure until the expert report is served on 
the other party.  
 
In essence, the expert, because of his or her independence and expertise, is in the 
privileged position of expressing opinions in evidence, in contrast to normal 
witnesses, who deal in facts. 
 
Quite often, when clients receive an impartial report on a matter, they are 
inclined to withdraw the claim. It is likely also that when the prepared report has 
been viewed by the judge this can lead to an order to negotiate settlement outside 
the court. 
10.8 LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY IN MANAGING STAFF 
In many countries in the world, employers are responsible for ensuring that staff 
within their organisations have a healthy and safe place in which to work and do not 
suffer from discrimination. This is applicable to all occupations and the implications 
need to be understood by both the manager, and the staff being managed. National 
laws usually apply to Equal Opportunity, Discrimination, Human Rights and Work 
Health and Safety. 
Equal opportunity and human rights 
In many countries, including the United States, the member states of the European 
Union, the United Kingdom and Australia, there are national laws for equal 
employment opportunity and human rights. In the US, this is administered by the 
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In the UK, the national legislation 
requires organisations to have a written equal opportunities policy with procedures 
covering equal opportunities in recruitment, promotion, transfer, training, dismissal 
and redundancy. In the US, the Federal Laws are usually supplemented by State 
Laws. The Australian Constitution does not give any power to the Federal 
Government to make laws in the area of discrimination. However, once the 
Commonwealth of Australia signs a treaty with an international organization (such 
as the United Nations or associated bodies like the International Labour 
Organization), the Federal Government has an international duty to draw up laws 

302 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
based on the principles in the treaty. Federal laws in Australia based on principles of 
human rights include: 
 
ï· 
The Racial Discrimination Act 1975;  
ï· 
The Sex Discrimination Act 1984; 
ï· 
The Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 (formerly called the   
Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986); 
ï· 
The Privacy Act 1988; 
ï· 
The Disability Discrimination Act 1992; and  
ï· 
The Age Discrimination Act 2004. 
 
Each state government has an Act to promote equal opportunity in organisations and 
communities. For example, in South Australia it is the Equal Opportunity Act (SA), 
1984 which is an act to: "promote equality of opportunity between the citizens of 
this State; to prevent certain kinds of discrimination based on sex, sexuality, marital 
status, pregnancy, race, physical or intellectual impairment or age; to facilitate the 
participation of citizens in the economic and social life of the community; and to 
deal with other related matters." 
 
Equal Opportunity is about a personâs behaviour towards others, or how 
decisions are made in public areas of life. Put simply, it is about the respect to be 
shown to fellow workers. 
 
Anti-discrimination or Equal Opportunity means that all people have a right to 
be treated fairly regardless of irrelevant personal characteristics. For example, it is 
unlawful under the Equal Opportunity Act (SA) 1984 for anyone to be treated 
unfairly based on age; sex; marital status; pregnancy; sexuality; physical or 
intellectual impairment; or race. However, these laws only apply in areas of public 
life (including employment), and private life is excluded. 
 
The work areas covered by the Act include: accommodation; advertising; clubs 
and associations; conferral of qualifications; disposal of land; education; 
employment; and provision of goods and services. In the employment area, the law 
applies to paid full-time, part-time and casual workers, as well as unpaid or contract 
employees. It applies to all stages of employment: job advertisements and 
applications; interviews; promotions; training; and dismissal. In employment, 
Commonwealth laws also cover the following personal characteristics: religion; 
political opinion; medical record; irrelevant criminal record; social origin; and trade 
union activity. This means that some of the current State legislation would have to 
be read in conjunction with the Federal legislation. 
 
 
Application of legislation to employment 
 
Maria sought a promotion to Team Leader of the roadworkâs team at a council 
depot. Although she was an excellent worker and had previous supervisory 
experience, the depot manager decided not to consider her application, believing 
that the all-male staff would not respect her. Maria complained to the 
Commissioner. A representative held discussions with the manager, and Maria 
was given an interview for the team leader job.

Ethics and Law 
303 
 
Work health and safety 
Work health and safety legislation aims to provide a healthy and safe work 
environment for all, whether they are employees, contractors or visitors. In 
Australia, a model Work Health and Safety Act (2012) was introduced for 
enactment by the individual states. In the Act, and accompanying regulations, all 
employers must ensure that each person employed or engaged by the employer is 
safe from injury and risks to health while at work by providing and maintaining a 
safe working environment, safe systems of work, plant and substances in a safe 
condition, adequate facilities for the welfare of employees; and must provide such 
information, training and supervision that are necessary to ensure that each 
employee is safe from injury and risks to health. 
 
 
Worker fatalities involving a fall from height  
(Safe Work Australia, 2013) 
 
While worker health and safety has improved over time, fatalities and injuries still 
occur. Unfortunately, industries related to the engineering profession such as the 
construction industry are over-represented in the statistics.  
 
Between the years 1989 and 1992, there were 214 fatalities (54 per year) 
recorded. Of those fatalities, 12% involved a fall from height. Worker fatalities fell 
to 112 deaths between 2008 and 2011 (28 per year). However, the percentage 
of deaths involving a fall from height remained similar during the period, at 11%.  
 
 
 
 
It is necessary that all employees are aware of the procedures and processes 
involved in creating and maintaining healthy and safe work environments. 
Engineers are often responsible for staff, and they must ensure that breaches of the 
relevant legislation do not occur. Many organisation have management systems 
which are designed to provide processes and templates for use. These processes and 
templates ensure that consistent approaches to induction, training and risk 
management are undertaken. While these processes and templates do assist an 
organisation to demonstrate compliance with the associated legislation, their 
primary aim is to maintain a healthy and safe work environment.  
 
For engineers, responsibilities within the Act extend beyond the standard 
workplace and include a responsibility for designs to integrate control measures 
early in the design process to eliminate or, if this is not reasonably practicable, 
minimise risks to health and safety throughout the life of the system under 
consideration. Health and safety issues are a key consideration in the planning and 
design of any engineering system. This is often referred to as Safe Design Practice, 
Safe by Design, Safety in Design or Prevention by Design. 
 
Engineers need to develop a mindset which holds paramount the need for their 
work to be carried out safely, and that designs are safe for users. This relates to the 
entirety of any project and not just the part that they are directly involved with. This 
mindset extends from the problem formulation phase through detailed planning and 
design to implementation, and ultimately, decommissioning. The requirements of 
legislation of course need to be satisfied, but, more importantly, the safety mindset 
needs to be ingrained in employees through training and awareness programs.

10.9 SUMMARY 
The issues raised in this chapter are of special importance to engineers who are 
responsible for safety procedures in the workplace. They are also relevant to any 
engineer who is making decisions that impinge upon the community, is involved in 
choosing new technology, or is applying existing technology. Engineers must take 
responsibility for their decisions and defend their actions, especially those actions 
and decisions that cannot be supported by scientific and technological argument. 
Engineering has found itself in the middle of some of the largest disasters that have 
occurred both in terms of social distress and provision of a solution. The questions 
of what is justified as a whistle blower or what is obligatory under the code of ethics 
need to be answered by taking into account all the ramifications of a moral dilemma 
for the decision maker.  
PROBLEMS 
10.1 âRelativity applies to physics, not ethicsâ (Albert Einstein). Discuss how this 
statement is important for ethical decisions a professional engineer might make. 
 
10.2 An engineer learns by accident that his employer, a major chemical fertilizer 
company, has been disposing of toxic wastes in an area where the frequency of 
cancer and birth defects is on the rise. He also learns that a TV documentary 
involving local citizens will be aired next week and these citizens are preparing a 
legal suit against the company. He immediately sells all his shares in the company 
and following advice that they have been sold, then tells his CEO what he has 
learned. The legal suit is filed two days later. Has he done anything unethical? 
Please discuss. (Based on an example in Ullmann, 1986.) 
 
10.3. 
How much should you change your behaviour to fit with the beliefs, values 
and norms of those with whom you are interacting with? Whose responsibility is it 
to change: the visitor; sojourner; newcomer; or the host? What about the language 
one speaks? Should a person who comes to Australia be required to speak English?  
Issues: At what point do you give up your cultural identity and moral integrity? At 
what point does adoption of another culture offend or insult? It is necessary to be 
aware of oneâs own moral stance and at the same time the need to display respect 
for others. Discuss with someone and write a paragraph on your outcomes. 
(adapted from http://www2.andrews.edu/~tidwell/bsad560/Ethics.html) 
 
10.4 Compare the Engineering Code of Ethics applicable to the country where you 
are studying with two other countries. If you were to be employed in one of these 
two countries would be there be a need to change your professional conduct? Would 
there be any implications if you were employed in one of the countries, but 
remotely undertaking your engineering work in another?

An employee comes to you to complain about offensive behaviour she has been 
putting up with from another co-worker. She insists, however, that she does not 
want to make a formal complaint. What are some possible steps you might 
consider? Consider and debate the following ideas: 
 
 
(a) Ask her why she insists on not proceeding further with her complaint; 
 
(b) Respect her right not to proceed with a formal complaint and inform her of 
your duty of care to protect her and other workers; 
 
(c) Monitor the situation and follow up with her to see if the problem gets any 
worse; and 
 
(d) Consider recirculating relevant policies or codes of conduct to all employees. 
 
10.6 There are many resources available on the web. Search your local Equal 
Opportunity website and one in another country and compare the differences in 
rulings on a number of different aspects, such as religion, age and racial 
discrimination. 
 
10.7 Identify and discuss a legal case where a prosecution has occurred for a design 
which was not considered safe. What lessons could be learned for this case? 
 
10.8 A professional engineer is walking past a building site (in which he or she has 
no professional involvement) and notice that the scaffolding is quite unsafe. Discuss 
whether he or she has a legal or an ethical obligation to report this? If so, what 
action should he or she take?

CHAPTER ELEVEN  
Risk and Reliability  
 
In this chapter we consider the concepts of risk and reliability and how they can be 
considered in engineering planning and design. The concepts of risk and reliability 
are defined and illustrated in relation to engineering problems. Reliability-based 
design and the selection of safety coefficients are explained in detail. The concepts 
of resilience, vulnerability and robustness are also introduced. Methods for 
evaluating the reliability of engineering components and engineering systems are 
explained. 
11.1 INTRODUCTION 
Risk is inherent in all human activity. For example, we risk personal accident, 
injury and even death whenever we travel in a car, go for a jog, or cross the street. 
The levels of such everyday risks depend, in part, on the way individuals choose to 
conduct their lives. Generally, such risk levels are very low in modern society, 
unlike the risks faced daily by our ancestors in pre-historic times. The probabilities 
associated with the risks associated with various everyday activities have been 
estimated in a number of studies (US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 1975; 
Stone, 1988; Morgan, 1990; BC Hydro, 1993). Some of these probabilities are 
given in Table 11.1. 
 
Risk is also inherent in all engineering work, as was explained in Chapter 3, 
and part of the role of the engineer is to manage risk levels and to keep them to the 
very low levels that are acceptable  to society.  
11.2 LEVELS OF RISK 
Dougherty and Fragola (1988) define risk as the combination of the probability of 
an abnormal event or failure and the consequences of that event or failure to a 
projectâs success or a systemâs performance. This combination of probability (or 
likelihood) and consequences is used in tables of risk ratings such as Table 11.2. 
 
In Table 11.2 catastrophic consequences would involve loss of life, major 
consequences include serious injury or major economic loss, moderate 
consequences include minor injuries or moderate economic loss, and minor 
consequences include minor economic loss. Efforts to minimise risk should give 
priority to the activities that have an extreme or high risk rating.

For example, the risk levels that are applied in the planning, design and 
construction of a city office building vary widely. The structural design objectives 
are to provide a system which will have adequate safety against collapse, as well as 
good serviceability under normal working loads. These objectives are quantified 
using minimum performance levels. In regard to serviceability, a maximum 
allowable deflection is prescribed for the floors and is not to be exceeded when the 
design working loads are applied. In regard to safety against collapse, minimum 
levels of overload due to live load, wind and earthquake are prescribed that the 
structural system must be able to withstand.  It will be clear that the consequences 
of exceeding the deflection criterion will be at most minor, whereas not meeting 
the minimum strength requirements could well be catastrophic. For this reason the 
acceptable probability of excessive deflection is much higher than the acceptable 
probability of collapse.

Risk of gastroenteritis among young children who consume rainwater in 
South Australia 
 
Eighty-two percent of rural households in South Australia have rainwater tanks 
as their main source of drinking water. There are some risks associated with the 
consumption of rainwater as it may be contaminated by pathogens from birds or 
animals. A study was carried out to assess whether there was a significant 
difference in the risk of gastroenteritis among 4- to 6-year old children who drank 
rainwater compared to those who drank treated mains water. 
Over 1000 children were included in the study which was carried out over a 
six-week period. Parents of the children were asked to keep a diary of 
gastrointestinal symptoms. The occurrence of gastroenteritis was based on a set 
of symptoms (defined as a highly credible gastrointestinal illness or HCGI). It 
should be noted that most incidences of gastroenteritis were mild. 
Based on the raw data, the incidence of HCGI was 4.7 episodes per child-
year for those who only drank rainwater compared to 7.3 episodes per child-year 
for those who only drank mains water. However, when adjustments were made 
for other risk factors, there was no significant difference in the incidence of HCGI 
between the two groups. The study concluded that consumption of rainwater did 
not increase the risk of gastroenteritis compared with mains water for 4- to 6-
year old children. One possible reason for this conclusion is the acquired 
immunity by the children who drank rainwater, as they had all done so for at least 
a year prior to the study and could have developed immunity to a number of 
microorganisms during this period.

11.3 RELIABILITY BASED DESIGN 
The reliability of an engineering component or system is defined as the probability 
that the system will be in a non-failure state. The possible modes of failure need to 
be defined for each particular system under consideration. For example, for a water 
supply system, one failure mode would correspond to running out of water, 
although a more likely mode would occur with the imposition of extreme water 
restrictions on household consumers and industry. Yet another mode would be the 
provision of water of an unacceptable quality to consumers. For a freeway system, 
failure could correspond to extreme congestion associated with low vehicle speeds 
and long delays.  
 
In this section, a simplified example of reliability-based design will be 
explained using a simple structural element in tension. The same principles apply 
to many other types of engineering systems.  
 
In structural engineering, probabilities of failure are rarely calculated for 
design calculations. The usual practice is apply overload factors to the load 
quantities and understrength terms to the resistance quantities. However, the 
probability of failure is taken into account in evaluating these âsafety factorsâ.  
This approach will be demonstrated for the design of simple tension members. 
Some examples of these are shown in Figure 11.1.

                                                                    Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 11.1 Examples of tension members (Lift cable, tie in a bridge truss, and cable supporting a 
roof). 
 
 
 
Consider the analysis of a tension member (or tie) of cross-sectional area, A, 
as shown in Figure 11.1. If the maximum force that will be applied to the member 
during its lifetime, S, is known, the maximum stress in the member, ï³, can be 
calculated using the equation: 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
(11.1) 
 
where A = the cross-sectional area of the member. If ï³ is less than the stress that 
will cause failure of the member, ï³f, the member will not fail. In the design 
situation, the failure stress of the steel and the maximum applied force are assumed

                                                                                                                    311 
 
to be known, hence the required cross-sectional area of the member, A, can be 
determined by rearranging Equation 11.1 to give: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(11.2) 
 
 
 
However, this approach does not take into account uncertainty in S, ï³f, and A. 
Clearly the maximum force that will be applied to the member during its lifetime is 
not known with certainty. There can also be variations in the failure stress of the 
steel that comprises the member due to variations in the manufacturing process. 
Finally, the actual cross-sectional area of the member may vary from the value 
specified in the design due to variations in production of the member.  
 
One approach that provides some margin of safety in the design is to use a 
safety factor. If we define T, the resistance of the member, as: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(11.3) 
 
 
We require T to exceed S by some margin to allow for the possibilities of 
overloads and understrength. We define the safety factor, ï§ï¬ï  as follows: 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
(11.4) 
 
where ï§ is typically in the range 1.5â3.0 depending on the loading conditions, 
material and likely mode of failure. The cross-sectional area of the member is then 
determined by combining Equations (11.3) and (11.4) as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(11.5) 
 
 
The single safety factor approach is no longer commonly used in structural 
engineering design, but is still used in geotechnical engineering. Structural 
engineers now use a reliability-based approach to structural design. This approach 
explicitly recognises the uncertainties in the various factors involved in the design. 
In the reliability approach, we define the difference between T and S as the safety 
margin, Z. 
 
 
 
i.e.: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(11.6) 
 
 
We expect variations in T and S due to some of the factors described 
previously. We will assume that T and S are normally distributed random variables 
that are independent of each other. Typical distributions of these variables are 
shown in Figure 11.2. This figure shows some small but finite probability that 
either T or S is negative. Clearly negative values of T or S are physically 
impossible, as the normal distribution is only an approximation to the true 
distributions of the resistance T and maximum applied force S.

Let the means of T and S be designated by ï­(T) and ï­(S) (respectively) and 
the standard deviations of T and S be designated by ï³(T) and ï³(S) (respectively). 
Then, if both T and S have normal distributions, so will Z. The mean and standard 
deviation of Z can be determined using Equations (11.7) and (11.8).

Figure 11.3 Probability distribution of the safety margin, Z. 
 
 
If Z is negative, the member will fail, if it is positive, the member will not 
fail. The probability of failure, Pf , is given by Equation (11.9): 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(11.9) 
 
 
As stated earlier, the reliability of a system, R is defined as the probability 
that the system will be in a non-failure state. Hence:

A commonly used measure of safety is the safety index, ï¢, which is defined 
as: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(11.11) 
 
where V(Z) = the coefficient of variation of Z = ï³(Z)/ï­(Z). For the case where Z 
follows a normal distribution, ï¢ is related to the probability of failure as indicated 
in Table 11. 3.

distribution (adapted from Warner et al., 1998).

As T and S are now both considered to be random variables, the safety factor 
defined in Equation (11.4) may be expressed in terms of the mean values of T and 
S. 
 
 
 
i.e.,  
  
 
 
 
 
(11.12)  
 
where ï§0 is called the central safety factor. Warner et al. (1998) show that ï¢ is 
related to ï§0 by the following expression: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(11.13) 
 
where V(T) and V(S) are the coefficients of variation of T and S (respectively). 
 
Hence in order to maintain the same safety index (and hence probability of 
failure) ï§0 must vary depending the values of V(T) and V(S).  
 
As noted previously, a major weakness of using ï§0 is that it does not take into 
account variations in T and S. This may be overcome to some extent by using more 
extreme values of T and S. For example, define Sk as the value of the applied load S 
that has a 5% chance of being exceeded. Furthermore, define Tk as the value of the 
resistance T that has a 95% chance of being exceeded. Then the ânominalâ safety 
factor is given by the following equation: 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
(11.14) 
 
thus, we use a high value of the applied load and low value of the resistance in 
assessing the nominal safety factor. 
 
Figure 11.4 shows the relationship between the distributions of T and S and 
the values of Tk and Sk. Modern structural codes of practice use partial safety 
coefficients to allow for the variabilities in T and S separately. The partial safety

coefficients are applied to Tk and Sk to obtain design values Td and Sd as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(11.15) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(11.16)

Values of the partial safety coefficients, ï§T and ï§S, are selected to ensure that 
that the probability of failure, Pf, given by Equation (11.9) lies within an acceptable 
range. 
 
It should be noted that the approach outlined above is based on a number of 
simplifying assumptions such as that T and S are independent and have normal 
distributions. Furthermore, even in the simple case of a tensile member, the 
variability in T can be due to variations in materials properties as well as variations 
in the actual dimensions of the member compared to those assumed in the design. 
For this reason, the probability of failure determined is usually referred to as a 
nominal probability of failure. 
 
A similar approach to that outlined above can be used for other structural 
elements such as beams, columns and frames or other engineering components 
such as electrical transformers, items of machinery or distillation columns. 
 
Of course, the analysis of an entire system is more complicated. For example, 
a building structure may have many components, alternative load paths and inbuilt 
redundancies as well as many different modes of failure. 
 
Furthermore, it should be noted that the above analysis assumes that 
structural failure will occur due to unusually high loads or low resistance of the 
structural member itself (due to lower than expected material properties or 
dimensions). In reality, it has been observed that most structural failures occur due 
to human error caused by factors such as:

This underlines the need for proper quality control in engineering design and 
construction including appropriate work practices, supervision and checking. 
11.4 SELECTION OF SAFETY COEFFICIENTS 
As outlined in Chapter 3, most engineering design work is guided by codes of 
practice that specify minimum levels of safety to ensure that the frequency of 
failure is within limits that are acceptable to the community. The setting of these 
levels of safety involves a balancing act between overly conservative design on the 
one hand and unconservative design on the other. If the levels of safety chosen lead 
to overly conservative design, money will be spent on achieving these high 
standards that could be better employed elsewhere in the economy (e.g. building 
new hospitals or purchasing additional medical equipment). If the levels of safety 
are too low, failures (and the consequent loss of life and/or economic loss) will 
occur more frequently than is acceptable to the community and there will be a 
public outcry. 
 
Following Warner et al. (1998), it is appropriate to consider the choice of the 
optimum probability of failure for a particular class of structure (e.g. highway 
bridges). Clearly as the probability of failure, Pf increases the cost associated with 
the failure of all bridges also increases as shown in Figure 11.5. On the other hand, 
increasing the probability of failure is associated with reducing the margin of 
safety and hence the cost of constructing all bridges as shown in Figure 11.5. The 
total cost is the cost of failures plus the cost of construction of all highway bridges. 
The value of Pf that corresponds to the minimum total cost is the optimum 
probability of failure. In practice, this value may be quite difficult to identify and 
values of the partial safety coefficients, ï§T and ï§S are often specified in codes of 
practice based on experience with previous successful design procedures and 
comparison with a number of standard design cases.

11.5 RELIABILITY, RESILIENCE, VULNERABILITY AND 
ROBUSTNESS 
The reliability of an engineering system is defined in Section 11.3 as the 
probability that it is in a non-failure state at any point in time. Reliability is clearly 
an important performance indicator for most engineering systems. However, it 
does not give the total picture. Hashimoto et al. (1982) identified the following 
three performance measures of a water resource system: reliability, resiliency and 
vulnerability.  
 
Hashimoto et al (1982) defined resiliency as the probability of a system 
returning from a failure state to a non-failure state in a single time step. This is 
equal to one divided by the average length of time that a systemâs performance 
remains unsatisfactory after a failure. Clearly this definition of resiliency does not 
apply if system failure corresponds to a catastrophic collapse (e.g., of a building or 
other structure) from which recovery is impossible. However, it is applicable to 
systems where failure corresponds to economic loss or inconvenience. For 
example, the imposition of water restrictions in a city, flooding of an urban area or 
severe traffic congestion that causes significant delays on a road network. In these 
cases, it is possible for the system to recover from the failure and perform in a 
satisfactory manner for an extended period thereafter. 
 
Note that the terms âresilienceâ and âresiliencyâ tend to be used 
interchangeably in the literature. From this point onwards, we will use the term 
resilience throughout. A more general definition of resilience is the ability of a 
system to recover from large perturbations without changing its basic structure 
(Fiksel, 2003). This definition is commonly applied to ecological (Holling, 1973) 
or socio-economic systems (Resilience Alliance, 2010). This is related to the 
concept of stability for mechanical systems. A system is said to be in a stable state 
if, when perturbed, it returns to that state.  
  
 
The consideration of resilience in the planning or design of an engineering 
system leads to a fundamentally different approach to that based purely on system 
reliability. Reliability-based design considers the systemâs performance during 
periods when it is subject to standard loading conditions and the required 
performance criteria are expected to be met. Hence, reliability-based design is 
aimed at avoiding failure or providing âfail-safeâ performance. Conversely, 
resilience considers performance during periods when the required performance 
criteria are not met (i.e. the system is in a failure state). Hence the aim of 
resilience-based design is to recover from failure and to ensure that the system is 
âsafe to failâ (Butler et al, 2016). 
 
The structural design of buildings in areas with significant likelihood of the 
occurrence of earthquakes is an example of resilient design. Such structures are 
designed to withstand the loads imposed by a specific design earthquake with 
minimal damage. However, in recognition that it is possible that a larger 
earthquake could occur, the beams, columns and joints of the structure are 
designed to be ductile, so that, should failure occur, it will not result in a 
catastrophic collapse of the building. As shown in Figure 11.6, large deformations 
of the structure may occur, but, provided its structural integrity is maintained, there 
will be a good chance that the occupants will survive the earthquake.

Hashimoto et al. (1982) defined vulnerability as the average magnitude of 
failure of a system, given that it does fail. This is sometimes expressed as a 
percentage of the average demand or load on the system, so that it is 
dimensionless. It is desirable for a system to have high values of reliability and 
resilience but a low value of vulnerability. However, Hashimoto et al. (1982) 
showed that, for a water resource system there is usually a trade-off between the 
three measures, so that the system that has the lowest vulnerability is unlikely to 
have the highest reliability or the highest resilience and vice versa. 
 
Another concept related to system performance is robustness. Robustness is a 
measure of the insensitivity of the performance of a given system or plan to 
uncertain future conditions (Maier et al., 2016). Hence a robust system or plan is 
one that performs well over a wide range of future conditions or scenarios. The 
concept is illustrated by the example given in the following interest box.

Reliability, Vulnerability and Robustness of Southern Adelaideâs Water 
Supply System 
 
Paton et al. (2014) carried out a multi-objective planning study of future water 
supply options for Southern Adelaide, south Austrialia. The population of the area is 
approximately 600,000 people. In 2009 the cityâs water supply was provided 
primarily from reservoirs in the nearby Mount Lofty Ranges and inter-basin 
transfers from the River Murray (70 km to the east of the city). Future water supply 
options considered were combinations of the following: a desalination plant (of 
various capacities), a number of stormwater harvesting schemes (for non-potable 
supply) and household rainwater tanks. The planning horizon was from 2010 to 
2050. The objectives considered were to: (a) minimise the present value of capital 
and operating costs of the system; (b) minimise the total greenhouse gas 
emissions; and (c) minimise vulnerability of the system (maximum shortfall in 
supply). Each of these was evaluated for the full planning horizon. 
The system reliability was constrained to be greater than or equal to 95% and 
the average maximum duration of failure (corresponding to the imposition of severe 
water restrictions) was constrained to be less than or equal to 365 days. The 
average maximum duration of failure is the inverse of the resilience of the system 
according to the definition of Hashimoto et al. (1982). 
The optimisation was carried out for the most likely climate change scenario 
and a medium level of population growth. A post-optimality analysis of system 
robustness was carried out for selected plans that were identified in the multi-
objective optimisation. The aim of this analysis was to consider how the various 
plans performed under changes in meteorological factors due to climate change 
and changes in demand due to different population projections. Each plan was 
evaluated under 252 possible scenarios. These were combinations of 7 possible 
global circulation models, 6 emissions scenarios and 6 projections of future 
population for the city. Robustness for each plan was defined as the percentage of 
the 252 scenarios under which the plan exhibited acceptable performance. 
Acceptable performance was defined as follows: (a) reliability greater than or equal 
to 95%; (b) maximum duration of failure less than or equal to 365 days; and (c) 
maximum vulnerability less than or equal to 27% of demand. 
A summary of the objectives and performance measures for the six selected 
plans is given in the table below. The selection of a final plan requires the use of 
multi-criteria analysis methods (Section 12.7) considering all six objectives and 
performance metrics.

11.6 RELIABILITY OF ENGINEERING COMPONENTS 
Many engineering systems contain a large number of components, any one of 
which can fail at a particular point in time with varying consequences to the overall 
system performance. For example, a water supply system for a city may consist of 
thousands of pipes, hundreds of pumps and valves and tens of tanks. The impact of 
the failure of each one of these will vary depending on its function and location in 
the system, its capacity, the time of day and of the year, the number of customers 
affected and so on. We now want to consider how the reliability of system 
components may vary over time. 
 
Figure 11.7 shows a commonly observed pattern for failure rates of 
engineering components (Agarwal, 1993; Hyman 1998). This is the so-called âbath 
tubâ model of component failures.  
 
The probability of failure per unit time is high initially during the âbreak in 
periodâ, as some components fail due to poor materials or workmanship as they are 
placed under stress for the first time. During the mature phase of operation, a small 
number of failures occur due to unexpected causes such as occasional high loads or 
localised weak points. During this period, the failure rate per unit time is 
approximately constant. As the components begin to reach the end of their useful 
lives, the failure rate starts to increase as the effect of corrosion and fatigue take 
effect. This is the so-called âwear out periodâ. 
 
A simple analysis can be carried out for the mature phase by assuming that 
the probability of a component failure per unit time is constant and equals ï¬. Under 
these conditions, Hyman (1998) derives the following equation for the reliability of 
a component: 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
(11.19) 
 
where R(t) is the probability that the component does not fail in the time period 0 
to t.

Another important measure is the mean time to failure, MTTF, which is 
defined as the average time that a component will be in service before failure

occurs. Hyman (1998) shows that the following relationship holds: 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
(11.20) 
 
Example: Light bulbs manufactured by a particular company have a mean time to 
failure of 250 hours. Assuming that the bulbs have a constant probability of failure, 
what is their reliability for a period of 100 hours? 250 hours? 
 
Answer: Applying Equation (11.20),  
 
 
 
 hour-1 
 
therefore: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thus, only 36.8% percent of the light bulbs are expected to last to the mean 
time to failure and 67% will last 100 hours or more. The apparently high failure 
rate in the first 100 hours (33%) is a consequence of the assumption of a constant 
failure rate. In reality, they are more likely to have a low initial failure rate that 
gradually builds up over time. 
11.7 SYSTEM RELIABILITY 
As noted earlier, an engineering system is composed of a large number of non-
identical components that interact in some defined way. The failure of individual 
components can have different consequences on the performance of the system as a 
whole, depending on the nature of the components and how they are connected 
together. We will consider two simple cases to demonstrate this effect.  
Series System 
Consider a system that consists of a set of components in series. For example, 
consider a chain comprised of n links. The failure of any one of the links will cause 
the chain to fail. From elementary probability theory, the probability that the 
system does not fail is the product of the individual probabilities of non-failure 
(assuming that the failure of each component is independent), i.e., 
 
 
 
Ü´à¯¦à¯à¯¥à¯à¯à¯¦= Ü´à¬µÃ Ü´à¬¶Ã Ü´à¬·Ã â¦ Ü´à¯Ã â¦ Ü´à¯¡ 
 
 
(11.21) 
 
where Rseries is the reliability of the series system and Ri is the reliability of 
component i. Therefore, a series system has a reliability that is less than the lowest 
reliability of any of its components.

In the special case that each component has a failure rate that is constant with 
time, Equation (11.19) gives: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(11.22) 
 
and hence Equation (11.21) becomes:  
 
 
 
Ü´à¯¦à¯à¯¥à¯à¯à¯¦= Ýà¬¿ï¬à°­à¯§Ã Ýà¬¿ï¬à°®à¯§Ã Ýà¬¿ï¬à°¯à¯§Ã â¦ Ýà¬¿ï¬à³à¯§Ã â¦ Ýà¬¿ï¬à³à¯§  
(11.23)  
 
hence: 
 
 
 
 
 
Ü´à¯¦à¯à¯¥à¯à¯à¯¦= Ýà¬¿ï¬à³à¯§  
 
 
 
 
(11.24) 
 
where the failure rate of the series system per unit time is given by: 
 
 
 
  
 
 
(11.25) 
 
 
Thus, in a series system where each component has a constant failure rate, 
the system failure rate will also be constant and will equal the sum of the 
individual failure rates. 
Parallel Systems 
A parallel system will not fail unless every component of the system fails. An 
example is a set of parallel pipes supplying water to part of a city. Clearly if one 
pipe fails, water can still be supplied to the city (presumably at a reduced pressure 
or level of service). However, if failure is defined as having no water available, all 
pipes must fail before system failure occurs. 
 
For a parallel system with n components, the probability of system failure is 
the probability that all components fail. Therefore, (assuming independence of the 
individual components) the probability of failure for the system as a whole is given 
by:  
 
 
Ü²à¯.à¯£à¯à¯¥à¯à¯à¯à¯à¯= Ü²à¯à¬µÃ Ü²à¯à¬¶Ã â¦Ü²à¯à¯Ã â¦ Ü²à¯à¯¡  
 
 
(11.26) 
 
where Pf.parallel is the probability of failure of a parallel system and Pfi is the 
probability of failure of component i. As reliability is defined as one minus the 
probability of failure, Equation (11.26) becomes: 
 
àµ«1 âÜ´à¯£à¯à¯¥à¯à¯à¯à¯à¯àµ¯= (1 âÜ´à¬µ) Ã (1 âÜ´à¬¶) Ã â¦ (1 âÜ´à¯) Ã â¦ (1 âÜ´à¯¡) (11.27) 
 
 
It can be shown that the reliability of a parallel system is always greater than 
the reliability of its most reliable component. Given this high level of reliability, 
why donât we design all engineering systems as parallel systems? The answer is 
that there is a high cost of providing redundancy. Parallel systems are used when 
high levels of reliability are required. For example, all hospitals have an emergency

power supply consisting of a motor-generator set that will start if the regular 
supply of electricity fails. This ensures that patients on life support systems are not 
at risk in the event of a power failure. Most pumping stations are designed to have 
a number of pumps in parallel. This not only allows for the flow provided by the 
pumps to vary as the demand on the system varies, but also allows for redundancy 
should one of the pumps break down. 
 
Unlike series systems, parallel systems do not have constant failure rates per 
unit time, even if all of their components do. 
Mixed Systems 
Many real engineering systems do not correspond to simple series or parallel 
systems. They are described as mixed systems. A mixed system can be analysed by 
breaking it into a set of series and parallel systems and calculating the reliability 
one step at a time. For example, Figure 11.8(a) shows a mixed system. Figures 
11.8(b) through 11.8(e) show thesteps involved in computing its reliability.

11.8 SUMMARY 
Knowledge of the concepts of risk and reliability are fundamental to the planning 
and design of engineering systems. Risk involves two components: the likelihood 
of an abnormal event or failure occurring and the consequences of that event or 
failure. All humans face risks on a daily basis. While the probability of failure of 
engineering systems cannot be reduced to zero, it is the role of the engineer to 
ensure that this probability is kept within bounds that are acceptable to the 
community.  
 
The reliability of a system at a particular point in time is the probability that 
it will be in a non-failure state at that time. Engineering systems can be designed to 
achieve a specified level of reliability due to known hazards, although there are 
often unexpected hazards that are impossible to quantify. In the latter case, 
planning and design must rely on past experience or obtaining additional 
information that can help quantify the risks. Identification of the appropriate level 
of reliability of an engineering system may be viewed as a trade-off between the 
cost of construction or manufacture and the expected cost due to failure.  
 
In addition to reliability, resilience, vulnerability and robustness of a system 
may also be important in planning and design. Resilience is the probability of the 
system returning from a failure state to a non-failure state in a single time step. 
Vulnerability is the average magnitude of failure of a system, given that it does 
fail. A system with a high reliability does not necessarily have a high resiliency or 
low vulnerability and vice versa. Robustness is a measure of the insensitivity of the 
performance of a given system or plan to uncertain future conditions. 
 
Most engineering components wear out over time. Knowledge of this 
behaviour can be used to assess the reliability of a system or component over a 
specified period and hence to plan the repair or replacement of components in an 
optimal fashion. 
 
An engineering system is usually composed of many different components, 
each with its own reliability. The reliability of the system can be determined based 
on the reliabilities of its individual components and the manner in which they are 
connected. However, the calculations can be very complex.  Series systems and 
parallel systems represent simple cases of engineering systems.

CHAPTER TWELVE  
Engineering Decision Making 
 
Decision making is an essential part of engineering work, and, in a real sense, 
planning and design are sequential decision-making processes. This chapter begins 
with a short introduction to mathematical decision theory, which is based on the 
criterion of maximising monetary gain, or, more generally, maximising utility. A 
short review is then given of game theory, which studies decisions that are made in 
competitive situations. Although engineering decision problems are often too 
complex to be amenable to analysis using decision theory and game theory, these 
disciplines provide a useful framework for approaching and structuring 
engineering decision problems. One complicating factor in engineering decision 
making is that there will often not be just one decision criterion to apply, but 
several, or even many. A further complication is that there can be many 
stakeholders involved in the decisions. Although it is not possible to find rigorous 
solutions for complex decision problems, there are techniques that can lead to good 
and practical (if not optimal) outcomes. These are discussed at the end of this 
chapter.   
12.1 INTRODUCTION 
Decision making is an essential activity in the work of engineers and other 
professionals, as well as in our personal life. Each day we make countless personal 
decisions: they begin when we wake up in the morning and end only when we go to 
sleep at night. Most are routine and are undertaken almost automatically, with little 
thought or pre-planning. For example, when to get up in the morning, which clothes 
to wear, and what to eat for breakfast, are routine decisions for most people. Some 
engineering decisions are also minor and can be treated routinely, as for example 
when a specific type of vibrator is to be chosen from the commercial range 
available, for use in placing and compacting fresh concrete.  
 
On the other hand, some decisions, both private and professional, require more 
careful attention, perhaps because there are long-term consequences or because 
large sums of money are involved. The purchase of an automobile is a personal 
decision that would not be routine for many people. We need to have at hand a 
good, reliable decision-making procedure for such circumstances. A common-sense 
approach consists of the following steps: 
 
identify the alternative courses of action that are available;  
work out the consequences that can follow from each of these actions, and their 
relative likelihood of occurrence; and  
compare and evaluate the consequences, using some criterion such as minimum cost 
or personal preference, and hence identify the best action.  
 

Engineering Decision-making

This approach to decision making is sound and rational, and bears similarities 
to the basic approach to planning and design that was discussed in Chapter 3. 
However, it cannot be implemented unless appropriate decision criteria are 
available for evaluating the alternative outcomes, and hence ranking them. Such 
criteria depend on the type of decision being made and possibly also on the specific 
details of each decision.  
Decision theory 
Decision problems have been studied mathematically since the 17th and 18th 
Centuries, when Blaise Pascal and Daniel Bernoulli made the first pioneering 
contributions to the emerging field of decision theory. Many of the early theoretical 
studies were of gambling decisions in which maximising monetary outcome was the 
objective. Today, there is a large body of knowledge that provides decision criteria 
and methods of analysis for many different decision problems. Although these 
problems tend to be simple and rather idealised when compared with the real-world 
situations that occur in engineering practice, they do have practical applications. 
Even when no theoretical approach is directly applicable to a specific decision, a 
useful insight into the decision-making process, and into the structuring of a 
problem, can be obtained from a study of decision theory. Decision theory deals 
with a range of problem types, but usually only a single criterion is employed, such 
as monetary value. To provide a brief introduction to decision theory, we will look 
at the following types of decisions:  
 
One-off and many-off decisions: A one-off decision is made when there is a 
unique set of circumstances that will not be repeated. An example is the siting of a 
dam. In contrast, a many-off decision applies when a single decision is applied to 
many identical situations. For example, when an automobile manufacturer chooses a 
new electro-mechanical device for the automatic parking of vehicles, the intention is 
to make many thousands of installations, and it is in this sense that the decision is 
many-off. The distinction between many-off and one-off decisions is important 
because different decision criteria may be required to deal with each case.  
 
Single-stage and multi-stage decisions: A single-stage decision is simply a 
one-off decision, while a multi-stage decision consists of a sequence of inter-related 
decisions, so that the outcome of the n-th decision could depend on previous 
decisions and outcomes. Planning and design are, in effect, multi-stage decision 
processes. An example of a single-stage decision is the siting of a new airport for a 
city. An example of a multi-stage decision sequence is a week-by-week program for 
operating a system of reservoirs to supply water and hydro-electricity to a city. 
 
Decisions with risk, certainty, uncertainty and ignorance of outcome: An 
important distinction to be made among decisions depends on the amount of 
information available to the decision maker. In a decision with risk of outcome all 
the possible outcomes for each possible course of action are known in advance, as 
well as the probability of occurrence of each outcome. If more information is 
available, so that the decision maker knows which single outcome will necessarily 
follow on from each possible action, we say that there is certainty of outcome. This 
is a no-risk situation. Uncertainty of outcome exists when much less information is 
available, so that although all possible outcomes for each action are known, there is 
not enough information available to evaluate their relative probabilities. In an even 

Engineering Decision-making 
 
 
 
329
less-desirable situation for the decision maker, the information available is so 
meagre that the outcomes from a possible course of action are unknown. In such a 
situation, which we will refer to as ignorance of outcome, the decision maker should 
consider postponing the decision and âbuyâ (or in some other way obtain) additional 
information and so improve the situation to one of uncertainty, or possibly risk. 
Deferral of a decision for the purpose of obtaining additional information is often 
appropriate, also for uncertainty problems and even for risk problems, and is an 
option always to be considered.  
 
The types of decisions just mentioned are studied in decision theory using the 
criterion of dollar value, or more generally utility, and are discussed in Sections 
12.2 to 12.6 of this chapter. 
Game theory 
Engineering and business decisions are often made in situations where there are 
other participants in competition with the decision maker. For example, when 
several construction companies tender for the same project, each company chooses 
a specific tender price from a range of feasible values, knowing that the outcome of 
the tendering process will depend on the courses of action of all the competitors. 
Game theory is a relatively new field of mathematics which extends the ideas of 
decision theory to deal with such competitive situations. A brief introduction is 
given to game theory in Section 12.7. 
Complex engineering decisions with multiple criteria and multiple participants 
Engineering decision problems become complex when there is not just one 
criterion, such as cost, but many relevant and even conflicting ones to consider. 
Engineering decisions can become even more complicated, and sometimes 
intractable (in the sense discussed in Chapter 3) when various persons and/or 
organisations are affected by the outcomes. As stakeholders, they can take part in 
the decision making. Researchers have found that optimal mathematical solutions 
are rarely feasible in these circumstances. On the other hand, there are pragmatic 
approaches that can provide realistic and acceptable solutions that are âgoodâ, if not 
optimal. A discussion of practical approaches to complex engineering decision 
making is presented in Sections 12.8 and 12.9 of this chapter.  
12.2 SINGLE-STAGE DECISIONS WITH RISK OF OUTCOME  
In a single-stage decision with risk of outcome, the possible alternative courses of 
action are known and are denoted as a1, .. ai, .. am. The possible outcomes from each 
action ai are also known, and are denoted as Oi1, .. Oij, .. Oin. The outcome that 
results from any action ai depends not on the decision maker, but on chance and 
outside circumstances. The number of outcomes may differ from action to action, 
but if we take n to be the maximum number of outcomes among all the actions, we 
can introduce nil entries as needed to create an mxn format for the problem.  
 
It is sometimes convenient to recast this situation by imagining various 
possible states of nature that can follow on after a course of action has been chosen, 
and which will determine the outcome of the action. The states of nature are 

Engineering Decision-making 
 
 
 
330
denoted as S1, .. Sj .. Sn, and one of these, say Sj, is the one that in fact occurs and 
determines the outcome of decision ai, which is O(ai, Sj), or, as previously, Oij. 
Problem formulation in terms of states of nature can be advantageous in some 
situations and will be used in later sections of this chapter. 
 
Risk of outcome means that the decision maker has sufficient information 
available to estimate the relative probabilities of occurrence of the outcomes of each 
action. For action ai the probability of occurrence of outcome Oij is pij.  
 
The following example illustrates the decision-under-risk problem: A 
construction company is considering hiring new equipment to speed up its 
construction operations. The alternative is the status quo. The hiring cost of the new 
system is estimated to be an additional $5m (million) per year. After checking past 
records of the companyâs operations, it is considered that the success or otherwise 
of the new equipment will depend on the type of work coming in.  
 
After some simplification and idealisation, three possible outcomes are chosen 
to apply if the new equipment is hired: in the best case, there will be an increase in 
efficiency which leads to profits of $19.5m (million) per year, with a 60 percent 
probability. The second possibility is that a profit of $15m is obtained, with a 
likelihood of 25 percent. The third, and worst case scenario, is a loss of $15m at a 
probability of 15 percent. The hire cost of $5m for the new equipment must be 
subtracted from each of these outcomes. For the option of staying with the current 
equipment, it is estimated that the profit for the year will either be $5m, with a 
probability of 40 percent, or $8m with a probability of 60 percent.  
 
There are two actions to compare, with five possible outcomes that are stated 
directly in dollar values. The actions are:  
 
 
 
a1: hire the new equipment on a yearly basis; or 
 
 
a2: stay with the current equipment arrangement. 
 
The dollar outcomes for action a1, including the hiring cost of $5m, are 
 
 
 
O11: a profit of $14.5m, with a probability of 0.6; 
 
 
O12: a profit of $10.0m, with a probability of 0.25; 
 
 
O13: a loss of    $20.0m, with a probability of 0.15. 
 
The outcomes for action a2 are: 
 
 
 
O21: a profit of $5.0m, with a probability of 0.4; 
 
 
O22: a profit of $8.0m, with a probability of 0.6. 
Decision tree representation of a decision with risk of outcome 
This type of problem can be represented graphically using what is known as a 
decision tree, which can be easier to comprehend than the verbal statement of the 
problem. Figure 12.1 below shows the decision tree for this example.  
 
 

Engineering Decision-making

Figure 12.1 Decision tree for the building company decision. 
 
In such a tree, a small square box represents a decision node and a small circle 
represents an outcome node. The possible actions are represented by lines 
emanating from decision nodes. In Figure 12.1, the two action lines a1 and a2 each 
end in an outcome node because this is a one-step decision. Lines emanating from a 
(circular) outcome node represent the possible outcomes from a course of action. 
Each outcome line is tagged (in general, as Oij) and the probability of occurrence of 
the outcome is also shown. In Figure 12.1, the action lines a1 and a2 have three and 
two possible outcomes, respectively. In this example, each outcome is expressed as 
a dollar value, Oij = V(Oij), and the dollar values are given in the boxes on the right 
side at the end of the outcome lines. Note that the sum of probabilities for lines 
emanating from any outcome node must add up to unity. 
Matrix representation of the decision 
The numerical data for a decision with risk of outcome can also be presented using 
matrices for the payoffs and the probabilities. Table 12.1 below contains the 
information in Figure 12.1. It will be seen that a nil entry applies for action a2 and 
S3. This leads to a zero entry for the probability p23.  Decision trees become 
unwieldy when the numbers of actions and possible outcomes are large, and the 
matrix representation then becomes more useful. The matrix representation will be 
used for decision problems later in this chapter. 
Expected value decision criterion 
To proceed, we observe that the expected value criterion is often used as the 
criterion for decision making when monetary values can be placed on all possible 
outcome. The expected value of an outcome is calculated as its monetary value, 
multiplied by its probability. The expected value of a course of action ai is the sum 
of the expected values of the possible outcomes:

Here V(Oij) is the monetary value of the j-th possible outcome of action ai, and pij is 
the probability of occurrence of Oij when action ai has been taken. Altogether there 
are n possible outcomes for action ai. The expected value criterion chooses the 
action with the highest expected value as the best one. In our example, the expected 
values of the actions are  
 
 
 
Ü§Ü¸(Ü½à¬µ) = 0.6 Ã 14.5 + 0.25 Ã 10.0 + 0.15 Ã (â 20.0) = + $ 8.2 m; 
 
 
Ü§Ü¸(Ü½à¬¶) = 0.4 Ã 5.0 + 0.6 Ã 8.0 = + $ 6.8 m. 
 
These values are shown on the right of Figure 12.1, beside the boxes associated with 
the action. According to the expected value criterion, action a1 is preferred.

This example may seem to be overly idealised and therefore unrealistic. In the 
real situation, there would certainly not be just three or two possible outcomes, but a 
wide range of profits and losses to consider. There would also be more than two 
possible actions. Any number of actions and outcomes can of course be 
accommodated in the expected value calculations, but, as in all engineering 
modelling, idealisation and simplification are appropriate. The use of just three 
possible outcomes for decision a1 approximates a more complex situation. Such 
idealisations should give an acceptably close representation of the real situation. 
This aspect of modelling has been discussed previously in Chapter 2. 
Applicability of the expected value criterion 
The obvious question that arises is: how appropriate is the expected value criterion 
in this particular situation? Or, more generally, under which circumstances is it 
appropriate to use the expected value criterion for decision making?  
 
If the decision is many-off, that is, repeated many times, the expected value of 

Engineering Decision-making 
 
 
 
333
an action will be equal to its long-term return, and it is then highly appropriate to 
choose the action with the highest expected value. The choice of the type of non-
structural cladding panel to be used in the construction of a multi-storey building is 
a many-off decision, in that a very large number of panels will be used, and the 
expected value criterion would be appropriate.  
 
If many one-off decisions with risk have to be made, which are all rather 
similar in nature and with similar ranges of values of outcomes, then the expected 
value criterion will also be appropriate. Here again, the long-term return for the 
class of decisions will be equal to the expected value.  
 
But how appropriate is the expected value criterion for the example in Figure 
12.1? The answer will depend on the size of the construction company and the 
number of similar decisions that are being regularly made. For a large company 
which undertakes comparable work in many cities and regions, the expected value 
criterion will be suitable for reasons already given. On the other hand, if the 
company is small and has limited financial backing, the possible loss of $20m could 
be of real concern, even though the probability of this outcome is relatively low, at 
15 percent. The expected value criterion is not appropriate in this case.  
Risk aversion and risk acceptance 
There are many situations where the expected value criterion will not be appropriate 
and should not be used. In the above example, a loss of $20m, even at a relatively 
low probability, would be unacceptable because it could lead to bankruptcy of the 
company. The expected value criterion is not acceptable because the decision maker 
is averse to risk. Risk aversion usually exists when the stakes are high in 
comparison with the financial resources that are available to the decision maker.  
 
Risk aversion can also be seen in personal decision making, for example when 
a person takes out insurance on a house or car. The expected value here will always 
favour the insurance company (otherwise it would not be in business). Nevertheless, 
the individual willingly pays a premium, which is a small proportion of the cost of 
the house or car, to be assured that replacement or repair will occur in the very 
unlikely event of damage or loss.  
 
Almost the opposite situation can arise when an individual is willing to 
gamble a small amount of money in the hope of making a very large gain, as occurs 
with the purchase of a lottery ticket. This behaviour is called risk acceptance. The 
expected value criterion also advises against such an action, but the near-certain loss 
of a few dollars (the purchase price of the ticket) is acceptable to many people in 
return for the very unlikely chance of winning lots of money.  
 
It is not irrational for risk aversion and risk acceptance to be displayed 
simultaneously by the same person, who is averse to large, unaffordable losses, yet 
finds quite acceptable a small loss with the possibility of a large, but unlikely, win.    
Utility and the utility function 
Risk aversion and risk acceptance can be taken into account using the concept of 
utility, which was first proposed by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern in 
1947 (Neumann & Morgenstern, 1953). A valid decision criterion is obtained by 
setting up an appropriate utility function that suits the personal preferences of the 

Engineering Decision-making 
 
 
 
334
decision maker in regard to risk aversion and risk acceptance. This function 
translates the monetary values of the possible outcomes in the decision situation into 
units of utility. Maximum expected utility then becomes a valid decision criterion 
for choosing the best course of action.  
 
The essential step is the creation of the utility function. It is emphasised that 
this function will be subjective and it will only apply to the decision maker for 
whom it is set up. Also, it will apply only to the decision situation at the time it is 
set up. This is because the decision makerâs attitude can change significantly over 
time, and as external circumstances change.  
 
To set up the utility function, the possible outcomes for the particular decision 
situation are inspected and the most favourable and the least favourable are 
identified and are denoted as O*and O*. Their monetary values are V(O*) and V(O*), 
respectively. An arbitrary range of utility values is chosen. This could for example 
be from 0 to 100 units, or 0 to 10 units, or â100 to +100 units. The highest value of 
utility is allocated to outcome O*, and the lowest value to O*. 
 
A âgameâ for the decision maker is now created. An intermediate outcome is 
chosen, say, Ox, which has a monetary value V(Ox) that lies between V(O*) and 
V(O*). The purpose of the game is to evaluate the utility of Ox, which is denoted as 
U(Ox). The decision tree in Figure 12.2 specifies the game. There are two possible 
courses of action, a1 and a2.  
 
 
 
Figure 12.2 Decision tree for evaluating utilities. 
 
 
Action a1 has two possible outcomes, O* and O*, with values V(O*) and V(O*) and 
allocated utilities U(O*) and U(O*). The associated probabilities, px and (1 â px), are 
initially unknown. Action a2 has only one possible (and therefore certain) outcome, 
which is Ox with the value V(Ox). The decision maker is asked to consider the 
decision and choose the specific value px, such that decisions a1 and a2 become 
equally acceptable. The decision maker can try out several values of px in turn. For 
the extreme values, we can see that px = 1 leads to the choice of action a1, but px = 0 
will result in a2 being preferred. At some intermediate value, px, the actions a1 and 
a2 become equally acceptable, and a1 and a2 then have the same value of utility, 
Ü·(Ü½à¬µ) =  Ü·(Ü½à¬¶). The utility of Ox is obtained as:  
 
Ü·(Ü±à¯«) = Ýà¯« Ü·(Ü±â) + àµ«1 â Ýà¯«àµ¯Ü·(Ü±â)

The game is replayed using differing outcomes Ox so that a functional relation 
between utility and dollar value is created. A numerical example is provided 
below. 
Expected utility as decision criterion 
The utility function is an appropriate criterion for decision making under risk for the 
case where the decision is one-off. This is because the transformation of dollar 
value into utility units and the use of the utility measure of value allows for the 
attitude of the decision maker to risk, including both risk aversion and risk 
acceptance. The expected utility for an action ai is

(12.3) 
 
 
 
 
If decisions are being made on behalf of a corporation or an organisation or a 
business, an individual or a small group of people can be chosen to represent the 
best interests of the organisation in order to set up the appropriate utility function. 
 
With the expected values of the outcomes replaced by expected utility values, 
the decision tree can be modified to treat utilities rather than dollar values. The 
utility criterion can be used in other decision situations, and will be discussed again 
in later sections of this chapter.  
Numerical example using the utility criterion 
A re-analysis of the problem of Figure 12.1 will illustrate the method. We choose a 
range of utilities between + 20 and â 20, so that the upper and lower values are 
 
 
O*= O11; V(O*) = + $14.5m; U(O*) = + 20 
 
O* = O13; V(O*) = â $20.0m; U(O*) = â 20 
 
We now consider several intermediate outcomes, the first being V(Ox) = + $10m. To 
obtain equal value for actions a2 and a1, where a2 leads to a certain gain of +$10m, 
the decision maker representing the small firm would require a very high value of 
px, because a loss of â$20m could be disastrous. A value of px = 0.98 is chosen. The 
corresponding utility value is then: 
 
 
U(V(Ox) = + $ 10m) = 0.98 x 20 + (1 â 0.98) x (-20) = 19.2 
 
 
The next values we choose for Ox are zero and â$10m, which yield lower values of 
px, say 0.85 and 0.6, respectively. Any number of additional intermediate values can 
be used. The resulting relation between utility and dollar value (in millions of 
dollars) is shown in Figure 12.3. From Figure 12.3 we can read off the utility 
values:  
 
U(O11) = U(+$14.5m) = + 20 
 
U(O12) = U(+$10.0m) = + 19 
 
U(O13) = U(- $20.0m) = â 20 
 
U(O21) = U(+ $ 5.0m) =  + 17 
 
U(O22) = U(+ $ 8.0m) =  + 18

Figure 12.3 Utility function for example. 
 
 
From these utility values we calculate the expected utilities for a1 and a2: 
 
 
U(a1) =  0.6 Ã 20 + 0.25 Ã 19 + 0.15 Ã (- 20.0) = + 13. 75 
 
U(a2) =  0.4 Ã 17 + 0.6 Ã 18 = + 17.6  
 
The preferred decision now, allowing for risk aversion, is clearly a2, which is, 
intuitively, the better one. A decision tree representation of the problem, with 
utilities in lieu of dollar values, is shown in Figure 12.4. 
 
 
 
Figure 12.4 Decision tree with utilities instead of monetary value. 
 
To summarise: It is appropriate to use the expected value criterion for many-off 
decisions with risk of outcome. It can also be used when many different but similar 
decisions are to be made, in which the ranges of outcomes are comparable. In one-
off decisions, the expected utility criterion should be used whenever the decision 
maker shows risk aversion or risk acceptance.

12.3 MULTI-STAGE DECISIONS WITH RISK OF OUTCOME  
In each step of a multi-stage decision sequence, the decision can depend on the 
outcomes of previous decisions. The procedure for analysing a multi-stage decision 
process follows from the observation that, irrespective of any prior decisions and 
outcomes, the best course of action to follow at any particular stage is to maximise 
the total payoff for the future steps. This idea leads to a last-first strategy which is 
also used to solve sequential optimisation problems, as will be seen in Chapter 13.  
 
The strategy is illustrated with the following example. In planning for an 
upgrade to the water supply for a developing outer city region, the changes that 
occur over two time periods are being evaluated. In the first time period, there are 
two options: to install either a small capacity pipeline (action a11) or a large capacity 
pipeline (action a12). In modelling the problem, two possible outcomes (or states of 
nature) are considered for the first time period: either there is low demand or high 
demand for water. In the second time period, action a11 is followed up with a 
second-stage decision, namely to do nothing (a21) or to construct a second parallel 
pipeline to increase capacity (a22). This second decision is again followed by two 
possible states of nature, or outcomes: low or high demand. The second stage of the 
process involving a21 could well be followed by further stages, but to keep the 
example simple we consider just a two-stage process. There is no second-stage 
action if the first-stage decision is to install a large-capacity pipeline (a12).  
 
Figure 12.5 shows the decision tree for this example, where, as previously, a 
small square box represents a decision node, with possible decisions represented by 
lines emanating from the box and ending in small circular outcome nodes. The 
possible outcomes following a decision are represented by lines emanating from the 
circular node at the end of the action line. The dollar costs, shown in the boxes at 
the tips of the branches on the right side of Figure 12.5, take account of lost 
opportunity, as for example when the decision to install a large pipeline is followed 
by low usage.  
 
In the first stage of the process the probabilities of the states of nature are 0.4 
and 0.6 for low demand and high demand, respectively. However, in the second 
stage, the probabilities are 0.2 and 0.8 for low demand and high demand, in the case 
where high demand has previously been experienced in the first stage. In the case of 
low demand in the first stage, the second-stage probabilities are 0.7 for low demand 
and 0.3 for high demand.  
 
The calculations are carried out in terms of costs, the negative signs are 
dropped, so that the criterion is now to minimise cost. The dollar signs are also 
omitted. To apply the last-first strategy, we consider the final stage of the process 
and examine the outcomes at the boxes in turn. The expected value of each possible 
outcome is determined from the value entered in its box and the associated 
probability. Working our way from right to left, i.e., backward in time, we start at 
node 3, where the expected cost is 0.7 x (70) + 0.3 x (325) = 146.5. The expected 
value at node 4 is 0.7 x (365) + 0.3 x (325) = 353. 
 
Moving back to decision node B, where the expected value of each course of 
action is obtained by summing the expected values of the possible outcomes, we see 
that action a21 is preferred. We write the expected value 146.5 at the node and use 
an arrow on the a21 branch to indicate that this is the preferred action at this point. 
 
The expected costs at outcome nodes 3 to 8 are shown in Figure 12.5. At 

Engineering Decision-making 
 
 
 
338
decision node C, the expected cost is equal to that for the preferred action a2l, i.e. 
316 from action node 5. Working our way from right to left, we now reach action 
node 1, where the expected cost is obtained from those at B and C as 0.4 x (146.5) + 
0.6 x (316) = 248.2. This is the expected value of action a11.  
 
Figure 12.5 A multi-stage decision for a water supply expansion project. 
 
  
In this way we can move back, stage by stage and repeat the evaluations. As there is 
no second action to follow a12, the expected cost at node 2 is the weighted sum of 
the values at nodes 7 and 8: 0.4 x (218) + 0.6 x (158) = 182, which is the lower cost 
for the two possible actions, so that a12 is preferred. The preferred action, a12, is to 
install the large pipe.  
 
When the decision process has been analysed by this last-step-first procedure, 
the appropriate courses of action are obtained at every stage of the process, 
irrespective of the previous decisions and previous outcomes. If for example action 
a11 had initially been chosen, despite the outcome of the analysis, the appropriate 
course of action in the second stage is shown in the decision tree. The best actions at 
every stage of the process are indicated by the arrows leaving the (square) decision 
nodes.

In Figure 12.5 it will be noted that two different actions have been denoted as 
a21, and another two actions have likewise been denoted as a22. Here there is little 
chance of ambiguity as the like-named actions emanate from different decision 
nodes (B and C). In a more complex, multi-stage problem the actions can be given a 
marker to identify the decision node, as for example aB
21 and aC
21. Multi-stage 
decision processes can clearly arise for which the decision tree becomes a very 
complex network.  
 
If the multi-stage process has certainty of outcome, there are network 
optimisation procedures, such as linear programming and dynamic programming, 
that can be used to obtain a solution. They use the last-first approach as described 
here. Chapter 13 deals with such procedures, although not specifically in relation to 
decision analysis. 
 
We have used expected value for our decision criterion in this example. This 
type of problem would be handled by a government authority or a large 
organisation. Multi-stage decision problems may also involve possible significant 
adverse financial results. It would then be appropriate to set up a utility function as 
explained previously in Section 12.3 and apply the expected utility criterion.  
 
12.4 DECISION MAKING WITH CERTAINTY OF OUTCOME 
Some engineering decisions are carried out in situations where a great deal of 
relevant background information is available, and the decisions concern a 
deterministic system. In planning a space mission, NASA engineers need to choose 
a launch time such that the planets and moons are suitably positioned to optimise 
travel time and minimise fuel loads. In the case of a mission to Mars, a suitable 
launch window of a month or two comes up every two years (Squyres, 2005). The 
choice of launch time is based on full knowledge of the relative locations of the 
celestial bodies (which are calculated accurately using Newtonâs laws of motion). 
Provided the appropriate decision criterion has been clearly stated, the decision 
follows from the necessary computations. 
 
Even when there is full knowledge of the consequences of each possible 
course of action, engineering decisions must be based on suitable criteria that allow 
the alternative possible actions to be evaluated, compared and ranked. A 
complicating factor will often be that there is not just one objective to be achieved 
or optimised, but several or even many. The case of multi-criteria decision making 
is discussed below in Section 12.7.  
 
12.5 DECISION MAKING WITH UNCERTAINTY OF OUTCOME 
In some situations there may not be sufficient information available for the decision 
maker to determine the probability of occurrence of the outcomes. Various methods 
have been proposed for dealing with this uncertainty situation.  
 
To discuss these, we will use an example in which engineers must choose the 
water level to keep in a dam. The problem is simplified to the following. There are 
two options to be evaluated: one (action a1) is to keep the level deliberately low in 
the hope that good rains will come and fill the dam; the other is to choose a more 

Engineering Decision-making 
 
 
 
340
conservative action (a2), and maintain a medium-high level. From previous records, 
it is estimated that keeping the level low would lead to a good payoff, of 100 units, 
if good rains come, but a poor outcome of 20 units if there is little rain. The 
conservative approach a2 has a lower payoff in the event of good rains (50 utility 
units) but a reasonable payoff with poor rain (40 units). 
 
We will consider this problem with unknown probabilities, but for comparison 
purposes we first look at the decision process if the probabilities are known, and are 
as given in Figure 12.6. With a 20 percent chance of good rains and an 80 percent 
chance of poor rains, the expected utilities for actions a1 and a2 are: EU(a1) = 36 and 
EU(a2) = 42, so that the decision to be taken would be a2.  
 
 
 
Figure 12.6 A decision tree with utilities and two possible courses of action, a1 and a2. 
Laplaceâs principle 
According to Laplaceâs principle (actually first described by Bernoulli), all 
outcomes are assumed to be equally likely in the case that the probabilities are 
unknown. The decision tree then becomes as in Figure 12.7. The preferred decision 
is now a1 since it has the higher expected outcome (60 compared with 45). 
Laplaceâs principle provides a means for making decisions, but it can lead to poor 
decisions because it gives equal weighting to all possible outcomes, even ones that 
are considered very unlikely. 
Pessimistic criterion 
If the probabilities are unknown, one could assume the worst and minimise the 
potential losses. The choice will then be determined by the course of action that has 
the least-worst outcome. From Figure 12.7 we see that action a2 would be selected 
because its worst outcome is better than for action a1 (40 compared to 20).

Bennett (2001) has pointed out that the precautionary principle in 
environmental theory is equivalent to decision making under uncertainty, and using 
the pessimistic principle. When decisions are made under competition (to be treated 
below in Section 12.7), a pessimistic approach is quite reasonable, because your 
opponent is malevolent, and this âminimaxâ strategy minimises the maximum 
damage your opponent can do (Holland, 1998). Looking from the point of view of 
making profits rather than suffering losses, ReVelle et al. (2004) refer to this as a 
âmaxi-minâ strategy where the aim is to maximise the minimum payout. 
Optimistic criterion 
In contrast to the pessimistic criterion, an optimistic approach would seek the best 
possible outcome, and maximise the maximum payout. According to Manhart 
(2005), humans in general have an optimistic bias in their decision making, 
particularly when it comes to personal preferences, but this will not assist them in a 
situation where an engineering decision is being made. In the example, a1 would be 
preferred as it has the better outcome (100 compared to 50). This approach can lead 
to poor outcomes, and cannot be justified for engineering decisions.  
Minimised regret criterion 
Another approach is to minimise the regret that a decision can bring. This requires 
slightly more sophisticated thinking, and is a valid way to make decisions. Regret is 
taken to be the difference between the payoff for the chosen decision and the payoff 
for the best possible decision associated with the revealed state of nature. The 
decision tree for our example has been redrawn in Figure 12.8, where the 
consequences of two possible natural events, n1 and n2,  are shown.

 Figure 12.8 The decision tree redrawn with actions a1 and a2 and two possible states of nature n1 and n2 
at unknown probabilities. The outcomes are unchanged. 
 
 
We first consider the situation if n1 occurs. Had action a1 been selected, the decision 
maker would have no regrets since the chosen action gives the best result for n1 (100 
compared to 50). However, had action a2 been chosen, the regret would be 50 units 
of utility because the best possible result with natural event n1 is 100. For the second 
outcome, n2, the regret would be 20 if action a1 had been chosen, and no regret if a2 
had been chosen. These results are summarised in Table 12.2, where the regret, in 
utility units, is given for each action and outcome. To minimise maximum regret, 
action a1 would be chosen.

Subjective probabilities 
If the probabilities are not known, the decision maker may wish to estimate them, 
using intuition and experience. This is a relatively simple procedure, but the results 
will clearly depend on the judgement and previous experience of the decision 
maker, and on how often similar situations have arisen in the past.   
 
However, caution needs to be exercised if data are evaluated prior to choosing 
the probabilities. Winman et al. (2004) have suggested that answers to questions on 
probability values can depend on the way the question is framed. The decision 
maker might be asked to âestimate the lower and upper range of values for the 
probability of such-and-such occurringâ. Alternatively, the question might be âwhat 
are the chances that the probability of such-and-such occurring will be between x 
and y?â Both questions seem to be asking much the same question, but, by asking it 
in different ways, not only are different estimates usually given, but the confidence

associated with the answer is quite different. As a matter of interest, the latter 
question was found to yield better answers than the former.  
Unstructured uncertainty 
When the decision maker does not even know the possible outcomes of the possible 
actions, the only responsible course of action is to defer the decision and obtain 
additional information. Buying information is discussed in Section 12.8 below.  
12.6 GAME THEORY AND DECISION MAKING WITH COMPETITION 
In August 1955, a decision was taken in Moscow to put a satellite into orbit around 
the earth before July 1, 1957. According to Schefter (2000) â[the] timing had only 
one purpose: to beat the United States of America into spaceâ. In the end, delays 
meant that it was not until October 1957 that the task was accomplished, but the aim 
had been achieved: the Americans had been beaten.  
 
Engineering is often undertaken in a competitive environment. Jobs can be 
won or lost in a tendering system where an organisation describes the work it wants 
done in a call for tenders, and competing firms then bid for the opportunity to 
undertake the work. The bidding process is confidential, and each firm bids without 
information about the potential rival bids. The aim of each firm is to put in the most 
attractive bid and to be selected on the basis of cost. The organisation must of 
course be confident that the successful bidding firm is competent to undertake the 
work and that the bid is realistic.  
 
When an engineering firm prepares a tender, it knows it is in competition with 
other firms, and that the chance of success depends in part on how their competitors 
act. This complicates the decision-making process. In preparing the bid, the firm 
will want to choose a dollar value as high as is reasonable to maximise profit; 
however, it knows that too high a bid will mean that another firm will put in a lower 
offer and win the tender, in which case there is no profit at all. On the other hand, if 
the successful bid is too low, the firm will lose money on the contract. 
 
In effect, each firm goes through a two-stage decision process. In the first 
stage, there are two options: either to bid, or not to bid. If the decision is taken to 
bid, then the second stage becomes, in a simplified model, a choice among three 
options: bid high, bid low at a level that will do little more than cover costs, or bid 
in the intermediate range. In this situation, the outcome will depend on the actions 
of all the competitors and is therefore quite different to the situations treated 
previously using a decision tree.  
 
Game theory is a branch of applied mathematics that deals with competitive 
decision making. In principle, the concepts apply to many competitive human 
situations such as that occur in games of strategy, business, economic behaviour, 
and warfare. Although real-world situations are often too complex to allow direct 
application of gaming models, a good insight into decision making in the face of 
competition can be gained from a study of the elements of game theory. We will 
look at some elementary aspects of the theory.  
 
It is useful to distinguish between strategic and non-strategic games. Non-
strategic games do not depend on the skills of the players, and do not require 
intelligent decisions to be made. The outcomes depend purely on chance and can be 

Engineering Decision-making 
 
 
 
344
analysed using probability and statistics. Examples of non-strategic games include 
board games such as snakes and ladders (where the outcomes depend on the chance 
throw of dice), and betting on the outcome of a tossed coin or die.  
 
 
John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern: the zero sum game 
 
The foundations for game theory were set out in the book âThe Theory of Games 
and Economic Behaviorâ by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern in 1944. 
There was a fundamental breakthrough when von Neumann showed that, for a 
specific game, the two-person zero-sum game, a strategy was possible to 
maximise rewards. That strategy was based on each player maximising his or 
her minimum payoff.  
In a zero-sum game, one personâs loss is another personâs gain, and all 
payoffs sum to zero for all possible strategies. Poker, for example, when played 
by two players is a zero-sum game. Add another player, or a banker who takes a 
cut of the pot, and it is no longer a two-person zero-sum game. The tendering 
process, even when undertaken with only two firms tendering, cannot be treated 
as a zero-sum game, since the loser must cover the cost of putting together the 
tender bid, whereas the winner will presumably profit from undertaking the job. 
These two sums are quite different.  
 
 
 
A strategic game involves two or more players who act rationally to promote 
their own interests. Provided there is no cooperation among the players, it is a non-
cooperative game. The outcome of the game depends on the decisions of the 
players, but chance might also play a part in determining the outcome, which 
involves some players âwinningâ and, usually, the other players âlosingâ. A zero-
sum game is one in which the sum of the winnings for all players is equal to the sum 
of their losses.  
 
A simple one-stage decision with risk of outcome, such as the one represented 
by Table 12.1 in Section 12.2, can be thought of as a primitive example of a two-
person game. Here, the opponent of the decision maker is Nature. In a âplayâ, the 
decision maker chooses one of the available courses of action, and the response is 
one of two possible states of nature. The two moves together determine the outcome 
of the play, which will be a win or loss for the decision maker (or âplayerâ). Of 
course, Nature here tends to be a disinterested player, rather than a competitive or 
malevolent one.  
Two-person, zero-sum games 
In a two-person, zero-sum game, players A and B each have a range of possible 
moves, a1, .. ai, .. am, and b1, .. bj, .. bn. In a âplayâ A and B each choose a move, not 
knowing at the time what the opponentâs move will be. Each possible pair of moves 
that make up a play, ai and bj, has an outcome Oij, which by convention involves a 
payoff of value uij from B to A. A negative payoff means that B wins from A. The 
game can be represented by a payoff matrix that covers all possible outcomes.  
 
By way of example, Table 12.3(a) contains the payoff matrix for a simple 
two-person, zero-sum game. In this case, A and B both have three possible moves. 
It will be clear from Table 12.3(a) that the game is unfair to B, but gaming 
situations are often not âfairâ. We wish to find out how to determine the best 

Engineering Decision-making 
 
 
 
345
possible strategies for each player, assuming they do not cooperate and that they 
will make rational choices.

We first consider how A might reason. Aâs first thought could be to maximise 
the payoff, and hence choose action a3 with the result +13. This strategy of 
maximising the possible outcome is expressed as: 
 
maxà¯à¯àµ«Ýà¯à¯àµ¯= Ý32 = + 13 
 
However, recognising that B is intelligent and is unlikely to choose action b2, A will 
conclude that it is not feasible to achieve the maximum possible payoff. A 
reasonable alternative for A would be to determine the minimum payoff from the 
options a1, a2 and a3, and then choose the move (here a2) which maximises the 
minimum payoff. This is shown in Figure 12.3(b). The strategy of maximising the 
minimum payoff is expressed as: 

Engineering Decision-making 
 
 
 
346
maxà¯àµ£minà¯àµ«Ýà¯à¯àµ¯àµ§= +1  (Ý= 2; Ý= 1) 
 
 
From Bâs viewpoint, the initial approach might be to minimise the payoff to 
A, and choose action b3 with the strategy 
 
minà¯à¯àµ«Ýà¯à¯àµ¯= â3 
 
But A is intelligent and will avoid choosing a1, and B must be satisfied with less 
than the best possible outcome and seek an alternative approach. As with A, B is 
left with the strategy of identifying the maximum payoff from each move, b1, b2 and 
b3, but minimising the maximum payoff, as in Figure 12.3(c). This gives 
 
minà¯àµ£maxà¯(Ýà¯à¯)àµ§= +1  (Ý= 1;Ý= 2) 
 
 
In this game, the outcome O21 is the most satisfactory result for both A and B. 
This is said to be a saddle point, for which 
 
minà¯àµ£maxà¯àµ«Ýà¯à¯àµ¯àµ§= maxà¯àµ£minà¯àµ«Ýà¯à¯àµ¯àµ§ 
 
and the value of the game is, u21 = +1. Even if the game were to be played 
repeatedly, there would be no advantage for A or B to use moves other than those 
already identified. A sudden change in strategy would lead to a worse outcome for 
both players. The decision criteria are therefore: 
 
 
 
 
For A: maximise the minimum payoff 
 
 
 
For B: minimise the maximum payoff 
 
Here, the criteria lead to a single best move for both players, which are, for A 
always to choose action a2, and for B always to choose action b1.  
 
This first example was very simple. Not all games will have a saddle point. 
The payoff matrix for another game is given in Table 12.4 below.  Here we obtain: 
 
   maxà¯àµ£minà¯(Ýà¯à¯)àµ§= +2   (Ý= 1, Ý= 1) 
minà¯àµ£maxà¯àµ«Ýà¯à¯àµ¯àµ§= +3     (Ý= 1, Ý= 2) 
 
If this game is to be played just once, it is not clear which are the best moves for A 
and B. To maximise the minimum payoff, A would play a1, while to minimise the 
maximum payoff, B would play b1. However, in the expectation that B will play b1, 
A might be tempted to play a2, and hence increase the payoff to +3. But this would 
run the risk of the payoff falling to â 5, depending on what B chooses to do. 
Likewise, in trying to double-guess A, B might be tempted to play b2, with a 
possible payoff of â 5 (a win for B), but also with the risk of the payoff rising to +5. 
 
If the game is to be played many times, A can use a mixed strategy by playing 
a2 occasionally to improve the overall payoff. B can also play b2 occasionally to 
reduce the payoff. A mixed strategy can be found for each player, which involves 
playing each move a definite proportion of the time, but in a random and, from the 

Engineering Decision-making 
 
 
 
347
opponentâs viewpoint, unpredictable manner. The strategy for A is represented by 
probabilities p and (1 - p), which are the relative frequencies of choosing a1 and a2. 
For B, the strategy is q and (1 - q). It is possible to evaluate optimal mixed strategies 
for such games, based on the criterion for A of maximising the minimum expected 
payoff, and for B of minimising the maximum expected payoff.

If there were contact between the two players, bluffing could be attempted by 
either or both, to mislead the opponent about upcoming plays. Cooperation could 
also be considered. This adds further dimensions to the game. Although we will not 
go into the details of evaluating strategies here, it should be noted that analyses can 
also be carried out for large ÝÃ Ý games and that the analyses have very close 
parallels with linear programming (Taha, 2017).  
Other types of games 
So far, we have only looked at zero-sum games, which are not applicable to many 
real engineering decision situations. Other forms of games have been studied and 
developments continue to be made in this relatively new branch of applied 
mathematics.  
 
Extension of the two-person zero-sum game can be to a three-person game 
and to a multi-person game. With more players taking part in a game that is 
repeated, it becomes possible for two or more players to form a coalition, and act 
jointly against the other players. In a three-person game, A and B might join forces, 
temporarily, to win from C. A strategy for C is then to try to break the coalition and 
form a different coalition, say with A. This is possible because the best strategy for 
A will not necessarily be to remain in a coalition with B. If the coalition has been 
successful so far and C has incurred losses, there may well be a good opportunity 
for A for further winnings by breaking the alliance with B and taking C as an ally.

In non-zero-sum games, the losses are not necessarily equal to the gains in a 
play. In Table 12.5 the payoff table for a simple non-zero sum, two-person game is 
shown. The double entry for each outcome shows the payoffs to A and to B, 
respectively.

(â 1, â 1)
 
Some of the outcomes in the table have zero sums. For example, if A plays a1 and B 
plays b1, the outcome is a loss of one unit by A and a gain of one unit by B. 
However, some outcomes result in wins for both players, with joint plays (a1, b3) 
and (a2, b2) being examples. These are win-win situations. On the other hand, (a3, 
b3) and (a2, b3) lead to losses for both players. This form of game can be difficult to 
deal with mathematically. 
Further strategies 
Rational strategies are available for various types of games, but we will consider 
just several. In some games, one course of action for a player will be better than all 
the others, no matter what the competitor chooses to do. This is called a strictly 
dominant strategy. If a course of action is equal to, or better than, any other, it is a 
dominant strategy. In game theory, a rational player will always choose a strictly 
dominant or dominant strategy, if one exists.  
 
As an example, we consider the game with the payoff matrix given in Table 
12.6. Although the double entry convention for non-zero-sum games has been used, 
this is a zero-sum game because the sum of the payoffs to the players happens to be 
zero for every entry.

Looking first at Bâs options, action b2 will not be chosen by a rational player 
because it is dominated by both b1 and b3. No matter what Player A does, Player B 
will be worse off choosing b2, with payoffs for B of â4, â2 or â13. By choosing 
b1, Player B, would improve the payoffs to +1, â1 or +2. Option b2 can therefore 
be removed from the game, and the payoff table is now as in Table 12.7.

Turning now to Player A, it is evident that option a1 is strictly dominated by a2 and 
should be removed. This leaves the payoff table shown in Table 12.8. For Player B, 
option b1 is seen to be strictly dominant: (â1 > â2 and 2 > â1). Knowing this, 
Player A will choose a2. The solution for this game is therefore (a2, b1). The 
procedure of sequentially removing lesser options has led to the name iterated 
dominant strategy.

Nash Equilibrium 
The payoff matrix for another non-cooperative, two-person game is shown in Table 
12.9, below. There are no dominant or dominated strategies for either player. This is 
an example of the type of game studied by John Nash, who shared the Nobel Prize 
for economics in 1994 (actually, the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in 
Memory of Alfred Nobel).

In studying such games, Nash realised that a player cannot consider his or her 
options in isolation. To take account of competition, each player needs to think 
through all the options in turn, including those of the opponent. A player might then 
be able to identify his or her best strategy for each possible play of the opponent.   
 
In our example: If Player B(etty) assumes Player A(ndrew) will select a1, then 
she should choose b1 (as this has the higher payoff); on the other hand, if A assumes 
B will play b1, then he should choose a1. In this particular instance, there is 
agreement between the players, and the joint strategy (a1, b1) is denoted as a Nash 
equilibrium point. A similar analysis shows that there is a second equilibrium point 
at (a2, b2).

Prisonerâs dilemma 
 
A classic problem in the early theory of games is a situation described as the 
prisonerâs dilemma. The scenario is that two long-time thieves have been caught 
near the scene of a burglary. They have been taken to the local police station 
and are being interviewed separately. Each is told that if he confesses to the 
pairâs guilt and his partner does not, then he will be given protection and escape 
jail, while his partner will get 20 years in jail. If both confess, they have been told 
that they will be treated leniently and get 10 years of jail. The thieves know that if 
neither confesses, then the worst that is likely to happen is that they will get 1 
year in jail because there is little evidence on which to convict them. What should 
each man do?  
There is certainly an argument for not confessing because that gives a 
good outcome, but only if the other does not too. In developing a solution, the 
first task is to represent the range of outcomes as a payoff matrix, like the one in 
Table 12.8. Note that it is not a zero-sum game since the sum of each of the 
outcomes at each of the four possible strategies does not sum to zero. Indeed, 
none of them sum to zero. Table 12.10 presents all the options and the payoffs 
in terms of years in jail. In this case, therefore, the smaller the payoff the better 
the option. 
 
Table 12.10 Payoff table for the prisonerâs dilemma. Note: payoff is (Payoff to A, Payoff to B) 
 
 
 
Prisoner B 
 
 
confess 
silent 
Prisoner A 
confess 
(10,10) 
(0,20) 
 
silent 
(20,  0) 
(1,  1) 
 
To determine the most likely outcome, it is necessary to investigate the 
various options. Consider first Prisoner A. He considers his options in the light of 
the behaviour of Prisoner B. If Prisoner B confesses, then A will either get 10 
years if he also confesses or 20 years if he does not. Therefore, in that situation 
he should confess. On the other hand, if Prisoner B stays silent, A will either get 
0 years if he confesses or 1 year if he stays silent too. In that case he should 
confess. Therefore, no matter what B does A should confess. Prisoner B can go 
through the same process and arrive at the same conclusion. Therefore, rational 
prisoners would both confess and get 10 years in jail. This is not the best 
outcome for them, but if they are acting rationally and are unable to confer, this is 
the action they would choose. There are a range of extensions to the sorts of 
games that can be contemplated. The concept of cooperative and non-
cooperative games adds another level of complexity. For the treatment here, 
cooperative games will not be considered. 
The argument used to come to a final rational decision with the prisonerâs 
dilemma can be formalised by the definition of a number of strategies: of 
dominant, strictly dominant, dominated and strictly dominated, which are 
described briefly in the main text. These allow a formal approach to be taken to 
the problem of making decisions with competition. 
 
 
In general, there may not be a Nash equilibrium point in a game, alternatively 
there may be one or more. Strategically, it is not in any playerâs interest to 
unilaterally change away from a Nash equilibrium point, and so strategies for non-

Engineering Decision-making 
 
 
 
351
cooperative games can be developed from the Nash equilibrium concept. Since 
Nashâs work, there have been significant further developments in game theory.  
 
In this brief review, we have only discussed simple, basic concepts. From a 
practical viewpoint, it is also possible to find near-optimal strategies by brute-force 
computations using search, trial-and-error, and simulation, as will be explained in 
Chapter 13.  
12.7 MULTIPLE-CRITERIA DECISIONS WITH MANY PARTICIPANTS  
The decision models so far considered have used a single decision criterion, which 
was either dollar payoff or utility. Many real engineering decision problems are 
more complex, in that there are many separate criteria to be considered 
simultaneously. Personal decision problems can also be of this type. Consider for 
example the purchase of an automobile. The prime consideration might be initial 
cost, but there are other relevant matters to consider, including the ongoing costs for 
service and repair, the safety and performance of the vehicle on the road, fuel 
economy, emissions levels, driver and passenger comfort, electronic aids (radio, 
music player, navigation aids and parking assistance), internal and external styling 
and possibly even colour.    
 
Also, multi-criteria problems can be classified according to the amount of 
information available to the decision maker, and so the range of possibilities 
includes certainty, risk, uncertainty and ignorance of outcome. These may be in 
one-off or many-off situations, and in competitive, game-like situations.  
 
A further complication occurs if the participants in the decision process are 
numerous. Large engineering projects involve decisions that affect the lives of many 
people and organisations. Some at least of those affected will consider themselves 
to be stakeholders and will want to take part in the decision-making.  
 
Multi-criteria and multi-participant decision problems arise in large 
engineering, public-benefit projects. In the management of water resources, some of 
the important criteria include maximising flood prevention (or at least providing 
flood control), maintaining a continuous supply of water for irrigation and 
household use, and accommodating water sports and other recreational activities.   
 
It is rarely possible to find optimal solutions to such complex decision 
problems. However, a pragmatic approach is to find a âgoodâ result, rather than the 
best. Researchers have studied multi-criteria and multi-participant decision 
problems since (at least) the 1970s, and various approaches have been proposed. We 
will shortly consider several that have been used successfully to effect community 
decision making. It needs to be said, however, that multiple-participant problems 
can in some circumstances become very difficult to deal with, particularly when the 
participants have differing and strongly held, entrenched views and agendas. The 
problem can then become âwickedâ, and in extreme circumstances, a âmessâ, as 
discussed previously in Chapter 3. If it is not possible to find an engineering 
solution, then a political solution can be attempted.  
Satisficing with multiple criteria 
In some situations, one decision criterion will be more important than the others. A 
simple and practical approach is then to use the main decision criterion to compare 

Engineering Decision-making 
 
 
 
352
and rank the alternatives, but to set minimum acceptable levels for the other criteria. 
This approach has been called satisficing. Any contemplated course of action is then 
eliminated or modified if it does not meet all of the minimum acceptance levels. 
The remaining feasible actions can then be evaluated and ranked according to the 
main criterion.  
 
If a new computer facility is to be chosen by design consultants, there will be 
numerous criteria to consider. Initial cost will be important, but ongoing costs, 
reliability, availability and compatibility of software, expertise and practical help in 
the event of system failure, average downtime for the different units such as printers 
and work stations, response time for callouts, are all important factors. Information 
on these aspects should be obtainable from the distributors of the competing 
systems in the market, and it would then be possible to set realistic minimum 
requirements for each criterion. A satisficing approach can now be used, with 
present dollar value as the prime criterion, but with minimum acceptance standards 
for other factors, such as: 
service time to be within three hours of call during office hours for any piece of 
equipment; and 
total downtime to be not more than five percent. 
 
Traditional engineering design procedures are often based on what is, in 
effect, a satisficing approach. In routine structural design, various criteria must be 
taken into account when, say, reinforced concrete beams and slabs are proportioned. 
The design criteria include adequate serviceability, adequate safety against failure, 
ease of construction, robustness, initial cost and ongoing maintenance costs. 
National design standards impose strict legal minimum requirements on many of the 
structural factors related to these criteria, for example by placing upper allowable 
limits on deflections and crack widths to ensure serviceability, and minimum 
acceptable strength levels for different possible modes of failure to ensure safety. 
With such limits, the designer can optimise the design by minimising cost over the 
full life cycle, while confirming that all relevant limits on structural behaviour are 
met.  
 
An advantage of the satisficing approach, if it can be used, is that it is simple 
to apply. On the other hand, it will not necessarily deliver the best possible solution. 
In fact, the method avoids addressing the question of what constitutes the best 
solution. Nevertheless, it can deliver a range of good, workable solutions for 
relatively complex decision problems.  
Weighting and scoring multiple criteria 
As an alternative to the satisficing approach, a weighting-and-scoring technique 
might be used. Each course of action, ai, is studied in turn, together with the 
possible outcomes associated with it. A score, sij, (for example out of 10) is 
allocated for each criterion, cj. Weights, wj, are also given to each criterion to reflect 
its relative importance. An overall score can then be calculated for each possible 
course of action, taking all criteria and possible outcomes into account. This allows 
a ranking to be made. With n criteria to be considered, the score for the ith course of 
action is

This technique is suitable for evaluating and ranking bids for tenders. An example 
of a bid evaluation is summarised in Table 12.11.

The tender was for the architectural design and documentation of a university 
building. The tenderers had been advised of the criteria to be used for evaluation, 
which were: fixed lump fee; design methodology; resources available to undertake 
the work; availability of consultants; previous project experience and educational 
qualifications; and previous experience in the management of building contractors.  
 
The evaluations of the submissions from four companies, listed as A, B, C and 
D, are presented in Table 12.11, using two columns for each company. The first 
column shows the raw scores given for each criterion; the second column gives the 
weighted scores. The total sums of the weighted scores are entered in the second to 
last row. The rankings of the companies, based on the weighted scores, are in the 
last row of the table. The weightings given to each of the criteria are shown in the 
second column in the table. The range of scores were: 0: not submitted; 1 â 2: poor; 
3: reasonable; 4 â 5: good; 6 â 7: above average; 8 â 9: excellent; 10: exceeds 
request. 
 
The weighting and scoring technique has various advantages. Firstly, it is 
useful to have a method that gives a quantitative answer when the alternatives are 
compared. Secondly, in the planning stage it forces the user to consider the 
performance of the options and this assists in that process. Thirdly, the method can 
be applied at different stages of the design and planning processes.  
 
However, Hobbs (1980) has suggested that a proper set of weights must have 
certain characteristics if it is to take proper account of trade-offs among the criteria. 
The weights need to be proportional to the relative value of unit changes in their 
objective functions. This means that weights should not be given simple ordinal 
values such as 1 for low importance, 2 for average importance and 3 for high 
importance. This does not allow for trade-offs among the criteria. For example, if w1 
= 2 and w2 = 4, then an increase in the score of objective 1 by 1 unit should be 
viewed as identical in overall benefit to a change in value of objective 2 by 0.5 
units. The weights are much more about relative trade-off values than importance.  
 
The process of determining weights may take some time but as Hobbs notes: 
âAs a typical siting study [for power plants in the U.S.] costs tens of millions of 

Engineering Decision-making 
 
 
 
354
dollars or more, it seems reasonable to require that an extra afternoon be taken to 
ensure that weights are theoretically valid.â  
 
 
Power supply for Baden-WÅ±rttemberg 
 
Renn (2003) shows the application of a weighting and scoring technique in a 
survey that was carried out in Germany to provide power supply planning data 
for the medium to long term. Four scenarios were developed: 
1. 
Utilization of technologies (nuclear power); 
2. 
Protection of resources (sustainable, conservation); 
3. 
New lifestyle (green, change in lifestyle); and 
4. 
Business as usual. 
 
Two groups of people (a group of engineers and a group of church 
representatives) were then surveyed to come up with a point value (weighting) 
for a total of 74 criteria and an expected utility (EU). The final value of each 
scenario was summed as the product: 
 
 
EU = ï¥ pi ui 
 
where pi is the point value and ui the utility of each of the n components.  
The criteria covered, among other things, economic aspects (e.g., technical 
efficiency, security of supply, profitability, macro-economic effects), protection of 
environment and health (e.g. using environment as a waste sink, conservation of 
nature and ecosystems, health risks) and social and political aspects (e.g., 
protecting dignity of humans, political stability, social justice). Each criterion was 
allocated a score from 0 to 100 points based on the groups assessment of its 
likely outcome. Unfortunately, few details were available on the system used to 
allocate the weights, although it was noted that the final decision was sensitive to 
these. The final scores showed both the engineers and church representatives 
preferred Scenario 3 (new lifestyle) over Scenario 2 (protection of resources).  
The results are interesting for a number of reasons. The engineers were 
actually surprised to find that their deliberations had led to them selecting 
Scenario 3. This was not what they had expected and the author suggests they 
had probably set some of the weights too low. Also the scoring of the various 
options indicated that people often employ a highly non-linear scale. One of the 
options, for example, had energy savings of 40 percent yet led to a much smaller 
difference (20 percent) in the scores given to that scenario. It was suggested that 
this may have been partly due to people not believing the efficiency figures and 
discounting the benefits to a degree. 
 
 
 
 
 
The choice of weights usually involves subjective judgements about the 
relative importance of the criteria. As Martland (2012) has cautioned: .. âavoid 
thinking that it will be easy to agree on criteria or weights or to think that the public 
will agree with whatever criteria or weights are proposed by any of the partiesâ. As 
with other complex engineering decision problems, even the weighting and scoring 
procedure may in practice require political input. 
 

Engineering Decision-making 
 
 
 
355
Multi-objective decisions with certainty and uncertainty of outcome 
Decision making becomes problematic if some of the decision criteria are not 
quantifiable. In such circumstances, Hardy (1995) has suggested the use of fuzzy 
logic. In an example, a site is to be chosen for storing hazardous waste material. 
Some of the decision criteria are quantifiable (such as transportation costs, surface 
water quality and ground water quality), but others are qualitative and involve 
linguistic descriptions such as âgoodâ or âpoorâ (as are used in aesthetic 
evaluations). 
 
He suggests that fuzzy logic concepts can be employed to treat both 
quantitative and non-quantitative criteria, and discusses two problems: the selection 
of the most appropriate propellant fuel for use in a lunar lander module, and the 
choice of an aeration system to improve water quality in a river. He also refers to 
decision software that can be used in such engineering decision making.     
 
Situations where there is complete knowledge of the system are of course 
much easier to deal with, and in this case it is realistic to search for optimal 
solutions. Such problems are discussed in some detail in Chapter 13 in relation to 
optimisation. 
 
 
Tendering to repair a dam wall 
 
Tabatabaei and Zoppou (2000) report on an engineering project where faulty 
construction work on a concrete dam wall was discovered during routine 
maintenance work. The concrete poured in 1912 near the base of the dam in the 
Australian Capital Territory was found to be of very poor quality â a situation with 
no easy or obvious solution, given the damâs location and role as a water storage 
facility for Canberra, the national capital. Tenders were called and this led to 
three submissions, each proposing a quite different solution, particularly in 
relation to handling possible high flow events that might occur while the repairs 
were being carried out.  
The tenders were assessed using a series of objectives (the total cost, the 
flood risk, the demolition technique and relevant experience) which were 
weighted in the ratios of 100:50:30:10, respectively. Each of the tenders was 
given a score for each objective and the product of the score and weight 
summed. This led to the decision to award the tender to Tender T1. 
The decision on whether to require a coffer dam during repair was based 
on a decision tree analysis where the cost of the coffer dam was compared to 
the expected cost of having no coffer dam based on the assumption of a 70 
percent chance of a rain (potentially leading to a flood) occurring during the 
repairs, and where the probable number of rain days was determined using a 
statistical analysis that summed over all possible occurrences. 
 
Decisions that involve multiple criteria and multiple stakeholders 
Important engineering decisions usually affect the lives of people in the community. 
In the field of water resource management, for example, decisions on flood control 
are vitally important to those people who live in regions that are prone to flooding. 
 
Likewise, all people living in a city will be seriously affected by an inadequate 
water supply. In such circumstances, the entire population may become interested 

Engineering Decision-making 
 
 
 
356
observers of, and possibly stakeholders in, the engineering decisions. Community 
input is needed in engineering decision such as these, and it is not unusual for 
significant disagreement to exist among individuals, even on underlying principles. 
When such differences cannot be resolved, the decisions become political and a 
political solution might become necessary. 
 
On a much smaller scale, it is still usual for decision problems with multiple 
criteria to involve more than one stakeholder. Keller et al. (2009) have explained 
how even in personal decisions there can be many stakeholders, each with different 
objectives and criteria. One of the cases they describe concerns the choice of 
treatment for a man diagnosed with prostate cancer. 
 
Akter and Simonovic (2002) have dealt with a wide range of multiple-criteria, 
multiple-participant decision problems. They discuss practical problems, such as 
decision making for flood control, that involve both multiple criteria and multiple 
participants. They consider deterministic decisions (with certainty of outcome) and 
decisions with uncertainty of outcome. The methods they suggest for dealing with 
these different cases include structuring and measuring the alternative courses of 
action, applying utility theory, and prior and progressive articulation of preferences.  
12.8 USING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION  
In previous discussions we have classified decision problems according to the 
amount of information that is available to the decision maker.  
 
The acquisition of additional information is a feasible option to consider in 
most decision situations. Although additional information will have a cost, it may 
make it possible to move up one or two rungs on the information scale, for example 
from decision making under uncertainty to decision making under risk. Even if the 
decision situation is one of risk, additional information could benefit the decision 
process by setting some of the probability estimates to unity and zero, thus reducing 
the range of possibilities. In complex situations, where there are multiple objectives 
and multiple stakeholders, acquiring additional information can lead to clearer 
thinking and a clearer problem statement, with better decisions and outcomes. 
 
Additional information for engineering decisions can be acquired in various 
ways, with the choice depending on the specific field in which the decision is to be 
made. Options include laboratory testing, pilot studies, theoretical analyses, field 
trials, and engaging an expert or a specialist research agency. In a study of the 
tendering behaviour of construction companies Mochtar and Arditi (2001) found 
that around 50 percent of firms purchased information (sometimes, often or always) 
from research agencies to strengthen their bids, even though the authors considered 
that this was not the preferred method, given its cost.  
 
For the specific case of decisions that involve multiple stakeholders with 
differing viewpoints, role-playing has been proposed as a way to improve outcomes 
(Keller et al., 2009).  
 
In decision situations that lend themselves to modelling, it may be possible to 
carry out sensitivity analyses using possible and likely ranges of values, or 
probabilities if available, for the main variables. In the work of Mankuta et al. 
(2003) probabilities were reported as a base value, but low and high options were 
also given. In this way, it was possible to investigate how sensitive the decisions 
were to the actual probabilities and the results of decisions could be viewed in this 

Engineering Decision-making 
 
 
 
357
light. The idea of using a range of values is one of the features of fuzzy logic and 
fuzzy sets, where, for example, variables are given a range of values in the form of a 
triangular distribution (Chan et al., 2000). Computer modelling can also be 
combined with brute-force computations using search techniques, trial-and-error 
search, simulation and Monte Carlo simulation (Warner and Kabaila, 1968).  
12.9 SUMMARY 
Decision making, like problem solving, is central to almost all aspects of 
engineering work. We commenced this chapter with a review of the types of 
decisions that are studied in decision theory and game theory. These often concern 
decisions where the outcomes are measured in monetary terms. However, the 
concept of utility allows risk aversion and risk acceptance to be taken into account 
in decision making.  
 
In decision situations that involve competition, rational approaches can be 
found, although the logic is rather different to that in simple decision theory. To 
take account of competition, the decision maker needs to think through all the 
options of all the participants, including potential friends and foes, and not just his 
or her own.  
 
While the problems that can be dealt with theoretically are idealised, and often 
not directly applicable to engineering decisions, they provide a useful insight into 
decision making processes and into how to structure decision problems. 
 
Most engineering decision problems are quite complex because there is not a 
single decision criterion to consider, but many. A further complication is that many 
persons and organisations will be affected by the outcomes of a large engineering 
project. The decisions then involve many participants and stakeholders and it is not 
usually feasible to find optimal solutions. A pragmatic approach is to look at a range 
of practical and realistic solutions and to choose the best. Some techniques that have 
been used in complex engineering decision problems have been reviewed.  
 
The theoretical approaches discussed in this chapter provide a useful insight 
into decision-making processes and into how to structure decision problems. This is 
important because engineers have to be able to articulate and explain the rationale 
for their decisions.  
PROBLEMS 
12.1 A computer manufacturer has the possibility of expanding the company's 
operations into New Zealand with the potential of greatly increased profits. The 
managing director considers that the move would lead to a 20 percent chance of 
making the company $10m in profits, but that there would be an 80 percent chance 
of losses of $2m if the move were unsuccessful. If the expansion is not attempted, 
the company would continue to trade with an 80 percent chance of making a profit 
of $2m and a 20 percent chance of breaking even. Based on expected monetary 
value, what would you suggest? Under what circumstances would it not be 
appropriate to use this criterion? 
 
12.2 A government department associated with the Cooperative Research Centre for 
Low Grade Coal has come up with a new process to pre-treat raw coal and has

called for tenders to implement this in a new factory. As Research and Development 
Manager of a consulting firm, you are familiar with the theory behind the process, 
but you are also aware of new developments overseas that may mean the technology 
will be out of date in the near future. The three courses of action available are  
 
(a) do not tender; 
(b) prepare and submit a tender, based on the designated process; 
(c) work on the new overseas development and prepare a tender based on this new 
method. 
 
You estimate that, if you get the contract for the CRC process there is a 70 
percent chance of making a $600,000 profit, a 15 percent chance of breaking even, 
and a 15 percent chance of making a loss of $3m. The cost of preparing the tender 
has been taken into account in the above profit-and-loss and break-even estimates. 
The chances of winning the contract for the CRC process are good: about 70 
percent. 
 
Although the chances of winning the contract on the basis of the new overseas 
developments are much lower, about 40 percent, you stand to make a much larger 
profit. You estimate that, if you get the contract, you would have a 70 percent 
chance of making a profit of $15m. There is a 30 percent chance of losing $3m. The 
costs of preparing the tender and bringing the overseas method to the tendering 
stage have been included in the profit and loss estimates given. 
 
Make any calculations you consider appropriate, state any assumptions you 
decide to make and hence indicate your decision. What is the expected value of 
your decision? 
 
12.3 Assuming there is a 1 in a 600,000* chance of winning $10,000 in a $1 lottery, 
derive the expected value of the return of buying a ticket. (*This figure came from a 
television advertisement running in South Australia in April 2005.) 
 
12.4 Re-analyse Question 12.1 using the utility information given in Table 12.12 
which you have obtained from the managing director about her feeling for the utility 
value of the companyâs profits and losses. Does this change the earlier decision? Is 
the managing director showing risk aversion or risk acceptance in this case?

severity of the interruptions which actually occur.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN  
Optimisation 
 
This chapter introduces general concepts of optimisation. Optimisation is a 
process aimed at identifying the âbestâ solution to a planning or design problem. 
Optimisation may be carried out using judgement, by comparing a large number of 
options or by using analytical techniques. Analytical optimisation techniques may 
be applied to problems that can be represented by one (or more) objective 
functions and a number of constraints. Specific optimisation techniques including 
linear programming, differential calculus, separable programming, dynamic 
programming and genetic algorithms are considered in detail in this chapter. 
13.1 INTRODUCTION 
As outlined in Chapter three, engineering problems are often ill-defined and open-
ended. As such, there is usually no single âcorrectâ answer to an engineering 
problem. The challenge for the engineer is to find the âbestâ solution to a particular 
problem. 
 
The engineering methodology outlined in Chapter 3 emphasizes the 
identification of objectives to be achieved by a particular plan or design and 
measures of effectiveness for ranking alternative solutions. Furthermore, most 
engineering problems have a number of constraints that limit the available 
solutions to the problem. 
 
Optimisation is a process of identifying the âbestâ solution to a problem i.e. 
that solution that achieves the maximum (or minimum) level of the objectives 
while satisfying all of the constraints. Usually there are several objectives to be 
achieved. The choice of a final solution may involve a compromise between these. 
For example, a reservoir for a town water supply is to be designed to achieve the 
following objectives: 
 
ï· 
maximise reliability of the water supply; 
 
ï· 
minimise cost; and 
ï· 
minimise environmental impact. 
 
 
Clearly, no single size of reservoir will satisfy all three of these objectives. A 
large reservoir would be needed to maximise reliability. This is unlikely to have 
the minimum cost or the minimum environmental impact. The reservoir that has 
minimum cost is small in size (or, in fact, no reservoir at all). This will provide a 
water supply with low reliability, although the environmental impact could be low. 
Ultimately, the selection of a final design involves compromise between the 
various objectives. This usually requires the input of community values and a 

364 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
judgement to be made about what is in the best interest of the community as a 
whole. 
 
Optimisation involves the selection of values for a set of decision variables. 
In the above example, the primary decision variables are the location and capacity 
of the reservoir. In general, the decision variables may be continuous or discrete. 
The capacity of a reservoir can take on any positive value within a defined range 
and so is a continuous decision variable. The selection of the location for the 
reservoir is an example of a discrete decision variable, as there will be a finite set 
of suitable locations available and only one of them will be chosen.   
 
A solution to an optimisation problem is any combination of values of the 
decision variables. Any set of values of the decision variables that satisfies all of 
the constraints is called a feasible solution. For a single objective maximisation 
problem, any feasible solution that produces a value of the objective function not 
less than that produced by any other feasible solution is called an optimum 
solution. Similarly for a single objective minimisation problem, any feasible 
solution that produces a value of the objective function not more than that 
produced by any other feasible solution is called an optimum solution. The concept 
of Pareto optimal solutions for multi-objective optimisation problems is discussed 
in Section 9.5. 
 
The following is an example of a simple optimisation problem with 
continuous variables that can be solved using calculus. 
 
Example 13.1: A tank of volume 200 m3 is to be made from stainless steel. It will 
have a cylindrical body and hemispherical ends as shown in Figure 13.1. If the 
material for the ends costs twice as much per square metre as that for the body, 
find the dimensions of the tank that minimise its cost. 
 
 
Figure 13.1 A stainless steel tank. 
 
Solution: In this example, the decision variables are the length of the body of the 
tank and its radius (both in metres). These will be denoted by b and r 
(respectively). The objective is to minimise the cost of the design. If the cost per 
unit area of the body is C $/m2, then the total cost of the tank is given by: 
 
 
Y = 2Cprb + 2C(4pr2) 
 
 
 
 
Y = 2Cprb + 8Cpr 2

Note that the first term in Equation (13.1) represents the cost of the tank 
walls and the second term represents the cost of the ends. As C is constant, it can 
be ignored in the optimisation and the problem becomes:

Having identified the objective function, we need to consider what 
constraints exist. In this case, we require the volume of the tank to equal 200 m3. 
This can be expressed by the following equation:

The first term on the left hand side represents the volume of the cylindrical 
body of the tank and the second term represents the volume of its hemispherical 
ends. Further constraints are required to represent the physical reality that both 
dimensions of the tank must be non-negative, i.e.

(13.5) 
 
 
 
Expressions (13.2) through (13.5) represent a simple optimisation model that 
can be solved to find the dimensions of the tank that will minimise cost while 
satisfying the relevant constraints. The solution of this particular problem is 
discussed in Sections 13.11 and 13.12 of this chapter. 
 
The above example involved only two decision variables and one objective 
function. Real engineering optimisation problems may have hundreds or even 
thousands of decision variables, several objectives and hundreds of constraints. A 
large number of techniques have been developed for the solution of engineering 
optimisation problems. Several of these techniques will be discussed in this chapter 
including linear programming, separable programming, dynamic programming and 
genetic algorithms. The optimisation techniques considered in this chapter deal 
only with problems that have a single objective function. Interested readers are 
referred to Goicoechea et al. (1982) for a discussion of optimisation techniques for 
multiple objectives.  
13.2 APPROACHES TO OPTIMISATION 
In general the following three approaches to optimisation can be identified 
(Meredith et al., 1985): 
 
ï· 
subjective optimisation; 
ï· 
combinatorial optimisation; and 
ï· 
analytical optimisation. 
 
These are described in more detail below. 

366 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
Subjective Optimisation 
The simplest type of optimisation is based on engineering experience and 
judgement. This often takes the form of comparing a number of alternatives and 
selecting the best. In these circumstances, it may be claimed that the design has 
been âoptimisedâ. In other cases, ârules of thumbâ based on experience are used to 
identify an efficient design. For example, for the design of water supply pipelines a 
number of water authorities try to choose pipe sizes such that the pressure loss per 
kilometre of length falls within defined bounds. A typical value is 3m head loss per 
kilometre length of pipe.  
 
Subjective optimisation is used in cases where the objective(s) and/or the 
constraints cannot be formulated in mathematical terms. In other cases, there may 
be so many constraints that the principal task is to identify a design that satisfies all 
of them (i.e. a feasible design). In any case, the application of judgement by 
experienced engineers is an essential part of the design process and should not be 
undervalued. 
Combinatorial Optimisation 
A number of engineering planning and design problems involve the comparison of 
a finite number of discrete alternatives relative to a set of objectives (or selection 
criteria). For problems of this type, combinatorial optimisation techniques are 
appropriate. The simplest combinatorial technique is called complete enumeration 
and involves the evaluation of all of the alternatives according to the criteria and 
the selection of one alternative using appropriate multi criteria techniques (as 
discussed in Section 12.7). This approach may be used where the number of 
combinations is relatively small.  
 
An example of where complete enumeration of alternatives has been applied 
successfully is Emerson Crossing in adelaide, Australia. Emerson Crossing is an 
intersection of two roads in the city of Adelaide that has the unusual feature of 
having a dual railway line crossing diagonally through it (Figure 13.2). 
 
This came about from a desire by the early transportation engineers to reduce 
the number of level crossings where cars and trains were in potential conflict. It 
made excellent sense when traffic volumes were quite low, but by the 1960s the 
traffic volumes on Cross Road and South Road had built up to such levels that the 
delays at this intersection at peak hour were extremely long. This was aggravated 
by the fact that the intersection was closed to traffic in both directions for 15 
minutes of each peak hour due to the passage of trains. A study of ways to alleviate 
the congestion was carried out by the South Australian Highways Department (the 
responsible authority at the time). A large number of options were considered to 
reduce the traffic delays. One class of these options involved the use of grade 
separation at the intersection to provide, spatial separation of road and railway 
traffic. Other options considered included diverting traffic away from the 
intersection, the use of roundabouts, and moving the railway line so that it had 
separate intersections with South Road and Cross Road. For various reasons, the 
grade separation options were considered to be better than the other options. In 
fact, a number of grade separation options were available. These included the 
following:

ï· 
South Road on an overpass or underpass; 
ï· 
Cross Road on an overpass or underpass; and 
ï· 
the railway on an overpass or underpass. 
 
 
Figure 13.2 Layout of Emerson Crossing before the construction of the overpass (Not to scale) 
 
 
These six basic solutions can be combined with each other (e.g. South Road 
on an underpass and the railway on an overpass) to give an additional 6 
combinations. To these can be added the âdo nothingâ alternative to give a total of 
13 alternatives. This is a small enough number for the application of complete 
enumeration to be carried out. 
 
All 13 alternatives were considered in a feasibility study (Section 3.5) in 
order to eliminate the less competitive options. Using appropriate mathematical 
models the options were compared in terms of construction and operational costs, 
reduction in delays to vehicular traffic, likely reduction in accidents and their 
environmental and social impacts. Eventually, the option of putting South Road on 
an overpass was identified as the best option. This was implemented in 1982, and 
has proven to be quite successful. 
 
In many real engineering problems, the number of options can be extremely 
large. This is particularly the case in systems where discrete sizes need to be 
chosen for a large number of elements. For example, the design of engineering 
networks such as road networks, water supply networks, electricity networks and 
communication networks require sizes to be chosen for a large number of elements 
such as roads, pipes, wires or communication channels. As each element is usually 
only available in discrete sizes e.g. number of lanes in a road, pipe sizes and wire 
sizes the problem becomes a large combinatorial optimisation problem. 
Techniques for optimisation of large combinatorial problems are discussed in 
Section 13.15. 
Analytical Optimisation 
Analytical optimisation can be applied when the objective function and constraints 
can be expressed in mathematical form. It involves the application of calculus or 
advanced mathematical optimisation techniques, some of which are discussed in 
detail in Sections 13.3â13.15 of this chapter.

13.3 LINEAR PROGRAMMING 
The simplest case of the general mathematical optimisation problem consists of a 
single linear objective function and one or more linear constraints. This is called 
the linear programming (LP) problem. It may be written as follows: 
 
 
Max (or Min) Z =
c jx j
j=1
n
Ã¥
  
 
 
 
(13.6) 
 
subject to 
 
 
 
aijx j Â£, =, or ï³
{
}bi
j=1
n
Ã¥
  (i = 1, . . ., m) 
 
 
(13.7) 
 
 
 
xj ï³ 0            (j = 1, . . ., n)  
 
 
 
(13.8) 
 
where xj are the decision variables, Z is the objective function, cj are the cost 
coefficients, aij are the constraint coefficients and bi are the right hand sides. cj, aij 
and bi are assumed to be constant and known. Note that the non-negativity 
conditions (13.8) are assumed in all LP problems. 
 
Linear programming has been used to solve many large scale problems in 
engineering, economics, and commerce. Examples include optimising the mix of 
products from a refinery, optimising the assignment of crews to vehicles for a 
public transport system, and optimising the allocation of water among conflicting 
uses. 
 
Example 13.2 The engineer for the Bullbar City Council must decide how to 
allocate the Council's workforce and machinery among various activities. For 
simplicity it will be assumed that only two activities are possible, constructing 
roads and constructing drains. The engineer has estimated that each kilometre of 
new road brings a net benefit of $30,000 per year to the community, whereas each 
kilometre of drain brings a net benefit of $20,000 per year. A kilometre of road 
requires 250 person-days of labour and 640 machine-hours to construct. On the 
other hand, a kilometre of drain requires 500 person-days of labour and 320 
machine-hours to construct. The Council has a workforce of 50 people and 10 
machines. Assuming 200 effective working days of 8 hours each per year, write an 
LP formulation to determine the mix of roads and drains which the Council should 
undertake each year in order to maximise net benefits. 
Solution Let xl be the number of km of roads to be constructed in a year, and x2 be 
the number of km of drains to be constructed in a year. The objective function to 
be maximised is the total net benefits per year (in thousands of dollars), i.e. 
 
 
 
Max Z = 30xl + 20x2 
 
 
 
The available workforce and machinery impose constraints. Considering the 
workforce first, the available resource is 50 people for 200 days, a total of 10,000 
person-days. The required resource is (250xl + 500x2). Therefore: 
 
 
 
250xl + 500x2 Â£ 10,000 
 
 

Optimisation 
369 
 
 
Similarly for machinery, the available resource is 10 machines x 200 days x 8 
hours/day, i.e. 16 000 machine-hours. Therefore: 
 
 
 
640xl + 320x2 Â£ 16,000 
 
 
 
In addition, the lengths of roads and drains constructed cannot be negative, 
and so 
 
 
 
x1 ï³ 0      x2 ï³ 0  
 
 
 
Therefore the problem formulation becomes: 
 
 
 
Max Z = 30x1 + 20x2

13.4 GRAPHICAL SOLUTION OF LP PROBLEMS 
A graphical solution technique will be illustrated for Example 13.2 given above. 
Firstly, consider constraint (13.10). If this were an equality it could be plotted as a 
straight line in (xl, x2) space as shown in Figure 13.3. All combinations of xl and x2 
which satisfy this constraint lie below this line. Clearly any solution above this line 
is infeasible. This is indicated by shading on the infeasible side of the constraint as 
shown. 
 
Figure 13.3 Workforce constraint for the Bullbar City Council problem. 
 
 
In a similar fashion by plotting the other constraints (including the non-
negativity constraints) the feasible solution space (or feasible region) can be 
identified. This is the region ABCD in Figure 13.4. The feasible solution space is

the set of all combinations of the decision variables that satisfy all of the 
constraints of the problem.

The optimum solution may be determined by plotting contours of the 
objective function. As shown in Figure 13.5 these are parallel straight lines for any 
two-variable LP problem. It should be apparent that the optimum solution for this 
problem occurs at point C, i.e. at the intersection of the constraints (13.10) and 
(13.11). This corresponds to the highest value of the objective function Z that can 
be achieved within the feasible region.

The optimum solution is:

If the net benefits of drains relative to roads were changed by a sufficient 
amount, point B or D would become the optimum solution.  
 
It should be noted that for this example, and indeed all LP problems, the 
feasible solution space is a convex region. A convex region is one that satisfies the 
property that a straight line joining any two points in the region only contains 
points in the region. Any region that does not satisfy this property is called a 
non-convex region. 
 
Examples of convex and non-convex regions in two dimensions are 
illustrated in Figure 13.6. It should also be apparent from Figure 13.5 that the 
optimal solution(s) to any two-dimensional LP problem always occurs at one (or 
two) corner points. A corner point is a feasible solution defined by the intersection 
of two constraints. It can be seen that if the contours of Z were parallel to BC, both 
B and C and the points in between would be optimum solutions. 
 
In m dimensions, an extreme point is a feasible solution that occurs at the 
intersection of m constraints. It can be shown that the optimum solution to a 
general LP problem always occurs at one (or more) extreme points.

13.5 CANONICAL AND STANDARD FORM OF AN LP PROBLEM

canonical form or standard form. The canonical form is

(13.15) 
 
 
It has the following features: 
 
ï· 
the objective function is of the maximisation type; 
ï· 
all constraints are of the 'less than or equal to' type; 
ï· 
the right-hand side constants, bi, may be positive or negative; and 
ï· 
all decision variables are non-negative. 
 
 
The canonical form of LP problems is used in Section 13.9 of this Chapter. 
Any LP problem may be rearranged into canonical form using one or more of the 
following operations: 
 
(1) An objective function of the minimisation type can be made into the 
maximisation type by multiplying it by â 1 (and vice versa), e.g. minimising 
Z = 2xl â 3x2 is the same as maximising Y = -2x1 + 3x2.  
 
(2) âGreater than or equal toâ constraints can be changed to 'less than or equal to' 
constraints 
by 
multiplying 
both 
sides 
by 
-1, 
e.g. 
5xl - 4x2 ï³ 12 is equivalent to -5x1 + 4x2 Â£ -12 
 
(3) Equality constraints can be converted into two inequalities, e.g. 
 
4xl + 2x2 = 12 
 
is equivalent to 
 
4xl + 2x2  Â£ 12 and 4xl + 2x2 ï³12 
 
i.e. 
 
4xl + 2x2  Â£ 12 and -4xl - 2x2 Â£ -12 
 
(4) Variables which are unrestricted in sign may be replaced by two nonnegative 
variables; for example, consider the problem 
 
 
 
Max Z = 3y1 + 2y2 
 
 
 
subject to:  
 
 
 
 y1 + y2 Â£ 6 
 
 
 
y1 Â£ 8 
 
 
 
y1 ï³ 0 
 
 
 
y2 unrestricted in sign 
 
 
 
 
 
This may be reformulated by using the substitution y2 = (y2
+ - y2
-) where y2
+ = 
the positive part of y2 and y2
- = the negative part of y2. Thus, the problem becomes: 
 
 
 
Max Z = 3y1 + 2y2
+ - 2y2
-

+ - y2
- Â£ 6  
 
 
y1 Â£ 8 
 
 
 
y1, y2
+, y2
- ï³ 0 
 
 
 
It can be shown that if y2
+ is positive in the final solution, y2
- will be zero and 
vice versa.  
 
 
The standard form of an LP problem may be written as follows: 
 
 
Max (or Min) Z =
c jx j
j=1

xj ï³ 0                  (j = 1, . . ., n) 
 
 
 
(13.18) 
 
 
The standard form has the following features: 
 
 
ï· 
the objective function may be of the maximisation or minimisation type; 
ï· 
all constraints are equations, with the exception of the non-negativity 
conditions which remain as inequalities of the 'greater than or equal to' type; 
ï· 
the right-hand side of each constraint must be non-negative; and  
ï· 
all variables are non-negative. 
 
 
The standard form is used in Section 13.6 of this Chapter. Any LP problem 
can be transformed into standard form by using one or more of the following 
operations (in addition to those listed above): 
 
(1) A negative right-hand side can be made positive by multiplying through by - 
1 (and reversing the sign of the inequality). 
 
(2) Inequality constraints may be converted to equalities by the inclusion of slack 
or surplus variables. For example, the 'less than or equal to' constraint, 
 
2x1 + 4x2 Â£ 15 
 
 
 
 
 
(13.19) 
 
 
may be written as  
 
 
2x1 + 4x2 + S1 = 15  
         
 
where S1 is a slack variable which must be non-negative in order to satisfy 
the original constraint. 
 
(3) Similarly, the 'greater than or equal to' constraint 
 

374 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
 
3xl + 5x2 ï³18 
 
 
 
 
 
(13.20) 
 
 
may be written as 
 
 
3xl + 5x2 â S2 = 18 
 
 
 
where S2 is a surplus variable which must be non-negative. 
 
 
The term slack variable is used because the right-hand side of Equation 
(13.19) often represents the availability of a particular resource (such as 
machine-hours in the case of the Bullbar City Council). If S1 is positive then not all 
of the available resource is being utilized and there is 'slack' in the solution. 
 
Constraints of the 'greater than or equal to' type often represent minimum 
requirements. For example, the right-hand side of Equation (13.20) may represent 
the minimum required output of steel from a particular process. If S2 is positive the 
minimum output is being exceeded and there is a 'surplus' output. 
13.6 BASIC FEASIBLE SOLUTIONS 
By examining the standard form of an LP problem it can be seen that the 
constraints expressed by Equations (13.17) are a set of m linear equations in n 
unknowns (including slack and surplus variables). 
 
Clearly we would expect n to be greater than m. If n is equal to m there is a 
unique solution to the constraint set and optimisation is not required. If n is less 
than m, the problem is over-constrained and there is, in general, no solution that 
satisfies all of the constraint equations. 
 
 
A basic solution to an LP problem is one in which (n - m) of the variables are 
equal to zero. A basic feasible solution to an LP problem is a basic solution in 
which all variables have non-negative values. Thus a basic feasible solution 
satisfies the constraints (13.17) and the non-negativity conditions (13.18). 
 
Let us examine Example 13.2 further. In order to identify the basic solutions, 
we need to express the problem in standard form. This is achieved by introducing 
slack variables S1 and S2 into constraints (13.10) and (13.11) so that the problem 
becomes: 
 
 
 
 
Max Z = 30x1 + 20x2 
 
 
 
 
(13.21) 
 
 
subject to: 
 
  
 
 
250x1 + 500x2 + S1 = 10,000 
 
 
 
(13.22) 
 
 
640x1 + 320x2 + S2 = 16,000 
 
 
 
(13.23) 
 
 
x1, x2, S1, S2 ï³ 0  
 
 
 
 
(13.24) 
 
 
Thus, excluding the non-negativity conditions, there are two constraint 
equations in four variables (including the slack variables S1 and S2). A basic 
solution may be found by setting any two of the variables equal to zero, and 
solving Equations (13.22) and (13.23) for the other two variables. In this manner 

Optimisation 
375 
 
the six basic solutions shown in Table 13.1 can be identified. Each of these basic 
solutions is identified by a letter in Figure 13.4. Clearly only the first four of these 
solutions are basic feasible solutions, as the other two do not satisfy the non-
negativity conditions (13.21).

It should be apparent from Figure 13.4 that each basic feasible solution is an 
extreme point of the feasible region. As it has already been shown that the 
optimum solution to an LP problem is an extreme point, it follows that the 
optimum solution to an LP problem is always a basic feasible solution. 
 
Now consider the basic solutions to this problem a little more carefully. A 
basic solution occurs when two of the variables x1, x2, S1 and S2 equal zero. If we 
set S1 equal to zero in Equation (13.22) we obtain 
 
 
 
250x1 + 500x2 = 10,000 
(i.e. the line BCF in Figure 13.4) 
 
 
Similarly, by setting S2 equal to zero in Equation (13.23) we obtain 
 
 
 
640x1 + 320x2 = 16,000 
(i.e. the line ECD in Figure 13.4) 
 
 
 
The line where xl = 0 is the x2 axis, and vice versa. Thus each constraint line 
(including the xl and x2 axes) in Figure 13.4 corresponds to one variable being 
equal to zero. The basic solutions (where two variables equal zero) occur at the 
intersections of two constraint lines. Furthermore each basic feasible solution 
corresponds to the intersection of two constraints within the feasible region. 
Therefore, the basic feasible solutions must be the extreme points of the feasible 
region. 
13.7 THE SIMPLEX METHOD 
The simplex method is a numerical procedure commonly used for solving LP 
problems. It is based on the property that the optimal solution to an LP problem is 
always a basic feasible solution. The simplex method uses the following steps: 
Step 1 
Identify an initial basic feasible solution (i.e. an extreme point). 
Step 2  
Consider movement from this extreme point to all adjacent extreme 
points and determine whether it is possible to improve the value of the 
objective function. 

376 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
Step 3  
If improvement is possible choose the next extreme point such that the 
maximum rate of change of objective function is achieved and move to 
this point. Return to Step 2. 
Step 4  
If no improvement is possible, an optimum solution has been obtained. 
 
 
The interested reader is referred to Taha (2017) for the details of the simplex 
method. Many computer packages are now available for solving very large LP 
problems using the simplex method.  
13.8 SOME DIFFICULTIES IN SOLVING LP PROBLEMS 
Occasionally difficulties may occur with LP problems caused by poor problem 
formulation or for other reasons. These problems and possible remedies are 
discussed in this Section.  
Degenerate solutions 
A degenerate solution occurs when one or more of the basic variables is equal to 
zero. One degenerate solution may be followed by another degenerate solution in 
which no improvement in the objective function occurs. This does not cause a 
problem with the simplex method and it is quite possible that several degenerate 
solutions may be followed by non-degenerate solutions in which an improvement 
in objective function is obtained. On some occasions, cycling between several 
degenerate solutions may occur. This rarely happens in practice and most 
commercial computer packages can identify it. 
Unbounded solutions 
It is sometimes possible to increase the value of the objective function without 
limit in an LP problem. This indicates a poorly formulated problem. For example: 
 
 
 
Max Z = x1 + 2x2 
 
 
subject to: 
 
 
 
2x1 + x2 ï³ 12 
 
 
x1 + x2 ï³ 8 
 
 
x1, x2 ï³ 0 
 
 
The feasible region for this problem is shown in Figure 13.7. Clearly the 
objective function may be increased without limit in this feasible region. If the 
objective function were of the minimisation rather than maximisation type, an 
optimum solution could be found (assuming positive coefficients in the objective 
function). 

Optimisation 
377 
 
 
Figure 13.7 Feasible region for an unbounded problem. 
No feasible solution 
Another problem which may arise due to poor problem formulation is that there 
may be no solution which satisfies all of the constraints. For example: 
 
 
 
Max Z = 2x1 + x2 
 
 
subject to: 
 
 
 
2x1 + 3x2 ï³ 30 
 
 
2x1 + x2 Â£ 8 
 
 
x1 + 3x2 Â£ 9 
 
 
x1, x2 ï³ 0 
 
 
The constraints to this problem are shown in Figure 13.8. Clearly, there is no 
feasible region and hence no feasible solution to this problem.

Alternate optima 
Occasionally an LP problem has more than one optimum solution. This occurs 
when the objective function is parallel to a boundary of the feasible region. For 
example: 
  
 
 
Max Z = 2x1 + x2 
 
 
subject to: 
 
 
 
x1 + x2 Â£ 8 
 
 
2x1 + x2 Â£ 12 
 
 
x1, x2 ï³ 0 
 
 
The feasible solution space for this problem is shown in Figure 13.9. Also 
shown is the contour for Z = 18. Because contours of the objective function are 
parallel to the second constraint for this problem, it should be clear that the value 
of the objective function is the same at points C and D. So both C and D and all 
points on the boundary between them are alternate optimum solutions to this 
problem. 
 
The simplex method will identify either C or D as the optimum solution and 
then stop. The existence of alternative optima may be indicated as part of the 
output. 
 
 
Figure 13.9 Alternate optima. 
Redundant constraints 
In some LP problems not all of the constraints are boundaries of the feasible 
region. Constraints that are not boundaries are called redundant constraints 
because they have no effect on the solution. For example: 

Optimisation 
379 
 
 
 
 
Max Z = 2x1 + x2 
 
 
subject to: 
 
 
 
x1 + x2 Â£ 8 
 
 
x1 + 2x2 Â£ 12 
 
 
6x1 + 5x2 Â£ 60 
 
 
x1, x2 ï³ 0 
 
 
The constraints and feasible region for this problem are shown in Figure 
13.10. Clearly the constraint 6x1 + 5x2 Â£ 60 is a redundant constraint as it has no 
effect on the feasible region. 
 
 
Figure 13.10 Redundant constraint. 
 
 
The presence of redundant constraints does not in any way inhibit the 
simplex method from finding an optimum solution. However, because their 
presence affects the size of the problem and hence the computer time for its 
solution it is preferable to remove redundant constraints from the formulation if 
they can be readily identified. 
13.9 EXAMPLES OF LP PROBLEMS 
LP problems occur in many engineering design and planning problems. Some 
examples are outlined below.

Consider the proposed reservoir shown schematically in Figure 13.11. The design 
variable is the capacity of the proposed reservoir, K. Flow data have been collected 
at the proposed site for the last T years. Qt (t = 1, . ..  , T) is the known flow in year 
t. The known annual water demand in the city is R. Et (t = 1, . . , T) represents the 
annual evaporation and other losses from the reservoir in year t and is assumed to 
be known. St (t = 0, . . ., T) represents the volume of storage in the reservoir at the 
end of year t. Ot (t = 1, . . ., T) is the spill from the reservoir in year t. St (t = 1, . . ., 
T) and Ot (t = 1, . . ., T) are derived variables whose values will be determined in 
the course of the optimisation. 
 
The reservoir size will be determined on the assumption that the historical 
series of flows will be repeated. The annual demand of the city must be met in 
every year without the reservoir becoming empty. The objective is therefore to 
minimise the required capacity, K, subject to the constraints imposed by: 
 
ï· 
continuity; and 
ï· 
the reservoir capacity not being exceeded. 
 
 
Figure 13.11 Reservoir design problem. 
 
 
The continuity constraint for year t is as follows: 
 
 
 
St â St -1 = Qt â Et â R â Ot 
 
i.e. the change in storage in the reservoir in year t equals the total inflow minus the 
total outflow. The constraint on capacity at the end of year t is simply 
 
 
 
St Â£ K 
 
 
It is usual to assume that the reservoir has at least the same storage level at 
the end of the T years as at the beginning. This allows future demand to be met if 
the historical sequence repeats itself, i.e.

to a road network. A simple road network is shown in Figure 13.12.  
 
 
Figure 13.12 Portion of a road network. 
 
 
The usual demand information for the network will be expressed in terms of 
an origin-destination matrix, i.e. the volume of traffic wishing to travel from each 
origin to each designation in a defined time period. Nodes 1 and 3 in Figure 13.12 
are origins and nodes 7 and 9 destinations. A typical origin-destination matrix is 
given in Table 13.2. Other information available is the capacity (vehicles/h) and 
the travel time in each direction (minutes) for each road. Typical values are given 
in Table 13.3. In this example the capacity and travel time is the same in both 
directions for each road, although this is not necessarily always the case. The 
objective is to minimise the total time of travel for all traffic.

The LP problem to be solved is defined by the objective function (13.32) and 
the constraints (13.33), (13.34), and (13.35). 
 
In a more realistic case the travel time on each road depends on the volume 
of traffic on it. In addition, each driver tries to minimise his or her own travel time 
instead of the system being at a global minimum. In these cases, the objective 
function becomes non-linear but the constraints have the same form. 
13.10 DUALITY 
Duality is an important concept in mathematical analysis that often gives valuable 
insights into the physical problem being solved. In LP, every problem has another 
problem associated with it called the dual. By solving the original or primal 
problem using the simplex method, the solution to the dual is found automatically. 
The dual variables have an important interpretation that adds considerable 
information to an LP solution. 
Writing the dual problem 
In Section 13.5 the canonical form of an LP problem was given as 

384

Max Z =
c jx j
j=1
n
Ã¥
  
 
 
 
 
(13.13)

Ã¥
(i =1,...,m)  
 
 
 
(13.14)  
 
 
xj ï³ 0           (j = 1, . . ., n)  
 
 
 
(13.15) 
 
 
For an LP problem in canonical form the dual problem may be written using 
the following rules: 
 
1. There is a dual variable corresponding to each primal constraint and a primal 
variable corresponding to each dual constraint. 
2. If the primal problem is of the maximisation type, the dual problem is of the 
minimisation type and vice versa. 
3. All of the constraints in the maximisation problem are of the 'less than or equal 
to' type. All of the constraints in the minimisation problem are of the 'greater 
than or equal to' type. 
4. The coefficients of the objective function in the primal problem are the 
right-hand sides in the dual problem and vice versa. 
5. The variables in both problems are non-negative. 
 
 
To write the dual to the problem given by (13.13) - (13.15), we need to define 
m dual variables yi(i = 1, . . ., m) with one corresponding to each primal constraint. 
The dual problem is: 
 
 
 
Min W =
biyi
i=1
m
Ã¥
  
 
 
 
 
(13.36) 
 
 
subject to: 
 
 
 
aijyi ï³c j
i=1
m
Ã¥
(j =1,...,n) 
 
 
 
 
(13.37) 
 
 
yi ï³ 0           (i = 1, . . ., m)  
 
 
 
(13.38) 
 
 
Note that if these rules are applied to the problem defined by Conditions 
(13.36) - (13.38), the 'primal' problem is regained (i.e. Conditions (13.13) - 
(13.15)). Clearly, symmetry exists between the two problems. 
 
It can be shown that, for any feasible solutions of the primal and dual, Z Â£ W. 
That is, the objective function value for a feasible solution of the maximisation 
problem is a lower bound on the objective function value of the minimisation 
problem. Furthermore, if Z* is the maximum value of Z and W* is the minimum 
value of W then 
 
 
 
Z* = W*  
 
 
 
 
 
(13.39) 

Optimisation 
385 
 
 
 i.e. at optimality, both problems have the same objective function value. For 
example, the primal problem of Example 13.2 is given by (13.9) - (13.12): 
 
 
 
Max Z = 30x1 + 20x2 
 
 
 
 
(13.9) 
 
 
subject to:  
 
 
250x1 + 500x2 Â£ 10,000 
 
 
 
 
(13.10) 
 
 
640x1 + 320x2 Â£ 16,000 
 
 
 
 
(13.11) 
 
 
x1, x2 ï³ 0 
 
 
 
 
 
(13.12) 
 
 
As this is already in canonical form, the dual can readily be written as 
 
 
 
Min W = 10,000y1 + 16,000y2 
 
 
 
(13.40) 
 
 
subject to:  
 
 
 
250y1 + 640y2 Â£ 30

500y1 + 320y2 Â£ 20 
 
 
 
 
(13.42) 
 
 
y1, y2 ï³ 0 
 
 
 
 
 
(13.43) 
 
 
Writing each problem in standard form we obtain for the primal problem: 
 
 
 
Max Z = 30x1 + 20x2 
 
 
 
 
(13.44) 
 
 
subject to: 
 
 
 
250x1 + 500x2 + S1 = 10,000 
 
 
 
(13.45) 
 
 
640x1 + 320x2 + S2 = 16,000 
 
 
 
(13.46) 
 
 
x1, x2, S1, S2 ï³ 0  
 
 
 
 
(13.47) 
  
and, for the dual problem: 
 
 
 
Min W = 10,000y1 + 16,000y2 
 
 
 
(13.48) 
 
 
subject to: 
 
 
 
250y1 + 640y2 â S3 = 30 
 
 
 
 
(13.49) 
 
 
500y1 + 320y2 â S4 = 20 
 
 
 
 
(13.50) 
 
 
y1, y2, S3, S4 ï³ 0  
 
 
 
 
(13.51) 
 
 
The solution to the primal problem was found previously (Sections 13.4 and 
13.7) to be 
 
 
 
Z = 800, x1 = 20, x2 = 10, S1 = S2 = 0 
 
 

386 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
 
The dual problem defined by (13.40) to (13.43) can be solved graphically or 
by using an LP computer package to give: 
 
 
 
W = 800, y1 = 1/75, y2 = 1/24, S3 = S4 = 0 
 
 
thus verifying Equation (13.39). Furthermore it can be shown that the simplex 
solution to a primal problem contains the solution to the dual (and vice versa).  
 
Most LP computer packages (including Excel Solver) will give the optimal 
values of the dual variables when they solve the primal problem. 
Interpretation of the dual variables 
Refer back to the primal problem defined by (13.13) - (13.15). In many problems, 
the right-hand side element of the ith primal constraint, bi, may be interpreted as 
the availability of the ith resource. Combining Equations (13.36) and (13.39), we 
have at optimality: 
 
 
 
Ã¥
=
=
=
m
i
i
i y
b
W
Z
1
*
*
*
 
 
 
 
 
(13.52) 
 
where yi* is the value of yi at optimality (i = 1, . . ., m). 
 
Therefore, the optimum value of the ith dual variable, yi*, may be interpreted 
as the additional output Z which could be obtained by a unit increase in the ith 
resource. Thus, if bi were increased by one unit, we would expect Z* to increase by 
yi* units. 
 
In the above problem, the dual variable y1 represents the additional net 
benefits (in thousands of dollars) if the right-hand side of constraint (13.10) were 
increased by one unit. In this case this represents an additional person-day of 
labour. Similarly y2 represents the additional net benefits (in thousands of dollars) 
if the right-hand side of constraint (13.10) were increased by one unit, i.e. by 
having one extra machine-hour available. Therefore 
 
 
 
y1 = 1/75 thousand dollars/person-day 
 
 
 
y2 = 1/24 thousand dollars/machine-hour 
 
 
 
y1 = $13.33/person-day 
 
 
 
y2 = $41.67/machine-hour 
 
 
Expressed in this form the dual variables are shadow prices for the 
corresponding resources. The shadow price of a resource is the economic value of 
having an additional unit of the resource available. 
 
If additional labour can be hired at less than the shadow price of $13.33 per 
day the Council would make a net gain by doing so. Similarly if additional 
machine time can be obtained at less than its shadow price of $41.67 per hour a net 
gain can be made. Of course, this gain by employing additional labour or machines

will only apply for increases that are not so large as to cause a change in the 
optimum solution. 
13.11 NON-LINEAR OPTIMISATION 
In Sections 13.3 to 13.10 a special case of optimisation called linear programming 
(LP) is examined. This applies to problems with a single linear objective function 
and a set of linear constraints. Many general concepts of optimisation can be 
demonstrated using LP. However, the assumption of linearity is often not 
appropriate for real engineering systems. In general, the objective function and/or 
constraints may be non-linear, if indeed they can be expressed in mathematical 
form.  
 
There are many techniques available for the solution of non-linear 
optimisation problems. In the following sections, the techniques of separable 
programming and dynamic programming are considered. Many practical 
engineering problems do not lend themselves to the use of traditional optimisation 
techniques. However, it is usually possible to develop a simulation model of the 
system under consideration. Computer simulation can then be used in a 
trial-and-error search for the optimum solution. In recent years, a new branch of 
optimisation techniques called heuristic techniques (or evolutionary algorithms) 
has developed. These are guided search techniques that work in conjunction with a 
simulation model to search the decision space in an efficient manner and identify a 
number of ânear optimalâ solutions. Heuristic optimisation methods are discussed 
in more detail in Section 13.15. 
 
The general single-objective, non-linear optimisation problem may be written 
as: 
 
 
 
Max Z = f(x1, x2, . . , xn)

This problem differs from the general LP problem (Conditions 13.6 - 13.8) in the 
following three ways: 
 
1. The feasible solution space for a non-linear problem may be either convex or 
non-convex. (This follows from the fact that the boundaries of the feasible 
region may, in general, be generated by non-linear functions. Figure 13.6 
illustrates some non-convex feasible regions.) 
2. An optimum solution to a non-linear problem may occur at any point in the 
feasible region (not necessarily at an extreme point). 
3. It is possible for more than one 'optimum' to exist. The solution corresponding 
to the absolute maximum (or minimum) of the objective function is called the 
global optimum; all other optima are called local optima. 

388 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
 
Two examples are used to illustrate the second point.  
 
Example 13.3 Consider the following problem: 
 
 
 
Min Z = (x1 - 2)2 + (x2 - 3)2 
 
 
 
subject to: 
 
 
 
2x1 + x2 Â£14 
 
 
 
x1 + 3x2 Â£15 
 
 
 
x1,x2 ï³0 
 
 
 
The feasible solution space and contours of the objective function for this 
problem are shown in Figure 13.13. The minimum value of Z equals zero and 
occurs at xl = 2, x2 = 3. This is in the interior of the feasible region. 
 
 
 
Figure 13.13 Optimum solution at interior of the feasible region. 
 
Example 13.4 Consider the following problem: 
 
 
Max Z = x1 x2 
 
 
 
subject to:

The feasible region and contours of Z are shown in Figure 13.14. In this case 
the optimum solution (Z = 38.49 at xl = 5.77, x2 = 6.67) lies on the boundary of the 
feasible region but not at an extreme point. 
 
In relation to the existence of local optima, it is useful to think of the 
objective function surface as a range of mountains. In a maximisation problem 
every peak is a local optimum, and the highest peak is the global optimum. Of 
course, in many problems, the objective function has only one peak and there are 
no local optima. Depending on the constraints this may or may not correspond to 
the optimum solution. 
 
 
 
Figure 13.14 Optimum solution at boundary of the feasible region. 
         
 
In linear programming, the feasible solution space is always convex, the 
optimum solution always occurs at an extreme point and local optima do not occur. 
The three differences between linear and non-linear optimisation listed above make 
non-linear optimisation considerably more difficult than linear optimisation. In 
fact, there is no single solution technique that works for all non-linear optimisation 
problems. Many specific techniques have been developed, each of which is 
applicable to a certain category of non-linear optimisation problems. The 
techniques may be grouped into the following categories: 
 
ï· 
the graphical technique; 
ï· 
classical optimisation techniques; and 
ï· 
numerical techniques. 
 
 
The graphical technique may be used for problems with only one or two 
decision variables. It involves plotting the constraints and the objective function in 
terms of the decision variables in order to identify the optimum solution. The 
technique is illustrated by Examples 13.3 and 13.4 considered earlier. It is 
generally only suitable for simple problems.

13.12 UNCONSTRAINED PROBLEMS USING CALCULUS 
The general unconstrained optimisation problem is: 
 
 
 
Max Z = f(x1, x2, . . ., xn)   
 
 
 
(13.55) 
 
where f(x1, x2, . ., xn) is any non-linear function of the n decision variables x1, . ., xn. 
This is perfectly general, as a minimisation problem can be converted into a 
maximisation problem by multiplying the objective function by -1. Firstly consider 
the single-variable case: 
 
 
 
Max Z = f(x) 
 
 
 
 
 
(13.56) 
 
 
Classical differential calculus can be used to find the maxima of f(x) provided 
that f(x) and its first- and second-order derivatives exist and are continuous for all 
values of x. 
 
A necessary condition for a particular solution xo to be a maximum of f(x) is: 
 
 
 
à¯à¯(à¯«)
à¯à¯«á
à¯«à­à¯«à°¬= 0  
 
 
 
 
(13.57) 
 
 
The solutions to Equation (13.57) are called stationary points and may 
include maxima, minima, and points of inflection. A point of inflection is a point 
where f(x) has zero slope but is neither a maximum nor a minimum. For example, 
the function f(x) = x3 has a point of inflection at x = 0 as shown in Figure 13.15. 
 
 
Figure 13.15 Point of inflection. 
 
A sufficient condition for a stationary point x0 to be a maximum of f(x) is:

Example 13.1 (repeated): A tank of volume 200 m3 is to be made from stainless 
steel. It will have a cylindrical body and hemispherical ends as shown in Figure 
13.15. If the material for the ends costs twice as much per square metre as that for 
the body, find the dimensions of the tank that minimise its cost. 
 
Solution: Let the length of the body of the tank be b m and its radius be r m. The 
formulation given in Section 13.1 is repeated below. 
 
 
 
Min Z = 2prb + 8pr2 
 
 
 
 
(13.2) 
 
 
subject to the volume constraint: 
 
 
 
pr2b + 4pr3 3 = 200 
 
 
 
 
(13.3) 
 
 
This constraint can be written as an equality because the minimum cost tank 
will not have excess volume in this case. Using Equation (13.3) we can substitute 
for b in the objective function 
 
 
 
b =
200 - 4pr3 3
[
]
pr2
 
 
 
 
 
(13.60) 
 
 
Thus (13.2) becomes: 
 
 
 
Min Z = 400
r + 16
3 pr2 
 
 
 
 
(13.61) 
 
which is an unconstrained single-variable optimisation. The necessary condition 
(13.57), is found by differentiating Z with respect to r, 
 
 
 
dZ
dr = -400
r
2
+ 32pr

= 0 
 
 
then solving for r gives 
 
 
 
r = 2.285 m 
 
 
substituting into Equation (13.3), 
 
 
 
b = 9.146 m 
 
 
 
Now checking the sufficiency condition (13.58):

which is positive for all positive values of r, therefore the above solution is a 
minimum. In practice the chosen dimensions would be rounded off, e.g. b = 9 m, 
r = 2.3 m. 
 
The necessary and sufficient conditions for the unconstrained multivariate 
case are discussed in Appendix 13A. Classical optimisation techniques can be 
extended to solve constrained multivariate problems (particularly those with 
equality constraints). This is beyond the scope of this book and the interested 
reader is referred to Taha (2017) or Ossenbruggen (1984) for a treatment of this 
topic. 
 
Numerical optimisation techniques are often preferred to calculus-based 
techniques because of the difficulty in applying the latter to problems of reasonable 
size. A large number of numerical techniques are available for solving non-linear 
optimisation problems. 
 
The techniques considered in this chapter are separable programming and 
dynamic programming. Taha (2017) and Beightler et al. (1979) contain a more 
detailed treatment of various numerical techniques suitable for solving non-linear 
optimisation problems. 
13.13 SEPARABLE PROGRAMMING 
Separable programming is an extension of linear programming. It works by 
converting a non-linear optimisation problem into an LP problem that 
approximates the original non-linear one. Separable programming can only be 
applied to separable functions. A function f(xl, x2,. . ., xn) is said to be separable if it 
can be expressed as the sum of n single-variable functions fl(xl), . . ., fj(xj), . . ., 
fn(xn). 
 
Although separable programming can be used to approximate any continuous 
non-linear function it is most effective when the following special conditions 
apply: 
 
ï· 
the individual functions, fj(xj), of the objective function are concave for a 
maximisation problem or convex for minimisation problems; and 
ï· 
the constraints define a convex feasible region. 
 
 
A convex function is one that has the property that a straight line joining any 
two points on the function always lies on or above the function. For a concave 
function a straight line joining any two points on the function always lies on or 
below the function. Examples of convex and concave functions are shown in 
Figure 13.16. A convex region has been defined in Section 13.4. 
 

Optimisation 
393 
 
 
Figure 13.16 Convex and concave functions 
 
 
If the properties defined above do not apply, separable programming involves 
the use of integer variables. This is beyond the scope of this book. The interested 
reader is referred to Taha (2017). 
 
Separable programming always yields a global optimum to the approximate 
linear problem. To illustrate the separable programming technique, consider the 
minimisation of the convex objective function shown in Figure 13.17. The 
non-linear function is approximated by a series of straight line segments between 
selected values of x, namely 
1
ï¬, 
2
ï¬, â¦.., 
K
ï¬ which must be selected to span the 
full range of likely values of x.

This is a point on the straight line segment between points A and C. Clearly 
the line segments AB and BC lie below this and an LP solution which is

with only two adjacent weights non-zero. 
 
Example 13.5: A cylindrical tank is to be made from a 6 m square sheet of metal as 
shown in Figure 13.19. The tank will be h metres high and d metres in diameter. 
The height of the tank must not be more than twice its diameter. Use separable 
programming to find the dimensions of the tank that maximise its volume.

Clearly, maximising log V is equivalent to maximising V. As log d and log h 
are concave functions in a maximisation objective, we can use separable 
programming without integer variables. 
 
It is now necessary to approximate log d and log h over a suitable range. First 
consider log h. From Equation (13.68) it is obvious that h must be less than 6 m. 
An approximation to log h for h between 0.5 m and 6 m is shown in Figure 13.20.

13.14 DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING 
Dynamic programming is a non-linear optimisation technique that is applicable to 
a wide class of multi-stage decision problems. The term dynamic indicates the 
application of the technique to problems that involve movement from one point in 
time or space to another point by means of a number of intermediate stages 
(intervals of time or distance). At each stage a decision has to be taken, i.e. a 
choice from several alternatives has to be made, and the problem is to find the 
optimum sequence of decisions. The method will be illustrated by the following 
example. 
 
 
Example 13.6: Goods are to be transported by truck from city A to city K via the 
highway network shown schematically in Figure 13.21. The cost of transport on 
each length of highway in dollars is indicated on the figure. The problem is to find 
the minimum-cost route from city A to city K. 
 
 
Figure 13.21 Highway routes and travel costs in dollars. 
 
Solution: Inspection of Figure 13.21 indicates that, regardless of the route taken, 
the truck must pass through three other cities. Thus we may consider the problem 
to consist of four sequential decisions. We say that the problem consists of four 
stages. A stage is defined as the interval that separates consecutive decision points.

One method for determining the minimum-cost route would be to evaluate all 
alternatives. This is called complete enumeration, and in this case it would involve 
the costing of 17 feasible routes. For a larger problem containing, for example, 6 
stages and 10 cities at each stage, there would be 105 alternative paths to evaluate. 
Clearly a more efficient approach is needed. Dynamic programming provides such 
an approach. 
 
Dynamic programming is based on the Principle of Optimality, which may be 
stated as follows: 
 
An optimal policy must have the property that regardless of the decisions 
leading to a particular state, the remaining decisions must constitute an 
optimal sequence for leaving that state. 
 
 
As discussed in Section 2.4, the 'state' of a system summarizes concisely its 
entire previous history and therefore allows the future behaviour to be determined 
for any future input. In this example the states are the cities passed through. When 
applied to the current problem, the principle of optimality means that if the 
optimum route passes through state F, it must conclude with the optimum route 
from F to K. 
 
Thus the principle of optimality can be applied one stage at a time through 
the network in order to identify the minimum-cost path. Although it is possible to 
proceed either backwards or forwards in time, it is usually advantageous to work 
backwards. The present problem will be worked backwards. 
 
With one stage to go, the truck could be in state H, I, or J. There is no choice 
of destination, which must be K. Nevertheless the calculations are set up in tabular 
form in order to be consistent with the rest of the solution. The information with 
one stage to go is summarized in Table 13.5(a). Regardless of the initial state, the 
decision must be to move to K. The optimum decisions and corresponding 
minimum costs for these trips are summarized in Table 13.5(a). 
 
With two stages to go the truck could be in city E, F, or G and a decision 
must be made regarding the next state. The minimum cost for each decision is the 
sum of the cost for the first stage plus the minimum cost for the remaining stages. 
This information is summarized in Table 13.5(b). 
 
If starting in city E there is no direct route to city J, so the choice is between 
cities H and I. The minimum cost of proceeding through H is the direct cost ($6) 
plus the minimum cost from H onwards which is obtained from Table 13.5(a) as 
$9. Similarly, the minimum cost of proceeding from E through I is the direct cost 
($6) plus the minimum cost from I onwards ($8). The optimum decision from E 
corresponds to the smallest cost, namely $14 via city I. Similar calculations are 
made for the initial states F and G. 
 
Table 13.5(b) indicates the optimum decisions from all cities with two stages 
to go. Thus if a truck driver should ever find himself in city G, the optimum 
decision is to go to city J, and so on. 
 
At this point we have evaluated all possible paths over the last two stages. 
Now with three stages to go, dynamic programming enables us to evaluate only a 
subset of all possible paths.

Table 13.5(c) summarizes the calculations with three stages to go. If starting 
in city B, the choice is between proceeding through city E or F. The minimum cost 
of travelling through E is the sum of the direct cost ($6) plus the minimum cost 
from E onwards. The latter term is given in Table 13.5(b) as $14. The minimum 
cost of travelling through city F may be assessed in a similar way. Thus the 
optimum route from B is via city F at a cost of $19. The minimum cost route from 
states C and D are also indicated in Table 13.5(c). 
 
Finally, with four stages to go the initial state is A and the choice is between 
cities B, C, and D. The minimum cost via B is the direct cost of $3 plus the 

400 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
minimum cost from B onwards ($19 from Table 13.5(c)). The minimum-cost route 
is via C at a cost of $19. 
 
The optimum route through the network can be determined by working 
forwards from the starting state A using Table 13.5. Table 13.5(d) indicates that 
from A we should proceed to C. Table 13.5(c) shows that G is the optimum choice 
from C. From G we go to J (Table 13.5(b)) and from J to K (Table 13.5(a)). 
Therefore the minimum cost route is A-C-G-J-K at a cost of $19. Note also that the 
dynamic programming solution identifies the optimum solution extending from 
any non-optimal intermediate state. For example, should an incorrect initial 
decision lead to B instead of C, the optimal subsequent sequence is B-F-I-K or 
B-F-J-K. 
 
The benefits of using dynamic programming to solve this problem should be 
apparent from Table 13.5. With three stages to go only seven comparisons had to 
be made, even though there are seventeen possible routes through the last three 
stages. For larger problems, the advantage of using dynamic programming is more 
marked. For example, a problem with six stages and ten states at each stage 
contains 105 paths, but dynamic programming involves only 410 comparisons. 
 
It should be noted that dynamic programming involves the implicit 
evaluation of all possible paths. Therefore it always achieves the global optimum. 
It is clearly a very powerful technique for problems that can be organized into an 
appropriate form. 
The dynamic recursive equation 
Although computer packages for solving general dynamic programming problems 
are available, it is often better for the analyst to write a computer program for the 
specific problem being solved. The tabular form of solution given above is suitable 
for hand solution of dynamic programming problems. Computer codes for solving 
dynamic programming problems rely on the development of a suitable recursive 
equation as follows: 
 
ï· 
Let cn(i,j) be the cost of proceeding from state i with n stages to go to state j 
with (n-1) stages to go. 
ï· 
Let fn(i) be the cost of the optimum policy to the end of the final stage when 
starting in state i with n stages to go. 
ï· 
Let N be the total number of stages in the problem. 
 
 
Then the dynamic recursive relationship for a minimisation problem may be 
written as:

(13.80) 
 
 
Thus, the cost of the optimum policy when starting in state i with n stages to 
go is the minimum over all feasible states j of going from i to j plus the cost of the 
optimum policy when in state j with n-1 stages to go.

The use of the dynamic recursive equation will be demonstrated for a 
problem of reservoir operation. This is typical of inventory type problems that 
involve carry-over storage of various commodities such as raw materials, finished 
product or, as in this case, water. 
 
Example 13.7: A reservoir of capacity 6 units is situated on a river and is used to 
regulate flow releases to downstream irrigators. A maximum of 4 units can be 
released in one season. An optimum release policy is required over the next four 
seasons beginning with winter. The economic benefits to irrigators for various 
releases are shown in Table 13.6. The expected inflows to the reservoir over the 
next four seasons are 4, 3, 1, and 2 units, respectively. At the beginning of winter 
the reservoir starts with 3 units in storage and it must have at least 3 units in 
storage at the end of autumn. Use dynamic programming to find the optimum 
release policy.

Solution: The stages in this problem are the four seasons; the state variable is the 
storage in the reservoir at the end of each season as this summarizes the effects of 
all previous inputs and decisions. The objective function (to be maximised) is the 
total benefits of water released for irrigation. 
 
Figure 13.22 shows the feasible states for this problem. Given the initial 
storage of 3 units and the winter inflow of 4 units the minimum storage at the end 
of winter is 3 units corresponding to a release of 4 units. The maximum storage is 6 
units which corresponds to the release of 1 unit. (A release of zero units is not 
possible because a spill of 1 unit will occur in any case.) At the end of spring a 
minimum storage of 2 units can be achieved by releasing 4 units from the initial 
storage of 3 units. 
 
At the end of summer, the minimum feasible storage is 1 unit which can be 
achieved via several paths. Although a storage of zero units can be achieved, it is 
not possible to come up to the desired storage of 3 units at the end of autumn from 
this state. The storage at the end of autumn will be 3 units in most cases as there is 
no advantage in having more water in storage. However, if the storage at the end of 
summer is 6 units, the minimum achievable storage at the end of autumn is 4 units. 
 
The dynamic recursive equation (13.80) will be applied backwards in time to 
this problem. In this case, let in be the reservoir storage with n stages remaining, xn 
be the reservoir release during the current stage with n stages remaining, and qn the 
inflow during the current stage with n stages remaining (known).

(13.81) 
 
i.e. the reservoir storage with (n-1) stages remaining is the storage with n stages 
remaining minus the release plus the inflow during the current stage. Therefore, the 
dynamic recursive relation for this problem becomes:

where fn(in) is the maximum benefit when in state i with n stages remaining and 
cn(xn) is the benefit of releasing xn when n stages remain. Substituting Equation 
(13.81) into Equation (13.82) gives

The calculations are summarized in Table 13.7(d). To find the optimum 
release policy over the four seasons we work backwards through Table 13.7 as 
follows: release 1 unit in winter (leaving a final storage of 6), release 4 units in 
spring (final storage = 5), release 3 units in summer (final storage =3), and release 
2 units in autumn (final storage = 3). The economic benefits are $8.0M for the 
year.  
 
In actual reservoir operations the future inflows are usually not known with 
certainty, but only in a probabilistic sense. In this case an extension of dynamic 
programming called stochastic dynamic programming may be applied. This will 
not be discussed in this book. 
Dimensionality in dynamic programming 
The examples considered above both contain only one state variable. In the case of 
Example 13.6 the state variable is the city that the truck is located in at a particular 
time. In the case of Example 13.7, the state variable is the volume of water in 
storage at the start of any stage. Many real problems contain more than one state 
variable. An example involves the operation of a system of n interconnected 
reservoirs. Here the state of the system at any time is summarized by the storage in 
each of the reservoirs and there are n state variables. 
 
An increase in the number of state variables significantly increases the 
amount of computational effort to solve dynamic programming problems. This has 
been referred to as the curse of dimensionality. It may be illustrated by the 
reservoir operating problem. Suppose it is desired to apply dynamic programming 
to a single reservoir. If we divide the volume of the reservoir into 10 discrete 
levels, there are 10 feasible states at each stage. Suppose we now consider a system 
of n reservoirs, with the storage in each one being able to take on any one of 10 
discrete values. The total number of states at each stage of this problem is 10n. For 
example, if n=4 there are 10 000 feasible states at each stage. In practical terms, 
dynamic programming problems are limited to around four state variables because 
of the curse of dimensionality. 
13.15 HEURISTIC OPTIMISATION METHODS 
In recent years quite a deal of research has been carried out into a new class of 
optimisation techniques that might loosely be called âheuristic optimisation 
algorithmsâ. These include techniques such as genetic algorithms, the evolutionary 
algorithm, differential evolution, ant colony optimisation, particle swarm 
optimisation and shuffled complex evolution (Michalewicz and Fogel, 2004). All 
of these methods have the following features in common: 

406 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
1. 
They deal with a population of solutions rather than a single solution at any 
one time. 
2. 
They are effectively âguided search methodsâ that utilise a simulation model 
of the system under study. The model can include any non-linear or logical 
constraints or variables. Thus any system that can be modelled can be 
optimised using one of these techniques. 
3. 
They usually involve some random processes, so that they may be considered 
to be âstochasticâ optimisation methods.  
4. 
They usually do not reach a single optimum solution but progressively 
improve the population of solutions that they are working with over time. 
5. 
One cannot prove that the true optimal solution has been obtained. Effectively 
the methods identify ânear-optimalâ solutions. 
 
 
In this text only the genetic algorithm (GA) technique will be considered in 
detail as this is a commonly used method that has proven to be very efficient. This 
is discussed in the next section. 
Genetic Algorithm Optimisation 
Holland (1975) was one of the early advocates of genetic algorithms, although they 
could be viewed as descended from the work of Box (1957) who used evolutionary 
techniques for optimisation. The publication of the book by Goldberg (1989) 
inspired a large number of engineering applications of GA optimisation. The 
applications include structural optimisation (Goldberg and Samtani, 1986), 
optimising the operation of pumps in gas pipelines (Goldberg and Kuo, 1987), 
control system optimisation for aerospace applications (Krishnakumar and 
Goldberg, 1990) and the optimum design of water supply networks (Simpson et al., 
1994). 
 
In essence GAs are a set of guided search routines that work in conjunction 
with a mathematical or computer simulation model of a system in order to optimise 
aspects of the systemâs design or operation. Some distinguishing features of GAs 
compared to the traditional optimisation techniques such as linear programming 
and dynamic programming considered earlier in this chapter are as follows 
(Simpson et al., 1994): 
 
1. 
GAs work directly with a population of solutions rather than a single solution. 
This population is spread throughout the solution space, so the chance of 
reaching the global optimum is increased significantly; 
2. 
GAs deal with the actual discrete sizes available so that roundoff of 
continuous variables is not required; 
3. 
Because GAs work with a population of solutions, they identify a number of 
near-optimal solutions. These solutions could correspond to quite different 
configurations that may have advantages in terms of non-quantified 
objectives such as environmental or social objectives; and 
4. 
GAs use only information about the objective or fitness function and do not 
require the existence or continuity of derivatives of the objectives with 
respect to the decision variables. 
 

Optimisation 
407 
 
 
GAs work by analogy to population genetics and involve operators such as 
selection, crossover and mutation. Unlike techniques such as linear programming, 
they do not necessarily converge to the global optimal solution. However, because 
they work in conjunction with a simulation model they can handle any non-linear, 
discontinuous or logical set of objective functions or constraints. In essence, any 
system that can be simulated on a computer can be optimised using GAs. 
Hollandâs Schema Theorem (Holland, 1975) suggests that increasingly fit solutions 
will be present in exponentially increasing numbers in succeeding generations in a 
GA run. 
Application of Genetic Algorithms 
Combinatorial optimisation was introduced in Section 13.2. It was noted that some 
engineering problems involve extremely large combinations of decision variables. 
The number of combinations can be so great that it is not feasible to simulate all 
alternatives in a reasonable amount of computer time. Genetic algorithms can be 
applied to these large combinatorial optimisation problems. An example of such 
problems is the New York Tunnels problem that was first studied by Schaake and 
Lai (1969). The basic layout of the system is shown in Figure 13.23. 
 
 
 
Figure 13.23 Layout of the New York Water Supply Tunnels 
 
 
Water is supplied from Hillview Reservoir through 21 major tunnels ranging 
in size from 1.524 m to 5.182 m in diameter. In Figure 13.23 the lines represent the 
various tunnels and the nodes represent junctions in the tunnels where water is 
distributed to many smaller pipes in the network. These smaller pipes are not

shown. At the time of the study, it was anticipated that the system would be unable 
to meet forecast increases in demand while supplying adequate pressures. Hence 
the problem was to identify which tunnels should be duplicated and with what 
diameter tunnels in order to meet the forecast increased demand. 
 
The tunnels can only be drilled in discrete sizes of which 16 options (ranging 
from no duplication to duplication with a tunnel 5.182 m in diameter cover the 
practical sizes available for this problem. In practice this is a small network as the 
distribution system for a large city could contain more than 100,000 pipes. 
Nonetheless the number of options is significant and equals 16 21 or 1.934 x 1025. 
Such networks are usually designed using a trial-and-error procedure whereby the 
engineer chooses a trial design and then uses a hydraulic analysis computer model 
to estimate the pressures throughout the network under the design demand 
conditions. If the pressures are inadequate, some pipe (or tunnel) sizes are 
increased in the model and it is rerun. If the pressures are higher than the minimum 
requirements, some pipe sizes are reduced in the model and it is rerun. Eventually, 
the engineer decides that the design is reasonable i.e. provides the desired 
pressures at a reasonable cost. 
 
Although this is a relatively small network, identification of the minimum 
cost solution is a non-trivial task. For example, if an evaluation of each of the 
1.934 x 1025 solutions required 1 millisecond of computer time, the total run time 
would be 6.13 x 1014 years. This can be compared with the estimated life of the 
universe of 15 x 109 years! In practice of course, engineers can eliminate many of 
the infeasible solutions using experience. Suppose that we can eliminate 99.99% of 
the potential solutions and then enumerate the remaining 0.01%. Unfortunately the 
computer run time will still be 6.13 x 1010 years or 4 times the life of the universe. 
Computer speeds are doubling every 18 months or so. If that trend continues, the 
computer run time to completely enumerate the New York tunnels problem will be 
down to 1 day in about 60 years time. Until that time, we need to rely on other 
techniques to identify optimal or near-optimal solutions to problems like the New 
York Tunnels problem. 
 
It should be noted that the New York water supply system has changed 
considerably since the study by Schaake and Lai in 1969. However, it has been 
used by a number of researchers over the last 48 years as a benchmark problem to 
test their pipe network optimisation routines (Dandy et al., 1996). The best solution 
found so far is that by Maier et al. (2003) using the technique of Ant Colony 
Optimisation. 
Representation of solutions 
Many variants of GAs have been developed over the last 15 years or so. In this 
Section only a simple GA will be considered. A GA operates on a string of 
numbers that represents a set of values of the decision variables. Each string is 
solution to the optimisation problem. By analogy to population genetics, this string 
is sometimes called a chromosome while the individual numbers in the string are 
called genes. 
 
For the New York tunnels problem, the string would consist of 21 integers, 
each one being between 0 and 15 as shown in Figure 13.24.

The first integer in the string represents the size of the duplicate tunnel for 
tunnel # 1, the second integer the duplicate for tunnel #2, and so on. The integers 
are decoded into actual pipe sizes using Table 13.8. Note that the problem has been 
converted into SI units from the original USA customary units of feet and inches.

The solution given by the string in Figure 13.24 therefore represents 
duplicating Tunnel #1 with a tunnel of 1.524 m diameter, duplicating Tunnel #2 
with a tunnel of diameter 4.267 m, not duplicating Tunnel #3, and so on. 
Fitness function 
The objective function in GA optimisation is called the fitness function. GA 
optimisation is usually aimed at maximising the fitness function, so if the problem 
involves minimisation, the fitness function is written as minus the value of the 
objective function or as the inverse of the objective function. The later 
transformation can only be used if the objective function is strictly positive. 
Steps in the GA 
The steps involved in the operation of a simple GA are given below: 
 
1. 
generation of the initial population; 
2. 
computation of the objective function for each solution in the population; 

410 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
3. 
evaluation of the performance of each solution in the population relative to 
the constraints; 
4. 
computation of the  penalty cost for not meeting the constraints; 
5. 
computation of the fitness function for each solution; 
6. 
check for convergence of the population. If convergence has occurred, then 
stop; otherwise continue. 
7. 
selection of a set of parent strings for the next generation; 
8. 
crossover of pairs of parents; and 
9. 
mutation of selected strings. Return to step 2. 
 
 
Each of these steps will be explained in more detail in relation to the New 
York Tunnels problem. Firstly, some additional data are provided for the problem. 
Table 13.9 contains information on the design demands and elevations of each of 
the nodes. 
 
 The design demands are for a future target year, in this case 1994 (25 years 
on from the time of the study). Table 13.10 contains information about the lengths 
and diameters of the existing tunnels in the system (as they were in 1969). 
 
The New York Tunnels system needs to be designed to meet the design 
demands at minimum cost while ensuring that the minimum total heads at all nodes 
(given in Table 13.9) are satisfied. The difference between the total head and the 
elevation at a node is the pressure head at that node. A minimum level of pressure 
head is required to ensure reasonable levels of service for consumers. The total 
heads at each node for any particular design can be computed using a combination 
of the continuity and head loss equations for the system. The details of computing 
the total heads are given in Appendix 13B. The Hazen-Williams coefficient 
(defined in Appendix 13B) for all tunnels is 100.

Optimisation

As this is a minimisation problem and the cost is strictly positive, the fitness 
function used will be the inverse of the total cost. The total cost will be the sum of 
the cost of constructing duplicate tunnels plus the penalty cost (if any) of not 
satisfying the minimum head constraints at nodes. 
 
The steps involved in applying GA optimisation to the New York Tunnels 
problem are described below. 
1. Generation of the initial population. 
As stated previously, a GA works with a population of solutions at any one time. 
The population size is one of the parameters that must be chosen for a GA. It is 
typically in the range 20â1000. The initial population is usually generated 
randomly, so for the New York Tunnels each string would consist of a set of 21 
randomly generated integers in the range 0â15. Each integer would have a 
specified probability of being selected. These probabilities are usually equal, but 
they could be selected to have a bias towards zero (i.e. no duplication) in the case 
of the New York Tunnels.

2. Computation of the objective function for each solution in the population. 
The objective function can be now computed for each solution in the initial 
population. In the case of the New York Tunnels, this equals the cost of the 
solution and can be computed by knowing the diameters of the duplicate tunnels 

412 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
(from the values in the string), their lengths (given in Table 13.10) and the costs 
per unit length (given in Table 13.9). 
 3. Evaluation of the performance of each solution in the population relative to the 
constraints. 
The hydraulic performance of each design can be evaluated by calculating the total 
head at each node in the network by solving the non-linear equations given in 
Appendix 13B using a hydraulic computer model or by other means. 
4. Computation of penalty cost for not meeting the constraints. 
If the total head at any node is below the minimum value (given in Table 13.9) a 
penalty cost is added, for example $16 million per metre of total head below the 
minimum required value. This is an arbitrary high figure chosen to penalise 
solutions that do not satisfy the minimum pressure constraints. If several nodes 
have total heads below the minimum values, the penalty will be based on the node 
with the largest deficit. 
5. Computation of the fitness function for each solution. 
The objective function value (i.e. the cost of the solution computed in step 2) is 
added to the penalty cost (step 4) to give the total cost for each design. The fitness 
function is the inverse of the total cost as this is to be minimised. 
6. Check for convergence of the population. If convergence has occurred, then 
stop; otherwise continue. 
Unlike a number of other optimisation techniques discussed earlier in this Chapter, 
genetic algorithms do not have an easy way of determining if the global optimum 
solution has been achieved. In practice the algorithm is run for a specified number 
of generations or until little improvement is achieved in the best solution over a 
number of generations. If one of these criteria is met, the algorithm is stopped, 
otherwise proceed to step (7). 
7. Selection of a set of parent strings for the next generation. 
By analogy to natural selection, not all solutions will be parents (i.e. produce 
offspring) in the next generation. Using the principle of âsurvival of the fittestâ, the 
GA will select solutions with the highest fitness values to be parents for the next 
generation. A common way to carry out this process is to use tournament selection. 
In tournament selection, two solutions are selected at random from the current 
population, they are compared in terms of their fitness and the string with the 
higher fitness becomes a parent for the next generation. This process is repeated 
(without replacing the first two strings) to give another parent. The process 
continues until all strings have been involved in tournaments. At this stage N/2 
parents have been selected, where N is the population size. The full process is 

Optimisation 
413 
 
carried out a second time starting with the full population from the current 
generation, so that a total of N parents have been identified. 
8. Crossover of pairs of parents. 
Parents are âmatedâ to produce the next generation. This is carried out by 
randomly selecting a pair of parents from the N available. Crossover of the genetic 
material of the parents will occur with a probability pc. A uniformly distributed 
random number between zero and one is selected. If this number is less than or 
equal to pc, crossover occurs and some exchange occurs in the parental genetic 
material passed on to the offspring. This is simulated by determining a point to cut 
the two strings as shown in Figure 13.25(a).  
 
The point at which the strings will be cut is determined randomly. With 21 
numbers (genes) in the string, there are 20 possible places to cut the strings. An 
integer between 1 and 20 is chosen randomly and is used to identify where the 
strings will be cut. The right hand tails are then switched between the two strings. 
Suppose the random number chosen is 11. The offspring strings are shown in 
Figure 13.25(b). 
 
 
 
 
Parent string #1:   [3|12|0|5|0|1|0|0|9| 3 |0|7|5|11|0|2|2|0| 7 |10|0]

(b) 
offspring strings after crossover 
 
Figure 13.25 Crossover of two strings 
 
 
If crossover does not occur, the two offspring strings are identical to their 
parents, so the two parent strings are passed into the next generation. This process 
is repeated for pairs of strings that are selected (without replacement) from the 
parent population, so that a population of offspring strings is formed. 
9. Mutation of selected strings. 
In nature, there is some chance that mutation will occur and the offspring will have 
some genetic differences from their parents. This serves to keep some diversity in 
the population and allows all species to adapt to a changing environment. The GA

process allows some small percentage of strings to mutate every generation. This 
percentage is determined by the GA parameter called the probability of mutation, 
pm. After the crossover process, each string is tested to see if mutation occurs. A 
uniformly distributed random number between zero and one is chosen. If it is less 
than or equal to pm,  mutation occurs. One of the numbers in the string will change 
to a randomly chosen value. The number that mutates is chosen at random by 
selecting an integer random number between one and l (where l = the length of the 
string). The new value is randomly chosen over the range of possible values for 
this location in the string. In the case of the New York Tunnels, the new value will 
be randomly chosen between 0 and 15. Now return to step 2. 
 
Convergence of the GA is illustrated in Figure 13.26 which shows the 
minimum cost solution in each generation. It can be seen from this figure that the 
GA converges rapidly for a start, flattens out and then only improves as a result of 
occasional mutations that identify areas of better solutions.

The solution identified by Dandy et al. (1996) is given in Table 13.11 and has 
a total cost of $38.80 m compared to the original design of Schaake and Lai (1969) 
which had a cost of $78.09 m. Only the tunnels listed in the table are to be 
duplicated. Schaake and Lai (1969) used linear programming to solve the problem 
but this required assumptions to be made about the total head at each node. This 
method is unlikely to lead to the global optimal solution and the Schaake and Lai 
(1969) solution involved much more duplication of tunnels than is necessary. Over 
the years a number of other researchers have applied various optimisation 
techniques to solve this problem. The best solutions have been found using 
evolutionary algorithms such as genetic algorithms and ant colony optimisation.

Choice of GA Parameters 
The following parameters need to be specified for a GA: 
 
ï· 
population size; 
ï· 
probability of crossover; 
ï· 
probability of mutation; 
ï· 
tournament size (which can be more than two); and  
ï· 
maximum number of generations  
 
 
These values need to be chosen based on experience in the particular problem 
regime. Indicative ranges for each parameter are given in Table 13.12.  
 
In addition, penalty costs need to be chosen for each set of constraints. It is 
difficult to give general advice for these values because they depend on the units of 
the objective function and constraints. In general the penalties need to be large 
enough to ensure that the constraints are satisfied, but small enough to ensure that 
the optimum solution can be approached from both the infeasible as well as the 
feasible region. In practice, the GA is usually run a number of times using different 
combinations of parameters and a range of starting seeds for the sequence of 
random numbers and the best overall solution is identified.

13.16 SUMMARY 
Optimisation is a process of attempting to find the âbestâ solution for an 
engineering planning or design problem. The âbestâ solution is the one that best 
achieves the defined objectives for the particular system while satisfying all of the 
constraints. There are a number of approaches to optimisation including subjective, 

416 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
combinatorial and analytical optimisation. Subjective optimisation is based on 
engineering judgement and experience and is used in practice when the problem is 
too complicated to allow combinatorial or analytical methods to be used. 
 
Combinatorial optimisation involves evaluating and comparing all (or a large 
number) of the possible combinations of solutions for a particular problem. 
Complete enumeration of all alternatives can be used when there are a small 
number of possible combinations, otherwise heuristic methods (such as genetic 
algorithms) can be applied to identify near-optimal designs. 
 
Analytical optimisation techniques can be used where the objective(s) and 
constraints for the system can be written in mathematical form. There are a large 
number of techniques that can be used to solve analytical optimisation problems. In 
this text the following techniques have been described in detail: linear 
programming, differential calculus, separable programming and dynamic 
programming. 
 
The choice of the most appropriate optimisation technique to use for a 
particular problem is a skill based on experience and a good knowledge of the 
problem and the available techniques.

It is proposed to install waste treatment plants at each factory so as to reduce 
the maximum waste concentration in the river to 0.002 kg/m3 at all locations. The 
cost of waste removal is $0.30/kg at factory 1 and $0.20/kg at factory 2. A 
maximum of 90% of the waste from either factory can be removed. Waste

Each 1000 m3 of water released through the power station results in the 
generation of 150 kWh of electrical energy, with all of the water passing from the 
turbines into the river downstream of the dam. The net benefit to the community of 
power generation at this site is 10 c/kWh for the first 3000 kWh, 6 c/kWh for the 
next 3000 kWh and 4 c/kWh thereafter (up to a maximum of 15 000 kWh). 
  
Each 1000 m3 of water released for irrigation purposes produces a net benefit 
to the community of $10. In addition, 30% of the water released for irrigation is 
returned to the river downstream of the dam. 
 
The total volume of water available for power generation and irrigation 
purposes is 100 000 m3/day. In order to maintain water quality standards in the 
river downstream of the dam, a minimum flow of 10,000 m3/day must be 
maintained.

THE

OF 
UNCONSTRAINED 
MULTIVARIATE 
OPTIMISATION PROBLEMS 
The necessary and sufficient conditions for an unconstrained multivariate 
optimisation problem are given below. For convenience define X = (x1, x2, . . ., xn), 
then condition 13.55 becomes: 
 
 
Max Z = f(X) 
 
 
 
 
 
(13.85) 
 
 
As in the single-variable problem, differential calculus can be used to solve 
this problem provided f(X) and its first- and second-order partial derivatives exist 
and are continuous for all values of X. 
 
A necessary condition for a particular solution Xo to be a maximum of f(X) 
is: 
 
 
 Â¶f (X)
Â¶x j
= 0
X = X
o
( j =1,...,n) 
 (13.86) 
 
 
The solutions to Equation (13.86) are called stationary points and include 
maxima, minima, points of inflection, and saddlepoints. In order to determine 
which of the stationary points are maxima (or minima) it is necessary to examine 
the second-order partial derivatives of f(X). These are contained in the Hessian 
matrix, H, which is defined as follows: 
 
 
      H =

A sufficient condition for a stationary point, Xo to be a minimum is that the 
Hessian matrix evaluated at Xo is positive definite. For Xo to be a maximum, the 
Hessian matrix evaluated at Xo should be negative definite. 
 
A matrix is positive definite if all of its principal minor determinants  
ï¬k (k = 1, . . ., n) are positive. 
 
The kth principal minor determinant of H is defined as:

APPENDIX 13B: HYDRAULIC ANALYSIS OF PIPE NETWORKS 
This appendix explains how flows and pressure heads are determined in a pipe 
network. It is based on Dandy et al (1993).  
 
Consider a general pipe network with NP pipes, NJ junction nodes (excluding 
fixed grade nodes or reservoirs) and NF fixed grade reservoirs. The following are 
assumed to be known: 
 
1. 
the demands at all nodes (q1, q2, â¦, qNJ); 
2. 
the diameters of all pipes (D1, D2, â¦, DNP); and 
3. 
the total head at one or more nodes (e.g. at fixed grade reservoirs). 
 
 
The total head at each node is the sum of the elevation head and the pressure 
head at the node. It is assumed that velocity heads, minor losses and losses at 
junctions are negligible. The analysis described in this appendix will be a steady 
state analysis assuming that all demands are constant. 
 
The basic unknowns are the discharge in each pipe, (Q1, Q2, â¦, QNP) and the 
total head at each node (H1, H2, â¦, HNJ). The pressure head above ground level at 
each node can be determined by subtracting the elevation of ground level at the 
node from the total head at that node. 
 
The basic equations are:

where the summation is made across the NPJ pipes connected to node i (flow away 
from the node is taken as positive). 
 
 
(ii) the head loss equations: 
 
for pipe j between nodes i and k, the head loss is related to the discharge in the pipe 
as well as its diameter. One head loss equation commonly used in water supply

Equation sets (13.87) and (13.88) provide (NJ + NP) equations in the 
same number of unknowns (pipe discharges and nodal heads). 
 
The number of equations can be reduced by summing the head losses around 
loops and equating the sum to zero or by transposing Equation sets (13.88) to get 
expressions for Qj (j =1,2, â¦NP) in terms of Hi and Hk and then substituting into 
Equation sets (13.87) to eliminate the pipe discharges (Ormsbee and Wood, 1986). 
 
All solution techniques involve the solution of simultaneous non-linear 
equations and may require the use of techniques such as the Newton-Raphson 
method (Shamir and Howard, 1968). 
 


 
 
 
 
CHAPTER FOURTEEN 
 
Epilogue  
 
 
Planning and design are the key activities that are used, together with management, 
to bring engineering projects from the initial concept stage through to successful 
implementation. Our prime goal in preparing this book has been to explain how 
engineering planning and design work is carried out. In the first ten chapters we 
have introduced basic concepts and have described procedures that are used in 
engineering planning and design. In Chapters 11 to 13 we have presented some 
analytic techniques that find frequent use in the detailed phases of planning and 
design.  
 
We are mindful that some of our readers will be students who are just 
commencing their engineering studies. In Chapter 1 we therefore describe the kind 
of work that engineers typically engage in. In brief, we suggest that engineering 
work is concerned with the creation, maintenance and extension of the physical 
infrastructure that modern society needs, in order to function. In Chapter 1 we also 
emphasise that planning and design are similar in nature, and are both problem-
solving activities.  
 
Engineering problems tend to be both complex and open-ended. Open-ended 
problems do not have a single âcorrectâ solution; rather, there is a range of possible 
solutions, so that the aim is not to find the âcorrectâ solution, but rather the âbestâ 
solution. If the problem is very complex, it may not be feasible to find the âbestâ 
solution, and the aim then is to find a relatively âgoodâ solution.  
 
The systems concepts introduced in Chapter 2 provide a means for dealing 
with complexity. A methodology for solving open-ended problems is explained in 
Chapter 3, and this provides the basis for planning and design work. Later chapters 
describe specific procedures that are also useful in planning and design. For 
example, the scheduling techniques described in Chapter 5 help ensure that a 
project is completed on time and within budget. 
 
In engineering work, it is necessary to be able to think creatively and laterally, 
as well as rationally and logically. These contrasting ways of thinking are 
sometimes referred to as right-brain thinking and left-brain thinking. Because of 
their early education, training and background, engineering students today still tend 
to be best suited to tasks that involve analytic thinking and rational analysis. It can 
therefore come as a surprise that they need to develop skills in right-brain thinking, 
in order to be creative. Various aspects of creative thinking are discussed in Chapter 
4, where some techniques for developing right-brain activity are introduced.  
 
Engineering management is far too broad a topic to be covered in any detail 
in this book on planning and design. Nevertheless, in Chapter 6 we deal briefly 
with several aspects of management that are needed when engineering planning 
and design work is undertaken. The skills of self-management, time-management 
and people-management become especially important in the planning and design 

430 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
 
of large, complex projects, when engineers must work in teams, both large and 
small, and with other engineers and specialists from other disciplines.  
 
Other relevant skills are discussed in later chapters. One of the most 
important is the ability to communicate effectively and unambiguously, not only 
with colleagues, but also with clients and with the community at large. In current 
engineering work, clients and other interested parties (the âstakeholdersâ) can take 
a very active part in the relevant decision-making stages of a project. This places 
added demands on the communication skills of engineers, and in particular on their 
ability to explain technical problems to non-experts. The topic of communication is 
introduced in Chapter 7. 
 
Engineers also need to be reasonably familiar with broader areas of 
knowledge such as economics and ethics, law and sociology, and environmental 
matters including sustainability. We have provided brief introductions to these 
areas in Chapters 8, 9 and 10 of this book. Sooner or later, of course, engineers 
encounter unusual problems for which their background knowledge and expertise 
is inadequate. They then have to be able to acquire and absorb new information 
and knowledge rapidly, so that they can communicate with, and work with, experts 
in the appropriate fields. 
 
In all practical engineering work there are inherent risks that have to be 
evaluated and managed. In planning and design, the goal is to create engineering 
systems and processes that are safe and reliable. Chapter 11 introduces the 
concepts of engineering risk and reliability.  
 
Decision-making is an important aspect of planning and design. In each 
phase of an engineering project, many decisions (or choices) have to be made. An 
introduction to mathematical decision making is presented in Chapter 12, not in the 
expectation that the idealised decision models presented will always be directly 
applicable to real situations, but rather with the intention of providing a conceptual 
framework for dealing with real decision problems. This should be of value to 
engineers when they are asked to explain and justify their technical decisions.  
 
Chapter 13 introduces some of the optimisation techniques that are available 
to engineers, including traditional mathematical techniques and modern search 
approaches that are used in association with non-linear and discontinuous 
modelling and computer simulation. Optimisation techniques often find application 
in the detailed phases of planning and design. 
 
There are many specialised design and planning techniques that we have not 
mentioned in this book. These tend to be field-specific and are dealt with in 
undergraduate and post-graduate coursework in many different engineering 
disciplines. However, we have tried to provide a general overview, and a 
framework of ideas, for the discipline-specific methods of planning and design. 
 
New solutions to engineering problems sometimes come from scientific and 
mathematical knowledge via technological innovation. Modern engineering 
developments and innovations also come from ongoing engineering research. While 
there is a strong continuing need for empirical investigation in engineering work, 
the emphasis over many years has tended to be away from the use of empirical ad 
hoc approaches, towards the use of fundamental principles and general concepts. 
The ever-widening scope of engineering analysis is a result of ongoing research and 
an exponential increase in the capacity of computing facilities. There have been 
unparalleled developments in the computational methods of analysis that engineers 

Epilogue 
431 
 
use to create ever-more accurate models of physical systems and to obtain more 
efficient solutions to complex problems of analysis and design.  
 
The history of distance-communication is an interesting example of the 
benefits of research. The earliest communications over long distances were visual: 
bonfires were lit successively on adjacent hills and high vantage points to send 
important (but simple and short) messages across a country, perhaps to announce 
important matters of state. Complex, detailed information had to be transported 
physically, and this was much slower. In the Roman Empire, important government 
documents were transported via the road systems and it could take months for bulky 
documents from Rome to be delivered to the most distant outposts; nevertheless, the 
business of empire was remarkably efficient. But it was not until the discoveries and 
inventions of people such as Hertz, Marconi, Morse and Edison, and more recently 
Claude Shannon, that the rapid and secure transmission of detailed and complex 
information over large distances commenced. Today, after generations of further 
research, and with the development of new areas of knowledge including 
information theory and cryptography, a person today can speak directly and 
privately with someone else located almost anywhere on earth and even in space. 
And it is also possible to transmit, confidentially, enormous amounts of information, 
including complex visual images, sounds, written documents and data files, almost 
anywhere and almost instantaneously, using modern channels of tele-
communication.  
 
Planning and design are not unique to engineering. They form the backbone of 
many diverse professional disciplines, such as architecture, financial planning and 
agricultural economics. For example, architects are involved in planning and design 
when, together with engineers and building contractors, they create new suburbs and 
living areas, shopping centres, retirement villages and multi-function tall buildings. 
Looking more broadly at society, we see a wide range of designed products, such as 
jewellery, fine art, furniture, botanical gardens and zoos, fun parks, entertainment 
centres and innumerable consumer products. What makes engineering planning and 
design unique is the nature of the problems that are dealt with.  
 
We have suggested that engineering work is concerned with the physical 
infrastructure of society, and we have pointed to a close two-way relationship 
between society and its engineering infrastructure. Although the nature of 
engineering work is dictated by the needs of society, the nature of society is itself 
influenced by the engineering solutions to infrastructure problems. This inter-play 
between engineering work and human society is as strong today as it was in 
previous centuries, and in the earliest human civilisations.  
 
Engineers in early civilisations had the task of creating basic infrastructure: 
buildings and fortifications to house and protect the population; clean water for 
drinking, cleaning and for irrigating crops; roads for transport and communication; 
and tools and machines to make manual work more efficient. And the most basic 
needs of our society today have not changed substantially; they still include shelter, 
protection and defence, clean water, systems for handling waste and sewerage, and 
efficient systems for transport and for communications. However, in todayâs 
affluent society the demands for infrastructure are much broader and are continually 
broadening. Manual labour has been largely replaced by machinery in the heavy 
and
 
light industries. Labour-saving devices are to be found everywhere. There 
are washing machines, dishwashers, ceramic stoves, microwave ovens  and air 

432 
Planning and Design of Engineering Systems 
 
 
conditioners in our homes, and computers, printers, shredders, data storage devices 
and other labour-saving equipment in our offices. Year after year these devices 
become more intelligent and smarter, as do the robots in our factories.  
 
However, we now use enormous amounts of energy to drive the innumerable 
devices that replace routine manual labour and to keep our infrastructure operating. 
When the ancient Egyptians constructed their buildings, temples and pyramids, the 
energy they used was derived from the sun and the soil. That energy was supplied 
to the work crews via the bread, beer and meat that they were fed, and it was stored 
for a short time in human muscle. We use vastly more energy today, in our offices, 
factories, homes and automated construction sites, but it still comes largely from 
the sun and the soil, but not via beer, bread and meat. Rather, it comes mainly from 
petroleum, natural gas, and coal, in which solar energy has been stored as potential 
energy over many millions of years.  
 
Our forebears learnt how to run mills by extracting energy from wind and 
flowing water. They also used wind to sail ships around the world. They exploited 
animal muscle, as well as human muscle, and they were innovative in obtaining 
energy from wood-burning fires. Since the Industrial Revolution, however, the 
demand for energy has increased almost exponentially, and every available energy 
source is now being exploited. 
 
Of course, there are many parts of the world that are not âadvancedâ in the 
sense that they use enormous amounts of energy to drive sophisticated engineering 
infrastructure. In much of the world today, poverty is far more common than 
affluence; starvation is a far, far more common problem than obesity. Inequity 
currently takes many forms. Indeed, the world-wide problems of inequity are 
âintractableâ, in the sense that this word was used in Chapter 3. Engineering work 
will certainly be needed to solve the important and difficult problems of inequity, 
but engineering input alone cannot be sufficient. Political and social solutions are 
needed. Engineering input can only become effective after difficult and astute 
political decisions have been taken. 
 
As we come towards the end of this book in which we have discussed the 
nature of engineering, the way engineers undertake their work, and (very briefly) 
the history of engineering, it is natural to think about the future. Although we 
inevitably face unpredictable changes in an uncertain future that will be influenced 
by world events, we can be confident that some things in engineering are unlikely 
to change radically, and there are other things that will change in a more-or-less 
predictable fashion. 
 
 
We can be confident that in fifty and a hundred yearsâ time, engineers will 
still be providing for the basic human needs of most of the worldâs population, 
such as fresh water and shelter in a sustainable environment, and effective systems 
for communication and transport. Engineers may well be required to provide this 
basic infrastructure in new and remote locations, such as in Antarctica, and perhaps 
on the moon and on mars. Extrapolating from the present, we can also be confident 
that improvements to the physical infrastructure will occur progressively in the 
coming decades, as mature components are made obsolete by new, disruptive 
technologies and industries.  
 
Catastrophic events such as earthquakes, floods and tsunamis will continue to 
occur regularly around the world, as at present, and engineers will still be dealing 
with the aftermath of these natural catastrophes for many years to come. Armed 

Epilogue 
433 
 
conflict seems to be inherent in human nature, and brings devastation to the 
physical infrastructure and incalculable loss of life. Sadly, we can expect that 
engineers, into the distant future, will be called on to rebuild, repair and replace 
infrastructure that has been destroyed through conflict.  
 
Unfortunately, armed conflict in the future could be more devastating than at 
present. The effects of nuclear and biological warfare, or perhaps of nuclear and 
biological terrorism, would be horrendous. If all-out nuclear war were to occur, it 
would bring human society back, in the best-case scenario, to a primitive starting 
point, and engineers would then have to re-create the basic infrastructure that 
humans need for survival and comfort. 
 
In thinking about the future, we need to remember that the Earth we inhabit is 
not in stasis: it is not a system that is, or ever was, or ever will be, in a state of 
static and stable equilibrium. It is continually evolving and changing. Even so, 
significant changes seem to occur relatively slowly if judged in terms of the human 
life span. This has led many people to the false impression that we live in an 
unchanging world that can be moulded to our wishes. In fact, our planet is 
currently undergoing accelerating changes that are caused, in part, by our own 
actions, and these changes seem not to be within our control. 
 
The problems we face in regard to changing climate and increasingly scarce 
resources will only intensify in coming decades. Lack of fresh water has long been 
a severe problem in many parts of the world. As nations and regions of the earth 
that are now in poverty become more affluent, competition for scarce resources 
will only increase. Engineers can make a difference by improving the efficiencies 
of procedures for harvesting, using and reusing scarce resources such as water and 
energy. 
 
Scenario planning, which was discussed briefly in Chapter 3, can be used to 
examine and, to a limited extent, plan for possible future events, both favourable 
and unfavourable. When we make extrapolations from the present and the past into 
the future, we find any number of topics in need of scenario planning studies.  
 
Extrapolating from the present, but on a more optimistic note, we can expect 
great benefits to flow on from continuing developments in areas such as medical 
and biomedical engineering. In the longer term, we can expect to see improvements 
that will allow the replacement of most human parts, with longer and happier lives 
for all humans. Artificial intelligence and nanotechnology are at present are in their 
infancy, but applications of these technologies will be positive and spectacular.  
 
Optimistically, we can hope and expect that humans will survive the severe 
adverse events they face in the coming decades and century, and that an improving 
engineered infrastructure will make life not only possible, but enjoyable for most 
humans. In the longer term, the aim must be to achieve a levelling out of the 
worldâs population, to provide adequate food, clean water and basic sanitation for 
all people, with better husbandry of the earthâs resources, and better treatment of 
the environment and other living creatures.  
 
In the immediate future, however, action is urgently needed to curb the 
current over-use of water, energy and other scarce resources. The alternative, of 
trying to meet ever-increasing demands, is simply not feasible. Demand will have 
to be attenuated, and improved efficiencies in the use of scarce resources will have 
to be achieved. This will require a great deal of innovative engineering planning 
and design in the immediate future.
