INTRODUCTION 
These notes can be viewed and used in several different ways, each has 
some justification, a collection of papers, a research monograph or a text 
book. 
The author has lectured variants of several of the chapters several times: 
in University of California, Berkeley, 1978, Ch. III, IV, V in Ohio State Univer- 
sity in Columbus, Ohio 1979, Ch. I,II and in the Hebrew University 1979/80 Ch. 
I, II, III, V, and parts of VI. 
Moreover Azriel I,evi, who has a much better name than the author in 
such matters, made notes from the lectures in the Hebrew University, rewrote 
them, and they .are Chapters I, II and part of III , and were somewhat 
corrected and expanded by D. Drai, R. Grossberg and the author. Also most of 
XI w 
were lectured on and written up by Shai Ben David. 
Also our presentation is quite self-contained. We adopted an approach I 
heard from Baumgartner and may have been used by others: not proving that 
forcing work, rather take axiomatically that it does and go ahead to applying 
it. As a result we assume only knowledge of naive set theory (except some iso- 
lated points later on in the book). The idea of this approach is that otherwise 
when the student learns what is axiomatic set theory and how you can show 
by forcing that CH may fail ( and that CH holds by learning something on L) 
the course is finished. But he has only a vague idea of the rich possibilities in 
forcing, and no idea how to use them. l think the direct approach is more 
appealing. 
Also some other parts were written and rewritten Ch. IV, was written from 
notes of l~ens from the lecture in Berkeley suffered a heavy criticism of a 
referee, and thus was rewritten, 
then Ron Holtzman corrected it and 
expanded it. In Chapter IX, Uri Avraham found various errors, it appeared in 
[Sh 81d] and was revised later. Chapter X appeared in [Sh 81] and was revised 
later. 

Jv 
On the other hand most material was accumulated and not rewritten 
after the author's knowledge expanded (this is the true reason why some cen- 
tral theorems are not immediately proved in the general form, each Chapter 
is in fact a paper, though sometimes with references to previous ones. This 
may serve a didactical purpose. In fact the chapter on the strong covering 
lemma, :Kill and on uniformization properties XIV does not depend on the pre- 
vious chapters (though in XIII the reader has to take on faith theorems 
quoted there). 
Also many chapters were written and circulated as hand written notes in 
various times, and were not changed much. The letter to Wimmers from July 
78 is essentially Chapter IV, the letters from August and September 78 are Ch. 
VII ( w and w167 resp.) the letter from October 78 is Ch. VIII, November 78 is 
Ch. IX. Chapter X was written in the summer 79, and Ch. XI in November 79, 
and Ch. XII were "Notes on forcing, April, 80". 
Chapter XIV has a long history: w grows from a remark on extending [DS] 
in [Sh 1987] w was written up by Rami Grossberg, rewritten by the author 
and then again by Grossberg, who also revised the other sections. 
Still the book is really a research monograph. 
There are few themes dominant to the book: it concentrates on indepen- 
dence results on small uncountable cardinals, by iterated forcing, and try to 
give some general tools in this area. The hope is that someone trying to prove 
such independence results could use them, but it is not intended to someone 
who wants to get independence results using some consistent axioms without 
learning forcing. This research start in [Sh 80] which introduce proper forc- 
ing and oracle c.c. and whose motivation strongly enough was to show some 
restrictions in model theoretic results in the author's book in model theory 
were necessary. 

V 
The last two chapters , XIII, XIV, can stand alone. But in addition to their 
separate interests, they are complementary to the previous ones. The strong 
covering lemma from Ch. XIII, show that it is quite hard to produce non- 
proper (more exactly, non E-proper) forcing notions, so (hard means need 
large cardinals) our preoccupation with them. The work on the uniformiza- 
tion properties serve as a complement to the work on forcing notions not 
adding reals showing the limitations on theorems saying "in a CS iteration 
of each Qi satisfies X, then so does Lim Q~ 
l have mentioned most people's help and I thank them all, in addition I 
thank Baumgartner, Harrington and Magidor for helpful discussions. Wimmers 
for pointing out the problem in a first try of VI w (= Ramsey ultrafilter), Har- 
rington for hearing patiently the proofs while growing. Grossberg for reading 
carefully and correcting many Chapters, and last but not least, Danit Sharon 
for typing the manuscript, Grossberg and Drai for proof reading those notes 
and Gitik for doing the same for several chapters. 
Last remark, l use the privilege of writing lecture notes and not a book, 
to be lazy with references, when not harming the readability: some results are 
attributed to people without the references and some others are called 
"well-known" (and I sincerely think they are). 
As Ch. I,II contains no new 
material we almost have no references and usually do not name the origina- 
tor. 
Also, while working on these notes the author has got more relevant 
results, but had already sworn in July 1981 not to add anything, and they will 
appear in [Sh 1987 d] , so a reader who wants to work on extensions and solu- 
tions is advised to ask for it, and it should exist when these notes will appear.

Notation: Natural numbers are denoted by k ,s ,m ,n and sometimes ~. 
Ordinals are denoted by i,j,a,fi,7,~,~,r 
where 6 is reserved for limit ordi- 
nals. 
Cardinals (usually infinite) are denoted 
by ~,,/~,~,X let ~a be the a-th 
infinite 
cardinal, 
~a = ~a r = co 0. 
Let 
~a = If :fi -* a,f : 
function 
], 
I~>a= (JTa 
For 
sequences 
of 
ordinals 
(i.e., 
members 
of 
some 
~a), 
7<P 
s 
= Dom ~?, n(i) the ith ordinals so n = < ~(i): i < s 
We write also 
<T/(O) ..... 
~/(n)> 
or ~/(0) ..... 
~7(n) as seems fit. 
We denote sequences, 
usually of ordinals, by ~/,v,p and also T. Let c.l.u.b, or club mean closed 
unbounded. 
Let IA [ denote the cardinality of the set A, p(A) denote the power set of 
A, and cf (a) the cofinality of a. 
A real means here a subset of e~, or its characteristic functions. 
Let ~Ab denote first order formulas, ~(x 0 ..... 
xn_l), means every free 
variable of ~ appear in Ix 0 ..... 
xn_ll. 
Let P ( and also Q and R) denote poset, i.e., a partially ordered set or 
even a quasi ordered set (i.e., p ~ q -< p does not necessarily imply p = q). 
We call such P a forcing notion, and assume ~b is a minimal member of P. We 
use G for a generic subset of P, (usually G a for a generic subset of Pc), (for 
definition of generic see I w 
Let p,q,r 
denote members of forcing notions, 
we sayp ,q are incompatible in P if they have no common upper bound in P. 
We do not distinguish strictly between a model M or a poset P and their 
universe, 
x A~ is the cartesian product sometimes also denoted by HEzA ~, dis- 
~I 
tinguish it from I~E]~(i ) (multiplication of cardinals). 
We shall not distinguish 

vll 
between multiplication of cardinals or ordinals. For an uncountable cardinal 
A whose co finality > S O D a stand for the filter generated by the closed 
unbounded subsets of A; When S G A is stationary (also denoted by 
ST0mod 
DA) 
D A + S is the filter generated by D A O iS]. 
Let a,fi be ordinals such that fi < a then S~ = iT < Ma : ef T = ~p] but when ~z,A 
are cardinals such that $$ < A then S~ = IT < A : ef k = M]. 
We made a special effort to uniformize the notation we use but still there 
maybe some exceptions in the chapters, for example in chapter III SM(A ) is 
used to denote the family of countable subsets of A (see Definition III 1.2 ) 
but the same family in chapter V is denoted by 
S<M (A) (see Definition V 3.3 
I 
). SO since some of the notions are redefined the reader is advised to check 
the nearest definition and not the first. 
~odels are denoted by the letters M,N perhaps with an index we shall not 
always distinguish between the model and its universe, but always ]M] will 
denote the universe of/d and [] M ]] its cardinality.

CONTENT BY SUBJECT 
I. Results outside Set Theory 
In Chapter XIV, section 2 there are results on the power of Ext(G,Z) 
assuming various weak diamonds. 
2. Results in naive Set theory 
In XIII w we prove that (I~6)cf ~ < l~(l#lot~)~ for every limit ordinal ~ (includ- 
ing cf 6 = l~0). In XIII w more information and problems are discussed, and 
XIII. w tell the history of the singular cardinal problem. 
In XIV w we investigate weak variants of the diamond (continuing Devlin 
and Shelah [DS].) 
In XIV w we prove that CH implies some kind of weak diamond to SI 2 . 
In IX w we discuss various specializations of Aronszajn trees. 
3. Other non forcing results 
In XIII w 
w 
w we deal with the strong covering lemma, and its applica- 
tions to the value of 2 I% in V[r ]. 
4. Basics of Forcing 
In Ch. l we explain how to use forcing and discuss some basic forcing. In 
Ch. lI we explain iteration with < z-support, (in particular finite support) deal 
for example with Martin Axiom, and more examples. 
5. Specific Independence results on trees 
In III 5.4 we present a proof that every l~ffAronszajn tree can be special- 
ized by a c.c.c, forcing notions (and generally in III w deal with z-trees). 

ix 
In III w we present a proof of the consistency of "ZFC + 2 t% = ~a + there 
is no #2-Aronszajn trees." 
In V w 
w we prove CON (ZFC + G.C.H. + every Aronszajn tree is special.) 
In VII w F we prove consistency results on Aronszajn trees strengthening 
the previous ones, motivated by general topology. 
In VII w G we present a proof of the consistency of a strengthening of 
CON (ZFC + G.C.H. + there is no ~l-Kurepa tree.) 
6. Theorem on ~ I- complete forcing 
In VIII w 
we prove that we can iterate ~-complete 
forcing and ~1" 
complete forcing satisfying a strong ~2-chain condition, with collapsing B1 and 
In VIII 27A we remark on another strong ~2-chain condition preserved by 
CS iterations. 
7. Chain conditions 
The c.c.c and ~-c.c.c. are introduced in II and the preservation of the 
c.c.c, by FS is proved there. 
In III 4.1 we prove that a CS iteration of proper forcing notions of power 
< ~, 
~ regular (u 
< r) ~0 < ~, of length ~ satisfies the ~-c.c. (by proving 
that if the length is < r, it has a dense subset < ~). 
Of course IV is dedicated to oracle c.c. 
Lemma V 1.5 proves the t~2-c.c, of a CS iteation of E-complete forcing 
notions each of power ~1- (assuming CH). 
In VII w deals with a strong r-chain condition (e.c.c.) similar to the one 
from [Sh 78a], such that if we have a CS iteration of length ~ with the condi- 
tions we use for not adding reals (in u w 
VIII w 
then the forcing satisfies 

the g-c.c. So this helps to get consistency results with ZFC + CH. 
In VII w we deal with z-T/c (= ~-properness isomorphism conditions). If 
P satisfies it, then P satisfies by ~-c.c., and add < ~ reals, and an iteration of 
length ~ still satisfies the ~-c.c. 
It helps to get consistency results with 
ZFC+2 t%=t~ 2+21%=~, (so we start with E]="CH+2 
~'=K;''and this holds 
for the intermediate stages), application is starting with V ~ "CH § 2 ~1 = to" 
and use a CS iteration Q = (Pi,Qi: i < co2> 
Qi specialize all Aronszajn trees 
without adding reals. 
On the ~-c.c. for RCS iteration of length ~ see X w ( 5.3, 5.4) and XI 6.3 
(2). 
8. Preservation of properness and variants 
As the book was written in the generic way, there are several such proofs. 
In III w the preservation of properness by CS iteration is proved. In IX w the 
preservation of properness under t~l-free limit is proved. In X w the preser- 
vation of properness and semi-properness under RCS is proved. (remember 
that semi-proper forcing may change the cofinality of some regular ~, > t~ 1 to 
~). In XII w the preservation of properness under CS iteration is reproved, 
using the definition of properness by games. 
We deal with preservation of a-properness and (~,l)-properness in V w 
w 
x w 
Ill VIII w we prove the consistency of ZFC + CH + SH § 2 ~1 > ~2. 
In IX w we prove of that SH =~ "every Aronszajn tree is special". 
9. Consistency results on the nniformization properties are variant 
In II w we prove the consistency of "some family of M1 subsets of ~ have 
the uniformization properties" 
]n V w we prove the consistency with GCH "of for some stationary S c ~l, 
(A~ : ~ < wl> have the uniformization property if each A6is a set of order 
type ~, 
Sup (A~) = ~." 

XI 
In VIII w we prove the consistency with G.C.H. of 
s 
10. Other consistency results 
In III w 
we deal with "for a family of I~ I countable subsets At of 
~I (i < ~i), 
order 
type 
(A~) c Sup A t, 
there 
is 
a 
club 
Cc~ 1 A 
Sup(CNAt) 
CSupAt. 
In VI w we prove the consistency of "there is no P-point". 
In VI w we prove the consistency of "there is no Ramsey ultrafilter". 
In X, XI we prove various independence results on ~e, read XI w X 8.4, and 
XI w 
theorem. 
In VII w 
w many applications are listed. 
11. Other preservation of properness 
In V w we prove the preservation of t~-properness + the ~~ 
pro- 
perty. 
In VI w and X w we deal with preservation of covering model, hence of 
various properties which can be formulated this way (Sacks property, Laver 
property, PP-property, D generates a Ramsey ultrafilter, D generates a P- 
point (ultrafilter)). 
In IX w we deal with the preservation of "(T',S)-preserving" which means 
T" look like Souslin trees at levels t~ Ill S, and in the end we comment on pos- 
sible generalizations. 
Not adding reals is dealt with in Y w I, w 
and mainly V w VIII w and X w 
In V w 
and X w we deal with preservation of generalizations of S l- 
completeness. 
In XI w 
w we deal with the preservation of the S-condition (always 
satisfied by Nm' which change the eofinality of I~ a to M 0 but guarantees reals 

xJ] 
are not added) and in XII w with a generalization including proper forcings. 
12. Examples 
In VII w we build of iteration <P~,r 
:~1 < ~> such that each Q 
does 
not collapse any stationary subset of ~I; but any limit we take collapse S I. 
In III w we build (in ZFC) a forcing notion of power ~1, not collapsing MI 
but also not preserving the stationarity of some S c ~l- 
Examples of iteration <P~,Q 
: • < co> each Q 
is a-proper for each a 
N n 
~ 
not adding reals, but any limit we take collapse M1 is presented in ~/8.1 using 
XIV w ( really the previous result of Dev]Lin and Shelah [DS]). 
In XII w we show that many forcing notions satisfy the conditions from XI 
but are not semi-proper. In fact if there is an iSl~-semi proper forcing notion 
changing the cofinality of Sl to M0 then Chang conjecture holds.

I FORCING, BASIC FACTS 
w Introducing forcing 
1.1 Discussion: Our basic assumption is that the set theory ZFC is con- 
sistent. By Godel's completeness theorem it has a countable model. We make 
the following further assumptions about this model. 
(a) The membership relation of the model is the real membership rela- 
tion; and therefore the model is of the form < V,c>. 
(b) 
The 
universe 
V 
of 
the 
model 
is 
a 
transitive 
set, 
i.e., 
x Ey EV--*x E V. 
Assumptions (a) and (b) are not essential but it is customary to assume 
them, and they simplify the presentation. So "V a model of ZFC ': will mean 
"a countable model of ZFC satisfying (a) and (b)" , and the letter V is used 
exclusively for such models. 
Cohen's forcing method is a method of extending V to another model V t 
of ZFC. It is obvious that whatever holds in the model V t cannot be refuted by 
a proof from the axioms of ZFC, and therefore it is compatible with ZFC. If we 
show that a statement and its negation are both compatible with ZFC then we 
know that the statement is undecidable in ZFC. 
Why do we look at extensions of V and not at submodels of V? After all, 
looking at subsets is easier since their members are already at hand: To 
answer this question we have to mention Godel's constructibility. The con- 
structible sets are the sets which must be in a universe of set theory once the 
ordinals of that universe are there. Godel showed that the class L of the con- 
structible sets is a model of ZFC and that one cannot prove in ZFC that there 
are any sets which are not constructible. Therefore, for all we know, V con- 
tains only sets which are constructible and in this case every transitive 

subclass l et of V which contains all. ordinals of V and which is a model of ZFC 
must coincide with V, and therefore it gives us nothing new. 
1.2 Discu~mion: Now we come to the concept of forcing. We start with a 
poser (partially ordered set) P in V. We want to add to V a subset G of P as 
follows. 
(l) G is directed (i.e., every two members of G have an upper 
bound in G) and downward closed (i.e., if z ~ y E G then also x E G). 
Trivial examples of a set G which satisfies (1) is the empty set ~b and 
Ix Ix ":pJ for p c P. 
The following should be taken as a declaration of intent rather than an 
exactly formulated requirement. 
(2) We want that G 1~ V and moreover G is "general" or "ran- 
dom" or "without any special property". 
We aim at constructing a set V[G] which is a model of ZFC with the same 
ordinals as V, such that V C V[G] and G c V[G], and which is minimal among 
the sets which satisfy these requirements. 
So we can look at P as a set of approximations to G, each p E P giving 
some information on G, and j0 -~ q means q gives more information; this view 
is helpful in constructing suitable forcing notions. 
Where does the main problem in constructing such a set V[G] lie? In the 
universe of set theory the ordinals of V are countable ordinals since V itself 
is countable. But an ordinal of V may be uncountable from the point of view 
of V (since V is a model of ZFC and the existence of uncountable ordinals is 
provable in ZFC). 
Since for each ordinal a ~ V the information that a is 
countably is available outside V. G may contain that information for each 
a ~ V. In this ease every ordinal of V (and hence of V[G]) is countable in 

3 
V[ G] and thus V[ G] cannot be a model of ZFC. How do we avoid this danger? 
By choosing G to be "random" we make sure that it does not contain all that 
information. 
While we choose a "random" G we do not aim for a random V[G], but we 
want to construct a V[G] with very definite properties. 
Therefore we can 
regard p as the assertion that p 9 G and as such p provides some informa- 
tion about G. All the members of G, taken together, give the complete infor- 
mation about G. 
Now we come back to the second requirement of G and we want to replace 
the nebulous requirement above by a strict mathematical requirement. 
1.3 Definition: (1) A subset ~) of P is said to be a dense subset of P if it 
satisfies 
(vp e P)(',q e P)(p < q ^ q e D) 
(~) Call D C P open (or upward closed) if for everyp,q e P 
p >_q^q e~:::::~p e_~) 
1.4. Discussion: Since we want G to contain as many members of P as 
possible without contradicting the requirement that it be directed we require. 
(2)' G N ~) ~ ~ for every dense open subset ~) of P which is in 
V. 
A subset G of P which satisfies requirements (1) and (2)' is called generic 
over V ( we usually omit V), where this adjective means that G satisfies no 
special conditions in addition to those it has to satisfy. The forcing theorem 
will assert that for a generic G,V[G] is as we intended it to be. 
Does (2)' imply that G Jg V? Not without a further assumption, since if P 
consists of a single member p then G = ~p~ satisfies (I) and (2)' and G e V. 
However if we assume that P has no trivial branch, in the sense that above 

every member of P there are two incompatible members, then indeed G r V. 
To prove this notice that if G r V. Then P-G is a dense subset of P in V, and 
by (2)' we would have G ("l (P-G) r r 
which is a contradiction. 
1.5 The Forcing theorem, version ~2 (1) If G is a generic subset of P 
then there is a set V[G] which is a model of ZFC, V ~ V[G], G e V[G] and V 
and V[G] have the same ordinals. 
(2) P has a generic subset G, moreover for every p C P there is 
a G ~ P generic over V,p e G. 
1.6 Discussion: We shall not prove (1), but we shall prove (2). Since V is 
countable P has at most t~ 0 dense subsets in V; let us denote them with 
~)0,~)1,~)2, "'" we shall construct by induction a sequence ion. We take an 
arbitrary P0- We choose Pn+l so that Pn ---P,~+I c ~)n; this is possible since 
~ 
is dense. We take G = [q e P : :]n(q <pn){. It is easy to check that this G 
is generic. 
Since we want to prove theorems about V[G] we want to know what is the 
composition of the members of V[G]. We cannot have in V full knowledge of 
the members of all members of V[G] since this would cause these sets to 
belong to V. So we have to agree that we do not know the composition of G, 
but except for that we have in V full knowledge of all members of V[G], V 
contains a prescription for building that member out of G. We shall call these 
prescriptions "names". We shall be guided in the construction of the names 
by the idea that V[G] contain only those members that it has to. 
Remember: 
1.7 Definition: We define the rank of any a 6 V: 
(note if a = ~,~k(a) = 0), the union of a set of ordinals is an ordinal, hence 
~'k(a) is an ordinal if defined, and by the axiom of regularly ~'/c(a) is defined 
for every a. So 

5 
1.8 Definition: We define what is a P-name (or name for P or a name in 
P) T of rank .: a, and what is its interpretation 
T[G]. If P is clear we omit it. 
This is done by induction on a. 
~r is a name of rank ~ a if it has the form T = [(p~.~-~):i < ia|, pc c P and 
each T~ is a name of some rank < a. 
The interpretation 
T[G] of T is lr~[G] " pi c G,i < io| 
1.9 Definition: (1) Let vkn(T ) = a if T is a name (for some P) of rank < a 
but not a name of rankle for any fl < a. 
(~) For a 9 V and forcing notion P, a is a P-name 
defined by 
induction on r/c (a); 
N 
(3) G = I(P,P):P 9 P| (when necessary we denote it by (Gp). 
(4) rk r (~r), the revised rank of a P-name T is defined as follows: 
rk r(T) =0iff~r=aforsomea 
9 V 
Otherwise 
rkr(T ) = UIrkr(U ) + l:(p,a) 9 Tfor somep] 
Remark: In spite of 1.9(2), we use f,a etc. to denote P-names 
not 
necessarily of this form. 
1.10 Claim= Given a forcing notion P, and G ~ P generic over V 
(1) rkn(r ) -- rlar (T[G]) for any P-name. 
(E) for a 9 V. a[G] = a 
(3) ~a] = a. 

(4) r/c r (T) , rk n (T) are well defined ordinals, for any P-name T. 
Proof: Trivial. 
1.11 Discussion: Notice that while every name belongs to V the values of 
the names are not necessarily in V since the value of a name cannot be car- 
ried out in V. It turns out that these names are sufficient in the sense that 
the set of their values is a set V[G] as required: 
1.12 The Forcing theorem (strengthened) version B. In version A, in 
addition V[G] = IT[G] : T C V,T a P-name ]. 
We want to know which properties hold in V[G] . The properties we are 
interested in are the first order properties of V[G], i.e., the properties given 
by formulas of the predicate calculus. We shall refer to the members of V[G] 
by their names so we shall substitute the names in the formulas. 
1.13 
Definition: 
If 
r 1 ..... 
Tn 
are 
names, 
for 
the 
poset 
P, 
~(x 1 ..... 
xn) a first-order formula of the language of set theory with an 
additional unary predicate for V, then we writep 
][-p ~(T 1 .....

~o(T 1 ..... 
Tn) for the forcing P) if for every generic subset G of P which 
containsp 
~0(TI[G ] ..... 
Tn[G]) is true in V[G]. 
The Forcing theorem, version C: If G is a generic subset of P then for 
every 
~(T 1 ..... 
Tn) 
as 
above 
there 
is 
a 
p e G

Therefore

some 
p 
C C 
P 
 (T1 ..... 
Moreover I]- (as a relation) is definable in V. 
This is finally the version we shall actually use, but we shall not prove this 
theorem either. 
The forcing relation ]~-e clearly depends on P. If we deal with a fixed P 

we can drop the subscript P. We refer to P as the forcing r~o~ion. 
The rest of the section is devoted to technical lemmas which will help to 
use the forcing theorem. 
1.15 Definition: Forp,q 
e P we say thatp 
and q are compatible if they 
have an upper bound..9 
C P is an antichain if every two members of .~ are 
incompatible..9 C P is a maximal ar~tichain if .9 is an antichain and there is 
no antichain ~ C P which properly includes .9. We say .9 c P is predense 
(above p c P) if for every q e P 
(q m p) some qt e .9 is compatible with q. 
1.16 Lemma: Let G be a downward closed subset of P. G is generic iff 
for every maximal antichain .9 c V ] G V~ -91 = 1. 
Proof: Suppose G is generic. Since G is directed it cannot contain two 
incompatible 
members 
and 
hence 
I G • ~q] -- 1. 
Given 
.9 ~ V 
let 
~) = [iv c P : (:~q E ~)p -- q | E V, i.e., ~) is the upward closure of .9. D is obvi- 
ously upward closed, we shall now show that D is dense . For any r c P r is 
compatible with some member q 
of .9 (otherwise .9 (J It| 
would be an 
antichain properly including the maximal antichain .9), let p --~ r,q. Then, by 
the definition of ~, p c ~) and we have proved the density of ~). Since ~ is 
dense G C~D#r

Now assume that for every maximal antichain .9 E V I G V~-~l = 1. First 
let D c V be a dense subset of P and we shall prove G N D ~ 0. By Zorn's 
lemma there is an antiehain .9 C D which is maximal among the antichains in 
~, 
We claim that ~ is a maximal antichain. Let r c P, we have to prove that 
r is compatible with some member of .9 (and hence ~ cannot be extended to 
an antichain). Since ~) is dense there is a p • ~ p -~ r. Since p E ~ and .9 is 
an antichain maximal in D p is compatible with some member q of .9, then v 
is also compatible with q. We have thus [ G C~ -~] = 1 hence G V~ ~) ~ ~ # ~b.

The consistency of CH (the Continuum Hypothesis). 
Usually the consistency of CH, i.e., of 2 ~~ = ~1, is proved by showing that it 
holds in L (the class of constructible sets) but we do not want to go in this 
way. So 
2.1 Theoremc I~Iodel & There is a model of ZFC in which ~0 = ~1- 
Proof: Let us first review the main points of the construction of the 
model. We start with a countable transitive model V of ZFC in which ~0 is 
either ~1 or greater. We shall extend it to a model V[G] in which G will essen- 
tially be a counting of length ~1 of all sets of natural numbers. Each condi- 
tion, i.e., each member of P, is an approximation of the generic object G and 
therefore will consist of partial information about the counting. Since every 
two members of G are compatible, the members of G, taken together, yield a 
counting of subsets of ~. The three things about which we have to worry in 
the proof are the following: 

10 
a) How do we know that every subset a of ~ in V will occur in the count- 
ing given by G? 
This will be answered by showing that the set of all partial countings in 
which a occurs is a dense subset of P, and hence G contains such a partial 
counting. 
b) How will the new subsets of ~, i.e., the subset of ~ which are in V[G] 
but not in V, be counted when the members of P, being in V, can count only 
subsets of ~ which are in V? 
Here we shall make sure that V[G] contains no new subsets of ~. 
c) Is t~ 1 of V, which we have mapped on the set of all subsets of G0 in V[G] 
also the #l of V[G]? 
Here the answer is easily positive because 
V and V[G] have the same sets 
of natural numbers. 
In V[G] we want to obtain a function g from l~il'[c](Sil'[c] denotes the ordi- 
nal which is the I~ I of V[G]o i.e., the least ordinal a such that V[G] does not 
contain a mapping of ~ onto a) onto/~o)IZ[G](~o) is the power set of ~ and 
the superscript V[G] means that/~)vIG] is the power set of ~ in V[G]). It 
will turn out that MI I~G] =MI V, and the only subsets of ~ available in V[G] are 
the members of ~t~) v. Therefore partial information about g is given by 
functions from countable ordinals into p(o) in V. Thus we define P = ~f : 2' 
is a function on a countable ordinal into/~)] where the definition is inside 
V. A member 2' of P is understood to "claim" that g is like f on the domain 
of f. When does a member J't of P give us more informat{on that J'? When 
2' c fi Therefore we take the partial order < on P to be proper inclusion. 
Let G be a generic subset of P. By the definition of the concept of a gen- 
eric 
object 
every 
two 
members 
of 
G 
are 
compatible, 
hence 
U G = [J|f:f 9 G] is a function, we shall denote it with fG- The domain of 

11 
9to is the union of the domains of the members of G and hence it is a union of 
ordinals 
< ~v and therefore 
the domain of fa 
is an ordinal 
-~v 
If A is a 
countable 
set in V then in V there is a function r on r onto A. Since V is a 
transitive set, V contains already all the objects which are members 
of A in 
the universe and hence A has no new members 
in V[G]. V[G] has the same 
set c0 of natural numbers as V and therefore r maps ~ on A also in V[G] and 
A is countable in V[G]. In particular every ordinal which is countable in V is 
also countable in V[G]. Therefore, since ~Vis uncountable 
in V[G] then ~Vis 
the least ordinal which is uncountable 
in V[G], i.e., ~v= ~lv[c]. If ~Vis count- 
ably in V[G] then ~v<~lv[a], hence in either case ~v~G]. 
Therefore the 
domain of fa is an ordinal ~ t~lv[c] (since itis <t~. 
We have in fact deal with 
2.2 Definition: A first order formula ~(x) (in the language of set theory) 
is absolute if when V C Vt are models of ZFC with the same ordinals, a c V, 
then 
V ~ ~[a] iff V t ~ ~[a]. 
Note that properties 
and function 
are inter- 
preted by first order formulas. 
Obviously: 
2.3 Lemma: The following are absolute: "a an ordinal " , " a not an ordi- 
nal .... a is [not] a natural number", " a = n" , "a = ~", "a is a not a cardinal", 
"a is not regular ", "A has power < a" . "A C t?", "A ~ B", "f [is not] a [one- 
to-one] function from A to [onto] B". 
In fact any relation (function, property) defined by a ~1 - formula, i.e., by 
(~y)~(z o ..... 
xn_l,zn,y ) when ~ has only bounded 
quantifiers 
i.e., of the 
form (u 
1 E z2),(bz 1 E z2) is absolute . We have now to prove the following 
facts. 
2.4 Fact A= Every A ~ p(~)v is in the range of fG. 
Fact B: 
= p( 
)v 

12 
Once these facts are proved we know that the range of fG is p(~)v[c] and in 
V[G] J'G maps an ordinal ~ t~ 1 onto/9(~) hence in V[G] ]~w) has at most t~ 1 
subsets, which establishes 2 ~ = B1 in V[G]. 
Remember that a subset ~ of P is said to be pve-dense in P if every member 
io of P is compatible with some member of ~. In particular,~ is pre-dense if 
~) is a maximal antichain or if D is such that for every p in P there is a 
q ~suchthatq-~p. 
Proof of Fact A: Let A e/9(~)v; we want to prove that A e Rang (f6), 
i.e., for some f C G A ~ Rang (f), or, in other words 
G (~ lY cP:A 
oRang(f)] 
#r 
For this purpose it suffices to show bhat the 
set D = if c P : A c Rang (f)~ is dense, since this set is obviously in V. 
Let p c P then p :a -~ ]9(~0) in V, where a is a countable ordinal. Let j' be the 
function on a+l , which is also a countable ordinal in V, into ]9(~)v given by 
f(8) =p(~) for ~<a 
and f(a) =A. Clearly f cP,f ~p andf 
cD. 
ThusD 
is dense and Fact A is established. 
Now Fact B will follow from 2.7, 2.8 below, thus completing the proof of 
theorem 2.1. 
2.6 Definition: A poser P is said to be t~ 1- complete, or countably com- 
plete if every increasing (by <- ) sequence (pn:n < ~) of members of P, i.e., 
every sequence ~Pn :n <c0> such that P0~Pl<-P2 
-< "'', 
has an upper 
boundp in P (i.e.,p -~Pn for every n c ~). 
2.7 Lelimm: Our present set P is countably complete in V. 
Proof: Let ~Pn : ~ < ~) be a non-descending sequence of members of 
P in V. Since the Pn'S are pairwise compatible p = d P~ is a function. The 
domain of p is the union of the domains of the pn's. Thus the domain of p is 
a countable union of countable ordinals, and is therefore a countable ordinal. 
The range of p is the union of the ranges of the pn's and it consists therefore 
of members of p(o)v. 
Thusp ~ P, and obviouslyp > Pn for every n < ~. 

13 
2.8 Theorem: For every countably complete forcing notion P in V and 
every generic subset G of P, V[G] contains no new w-sequence of members of 
V, 
i.e., 
if 
<a~ :n c w> ~ V[G] 
and 
a~ c V 
for 
r~ <w 
then 
also 
(a m :n <c0> c V. In particular if fora 
cwa 
~ V[G]thenalsoa 
c Y. 
Proof: Let <an'~ 
C~> C FIG], then <an:n 
cw) 
has a name 7. By 
the forcing theorem there is a q E G such that g I~-"7 is an w-sequence of 
members of V': We shall prove that the subset ~p c P :p []- "T C V" I of P is 
pre-dense above q and therefore G contains a p such thatp 
[[-"7 c V" and 
therefore 7[G] E V, i.e., <an'n 
<w> c Vis true in V[G]. Here we use the 
fact that ~p ~ P: p ]t-"T c V"] is in V; this is the case since forcing is 
definable in V. 
Let us prove now that D = iP ci~ p ]~ "-r c V") is pre-dense 
above q. 
Let qt_~ q "knows" that every a m is in V, since already q forces this claim, but 
even qt does not necessarily "know" the identity of a m. We shall see that we 
can extend qt to a condition which "knows" a 1, then to a condition which 
"knows" a 2, and so on, and as a consequence of the countably completeness 
of P, qt can be finally extended to a condition p which "knows" all the an's . 
This will imply p "knows" that ~ a n : n < w) is some particular member of V, 
andp 
][- "~- c V': which establishes the pre-density of D above q. 
We define 
a 
sequence 
(p~ :~z < co> 
of conditions 
and a 
sequence 
4am : ~ < w) of members of V as follows. Let us mention now that the forth- 
coming definition is carried out entirely within V and therefore the obtained 
sequences are members of V. We set P0 = q*- For n _~ 0 we choose P~+I and 
a~ so that Pn+l -=*Pn and Pn+l I[-"T(r~) = a 
" where T(n) = a m is an abbrevi- 
Nn 
ation of "the rL-th term of the sequence T is a m ". Do such Pn+l and a m exist? 
to prove their existence we go out of V, but this does not matter since once 
we know they exist the definition proceeds entirely within V. Let G t be any 
generic subset which contains pn. 
In ViGil 
T[G t] is an ~-sequence 
of members of V, since q ~Pn c G? and 
q I[-"T is an c0-sequence of members of V': Let a m be the n-th term of the 

14 
sequence T[Gt], then a n c V and T[Gt](n) = a n is true in V[Gt]. By the forc- 
ing theorem 
there is an r c G t such that r I~-"T(n) =a 
" Since r,pn c G ? 
they are compatible. 
Choose Pn+l ~ r,Pn then also Pn+l II- "T(n) = a 
': and 
~n 
Pn+l and a n are as required. 
In order to choose a definite Pn+l in P we 
assume that we have some fixed well ordering of P in V and Pn+l is chosen to 
be the least member of P in that well-ordering for which there exists an a n so 
that P~+I ~Pn 
and P~+1 ]~-"T(n) : a 
" 
a n is uniquely determined 
by P~+t 
~n 
since if also for some b r a n Pn+l II-"T(n) = b" then for every generic Gt 
which contains Pn+l we have that the n-th 
term of T[Gt] is both a~ and b, 
which is impossible. 
Since P is countably 
complete ther is a p c P such that p ~pn 
for all 
n <~. 
We have, obviously p raP0 =qt 
and for every n <~ 
p ~Pn+l 
and 
hence p 
I~-"T(n) = an". 
Thus for every generic subset 
G t of P which con- 
tains p T[G t] is an c0-sequence and T[Gt](n) = a n for every n c ~, h.ence 
T[G t] : (aw :n < c0~ E V (~an :n <co) c Vsince this sequence was defined 
in V). By the definition of the forcing we have p 
I~- "T c V'" which is what we 
had to prove. 
If a c V[G], a C ~ then let ~ an: n < ~ 
be the characteristic 
functon o[ 
a. Since each a n is 0 or 1 (a n : n < ~ 
is a sequence 
of members 
of V and 
hence, 
by the 
present 
theorem 
(a~:n

be easily 
obtained from (a~

On the consistency of the failure of CH 
We first prove a technical lemma, and then prove that 2 s~ = ~,, is possible 
for almost any a. 
3.1 The existantial 
completeness 
Lemma: If P0 I~-p "(3z)~a(z)" then 
there is a name T such that P0 I~-P ~(T), where F(x) is a formula which may 

15 
mention 
names. 
Moreover 
Ike 
and 
Proof: The idea of the proof is as follows. The condition P0, "knows" 
that ('~x)~(x) but this does not tell us directly that P0 knows the name of a 
particular set x which satisfies 9(x). However with more information than 
that in P0 we know names of sets which satisfy ~(x). What we have to do is to 
combine the various names to a single name which equals each of those 
names just when the name satisfies ~(x). 
Let 2) = Iq : q Ikp 
or for some name 
q Ikz 
D 
is 
defined in V, hence ~) E V. We shall now see that ~ is pre-dense (it is even 
dense). Let r c P, but r does not force -(2x)9(x). Then there is a generic 
G C P such that r E G, and V[G] ~ "(3x)9(x)'" by r's choice. Since every 
member of V[G] is the value of some name we have V[G] ~ "9(T[G])" for 
some P-name T. 
By the forcing theorem there is an r? c G 
such that 
rt II-e "9(T) ". Since G is directed and r c G without loss of generality rt_~ r 
and by definition, rt E ~). Now if r ]~-p "~(3x)~(x) '" trivially r c ~) . Thus we 
have shown that ~) is pre-dense. Let .9 be a maximal subset of D of pairwise 
incompatible members. We shall see that also ~ is pre-dense. Let q c P and 
suppose, in order to obtain a contradiction, that q is incompatible with every 
member of .9. By what we proved about D there is a q? E ~) qt > q. Also qt is, 
clearly incompatible with every member of .9. Now .9 U Iqt] is a subset of 
of pairwise incompatible members which properly includes .9, which contrad- 
icts our choice of .~. 
Let .9 = iq~ : i < a], since .9 ~ ~) there is for every i < a a name T~ such 
that q~ ]~-p "9(T~)"or g~ I~-p "~(3x)9(x)". Let T be the name 
{T~ 
if q~ II-e "~(~r 
lr = 
~ 
otherwise 
which we have proved to exist (1.19) for pairwise incompatible qt's. We claim 
that P0 ]~ "~(T)". To prove that let G be a generic subset of P andSIp0 c G. 
Since ~ is pre-dense we have G ~ I # ~b and hence for some i < a qi c G. if 

16 
~-~ is not defined qi ][-p "~(~x)~(x)", but then qi,.Po are incompatible, 
but 
both are in G. So q~ 1[-"9(wi)" hence we have V[G] ~ 9(n[G]). 
Also since 
q~ 9 G we have, by the defintion of w, r[G] = T~[G], hence V[G] ~ 9(r[G]), 
which establishes P0 ]~- T(~). 
The second assertion in the lemma is clear too. 
3.2 Theorem= Model B: There 
is a model 
in which the 
continuum 
hypothesis fails. Moreover, for every cardinal X there is a poset P such that 
]~-p "2 s~ > X and every cardinal of V is a cardinal (of V[G])). 
Convention: We use the word "real" as meaning 
a subset of r 
or its 
characteristic 
function. 
Proof: We want to add to V 
k real numbers ( i.e., functions from r into 
2). Each condition gives us some information about them, so we have to make 
sure that the information 
contained 
in a single condition will not suffice to 
compute 
one of the reals since in this case this real will be already in V. 
Therefore we shall define the conditions so that each one will contain only a 
finite 
amount 
of information, 
and 
therefore 
each 
condition 
is 
clearly 
insufficient for computing any of the reals. We shall regard the X reals, each 
of which is an c0-sequence of O's and l's, as written in a long sequence 
one 
after the other to form a sequence of length X of O's and l's. The members of 
P will be finite approximations 
to this member 
of x2. 
Therefore 
we take 
P = |f : f 
is a finite function from A into t0,1]] where by "a finite function 
from A"we mean a function on a finite subset of A. For the partial order on P 
we take proper inclusion, i.e., 1" < g if f 
C g. This forcing is called "adding A 
_,e 
Cohen reals. " 
S.3 Lemma: ]]--p "there are at least X reals". 
Proof of the lemma: We shall prove the existence of the reals by giving 
them names. 
Since for every generic G there is a g which satisfies g = 
t3 f 
leg 

17 
we have I~-p"(r~x)(x = 
U f)" 
and by the first lemma in this section there is 
fEC 
-p 
a name g such that 
lip "g = 
0 
f ": Using again the same method we get, 
-p 
for every i < ~, a name a~ defined by ag(n) = g(i+n). 
Now a i is forced to be a 
name of a real number provided g is a name of a function on ~ into 10,1]. We 
shall prove it in the next sublemma. 
3.4 Sublemma: g is a function from h into 10,1] (i.e., this is forced). 
Proof of the sublemma: g is a function since G is a directed set of func- 
tions, hence its union g is a function. 
Also g is into 10,1] since each member 
of G is into 10,1]. 
Dom(g) 
c~ 
since for every f 
c G fcP 
and hence 
Dom (f) C h; we still have to prove that Dora (g) = h. Let i < h; it suffices to 
prove 
that 
the 
set ~)~ = If c P :i c Dom(f)], 
which is clearly is V, is 
predense.

We return 
to the lemma 
(3.3) . Note that 
since we have proved that 
]~-p "g is a function on k into |0,1]" 
we have for each i < ~ ]~-p "" aj ~ aj " 
For this it suffices to prove that for every p c P there is an r ~-P c P and an 
n < ~ such that r I~-p "at(n) # aj(n)" 
since this proves that the set of all 
p eP such thatp 
I~-p "at ~ aj "is predense. 
Let p EP 
. Since Dom(iv) is finite there 
is an n 0 such that for every 
n ~n o i+n ~ Dom (p) and an n I such that for every n -~n 1 j+n ~ Dom (p). 
We set r =p 
U I~i+k,O),(J+k,1), 
where k =,.no,n , . Clearly r is a function 
since i+k,j+k 
f~ Dora (iv) and i+k ~ j+k. Obviouslyp < r and (r forces that ) 
a~(k ) = 0 aj(k ) = 1 hence at(It ) # aj(j). 
Continuation of the proof of 3.2. We started with k, which is a cardinal 
of V and we proved that in V[G] there are at least k real numbers, but is k in 
V[ G] the "same" cardinal as it was in V? As the matter stands now we do not 
even know whether the continuum hypothesis fails in V[G] since even though 

18 
A may be a large cardinal in Vit may be countable or Sl in V[G]. We shall now 
prove that all the cardinals of V are still cardinals in V[G] so for example if 
A = S~then 
~, is still the third infinite cardinal in V[G] and thus A = S2 V[G]. We 
shall prove that the cardinals of V are not collapsed in V[G] for posets P 
which satisfy the countably 
chain condition. 
This is an important 
general 
theorem which we shall use a lot. This will finish the proof of 3.2. 
3.5 Definition: (1) A poset Q satisfies the countable 
chain condition 
(c.c.c.) if Q has no uncountably 
subset of pairwise incompatible members, i.e., 
if every uncountable 
subset of Q contains two compatible members. 
(2) A poset Q satisfies the A-chain condition (A c.c.) if there are 
no A pairwise incompatible members of P. 
3.6 Lemma: If a poset Q satisfies the c.c.c, then 
(i) forcing with Q does not collapse cardinals, (i.e., ]~-q " every cardinal 
of V is a cardinal (of V[G])), and the cofinality is preserved". 
(ii) For every ordinal a and every Q-name T there is, in V, a function H 
on a such that for every ~ < a IH(fl) I -<S0 and ]~-Q. "If T is a function on a 
into V then (Vfl < a)[T(fl) 9 H(fl)] '" 
Proof of Lemma 3.6: 
(ii) We define the functionHonaby 
H(fl) = la 9 V : ('~q 9 Q)(q ]t-o"Tis 
a function on a and T(fl) = a ")]. We have to prove that the right hand side is 
a set, and not a proper class of V. We shall assume it now and prove it later. 
The right hand side is the set of all possible values of T(~) in all the V[G]'s in 
which T[G] is a function on a into V. To see this suppose G is a generic set, 
such that ~-[G] is a function on a into V. Then for some a 9 V V[G] ~"Tisa 
function on a and T(fl) = a't 
By the forcing theorem 
there is a q 9 Q such 
that q ]~Q"T is a function on a and T(fl) = a". Hence a 9 H(fl) and therefore 
V[G] ~ "(Y~ < a)z'(fl) 9 H(fl)': Since this is the case for every generic G we 
have what is claimed in (ii). 

19 
Now we shall prove not only that the class [a 9 V : (3q 6_ Q)(q [~Q T is a 
function on a and ~(lg) = a)] is a set but even that it is a countable set, and 
thus 
]H(~)[ ~S 0. Suppose la~ :i <'~1~, is a subset of this class. 
For each 
such ai there 
is a q~ e Q such that 
q~ [~Q"w is a function 
on ~ and 
T(jg) = a~". Since Q satisfies the c.c.c, there must be some i ~ j such that q~ 
and qj are compatible. 
Let q > q~,qj and let G ~ Q be a generic subset of Q 
which contains q. 
We have qi,qj 9 G and hence, since q~ [[-q "v(~)= a.~", 
qj ]~Q"T(fl) = a 2-'" we have V[G] [="a~ =T(~) =a 3.'" hence a~ =aj. 
Thus we 
have shown that at least two of the a~'s must be equal therefore the class 
la 9 V::~q eQ(q [[-Q"r is a function on a and r(fl) =a'gl 
must be count- 
able, 
Let A be an uncountable cardinal of V and suppose A is not a cardinal in 
V[G] . Then there is an ordinal a < A and a function f e V[G] which maps a 
on A. Let T be a name for J" in V[G]. By part (ii) of our lemma there is a 
function H on a in V such that f (~) a H(fl) and I H(~)[ ~0 
for every fl < a 
We 
have 
therefore 
A = Rang (f) C g H(a). 
But 
in 
V 
we 
have 
[ U H(fl) I ~ [a [~o < A, since A is an uncountable cardinal of V and a < A, and 
p<a 
therefore also [a] < A. Thus we have proved that the uncountable 
cardinals 
are not collapsed in V[G]. ~o is not collapsed since the finite ordinals and 
of V are also finite ordinals and ~ in V[G]. The preservation of the cofinality 
is proved similarly. 
Similarly one can prove for uncountable k. 
3.7 Clain~ If Q satisfies the A-c.c. then 
(i) forcing by Q preserve cardinals and cofinalities which are m A. 
(ii) for every Q-name and ordinal a there is a function H with domain a, 
(H e V) such that [~-Q" if v is a function from a to V then 1-(~8) e H(fl) for 
every ~ < a'; and [H(~) [ < ~ for ~ < a. 
3.8 Lemma: The poser P which we use here for Model 13 satisfies the 
C.C.C. 

20 
Remark: Once we prove this lemma we know that all the cardinals in V 
here are cardinals also in V[G] and therefore k is a cardinal also in V[G], and 
if ~ is the a-th infinite cardinal ~a in V it is also the a-th infinite cardinal in 
v[ a]. 
Proof: Suppose lfr 
<~l] E P, in order to prove Lemma 3.8, it is 
enough to prove that two of the functions are compatible now this reduces to 
the following question: given ~1 finite sets find a sub family such that the 
intersection of any two is a fixed set. Since this idea will be useful later, we 
give it a name: 
3.9 Definition: A family F of finite sets is called a A-system if there is a 
set S such that for any A,B in F A (~ B = S, in this formulation our problem 
reduces to: 
3.10 
Lemma: Given a 
family F 
of 
finite sets, 
IFI =t~ 1 there 
is 
F t ~ F; ]Ftl = ~l such that F r is a A-system. 
Proof: The cardinality of each A in F is a member of r but there are I~ 1 
elements in F, so by the pigeonhole principle some n is obtained uncountably 
many times. In similar cases in the future we will just say: w.l.o.g. IA I = n for 
any A in F. (since all we need is a family of t~ 1 finite sets.) 
Now we proceed by induction on ~z : 
For ~ = 1: this is the pigeonhole principle for t~ 1. 
For n > 1 we distinguish two cases. 
1) There is a E U ~A:A c F] such that there are uncountably 
many B in F such that a E B, then you have an easy induction step ( you 
take a "out" and put is back after using induction hypothesis). 
2) If there is no such a then we build a sequence <An: a < r 
such that a ~ ~ ==> A a ~ A# = r (A a c F) suppose A# is defined for fl < a. 

21 
Now U Ap is countable. 
The subfamily of F of members which contain an ele- 
ment 
of this union 
is clearly countable 
so there 
is A e F. 
Such 
that 
A (5 LJ Ap = ~b, let A a = A and we are done (in this case S = ~b).

More on the cardinality 2 i% and Cohen reals 
Now we want to find what is exactly the power of the continuum 
in V[G] 
for the model from Theorem 3.3. 
4.1 Theorem= Let P = if : f 
is a finite function from ~, to 10,1]{. 
We 
have already shown that 
[~-p 2 ~~ ~* h, we shall show now that if ~0 = h then 
I F-P"2 
= x ': 
Proof: The idea is to construct a family of A~0 canonical names for the 
real numbers and then prove that for every name T there is a canonical name 
r such that l~-P"if Tis arealthen T=r': 
Since a real is a function from 
into ~0,i~ a real r is given by telling for each n < ~ whether r(n) = 0 or 
r(n) = i. For a real r[G] in F[G] the answer whether r(n) = 0 or r(n) = 1 
depends on which condition is in G therefore we shall have a maximal 
antichain <Pn,~ : i -- aN> in P, where a n -~ ~ (because of the c.c.c.), and a 
function fn 
on a n which tells us that if Pn,~ e G then r(n) = fn(~). 
Since 
each generic G C P contains exactly one of the Pn,~, for i ~ an, this will give, 
for any given G, the value of r(n) in a unique 
way. 
For any sequence 
<<Pn,,: <"~>:n 
< ~>, where for every n < ~ fn is a function on a,~ into 
10,1~, 
we 
can 
construct 
a 
P-name, 
which 
we 
shall 
denote 
with 
r(<fn:n < ~>, <<Pn,~ :i < a~> :n < ~>) such that r is a name of a func- 
tion on ~ such that for every n < ~ ifpn,~ c G then r(n) = fn(i). There is no 
difficulty in obtaining such a name by the methods we described above (or by 
3.1). A name of this form is called, in this proof, canonical. 
Let us estimate 
now, in V, the number 
of the cannonical 
names. 
For a 

22 
fixed n, and a given an, there are 2 la~l ----- 2 #0 different suitable fn's. 
There- 
fore there are IIe ~~ = ~ 
possibilities for (fn: 
n < ~). 
P is included in the 
set of all finite subsets of h x 2. I~, x 21 = h and, obviously, also ]PI = ;~. The 
number of countable sequences from P is therefore ;~o thus the number of 
possibilities 
for 
<Pn,~ :i < an) 
is 
at 
most 
~,a0, and 
for 
sequence 
<(Pn.r :i < am)"n 
< co) the number is at most (ht%) ~~ 
h ~~ 
For each 
sequence 
~p.,,-i 
<an):n 
<co) 
we have at most 280 corresponding 
sequences 
(fn 
:n < co), 
thus 
the 
total 
number 
of 
possibilities 
is 
L~o. ~8o = jkHQ. Since ~k 8~ = ~k there are at most ~ canonical names. 
4.2 Lemma. For every name T there is a cannonical name r such that 
I~-p" if T is a real then ~ = r " 
Proof of the lemma. For every n let Dn = IP cP:p 
I~-p"T is not a 
real ': orp 
I~-p"~- is a real and T(n) =s ,g C 10,1~"]. For each n ~)n is a 
dense subset of P, since every q c P can be extended to a p c Dn (If G is a 
generic subset of P which contains q then in V[G] either T[G] is not a real or 
T[G] is a real in which case T[G](n) = 0 or T[G](n) = 1. By the forcing state- 
ments which hold in V[G], and, without loss of generality, we can assume 
p -~ q. This p is in ~)n). Let ~n be a maximal antichain contained in ~)~. 
~ince P 
satisfies the 
c.c.c, we have 
]-91 ~e0 
and we take a n = I-q~l, 
~n = {P~.~ :i <an]. 
Wedefinef~

fn(~) 
Let r =r(~fn 
:n <w), 
(<Pn,, :i <~n):n 
<w)), 
and we shall prove that 
for every generic GcP 
V[G] ~"if 
Tis arealthenT=r[G]". 
Assume that 
T[G] is indeed a real. 
Since r is a name of a real, by its construction 
T[G] = riG] 
will 
be 
established 
once 
we 
prove 
that 
for 
every 
n < co T[G](n) = r[G](n). Since {Pn.i : i < anJ is a maximal antichain in P (in 
V) G contains Pn,~ for a unique i. 
Since Pn,r ~ ~)n and since Pn.~ cannot 
force 
that 
T is 
not 
a 
real 
(as 
T[G] 
is 
a 
real 
in 
V[G]), 
we 
have 
Pn,~ I~-p "~-(n) = g ': for some g E 10,11. By the definition of fn(i) we have 
Sn(i) ~ s for the same s 
By the definition of r we have r[G](n) = fn(i) if 

23 
Pn,r 6 G. 
Since P,~,i [~-P"T(~z) =g" 
we have 
V[G] ~(n) 
=g =f,~(i) =(n) 
which is what we have to prove. 
To prove 
I[-P "L9%<A" we shall show that 
for every generic 
G c P 
V[G] ~ "Lg~~ 
''. Suppose V[G] ~"2S~ 
+': then in V[G] there is a one- 
to-one function f 
on A § into the set of reals. Let a be a name of this function. 
For every i < A § there is a canonical name r~ such that [}-v "a(i) = r~ "(since 
we can either regard a(i) itself as a name and use the lemma above, or else 
use an earlier lemrna, 3.1, which establishes the existence of a name T such 
that [~p "a(i) = v"whenever 
[~-p "'(~z)(a(i) = x)"and then use the lemma to 
obtain I~p "~ = r~".) Since there are at most A canonical names, and A+ of 
V[G] 
is also 
>h + of V there 
is a j ~i 
such that rj =r~. 
We have in 
V[ G] 
f (i) = a[G](i) = r~[G] = rj[G] = a[G](j) = f (j) contradicting 
the fact 
that f is one-to-one. 
So we have proved 4.1. 
4.3 Cohen generic reals. Let us take _P = If : f is a finite function from 
into I0,1]], withp < q being defined asp 
c q. This is called Cohen forcing. 
It is easily seen that if G is ageneric 
subset of P then uG is areal. 
Let us 
see now that we can reconstruct 
G from U G by taking G to be the set of all 
finite subsets of uG. 
If p e G then p is obviously a finite subset of uG. 
If p 
is a finite subset of U G then p =~<&i,s 
<•] 
for some n <r 
Since 
<k,,s 
e G there is ap, 
e G such that <k,,gi> 
ep,. 
Since G is directed 
theI:e 
is 
a 
q ~ G 
such 
that 
q >p~ 
for 
all 
i < n. 
Obviously 
p =l</Q,g,> :i <~]<q, 
and since 
G is downward-closed 
we have also 
p e G. Since G and U G can be constructed 
from each other we can identify 
them and speak of a generic real G. Given V, we shall call a real number g a 
Cohen real over V if for some G c P which is generic over V we have g = U G. 
When we talk here about reals we talk about members of the cantor set "2 
, given an open subset A of ~2 in Vthis A is also a set of reals in the (true) 
universe, but we are interested not in A itself in the universe but in the s.ub- 

24 
set of ~2 in the universe that has there the same description A has in V. For 
example, suppose A is [r c~2: 
V ~r-~p] 
for some p E:p then we are 
interested in the set A ~ = Ir E ~2 : r ~p]. 
Obviously A = A" /~ V and A* contains reals which are not in V (since, in the 
universe, IA*I = 2~~ while IV] = ~0) and hence not in A. The analogous situa- 
tion 
for 
the 
real 
line 
~ 
is 
when 
we 
look 
at 
a 
rational 
interval 
(a,b ) v = [x E By: a < x < b ~, and the corresponding set in the universe is 
(a,b) = ~x EI~ :a <x <b]. 
Obviously (a,b) v=(a,b) 
N V and (a,b) contains 
reals which are not in V ( since I(a,b)l = 2 ~~ and IV] =t~0) and hence not in 
(a,b) v. Let us denote with BIo the basic open set lrc 
~2:r 
Dp] in the Can- 
tor space, and withB vthe 
corresponding set Ir E~2: V ~r 
Dp] in V. Obvi- 
ously 
B v = B~ CI V. 
Given 
an 
open 
set 
A B 
in 
V 
we 
define 
A*=UIBI~ :p EP, B~EAv]. 
A ~ is obviously an open subset 
of ~2 and 
A V = A * f~ V. 
For 
a 
closed 
set 
C v 
we 
take 
A * = o2 f~ V - C v 
and 
C'=~2-A*, 
we can write it also as C*= ~r E ~: (u 
< co) B~n (~ C v# ~. 
One can easily see that if A v is a clopen set then A* is the same set whether 
we regard A v as an open set or as a closed set. 
We shall use AV only when Av E V; in fact for every Borel set A E V there 
is a unique 
Borel set A ~ in the universe such that they have a common 
definition (in V) and then A" ~ V = A. 
The close connection between Cohen forcing and generic real is a quite 
universal phenomena for the forcing in use. 
4.4 Theorem: A real number r is a Cohen real (or generic real) over V iff 
r belongs to no C* where C r is a closed nowhere dense subset of ~2 in V, or in 
other words, if r belongs to every set A" for every set A ~ V which is a dense 
open set of w2 in V. 
Proof: Let r be a Cohen real and let AV be a dense open set in V. We 

25 
have r = UG for some generic subset 
G of P. 
Let ~=tP

Now assume that for every dense open set AV,r e A*. Let G be the set of 
all finite subsets of r, then r = U G. We shall prove that G is a generic subset 
of P and hence r is a Cohen real. Let ~) be a dense subset of P. Then 
Av= uIB~:p E~)] is a dense open subset of (~2) V, and therefore reA ~

Since B ffis a closed set in

4.5 Corollary. ]'he set of all Cohen reals over a model V is a comeager 
subset of 2% 
Proof: The reals which are not Cohen reals are exactly the reals which 
do not belong to some set A* where A v is a dense open subset of ~2 N V in V. 
Let ~) = [i0 E P : B vC Av I. Since Av is a dense open subset of ~2 I~ V in V, ~) 
is a dense subset of P and A* = u[Bp : p E ~)1 is a dense open subset of ~ 
The set of the reals which are not Cohen reals is U[O2-A* 
:AVE V,A v is 
dense open in (~ 
This is the union of I~ 0 nowhere dense sets (2 ~ -A* is 
nowhere dense since ~2 - A * is dense open, the union is countably since V is ) 
and is thus a meager set. Therefore the set of all Cohen reals is comeager. 
Remark: Does the Cohen forcing collapse cardinals? 
No, since P 
is 
countably and hence, obviously it satisfies the c.c.c. See Lemma 3.6 (i).

Lemma. Let CP,-<) be a poset in V and let Q be a dense subset of P, 
(a) If G is a generic subset of P over V then H = G n Q is a generic sub-

(b) If H is a generic subset of Q over V then 
G = lp E P : (:~q c H)p ~ q l is a generic 
subset of P over Vand H = G A Q- 
(c) The assertion (a) and (b) above establish a one-one correspondence 
between the generic subsets of P and those of Q. If G and H are correspond- 
ing generic sets then V[G] = V[H] and therefore the same statements are 
forced by the forcing notions P and Q.

Proof of the lemma. 
(a) It is obvious that G N Q is downward closed in Q. Let p,pt e G A Q. 
Since G is directed there is a p" c G such that p" ~_p,.pt. 
Q is dense, and 
hence 
|q c Q : q ~-p"~ 
is 
predense 
above 
p". 
Since 
p" E. G 
G n |q ~ Q:q rap"| #r 
let q c G n Q, so q ~-p"mp,p?. 
Thus we have 
seen that G N Q is directed. Let ~) c V be dense in Q then, as easily seen, ~) 
is 
also 
dense 
in 
P. 
Therefore 
we 
have 
D A (Q N G) =(~) n Q) N G =~ 
N G~r 
We can conclude that G N Q is 
a generic subset of Q. 

27 
Obviously |p eP:(~q 
9 
n Q)p >q~ c G. 
In the other 
direction, 
if 
p e G then, as we have seen for p" above, there is a q e G N Q such that 
q ~p. 
Therefore 
P 9 IP e P : (2q 9 G n Q)p ~ q~ 
and 
so 
Ip 9 P: (:~q 9 G N Q)P ~ ql = G. 
(b) G is obviously downward closed and directed. 
Let ~) be a dense 
upward closed subset of P, then /~) N Q is obviously a dense subset of Q. 
Then##H 
N(D 
A Q)=HN,~cG 
ND. H=G N Q is obvious. 
(e) Since we have G e V[H], because G can be easily computed from H, 
we can evaluate all the P-names in V[H] and we get therefore V[G] C V[H]. 
Similarly H 9 V[ G] implies V[H] c V[ G], hence V[H] = V[ G]. 
(d),(e) are left to the reader. 
In fact in 5.1 we have proved that P,Q are equivalent where 
5.g Definition: The forcing notions P, Q are equivalent if there are ~',a, a 
P-name and a Q-name resp. such that 
(1) I~-p "T is a generic (over V) subset of Q '" 
(2) I~-q "a is a generic subset of P" 
(3) for G c P generic, G = a[T[G]] 
(4) for G c Q generic, G = T[a[G]] 
Clearly equivalence of forcing notion is an equivalence relation. Let 
5.3 Definition: (1) A function f 
from P into Q is called a complete 
embedding if: for any maximal antichain .gc P, 3"(.9)= if(P):P e..9~ is a 
maximal antichain of Q. 
(2) We write p <o Q when Pc 
Q, for p,q eP, p ~="p <q"iff 
Q ~= "p ~ q and the identity mapping is a complete embedding of P into Q. 
5.4. Lemma: If ,I' is a complete embedding of P into Q then there is a 

28 
Q-name a, ]~-Q "a is a generic subset of P". If in addition the range of f is a 
dense subset of Q, then P,Q are equivalent. 
Proof: Easy. 
5.5 Definition: (1) For a forcing notion P, andp ,q e P, we sayp 
~ q(p,q 
are equivalent ) if any r e P is compatible with p iff it is compatible with q. 
Clearly ~ is an equivalence relation on P. 
(2) We define P~ ~ as follows: 
the 
members 
are p/~(p 
cP) 
and p/~<-q/~ 
iff there 
are p?ep/~, 
q? 9 q/~ 
such thatp?- < q?. 
5.6 Clain~ (1) Note that in Definition 5.5:

GcP 
generic then p e G iffq 9 G; 
-p 
and p / ~ ----- p / ~ implies p / ~ = q / ~. So P~ ~ is a partial order. 
2) The function p -~ p / ~ is a complete embedding of P into P~ 
with a dense range ; hence P,P/~ 
are equivalent. 
Proof: Suppose p 9 G but q ~ G, take a Maximal antichain .9, such that

then G ~.9=lr] 
andp,r 
are compatible while q,p are not !!. So 
p 9 q/~

It is interesting to note that in each equivalence class of equivalent forc- 
ing we can choose canonically a representative, 
which is essentially a com- 
plete Boolean algebra (without the one). 
5.7 Definition: For any forcing notion P let: 
(1) A set A c P is called open-regular 
if it is open and for every 
p c P-A there is q ->p incompatible with A , i.e., (Vr c P)(r ~ q -~ r ~ A), 
(2) RO(P) is the poser whose set of elements is the non-empty 
open regular

incompatible with A is incompatible with B.

5.8 Theorem : (1) The mapping p -* to(p) is a complete embedding of P 
into RO(P); 
(3) RO(P)/m, if we add to it a maximal element 
1, becomes 
a 
complete Boolean algebra; 
(3) If B is a complete Boolean algebra , and P = B- 
[01, (with 
the usual ordering of a Boolean algebra ) then RO(P)/~ is isomorphic to P, 
moreover, we can use the isomorphismp 
-* r0 (p). 
Proof: Well known. 
5.9 Theorer~ 
The forcing notions P,Q are equivalent

6.1 Discussion: 
Random Reals. Let C be the set of all closed subsets of the real line, B the 
set of all Borel subsets of the real line and ~ 
the set of all measurable sub- 

32 
sets of the real ine. 
For X c IC, B,MI we take PX = {A c X : A is of positive 
Lebesgue measure 
~, and p < q if q Cp. We use here the real line, but we 
could have used also the Cantor space as the real line. For A E ~, let/z(A) be 
the Lebesgue measure of A. 
Every measurable 
set of positive measure includes a closed set of positive 
measure, and thus PC is dense in p~z~. Since C ~ B c ~, the three notion of 
forcing P~, 
PB, and PC are interchangeable. 
We shall work mostly with PC 
and when we do not care with which of these notions we work we shall write 
just P. 
First we shall prove that PM satisfies the c.c.c. Let pi, i < al be pairwise 
incompatible 
conditions. 
For each i < t~ 1 
/z(pi) > 0, where br denotes Lebes- 
gue 
measure. 
Therefore 
there 
is 
a 
positive 
integer 
r~ 
such 
that 
/z(pi (3 (--n~,q~)) _~ 1__. Since there are t~ 1 i's and t~ 0 positive integers there is 
q~ 
an uncountable 
subset S of t~l and an qz c ~ such that ni = n for all i c S. 
Since for i,j < ~1, i ~ j, pi and pj are incompatible we have 
/z(pi (~ pj) = 0. Let T ~ S contain 2n 2 + 1 members, then 
n

For every positive real r in V the set [[rLr

consists of a single real g. A real obtained in this way is called a random real. 
We shall see that we can reconstruct G from g. Now let us mention that since 
PC is dense in P~ we have, for every p c P~ N G a q ->p, q c PC N G, i.e., 
q cp. 
Since the generic real g belongs to q V[G], and since q cp 
implies 
q Vial C p v[G] also g E p ~c]. Thus for every Borel set p v in G g E p v[a]. 
To reconstruct G from g it suffices to tell which closed sets belong to G, 
since if we deal with P~ or P~/~. C will consist of all members, of P~ or P~/~ 
which 
are 
-< 
these 
closed 
sets. 
Now 
we

A v tg G and extend ~A ~'] to an antichain S of PC which is maximal among the 
antichains which consist of pairwise disjoint sets. We shall see that S is a 
maximal antichain of PC" If this is not the case there is an E c PC such that 
E is incompatible with every member of S, i.e., tt(E (5 B) = 0 for every B c S. 
By the c.c.c. 
S is countable, hence tt(E- 
US)=]z(E)-tt(E 
N US), but 
Iz(E f~ US)<- ~0=0 
hence /~(E-- S) =tz(E) >0. E-US 
is a Borel set of 
BcS 
positive measure, hence it includes a closed set W of positive measure. For 
every B c S if A B ~ if N uS = ~b, contradicting the maximality of S. Now 
that we have proved that S is a maximal antichain we know that G contains 
some member B v of S, which is different from A v (since A v ~ G) and there- 
fore B v f~A v=~b. Since B vC Gwe haveg cB v[c], henceg cB VIal NAV[G]-

tance between B ~' N [n,n+l] V and A v C~ [n,n+l] ~' is some d > 0. Let e be a

Proof: Assume that r is random over V, r c

Let A v be a Borel set with Iz(A v) = 0 . As easily seen the complement ~v _ A v,

Since in V[G] there are no cardinals between A and A + all the ordinals 
< A + are countably in V[G] so (A+) v = S~ g] provided A + is a cardinal in V[G] 
thus we must check what is the fate of the chain condition for. Col(So,A). 
Col(So,A ) has A pairwise incompatible members, for example |< 0,a> : a < A]. 
However, it is easy to see that I Col (S0,A) I = A and hence Col (S0,A) satisfies the 
A + - antichain condition and the cardinal A + is not collapsed by forcing with 
a (S0,A). 
We define

6.6 Discussion: Let G be a generic subset of C/(S0,<A ) over V, and let 
ufG = LIG. Obviously for every 0 < a < A fg(a,-) 
is a mapping of co onto a, 
and hence a is countably in V[G]. What about A, is it, too, countab]y in V[G] 
or else is it ~41v[~]? If A is singular in V it stays singular also in V[G], hence it 
cannot be Sl VIol and it is countable. 
6.7 Theorem= If A is regular then Col(So,<A ) satisfies the A chain condi- 
tion, and hence A = 14~lC] in V[G].

If. ITERATION OF FORCING. 
i. The composition of two forcing notions. 
1.1 Discussion: We shall now ask the following question. Suppose we 
start with V, extend it once by means of the forcing notion P to V[G], where 
G is a generic subset of P, then we take a forcing notion Q in V[G] and 
extend V[G] to V[G][H], where H is a subset of Q generic over V[G]; can 
V[G][H] be obtained from V by a single forcing extension? 
The answer is 
positive as we shall now see. 
Since Q c V[G],Q does not necessarily belong to V but it has a P-name Q 
in V. Since Q is a poset we have, by the forcing theorem that p 
I]-p "Q is a 
N 
poset", for some p c G. We shall, however, make the stronger assumption, 
which suffices for all our needs that 
]~-F "q is a poser ." If this stronger 
assumption would fail to hold we can define 
I 
oth 
r 
e 
and then ]]-e"Qtis a P-name for Q in V[G]" We define the set P * Qas fol- 
lows 
1.2 Definition: P * Q= l~P,q> :P c P,q is a canonical name 
potential member of Q, i.e., I]-e "q c Q", q a canonical P-name ]. 
of a 
What are the canonical names of a potential member of Q and why do we 
use this concept? A member of V[G] may have a proper class of names in V 
so P * Q would be a proper class if we would not restrict the names to a cer- 
N 
tain representative set. What is important is that every member of Q[G] for 
every generic subset G of P has a name in this set, e.g., has a canonical 
name. By 1 5.1B this is true. 

40 
We define on P * Q a (pre) partial order as follows: 
<Pl,ql> ~ <P2,q2> if P l --P2 and P2 l~-p "ql ----- 
q2 in the partial order Q". 
First <p,q> <- <p,q> since p [~-p"q -<q"because 
<p,q> e P " 2 implies 
P I}-p"q e Q" 
and 
since 
I~/'<9,<--> 
is 
a

Now 
assume 
<Pl,ql> -<<pa,q2> -----<P3,q3> then, sincep3 ->p2 >-pl we havepa >/91 and 
P3 I~-P "'ql < qa ^ qz'c qa" 
Since also l~-P "<Q,~<> 
is a poser", 
clearly 
p3 IF~ "q, <-q3" and so <p,.q,> 
<- <,~.q3>- 
We shall use P * Q as a forcing 
notion. So we have proved: 
1.3 Claim= If P e v is a forcing notion, ]~-p "Q is a forcing notion" then 
P * Q is a forcing notion. 
1.4 Theorem: This theorem asserts, essentially, that forcing by P * Q is 
equivalent to forcing first by P and then by Q[ G].

As we prove it for every D, Gp is a generic subset of P over B. 
(1)b (i) We want to prove that Gp.r 
is downward closed, so let 
Q[Gp] ~ qt_ q[Gp] in V[Gp]. Then by the Forcing Theorem there is a canon- 
ical name qt of a potential member of Q such that qt = qt[Gp] ' and for some 
pte Gp pt 1]- qt _< q. If q[Gp] e Gp.q/Gp then for some p e Gp <p,q> e Gp.@ 
Since pt 6 Gp there are p",q" such that <p",q"> e Gp~_. Since GpoQ is

Since also

1.5 Lemma : For every P * Q -name T there is a P-name Y such that for 
every generic subset Gp of P, V[Gp] is a Q[Gp]-name in V[Gp] and for every 
subset Gq of Q which is generic over V[Gp] , ~[Gp][GQ] = "r[Gp * GQ]. We use 
the notation Y[ Gp] = T/Gp. 
Proof: 
By

rank 
of 
the 
name 
r. 
Suppose 
T = ~<<p,,qr 
:i < io] where <P.t,qi> c P * Q and T i is a name of rank 
By the induction hypothesis each T i has a translation T~ such that T~[Gp] is a 
Q[Gp]-name and T~[Gp][GQ] = Ti[G P * GQ]. Let vi be the name of <qi,v~> 
and let ~ = I<Pi,~i> ;i < i0]; this is clearly suitable. (See I. 1.8). 
1.6 Definition: If P ~ Q (see Definition I 5.3), G C P generic, then let 
Q~ G c V[G] be the following poser: 
its set of elements is lq c Q:q is compatible in Q with everyp c GI , 
its order is inherited from Q.

Iterated forcing. 
2.1 Discussion: We saw already that two successive extensions 
of V by 
forcing are equivalent to an appropriate 
single extension. 
We want to ask now 
the same question about an infinite number 
of extensions 
by forcing. The 
need for this arose in the following ease. 
By a classical thoerem, 
if a linearly ordered 
set is dense and complete, 
has no first or last member, 
and has a dense countable 
subset then it is 
order-isomorphic 
to the real numbers. 
Souslin raised the question whether 
one can replace the last requirement, 
that there is a dense countable subset, 
by the requirement 
that every set of pairwise disjoint intervals is at most 
countable. 
The 
statement 
that 
these 
two 
additional 
requirements 
are 
equivalent is called Souslin's hypothesis, and an ordered set which is a coun- 
terexample 
to Souslin's hypothesis is called a Sousttn's continuum. Jech and 
Tennenbaum 
proved the independence 
of Souslin's hypothesis of the axioms 
of ZFC by using forcing to obtain a universe in which there is a Souslin con- 
tinuum. 
Later Jensen proved that in the constructible 
universe there is a 
Souslin continuum. 
To prove the consistency of Souslin's hypothesis Solovay 
and Tennenbaum 
proceeded as follows: Given V and a Souslin continuum 
C in 
it one can construct 
a generic extension V[G] of V in which C is no more a 
Souslin continuum 
by a generic 
introduction 
of an uncountable 
set of 

45 
pairwise disjoint intervals in C. In this case we say that we have "destroyed" 
C. Using the same method we can go on destroying more and more Souslin 
continua. 
It can be shown that a Souslin's continuum 
has exactly L #~ points, 
hence there are at most 22t~~ Souslin continua ( up to isomorphism). 
However, 
when we destroy one Souslin continuum 
new ones will be created and we must 
be sure we have destroyed them all. Since we have infinite time at our dispo- 
sal this maybe possible. Really we can show that it is enough to deal with sub- 
sets of Souslin continuum 
of power t~ 1, so there are only 2 t% such orders. 
We 
shall iterate h times, so that in the new universe, 2 s~ = 2 I~t = ~, so we have a 
chance to catch our tail. 
2.2. Definition: We shall call Q =<Q.:j 
<a> 
(or Q =<Pj,Qj 
:j <a>), 
for some ordinal a, a system of FS ~finite support) iterated forcing if each 
Q ,j < a is a name, for the forcing notion Pj, of a quasi-order, i.e., []-D ''Q is 
~j 
~i 
a quasi-order", 
where Pj for j ~ a is defined by recursion 
as the set of all 
finite functions f 
on j such that for all i c Dora (f) f (i) is a canonical name 
for the forcing notion P~ of a potential member 
of Q. and we call Pa the 
direct limit of Q. 
This is called iterated forcing ~tth finite support since the functions f we 
use in the Pj's are finite functions. 
The Pj's are sets since we restrict the 
choice of the f (i)'s to canonical names. We can replace "finite support" by CS 
( " countable support") or " <r-support". 
The 
partial 
order 
on 
Pj 
for 
j -< a 
is 
defined 
as 
follows 
f -< g <=> Dora (f) c Dora (g) ^ (Yi e Dom (f)) [g r i I]-p~ "f (i) ---@ g (i) "]. 
2.3 Definition: For fl ~ 7 ~ a we define P~,7 by recursion on Y as follows. 
P~,? is the set of all P#-names of finite functions f 
on 7-i$ such that for all 
c Dora (f) f (i) is a canonical name for the forcing notion Pi of a potential 
memberof 
Qr andf

2.8 Theorem: If ~ Q. : i < a t

N?, 
each i < a Qi satisfies the c.c.c. ( i.e., I~-P~ "O satisfies the c.c.c.") then Pa 
satisfies the c.c.c. 
Proof: We proceed by induction on a. For a = 0 P0 consists of the null 

48 
sequence 
only, hence it satisfies, trivially, the c.c.c. If a is a successor let 
a = fl + 1 then we have by II 2.4 Pa = P~+I ~ Pp * P~,~+I ~' P~ * Q 9 By the 
~p 
induction 
hypothesis 
P~ satisfies the c.c.c, and since also Q 
satisfies the 
~~ 
c.c.c, the last theorem 
establishes that also P~ * Q satisfies the c.c.c. The 
~~ 
relation ~ obviously preserves the c.c.c, hence P~ too satisfies the c.c.c. 
So assume a is alimitordinal. 
Let lPi :i <r 
~Pa. 
IDompi:i <c01] is 
an uncountable 
family of finite sets, so w.l.o.g, by Lemma I 3.10 we may 
assume it forms a A system whose kernel is some finite set A included in a

in some ~ < a (since a is limit), but [pt r ~ : i < wl] ~ P~+I has 
by induction 
hypothesis 
there are two compatible 
numbers Pi~$, pjt~ , i.e., 
there is q c P~, p ->p~r~, pjt~, but then clearly Pi,Pj are compatible 
in Pa. 
e.g. q kJ (Pi t [~,a) kJ (P~" t [~,a)) is a common bound. 
w 
Martin Axiom and few applications. 
What is the meaning 
of MA (Martin axiom discovered 
by Martin and 
Rowbottom independently). 
It says that we can find quite generic sets inside 
our universe. As we have noted before (see l 1.4 ), if P has no trivial generic 
subset (i.e., above any p e P there are two incompatible member of P) then 
we cannot find a generic subset of P over V. But we may well find such G ~ P 
generic over some Ft ~ V. So it is plausible that for any family of < ~ dense 
subset of P there is a directed G c P not disjoint to any of them. How can we 
build a model V satisfying such a requirement? 
We extend and re-extend the 
universe, in stage a we extend the universe we have got V a, to Va+ 1 = Va[Ga] 
by forcing by some forcing notion Qa. The hope is that in the end Vx = kJ V~ 
a<h 
is as required, as if P c V~, is a suitable forcing notion (satisfying the c.c.e in 
our case) ~)i c P dense for i < io, then, <Di:i 
< i0> belongs to some V~, and 
for some j, 
imj 
<X, 
Qj =P. 
So the generic 
object 
Gj CPj 
will be as 
required; so this construction 
is similar in some sense, to the consturction 
of 
compact models in model theory. 

49 
This is carried out by iterated forcing. 
3.1 Definition: ~Iartins's Axiom for ~: MA~. If P is a poser satisfying the 
c.c.c, and ~)i C P is dense in P for i < ~ then there is a subset G of P which is 
directed such that for every i < ~ G CI Di # r 
3.2 Remark: In order to have MA~ it suffices to require that the 
definition of MA~ hold only for P such that IP] <- ~. To prove this let P be a 
poser satisfying the c.c.c, and let D i c P be dense in P. For i < ~ let f, be a 
function on P such that forp c P fi(P) ->P and fi(p) c Di. Let g be a func- 
tion on P xP 
such that for p,q c P if p 
and q are compatible then 
g(p,q)>--p,q. LetP0 be any member of P and let Q be the closure of IP0{ 
under the functionf,,i <~andg. 
We have ]Q] <-~. Let us see that D i N Q 
is dense in Q. Letp c Qthenf,(p)-p 
,f,(p) cDi, andfi(p) c Q since Qis 
closed under fi- Now let us prove that Q satisfies the c.c.c . Let A be an 
antichain in Q; we claim that A is also an antichain in P and hence IA ] -<t~ 0. 
Letp,q c A, thenp,q are incompatible in P since ifp ,q were compatible in P 
we would have g~,q)~-p,q, but Q is closed under g hence also g(p,q) c Q 
and p,q are compatible also in Q, contradicting the assumption that A is an 
antichain in Q. By the version of MA,~ for ]P I -< ~: there is a directed subset G 
of Q such that G N D, C~ Q #r 
<x. This G is as required. 
3.3 Definition: Martin's Axiom KA: (V~ < 2 8~ 
MA r. 
MAyo is true since if for i < ~ 
D~ is a dense subset of P then let us pick 
by induction a sequence <Pn ' n < ~> such thatp~ 
c D n andp~+l -->p~, then 
choose G = ~n : n < a~. 
Therefore we have that the CH implies MA, However, usually one means by 
MAMA with the negation of the CH. 
3.4 Theorem. If t~ 0 < h = ~,<~ then there is a P 
] P ] = A which satisfies 
the c.c.c, and such that II-p "2 ~~ = ~, ^ MA " 

so 
Proof: First we shall show that if k = ~,<x, [P{ -- k and P satisfies the 
c.c.c, then ]~-p "k = k <~''. Since P satisfies the c.c.c, and X > l~ 0, by I 3.6(i) 
is an uncountable 
cardinal also in V[ G]. 
To prove the theorem 
we shall give a canonical name to every function 
from/~ to ~,, where /~ is a cardinal 
< ~,. The canonical names (for this con- 
text) will be as follows: 
such a name has the form 
where j~,n < k, 
Pi.n e P. For each P-name T, I~-p "T a function from/~ to ~" 
N 
N 
choose for each i </~, a maximal antichain 
IP~,n " n < col c P (possibly with 
repetitions) such that p~,n I~-/, "T(i) = J~,n "for some Ji,n < h ( this is possible 
as D~ = [p :p I~-P "T(i) = j " for some j < A is a dense open subset of P, as P 
satisfies the c.c.c.)( if the maximal antichain is finite we can change notation 
or artificially increase it). Let 
then clearly I]-p "Tt = T". So we can consider only canonical T. What is their 
number? 
for each i </z we choose two r 
one from P and one 
from ~,, so we have 
<~I%]PII%; and 
so the numbers 
of such names 
is 
(X#0[p[l%)~,~h~<~<x=~. 
Now clearly in V P, ~=k 
for /~<~. 
Now we 
return to the proof. 
Let (Saa ,:a <R, /~<k,/zis 
a cardinal) 
be a partition of ~to 
disjoint 
sets each of cardinality k such that i c S,,~-* i -> a. We shall define Q, by 
induction. 
At stage a all the Qp's , for fl < a, are defined, and hence Pa is 
defined. Let (<~ : $ c Sa,~) be a list of the canonical names for the forcing 
Pa of quasi-orders 
of/z. We shall use <~ in the ~-th stage of the construction 
but since for ~ c Sa, ~ 
~ 
a this does not spoil the induction. 
How many 
such canonical names are there? 
Each Qp, for fl < a, is a name of a quasi 
order of a cardinal /~ < ~, in the forcing Pt. 
By the induction 
hypothesis 
iPp[ ~ ~, hence, as we saw, there are at most k such names. 
If we denote with 
Qp the set of these names we get that Pa is a set of finite subsets of the set 

51 
U|lfl] x Qp " fl < a} which is of cardinality < A and hence IP=] ~ },. A quasi- 
order on /$ is a function on /z x # into ~0,1}, and as we saw the number of 
canonical names in the forcing Pa is ~ A, since IRa [ ~ A. 
[<~,<~> where 
i c Sa,~, aTzd 
We define now Qi = I 
I~-e~ "(]z,<i>) satisfies the 
{< 1,~b> otherudse 
C.C.C. 
" 
Since for a <- i Pa C Pc every name for the forcing Pa is also a name for the 
forcing P~. It is now obvious that for each i < k ][-~ "Qi satisfies the c.c.c, " 
since if this does not hold for </z,<i> then we have chosen for Q~ < 1,~b> 
which obviously satisfies the c.c.c. Therefore P = Px also satisfies the c.c.c.

]PI--A.

true also that 2 ~~ ~ }, since, as we shall see in the next lemma MA# --------> 2 #~ > #.

Theorem 
Assume 
MA and 
let 
k 
be 
a 
cardinal N 0-<k<2 I% 
<At: i < A> a family of infinite pairwise almost disjoint subsets of r (i.e., if 
i ~j,i,j 
<A then A t CIAj is finite), and let S be a subset of h. There is a 
function f 
on ~ into 10,1] such that for all i <k 
f tat =a~ l& iffi eS, 
where l& is the function on At with the fixed value 1 and =ae denotes that two 
functions have the same values for all numbers in their domain except 

53 
finitely many. 
Proof: Let 
P= 
~f :f 
is a function such that Dom(f) 
=Aq U "'" tJA~ (3 W for 
some i 1 ..... 
/~ e S and a finite W c co and for 1 ~ g -- n 
f t Ar ==e 1A~]. 
The partial order on P is proper inclusion. 
Since, for each f 6 P,f-l[lO]] is finite we can take for each f 6 P a finite 
F/f D f-l[101] to play the role of W in the definition of P. 
To see that P 
satisfies the c.c.c, let <fi "i <~l> 
be a sequence 
of 
members of P. Since all the f t Wf belong to the countable set of all finite 
functions from co into |0,1| we have i ~ j, i,j < Sl such that fi t ;ff, = fjt 
Wfj. 
Obviously f~ (j fj is a function and a member of P, hence fi and fj are com- 
patible. 
We shall specify k dense subsets of P: By MA there is a directed G c P 
such that ~5 N G # ~b for each one of the specified dense sets D. 
Let 
g = [J G . Since G is directed every two members of G are compatible and g 
is a function from a subset of c0 into 10,11. We establish now the following pro- 
perties of G. 
1. Dora(g) =w. 
For n e~ 
let ~n = If c P:n 
6Dom(f)l. 
~,~

Since 
G • ~)n ~ # 
there 
is 
an

such 
that 
rL 9 Dom (f), hence 
Dom (g) D Dora (f) 9 n.

If 
i e S 
then 
g r A~ =ae 1Ac 
For 
i e S 
let 
~)* = If eP:Dorn(f)

If

then 
Ar (3 Dom (f) c 
LJ Ar (3 A~ tJ W and each set participating in this union is 

54 
finite. It follows immediately now that f 
U (At - Dom (f)) x ~ iI 9 P and this 
member 
of Pis

We have now G (SDt #r 
Let f

f tAt =aet& and sinceg

If i ~ S then g r A t obtains the value 0 for infinitely many 
members 
of At. 
Let ~)~,~ =If

(m ~n

To see 
that ~)~,n is dense let f 
9 P, and let f 
be as in the definition of P. 
Since 
i ~S, i ~ Ill ..... 
i n], therefore, 
as we saw above, Dom(f) 
(sAt is finite. 
Since 
At 
is 
infinite 
there 
is 
an 
m 9 
such 
that 
m ~n. 
f U I(m,O>{ cP hence f U [(m.O>{ 9 
and Dn,, is dense. Since 
Dn.~ (5 G #r 
there 
is an f 
9 G such that there is an m 9 
m->n 
and 
f(m) 
= 0, hence g(m) = 0. Thus g(m) = 0 for arbitrarily large m 9 A t . 
It is natural to ask 
Question 3.6: In Theorem 3.6 conditions, is there an f :~ -* ~0,11 such 
that f rAt =~ 
1A~ for i 9 
and f tAt =ae 0& fori 
r 
We shall return 
to 
this later. Note however 
3.7 Theorem= In Theorem 3.6 we can omit the requirement 
"At 9 w'" 
requiring only ~ I = I%. 
Proof: We let 
P 
= If :f is a function whose domain is At, U " " " U A~ and whose range is 
~|0,1~ 
for some n < ~ 
i 1 9 S ..... 
i n 9 S, f-l[[0~]

inclusion 
If pi 9 P(i <1~1) are Sl-conditions, 
let At = uDompj, 
A'= 
U At, so 
~l "~S0 fori 
< ~t, ]A'l =sl, and letg be a one-to-one function fromA* onto 
~1. Define a function h on ~1 
h(a) = Ig(i):i 9 Dompa,pa(i) = 0] 
Now C = li:g maps At onto i| is a closed unbounded 
subset of c~ 
and for 
a 9 C, h (a) is a finite subset of a. Hence by Fodor's lemma for some a # fl in 

55 
C, h(a) = h(fl), hence clearly Pa UP~ e P, and trivially Pa,Pp ~Pa UPa" So 
P satisfies the c.c.c. 
Now 
if 
i < A, 
i g S, 
At N ( U Aj) 
is 
infinite, 
2'gs 
~[~,n = IP e P:A~ N P-l(|0]) has cardinality m n] is a dense subset of P. 
then 
So there is a directed G c P, G n D~,n ~ r for i < A, i g s, n < co and let 
f~ be uf, 
andf+be 
an extension of f* byf+(~) =0 for~e 
UAt- 
UAt- 
f~G 
~<A 
~ES 
It is easy to check f + is as required. 
A partial answer to the Question 3.6 is 
3.8 Definition: A sequence <At :i < A> 
of infinite pairwise almost 
disjiont subset of r is called a tree if for any a < A [A a N Ap:~ < AI is linearly 
ordered 
by 
inclusion, 
i.e., 
for 
any 
~,7 
Aa NAp ~ A a n A7 
or 
Aa n A7 c A a N Ap.

3.9 Theorem= Assume MA, let X be a cardinal such that ~I 0 < k < 2 I% and 
let <At:/ < k> be a family of infinite pairwise almost disjoint subsets of

Let S C k then there is anf:w-*

uA~ U W, f tAt~=ae l&~wheni~eS

then f r At~ =ae 0A~. 
The partial order on P is proper inclusion. 

56 
Let us prove 
now that 
P 
satisfies the 
e.c.e. Let ~f~ :i <t~l~ 
be a 
sequence 
of 
members 
of 
P. 
For 
f~ 
let 
Dom (f~) : Aa(i,1) U"" 
U Aa(i,n(i)) U Wi, a(i,1), a(i,2) --. <~. Let k~ E co be 
such that 
k~ is a strict upper bound 
of W i and for each g, 1-<g ~n(i), 
A=(i,e) N kr contains a number m such that fr 
= fi(m) 
for every number 
c Aa(i,s 
which is > m. 
There is such a k i since each fr t Aa(i,g) has the 
value 0 almost everywhere or the value 1 almost everywhere. 
We 
demand 
in 
addition 
that 
for 
1 --< g, 
m --< n (i) s ~ m, 
Aa(i,s (-1 let ~- Aa(i,m) ('~ ki and Aa(i,~) ('~ Aa(t,rn ) ~ ]c~ without loss of generality 
we can assume that for all i <tO 1 n(i) is fixed, i.e., n(i) =n for i <t~l, kr is 
fixed, i.e., kt =k 
for i <t~ 1 for 1--<g----n Aa(i,s 
C~k is fixed for fixed g and 
fr 
iisfixe 
and Wt is fixed. We shall now prove that for i #ji,j 
<--Slfr and 
fj are compatible. 
Consider the union ft U fj. 
If this union is a function it 
obviously belongs to P. Suppose 
it is not a function. Since fr t k = fjt ]c 
there 
is 
a 
~ -> k (6 < ~) 
such 
that 
f~ (~) # fj (fl). 
Since 
W~ : 
%. tic 
fl ~ W~ : ~., 
hence 
for 
some 
1-<g,gl <-n 
flcAa(~,~) 
and 
fl c Aa(j,~.t). Let m = Max 
Aa(i,~) N k, since/c f~ Aa(i,s 
contains a number so 
that f~ is fixed from that number 
upwards we have fi(fl)= fr 
Since 
CA i : i < t~l) is a tree and fl < Aa(i,~. ) ~ Aao.~), fl ~ k, we have g : s 1 and 
therefore 
m = Max 
Aa(j,~t) ~ k and, as for i, fj(fl) = fj(m). 
Since m < k 
and fr r k : fjt 
]c we have fi(m) 
: fj(m) 
hence fi(fl) = fj(fl), contradicting 
our choice of ft. 
Looking at the proof of Theorem 3.5 it is clear how to choose dense sub- 
sets ~) of P such that if G is a directed subset of P which intersects each one 
of 
them 
then 
g = U G 
has 
the 
following 
properties: 
Dom(g)

g rAr =ae 1A~fori c~--Sg 
rA/ =ae 0~. 
3.10 Theorem: In 3.9 "A~ c ~"is not required, provided ]A~ I - S0. 
The proof is analogous to the proof of theorem 3.7. 

w The uniformization property. 
57 
Let us present now the setting with which we shall deal with the problem 
3.6. 
4.1 Definition: Let A = ~ A~: i < a t 
be a sequence of sets, each of which 
is countable and infinite. We say that (A,h) has the uniformization property 
if 
for 
every 
family 
of 
functions 
(fi 
:i <a~ 
such 
that 
fr 
On 
f~(a) < h(a), there is a function f: k/A/ -, On such that for each i < a f~ is 
i<= 
almost included in f 
(i.e., included up to a finite number of values). We shall 
denote 
kJ At with D(A) , so Dom h = D(A). If h is constantly/~ we write (A,/~) 
if /~--2we writeA. 
We shall say thatAis 
a tree if there is a partial order < 
on 0(4) such that: 
a) ~D(A),<> 
is a tree such that for all x e.D(A) 
lY :Y <x]isafinite 
set linearly ordered by < 
b) For each i A~ is a branch in/)(A) , i.e., if x 9 A i and y < x then also 
y 9 Ai. Since each A~ is infinite and since by a) (D(A),<~ 
is of height -----co, 
each A~ is a maximal branch, i.e., it goes all the way up. 
We shall denote ~D(A),<~ 
with T . T n will denote the n-th level of T, 
Tn = I x " I|Y :Y <xl =nl. 
For a branch A we denote with (A)[~] the only 
member of A in the level n, i.e., the only member of A (3 Tn. 
4.2 Theorem= If A = (A~:i < a), a ~- co 1, is a tree in the above sense and 
if D(A) c ~>2 then A does not have the uniformization property. 
Proof: Let us define the function fi on A~ as follows. 
f/((A~)[n]) = (A/)[n+l](n). We notice that (Ai)[n ] is a sequence of length n. The 
value of fi for this member of D(A) tells us which way the branch goes at 
(A/)[n ], right or left, since 
(Ai)[n.1] = (A~)[n]."~(Ar 
= (A~)[n]^~fi((A~)[n])). 

58 
Assume now that there is a [unction f 
uniformizing all fj's, or even all f~'s 
for some uncountable 
set I ~ a. 
For each i c I let n(i) 
be such that 
y~(',') = f(x) 
for every x c A~ of level > n(i). 
Since I is uncountable there is 
an ~z* < ~ such that li c I : n(i) = n ~ is uncountable, we denote this set with 
11. Since D(A) has at most 2 n" members of level n ~ there is a z c T,~ such 
that ~i c I x : (A~)[n. ] = z ] is uncountable; we denote this set with I 2. For all 
i,j ~ I 2 we have (As)in, ] = z = (Aj)[n, ] and since A~ and Aj are branches we 
have (As)I~ ]=(Aj)[~] for allk-<n~ 
Fori 
#j 
i,j cA eA i andAj are different 
branches hence there is at least s ~ ~ n ~ such that (A~)[e+i ] # (Aj)[e§ ] since 
s < n ~ = r~(i) = n(j) 
we 
have 
f~((A~)[e]) = f ((A~)[~]) 
and 
fj((A~.)[e] ) = f ((Aj)[e]). By the definition of f~ and fj we have 
l 
= 
= 
(I 
((&))[~]~ = (A~)lel^(f((A~)[e])~ 
(since (&)[el = (A;)[e] by the minimality 
of s +1) = (Aj)[~] ^(f~((Ai)[e]) ~ = (Ai)l~+l ], contradicting (A~)[e+l ] # (A~)[~+l]. 
4.3 Theorem= Assume MA. Suppose A = ~ A~:i < ~ 
is a family of pair- 
wise almost disjoint countable sets and ~, < 3 n~ Then (A,lh0) has the uniformi- 
zation property provided that: 
(*) for every countable A, li < k:A F~ Ai is infinite I is countable. 
Proof: Let f~:A~ -* ~ for i < A, and we shall find f, almost extending 
each 3'~. Let 
P= 
~f: there 
are 
/~ ..... 
/~ <A 
such 
that 
Domf 
=A h U"'uA~, 
Range (f) c ~, jr almost extend f~ for s = 1 ..... 
n| 
ordered by inclusion. 
It suffices to prove that P satisfies the c.c.c., and proceed as in e.g. 3.5.; 
but this is not hard (proof similar to 3.9). 
4.4 Dimcu~ion. Theorem 4.2 assert that if D(A) is a tree which at each 
node branches into at most two branches then A does not have the uniformi- 
zation property (the fact that in the theorem D(A) was actually a subset of Q2 
is obviously irrelevent). 
The assumption in the theorem that D(A) is a tree 

59 
can be replaced by the following weaker assumption. For each i < a let A/ be 
given as a sequence of type ~0 which we write as (ai,0,atA,.-.) 
= A t . The 
weaker hypothesis is that A is uncountable and for each sequence 
( b 0 ..... 
bn_1) 
of 
members 
of 
D(.4) 
the 
set 
: 
.
.
.
.
.
 
.
.
.
.
.
 
has 
at most 
two  
embers. 
for all At given ar 
..... 
~.n-1 there are at most two possibilities for ar n. 
(This assumption obviously holds if D(A) is a tree with branching as above 
and each sequence (o~,o,acA , 9 9 9 ) 
is such that ar n = (A,)[~] for all n < co). 
We shall see that also under this weaker assumption A does not have the uni- 
formization property. 
Let 3 be as above. For eachi<a 
let Be =|(a,, 0 ..... 
ar 
:n <c0 I, 
B = (B~ :i < a). 
B is obviously a tree which at each node branches to at 
most 
two 
branches, 
and 
for 
i # j B~ ~ t7t 
since 
A t ~ A 1. 
Let 
<A : A:B~ ~ ~0,11> be a farmly of function which cannot be uniforr~zed, by 
the 
theorem. 
We 
denne 
a 
fa~ly 
<g,:g,:At~t0.1~> 
as 
follows. 
gi(aLn ) = j',(ar 0 ..... 
a~,=). We shall see that this family cannot be unifor- 
mized. Suppose g:D(A) -* ~0,11 uniformizes this family. Define f on D(B) as 
follows, f((a~, o ..... 
at.,_1>) =g(a~,,~_ 0 if n < 0 and f((~) 
can be given 
any value. We shall see that f 
is an uniformization of (f,: 
i < a>. 
Given 
i <a we know that for some k <r 
we have, for all n >k gr 
=g(a%n ) 
hence, 
by 
the 
definitions 
of 
gr 
and 
f 
..... 
: 
.
.
.
.
.
 
Let us remark now that the theorem is true also for a tree D(A) which has 
a bounded branching at each node (and hence also in the more general case 
mentioned above). We shall show it here for the case where D(A) ~ ~>q, which 
is sufficiently general to exhibit the proof of the general case. For a natural 
number k let d~(k) denote the coefficient of 2 ~ in the binary expansion of k, 
de.(k ) E 10,1~ . We define now on the branch Ai~ 
two functions fo and f l 
by setting fr162 
= d~((At)[n+l](n)), for t~ = 0,1. Let f~ be the function 
uniformizing the functions ~f~ "i < a) for g = 0,1. Let n~ 
and I be such 
thatlca, 
II[ >N0 
(At)[n- ]=z 
fori EIandf~(n) 
=f~(n) 
forn>n 
~ 

60 
the proof of the theorem). We get now a contradiction from the fact that for 
i,j e [ i ~ j there is a least level where .4/ and Aj go to their separate ways, 
while at each node (from level r~* and above ) f0 and f i determine com- 
pletely the way the branch goes in the next level so A t and A 3. must go the 
same way. 
We 
deal here 
exclusively with trees A 
and 
other systems 
where 
ID(A)I =M0. In 3.8 we dealt with a different definition of a tree, namely we 
called a family Ir of subsets of ca a tree of for all x,y 9 ICif n 9 FlY then 
z ~r~ =y t~z. In this case let us define <* on ~ by /e <~163 if /e <s and for 
every A c 6) if IZ eA 
then also k 9 
It is easily seen that <* is a partial 
order; the set I/c : k <*hi is linearly ordered by <* which coincides with < on 
this set and that each A c ca is a branch in the tree <co,<*>. Thus a tree in 
the sense of 3.8 is also a tree in the present sense. 
Now let A be a tree as defined here with ]D(2~) I = t~0 with <* as the partial 
order relation of the tree. 
Identify the members 
of D(A) with the natural 
numbers 
in such a way that if k <*~ then k <JZ. Now suppose n 6A~ NAj 
and k <~z k cA~. SinceA~ isa branch of the tree we havek 
<*r~ orn 
<*k. 
r~ <*k 
would imply n <k, 
hence k <'~z. 
Since also Aj is a branch, n cAj 
and k <* n we get also k e Aj. Since this works in both directions we have 
A~ f~ n = Aj N n. Thus a tree in the present sense is isomorphic to a tree in 
the sense of Definition 3.8.

Let us see now that P satisfies the c.c.c. Let < Wf : t < l~l> be a sequence

4.6 Theorem: It is consistent that there is a tree A = 4Aa :a < ~I> 
such that I D(A) ] = I~ 0 and A has the uniformization property. 

63 
Proof: Let T be a tree, IT] =~0, Tn is finite for n <c0 and for all 
x ~_ T n ] lY c Tn+ l:y >x]] >_2 nz. We shall obtainagenericextensionof 
Vin 
which there is a tree A of length ~1 which has the uniformization 
property. 
We saw above that if the branching 
of a tree at each node is bounded the tree 
does not have the uniforlnization property. 
Here we shall see that if at level 
~z each node branches', to 2 n~ branches 
the tree may have the uniformization 
property. There is a gap here which one should narrow or even eliminate. 
First one introduces t~ 1 generic branches 
of T by the following set Q0 of 
conditions 
Q0 = If : f is a finite function on r 
x r such that: 
<a,n> 
• Dom (f) -* f (a,n) e r n ^ 
<a,x+'> EDom(f)-~<a,n> cDom(f)^ 
! (~,n) < ! (~,n +i)I 
The partial order relation on Q0 is proper inclusion. If G is a generic sub- 
set of O01etF= 
t, JG,A a= IF(a,n)'n <r 
andA=<Aa:a 
<c01>. Awillbe 
the tree which has the uniformization 
property 
(it is obvious that for a # fl, 
a,~<~ 1 
A,t#A#, 
since 
the 
subset 
If CQo:~n[<a,n>,<fl,n> 
c Dom (f) ^ f (a,n) # f (fl,n)]] of Q0 is dense in Q0)- 
The next step is to carry out an iterated forcing so that in each step a 
different system g = <g,: i < r 
g,:A~ -, 10,1] get uniformized. Eventually 
we obtain that A has the uniformization property. 
We shall describe first only 
a single step of this iterated forcing . The conditions we use now are the fol- 
lowing. Let g be the name of a system of functions as above in the forcing Q0- 
We define Q(g) = Ih : h is a finite function fromt~ 1 to co ^ Va,~ff c dora (h) the 
functions g,, r |x c Aal height (x) -> h(a)l and 
g~ t ~x E A#] height (x) -~ h(fl)] are compatible ]. 
The partial order relation on Q(g) is proper inclusion. 
This forcing is done 
over V[G0], where G O is a generic subset of Q0. Let G be a generic subset of 
Q(g) and H = (JG. We. can now define the uniformizing function g:T --, ~0,1] 

64 
as follows. For x 9 T if x 9 A a and heigth (x) -> H(a) then g(x) = ga(x); if x 
belongs to no A a such that H(a) <- height (x) we define g(x) arbitrarily. If 
x 9 Aa, height (x) -> H(a) and also, for fi # a, x 9 A~ and height (x) -> H(fi) 
then 
since 
G is directed 
and H= UG 
there 
is an 
h c G 
such 
that 
a,fl 9 dora (h),. h(a) = H(a) and h(fl) = H(fl). Since h 9 Q(g), 
h(a),h(fl) <- 
height x we have, by the definition of Q~) 
ga(x) = g~(x), so that g(x) is well 
defined. It is obvious from the definition of g that it uniforrnizes all ga's for 
a<~ 
I. 
Dom tp 2 -- 
p "speak" 
domain of 
Let us consider now the set Q0 * Q(g) and prove that it satisfies the c.c.c. 
Let W be an uncountable 
subset of Q0 * Q(g). 
Each <p,q> c Qo * Q(g) is 
first extended as we shall tell. If two of the extended conditions will turn out 
to be compatible then the corresponding original conditions are compatible 
too. First we extend p to pl which decides exactly the value of q (q is the 
name of a finite subset of ml x ~), so we shall now regard q as a finite func- 
tion from ol to m and not as a name. Then we extend p 1 to P2 so that the 
|a : (:~n)[<a,n> 9 Domp2]{ (which is the set of branches on which 
) will include the domain of q. Now we extend q to ql so that the 
ql will be equal to the Dora ?p2 i.e., P2 and ql will mention exactly 
the same branches out of A. 
(This can be accomplished by adding to the 
name q names of the required members of V whose interpretation 
is fixed 
and does not depend on the generic set G.) Let Ip denote 
i.e., the set of 
indices 
of 
the 
branches 
about 
which p 
contains 
information. 
For 
a 
sufficiently large 
c e ~ 
we 
can 
extend 
P2 
to 
P3 
so 
that 
c > I/p,], 
Dom(p3) =/p~• l0 ..... 
c| and p3(i,c) #p3(j,c) 
for i,j 9 
i #j 
(i.e., 
different i e/p~ are indices of branches 
of A which branch off from each 
other at a level up to level 2 ), and c "~ql(i) fori 9 
From now on we shall 
assume that all the members of W have the properties of <Pa,ql). 
Using the standard technique we can delete members from W so as to 
obtain a set W with the following properties. There are a c < ~, a finite subset

occur. By our choice of fl and 7 g~(~(ka,m)) = g~t, (P~(lce,m))' hence 
gi~(l~(k~,m)) # gil(p"(ke,m)) while y(k~,m)=iff(kz,m ), but this shows 
that ~p ~ 
is not a condition in Qo * Q(7), which is a contradiction. 
This of course does not yet prove theorem 4.6. If we want to carry on the 
iteration, somehow imitating the scheme of Martin's axiom, we should do two 

66 
things: first isolate some property of <Ar : i < r 
in V Q~ a property which is 
the "reason" why Q(g) is c.c.c. Then we should enonciate a property 
of forc- 
ing notion which would ensure the property of <A~ :i < c01~ is preserved, at 
last we should show by induction on a ~ ~2 that the iteration of Q(g) over all 
names for candidates 
has the desired property. 
Where by candidate we mean

Maximal almost disjoint families of subset of co. 
By a mad ( maximally almost disjoint) subset of/9(co) we mean an infinite 
subset F of SP(co) such that for all x,y 9 F Ix l --~0 Ix n y l < ~ and for 
every z 9 ]9(co) there exist x 9 F such that I z (3 x I = S0- 
5.1 Theorem: There is a mad subset of SP(a)) of cardinality 2 s~ 
Proof: Replace by the set of all nodes of the full binary tree, i.e., with 
the set of all finite sequences 
of O's and l's. This tree has 2 ~~ branches 
and 
every two of them are almost disjoint. Extend the set of all branches 
to a 
mad set by Zorn's lemma. 
5.2 Theorem= No countable subset of SP(r 
is mad. 
Let < at: i < co> be a sequence of infinite pairwise almost disjoint sub- 
sets of co. For eachi < co we have a i - 
gaj 
=a t - 
K2aj 
~ 
ai, and since each 
j<~ 
j<i 
set aj Aa~ 
is finite and 
a t 
is infinite there 
is an X~ 9 t -Uaj. 
For 
j <i 
Xj 9 aj while)Q ~ aj hence Xj ~X/, therefore the set b : IX~ :i <w] is 
an infinite set. Since fori 
<j 
X~ ~aj 
we have b (3 aj cIX 0 ..... 
Xj]. Thus 
the intersection 
of b with each aj is finite and therefore 
la i : i < co| is not 
mad. 
If the continuum 
hypothesis holds then there are mad sets of cardinality 
L9%= ~1 and of no other cardinality. 
If the continuum 
hypothesis 
does not 
hold we are faced with the question whether there are mad sets of cardinali- 
ties -> 11 t but 
< 2 I%. 
5.3 Theorem= Martin's axiom implies that every mad set is of cardinality 
~0. 
Proof: Let F be an infinite set of infinite pairwise almost disjoint sub- 

69 
sets of ~0, IF I <2 M~ . Let PF = I<a, t) 
: a is a finite subset of c0 and t is a 
finite subset of Ft.

The meaning of the condition ~ a,t> 
is that the set w which we con- 
struct will include a, but for every u c t w (3 u = a F5 u, so no new members 
of u will be in w (other than those already in a). 
If Ca,t> 
<a,s>

Since there are only ~0 finite subsets 
of ~ every subset of PF of pairwise incompatible members must be countable, 
and the c.c.c, holds.

of ~)n hence A con- 
tains a number

70 
Thus we have constructed 
an infinite set A which is almost disjoint from 
every member of F, and hence F is not mad. 
5.4 Theorem: If V does not satisfy the continuum 
hypothesis and A is a 
cardinal such that t~ 1 <-- A < 2 t% in V then V can be generically extended by a 
c.c.c, extension which preserves also 2 I% to one extension V[G] where there is 
a mad subset of/9(r 
of cardinality X. 
Proof: We start with a sequence 
in V (A a : a < ~,~ of almost disjoint 
subset of ~ (there is such by Theorem 5.1). Now we proceed with a system of 
iterated 
forcing of length ~1 as follows. At step a we assume that we have 
constructed 
a sequence 
(At: i < A + a> 
of pairwise almost disjointed sub- 
sets of ~. We take F a=~At :i <A+a] 
and we use at this step the forcing 
notion PF,, where PF is as in the proof of Theorem 5.3, and we introduce 
by 
means of it a new subset AA+ a of co almost disjoint with each member of F a. 
(this follows immediately from the proof of theorem 
3). Since PF,, is a c.c.c. 
forcing our iterated 
forcing is c.c.c. 
For PF, we can use, instead of pairs 
(a,t) 
where a is a finite subset of ~ and t is a finite subset of F a, such pairs 
where t is a finite subset of A + a and each i 9 t stands for the corresponding 
At. Thus each PFo will consist of sets of V (while its partial order is not neces- 
sarily in V), and the cardinality 
of PF,, is therefore 
Max (a,A) = A. For the 
iterated forcing we can use only standard 
names in the set P of conditions, 
hence 
I P] = A. Since P is a c.c.c, forcing standard 
arguments 
show that 
]p(~)l(v[g]) = (h) I%(10 __ (A t%vlc] _< (2t%) I%(I0 = 3 It(V), hence in V[G] 2 I% is the 
same as in V. 
Finally let us prove that IA a:a 
<A+~I] 
is a mad subset of ]~). 
Let 
A Cco, A 9 V[G]. For eachn

is mad. We shall show that if A C~ Aa is finite 
for every ~ < A +a then A ~ A a is infinite. 
This follows from the following 
lemma, which ends the proof. 
5.5 Lemma : Let F be a set of pairwise disjoint subsets of c0, and let 
Bcc0be 
such that for every subsetF 
t of F 
B-U 
Ft is infinite. Let G be a 
generic subset of PF over V and let A be the union of the first components 
of 
the members of G, then A C~ B is infinite. 
Proof: For every n 
let Dn = I<a,t> 
ePr:(am->n) 
m eB 
Nai. 
We 
shall see that 
is dense. 
Let <b,t> 
c 
By our assumption 
B - UT is 
infinite hence it contains an m ->n. 
<a 
U [ml,t> 
e~bn and since m ~ U t 
<a 
ulml,t> 
> ><a,t>. 
SinceDn 
is dense G contains some<a,t> 
9 
hence A Da 
and A contains 
an m 9 
minn. 
Since this holds for every 
n < ~ A f~ B is infinite. 
We 
shall 
prove 
that 
essentially 
all 
countable 
forcing 
notions 
are 
equivalent. 
If one carries out the proof of the last theorem 
for the case 
where a = t~ 1 , but one starts with a sequence <A~ : i < ~> of pairwise about 
disjoint subsets 
of ~ then 
each PF is a countable 
forcing and therefore 
equivalent to the addition of a Cohen Real. Thus the iterated addition of t~ 1 
Cohen Reals yields an extension of V with a mad set of cardinality t~ i. But the 
iterated extension of t~ 1 Cohen Reals is the same as the simultaneous 
addition 
of t~ i Cohen Reals. 
5.6 TheorerIx Every two countable 
forcing notions where above every 
condition there are two incompatible conditions are equivalent. 
Proof: Let P be the set of all finite sequences of natural numbers 
ordered by proper inclusion and let Q be a countable forcing as in the 
theorem. We shall show that P and Q are equivalent by constructing an iso- 

72 
morphism F of P on a dense subset of (~. We shall define F(W), for 7/c P, by 
induction on the length of W- F(0) = 0, where 0 is the minimal membr of Q. 
Let Q = Iq~:n 
< ~]. 
We shall take 
care 
to satisfy the 
following in the 
definition. 
(i) For every 7) c P IF(w A <i>) : i < ~] is a maximal set of 
incompatible members of Q greater than F(~7). 
(ii) For every n there is an 77 c P of length n + 1 such that F(W) -~ qn. 
We assume, 
as an induction 
hypothesis, 
that 
IF(q): 
length 
(W) = n{ 
is 
predense in P. If (i) holds, let q c Q, then by the induction hypothesis there 
is an W of length n 
such that F(W) is compatible 
with q. 
Let q* >- q,F(w). 
Since, by (i), IF(w ^ <i>) : i < ~] is a maximal set of incompatible members of 
Q above F(~?), qt is compatible with some F(W ^ <i>). 
Thus the set IF(t) : 
length (~) = n+l] 
is predense too. To define F(W ^ <i>), for all i < r 
define a 
set ~9 of pairwise incompatible members of Q above F(W) as follows. If lenghth 
(7) =n 
and 
F(W) is compatible 
with qn 
let to~-F(w),qn, 
otherwise 
let 
to-> F(W). Let t~,s 1 be two incompatible members 
of Q greater than t o and, 
by induction, let tn+l,Sn+ 1 be two incompatible members of Q greater than sn. 
Take T = Itn : i - n < c01, T is a set of pairwise incompatible members, and if 
F(~?) is compatible withgn then each member 
of T is -~ gn. Let T be a maxi- 
mal set of pairwise incompatible members 
above F(W) which includes T. T is 
countable, 
since 
Q 
is, 
and 
we 
define 
the 
F(W ^ <i>)'s 
so 
that 
~F(w^<i>):i 
<~] = T. Since (ii) holds[F(w) 
: w c P] is a dense subset of Q. 
Using the method 
of Theorem 5.4 we can extend 
V so that in the exten- 
sion for every I such that 1~ 0 < X --< 2 s~ there is a mad subset of cardinality X. 
To do this let (k a " a </z> be the cardinals t~ 0 < h < 21% in increasing order. 
For a </z we construct 
a mad subset 
IAt a:i 
<k a+r~tl 
of p(co) as follows. 
lAt a : i < k.] is a family of pairwise almost disjoined subsets of ~. We extend 
V by iterating /~. ~1 times and at the step of ordinal/z,i 
+ a we add the set 
A~+ 1 -- r as an almost disjoint set of IA/a : j < k a + i]. 

]]I PROPER FORCING 
@1 Introducing properness 
1.1 Discussion: When we iterate we are faced with the problem 
of 
obtaining for the iteration the good properties of the single steps of iteation. 
Usually the worst possible vice of a forcing notion is that it collapses t~ t. The 
virtue of not collapsing l~ 1 is not inherited by the iteration from its single 
coml~onents. 
As we saw, the virtue of the c.c.c, is inherited by the FS itera- 
tion from its components. 
However the c.c.c, is too strong a requirement. 
We 
shall look for a weaker requirement which is more naturally connected to the 
property of not collapsing I~ l, and which is inherited by iterations. 
We shall now study a certain generalization of the concepts of a closed 
unbounded 
and a stationary subset of ~l. They were introduced and investi- 
gated by Jech and Kueker. 
1.2 Definition: For A uncountable 
let 
SI~o(A ) = Is :s CA,]s] <--1%1. 
If c 
S#0(A ) is called closed if it is closed under unions of increasing c0- 
sequences. 
If c 
~t%(A) is called unbounded 
(in 
~I%(A)) if for every 
s ~ 
SRo(A) there is a t ~ t~ such that t ~ s. 
1.3 I~mma: The intersection of t~ 0 closed unbounded 
subsets Ir i, i < o, 
of 
SR0(A) is a closed unbounded subset of 
SI%(A). 
Proof: Since each set lqt is closed the intersection 
FI ~ is obviously 
closed too. Let us prove now that 
AWi is unbounded 
too. Let s c 
SI%(A); 
we have to prove the existence 
of a t Ds, 
t c F~ W~. We shall define a 

74 
sequence ~sa:a 
< co ~) of members 
of 
~t%(A) as follows, s o = s, for a > 0, 
a = r 9 k + s 
s a 
is 
an 
arbitrary 
member 
of 
W~ 
which 
includes 
(J s a c 
~t%(A); it exists as W~ is Unbounded. 
We take now t = 
U sa- Obvi- 
p<a 
a<co z 
ously f ~s o =s. 
For a fixed i <co and every a<~0 2, let a=co-k 
+s 
then 
a < co(k+l) + i, hence, by the definition of s~(k+l)+, 
s a = s~(~+i)+~. 
There- 
fore f = 
U sa = U so.~+~- The sequence (so.~+ ~ :/c < co) is a nondecreasing 
a<co a 
/, <co 
~-sequence 
of members 
of Wi, and since W, is closed also its union t is in ~. 
Thus t c f~ W~, which is whaL we had to prove. 
subsets of

1.4 Definition: By the last lemma we know Lhat the closed unbounded 
subset of 
Se0(A ) generate 
an sl -complete 
filter, namely the filter of all 
S~0(A) which include a closed unbounded 
set. We denote this 
DM0(A ). A subset of 
S~o(A ) is called stationary if it meets every 
S 
0(A), i.e., if it meets 
every member 
of 
We shall now present 
the lemma which says thaL for ~] = Sl 
S#o(A) 
and 
D0(A) do not differ significantly from ~1 and the filter Do, generated by 
the closed unbounded 
subsets of co 1. 
1.5 Lemma: A subset of r 
is a closed unbounded 
subset of ~1 (in the 
usual sense of a closed unbounded 
subset of an ordinal) iff it is a closed 
unbounded 
subset of 
SB0(~I). 
Proof: Easy. 
We shall now introduce a more restricted set of generators 
for 
D0(A ). 

75 
1.6 Definition: M will denote an algebra, with universe A, and with 
countably many functions. Let 
Sm(M) = [s : s ~ A,Is I ~o, 
s is closed under the operations of M], i.e., 
Sm (M) is the set of countable subalgebras of M. Srn (M) is obviously a closed 
unbounded subset of 
--~-~ 0(A). 
1.7 Lemma: For every closed unbounded subset W of 
S~0(A ) there is 
an algebra M on A such that Sm (M) C W. 
Proof: We shall define, for every finite sequence ~ = (a 0 ..... 
an_it 
of members 
of A, by induction 
on the 
length n, s(~)~ 
W such that 
s(a) ~ [a o ..... 
a~_ 1] and s(a) ~ s((a 0 ..... 
a~_l~ ). This is obviously pos- 
sible because W is unbounded. 
We define now n-place functions F~, s < r 
for all ~ <co such that s((a o ..... 
an_l~ ) = 
|F~(a 0 ..... 
an_l) :s <c0]. 
LetM=~A,F~tn<~,r 
~. Let S=|ao,al,..-| 
be a subalgebra of M. Denote 
Sn = s((a 0 ..... 
an_l~ ) = {F~(a 0 ..... 
a.n_l) : s < (hi. We have: 
a) Sn C S, since s is a subalgebra. 
b) S n C Sn+ ,, by definition of s((a 0 ..... 
ant ). 
c) an < S~§ 
d) S~ r W. 
By (a) and (c) we have S = (J S~; by (b) and (d) weget SE W. Thus we have 
show Srn (M) C W. 
We have now seen that the filter 
D0(A ) is generated by all sets SIn(M) 
where M is an algebra on A as above. We shall now see one use of this fact. 
1.8 Theorem= Let P • V be a poser which satisfies the c.c.c., let ~, be an 
uncountable cardinal, and let G be a generic subset of P over V. Every 

76 
closed 
unbonded 
subset 
B 
of 
~B0(X)(v[G]) in V[G] includes 
a 
closed 
unbounded 
subset of 
S 0(k)(v) in V. Thus 
D~o(k)(v[c]) is generated by the 
closures of the generators of 
&0(k)(v). 
Proof: By what we have proved above we have the following in V[G]. 
There is an algebra M = <N,F~>n,~<~ such that Srn(M) c B. 
In V the func- 
tion /~ has a name F n. Because of the c.c.c., by Lemma I. 3.6 (ii) for all 
~g 
a 0 ..... 
an_ 1 < X we know in V the countable 
set of possible values of 
I~(a o ..... an_l). We define the functions F~, k so that these ~0 values are 
IF~,~(a 0 ..... 
an_l) : k < c0]. 
So 
we 
have,, 
for 
all 
n,g < co 
and 
a0 ..... 
a~-i 
< x 
~(a0 
..... 
a~-l) 
c 
I~.~(a0 
..... 
a~-l) 
: ~ < ~. 
So 
N = <h,/v~,~>n,~,~<a is an algebra in V and every subalgebra of N is clearly a 
subalgebra of M. We have SIn(N) (v) ~ Sm(M) (vIal) ~ B, SIn(N) (v) is a closed 
unbounded 
subset of 
~o(X)(v) in V, and the closure SIn(N) v in V[G] is 
Sm (N) v[G] c B. 
A consequence 
of this theorem is that for a c.c.c, extension V[G] of V 
every stationary 
subset of 
S 
D(X)(w) in V is also a stationary 
subset of 
SB(X) (v[c]) in V[G]; in short, the extension does not destroy the stationar- 
ity of stationary subsets of 
S~o(k ). We shall use this property to define the 
concept 
of proper 
forcing. While it is a consequence 
of the fact that 
/) D(x)VlC] is generated by the closures of the members of 
Do(A) V is does 
not seem to require as much. 
1.9 Definition: A forcing notion P is called proper if for every (uncount- 
abld) cardinal X, forcing with P preserves stationarity modulo 
D (~). 
We 
~0 
shall denote this condition for X with Conl(k ). Note that Conl(So) is meaning- 
less, or trivially true if you want. 

77 
Note that properness is preserved by equivalence of forcing notion. 
1.10 Theoren~ 1) P is proper iff the following condition holds for each 
cardinal ~. 
Con2(A): For all iP~J : J < a~,i < a] ~ P such that a ~ A and a~ -: A for i < a, 
and suchthatforalli<a 
~pr :j <a i ] is predense in P, and for all p 9

and 
|p~j :j <ai, j 9

predense 
aboveq for anyi9 
i <a]] 9 
D 0(~t ). 
2) Moreover, for any Am [P] § 
C~ 
is equivalent to Cona(h); and if P 
is a complete Boolean algebra without 1 then Con l(h) is equivlaent to Con2(~ ) 
for every uncountable h. 
Proof: We assume first - Con2(k), i.e., there are a ": ~, 
a, - h for i < a, 
IPi,i"J < ai{ is predense in P 
and p 9 P 
such that the set 
T of all 
s 9 
SB0(A ) for which 
-(:~(q EP)[q >_p and [pij :j <a~,j cs ! is predense above q for any 
i cs,i <a] is stationary. 
Let GCP 
be a generic subset of P such that 
p c G. G meets every predense set hence there is in V[G] a function f on u 
such that p~,l(~)c G for all i <a. 
For the 
algebra <h,f> 
we have 
Srn(<k,f>) c 
/) 0(k)(vIa]). We shall show that T A Srn(<k,f>) 
= ~b thus T 
which is stationary 
in 
V 
is no longer stationary in V[G]. 
Assume 
s e T N Sm((h,f)), 
then, as T e V, clearly s e V. Since s is closed under f 
we have V[G] ~(Vi Es) (i <a-*(3j cs)(j <a i^p~J c G)), hence some 
r E G forces this statement. Since G is directed and p E G there is a q c G 
q >-p,r hence q [~(Vi cs)(i <a-*(~j cs) (j <a~AP~d C G)). 
Therefore 
for everyics, 
i <a 
|PiJ :J <a~nj cs| ispredense above q (if this were 
not the case then for some q-> q, q is incompatible with each member of 
IP~j : J < a, n j E s] for some i c s, i < a, and for a generic G which contains 
q we cannot have (~j c s)(j < a, ^p~j 9 G)). Thus s satisfies exactly the 
condition of not belonging to T, which is a contradiction. 

7B 
We have proved that -Con2(A ) implies -Conl(A ) . We shall prove that 
Con2(h ) implies Con l(h ) for h-> ]P], or for all ~-~t~ z if P is a complete 
Boolean algebra without 1. This suffices to prove that (Y~,) Con2(A) implies 
(u 
Conl(h ) since, as we shall now see if h >/~t~ 1, Coni(h ) implies Cont(IZ ) 
and if ~ >/~, 
Con2(h ) implies Con1(), ) (see 1.13 , 2.1 resp.) 
For this purpose we shall prove the following lemmas.

Proof: The proof that if W is closed unbounded in 
S~0(A ) then 
W -U

St%(A LJ B)is trivial. Now assume that 
W is stationary in 
St%(A ), and suppose W U

~'B0( A U B). 
Then there is a model M = < A U B,F'~> n,g<~ such that 
(W U

the set of functions |Fr~ :n,s < (o{ is closed under substitution. We define a 
function ~ 
for n-tuples of members of A as follows

b 9

Therefore b gA, hence

S~0( ~ _~)v ~ W is a stationary subset of

S 0(~)v in V[G]. If this is 
not the case then there is a closed unbounded subset C of

~S0(A-~)Vlg] U C is a closed

Continuation of the Proof of 1.10: We return now to the proof that 
Con2(A ) implies Con I(A) for any uncountable ~,-> ]P] or for all A ~ ~1 if P is a 
complete Boolean algebra without 1. Let T be a stationary subset of

denote the restriction of h to n-tuples with h n. Let h~, for s < ~ be a func-

fin-l) = #, if there are such 
conditions and then .9, will be a maximal set of conditions which force 
definite values on F~(fl 0 .....

IP~,j : J < aiJ

that 
~p~,j : j < a~l = .9~. Let

Since [P~j : J c ai f~ s] is predense over q every generic filter G which con-

So 
T is still stationary

1.1fi Observations: It can be seen, by means of Con2(h ) that in order 
that the forcing P be proper it suffices to require Cons(h ), or Conl(X ) for 
some ~ -~ 2 IP] (see Lerllrlla 2.2). We can also replace, equivalently, a,ai <- ~ in

antichains and 21P] by the number of the maximal antichains (see Lemma 2.2

1.6 Lernma: If P is a proper forcing then in V[G] every countable set of 
ordinals is included in a countable 
set of ordinals of V (and hence t~ v is 
uncountable in V[ G]). 
Proof: Let a be a countable set of ordinals in V[G], then for some 
o

S o(~, )

~l%~^j

Is c 
v[C]:s ~a~ is obviously a closed unbounded 
subset of 
St%(A)v[a] 
in V[G] . 
S 
o(A)v is a stationary subset of 
S~0(~)v 
in v hence, since the forcing P is proper, it is also a stationary subset of 
S~o(~)g[c] in V[G]. Thus 
S~(A) g n 
I s c 
S~o(N)v[~] 9 s ] a I # ~ and N has 
a subset countable in V which includes a.

An 
alternative

is 
that

then

W 1 = ~t:s ct 9 S~,(A)I 9

so in V, 
W 0 is stationary, hence it is stationary in V[G] hence W 0 N W1 r 0 
which is just what we need. 
As a consequence, if a is an ordinal such that cf (a) > co in V, we have also 
cf (a) > ~ in V[G].

2.1 Discussion: It is worth noticing that one can use for a set of genera- 
tors of 
/)s0(A) not only the set ~Sm(M) : universe of M = A and M is an alge- 
bra with S0 operations ] but also the somewhat wider set [Sm(M) : universe 
of M = A and M is a partial algebra with n 0 operations ]. This can be done 
since if M is a partial algebra , i.e., an algebra whose operations are not 
necessarily defined for all arguments, then Sm(M) is also a closed unbounded 
subset of m'~"o (A)" 
It is easy to see that for ~ < A,

hence, 
since 
/z < X ^ Cone(h ) -* Cone(/z), therefore (3a =* 2 IPI) (Cone(a)) ==~ YX Cone(X)). 
Proof: 
It clearly 
suffices 
(see 
2.1) 
to 
prove 
that 
for 
h>21PI 
Cone(21Vl )-* Ce~e(X ). Letp, Cp~.j :j <a~, i <a> be as in Con2(k ). Let3~ 
denote the subset [p,,~. "j < a,I of P. Let (~: 
i < 2]Vl>, be a listing without 
recurrence of all subsets of P. Let r q~j :j < fi~> be a listing of the members 
of ~, then we can have fli ~; [P[. We define a partial function F:X -* 2 IPI by 
F(i) = the 7 such that ~7 =-~' 
for i < a. We define also two partial func- 
tions G and H on ~, • X, into X by G(i,j) = the 7 such that Pi,i = qF(~),7, for 
i <a, j <a~, and H(i,3) = the least 7 such that P~,7 =gr(~),/' for i <a, 
J < flF(i)" 
Since Cone(21P] ) holds the set A = Is c 
S#0(21PI ) : (3q =-p)(V 
i c s n P)([qi.j :J c s N ~] is predense above q)] is in 
D o(21PI ). There- 
fore there is a partial algebra M with universe 21PI such that A :~ SIn(M). Let 
N be the partial algebra whose universe is X and whose partial operations are 
those of M together with F,G and H. We shall show that for every s : Srn(N) 
there is a q =*p such that for all its 
Na, 
IP~,j'J cs na~ 
is predense 
over q. This will establish Conf.(A) since the set which is required by Cone(>~) 
to be in 
D0(X ) has been shown to include Srn(N) which is in 
D#0(X ). 
Let s c Srn(N); 
since 
N 
contains all the partial 
operations 
of M 
s n 21PI c ~rn(M). Since Srn(M) C A we have s N 21Vl c A; therefore there 
is a q =* p such that

We shall show that for this q 
(Yi E s n a)([pij :j c s N ar

2.4 Definition: For a cardinal ;k we denote with H(A) the set of all sets 
whose transitive closure is of cardinality 
< A. For a regular uncountable 
k 
<H(h),e> is a model for all axioms of ZFC except maybe for the power set 
axiom. 
2.5 Definition: Let N be an elementary 
substructure of <H(X),E> 
and 
let P e N be a forcing notion. For q e P we say that q is (N,P)-generic, 
(or 
N-generic if it is clear which P we are dealing with), if for every subset .9 of P 
which is predense and is in N 
.9 (~ N is predense above q. 
2.6 Lemma: q is (N,P)-generic iff for every T which is a name of an ordi- 
nal in the P-forcing notion, if T e N then q ]~- " T e N" (i.e., if the name is in 
Nthen 
q forces the value to be in N) ifffor every P-name 
TeN, 
q ]~-"if 
Te VthenTeN" 
N 
Proof: We prove only the first "iff" , the second has the same proof. 
Assume that 
q is N-generic 
and let T e N be a name 
of an ordinal. 
Let 
.9 = [r E P : v ]~- " *r = a", for some ordinal a]..9 
is obviously predense. 
`9 is 

85 
definable from P and T in H(A)0 hence .9 c N. Since q is N-generic, .9 (~ N is 
predense above q. Let f 
be the function on ~ defined by ~f (r) = that a for 
which r ]~- " T = a" then f is definable in H(A) from T, hence f C N. Since 
(~ N 
is 
predense 
above 
q, 
q 1[-"G C~ (-9 N N) # r 
i.e., 
q I[-"(ar ~.gNN) 
r E G'" Therefore ifq c G,T=f(r) 
holdsin V[G],where 
r ~(,9(hN) 
V~ G, Since r oN, alsof(r) 
cN (asf 
oN) thus rcgin 
V[G]. 
Therefore q I[- " T c Y". 
Now assume that 
for every name 
T of an ordinal , if T E N then 
N 
q I~-"T~N". 
Let~NbepredenseinP. 
There is anf 
cH(~)whichmaps 
I~1 onto ~, hence there is such an f 
in N. We take r=Minli'f(i) 
c G]. 
N 
Since~f,PCNand~is 
definable fromf 
and P in H(k), also TeN, 
andTis 
obviously a name of an ordinal. 
By our assumption q I~-"~ E N", hence 
q [t-"(3i cN)(f(i) 
E G)" 
Since f 
maps 
the 
members 
of g ~ 1-91 to 
members of N (~.9, being in N, we have q [[-"(3r a~V~N)(r 
c G)". There- 
fore ,9 V~ N is predense above q which is what we had to prove. 
2.7 Remark: For A~ I P 
it does not matter in Con2(A ) whether we 
require that for each i < a IP~j : J < a~ be predense or whether this set is 
predense above p. On the face of it the version where .we require the 
IPij : J < a~ to be predense is weaker since it makes a stronger assumption, 
but we now prove from it the stronger version. Suppose each lp~j : j < a~] is 
predense above p. 
Blow each such set by adding to it all members of P 
incompatible with p, to get the set IP~,i :J < fl~l. Since ]PI -< A I~il -~ 
so 
we can apply the weak version of Con2(k ) (~ may be > k but since only the 
cardinality figures here it is O.K. as long as fl~ < h+). We obtain a set A in 
/9 (k) such that for s cA we haveaq 
~p for which for eachi cs 
V~athe 
D 
set ~p~j :] •s 
C~fl~ is predense above q. For a~-<j <~,p~,j 
is incompati- 
ble with p and hence also with q, therefore also the set [p~d : j c s (~ a~] is 

86 
predense above q which establishes the stronger version of Con2(A). 
~..8 Theorer~ (1) Let ~, > 2 IPI , ~, regular 
P is a proper forcing notion 
iff for every countable elementary substructure N of (H(A),c> 
such that 
P,p E N there is a p < q c P such that q is N-generic. 
(2) ForA-~21PI 
pert(A), 
P is proper if[ 
IN: N E 
~S"o(H(A))' and there is q ~p 
(g,P)-generic ] c 
~D o(H(A)) 
for everyp c P. 
Proof: (1) Suppose the condition of the theorem holds, and we shall 
prove 
Conz(21PI ). 
Let 
(pij 
: i < a,j < hi> 
be 
as 
in 
Con2(21PI ). 
Let 
N<<H(A),c> be such thatP,p 
<P~.i : i < a 
, j < a~> c N (we can assume 
P E H(A) 
since 
H(~,) contains 
an isomorphic 
copy of P). 
For i oN, 
~i = IP~,j : J < a~] c N since it is definable in H(A) from (pi,j : i < a,j < a~> 
andi. 
Let q ~p be N-generic since IP~j :J <a~] cN and it is predense we 
have that ~i N N = [p~,j : j c N C~ a~] is predense above q. 
Therefore to 
establish 
Con2 (21PI ) 
it 
suffices 
to 
prove 
that 
the 
set 
A-|NC~e 
IPI :N.~H(~),c>,p,P, 
<p~,j :i <a,j <a~> eg, IN[ <#0]isin 
D (21PI). 
The 
set 
A t = IN e S~,(H(A)): N ~ ~H(A),c>, 
P,P, (Pij : i < a , j <hi> c g] is in 
DM0(H(A)) by Theorem 2.3. This 
implies that also A c 
D (21PI), by the technique of using a model with 
~0 
operations closed under composition which we have already used several 
times. 
Now we prove the other direction of the theorem. Assume that P is a 
proper forcing , i.e., Con2(2]P]). Since A > 2 ]PI we can assume that P c H(A). 
In H(~,) there is a family<p~d :i <a,j <a~> a~ 
IF[, 
a<-2 IPI such that 
fo~ i < a ~i = [p~j :j < a~] varies over all the predense subset of P. 
By 
Con2(21PI ) 
there 
is 
a 
partial 
algebra 
with 
universe 
21PI 
such 
that 
Srn(M) C Is eS(21PI) : (~q ~p) 
(u e s N a)IP~,i : J e s N a~| is predense 
over ql. Since there are such~p~,i :i <a,j <a~> and Min H(A) there are 

87 
such also in N. N obviously contains all the natural numbers. 
Since M is 
given as a mapping of ~ on all partial operations of M, all these operations 
belong to N and hence N is closed under them. Therefore N N 21PI 9 SIn(M) 
and therefore there is a q->p 
such that (Yi 9 
Na)(lP~j 
:J 9 
Nazi is 
predense over q). Let `9 be any subset of P in N which is predense in P. 
Since in N it is true that "for every predense subset of P there is an i < a 
such that ,9 =.9~ " (since this is the way we get <pcj:i <a,j <ar 
in N) 
clearly this is true in N. Therefore .9 = .9r for some i 9 N N a. 
For this i, if 
j 9 
then alsop~j 9 
(since <Pij :J 9 
can be taken to be 
one-to-one, 
if 
pij 9 
also 
j 9 
Na~- 
Thus 
~pcj :j 9 
Nar 
= 
{pr 
<ar NN=.gr NN=.gNN and we know that this set is dense 
above q ( since i 9 N N a). Thus we have shown q ->p to be N-generic. 
(2) Left to the reader. 
2.9 Discussion: We shall now present another proof of the fact that if P 
satisfies c.c.c, then it is proper. We shall prove that if T is a name of an ordi- 
.q 
nal, N~<H(A),e> 
and TeN 
then # I~-"TeN". 
There is a maximal 
antichain .9 such that for each p 9 .9, p ~ "T = a" for a unique a. Because 
of the c.c.c. 1`9] ":~0 so we can take `9= ~p~'i <al, 
a<-c0. The sequence 
<pi: i < a> is in H(A) and its properties can be formulated in H(A). There- 
fore there is such a sequence in N. Since ~cN 
we havepr 9 
for every 
i 9 a, and if ai is the ordinal such that pi I]-"T 9 lar :i 9 ~]" 
hence 
r I~-"T~N". 
2.10 Theorem: If the forcing notion P is }Ivcomplete then it is proper. 
Proof: 
Let k be large 
enough, 
i.e., A regular 
and k>2 IPI, let 
p,PeN~<H(h),e>, 
IN[ =~o. Let <.9~:i <r 
be a list of all predense 
sets which are in N. We define the sequence <Pn :~% < w> of members of 
NAP by induction on n: po=p and Pn+l~pn,rn where r n e.gn AN. 
There is such a P~+I e N since Pn+l ][-"Pn is compatible with some members 

88 
of .gn"; 
.9~ being predense 
in N. By the M 1- completenes 
of P there is a q 
such that q ~- Pn for all n < co. q is N-generic since for every predense subset 
.9i of P in N, 
`9n (3N is predense 
above q since q ~r n, 
vn E.gn (3N- 
(A 
set Q is predense 
above q if for every p > q there is a member of Q which is 
compatible with p, but does not have to be > q). 
2.11 Theorem= Let P E N < <H(X),c> 
, and let G be a generic subset of 
P. Let N[G] = IT[G] : r is a name ^ T E N]. Then we have N[G] .< H(v[G])(~,). 
Proof: By repeating 
the Forcing theorems 
for N and .H(k) Claim I 5.17 
implies N[ G] C H(A) v[c]= H(k)[ G]. 
Let ~o(x,y 1 ..... Yn) be a first order

if 
/-/(v[c])(A) ~ (~x) 9(x,y 1 ..... 
yn) for some Yl ..... 
Yn E N[G] then there is 
an z E N[G] such that H(ViCl)(A) ~ ~o(x,y 1 ..... yn). 
Then, by the Tarski- 
Vaught criterion we shall have N[G] -< H(V[c])(X). Since Yl .....

let 
T 1 .....

Then

and q :~p ri then there is an r 9 Pj such that r is (N,Pj)- 
generic, r ~-p and r ~- q and r F i = q. 
For j = 0(*) is vacuously true. Now we assume (*) for j and prove it for j+l. 
Since j+l 9 N also j 9 N. Therefore, since (*) holds for j we may assume, 
without loss of generality that i = j. Let Gj be a generic subset of Pj which 
contains q. 
By Theorem 2.11 we have N[Gi] ~H(A)[Gj] =H(~) v[G~], since 
Pj 9 N (because j, ~ PC,Q: i < a~ 9 N and Pj is definable in H(~,) from j and

Since

also 
P(J) =Pl 9 
and

an r i 9 Qj[Gj] such that r i ~pi[G] and vj is (N[Gj], Qj[Gj])-generic. Since 
the only requirement we had about the generic subset G~. of Pj was that is

By the corollary in 2.13 in order to prove that r is (N,Pj+l)-generic it

Let G c ~Qj[Gj], be the "j-th component

Since rj is (N[Gj], Q[Gj])-generic we have N[Gj][G] N On = N[Gi] F~ On, and 
using the equality above we get N[Gj][G] V~ On =N F~ On. 
We have to

For 

92 
every Pj+vname T in N there is a name YeN 
as in lemma II. 1.5 (Y is 
definable 
from T and 
Pj+I, 
and 
is hence 
in N). 
By Theorem 2.11, 
T[a] = v[aj][~] c N[aj][~], 
Now we come to deal with the case where j 
is a limit ordinal. Let 
('i" n :n < ~> be a sequence of all P~.-names of ordinals which are in N. 
N N J is a countable set, so let i =i 0 <i 1 <--. <in <---,(n

sequence cofinal in it.

q-UplePj 
and q-Upl~'pl

For 
Pl,P2 9 Pj we write p 1 m P2 forpl < P2 ^ P2 ~ Pl. 
We define now two sequences <q~ :n < o> and <pn'n

qo = q , Po = P and foralln <c0:

Let us assume that qn and Pn are defined and that they satisfy (1) - (7).

qt ~ s m qt -(JPn. The set -9o = Is * : s * is incompatible with s, or s ~ -~ s and 
s ~ decides the value of Tn{ is obviously a predense subset of Pj. This set 
belongs to N since it is definable from the parameters s and T n which are in 
N. Let .9 denote the set which consists of the restrictions of the members of 
-9o to/-n. ~q is a predense subset of P~. Since qn is (N,P~)-generic .9 (~ N is

Let r E.gf~N (~ G, then"r

in H(h). 
By Tarski Vaught's criterion there is such an s* in N. 
Thus 
r =s*r/n 
E G, andwe can takeqttobe-~s'r/n. 
Thus qt,s * are as required 
by (a) and (b) . Therefore V[G] ~s*(3qtc 
G)(s* and qt are as in (a) and 
(b) , and s * is the first such element in some fixed well ordering of Pi') By the 
existential

there 
is 
a 
P~-name 
g 
such 
that 
qn [}- (3qt c G) 
[~,q+ are as in (a) and (b) and g is the least such]. Since 
each s * is in N and it satisfies I Dom (s *) ] < ~0 in H(~) it, satisfies it also in N, 
hence Dam i s') c N (since an enumeration of Dora (s*) is in N). We define 
Pn+l as follows. Pn+lri n =Pn t/n. Forycj 
~N-/n 
let Pn+l(7) be thePT- 
name of the member of Q7 determined by g (i.e., if ~ is a set of pairs of 
members of P~ and members of PJ N g then Pn+l(7) = I(r,t> 
: ('Jrt<r):ls 
Now let us define q~+l- For each s c Pj (~ N such that s ~/n ": qn there is 
, by the induction hypothesis an q,~+l(s) E P~,.I such that qn+l(s) t/n = qn, 
qn+l(s) >- s t/n+l and qn+l(s) is (N,Pc,+l)-generic. We define qn+l as follows. 
The domain of qn+l is the union of all the domains of the qn+l(s)'s for s E N 
as above, and since N is countable the domain of qn+l is countable. 
Let 
qn+l[/n =qn. For/~--<7</n+lsuchthatTcDom

then

there is a P~-name ~ of a P~r 
such that qn [}-"(as c Pj 0 N) 
(qn -U s ~ q,~ UPn+l ^ ~ = q,~+l(s))'" 
Now 
~ determines canonically a QT- 
condition, which is taken to be the value of qn+l(7). 

94 
We shall not present here the proof that Pn+l and qn+l thus defined 
satisfies (1) - (7), 
Now we define r = (3 qn- Clearly 
r belongs to Pj. We claim that for 
n ~

Thus, by (7)

w l~artin Axiom Revisited. 
Why is c.c.c, forcing so popular? I think the main reason is that such 
forcing notions preserve cardinalities and cofinalities, so why shall we not be 
interested in the property "'P does not collapse cardinals " instead "P 
satisfies the c.c.c. " ? In particular Magidor and Stavi had wondered on the 
role of the c.c.c, mainly in MA and asked: 
"Is it consistent that for any forcing notion P of power 81 not collapsing 
cardinals 
(i.e., 
81) 
and 
dense 
Dr ~ P (i <81) 
there 
is 
a 
directed 
G~P, 
G nDc~bfori<sl? 
In particular Baurngartner, Harrington and Kleinberg [BHK] proved that if 
S C ~l is stationary co-stationary, and CH holds, then there is a forcing 
notion 
Ps = [C : C 
a 
countable 
closed 
subset 
of 
S! 
C1 ": C2 
iff 
C1 = C2 N (Sup C1§ ) which does not change cardinalities and cofinalities 
and which collapse S ( i.e., collapse its stationarity , i.e., I~-?s "S C co 1 is not 
stationary " 
So why not include such forcing in MA? Because we can find pairwise dis- 
joint stationary sets Sr~ r ~1 , ~1 = 
(J Sn. If we make each Sn in turn not 
stationary, ~o 1 must be collapsed. More exactly, if we try to iterate the foro- 
ings Ps,, after r steps 
81 collapses, no matter how the limit is taken. It does 
not matter if we look at the desired version of MA, in some V and let 
~/)a ~=ICcPs~ 
:Max C~-a~. Thus if G (~)a ~r 
forn <c0 , a<~l, 
then in 
V, each S n is not stationary. 
You can still argue that CH is the cause of the problem but we shall prove 
in theorem 4.4 that even ~0 > 81 , S ~ ai stationary co-stationary there is a 
forcing notion P of power 81, not changing cardinalities and cofinalities but 
still collapsing S. 

96 
So it is natural to change the question to "P of power tl l, not collapsing 
stationary 
subsets of tl i "', and we shall answer it positively, assuming there is 
a model V of ZFC with a strongly inaccessible cardinal. 
The natural scheme is to iterate (by CS iteration) proper forcing of power 
1~ l, in an iteration of length co 2. However to prove the consistency 
of almost 
anything by iterating proper 
forcing we usually have to prove the g-chain 
condition is satisfied, where g will be the new 1~ 2 and the length of the itera- 
tion. 
We have a problem even if I P] =~l , I~-P "IQI =l~l "' 
P * Q have a 
large power because 
of the many names. 
We can overcome this either by 
using g strongly inaccessible, or showing that the set of names which are 
essentially hereditarily countable is dense. 
Another problem is that "not destroying stationary 
subsets of co 1'' is not 
the same as "proper". 
However we shall prove that if P is not proper, then 
]]-c~(~,,2tpl) 
"P destroys a stationary subset of co l''. So instead of "honestly" 
dealing with a candidate 
P i.e., a forcing notion which does not destroy sta- 
tionary subsets of ol, but is not proper we cheat and make it to destroy a sta- 
tionary subset of co 1.

4.1 Theorei~ Suppose Q = <P~,Q 
i < g> is a CS iteration II-p~ 
~Q 
power <g", 
gisregularand(Y/z<g)~~ 
Then P~ = Lira Q satisfies the g-c.c., and each Pi(i < ~) even has a dense 
subset of power < g. Hence for i < g, I]-P~ "28~ < ~". 
Proof: By Lemma I. 5.4 , w.l.o.g, the set of elements of Q. is a cardinal 
/z. < ~; (i.e.,/z. is a P~-name of a cardinal 
< ~). 
For a forcing notion P and P-name 
Q of a forcing notion with set of ele- 
ments/z 
( a cardinal ) we define a hereditary 
countable P-name of a member 
of Q: 

97 
it is the closure of the set of ordinals by the following two operations: 
(a) if ~'n(n < co) are such names, p~ ~ P(n < co) then let T be the T~ for 
the firstn 
, Pn c G , and ~b if there is no such n. 
~p 
(b) if Tn,m(n <~ 
, m <~) 
are such name, let T be the first ordinal 
T <~ 
such that for every n 
, |'rr,,m'm 
< co] is predense 
over T; and ~b if 
there is no such 
We shall prove by induction on ~ ~ g that PI satisfies the g-chain condi- 
tion. 
Suppose this holds for every r < 6, so for r < ~ we have by Lemma I. 3.6 <g 
possible values of ~ 
< g (as ~ is regular). 
Induction on ~- ~ w.l.o.g. ~r =/~r 
(we can add to ~r the ordinal i, 
/~r ,z i </~ 
such that i is m minimal). Let us 
define by P~ = If : f 
a function with domain a countable subset of ~ , je (i) 
is a hereditarily countable Pcname 
of an ordinal </~+l- P~ C P~ inherit its 
order. We now can prove by induction on r 
$, that P~ is a dense subset of 
PC, using the proof that properness is preserved by CS iteration. 
It is clear 
that IP~l <- I~l ~~ so for ~<g, 
P~has 
a dense subset of power <g. 
So we 
finish. 
For $ = g, if p~ c P~ for i < g, clearly S = li < g : cf i = I~l] is stationary, 
f (i) = Sup [i f-I Dompi] < i is a pressing down function, hence on some sta- 
tionary S 1 c S , h has a constant 
value 7- There is a closed unbounded 
C~gsuchthatiffl~ 
C , a<fl. 
ThenDompa~fl. 
SoS 1 f~ C is still station- 
ary, hence 
has power ~ and for a,B c C f"l $1 
, Pa,P~ 
are compatible 
iff 
Pa F7 , P~ r7 are compatible (in P~ or P~, does not matter). 
But we have 
proved that Q7 satisfies the g-chain condition, so we finish. 
4.2 Theorelix Suppose P is not proper, then there is an t~l-complete 
forcing notion Q such that ] Q ] -- 2 IPI and I~-Q " P collapse some stationary 
S ~ ~l "- 

98 
Proof: As P is not proper, there is a stationary S C _~' (~) which P 
0 
destroys, S 0 < ~ ~ 2 IFI. So there are P-names F ~ of n-place functions from 
~n 
to ~, such that I~-p "Srn(<~,F~0,""" >) C~ S = r 
Let Q = Col(Ml,~) = If :f 
a function from some a < el into/~]. 
Fact A: {~-<; "' S is a stationary subset of 
SS0(~ )'' This is because Q is 
s, -complete hence proper. 
Fact B: The statement {~-p "S c 
S s (/~) is not stationary "is absolute, 
0 
i.e., if it holds in V it holds in V Q. 
We just have to check that the P-names #~ continue to satisfy the suit- 
able requirement. 
Fact C: J~-Q " the ordinal ~ has power S 1 '" 
Which is trivial. 
Fact D: If forcing by P destroys a stationary subset of 
SMo(A)(A = ~ in 
our case ), A of power Sl, then forcing by P destroys some stationary subset 
of r 
(follows from Claim 1.12. (3)). 
4.3 Theorem: Suppose ZFC has a model with a strongly inaccessible car- 
dinal ~. Then ZFC has a model in which 2 s~ = S 2 and

This is proved exactly as the parallel fact in Theorem II 3.4. 

99 
Now let [S a : a < ~] be a partion of ~ to ~ sets such that fle S a ==> fl :~ a, and 
]S=[ = ~. 
Define by induction 
on i < ~ a

forcing

Clearly Pi is proper (by Theorem 3.2 and remembering that Col (St,2 #') is S 1- 
complete hence by Theorem 2.10 proper). We still have to check that ]Pi[ < 
but it is easy, note that we use ~<~ = ~ which we have by the first observation 
in this proof and Theorem 4.1. 
Finally also Pz is proper and (again by 
Theorme 4.1 ) satisfy the ~-c.c. which makes it possible to prove V/" ~ (*) 
exactly as in Theorem II 3.4. 
Note that in view of Theorem 4.1 we have a parallel of MA for proper forc- 
ing without assuming an inaccessible. 
4.4 Theorei~ Suppose S c r 
is stationary co-stationary (i.e., ~,-S 
is 
stationary too). 
Then there is a forcing notion Ps which shot a closed 
unbounded 
C c S (i.e., add such a set ) without collapsing cardinals (or 
changing cofinalities). 
Remark: So we cannot answer Magidor Stavi's question positively in the 
original version. 
Remark: Assuming CH this was done by Baumgartner 
, Harrington, 
Kleinberg [BHK] Without CH, Avraham [A] and Baumgartner 
[B] introduce 
forcings notions which add a new closed unbounded 
subset of 
~1 (for 

700 
different purposes). We can adopt each for proving 4.4., and will use a forcing 
similar to Avraham's. 
Proof: Let P = Col(~o, < ~l)- So P is essentially adding ~l Cohen reals. 
If Gp ~ P is (directed and ) generic over V, then Gp is also generic over L (the 
constructible universe) as P 9 L. By Theorem I. 6.7 Gp satisfies the countable 
chain condition and ~[c~] = ~= 
l~Gp] and V , V[Gp] have the same cardi- 
nals and cofinalities. Let 
Q = ~C : C a closed bounded subset of S which belong to L[Gp]] 
C 1< C 2iffC l= C 2 N(Max Ci+l ) 
Clearly Q is a forcing notion of power Sl, so it cannot collapse cardinals or 
regularity of cardinals except possibly Si- So we shall prove that P * Q does 
not 
collapse 
Si. 
So 
let 
(in 
V) 
N ~ <g(A),e>, 
g 
countable, 
(p,q) 9 
* Q9 
, (p,q) 9 
N (h~l 9 
and suppose GpcP is generic 
over V , p 9 Gp. As P satisfies the countable chain condition, p is (N,P)- 
generic, 
hence N[Gp] N V=N. 
In L[Gp] we have an enumeration 
of 
Q[Gp] N N[Gp] (of length w) (but not of the set of dense subsets ); in fact we 
have it even in L[Gpr(6+l)], 
~=NNwl. 
Now in L[Gp] there is a Cohen 
generic real over V[Gp[(6+I)] and we use it to construct C n 9 Q[Gp] in 
.L[Gp]. 
V C N[Gp] N Q[Gp] 
is 
generic 
over 
V[Gp r (6+1)]. 
So 
qt = uC n 9 Q[ Gp] is (N[ Gp],~Q[ Gp])-generic. Going to names we finish. 
w On Aronszajn trees. 
5.1 Definition: A cardinal z is said to have the tree property if every tree 
of height z in which every level has <:z members has a branch of length z. A 
tree which is a counterexample to the tree property of ~ is called a ~- 
Aronszajn tree. By the Konig infinity lemma ~ has the tree property. 

101 
A ~-Aronszajn tree in which every antichain is of cardinality < ~ is called 
a ,;-Souslin tree. An ~-Aronszajn 
tree , and an ~l-Souslin tree are called an 
Aronszajn and a Souslin tree, respectively. 
An Aronszajn tree is said to be 
special if it is the union of l~ 0 antichains. A special Aronszajn tree cannot be 
Soustin, since in a Souslin tree every antichain is countable, hence the tree, 
being uncountable, 
cannot be the union of l~ 0 antichains. 
Remark: It is easy to show that an Aronszajn tree T is special iff there is 
a function f 
: T -* ~ which is order preserving. 
5.2 Theorem= There is a special Aronszajn tree T. 
Proof: The members of the a-th level T a of T will be increasing bounded 
sequences 
of rational members with ~ as the tree relation. 
When we come to 
define T a we assume 
that 
for all fl<9'<a 
and for all 9 c T# and every 
rational 
q >Sup(x) 
there 
is 
a 
y c T 7 , x Cy 
and 
Sup(y) 
=q, 
and 
17#1 =n0. 
If 
a=O 
take 
Ta = [< >]. 
If 
a=7+l 
take 
T,.=|z^<q>:zcTv^ 
qc~^q 
>Sup(z)~, 
where 
~ 
is the 
set 
of all 
rational numbers. 
Obviously ]T a] = ] Ta] .n o = ~o. The induction hypothesis 
holds also for fl < a, as easily seen. 
If a is a limit ordinal then for every 
x ~ U T# and every q > Sup (x) we shall construct 
a sequence y of length a 
lg<a 
which extends 
x such that Sup (y) = q. 
Let ig n be an increasing sequence 
such that lg 0=ig and Sup [Bin :n <~] =a. 
Let ~qn :n <~> 
be an increas- 
ing sequence of rationals such that q0 ~- Sup x and Sup n<oqn = q" We define 
now the member x n c T~n such that Sup (xn) = q,~ as follows: x 0 = x. Assume 
x n E T#~ is defined; Sup (an) = qn < qn+l then by the induction hypothesis 
there 
is an 2,,+ 1 c Ta**l such that Sup (xn+l) = q,~+l- Take y = 
U xn, then 
the length ofy is IJign =aandSup(y) 
=Supn<oxn 
=Supn<oqn 
=q" 
Since 
we introduced 
one suchy 
for each x c 
U T# and q >Sup(x) 
and there are 
p<a 
only ~0 such pairs then t T= 1 "~ t~0- 

102 
T has no branch of length ~l since if S is such a branch then tJS is an 
increasing sequence of rationals of length ~1, which is impossible. 
By our construction of T, for every x c T 
Sup x is a rational number. 
Therefore T= 
k)~x E T:Sup(x) 
=q], 
and each set ~x c T:Sup(x)=q] 
is 
clearly an antichain. Thus the tree T is a special Aronszajn tree. 
When we want to construct a g+-Aronszajn tree we use, instead of the 
rationals, the set I1= of all finite sequences of ordinals 
<g 
considered as 
sequences 
of length eo with blank spaces identified with 0 ordered lexico- 
graphically. We can proceed as in the construction of the ~l-Aronszajn tree, 
but when we construct T a, for a limit ordinal a such that cf (a) < g, we have 
to put in T a all the increasing sequences y of members of I1= of length a such 
that y r fi c Ta for every fi < a. Otherwise we have no assurance that we can 
carry out the construction of T a for a limit ordinal a such that cf (a) = ,z. In 
order to be sure that I 7'=1 "< J;, for every a < ~+ we need that ~<~ = ~ ~ 
= ~, 
since this will enable us to prove that if for a limit ordinal a with cf (a) < r we 
construct T= as mentione~l above we still have ] T=] ,z ~. So we have proved: 
5.3 Theorem= If ~ = ~<= then there is a ir 
tree. 
If the continuum hypothesis holds then ~70 = R1 and therefore is an ~2- 
Aronszajn tree. Therefore, if we look for a model with no ~2-Aronszajn tree, 
the continuum hypothesis should fail to hold in such a model. There is a 
theorem which says that in such a model r 
is a weakly compact cardinal in 
L, hence the consistency of the inexistence of c02-Aronszajn trees is at least 
as strong as the consistency of the existence of a weakly compact cardinal; 
we shall see that these two consistency assumptions are equivalent. Mitchell 
had proved this theorem, and Baumgartner gave a simpler proof by proper 
forcing.

The following theorem is due to Baumgartner, Malitz and Reinhart [BMR]. 
5.4 Theorem: For every tree T of height ~1 with no branch of length co 1 
there is a c.c.c, forcing notion P such that in the generic extension of V by 
P 
, T is special. If I T I < 21% then by Martin's axiom it follows that T is spe- 
cial. 
As a consequence, 
if we assume Martin's axiom and 21%> l~ l, then all 
Aronszajn trees are special and hence there are no Souslin trees. 
Proof: Let P be the set of all finite functions p from T into ~ such that 
if p(z) =p(y) 
then x and y are incomparable. For every x c T the set D x of 
all members of P whose domain contains x is obviously dense in P, hence if G 
is a generic subset of P 
, F= 
UG is defined on all of T and if F(x) =F(y) 
then x and y are incomparable. If we have Martin's axiom and ] T] < 2 t~~ then 
there are 
< L :~v dense sets D= and the directed set G can be taken to inter- 
sect all of them, 
and F= U G is as above, i.e., it specializes 
T since 
T= U~= :r(x) =n~. 
n 
We still have to prove that P satisfies the c.c.e. 
Suppose there is an 
uncountable 
subset 
If of P 
whose members 
are pairwise incompatible. 
Without loss of generality we can assume that all members of If have the 
same cardinality, that their domains form a A-system with the same kernel s 
and that for all/) e If , p ts is the same function. Denote W= |Pa:a 
<r 
and let Dom (Pa-s) 
= ~xa, 1 ..... 
x=,•]. 
Let a,fl < ~1, Pa and pp are incom- 
patible, hence Pa U Pp t~ P. Since Pa and p~ coincide on s and the rest of 
their 
domains 
are 
disjoint 
we 
must 
have 
for 
some 
1 <- k,~ ~n, 
pa(Xa]r 
= pH(xpl) 
while 
Xa, ~ 
and 
zp,~. 
are 
comparable. 
Let 
Ya,k.s = ~fl < r 
: ~ # a, pa(Za,k) =p~(xp.lZ ) and Xa, ~ and xfl,~ are comparable 
l. As we saw 
U 
Y~.~,~ = ~1 - |a]. 
Let E be a uniform ultrafilter on ~1, 
l<k ,s 
then for every a there are k and s such that Ya,~,~ e E, let/c (a) and ~ (a) be 
such. Therefore for an uncountable subset A of r 
, k(a) =/c and ~(a) = s

than both xak " and x~, e and since T is a tree, xak " is comparable with xp,~. 
This holds for all a,jff 9 A hence T has a linearly ordered subset of cardinality 
~1 and therefore a branch of length ~1, contradicting our assumption. 
w 
Maybe there is no t~2-Aronszajn tree. 
6.1 Lerama: Assume V [= "~~ > Sl ^ T is an c02-Aronszajn tree." Let P be 
an ~l-complete 
poser. 
Then V[P] ~ T has no cofinal branches. 
(co 2 may 
become of cardinality co I in V[P] so it does not have to stay an ~2-Aronszajn 
tree.) 
Proof: Assume that P0 []-"' E is a cofinal branch in T': We shall define 
in V two f~anctions F : 2 <~ -* T t a for some a < ~2 and S : 2 <~ -. P such that: 
(i) F(<>)= 
the root of T,S(<>) 
=Po 
(ii) for allx e2 <~ S(x) [~"F(x) eE'" 
(iii) x .6, y --. S(x) <p S(y), F(z) < F(y), and 
(iv) F(x ^ <0>) and F(z ^ <l>) are incomparable in T. 
F(x) 
and 
S(z) 
are 
defined 
by induction 
on 
the 
length 
of x. 
Since 
S(z) ~PPo , S(z) 
has, for every fl < ~2, an extension 
which puts some 
member 
of Tp (i.e., the set of vertices of height fl in the tree) in B. 
If 
If > F(x) : (~p >-p S(z))p I~-" t e E"] were 
a 
set 
of pairwise 
comparable 
members 
of T then they would be a branch 
of T in V, contradicting 
our 
hypothesis. 
Therefore there are two incomparable f's in this set, take one to 

105 
be F(z ^ <0>) and the other to be F(z 
^ <1>) and choose S(x 
^ <0>) and 
S(x 
^ <1>) as conditions -> S(x) 
such that S(x ^ <i>) II-"'F(x ^ <i>) 9 E" 
for i 9 lo,ll. Since the range of F is countable it is included in some T t a for 
some a < ~2- Since P is ~1 -complete, for every ~ 9 2 ~ , P contains a condi- 
tion pn which is an upper bound of [S(17 t n) : n 9 ~. Since pn ->P0 there is a 
q,1-~P.landat n9 Tasuchthatq.1 ][-"tn9 
Letv #77, ~,~7 9 
Letn be 
the least such that u r 7% ~ ~7 ~ n, then by requirement (iv) above we have that 
F(y ~ ~%) and F(~ 7 r n) are incomparable in T. q,1 ~P,I -> S(~7 F n), hence also 
q. I[-"F(~7 try)9 E': Since q. forces that E is a branch of T and that 
t.,F(~7 t~%) 9 ~clearly 
t.1 and F(~7 t r~) are comparable in T. Since the height 
of F(r Itn) 
is <a and the height of t,1 is a we have t,~>2"(7/~%). 
Similarly 
also T~ > F(v t n), and since F(~7 t n) and F(u t n) are incomparable also t,~ 
and t~ are incomparable and hence different. 
Thus T a contains 2 hI" >R1 
different members tn' contradicting the assumption that T is an ~2-Aronszajn 
tree. 
6.2 Theorem= If ZFC is consistent with the existence of a weakly com- 
pact cardinal then ZFC is consistent with 2~~ ~2 and the non-existence of 
c02-Aronszajn trees. 
Remark: By what was mentioned last section we have "iff" in this 
theorem. 
Mitchell had proved the theorem and Baumgartner 
thai gave a 
simpler proof by proper forcing. 
Proof: Let g be a weakly compact cardinal. We shall use a system 
< Q : i < ~> of iterated forcing with countable support. Q~ will be the compo- 
sition of two forcing notions Q~,0 and Q~,I . Now 
Q~,0 will be the poser of countable functions on ~1 into c02 (in V[Pi]) which 
collapses ~o 2. Q~,0 is obviously ~l-complete. 
V[Pt][Q~,o] contains wl-trees of 
cardinality 
~ 
with 
no 
cofinal 
branch 
(e.g., 
I<a,~> :fl<a<c011 
with 
<a,~> <T<at•> 
iffa=a 
t^~<fit). 
Let W be the disjoint union of all such 
trees, as a single tree with at most 2 ~t roots ( we take all the trees to be 

106 
~ 
x li{ with some partial orderings). By Theorem 5.4 there is a c.c.c, forcing 
Q~,~ which makes this tree special, and hence makes every ~- tree of cardi- 
nality t~l special, provided it has no ~vbranch. 
Let us notice 
that 
these 
descriptions 
of Q~.0 in 
V[P~] and 
Q~,I in 
V[P~][Q~,o] = V[Pi * Q~.0] really yield corresponding names Q 
and Q 
by the 
~.0 
~i. I 
Lemma of the existential completeness which we proved. 
Since Q~,0 is mvcomplete over V[P~] and since Qi,1 satisfies the c.c.c, over 
V[P~][Q~,o] both are proper, hence 
Q~,0 * Q~,I is proper and therefore 
also 
each P~ , i < g, is proper. 
Thus ml is not collapsed even in V[P~]. Let ~ be 
an inacessible cardinal ~ <- g. Our construction of Pi and Q~ are such that for 
i <Awe have IQ~I <~, 
hence each Q~ hascardinality 
<~. Therefore, as we 
proved, also P~ satisfies the h-c.c, and therefore ~ is not collapsed in V[P~] 
and thus V[Px] ~ "h =* Oz" (since e~ 1 too is not collapsed). 
6.3 Lemma: V[Ph] ~ " there are at least )~ real numbers 
" for every 
Proof: It suffices to prove that 
for every i < ~ there 
is a real in 
V[P~+I]- V[P~][Qi,0]. We shall see that a forcing notion such as Q~,I intro- 
duces a Cohen real over the previous universe. 
Let us simplify the notation 
by writing V t for V[P~][Q~,o] , Q for Q~,I and T for the tree in V t which Q 
makes special. 
Let (aj: 
j < ~0) be an ascending sequence in T in V t (i.e., 
j <k <~-,aj 
<ra*). 
Q introduces a function F on T into ~ such that if 
a,b 9 TandF(a) =F(b) thena 
andb 
are incomparable. 
Forj

i =0 
ifF(aj) is even and tj = 1 ifF(ai) isodd. We shall see that t =(tj

a Cohen real over V t, i.e., for every dense subset~)

6.4 Lemma: For every inaccessible A < r

a

which is a contradiction. 
Continuation of the Proof of Theorem 6.2: Now let us go on with the 
proof of the theorem. Assume that there is a P0 e P~ such that P0 ]~-p~ " 
there is an o~2-Aronszajn tree," i.e., P0 l~-P." there is a/c-Aronszajn tree T on r 
and a function r on g such that for a <r , F(a) is the rank of {xin T, (since 
by the lemma FIPz] [= "~2 = ~'9, i.e., P0 [~-P." there is a transitive relation T 
on r such that for all a,~, 7 6 r if aT 7 and ~T 7 then a = ~ v aT~ A ~Ta and 
there is a function F on ~ into r such that for all a,j~ 6 ~ if a Tfl then 
F(a) < Y(~), for all a e m and 7 < F(a) there is a ~Ta such that F(~) = T, and 

108 
for all 7 e:_ g there is a fle g such that for all a e ,: if F(a) 
='7 then a -- fl, and 
for all B C g there are a,fl e B such that a ~ fl ^ - aTfl ^ - flTa, or else there 
is a fl < ~ such that B C fl". This implies, by the existential completeness 
that 
there are canonical names of T and F of relations on ~ such that:

name B of a subset 
and for every standard

We have to use a different formal 
representation 
for the names 
LIT, so that 
for a limit ordinal 
~ > p(p) 
if UT i is a canonical 
name 
of a subset 
of ~ or 
4,e[ 
x ~ then 
U% 
E R(A) 
. This follows from 
Theorem 
I. 5.6. and 
from 
the fact 
that ~ is large enough. 
Consider now the structure < H(~),c,,, T,E> 
(*) is a 
first order 
statement 
about 
this structure, 
and 
that (**) holds for every B as 
mentioned 
is a II~ statement 
about 
this structure. 
Since ~ is weakly 
compact 
and 
therefore 
II~ indescribable 
there 
is an inaccessible 
cardinal 
A < ~ such 
that <H(A),C,A,TC~ A x A,F~ (~ A x A> 
is an elementary substructure of 
<H(m),e,m,T,~. 
Pz and [[-z are definable in <H(m),e,~,T,~ and the same 
definitions give PA and ]~-A in <H(A),6,A,~ ('] A x A,E A A x A>. Therefore 
(T N A x A)[GA] is a A-Aronszajn tree in V[GA] (where G is the generic subset 
of Pz over Vand G A= G /'~PA). We claim that (TNAxA)[GA] 
is the part of 
N 
the tree T[G] up to levelA. Let<a,fl> 6 (T(~Ax)~)[GA] then a,~< Aand for 
some p 6 G A, p IFpa<U,~> 6(T ('~ AxA), hence p ]~-p "<a,~/> 6T" (by 
the relation between the two above mentioned structures), hence, since 

109 
p c G , <a,fl> e T[G], shows that (T n Nx X)[Gx] is included in the part of 
7[G] up to level ~. The proof of the equality of these two trees will be com- 
pletes once we show that in ~G] all the ordinals in the levels below ~ are <X. 
Let /~ < k then, since (*) holds for the structure 
<H(~),... 
> 
there is a 
p c G x 
and 
an 
ordinal 
fi < ~ 
such 
that 
p 
[~-v~(Va E X) 
(FNXxX)(a)=/~a<fl), 
thereforep 
I~p,,(Vae~) (F(a) =/~-,a<fl), 
and 
since p C G we have in V[G] that all the ordinals in the level ~ are < fl < k. 
Thus in V[Px] 
T N (/~ • •) 
is a ~-Aronszajn tree, i.e., an o2-Aronszajn 
N 
tree. 
As we saw in V[Px] there are at least ~ real numbers, i.e., 2 I% ~ l~ a in 
V[Px]- 
Qx,0 is an col-complete poser in V[Px], therefore, 
by lemma 6.1 
T N ~" x ~ 
still 
has 
no 
cofinal 
branch 
in 
V[Px][Qx,0]. 
Since 
in 
V[Px][Qx,o] , [~,[ =l~ 1 there is a subset a of X of order-type ~i. Let b be the 
set of all the ordinals in T N k • X whose level is in a, T N b x b is an eostree 
with no cofinal branch in V[Px][Qx,o]. Qx.1 makes this tree special. 
Thus 
T N (b x b) is a special Col-tree in V[Px+I] and therefore it stays so also in 
V[Px] since the function which makes it special is in V[Px+I] and hence also 
in V[P,]. Thus in V[P,] T C~ (b x b) has no cofinal branch and therefore 
T N (k x ~) too has no cofinal branch, 
but this is a contradiction 
since 
T N (~ x k) is the part up to level k of the ~-tree T and as such it must have 
branches of length X. 
We used a weakly compact ~ to obtain a generic extension in which there 
are no r 
trees. If all we want is to obtain an extension of V in 
which there are no special w2-Aronszajn trees ( i.e., trees which are the union 
of R i antichains ) then it suffices to use a Mahlo cardinal ~. 
w Closed unbounded subsets of c01 can run away from many sets. 

110 
Baumgartner [B3] has proved the consistency of the following with 
ZFC + 2~~ 
if A~ ~1 
is infinite 
countable 
then 
there 
is a closed 
unbounded C C ~1 such that A~ ~' C for every i < ~1. 
We prove a somewhat stronger assertion. 
7.1 Theorem= ZFC + 2 ~~ = ~2 is consistent with: 
(*) if A~ c ~1 has no last element and is non-empty and has order type 
< Sup A~, for i < ~1, then there is a closed unbounded sub- 
set C of ~1, such that C C~ A~ is bounded in A~ for every i. 
Remark: Lately Avraham improved Baumgartner's result to ZFC + '2 ~~ = 
anything + 
(**) there are B2 closed unbounded subsets of ~1, the intersection of 
any t~ 1 of them is finite. 
Galvin proved previously that CH implies (*) fail. 
Our proof is similar to 
[Sh80] w 
Proof: We start with a model V satisfying CH, and use CS iterated forc- 
ing of length I~ 2, such that in the intermediate stages CH still holds. So by 
4.1., it suffices to prove. 
7.2 Lemma: Suppose V satisfies CH. There is a proper forcing notion of 
power ~1 
which 
adds 
a 
closed 
unbounded 
subset 
of 
C 
of 
~1 
and 
Sup [C ~ A] < Sup A for any infinite A C ~1 with no last element and order 
type < Sup A, which belongs to V. 
Discussion: A plausible forcing to exemplify 7.2 is: 
Q = | C : C a closed countable subset of ~1 so that if 
A E V , ~=SupA 
limit, A has order type<~, 
then Sup [A C~ C] < ~1 
with the order C 1 < C 2 iff C 2 N [(Max C1) + 1] = C 1. 

111 
So the elements 
of Q are approximations 
to the required 
C. It is clear 
that a generic subset of Q gives a C as required, provided that ~z is not col- 
lapsed; hence the main point is to prove the properness 
of Q. Unfortunately 
it seemed Q is not proper. 
However if we want to add a C c Q which is (N,Q)- 
generic for some N < ~H(X),c) 
a c.c.c, forcing is enough. So we could first 
force with some P, IPI =1~2 , P satisfies the c.c.c, 
such that 
[I-p "2~~ =1~2 
and MA holds " Then we define Q in V[G] for G ~ P generic over V; similar to 
the definition above, 
Q = IC c V[G]: C a closed countable subset of co 1, and if A c V is infinite 
with 
no 
last 
element 
and 
(order 
type 
A) < Sup A < Max C, 
then 
Sup (C Fl A) < Sup A] 
Now Q is proper, and add a C as required, so P * Q add a C as required. 
N 
Unfortunately 
P * Q also collapses I~ 2, so if we are willing to use some strongly 
inaccessible g > I~ 0, there is no problem. Otherwise, we use a restricted 
ver- 
sion of MA , which is consistent 
with 2 I% =l~ 1, so 7.3, 7.4, 7.5 below prove 
Lemma 7.2 hence Theorem 7.1.

IV. On oracle-c.c, and "p(c0) / finite has no non-trivial automorphism 
Abstract: Here we present how to iterate forcing satisfying the M-c.c. 
for an oracle M. This enables us, in some sense, to "construct" the set of 
reals in co~. steps with omitting types along the way (i.e., imitating construc- 
tions of model theory). We use it to prove the consistency of "D(c0)/finite has 
no non-trivial automorphism", which is equivalent to " I~(N)- N has only 
trivial homeomorphisms". 
w 
Introduction. 
It is well known that if CH holds then f)(c0)/finite is a saturated (model- 
theoretically) atomless Boolean algebra of power I~ i, hence has many auto- 
morphisms, as any isomorphism from one countably subalgebra to another, 
can be extended to an automorphism. It was not clear what the situation is if 
CH fails. 
On the other hand any one-to-one function f from one co-finite subset of 
c0 to another co-finite subset of c0, induces an automorphism of ~(c0) / finite : 
A/finite is mapped to f (A) /finite. We call such an automorphism trivial. A 
priori it is not clear whether f)(c0)/finite has non-trivial automorphisms.. Our 
main conclusion is that not necessarily must there be any non-trivial auto- 
morphism. 
Our main tool is "oracle chain condition forcing". Iterating forcing satis- 
fying the ill-chain condition, introduced by Solovay and Tennenbaum is well 
known. We use much of the same framework: we start, e.g., with the construc- 
tible universe V = L, and use (finite support) iteration of length ca 2 of forcing 
notions, <P~,Q.:i < c0~>, each Qi satisfying the t~;-c.c, and of power t~ 1. At 
N$ 
stage a we guess an automorphism fa of p(c0) in V P', more exactly a P=-name 

115 
of such an automorphism such that for any P~-name f of an automorphism 
of p(~)/finite for stationarily many a < oa, we have: cf a = ~1, and f 
c f 
(this is possible if we have a diamond sequence on 16 < ~2:cf (~) = otJ, by 
some simple considerations). 
Our means of killing the automorphism, i.e., 
guaranteeing f= cannot be extended to an automorphism of p(~)/finite in 
V P', is to add a set X ~ ~ so that for no Y~: 
(*) X C~ A is finite <=> Y N fa(A) is finite 
for every A e -'^ 
-[/2(~)]IF~ The 
Pm 
demand (*) helps us since if f D f= is an automorphism of [/9(~)] v 8/finite 
then Y/finite = f (X/ finite ) satisfies (*). 
This looks very reasonable, but even if we succeed to show that when we 
add X (by the forcing Q=) we do not add a Y satisfying (*), how can we know 
that such a Y is not added later on in the iteration? 
This is the role of the oracle chain condition. 
The best way we can 
explain the construction is as follows. We can look at iterated forcing as a 
construction of the continuum in ~2 steps, i.e., at each successor step we add 
more reals, and even at limit steps of cofinality ~ we do so (but not at limit 
steps of cofinality ~1). Now promising not to add a Y as in (*) is an omitting 
type obligation, and building a model of power S2 by a chain of ~2 approxima- 
tions, promising to omit types along the way, is a widely used method in model 
theory ( mainly for St instead of ~). See e.g., Keisler's work on L(Q), for ~1; 
the H 2 case like ours is somewhat more difficult, see [Sh 80c ]. 
The oracle chain condition itself is in a sense an effective version of the 
H1-c,c. One of the usual ways to construct an ~i-c.c. forcing P of power t~ I is 
to make its set of elements be ~I; let M = <M8:6 < r~1> (the COl -oracle ) be a 
sequence of countable sets which is a diamond sequence ( i.e., such that for 
every A c COl, Ir : A f~ ~ e Mr is stationary) and demand: 
if A 6 M~ is predense in P t ~ then it is predense in P. 

116 
We call (a variant of) this the M -c.c. , (assuming each ~/8 is closed 
enough). 
The connection between it and the omitting type argument dis- 
cussed above is the following. 
Suppose B~ are Borel sets of reals (i < 111) such that their intersection is 
even if we add a Cohen real. Then (if a Q, - sequence exists at all ) 
empty 
1 
there is an ~I- oracle M such that in any generic extension of V by a forcing 
satisfying the M-chain condition no real is in all the B~'s (note that in a 
bigger universe we reinterpret each H~ using the same definition). 
Clearly in order to apply oracle chain condition forcings we have to prove 
relevant lemmas on composition, preservation by direct limit, and it is very 
helpful to make 111 conditions on satisfying the oracle chain condition into 
one. For this we have to choose the right variant of the definition. The net 
result is that at step a we are given an c01-oraele which Qa has to satisfy, and 
are allowed to demand, for 1t 1 Borel types, that I~'~ will omit them provided 
that not only our universe V P" omits them, but even forcing by Cohen forcing 
does not change this. 
This is done in w 
and has little to do with 
~co)/finite. 
After all this we still have to do the induction step, i.e., working in V Pa and 
being given an automorphism f=, and an c01-oracle M we have to find Q , 
adding a real X, and satisfying the M-c.c., so that (*) holds for no Yeven if we 
N 
add a Cohen real. 
Of course if fa is trivial this cannot be done. 
We shall construct Oa, 
assume there is a name Y (for Q=- x Cohen) forced to satisfy (*), and analys- 
ing this we shall at last prove/= is trivial. We have to note that if / is a P~,- 
name of a non-trivial automorphism of p(c0)/finite, 
then for a closed 
unbounded Ccc02, for every 5c C with cf (6) =c01, fr[p(~0)] Cs has a P6- 
name forced (for P~) to be a non-trivial automorphism of p(c0)/finite, hence 

117 
the diamond on 16 < ~2:cf (6)= c011 guessed it stationarily often, hence we 
have "killed" it somewhere in the process. 
A natural question is: 
Question: Find a parallel of M-c.c., replacing Cohen forcing (in the 
assumptions of the omitting type theorem) by random real forcing, or any 
other reasonable forcing addding a real. 
Note that if P ~ Q then P <o Q iff every predense subset of P is predense 
in Q (to see that this is a necessary condition, assume J ~ P is predense; let 
~~ = iP e P : (3q c ~)p > q I and let ~q~176 
be a maximal set of pairwise incom- 
patible conditions contained in J'; 
then J'~ is a maximal antichain of P, 
hence of Q, therefore it is predense in Q and so is .9). 
w i On oracle chain conditions 
1.1. Definition= An ~1- oracle is a sequence ~ = (M~ : 6 a limit ordinal 
<: ~1>, where M~ is a countable transitive model of ZFC- (or a large enough 
portion of ZFC ) such that 6 ~ Ms, M~ ~ "5 is countable " and ~ satisfies: (V 
A C e01)[16:A N 6 E M~ is stationary ]. 
(ZFC - is ZFC without the power set axiom). 
Remark: Note that the existence of an r 
is equivalent to the 
holding of ~ 
(by a theorem of Kunen), and that ~ 
implies CH. 
1 
1 
In order that the reader can see how we intend to associate a condition 
on forcing notions with each ~z-oracle M, we give here a tentative definition 
(which we will.modify later): 
1.2 First try: A forcing P with universe ~1 satisfies the M-c.c. if 
(V6)(VA c M~) [A C 6 ^ A is predense in P r 6 -* A is predense in P]. 

118 
But by this it is possible that P, P? are isomorphic; one satisfies this and 
one doesn't. The solution will be to require the property not for all 6, but 
only for a large enough set of 6's: 
1.3 Definition: With each oracle M we associate a filter D~ over col gen- 
erated by the sets I~I(A ) = [6 < col : A (~ 6 9 M~{ for every A C: COl" Let p(6) be 
~A "A C 6i. 
1.4 Claim: i) If < M~ ~ p(6):6 < col> is a O "-sequence then every gen- 
erator of Dj/, I~(A), contains a closed unbounded set; 
2) 
For 
every 
A,B c col 
there 
is 
C C col 
such 
that 
I~(C) = I~(A) N I~(B). 
3) 
D~ is a proper 
normal filter, 
containing 
every closed 
unbounded set of limit ordinals < c0 i. 
Remark: Recall that ~Sa: 6 < col> is a O "-sequence if IS~I ---S0 and 
for every A C ca I, 16 : A (~ 6 9 S~I contains a closed unbounded subset of r 
and if V = L then a 0 "-sequence exists. 
Proof: i) By the definitions of a O *-sequence and of I~(A). 
2) Let g:(o 1 -* col be the mapping defined by g(a) = 2a, and let 
f:col-'col be the mapping defined byf(a) 
=2a§ 
1. If 6<co 1 is a limit ordi- 
nal, then 6 is closed under g,f, and g r 6, f t 6 e M$. 
Now, taking C = g (A) (J f (B) we obtain what we need (remembering M~ is 
a model of ZFC-). 
3) a) DZ1 contains every closed unbounded set of limit ordinals 
< cop 
For this, we have to construct, for given M and increasing continuous 
sequence <6~ :i <col>, a subset A of col such that if 6<col, & #6~ for all 
< (a l, then A N 6 ~( Ma. We construct such A piece by piece, namely deter- 
mining A N[6~,6~ +co) by induction on i ( we begin with i =-1 
taking 

119 
~-l = 0; outside these intervals all ordinals are in A). Having determined 
A ~ 6i, we have 2 ~~ possibilities for A /'] (~ + c0); we choose one which does 
not belong to the countable set IS (h (~r 
c M~, ~r < 6 < ~r 
It is easy to check that A satisfies our requirement. 
b) D~ is a proper fllter. 
By 2) every set in D~/ contains some IF(A ) which is stationary, hence 
nonempty. 
c) D~I is normal. 
It suffices to show that if Ar 
r 
< ~1) then there is A ~ ~1 such that 
A N6 ~M~ implies A~ (h~EM~ for alli<~. 
By a) and 2) it suffices if the 
implication holds for closed unboundedly many ~'s. 
Let <-,-> 
be a 
nicely defined pairing function from ordinals to 
ordinals, (preserving countability) 
, and let C = 16 < ~1:~ is closed under 
<-,-> and the respective projections J. For ~ E C, the restrictions of <--,-> 
and the respective projections to 6 belong to M 8. C is closed unbounded in 
~1" 
LetA = |<i,a>:aEA~],assume~E 
C andA (] ~cM S , and leti <~. Then 
also Ar N ~ c Ms, which completes the proof. 
1.5 Definition (real one): A forcing notion P satisfies the M-c,c.: 
a) If IPI ":~o- 
b) If ]P] =81 and for some (every) f:P-,a~ 1 which is one-to-one, 
16 < wl : A c M6,A C ~, f-l(A) 
is predense 
in f-1(6) 
implies f-l(A) 
is 
predense in P| c D B. (the equivalence of the "some" and "every" versions is 
seen to be true by considering I~(B), where B C wl codes a partial one-to-one 
function from ~1 into e~ 1 induced by two representations f ,g of P). 
c) If IPI >81 and for every ptcp 
if ]P?I -<81 then there are P" ~Pt 
(P" ~ P) and f :P" -, ~1, as in b). 

120 
Remark: In any case, usually we use iterations of length r 
starting with 
V = L, so we work explicitly only with ] P ] = ~ l- 
1.6 Claimc 1) If P satisfies the M-c.c. for some r 
~ then P 
satisfies the ~l-c.c. 
2) Let M be an r 
P <o Q. If Q satisfies the M-c.c. then P 
satisfies the M-c.c. 
3) In Definition 1.5 for IP] >~1 we can demand P" <o P and get 
an equivalent definition. 
Proof: 1) Clearly, it suffices to prove it for P with universe r 1. So, 
assume that ~ is a maximal antichain in P of power Sl. Then there is a closed 
unbounded subset C of ~1 such that: if 6 e C, q < & then there is p e ~ C~ 
compatible with q, and also if p ,q < ~ are compatible then they have a com- 
mon upper bound in P t &. 
As P 
satisfies the _~-c.c., there is ~ e C V~ I~(o~ with the property: 
[A e M 6, A is a predense subset of P t ~] --> A is predense in P (actually, the 
set of these ~'s is in D~). But ~ N ~ is a counterexample, as any p e ~ - ~ is 
incompatible with every q e ~ C~ ~- 
8) Assume first that IP I = ]Q] =s 1. W.l.o.g. the universe of Q is 
r 
We have to show that for a set inD~ of ~'s, if A is predenseinPt~and 
A e Ms then A is predense in P. Since Q satisfies the M-c.c., it suffices to 
show that A is predense in Q t ~. 
For q c Q define 
~)q = |r c P:v is incompatible with q, or (u 
~ r)(rt c P -+ rt is compatible 
with q)]. 
Let ~q be a maximal set of pairwise incompatible elements in ~q. 
As ~)r 
is dense in P, ~q is a maximal antichain in P, hence in Q (since P <o Q). Pick 
rq e~ fiq such that (Yrt ~ rq)(rt c P -~ r t is compatible with q); such rq exists 
since otherwise q would contradict the fact that fiq is a maximal antichain in 
Q. We may assume that 6 is such that q < ~ implies rq < 6, anypl@2 c P t 6 

121 
compatible in P are compatible in P r 6, and similarly for Q. 
Now, let A be predense in P r 6 and let q c Q r 6. Since rq c P r 6, there is 
lo E A compatible with rq. Let rt E P be above p, rq. By the choice of rq, vt is 
compatible with q, hence p is compatible with q, so we finished. 
Before proving the claim for all P,Q we establish the following simple fact 
on forcing notions: 
1.6A Fact: (CH). If Pi C P2, IP1] --t~l, and P2 satisfies the tti-c.c., then 
there is P3 such that ] P3 ] < t~ 1 and P1 C P3 <~ P2- 
Proof of Fact: We define by induction a sequence <P(a):a < cot> as fol- 
lows: 
p(0) = Pi. 
p(a) = U P(P) for limit a. 
te<a 
For a = g + 1, for every countable subset ~9 of P(#) which is not predense 
in P2, pick P3 c P2 exemplifying this. Let P~=) be the set obtained by adding 
the pjs to P(#) . Let p(a) be the set obtained from p~=) by adding a common 
upper bound for every pair in p~a) having one in P2- 
Now, Pa = 
U P(=) is as required, proving the Fact. 
a,C~ i 
Returning to our claim, we distinguish the following cases: 
(i) ] P I --< bt0. Then trivially P satisfies the/~-c.c. 
(ii) IP] =t~l. Then there is pt, p ~ pt such that pt satisfies the M-c.c. 
and ]pt] =t~ 1 (this follows from the definition of Q satisfying the M-c.c.). 
Since P <o Q, P <o pt and now by what we have proved P satisfies the M-c.c. 
(iii) IPI >t~l. Let pt c P, ]Pt I -<~l. Using the Fact, we obtain P", such 
that IF" [ ~ ttl and pt ~ p" <o p. Since P <o Q it follows that P" <o Q, so by (i), 

122 
(ii) P" satisfies the M-c.c. Hence P satisfies the M-c.c. 
3) Let P satisfy the M-c.c. (by Definition 1.5), IP] > 141' and let 
pt c p, IP?I ~1 
and choose P", 
]P"I ~81 such that P? c P'~ <~ P. From 2) 
we know that P" satisfies the M-c.c., hence is as required. 
w The omitting type theoremu 
2.1 Lemma: (~). 
Suppose ~bi(x)(i < c01) are II 1 (i.e., V real 3 real ... ) 
formulas on reals (with a real parameter, possibly). Suppose further that 
there is,no solution to ./~ @~(x) in V; and moreover even if we add a Cohen to 
"b qE~a) I 
V real there will be none. Then there is an ~1 -oracle M such that P ~ M-c.c. 
implies in V P there is no solution to/~. Ip~ (x). 
Proof: Let n < ~ be large enough so that the forcing theorems can be 
proved from ~,,~ sentences in ZFC , and the assumption of the lemma can be 
formulated as a ~,,,~ statement. 
Now, for a given countable forcing notion P and a given P-name for a 
real ~, let M(P,~) be a countable ~-elementary 
submodel of V containing P, 
and ~@~: i < ~1~. Let D(P,~) be the collection of all predense subsets of 
P lying in/g(P,T). 
2.1A Clain~ If P c p? and every A c D(P,T) is predense in P?, then 
V/n ~ ~ A 
~(r) (note that ~ is also a PLname). 
Proof of Claim: Let G be PLgeneric over V. Since every A C ~}(P,T) is 
predense in pt and therefore intersects G, G y~ P is P-generic over M(P,'r). 
Also ~[G] = T[G C~ P]- Since M(P,~) is a ~n-elementary submodel of V, it 
satisfies the assumption of the lemma, hence M(P,~)[G ~ P] ]= ~ Ipi(~[G]) 

123 
.U(P,.~)

generic subset of it is equivalent to adding a Cohen real). Since ~@ state-

to

follows 
that 
V[ G] ~ ~ "tl,~(T), proving the claim. 
Now, using 
% 
and a closing process, we can obtain an r 
1 
= <M~: ~ < ~1> satisfying: if P has universe 6 < ~1 and P,[ 9 M~ then 
~(P,T) c M a (remember that P,D(P,T) are countable). We will show that 
satisfies the requirement of the lemma. 
Assume, on the contrary, that pt ~ M-c.c. but T is a Pt-name of a real so 
N 
that V/~ ~/~ ~bg(~). We may assume that IPt I =Sl since: 
a) if I pt I --< S0 then this is impossible by the assumption of the lemma. 
b) if IPt I >Sl then by !.6(1) and 1.6(3) we can find P" such that T is a 
P"-name, ]P"] =I~1, P" <opt and P" ~M-c.c. Since P" <opt V P" ~ -~(~) 
would imply V/n ~ - ~i(T), hence V P" ~ r 
). So P" can replace pt in the 
sequel. 
W.l.o.g. the universe of pt is ~t- We can find 6 < ~1 such that letting 
P = Pt F 6 the following will hold: 
(i) T is a P-name. 
(ii) P,T e M~. 
(iii) P c P t. 
(iv) A e M,~, A is a predense subset of P ------> A is predense in pt.

From these facts , the claim and the construction of M, it follows that

3.1 Claim: If ~/i-(i < Wl) are Wl-oracles then there is an ~l-oraele M such 
that:

Since for A c ~1, every sufficiently large ~ 9 I~?~(A) is in I~?,(A), it suffices 
to show that if 6 has the required property with respect to M 2 (and ~ is 
sufficiently large) then it has the required property with respect to Mz. But 
this follows trivially from M~ c M~. 
8.2 C]a!m: If P~(i < a) is the result of finite support iteration, each P~ 
satisfying the J~-c.c., P = t3 P~, fhen P satisfies the M-c.c. 
Proof: We demand superficially less on the Pi's: P~ <o pj for i < j , and 
Pa = (3 Pi for limit 6 < a, and each Pi (for i < et) satisfies the M-c.c.c. 
(<~ 
Case I: a successor. 
Clearly P 9 [P~:i < a] (it is P~-x) so by assumption P satisfies the M-e.c.

As Pi cP

Case m: af (a) = c01. 
Obviously it is sufficient to deal with the case a = ~1- We will now show 

126 
that it is sufficient to deal with the case IPI = t~. 
Indeed, if IPI <~1 then the conclusion of our claim holds. So assume 
IPI >~I, and P does not satisfy the M-c.c. Then there is Pt C P of power t~ 1 
so that P? C P" C P, I P~ ] =t~ 1 imply that P" does not satisfy the M-c.c. We 
note that P satisfies the t~Vc.c. (See Claim 1.6(1) and Lemma II 2.8). We now 
refer the reader to the proof of Fact 1.6A (in the proof of Claim 1.6(2)). We 
repeat here, for pt ~ p , the same construction, with the additional provision 
that pi is always chosen to belong to a P~ with the least possible i (and the 
same is done when adding common upper bounds). The effect of this is that 
we obtain P" (P3 in the notation used there) so that not only P" <o P but also 
P" f~Pi <~Pi for every i <r 
Hence for each i <r~ 1 P" AP* satisfies the 
M-c.c. Also, as P" f3 P~ <" P" (h P~+I (since P" (3 P~ <~ P~ <~ P) and for limit 
P" fhP~=

NP~), 
it follows that <P" (hP~ :i <~> 
satisfies 
our

hypothesis . But ]P"I =t~l and it does not satisfy the /~-c.c., so we have 
reduced our counterexample to one of power t~. 
We assume now, w.l.o.g., that Pi - CJPj C r

a predense subset of Pir (6 x 6) implies C is predense in P~{. 
For each i <c01, Ar eddy. We let pri be a function from Px~

We 
let

For each i < ~1 , B~ c D~.

since ~9 
Therefore , as 69 
pr~(Cx~) 
ispredenseinPc. 
Using (*) again, (as P$ = U P~ , P r (~ x 6) c P~) C is predense in P$, and since 
P8 <~ P, C is predense in P. Thus we have proved that P satisfies the M-c.c. 
Case IV: cf (a) = t~. 
One can deal with this case as with Case III (the diagonal intersections are 
replaced by countable intersections). 
We shall deal now with the "real" successor case: 
8.3 Clnira: Assume V ~ ~ 
M is an ~l-oracle, P is a forcing notion of 
f 
power ~1 satisfying the M-c.c. Then in V P there is an c01-oracle M ~ such that: 
if Q 9 V P satisfies the M~ 
(in V P) then P * Q (which is in V) satisfies the 
M-c.c. 
Proof: First we observe that if M~ in V P is good for all Q of power ~ B1 
then it is good for all Q. Hence we shall treat Q as a P-name of a binary rela- 
tion on co z (but we shall define M* without depending on a given Q). We also 
assume that P has universe ~1, and we fix for the rest of the proof a generic 
G ~ P (which has a canonical P-name in I/). 
For A ~ wl x wl define A c = [a:(~p 9 G)(p,a) 9 AJ. 
Let ~ < co l be a limit ordinal . We let M; be a countable transitive model 
of ZFC - containing 6, M 6 and ~A a " A c ~ x ~,A 9 M,~J. We will first show that 
M" is a ~-sequence 
in V[G]. 
So we are given a P-name S of a subset of ~1, and we have to show that 
N 
[~:S[G] N ~ 9 M~] is stationary in V[G]. Since P satisfies the ~l-C.C., every 
closed unbounded subset of wl in V[G] contains one in V, so it suffices to 

128 
show that if C c V is a closed unbounded subset of ~1 then there is 5 a C 
such that S[G] N ~ 9 M~. 
Let, for each a < ~l,.ga ~ P be a maximal antichain of conditions deciding 
the truth value of a c S. 
As P satisfies the t~l-c.c., each ,9 a is countable, so 
w.l.o.g, for all ~ 9 C, a < 5 implies ~ga C 5, and P t 5 ~ P, (so if p,q 9 P t 5 have 
a common upper bound in P, they have one in P t 5.) 
Now, let T = I(p,a):p ][-p "a 9 S"] . As M is an ~l-oracle, there are 5 c C 
N 
and A EM$ such that A = T f~(hxh). 
By our construction of M~ A a9 
We will show that S[ G ] N 5 = A g. 
Assume 
first 
that 
a9 
Nh. 
Let p 9 G N~ga, 
then 
10 <5 
and 
p ]]-p"aeS", 
hence aeA a. 
Assume now that aeA g. 
Then for some 
N 
p 9 G,p I[-p"a9 
and a<6, 
hence a9 
f~5. Thus IS[G] Nh=A 
~ , 
and we have proved that M" is an ~t-oracle in V[G]. 
We 
now 
assume 
that 
A ~5x5, 
A cM~ 
and 
A 
is 
predense 
in 
(P *Q) t(hxh). 
We want to showthatA 
is predense in P *Q. The proof will 
be broken into three steps, and as we proceed we will impose restrictions on 
5, the reader will verify that these restrictions are allowable (in the sense of 
D~) and do not depend on A and G. 
First Step: A G ~ 5, A a c M~ and A ~ is predense in ~G] t 5. 
N 
Proof: The first two facts are immediate. 
Let (io,q),(a,fl) c P * Q. We define J'(p,r 
whenever (p,q) and (at,p) 
are eolifpatible , as the least possible P-part of a condition above (p,q) and 
(a,~) in P * Q. We may assume that for eachp,q 
<5 
f(p,q)(hxh) C5 and 
for each q < 5 the mapping p -~ f@,q) t (5 x 5) forp < 5 belongs to M~. 

129 
Letq c Q[G]r6, and define Dq = ufo~,q)(A) 9 Then~)q ~,Dq 
9 
~)q is dense in P t 6 (as A is predense in (P * Q) r (6 x 6) and by the definition 
of f (p,q)). Hence we may assume that ~)q is predense in .P (by our assump- 
tion that P satsifies the M-c.c.). 
Let r r 
Then for somep 
<6, s eQ and (a,fl) cA we have in P *Q 
N 
G 
(r,S) >-- (p,q ),(a,~). 
As r ~ a (in P), r I[-p "~x 9 G " so r I~p "# 9 A'P"; as 
Np 
r ]~-p"fl <-9 s and q <--9 s "it follows that r ]~-p"q is compatible with some ele- 
ment of A c'' 
As this holds for allr 9 
andDq 
ispredenseinP, 
itistrue 
in V[G], and as this holds in V[G] for all q 9 Q[G] t 6 , we obtain that A a is 
predense in Q[G] r 6. 
Second Step: A a is predense in Q[G]. 
Proof: This follows from the assumption that Q satisfies the M*-c.c. We 
only have to observe here that the restriction to a set in D~" can be substi- 
tuted by a restriction to a set in D~. The proof of this point follows closely 
the proof of the fact that M~ is a O-sequence" 
Third Step: A is predense in P * Q. 
Proof: Let (p,q) c P * Q. Since in V[G] 
A a is predense in Q[G], there 
existr->p

General topologists have been interested 
in what AUT(~CO)/finite) can be 
(p(co) as a Boolean algebra of sets, p(co)/finite is the quotient when we divide 
by the ideal of finite subsets of co). Or equivalently: what can be the group of 
homeomorphisms 
of rico - ~0? 
Note that AUT~CO)) is isomorphic 
to the set of permutations 
of co 
(Per(~o)). It is well known that: 
4.1 Claim: (CH) ig~co)/finite is a saturated 
atomless 
BA ( = Boolean alge- 
bra) 
of power 1t 1 so it has L #1 automorphisms 
(saturated 
in the model 
theoretic sense). 
Remark: This claim will not be used here. 
It is also easy to note that: 
If f EPer(co) 
then 
A/finite 
-*f(A)/finite is 
an 
automorphism 
of 
~g~co)/finite. 
Moreover: 
4.2 Claim: If 3" is a one-to-one function, Dom ()'),Rang (f) are cofinite 
subsets of co then A/finite 
~ f (A)/finite is an automorphism 
of ~co/ 
finite. 
(Such an automorphism 
is called trivial, and we say it is induced by f ). 
4.3 Clain~ If we start with, e.g., V = L, and define finite support iterated 
forcing Pi (i~co2) such 
that

We 
postpone 
the 
work 
concerning 
specifically 
automorphisms 
of 
p(c0)/finite to the next section. To be precise we will prove there the follow- 
ing. 
4.6 
Main Lemma 
: Suppose 
V ~"2~~

an 
~1-oracle, 
Fc AUT(p(~o)/finite ) is not trivial. ': 
Then there is a forcing notion P such that

2) P satisfies the M~ 
3) P introduces a subset X of ca, such that if Q is Cohen forcing, 
P*q 
then in V - there is no Y ~ co satisfying IY (~ F(C) =aeF(B) <=~ X N C =a,B: 
C,B E [p(~)]v I (where A =aeA ? means A ~aeA ? and At caeA, where A Ca, At iff 
A -At is finite). 
Remark: Note we really replace F by some F? from p(r 
to ~(r 
such 
that F(A/finite) = Ft(A)/finite. 
Proof of 4.5. ( assuming 4.6): 

132 
Our ground model is a model of V = L. We intend to define Pi(i "~ ~) as in 
Claim 4.3, so we have F~ predicting any automorphism of D(e~)/finite in V P'* ( 
F~ is a P,-name. So it becomes meaningful when we have defined P,, but using 
~ 
la<o,:cr (~) = od we obtain a schematic definition of the F~'s which does not 
depend on the actual construction of the P,'s). 
So how do we define P~ for i -< ~27 As we are going to iterate with finite 
support, P,(i ": ~2) will be determined as soon as we define < Q.:i < a~2> by 
the relations P0 = [~b], Pi+l = Pi * Q. and P$ = t3 Pi for limit ~. Actually, we 
will define by induction Q. and an wl-oracle M~ c V P~*~ for i < ~2 (remember 
~t 
that having defined Q we have determined P~§ 
so we can go about our next 
task ). 
We assume that F~ c V p~ is a non-trivial automorphism of ]9(~)/finite; oth- 
erwise we let Q be a Pi-name of Cohen forcing and ~r~ be any ~l-oracle in 
V ~§ (remember that ~t~l holds in the ground model and the P~'s satisfy the 
t~l-c.c, and have power < t~2). For each j < i, Pj,i C V Pj is the forcing notion 
(of power t~l) such that P~ = Pj * Pj,, and let/~j+l c V P' (for j < i) be an ~1" 
oracle with the property: if Pj+I,~ ~ Mj-c.c. in VPJ*' and 
Q ]= Mi+l-c.c. in 
V v' 
then Pj+l,i *Q ~ Mj-c.c. in VP'§ 
j§ 
exists by Claim 3.3.). 
Now, let 
M~ E V P~ be an ~01-oracle the satisfaction of whose c.c. implies satisfaction of 
all MJ§ 
for j < i (existing by Claim 3.1 ). Apply now 4.6 in V y~ to obtain 
P = Q~ c V P* satisfying 
1), 2), 3) of 4.6. 
Finally apply Lemma 2.1 
in 
V P~*' = V P~ 
for the type appearing in 3) of 4.6, to obtain an ~l-oracle 
~. c V P~*~ such that the type is omitted in generic extensions of V P~§ with 
forcing notions satisfying the Mi-c.c. 
As P~2 satisfies the t~l-c.c, and has power N 2, there are at most t~" = t~ 2 
P~s-names of reals; on the other hand we have added reals t~ 2 times, so 

133 
Ve'2 I =''2~~ = ~2" 
Pw 
Let F 9 [AUT(]9(co)/finite)] v 2; we want to show that F is trivial. 
If it is 
not, then by Claim 4.4. we know that there is a closed unbounded subset C of 
~2 
with 
the 
property: 
i c C 
implies 
cf (i) # o 1 
or 
F t [p(o)/finite] ~2"~ 9 [AVTO~(~)/finite ] ve~ but is not induced by any f in V P~. 
But 
by 
Claim 
4.3 
we 
can 
find 
i E C 
with 
cofinality 
~l 
satisfying 
F r []9(~)] re* = F i (refer to the remark preceding this proof). So at stage i we 
had Qi introducing X ~ ~ and an ~l-oracle/~i 9 VP**I such that F(X) cannot 
exist in generic extensions of V P~*' with forcing notions satisfying the Mi-c.c. 
Examining our construction and remembering Claim 3.2 it is easy to prove by 
induction on a < ~2 that for a < i in V P~*I, Pi+l,a satisfes the ~-c.c.. 
Hence 
V P'2 = (VP~"~) p'+*''2 is such an extension of V P~§ - a contradiction. 
4.7 Conclusion: In this scheme: 
l) for any second category A c 
la < ~e:cf (a) = ~1 ~ 
A A [~o)] #~' c V P~ and is of 2nd category J 
contains a closed unbounded set. 
2) if A C []9(~)] v~*, A c V P~, A is of 2nd category, then there is an 
oracle ensuring it remains of the 2nd category. 
Proof: For 1) see 4.4, for 2) see 2.2. 
4.8 Conclusion: 
1) We can assume that. in V P'~ any second category set contains 
such subset of cardinality t~ 1. 
2) We can find t~ 1 - dense sets of reals, some of the first category, 
some of the second category. 
3) Baumgartner's 
construction [B4] cannot be carried out here 
as his result fails. 

134 
w Proof of Main Lemma 4.6. 
For a sequence A = <A~:i < a> (a <-- ml) of almost disjoint infinite subsets 
of ~, define 
p(~) = ~f :jr is a partial function from ~ to 2 = 10,1] , f is a finite union 
of functions of the form: 1) finite functions 2) 1~ - finite 3) 0A, - finite ] 
where gn is the function f (a) = JZ if a e A, undefined otherwise, and f- finite 
is f r (dom (f) - A) for some finite A. 
The idea of the proof is as follows: we try to define A = <A~:i < COl> such 
that: P(A) will satisfy the requirements 
of the lernma for X whose charac- 
teristic function is LI[P "P e Gp(2i)~ 
. 
We will have a general pattern 
for 
defining A. Our work will be to show that if all instances of this pattern fail 
then F must be trivial. 
Remark: If the presentation 
does not look rigorous enough to you, look 
at a remark at the end. 
Our first worry is to make P(A) satisfy the M*-c.c. 
The following (*1) 
takes care of this while leaving us with a sufficient degree of freedom in the 
construction of A. 
(*i) If A = <A2-: j < a>, M= is a countable collection of predense subsets 
of P(A), B C ~ is almost disjoint from each Af (] < a) and infinite, the~% we can 
find disjoint , infinite CI,C 2, C 1 U C2 = B such that for every s E |1,2] and 
every 
A c Cg, 
[AI = [C~ --AI =M0, 
every 
.gEM a 
is 
predense 
in 
-A>). 
Proof of (*1): We define by induction on n < ca disjoint finite subsets 
1 
2 
C,~ ,C~ of B such that C~ U Cn 2 D B (5 n. 
In each stage we deal with an obligation of the following kind: 

135 
.9 9 M., T is a term for a member of P(A ^ <A,C,-A>) (or C a in the other 
case ); our task is to ensure W will be compatible with some member of .9 no 
matter how A c C 1 is defined. 
has the form f 
UiA-~ UJc,-.4-~ where i,j 9 
k <e, f eP(A) 
(maybe there will be a contradiction; this is OK ). We don't know what A C~ C.* 
is. There are 2 Ic41 subsets of C~ :A l ..... 
Ae ..... 
for 1 ~s ~ 21c41; look at 
fe = f U i.4~-~ U Jc;-Ae-~. Suppose this is a function, then it belongs to 
P(A), hence is compatible with some gs e .9 Now Dora (ge) N B is finite (by 
B being almost disjoint from every A~. and ge 9 .9 C P()I-)). 
Let : ns = Max (Dam (gs 
/'1 B) for 1 -< s -< 2 Ic~l, and n o = n; 
n" = ~ax I(n e + i):0-< r <- 21&'l{: 
CI+I = C1; 
Taking additional care to make C 1 = g C~, 02 = U C~ infinite, we obtain 
what we need. 
In view of (*i) , it is convenient to introduce the following notation: 
Po, wiu denote the forcing notion corresponding to < A t :j < 
Q will denote Cohen forcing. 
P= will denote the forcing notion corresponding to A = <Aj:j < ~> (we 
delete a from our further notation when, as is usually the case, ~x is fixed). 
Ps 
will denote P(A - <A,Cs 
for g 6 ll,2I, A c C~ as in ('1). 

136 
P~[A] will denote Pr 
* Q. 
If p,q ePolX Q, p = ((2)0,(2)1) and q = ((q )0,(q )l), we will write p U q 
when we mean ((2)0 U (q)0,(2)1 U (q)l). 
Forp eP,.,t, 
q 9 
Q, p Uq means(2 U (q)0,(q)0, etc. 
For A C B, Ch~ will denote 1A U 0B-A- 
Note that (*l) enables us to construct A as follows: We let <An:~% < co> be 
any pairwise disjoint infinite subsets of co. At each later stage, we can use (*1) 
for any infinite B which is almost disjoint from each earlier set ( we can 
always find such B: arrange the earlier sets in an co-sequence <Bn:n 
< co>, 
and let B = Ib,~:n < co| where b~ e H•- U Bin). 
What about Ma? It is taken to include all that is needed in order to 
prepare the satisfaction of the ~'-c.c., as well as additional predense subsets 
which will be specified in the sequel, when their necessity becomes apparent; 
and of course they increase with a. Sometimes, these will be subsets of 
Pax Q which are to remain predense in P~[A], but we can deal with such 
subsets in the framework of ('1) without difficulty . Also, we can preserve 
predensity above a given condition. 
We can define the Ma's together with the 
Aa's. 
Now, in using (*1) we can choose between various candidates for B , and 
for each of them we can choose between various continuations of A (namely, 
we can choose ~ e |1,3| and A c C~). How do we choose? 
In the verification of 3) of the lemma, we have to consider all possible Y 
which are P~, x Q-names of subsets of to. By CH and the ~l-c.c., we can find 
P,, x Q-names Y , which are determined schematically before the actual con- 
~a 
struction of A, so that the sequence < Y :co ~ a < col, a an even ordinal > will 

137 
contain all possible Y each appearing tll-times. [More explicitly, we can iden- 
tify aFfix 
Q-name of a Ycc0withCq~d,lgj

is 
a 
maximal 
antiehain, 
q~j [~-"[~ ~ ~ =- lgj". We consider Y only if M a already ensures us each 
Cq~j: j < c0~ will continue to be a maximal antichain, and it has the right 
form. As there are ~ tl 1 candidates, and each candidate appears wl times 
everything is clear]. Our choice of B,E,A will be as follows: whenever possible, 
we choose them so that [Ch~,~ ]l-p~[A]"Y a N F(Ce) =~ F(A)"] is false, (and 
include some sets in Ma+ 2 as explained below). 
Assume now that P~t otained by such a procedure fails to satisfy the 
requirements of the lemma. As 4.6 (1) is clearly satisfied and we ensured the 
satisfaction of 4.6 (2) , only 4.6 (3) may be false. 
We use this fact for 
X = UIf-l(ll]):f 
c G] where G c P~I is generic. If the existence of appropri- 
ate Y is not forced already by ~b, then some r c P~I x Q forces that there is 
no such Y and in this case P~ rlP "P -~ (r)0] satisfies the requirements of 
the lemma (as the Ma's may take care of the satisfaction of the M'-c.c. by 
such restrictions of P~, as well). Hence we may assume that r forces this. 
So, there is Y= Y (w ~ a < ~al,a even) which realizes the relevant type, and 
N 
N~ 
w.l.o.g, a is large relative to Y (remember each Y appears tl 1 times.) Since 
Ch~.~ I t-p.~ x Q "'X CI C~g = A '" (referring to C~ and A with which we actually 
continued at stage a), it follows that Ch~ It- eol x Q "Y~ N F(C~g) =~ F(A) ': 
Now, when we are at stage awe know Y 
, P= but not P~ . Sowewantto 
N~ 
show that this is already true if we consider forcing in P~[A]. As the forcing 
relation for each formula n c Yis not affected by this shift, our only problem 
arises from the fact that equality is forced to hold only he. This difficulty is 
overcome as follows: if, on the contrary, there is p >- Ch~ in P~[A] forcing 
"Y N F(Ce) #a~ F(A)'; then for each k < ~ the set of those conditions "know- 
ing" some counterexample to the equality above k is predense above p in 

138 
P~[A]; so, as we remarked above, we can assume this predensity is still true 
in P~, x O , but ( asp -> Ch~) 
P ]~-P,,xO "YN F(C~) =aeF(A)", a contradic- 
tion. 
So, ChcA~ I~/~[A]"Y N F(Cs =ae F(A)" But we chose B,~ and A doing our 
best to avoid this, so we must have had no better choice; thus: 
(*2) Let B be infinite and almost disjoint from each Aj(j < a), and let 
B = C 1 U C2 be the partition obtained in ('1). Then for every s ~ ~1,21 and 
everyA ~ Cs such that I A I = I Cs 
I =e0, 
Ch~, II-~[A] " Y C~ F( C~) =,. F(A ) '" 
We now assume B is as in ('2) and concentrate 
on C1; C 2 can be treated 
similarly. So now we shall use PQ][A]. 
Let Pax 
Q = [ps 
<~J, 
and let for n <~, 
~n be a dense subset of 
Pax Q, ~ 
= |q~:i <~], 
such that q~ I~-P~xQ"[n e Y] --- t~ ~'' ( t~ ~ denotes a 
truth value, 1 is true, 0 is false). 
We shall now define by induction on /c < co a natrual number n~ and a 
function ~f~:a~-, 10,1] where a k = [n~,n~+l)(3 C1. 
We want our n~,~f k to 
satisfy (*3) and (*4) which follow: 
Let us denote by IF(t:) the set of the functions f, Dom (f) a proper initial 
segment of C 1 - [0,n~) , Rang (f) ~ 10,1]. 
(*3) (a) n0 = 0

We have now to convince the reader that we can define n~,f~ that satisfy 
(*3) , (*4). Assume that we have defined n 0 ..... 
n~_l,n ~ and f0 ..... 
fk-1 
and we want to define n~+l,f~. We have finitely many tasks, of three types: 
(i) 
instances 
of 
(*3), 
c) 
namely: 
given 
s < k, 
m <n k, 
J' :Ct N [0,•k) -* |0,1], t, we have to satisfy " if for some i ..... 
(ii) instances of (*4) (da), namely: given s </c, go,g1 c 10,1] [~ 
A c~, we 
try to satisfy "for no m 9 9 9 " (but sometimes we fail - then we remember 
the 
failure for (iii)). 
(iii) failures of (*4)(d~) in the past: given a task of type (ii) which we did 
not fulfil at a previous step, we have to satisfy (da) for k (*) = our present k. 
We will define 3"~ by taking approximations 
of it in IF(k), each one of them 
intended to fulfil one task and containing its predecessor 
- this ensures that 
once we have constructed 
an approximation 
fulfilling a given task, the f~ 
that we will eventually obtain will also fulfil it. Our initial approximation 
is an 
arbitrary element of IF(It) assuming the values 0 and 1 . 

140 
So now we deal separately with each type: 
(i) Assuming such i exists (with fk interpreted as our current approxi- 
mation of it), let j be the least such i. The addition of h can create a con- 
tradiction only inside C 1 (by the definition of IF(k +1)), and since C 1 is almost 
disjoint from the domain of any condition in Pa (in this case (ps U q~)0), by 
defining fk in the dangerous finite portion according to (p~ U q~n)0 we fulfil 
our task. 
(ii) Let IFc(k ) denote the subset of IF(k) consisting of those functions 
containing our current approximation of fk. Assume that: 
There 
exists 
f e IFr 
such 
that 
for 
every 
m c F(C1), 
m>Sup(Dom(f)), 
and 
for 
every fteIFc(k ), ftDf, 
and 
for 
every 
i(O),i(1) <co, if for every f" e IFc(k), f" D f? 
both go uf" 
UPs 
uq~0) 
andgl 
uf" 
UP~ U q~l) areinPa 
x Q thent~o) =t~l ). 
Assuming this, we take such f as our next approximation of f~, which will 
satisfy this instance of (Cla). So if we fail, we know that: 
For every f eIFr 
there 
are m eF(C1), 
m>Sup(Dom(f)) 
and 
ft e IFc(~: ), ft ~ f 
and i(O),i(1) < a) such that t~To) ~ t~l ) and for every 
f" elFc(k), f" ~ft 
both goUf" 
UP~ uq~0) 
and gIuf" 
UPs 
U q~l) 
are in Pa • Q- 
(iii) Adapting our notation to that of (ii), we denote our present k as 
k (*) and assume that the property written at the end of (ii) held for s < k 
and go,g1 e [0,1J [~ 
n c, 
We are given h c 10,1] [n*§ 
r cl; let fo(,) be our current approxima- 
tion of f~(,) and use the property for f = fk U h U fo(,) to obtain re,f t, 
i(O),i(1) as described there. Letting f~(o) = ft-(f~ U h) and extending it if 
necessary to ensure that m < n~(,)+l, we obtain f~(,) fulfilling our task. 

141 
So the definition of n k,fk can be carried out. Our treatment 
from here 
on concentrates 
on A * = U a3k+l. The other two thirds of C 1 can be treated 
k <e~ 
similarly. Let f ~ = U (f3~ U f3k+2), A1 =f *-1(11|). Notice that by (*3) b), 
both A 1 and its complement in Dom (f ~ are infinite. 
Thus, from ('21 it follows that: 
(*5) For every A ~ A*, Ch~. O f ~ ]bp~[AUAt]"YC~ F(C1) =~ F(A O A1)". 
Hence, for every A C A ~ , Ch~, U f ~ can be extended to a condition forcing 
equality above a certain n and in particular deciding for each m m n in F(C1) 
whether it belongs to Y (as no other names are involved in the equality). 
Looking at p(A ~ as a topological space, we conclude (as IPa x Q I = ~0): 
(*6) 
There 
exist 
a 
condition 
p * E Pax Q, 
Dora(p*) NA*CDom(h~ 
CA*,andn'<~suchthat 
a 
finite 
h ", 
.~ = IA C A" : h ~ cCh~, and for each m -> n ~ in F(C1) 
[p" u ch~. u f" IFp[[AuA,]"~ c Y"orp" u Ch2. u f" II-~[AuA,] '''~ r ~'11 
is of the second category everywhere "above" h* (i.e., its intersection 
with any open set determined 
by a finite extension of h* is of the second 
category). 
We now define, for A c _~, 
FI(A ) : |ned F( C1) : p ~ U ChA~ U f ~ II--.P~'[AU, Ad ''m C Y"] 
It follows from (*5) that 
(*6A) F(A U A1) =a, FI(A) for all A c _~. 
We will verify next that _3 is a Borel set. The demand h ~ c Ch~. defines 
an open set, and then we have a conjunction over all m ~ n* in F(C1) of con- 

142 
ditions each requiring that p ~ (3 Ch~, U f ~ decide whether m belongs to Y. 
Denoting 
_,4q = ~A cA ~ 
is 
incompatible 
with 
p ~ U Ch~, Uf~ 
and 
remembering 
that s 
= ~q~ : i < r 
is dense in Pax Q and we can preserve 
its predensity in P~[A UA1], we see that A c A" satisfies the requirement for 
m if[ it belongs to [C~l_~qt~ : i < ~ , t~ m is true ]] U [(~l-~q~ :i < ~, t~ m is false 
~]. As each _~q is open, we have shown that _~4 is Borel. 
As _,4 is a Borel set, we know by a theorem of Baire that (by extending h *) 
we may assume that |A c A" : A r _2, h" c Ch~, ] is of the first category. 
Let k be large enough so that n3~ m ~z ~ and JZ < 3k -1 where p ~ = pg. 
For A 9 
let t~ denote the truth value of m 9 FI(A ). Then for every 
m 9 [n3~: , n3~+s ) C~ F(C1), 
P ~ U ChAA 9 t) f ~ is compatible with some q~n but 
is not compatible with any q~n such that t~ m # t~ n (remember the definitions of 
9 FI(A ) and _,4 and observe that m ~ n*, m 9 F(C1) ). 
Hence 
by 
(c) 
of 
(*3) 
t~ 
is 
determined, 
for 
A 9 _,4 
and 
m 9 [n3~ , na~+3 ) N F(C1), 
by 
Ch~, r [0,n3~+4 ) = Ch~. r [0,n3~+2); 
that 
is: 
t~ = t 
iff 
for 
some 
i, 
t~ m = t 
and 
for 
every 
h 9 IF(3Ir +4) 
Ch~, t [0,n3~+2 ) U/" ~ r [0,n3~+4) U h U P ~ U q m 9 p= x Q. 
Now we want to show that t~ is determined 
(for A,m 
as above) by 
Ch~. r a3~+i 
alone. 
So 
let 
us 
assume 
that 
A (~ , A (0 e _~4 
and 
Ch~- F a3~+l = Ch~. r a3~+1, and for some m 9 [~%3k,~3~+3) C% F(C1) we have 
t~ 
# t~,~. Let for t = 0,1 
gt(ChAC2 U f ~ r ([0,n3k_l) N Cl)- From the way 
t~0~ , t~l) are determined 
(see end of former paragraph) 
and their being dis- 
tinct, 
it follows that 
at stage 
3k-1 
of (*4), for the 
above go,g1 
and 
p" = ps , (da) fails ( take h = f " r (a3k U a3~+2 Ua3~+3)U 
Ch~ r176 t a3~+l, 
which does not depend on t). Hence (dS) holds in this case. 
Using this, we 
want to construct B(~ 
(1) e _,4 such that their characteristic functions agree 
with those of A(~ 
(1) respectively up to n3~_ 1, and agree with each other 
from there on, while for infinitely many m 9 F(C1), ChA m2 and ChA s~,*) deter- 

143 
mine t]~o),t~l) respectively to be distinct. 
Since B (~ =~ B (1), also by (*6A) 
FI(B(~ 
=~ F(B(~ U A1) =a. F(B(O U A1) =ae FI(B(1)), so this will be a con- 
tradiction. Thus, it remains to show how to carry out the construction of 
B(~ 
(1). We do it by an m-sequence of finite approximations. 
We start with the respective sections of A(~ 
(1) up 
to r~ak_ 1. 
As 
A(~ 
(1) ~.~, 
both sections are compatible with h', 
so we first extend 
B (~ 
(1) 
(finitely 
and 
identically) 
so 
that 
they 
contain 
h'. 
As 
IA ~ A ~ 
r ..~ , h ~ ~ CA~. ~ is of the first category, we have a countable fam- 
ily of nowhere dense subsets of p(A ~ which are to be avoided by B(~ 
(1), in 
order that B(~ 
(1) E_~. So we arrange all these tasks (each time dealing 
with either B (~ or B (1) and one nowhere dense subset) in a sequence, and by 
the definition of "nowhere dense " we obtain each time a finite extension of 
our former approximations which ensures the implementation of our task. 
We will show that our construction is all right by proving: if k (*) > 3k-1 
and k(*) --- 2 (mod 3 ) then there is m E F(C1) A [n~(,.),n~(*)+l) such that for 
t = 0,1 there are i(t) < co such that t~0) ~ t~r~l) and for every h E IF(It(*)§ 
CAA ~2) t[O,n~(.)) uf 
~ 
uh 
UP* uq~t) 
cPax 
Q. To prove this, 
use (d~) for such /c(*) and h = (Ch~ ') U f ") t [n3~,n~(.)). We thus get a con- 
tradiction. 
So, by the last four paragraphs and (*6A), as F is an automorphism and 
A 1 is fixed, we have proven. 
(*7) There are functions F~ :]9(a3~+1 ) -* ]")(F(A *) N [n3~ ,n3~+3)) 
such 
that 
for 
every 
F(A) =ae F(AuA1) - F(A1) =ae FI(A) - F(A1) =~ 
U Fk(A N as~.+l). 
Ir <f9 
AEA 
Now, (*7) would be good enough (as we shall see later) if it were not res- 
tricted to .~. So we want to achieve a similar result without this restriction. 

144 
We define by induction a sequence of pairs <ur 
< co) such that 
<u~:g < co> 
is 
a 
partition 
of A*-Dom(h') 
into 
finite 
subsets 
and 
ge:urZ --, [0,11, as follows: for r < co, let -~2r = --d2r+l be the r-th element in a 
sequence 
of 
nowhere 
dense 
subsets 
of 
]D(A *) 
showing 
that 
IA C A*:A r ...d , h" C Ch~.] is of the first category. Each <ue,gr 
is defined 
so that: 
(i) ug is disjoint from Urn for all m < g. 
(ii) ifs e(A*-Dom(h*))-- 
U um theng eu~. 
m<g 
(iii) ifA cA ~ , g~ c ChAA 9 thenA ~_.d~. 
To see that this is possible, use the fact that _.de is nowhere dense taking into 
account 
one 
after 
the 
other 
all 
the 
elements 
of 
[0,11~ 
where 
v =( U u,n) uDom(h*)- 
m<lZ 
Now, for t =0,1 let At*= OU2r+t andgt'= 
Og2r+t. Then Dom(g0 =At* 
and <Aj,A;,Dom(h")> 
is a partition of A*. 
From (iii) it follows that if 
h" 
Ch~. then A c 
A cA', 
Dg;c 
-~. 
From (*7) we can thus derive a definition for F(A CI A~) working uni- 
formly for all A cA* (using (*7) for (A V/A~) LJ (g; LJ f ")-1(|1]))- Similarly 
we can derive a definition for F(A VIAl). 
From these two definitions, 
remembering that Dom (h *) is finite, we obtain: 
('8) There are functions Gk:p(ask+l ) -* ]')(F(A") 0 [na~,?zs~+3)) such that 
for everyA C A* F(A) :v~ D Gk(A (~ a3k§ 
With this result in hand, we have.good control of F r ]9(A *). We prove first: 
(*9) For every large enough/c and disjoint b 1,b2 C a3~+1, 

145 
Otherwise 
there 
is an infinite 
S c~o, and b~,by c aak+l for k e S, 
b~ n by =~b, 
CT~(b~) N C%(b~) #~b. 
Then 
let 
A 1 = ub~ 
, A 2= ubY. 
/~eS 
/ceS 
Clearly A I N A2 = ~, AI.A2 C A ~ and F(AI) n F(A2) #~ ~. This contradicts 
F/finite commuting with N. 
Similarly as F commutes with U 
('10) For every large enough k and disjoint b 1,b2 c a3k+t, 
C~(bl U 52) = C~(bl) U C,~(b2) 
and as F is onto (and monotonic) 
(*ll) For every large enough k, for any singleton b c (Z3/r 1 
C%(b ) is a singleton. 
Define g, Dora (g) = A', G~(IIZ]) = g(g) for g 9 as~+1,k large enough. So 
clearly by (*8) - (*I1): 
('12) For every A c A ", F(A) =he g(A) ~Ylg(i):i 9 AI and g is one-to-one. 
Remember that A ~ is one third of C 1. Doing this separately for each third 
and then the same for C a, we obtain for every B which is almost disjoint from 
each Aj(j < ix): (that we can get a one-to-one g is proved like (*9)) 
('13) There is a one-to-one function g, Dora (g) =a, B, such that 
(VA C B)[g(A)=~ F(A)]. 
Let `9= ~A C o:Ftf~A)/ =he is induced by some function g 
as above ]; 
clearly .9 is an ideal. Let J be the ideal generated by IAj:j < a] and the finite 
subsets of co. 
Let J1 = ~B c c0:(YA e ~)IB N A ] < ~0|. Clearly, ~1 is also an ideal. 

146 
In our new terminology, ('13) states that ~1 c ~. 
It follows that every infinite A c co contains an infinite subset in ~ - since 
we can construct 
A as before with A 0 = ~-A (w.l.o.g. , A 0 is infinite), and then 
take any infinite B E ~l and discard its finite intersection with A 0. 
Notice also: 
('14) Every A which is not in ~ contains an infinite subset in ~l- 
To see this, let <B n:n < a~> be an r 
of the generators of ~. 
We try to define a sequence 
<a n:n <~> 
such that a m #an for m <~ 
and 
a n c A - 
U Bn. If we succeed we obtain a subset as required. 
If we cannot 
define a n , then 
A c( 
U Bin)U lain :m <n], 
hence 
A E~, contrary 
to our 
rn ~:~z 
assumption. 
As every infinite subset of ~ contains an infinite subset in .~, we could 
have constructed 
A with each Aj c ~. So we assume now that we do this and 
fail (to satisfy the requirements 
of the lemma). 
Our former results apply, of 
course, to this construction 
{for some a). 
Let B E ~i be infinite, B = C i U C2 as in (*1). 
(*15) Letg induce Fr/')(B) (in the sense of (*13)), and letI~ c 11,2]. 
Then for everyp 
E Pa x Q there are g, p ~ q c Pax 
Q and n such that: 
(Vm c Cs 
~_n :::::::> [c 1 U I<m,O>J Ibe.xr 
r r']) 
(v,,~ e c~)(~ =-~ -----> [q u t<~,i>l 
IFP.,,q"g(m) c ~"]) 
Proof of ('15): Suppose 
it fails for g,p 
, and 
, w.l.o.g., s = i. 
Let 
igi~:iZ < ~] be the set of all conditions in P~ • Q above p. Let n -* ((n)0,(~)1) 
be a mapping of a onto ~ • ~. 

147 
We 
will 
define 
functions 
h n(~z < ca), 
h n 
increasing 
and 
finite, 
Dom (h~) c Ci, Rang (h~+l-h~) = ~0,1], and if n r163 C~ then n E Dora (h~+~); we 
will also define rn~ ~ Cl(n < ca), as follows: 
We let h 0 = (P)o r (Dom ((P)o) r~ Cl). 
Assume that we have defined h~, and we will see how we define ~ 
and 
hn+ 1. If h n is not compatible with q(~)0,~ is chosen arbitrarily and hn+ 1 ~ h~ 
is chosen in accordance with our requirements above. If h~ is compatible 
with q(,~)o, we use our assumption for q = h~ U q(n)0" Notice that if m is large 
enough 
then 
m if Dom (q) f~ C 1 
and 
[m E C 1 ~ 
g (m) 
is 
defined, 
g(rn) ~_ F(C1) , g(m) ~- (n)l ]. So we can find m = rn n E C i satisfying all these, 
and, e.g., ~, U q(~)o U ~('~,0> ! I/-~.~Q"g("~) if r". 
Let 
qJ ~ h~ u q(~)o u ~(,~,,o> i 
force 
.,g(.~) ~ r: 
Let 
h~+l = (qJ)0 r (Dom ((qnt)0) (3 C1), 
and 
let 
h~+ 1 D h~+ I 
satisfy 
Rang (hn+ 1 -hn) = ~0,1{ and n 9 Dom (hn+l) if n e C 1. 
Now, Dora (U hn) = Ci. 
Let A c C1 be the subset with characteristic 
function 
U hn. 
A 
and 
C1-A 
are 
infinite, 
so 
by 
(*2) 
ChAc, I~e[[A] ''Y (~ F(C1) =a~ F(A)"" By our choice of h o, Ch~., = U h~ is com- 
patible with p, so some extension of p U ChoAI in P~[A] forces for some 
integer equality above it. Let n be such that: 
q(~)0 U Chc A, II-pflA] ''Y N F(Cl) - (n)l = F(A) - (n)~" 
and F(A ) - (n)l = g (A ) - (n)l. 
We refer now to the definition of ran, hn+ 1. Since h n ~ Ch~, is compatible 
with 
q (~)o, 
we 
had 
qtnll-p, xQ"g(mn) EY'" 
where 
qt 
was 
above 
h~ U q(n)0 U ~mn,0) 
{ (or it could be the other case, with g(m~) if Yand 
~m~,l>; 
this is dealt with similarly). Now, m n if A since h~+ 1 says so, hence 

148 
g(mn) r g(A). 
As g(rn~) ~- (n)l, g(mn) CF(A); bat g(mn) oF(C1), hence 
q(n)0 U Ch~, I~-p[[A]"g(rnn) ~ }'". But qt forces the opposite (we know it in 
-Pax Q, but it does not matter), and they are compatible (since q(n)0 C qn t and 
a contradiction between Ch~, and qJ is impossible by our choice of ht+l) - a 
contradiction. So we have finished the proof of ('15). 
We define now, for every p c Pa x Q, a partial function from ~ to ~ as fol- 
lows: 
gp(,..n) = k 
iff 
[p u I/xm,O> I II-,,:',,,,q ''k r ~" 
and 
P U ~{m,1) { I]-P.• 
c Y"and/c is the only one satisfying this]. 
Our intention in defining gp is to have a function (for the Lime being - 
countably many functions) which induces F r ]:)(B) uniformly for all B c ill. 
('16) For every B c J1 and every p c Pa x Q there is q, p -~ q E Pax Q, 
such that/? Cae Dora (gq) and (VA C B)F(A) =ae gq(A). 
Proof of (*16): IF H is finite then there is nothing to prove, so we 
assume that H is infinite. Let g exemplify H < .9 (remember fil C ~). 
Let us call k a candidate Lo be gp(m), if it satisfies the first two parts of 
the definition ( but maybe not the uniqueness requirement). We notice that if 
/c is a candidate to be gp(m) and /ct is a candidate to be gp(mt), m #rot, 
then k # let ( consider p U I~rn,0~,(mt, 
l)], 
it forces both k ~ Y and 
kt E Y). Notice also that in ('15) we have shown that for large enough m c C~ 
N 
(and appropriate q) g (m) is a candidate to be gq (m). 
Thus, given B and p, we apply ('15) first for s = 1 and p, and then for 
= 2 and the condition obtained for ~ = 1, obtaining q ='p such that for 
large enough m c.B g(m) is a candidate to be gq(m). Now, it suffices to 
show that B Ea~ Dom (gq), since whenever gq(m) is defined there is only one 

149 
candidate, but g (m) is one, so for almost all m c B 
gq (rn) = g (m) and we 
know that g induces F r ]9(B). 
Assume that B ~a, Dora (gq). Then w.l.o.g. B is disjoint from Dom (gq) 
and we have k m (m E B) such that/c m and g(rn) are distinct candidates to be 
ga(m). Let C = I/r 
C/~!. Then C is infinite and disjoint from g(B) (as no 
k is a candidate for two re's). 
We let D = F-I(C); then as g(B) =a, F(B),, D is 
almost disjoint from B. 
Case I:/) ~ 81" 
In this case, we apply ('15) for D and q twice (as we did above for B and 
p) to obtain qt _~ q such that for large enough mt c D 
gt(mt) is a candidate 
to be gq~(mt) (where gt induces F r/9(D)). 
But for large enough mt c D 
mt~B 
and gt(mt) is a 
candidate to be gqr 
for some mcB 
(as 
gt(D) =he F(D), F(D) = |lcm:m e B], and q < qt e Pa x Q) - a contradiction 
(as in the beginning of the proof of (*16) we observe no k is a candidate to be 
gq~(n) for two n's). 
Case II: D ~ ill. 
Then w.l.o.g. D c Aj for some j < a. By strengthening q we can assume 
w.l.o.g, that tAj -finite ~ q or 0Aj - finite -< q. Assume that the former is the 
case (the second case is dealt with similarly). 
Then q ]~-p, lxq"A j Ca* X", 
hence q I~p,• 
~ Y". As we have seen in the proof of ('2), by 
preserving the predensity of (countably many) appropriate subsets above 
corresponding conditions, we can 
conclude that c 1 ]l-p,xr 
Y". 
Hence there are n and qt k q in Pax Q such that qt ][-p, xq,,nt c Y'" for all 
~zt ~ F(Aj), nt ~ n. But C Ca* _~'(Aj) , so taking nt =/c~n large enough we know 
that nt is a candidate to be gqt(m) - a contradiction. 
So we have finished the proof of ('16). 

150 
('17) Forp 1,P2 9 Pa x Q, 
B = ~n:gp,(n),g~,,(n) are defined and distinct J 9 ~. 
Proof of (*17): If not, then by ('14) there exists an infinite tYl 9 ~1 such 
that gp,,gp, are defined everywhere in B 1 but they never agree there. By ('16) 
we can find for i = 1,2 q~ ~ p~ such that t71 ~ae Dom (gq,) and 
(VA ~ BOF(A ) =ae gq,(A). 
It follows that gql t t71 =ae gq~ r t71; otherwise, we 
have an infinite /72 c/71 on which the functions never agree, and we can 
divide /?2 into three parts each having disjoint images under the two func- 
tions (decide inductively for n 9 
to which part is belongs, a good decision 
always exists as the functions are one-to-one); one part at least is infinite, 
call it /?3, then F(B3) is almost equal to both gql(B3) and gqe(/?3) which are 
disjoint. 
But, whenever gp,,gq, are both defined they must agree (since 
ql ~Pl), and the same holds forp2,q2, so we obtain that gp~ t/71 =ae gp t/71, 
contradicting our assumption. So ('17) holds 
By arranging the conditions in Pax Q in an co- sequence and using ('17) 
we obtain that there is a partial function gO from co to ~ such that for every 
p epax 
Q 
~z:gp(n) is defined but g~ 
is not defined or is #gp(n)] c~. 
Hence, by (*16), for every/? 9 ~1, B ~ae Dom (gO) and 
(Va c P)F(A) =~ g~ 
We have almost achieved our goal of inducing F t ]9(/t) uniformly for all 
B e ~1- the missing point is that we want go to be one-to-one. But this must 
be true after discarding from Dora (gO) a set in ~, because otherwise we can 
construct 
<b,~:n < co> with b n # b m for n # m, g~176 
) and 
B = ~bn:n < c0~ 9 fll (see the proof of ('14)); then for large enough n and an 
appropriate gq (inducing F tD(B)) g~ 
) = gq(bn), so gq is not one-to-one, a 
contradiction. 
Since discarding a set in ~ does not affect the other proper- 
ties of gO we have a one-to-one gO inducing F r ]9(/?) uniformly for all/? 9 ill- 
As (Vj < a)Aj 9 ..9, and they are almost disjoint, a < ~1, there is g 1 , one- 

151 
to-one partial function from r to r 
so that for every 17 c ~, F(B) =a* gt(B) 
and B ~a, Dom (gl). Clearly Dom (gl) (j Dora (gO) is co-finite (use ('14)). 
Let fl* be the ideal fl Ufl, generates. Let D = in:gl(n) #- g~ 
and both 
are defined J. 
If D fs ~" we can find (as we found B 3 C B 2 in the proof of ('1.7)) D i c D 
such that D 1 ~* 
and gl(D1) ~ g~ 
= ~b. 
As F is onto, for some D t C Dr, F(Dt) == F(D1) N g~ 
Then Dt c fit, 
otherwise 
it has an infinite 
subset 
D~ c J, 
so r(D"t)=azgl(D't) hence 
F(D'~) c~ gl(D1), but F(D~) Cae F(D~) co, g~ 
a contradiction. Similarly, 
Dt - Dr c fl; so D1 c ~*, a contradiction. 
So D c~*, hence by trivial changes in gO,gt D =~b. Let g =gl ugO. 
For every A E ~* 
F(A) =~ g (A), so as fl* is dense, F is an automorphism , 
this holds for any A. 
As F(c0) =a~ g(Dom (g)), Rang (g) 
is co-finite. 
Why can we assume g is one-to-one? No integer can have an infinite ori- 
gin set A, since then F(A) is infinite while g(A) is a singleton. 0nly finitely 
many integers can have a non-singleton origin set, otherwise we would have 
two disjoint infinite sets with the same infinite image under g. So we can 
throw out the problematic finite part of g. 
Thus F is trivial. 
Remark: If you were not satisfied with the proof, because of the 
retreats (i.e., "we could have .... ") here is a short explanation. 
Suppose _~r~ 
are given in a universe V (and M* is an col-oracle, hence 
V ~= CH), and F is a function from ]9(o) to ]9(o) such that F induces an auto- 
morphism of ]9(o)/finite.

V a- PROPERNESS AND NOT ADDING REA[~ 
w 1 Iteration of forcing notions which does not add reals. 
Next to not collapsing 111 not adding reals seems the most natural require- 
ment on forcing notion. There are many works deducing various assertions 
from CH and many others who did it from diamond of 111- If we want to show 
that the use of diamond is necessary, we usually have to build a model of ZFC 
in which CH holds but the assertion fails, by iterating suitable forcing. A cru- 
cial part in such a proof is showing that the forcing notions do not add reals 
even when we iterate them. So we want a reasonable condition on Q (in V P~) 
which ensures that forcing with Pa does not add reals when ~Pi,O:i < coa is a 
CS iterated forcing system. Another representation of the problem is "find a 
parallel of MA consistent with C.C.H.". 
The specific question which drew my attention to the above was whether 
there may be a non-free Whitehead group of power 111 (from [Sh 74] we knew 
that there is no such group if V = L or even if ~.r holds for any stationary 
S C co 1, and that there is such a group if MA + 21% > 111holds)- This is essen- 
tially equivalent to: is there a stationary S c co 1, and for each 3 E S an 
unbounded subset A S of order-type ~0, such that A = ~As:~ c S t 
has the uni- 
formization property. It is easy to see that ~ 
implies (Ai:i c S t 
does not 
have the uniformization property (and in II 4.3 , we proved, from ZFC + MA 
+ 2 t% > 111, that A has the uniformization property). 
The solution was surprising. By Devlin and Shelah [DS] (see XIV w here ), 
there is,a variant ~1 of ~ 
which not only follows from CH but is equivalent 
1 
to 211~ < 2111. This variant implies many consequences of the diamond (see [Sh 
1987], and in the systematic development in Avraham and Shelah [ASh] ere). 

154 
In particular <A~:6 E S> does not have the uniformization property when 
S c Din, i.e. S contains a closed unbounded subset of t01. This still leaves open 
the question for S a stationary costationary subset of ml. Now for such sets 
it was proved in [Sh 77] that the uniformization property may hold for a fixed 
stationary costationary subset S of ~1, (i.e. for all <A~:/~ c S>, A~ C6 
unbounded of order type ~). However 
r 
~,-S (and even 
r 
~,_~) may 
still hold:) 
Notation: In this chapter ~,/~ will stand for uncountable cardinals, if not 
explicitly stated otherwise. 
1.1 Definition: Let E be a family of subsets of 
S~Q(/~) (we assume 
always 
S~0(/~ 1 E E, so /~ is reconstructible from E but using specific E we 
may forget to write 
~t%(/~), particularly using a stationary S ~ ~1 more 
exactly IS] 1- 
(1) We say that E is non trivial if for every k large enough, there 
is a countable N < <H(k),~>, E c N and N n ~ E A for every A c E CI N. We 
say in such cases that N is suitable for E. 
(21 We say, for a non-trivial E,that a forcing notion P is E- 
complete if for every ~, large enough, and N ~ <Y(A),e> countable, suitable 
for E, to which P belongs, the pair (N,P) is complete (see below). 
(31 The pair (N,P 1 is complete if every generic sequence 
<pn:n < ~> for (N,P) has an upper bound in P, where: 
(4) <p~:n < a~> is a generic sequence for (N,P) if Pn e P n N, 
P ]=Pn "=Pn+l, and for every dense open subset .9 of P which belongs to N, 
.9 n Ip,,:n < ~l ~ r 
1.2 Claim: In the definition, in (1) for all k such that E, 
SB (/~) c H(k) 
0 
we get the same answer (so we may replace the universal quantifier on ~. by 

155 
existencial). 
Proof: Easy, by an argument similar to the proof of II 2.2. 
Explanation of (4) k is big enough to ensure everything about P, forc- 
ing etc ... is expressible in H(~,), now as N is a submodel, it is legitimate to ask 
what goes on when you force with P starting in N, of course a generic 
sequence is not far from being a generic subset, so what (4) says is that for 
any generic extension N[G], there is p 9 P who knows everything about it. 
(G c P N N generic over N). 
1.3 Theorem:

(2) If Q=<Pi,Q :i < a>

Remark: So in (2) it is enough to assume E is not trivial and 
" if E is not trivial then Q is E-complete. " 
~~. 
Proof: (1) Let N ~<H(k),C> 
be suitable for E, PcN 
hence (N,P)is 
complete. 
Choose <lon:n < ~> a generic sequence for (N,P), Po =P and 
choose p * -~ p,~ for all n < ~. Since p ~ is (N,P)-generic by corollary III 2.13 
p* [~-" N[ G] .~ <H(k),c>; E 9 N[ G ] and N[ G ] N tz = g N I~': hence

So p ~ force N[G] to exemplify that E is not trivial. 
(2) Let k be big enough, g ~<H(>,),9 
suitable for E. And 
<pn:n < co> be a generic sequence for (N,P=). (note Pn ~ N, Dompn count- 
able hence Dompn

1.4 Claim: (1) The minimal normal fine filter on

Then Pa = Lim Q satisfies the ~

phism we promised in the Fact so we have proved the fact. 
Continuation of the proof of 1.6: Now choose IP~ c Pa ('/N~:s < ~ such

Define a condition r as follows: Domr = (a CI N,) U (a fl Nj),

if there is such a bound , and otherwise ~b, for ~ c a ~ Nj 
r(~) will be a name 
of an upper bound of lp~(~):n < ~] if there is such an element, and otherwise 
~b. It suffices to prove that for every 7 <a

r7. We shall 
prove by induction on 7 < a that for every n < 
p~r T, p~F T<<-r iT. 
For 7 limit, it follows from the induction hypothesis. 
For 7 = ( + 1, notice that Domp~ C N~ CI a, Domp~ C Nj N a, and

1.6 Theorem: Suppose in V 
CH holds, and E is a non-trivial family of 
subsets of 
SH0(/z), ~' = X- 
*) 
Then V has a generic extension V 1 by proper forcing in which: 
a) CH holds, E is not trivial, 2 ~' = X, and 
b) If P is E-complete proper forcing notion, IPI = ~l 
and ~)~ ~ P is dense for i < i 0 < cfx 
then 
there is a directed G ~P, G CI~)~ #~bfori 
<i 0 
Remark: (1) We can replace i < cf X by i < X1 where X1 < X is regular. 
(2) Properness is not essential in the proof of the theorem, it's use will appear 
in 1.7. 
(3) Also the reader should be aware of the fact that Dao(/z )- completeness is 
more than properness, otherwise 1.6 would say: MA~I ^ CH which is of course 
impossible. 
Proof: 
We 
use 
countable 
support 
iterated 
forcing 
systems 
<Pi,Q.:i < a>such that a<n + and I[-e, " IQ.] =sl, Q. is proper and is E- 
complete ": 
For any such system Q, Lira Q is an E-complete forcing notion which satisfies 
the B2-chain condition. 
For any such ~l we can find ~2 lengthening it such 
that (let Ps = Lim Q~): 
A) V ~ 
has subsets of ~1 not in 
V el (if Q~ =<P~,Q~ "i <a~>, let 

a 2 = a 1 + 1,Q=t 
or, if we like. 
159 
= ~f :f 9 ~ 
ordered by inclusion). 
B) If R 9 V Pt is a forcing notion either in V P~ there is a directed subset 
generic over V P', or V P' ~"IRI 
>t~l " or R is not proper, or for no 9 2 
(lengthening 91) is R 
E-complete in V Pz''. 
Using A and B and any list of tasks, there is no problem to find Q as 
above, such that forcing with Lim Q gives a generic extension as required. 
1.7 Conclusion: In the model from 1.6, if E = t~1-S], S C o 1, stationary 
costationary the following holds: 
a) for any As c 5 unbounded of order type o, for 5 e S, ((A~:8 9 S> ,t%) 
has the uniformization property. 
b) S is still stationary (by properness). 
Proof: Let <A$:6 c S> be as above, Is:A~-, ~, 
Q = |f:f a function 
from some 
a <wi 
to 
~, 
such 
that 
for 
every &---a, 6 9 
(6 
limit) 
3" tA~=a, fstA~] 
We have to check. 
Fact A: Q is E-complete. 
Fact B:Ifp c Q, Domp -< a < r 
then there is q,p - q c Q, Dora q = a. 
Fact C: If p c Q, A c ~1 - Domp is finite, f a function from A to ~ then 
there isq,p <-q E Q,f cq. 
Fact D: Q is proper. 
Proof of Fact A: Trivial. 

160 
Proof of Fact B: Let ~6~:g < j -< ~1 be a list of all limit ordinals 6 9 S, 
Dora p < 6 -< a. As A~, has order type ~, and Sup (A~) = 6~. A$~ (~ A~ is finite 
for m <s 
hence we can define for s <~, fie <6e such that fig->Domp. 
fig > Max (A~ C~ Ae,) for m < g. Now define q , a function from a to ~: 
p (i) 
i 9 Domp 
q(~) = 
j'~(i) 
~ 9 (A~-~e) 
0 
otherudse (but (i < a) 
Now q is well defined as the fl~ were defined such that the A$,- fie are 
pairwise disjoint and disjoint to Domp. 
It is trivial to check q 9 Q. 
Proof of Fact C: Let A = lae:~Z < m {, and we define by induction 
pg(s <_ 2rn), 
P0 =P, Domp2e+l = at~, 
Domp2e+l = ag+l, 
P2e+l(ae) = f(ae),P~ <--Pe+l. Now the definition ofp2e+ I is by Fact B, and the 
definition 
of Pae+2 
is direct 
[it belongs 
to 
Q as 
for every limit 6, 
6 - Domp2e+ 1 ~ 
6 ~ Domp2e]. Now q = P2m is as required. 
Proof of Fact D: Let h be big enough, ]~ > (2x) +. < a well ordering of 
H(~), for which h is the first element. It suffices to prove that for any given 
countable N < <H(i~),e,<>, Q 9 N, p e g (~ Q there is q 9 G, (N,Q)-generic, 
p -- q. So let 6 = N C% ~I and choose a n < 6, such that a n < ~xn+ 1 , 6 = 
L.J an. 
Let Ibg :JZ < ~ be a list of all members of N /~ H(A) and N~ be the Skolem 
hull 
of 
iQ,pg{ t]lbg : g < k ! [J li:i < an] 
in 
the 
model 
Nt=Ntg(h) 
<(H(/~),9 
So 
clearly 
N~ e N 
(as 
A 
is 
definable 
in 
<H(~),e,<>, 
being the first, hence < H(A),e,<> belongs to N). It is also clear 
that 
tlNk =N t, so every predense ~)C Q,D9 
belongs to A n hence to 
some N k . 
Now define by induction on ~%,ID 
n such that: 
a)Po = P,Pn <--Pn+l 
b) p,~ c N,~ n Q 
c) if66S, 
thenpn, 
f~agreeonA~ 
c~Nn -Domp0 

161 
d) if s < n, a t an open dense subset of Q thenla n ~ a t 
e) a n < Dompn+l 
For n = 0, p 0 = P satisfies all the requirements. 
If Pn is defined and satisfies the requirements, 
first note that AS f~ Nn+ 1 is 
finite as Nn+ 1 c N, Sup (Nn+ 1 FI ol) c N hence Sup (Nn+ 1 f~ r 
< ~, whereas 
A~ has order type ~ with Sup(Aa) =~. 
By Fact C there ispn t->j0 n ,p~c 
Q, 
pt ~ f~ r (Nn+ 1 f~ A~ - DomP0 ) and by Fact B. w.l.o.g, a n C Dompn?. 
As Nn+ 1 ~ (H(A),c,<), Pn,Q c Nn+l, we can 
find such pn ? c Nn+ 1. 
Now p~* 
satisfies all the requirement 
on Pn+l except maybe d) for s = n. So if a n is an 
open dense subset of Q, we choose Pn+l c a~, Pn+l ->PIn, Pn+l ~ Nn+~, and if 
a n is not an open dense subset of Q, we choose Pn+~ = Pn ?- 
So we have carried the definition by induction of the Pn'S- Now q = 
U Pn 
is a member 
of Q: by a) , q is a function 
from an ordinal to ~; by b) 
Domp n C~, 
and 
by 
e) 
a n CDompn 
hence 
Domq =~; 
for 
~l<~, 
q rA~,=~e f~, as q tA,II~P~ c Q for some n and q rA~=a, f~by 
c). Also q 
belongs to every a t which is an open dense subset of Q (by d) aspe+l -- q). 
But every open dense subset of Q which belongs to N, belongs to H(h) (as ~, is 
big enough), hence to N? hence is a t for some g, so q is (N,Q)-generic. 
We can easily get similarly (more exactly, combining 1.7 and [Sh 74]): 
1.8 Conclusion: In the model from 1.6, if E = Ir 
- S], S ~ wl stationary 
costationary 
, the following holds: If G is an abelian group, G = 
U Gi , G~ 
<r 
increasing 
countable, 
free, Gi/G 1 free when j r S, j < i then G is a White- 
head group. 
Also note that if E is a normal filter on co 1, by E-complete 
filters we can 
"shoot" through 
all A ~ E closed unbounded 
subsets 
of o 1. We can in 1.7 

162 
(hence 1.8) replace ~1 -- S~, by a normal non trivial ideal on c01; which we can 
assume is dense in the sense that every stationary 
S C co 1 contains a subset 
in the ideal.

Proof: For g = 0, exactly as the proof of Theorem IIl 3.2, by induction 
on a. For g > 0 use Lemma 3.10 (from the next section) and Claim 2.4 below. 
Remark: There are examples that the notions are distinct, proper is 
([ SI4 (/~)I,0,0) -proper. Note that by Lemma 3.10 it follows that (E,a,g)-

w a- properness and (E,a)- properness revisited 
In w we gave some solution to "which forcing does not add reals". What 
occurs is that we may have a small stationary subset of cop on which e.g. uni- 
forrnization properties hold. But we want e.g. to be able to put a proof on the 
consistency of CH + SH, which is impossible by w 
method, because it is pos- 
sible that the model V, from Theorem 16 satisfies also 0 
o,, and even 0 ;,-s 
(see w or [Sh 80a]). 
Here we make an investment for this goal by developing a-properness 
(and (E,a)-properness) which is a generalization of properness, when the 
genericity is obtained for some tower of models simultaneously. In almost all 
cases the proof that properness holds gives a-properness. The point is that 
for many properties X, "X + a-properness "is preserved by CS iteration. 
To a large degree we redo here w 
with more explanation, but for ~ = 0 
only, for notational simplicity only. 
3.1 Definition: For a < ~1 the forcing notion P is said to be a-proper if 
for every sufficiently large ~ and for every sequence <N~ I i <- a> such that 
Ni is a countable set, N~ < H()k), if the sequence <g~ [ i -- a> is continuously 
increasing, i e N~, < N~. ] j ~ i> c N~+I,P c N O and p ~ P C~ g0, then there is 
a q, p ~ q c P which is (/V~,P)-generic for every i <- a. 
3.2 Remarks: (1) Obviously, a forcing notion P is 0-proper if and only if 
it is proper. 
(2). It is also obvious that if 16 < a and P is a-proper than P is 
also 16-proper (since every sequence <N i ] i -16> which satisfies the above 
conditions can be extended to a sequence < N, I i ~ a> which satisfies these 

165 
conditions and since P is a-proper 
there is a p <- q e P which is (N~,P)- 
generic for every i <-- a). Therefore, in particular, every a-proper P is proper. 
(3) If P is a-proper it is also a+ 
l+a 
proper. 
To see this let 
<a 
I i _- a + : + a>, p 
he as requ:red. 
Si.oe 
P is a-proper there is a q, 
p ~ q e P 
which is (N~,P)-generic for every i---a. 
Since Na+ 1 ~ H(A) and 
p,P, <N~ I i-::a> eNa+ 1 there is such a q eNa+ 1 . Since P is a-proper 
there is q , q-<q eP 
which is (Na+l+ ~,P)-generic for every i-a. 
Since 
q >. q,q is also (N~,p)-generic for every i <- a + i + a. 
(4) Note that if a is limit, < Ni:i < a> increasing and continuous, 
p is (Ni,P)-generic for i < a (and P 6 No) then p is (N,P)-generic where 
N=uN~ 
~<a 
As a consequence, if P is proper it is a-proper for all n < o and 
if P is ~-proper it is a -proper for all o ~ a < r 2.

The proof of this theorem is like the proof of the corresponding fact for 
proper forcing. 
3.5 Theorem: For each a < o 1, a -properness is preserved by countable 
support iteration. 
Again the proof is similar to the one on properness.

w Preservation of ~- properness + the co ~ - bounding property 
4.1 Definition: A forcing notion P has the ~0~-bounding property if for 
any f e (o~) rIG] (G c P generic) there is g 9 (r162 such that ~ -< g (i.e. 
(vn < ~)f (~) ~ g(M). 
4.2 Discussion: Clearly the ~J~-bounding property can be considered as 

170 
an approximation to the property "not adding reals". Also this property, and 
similar properties play crucial parts in many independence proofs. That is, 
many times we want on the one hand to add many reals, but on the other 
hand to preserve something, e.g. to preserve: the set of old (or constructible) 
reals is of the second category or does not have measure zero, or every new 
real belongs to an old Borel set of special kinds, etc. In the next chapter we 
shall deal with various such properties. But here we choose to deal with w ~- 
bounding, as it is very natural, and as the proof of its preservation is a proto- 
type to many other such proofs. To be more exact we do not prove that it is 
preserved, only that together with w-properness it is preserved. 
4.3 Theorem: The property "w-properness + the wV-bounding property 
"'is preserved by countable support iteration. 
Proof: Let <P~,Q I i < a> be an iterated forcing system. We prove that 
it has the w~-bounding property by induction on a (the preservation of w- 
properness follows from Theorem 3.5 ). For a = 0 there is nothing to prove. 
For a + 1 we have V pa§ 
pa)@~. Iff 9 V p=§ 
(V P=~I) Q~thenthereisafunc- 
tion g 9 V Pa such that g > f (since Q= has the w~-bounding property) and by 
the induction hypothesis there is an h 9 V such that h -> g, so h -> f. 
Now assume that a is a limit ordinal and cf(a) > ~0- Let f 6 V P" and let f 
be a Pa-name of f, and let q e Pa. Let N be a countable elementary submo- 
del of H(A) such that q,f,Pa e N, and let q ~ p 9 Pa be (N,Pa)-generic. For 
each ~z let ~gn be the set of all conditions in Pa which decide the value of 
.gn is dense in Pa and since it is definable from Pa it is in N. Therefore 
~gn C~ N is predense above p. The union of all the domains of the members of 
tJ (Sin FI N) (J ~p ~ is included in Pj for some j < a. Let ft be the Pj-name 
of a member of w ~ constructed so that if r E ~9~ holds (i.e. belong to G.) then 
~3 

171 
f t(n) has the value which r forces on f(n). Since ~qn D N is predense above 
p we have p 
II- f = ft. Therefore for every q c Pa there is a j < a, a Pfname 
.f?andap 
~qssuchthatp 
[~-f =ft 
Thus in V[Pa] f =ftforsome,j 
<a 
ft E: V[Py]. 
By the induction hypothesis there is a g c (~)v 
such that 
g~_.ft=f 
. 
We have really proved. 
4.4 Claim= If Q = <P~,Q :i < a t is a countable support iterated forcing 
notion, Pa = Lim Q, each Q. proper and a has cofinality > 1t o, then any real 
(or even co-sequence) added by Pa, is added by Pi for some "/ < a. 
So we are left with the case a is a limit ordinal of cofinality H 0, the follow- 
ing lemma is the main point.

Remarks: (1) Instead maximal antichains we can look at names of an 
ordinal, or dense subsets. 
(2) The situation for P,No,NI,r in the assumption is similar to 
the situation of P * Q, No,N 2, (r,ql) in the conclusion when ql > ~ql is (N2,Q) 
generic. So we preserve the situation not increasing the condition in P. So 
we advance one step in the iteration and lose genericity for one of the models 
(N1) and this will give us the induction step in the proof of 4.3 for cf a = t~ 0. 
Proof of Lemma: 
For helping us in understanding let G c P be generic over V, and we shall 
work sometimes in V[G] sometimes in V. Note that if r c G (which is the 
interesting case for us ) then Nr~[G] N H(A) V = gr and N~[G] ~ ~H(A)[G],e), 
which is always true. 
First try: 
As ~o is a maximal anLichain of P *Q, there is 090,q0 ) E~o, Po E G, 
V[G] ~ " qo[G],/[G] are compatible in gG] " Hence in V, there is a maximal 
antichain ~ 
~ P, ~o + = ~P,7:W c Yll (T1 C 1~/~), such that for each 7/c T 1 there 
is (5oO,!:) C J0, P ~pO ~p~, p. I~P " Iq,qO~~_~ is a compatible set (in ~Q) " (a 
compatible set means it has an upper bound). 
Similarly for each 7/c T1; there are pl _>p~, and (pl,ql) c~1, pl ->Pl, 
pl i~_p ..iq:,ql I is compatible 
" 
So there is T 2, T 2 C212 for some /~, 
~7 c T 2 ===>7/t 1E T 1 and for every ~71 c T 1 for some 7/2 , ~11 =772t 1, and 
~ 
= Ip~:7/ C T21 is a maximal antichain, p~-~p, rl, P~PI, 
(pl,q~) c fit, 
P~ I~-"lq:~ 1,q~7 r 21] is compatible in Q". 

173 
So we can easily define inductively on n 
Tn, Pn(rl 9 Tn),~+-1 and 
(for 
9 %). 
Looking at the way we have defined this, clearly we can assume T~, 
<P,/~7 e Tn> 9 N 0 
(i.e. 
the 
function 
n -* Pn 
inN0 
) 
and 
<(9~-1,q"-1):~ 9 T.> 9 N0, But as <3n:~% <ca> not necessarily belong to N O

<< T=,<pn,71 9 T~>, < (2~-'.q~-'):r/e 
T~>>:I---n <ca> belong to N,. 
Now as each ~9 
O is a maximal antichain of P, for some n(s 
<ca, 
=.~(s 
hence 3~(g) C 3n(~) N NO = J~ ('~ NO is predense above r and is 
finite. Let Tn=~e 
T n :pn e~(s 
So it is natural to look for ql 9 Q[G] 
(where r 9 G) such that for each s < ca, lqs149 
T~+ I I is predense above 
ql. This will be sufficient - it implies (in V[G]) ql is (N0,Q[G])-generic, ql ~ q, 
and in V, ~(P~,~):~7 9 T~+II is a finite subset of ~ f~ N O predense above 
(r,ql); moreover clearly we can choose ql 9 N2, in fact ql 9 NI. 
Unfortunately there is no reason to asssume q l exists. Look at the 
extreme case Tr~ = I~Tn]- (e.g. when P is t~ 1- complete and r 
determine 
G 
~N0). 
So 
in 
V[G] we 
know 
q, 
(s <ca) 
and 
we 
know 
~P 
q~+1 
s 
~q' q~+l : s < s 
is compatible for every s < ca; this is not a good reason to 
assume lq,q~+,:s < cal is compatible, except when Q is Ml-complete and any 
two compatible members have a least upper bound. 
Second Try: 
Let Js NN0 = ~(Pm~,q s

Now in V we have a P-name of it f 9 N 1 which r forces to be as above. As 
r 
is 
(N1,P)-generic 
we 
have 
just 
countably 
many 
candidates 
for 
f 9 (6)w)v N Ni, clearly there is in V a function f " e to ~ such that for every 
f 9 
\co~ f "~a, f" (i.e. |n <c0: not f (n) --< f "(n)| is finite). So it is rea- 
sonable to try ql = q ~ 
\/ 
q~ [G], (i.e. it is consistent. See in the begin- 
rn.cf "(~ )~rn. 
rn E S~[ a J

(If so we can use a suitable P-name for q 1)- 
Unfortunately though f ' is a very plausible candidate, the fact is that if

Third try: 
Here we shall rescue something from the first try to correct the second 
try. Using the first try notation (and what we prove). Remember ~" = .9~(g), 
and .9,~(~) is a 
finite 
subset 
of .gn(~)f~ No (predense 
above r). 
'~Let

Clearly <k(g):g < ~> 9 N1, and so in the second try w.l.o.g. ]c(g)< f *(g) 
for every g < co. 
Now return to the beginning of the argument in the second try. We know 
that 
for 
every 
qt e Q[G] Fl N0[G] 
there 
is 
f 9 (coo)v such 
that 
~ 
qt ^/k

q~ [G]

In 
particular 
for

The maximum

hence, it is a well defined natural number, so f+ 9 (~o)Y[G]. So there is in V

For each 7/e~

then

Continuation of the proof of the theorem 4.3. 
We were proving by induction on a that if [~p," Q is w-proper and has the 
w~ 
property ': Q = <P~,Q.:i < a> is a CS iteration then P, = Lim 
is w-proper and has the w~ 
property. The ~-properness follows by 
3.5, and for the w~-bounding property only the case of cfa = ~o was left. Now 
by lI 2.4(c) w.l.o.g, a = ~. Let f be a t='= -name p e P=, P ]~- "f 9 w~" and we 
have to findg e(w~ v, q,p--q 
9 
q [~-"f--g" 
We can assume 
w.l.o.g, that 
(*) f(n) is a Pn-name 
(this 
is included 
by the 
proof that 
P~ is proper 
see III 3.2 ). 
Let 
N~ <<H(A),e> 
(X big enough ) be an increasing 
chain such that, p, 
<Pn,Q :n < w> 9 No,N ~ 9 N~+ 1 each N~ countable (Note that N~ < N~+ 1 fol- 
lows from Ng e Ng+l, N§ countable, N~,N~+ 1 < < H(X),9 
We want to find q e P=, q _~ p, r ]l-p=

e(w o) v we now 
1) qn+l rn = qn, p rn <_ qn 
2) qn is (Nk,Pn)-generic for k = 0, and n+l -~ k < w 

177 
3) there is a function F n E Nn+ 1, whose domain is the set of max- 
imal antichains of P~ which belong to N 0, and for every .9 c Dom F n, F~(~) is 
a finite subset of .~ V~ No predense above r n. 
Clearly if we succeed then q = U qn E P... is as required. We can define 
g(n) as the minimal g(n), q,~ [[--" f(n)< g(n)"'g (n) exists by 3) and (*). 
For ~z =0 use the c0-properness of Q, and for n + 1 we use first the 
*'0 
lemma and then o-properness. 
w What forcing can we iterate without addding reals. 
In section 1 we have proved that we can iterate forcing notions of special 
kind (E-complete) without adding reals. As a result we get a parallel of MA for 
such forcings and get the consistency of some uniformization property. How- 
ever this union, quite strong in some respects, is consistent with diamond on 
S,: (see [Sh 77 ] [Sh 80a] . ) On some stationary subsets of col it can say much, 
but on others nothing. 
So we shall try here to find a property of forcing notions, so that forcing 
withLimQ 
, Q=<Pi,Q:i 
<a) 
a CS iteration of such forcing, does not add 
reals. 
5.1 Example: Assume 2 t% = ~1 (or even 2 t% < L ~t' suffice), 
Let A~ ~ ~ be unbounded of order type co, for B < o i limit, so by [DS] (or 
see XV w 
~A~:8 < col> does not have the uniformization property, hence 
there are ff6:A~-* 10,iI such that for no f:r 1 -~ [0,i], is f t A~ =a. ff~ for 
Let f = (I

178 
P)r = If:Dom f is an ordinal a < ~1, ~ ~ a ~ 
[f r A S =ae f#]l 
order by induction, 
D~ : If :i "C Dom f ,f 9 
So clearly there is no directed G c Py, G (~ De ~ ~ for every i. 
Remark: Previously Jensen and Johnsbraten show, that though forcing 
with Souslin trees does not add reals, but starting with V = L (at least with 
V = 
~ 
) there is a CS iteration of such forcing of length ~, such that forc- 
ing by the limit add reals. This however does not exclude a suitable MA as the 
example above. 
Now P is very nice forcing - e.g. it is a-proper for every a < ~1, but our 
desired property should exclude it. 
5.2 Definition: (1) We call [~ a completeness system if for some ~, ~ is a 
function 
defined 
on 
the 
set 
of 
triples 
( N,P,.p ), 
p c N C~ P,P c N, 
N < (H(h),c) 
N countable such that (P is meant here as a predicate on N, 
i.e., P • N): 
[~(iv,p,p) = I~(N,P,p) is a filter, or even a family of non-empty subset of 
Gen(N,P) = IG:G ~ N A P, G directed and G N .9 # ~b for any dense subset .9 
of P which belong to N] such that if G E Gen(N,P) belong to any member of 
[~(N,P,~) thenp E G. 
(2) We call ~ a k-completeness (h may also be finite or ~0) system 
if each family [~(N,PX) has the property that the intersection of any i ele- 
ments is non empty for i < 1 + h (so for k--> ~0, ~(N,Px) generates a filter ). 
Now such [~ can be naturally extended to include g ~ (H(~t),e) 
~ c N, 
/z < izt by [~(N,P@ ) = [~(N r~ H((~),P,p ). We do not distinguish strictly. 
(3) We say [~ is on/~. 
5.3 Definition: (I) Suppose P is a forcing notion, E a non trivial family 

179 
of subsets of SH0(/z) and ~ a completeness system. 
We say P is (E,[~)-complete if for every big enough ~k, if P, E,[~ c N, 
P ~ P C~ N, g < (H(A),E), 
g countable, A c E N N ~ 
g N Iz c A, then the 
following set belongs to [~(;v,P,p') (i.e., [~N (~ H(~),P,:~)): 
|G c Gen(N,P): p c G and t:here is an upper bound for G in Pt 
(2) If E = I SS0(/~)] we write just [~-complete. 
5.4 Remark: 
(1) We can think of [~(~,p,p> as a filter on directed subsets G of 
P N N generic over N, to which p belongs and the demand " (E,~)-complete 
" means that (for D(E) - majority of such N's ) the "majority" of such G's 
have an upper bound in P hence the name (E,~))-completeness. 
(2) In some sense the definitions above are trivial: if P is E- 
proper and does not add reals then there is a ~-completeness system [~ such 
that P is (E,[~)-complete for all z simultaneously. Because, given (N,P,p~, 
we extend p to q c P which is (N,P)-generic. 
If ~.~n:n < ~] is a list of the 
dense subsets of P which belong to N, ~ 
N N = IPn0~ :0 </r < r 
from which 
we can define a P-name x: 
x = |( n ,/r ~ :n < ~ and/r is !minimal such that :Pn,~ ~ G ] 
Clearly q I~-p"X c ~", 
and since P does not addreals there is x" c (v~)v, and 
r, 
q < r E P, 
r I~-p "X = x". 
Let 
Gr = ~Pt C P v~ N:pt < rl. 
Clearly 
G r c Gen(N,P) and let 
So what is the point of such a definition? We shall use almost always com- 
pleteness systems restricted in some sense: [~(N,PaD> is defined in a reason- 
ably simple way. The point is that usually when we want to decide whether 
some G E Gen(N,P) has an upper bound, we do not need to know the whole P, 

180 
but rather some subset of N, e.g. a function from N to itself. 
Check the 
example we discussed before: if ~ = N N ~1, then we just need to know f$. But 
two f~'s may give incompatible demands, so for it the system is a 1- 
completeness system. So if we deal with ~0-completeness system, we exclude 
it (in fact later we shall discuss even 3-completeness system ). 
The explication of "defined in a reasonably simple way" is: 
5.5 Definition: (1) A completeness system [~ is called simple if there is a 
first order formula 1# such that 
[~(N,P,p) = ~Az:x a finitory relation on N! 
where 
A~ = IG e Gen(N,P):< N tJ P(INI),e,.P,P,N> ~ lb[G,x]] 
(2) A completeness system li~ is called almost simple over V 0 (V 0 
a class, usually a subuniverse)if there is a first order formula @ such that 
~(N,P,p) = ~Ax,z:x a relation on N, z e V01 
where 
A,, z = |G c Gen(g,P):< V 0 LJ g tJ/9(N),c,p,P, V0,N > ~ @[G,x,z]] 
(3) If in (2) we omit z we call [~ simple over V 0. 
5.6 Claim-" (1) A k-completeness system is a k'-completeness system for 
every k ~ < k. 
(2) P is (E,~)-complete for some [~ if and only if P is E-proper 
and (forcing wiLh P) does not add new reals. 
Proof: (1) Trivial. 
(2) The direction <== (i.e. 
above. So let us prove the "only if" part. 
"if" ) was proved in Remark 5.4(2) 
So P is (E,[~)-complete. 

181 
Suppose 
N ~ r H(k),e), 
p c P, 
p ,P,E,[~, 9 N, 
N

So 
B=IG 9

hence B ~  
(by Definition 5.2) and let G 9 
So G has 
an upper bound q (by the definition of (E,[~)-completeness), G 9 Gen(N,P), 
and

Definition 
5.3 
too, 
p 9 G. 
So 
q ~p 
is 
(N,P)-generic. 
As 
p ]~-p"f 9 
f 9 
then for every n, -gn = i r 9 
]~-"f(n) =k '" for 
some ]r < c01 is a dense subset of P which belong to N, hence .gn N G ~ #. 
Hence q determines the value of f(n). So q determines f(n) for every n. 
Hence it determines f, i.e. f is not a new real. 
5.7 Example: Forcing by a Souslin tree T is not [~-complete for any sim- 
ple 2-completeness system ~. 
Let N ~ CH(},),E~ be countable, T E N, 6 = N ('1 w 1. Note that Gen(N,P) 
consist 
of 
the 
branches 
of 
T ~ N 
which 
has 
an 
upper 
bound, 
i.e. 
As = tY e T:y < xl, where x c Ta= the&thlevelof 
T. NowN"donotknow" 
what is the set of such branches of T (5 N, and two disjoint sets are possible. 
The above is an argument, not a proof. To be exact, we can, assuming 
diamond of Sl , build a Souslin tree, such that no first order formula lh define 
a simple 2-completeness system for which T is G-complete. 
w Speciali~ag an Aronszajn tree without adding reals. 
The traditional tests for generalizing MA has been Souslin Hypothesis. 
Jensen has proved the consistency of the Souslin Hypothesis with G.C.H. (see 
Devlin and Johnsbraten [DJ]) He iterates forcing notions of Souslin trees, in 
limit points of cofinality ~0 he uses diamond to refine the inverse limit of the 
trees, in limit points of cofinality ~t he uses the square on ~2 (and prepara- 
tory measures in previous steps). In successor stages he specializes a specific 
tree, by first forcing closed unbounded set and then building Souslin tree 

182 
using ~ 
(more exactly he adds 82 closed unbounded subsets in the begin- 
1 
ning). 
We shall prove that there is a Q-complete forcing notion Pr specializing 
an Aronszajn tree T, for Q a simple 81-completeness system. The proof is 
close to Jensen's successor stage. 
Notation: For an Sl-tree 
T, T~ is the i-th level, T t i = U Ti, and for 
z 9 Tl~, a~fl,

9 T=,y ~z. 
6.1 Theorerm There is an ~l-completeness system Q, such that for every 
Aronszajn tree T, there is a Q-complete forcing notion Pr, specializing it, i.e. 
I~-er " T is a special Aronszajn tree, '" also PT is a-proper for every countable 
ordinal a. 
Proof: 
First Approximation:

Let P = If :f a function from T r (atl)

Clearly Pr specialize T, but we have to prove that it is proper and does 
0 
not add reals. Let N < < H(~),e> , T, 
P 
e N, N ~ co 1 = ~, (N countable). Let 
r 
(the $-th level of T be) 
T~ = ~x~:n < col. It is trivial that we can extend any 
condition to a condition of arbitrarily large height. So we have to define an 
0 
increasing sequence of conditions p~ c 
P 
A N, which will be generic for N 
(henee their heights converge to ~) and has an upper bound. Now in order 

183 
that ~Pn:~ < ~ has an upper bound, it is necessary that for each s < co, the 
sequence (of rationals) ~pn(zcztht(pn)):n 
< co> is bounded. So a natural 
condition to ensure it is e.g. 
(*) for s < n, pn(zfZ t ht (pn) ) + 1/2 n > pn+l(zs t ht(pn+t) ) 
This is not difficult by itself, but we have also to ensure the genericity of 
:n < co>. So it clearly suffices to prove

Unfortunately we see no reason for (**) to hold.

Explanation: So we shall change somewhat 
P 
by adding "promises" 
T 
such that if (the parallel to) (**) fail, then we can add one more promise to p 
guaranteeing that p has no extension in D, contradiction to D being open 
and dense. 
Actual Proof 
6.2 Definition: We call F a promise (more exactly a T-promise) if there 
are a closed unbounded subset C of co 1 and n < r 
(denoted by C(F),n(F)) 
such that: 
a) the members of F are n-tuples ~ x o .....

which are 
pairwise 
disjoint 
(i.e. 
the 
ranges 
of the 
sequences are disjoint). 

184 
6.3 Definition: We let 
P1 = [(f,C):C is a characteristic function of a closed bounded subset of 
~x, with the last element r 
, and f 
is a monotonic increasing function 
from U Tr to 0]. 
(fl,C1) < (fz,C2)

only 
if 
C 1 ~ C 2 
(equivalently 
C 1 = C2t(gt(C1) + 1)) andfl 
C f2. 
6.4 Definition: We say that (f,C) E P1 fulfills or satisfies a promise r if: 
c(I') ~ C-MinC(F) 
and for every a <p 
in C(F) N C and 
g CFNn(Ta) 
(where n = n(F)) the following holds: 
(]) for every v > 0 there are infinitely many pairwise disjoint ~ ~: F FI '~(T 0) 
such that f (zg) < f (yg) < f (z~.) + ~ for g < ~z. 
6.5 The Main Definition: P = PT = I(f,C,~I,): (f,C)cP1, 
and ~I" is a 
countable set of promises which (f, C) fulfills {

N C(F) is a closed unbounded subset of ~1 (as 9 is

We define Cq = Cp I.)[fl~ (with domain #g+ 1)

to define just fq r Tp. We have on it two demands in order that q c P:

If we succeed to define fq t T#~ such that if satisfies i), ii) then q is well

Now ii) consists of countably many demands on the existence of infinitely

(F,y,~), 
F c ~I,p, ~ ~ r CI n(r)(TT), 7 < fl, T c Cp N c(r), each appearing infinitely often 
(if this family is empty, we have no work at all). 
We now define by induction on m, a function fm such that: 
a) fm 
is a function

a 
finite 
subset 
of

that 
f ~(x r a) < fro(x) for x e Dora Ff m.

and 
for 
every 
g < n (F m) (which is the length of era) fp (x~) <fm (Y ~) < fp (x~) + 1/m. 
This will be enough , as any triple appears infinitely often and 1/rn 
con- 
verge to zero, so any completion of tJfm to a function from Ta to 0 satisfying 
m 
i) is as required. 

186 
We let f0 be arbitrary satisfying a), e.g. the empty function. 
If fm is defined, let n =n(F), if Tm =a 
we know that F is a promise, 
7m c C(F), 
(part 
of 
requirements 
of (Fro,Tin,era)) and 
/~ 
C(F) 
by a 
hypothesis of Fact 6.6(2)). Hence (by the definition of a promise) there are 
infinitely many pairwise disjoint if's, ern < if, ?7 E F N n(Tp) . As the domain of 
fm is finite there is such ff disjoint to Dom fro" So we let: 
Dom f m+l = Dora f m U lYo ..... Yr~-ll

If 7m < a, we use the fact that (fp,C~)cP 1, satisfies the promise F,

a r C(I~ 
(by 
Definition

C(F) ~ Cp-Min C(F)

So 
there

Now we apply the argument above replacing ~rn by

define

in the

Proof: (1) By (2), using B e = lyc

(2) Suppose p,N,~,.8 0 .....

Let r I = I•: for some T~:pma,

there is no q e P, g _~p s

So I" 1 is, in a sense, the set of "bad" ~]'s; the places to which we cannot

then q exemplifies Io, N, ~, B 0 ..... 
Hn_ 1 do not form a counterexample, (for 
P = 7, z~ = B~ r p) except that maybe q ~ N. 
Now F 1 is definable in H(A) using parameters which are in N, hence 
F 1 9 N. Now the requirements on q are also first order with parameters in N, 
so w.l.o.g, q 9 N and we get the contradiction.

Otherwise let for i <j <~1 let ~J cF 2 ~n(Tj),

So for

Just by induction on n, d) and c). 
Now we prove the subfact itself. For any 77 c F 2 there are (by e)) Jm(Y) 
(m < co) such that there are m pairwise disjoint members of F 2 N m(Ti,(y ))

this holds for anyj >-jm(y). Now ifj ~- U Jm(?7) then

we can find for every m, m pairwise disjoint members of Y 2 U n(Tj) which are

members 
are 
pairwise 
disjoint. 
If i 0 < w , choose 
another

Let

i > a, 
i c C 1 
implies

and

It is easy to check C* is as required. 
So we finish the proof of 6.7. 
Continuation of the proof of 6.1: Triv~ al. 
w Iteration of (E,[~)- complete forcing notions 

190 
The discussion in the two previous sections lack a crucial point that we 
can iterate such forcing notions without adding reals. In order to get a rea- 
sonable axiom we need to iterate up to some regular ~ > 1~1 and have the ~- 
c.c. For ~ = l~ 2, Lemma 1.5 does not suffice as [ Pr] = 1~2 (from Theorem 6.2 ) 
but meanwhile ~ strongly inaccessible will suffice (see VII w 
or VII w 
An 
aesthetic drawback of the proof is that we do not prove that the forcing we 
get by the iteration enjoy the same property we require from the individual 
forcing notions. 
7.1 Theorem: Let Q = <P~,Q.:i < a> be a countable support iteration, 
H% 
Pa = Lim 0 
; E a non trivial family of subsets of 
Sbl0(N). 
(1) If each Q. is a-proper for every a < ol, and (E,~)-complete 
for some simple Ill-completeness system then Pa does not add reals. 
(2) We can replace in (1) "simple" by "almost simple over V" 
(note V and not VP'). 
Combining the ideas of the proofs of 7.1 and of 4.3 we can prove 
7.2 Theorem: In Theorem 7.1 we can weaken '~l-completeness 
system " 
to "I~0-completeness system " 
However we shall not prove it now. 
Proof of Theorem 7.1: 
For clarity of presentation 
we first deal with the case a = ~ (for a < 
there is nothing to prove). 
Let N~ < <H(A),e> 
be countable ( for i < r 
[~, Q e N 0, N~ e N(+ l (hence 
N( < N(+I) each N( is suitable for E and p e P~ N No and f e N o be a Po-name 
of a real. 

191 
Now we shall define by induction on n < ~ conditions r~,pn such that: 
A) (1) r~ ~ P~, r~ : r~+l r n 
(2) r~ is (N~,Pn)-generic for i = 0 and n+l < i < ~0. 
B) (1 / There is G~ 9 Gen (No,Pn) which is bounded by r~ and 
belong to Nn+ 1. 
(2) 
pn<-p,~+l, pn EP~No, 
po=p 
and pr, tn~--~'~ 
equivalently (Pn t n) E G,~. 
(3) Let I.~m:n < ml be a list of the open dense subsets of P~ 
which belong to No; then Pn+l c .~. 
Let us carry the induction. 
n= 0 Trivial (here we need only m-properness and that 
complete) 
Q0 is (E,~)- 
r~ + 1 We shall first define Pn+I then G~+ 1 and at last rn+ 1. 
First step : 
We want to find Pn§ E P~ N No, Pn+l -~Pn, Pn+l r n c G~ Pn+l c .~n. As 
.~n c P~ 
is 
dense, 
.~ E N 0, 
above 
every 
q E P~ N No 
there 
is 
r 9 
C~N0 N-~n,r--~q. Letfin =1 r 9 
~149 
~149 
v ~ t r~ = r], 
clearly 
it 
is 
dense 
above 
Pn t n, 
(in 
Pn). 
But 
pn r n e G~ 9 Gen (g0,Pn),and -~n 9 No, hence there is r 9 G~ N fin, and so 
there is r*EP~, r~ 
r ~ 
r~ 
=r. 
So clearly r* is thepn+l 
we 
need. 
Second step: 
Let G~ C Pn be generic over V, rn E Gn (hence G~ ~ Gn) and we shall try 
to see what are the demands on G~+ 1. Really we want in V[Gn], to find a 
member of Gen (No, Q [Gn] ) which has an upper bound. 
N~ 

192 
Note that ~n is a Pn-name which belongs to No. So also there is a pn- 
name # 
for the ~b appearing in the definition of simplicity, and it belongs to 
N 0. As we know Gn N NO = G,[, we "know" @n = # [Gn]. So we know that for 
some Ax,y (x a relation on No, y 9 V, see Definition 5.5) every G e Az, y has an 
upper bound (in Q [Gn] ), where 
Az,y = IG 6 Gen (No[G.], Q [G,~]): 
< v u N0[C~] u P(N0[C~]) V(c~'') 
So we have Pn-names x,y for z and y. 
Now z,y are quite unlikely to be in N o (as their definitions used N o as a 
parameter 
) 
but 
they 
can 
be 
chosen 
in 
Nn+l[Gn] 
(remember 
Nn+l[Gn] ~ <H(h)[Gn],e > 
as 
r,z e a n, 
r n 
is 
(Nn+l,Pn)-generic, 
and 
N0[Gn] 9 Nn+l[an]). 
Moreover, though we need to know a n to be able to find their exact values 
, we know that they are in V (remember p(N[a n]) e V and Pn does not add 
reals). 
So as r n is (Nn+l,Pn)-generic 
r,~ [b "" z,y 9 Nn+ 1 ", so we have just count- 
N 
ably many 
possible pairs 
(those in Nn+l). 
Now Nn+ 1 "think" there 
are 
uncountably many possibilities, but as Nn+ 1 9 Nn+ 2, Nn+ a ~ " 
Nn+ 1 is count- 
able,'; in Nn+ 2 we "know" that N[Az,y:x,y e Nn+l] is non empty (remember 
G~ 9 Nn+ I hence g0[G~ ~ e Nn+l). So in Nn+ z there is G n C Q [Gn] N N0[G,~] 
~n 
which belong to the intersection. So though we do not know exactly who will 
be x and y , we know (as long asr 9 G )) that G ~ 9 
. 
easily 
compute 
G~+ 1 9 Gen (No,Pn+I), 
-- I<qo,% 
..... 
..... 
From G ,Gi we can 
G~+I NP~ =Gn, 
q 
9 N O 
and 
Third step: 

193 
We now have to define rn+ 1 6 Pn§ 
so as we require rn+ 1 t n = rn, we just 
have to define r,~+l(n ). What are the requirements 
from it? looking at the 
induction demand, just: 
r IF . " r.+ICn) is above all members of G[ and is 
gen- 
eric forn 
+r <_i <c0" 
and there is no problem in this. 
We have finished the proof of 7.1 for a = co. 
Now we have to turn to the general case i.e. with no restriction on a. 
Let 
p,Q 9 N O < <H(A),9 ,N O 
be 
countable, 
P 9 Pa. 
Let 
No C~(a+ 1) = [fl~:i_7J, i<j 
===>fli<flj (so N O C~(a+ 1) has order type 
7)- 
Now (a + 1) we 
can 
find N~ < <H(A),e> 
for i-<7, 
N~ countable 
, 
<Ni: j <-- i> 9 N~+ 1 (just define by induction on i) and let N 6 = U N~ for ~ <- 7. 
s 
As N 09 
1,7+ 1 cNlhencei 
eN i. 
7.3 Definition: A pair (r,G) is called an ith approximation if: 
1) r 9 P#~ and r is (Nj,Ps,) generic for j = 0 and i + 1 -< 2" <- 7- 
2) G 9 Gen (No,P~,), and G is bounded by r and G 9 N~+ 1. 
Now it suffices to prove 
7.4 Claim= If 0~i 
<j--<7, (r,G) an ith approximation, p 9 Pp~ (~ No, 
p rfli 9 G then there 
is a jth 
approximation 
(r?,G t) such 
that p 9 G t, 
rtFfl~ =r andGt 
NP~, = G. 
Why is the claim sufficient? Just use i =0, 2" =7 (so ~=a) 
and we get 

194 
what we need. 
Now the proof of the claim is by induction on j (for all i), Then for suc- 
cessor this is just like the induction step for a = ~ and for limit j we diago- 
nalize using the induction hypothesis (taking care of also 1) of Definition 7.3. 

VI P-POINTS AND PRESERVATION THEOREMS 
w 1 A general preservation theoremu 
An important part of many independence proofs using iterated forcing, is 
to show that some property X is preserved (if satisfied by each iterand). We 
have dealt with such a problem (the ~-bounding 
property) and similar proofs 
can be worked out for several other examples. We give here a general context 
which serves for many examples (but unfortunately 
not for "adding no 
reals"). 
In fact there is more in common between the examples discussed 
later even than expressed by the stricter context suggested here (fine cover- 
ing model) (i.e., the use of trees T, T (~ no0 finite )but the saving will be 
minimal. 
For applications it suffices to read Definition 1.1, 1.2 (the fine covering 
model) and Corollary 1.7 (on preservation). 
1.1. Definition: We call (D,R) a weak covering model (in If) if 
a)D a set, R a two place relation on it, zRT implies T is a closed subtree 
of ~>~(i.e., < > c T, T closed under initial segments, and above any 7/c T 
there are arbitrarily large members of T ), let Lim T = [~7 E ~:r/r k c T for 
every k < ~| 
b) for every ~/~ ~eo and z c DomR (=|x:(:IT)zRT]) there is T c D such 
that xRT and T/c Lim T 
Re~rn~rk: The intuitive meaning is: zRT means T is a closed tree of 
"size" at most x. In Definition 1.2, which exploit more of our intuition, we 
have an order on the set of possible x's, x < y with the intuitive meaning "x 
is a smaller size than y % So it would be natural to demand: 
zRT, x < y ~ 
yRT 
zRT, Ttc T ==~ zRTt 

196 
However, no need arises. Note also that sometimes x appear trivially (like 
UF(F) in w and the ~O-bounding model in w 
1.2 Definition: (1) A fine covering model is (D,R,<) such that 
(a) (D,R) is a weak covering model 
(~)< is a partial order on Dom R, such that 
(i) (u 
e Dora R)(.~x e Dom R)(x < y) 
(ii)(vy,= 
e Dora 
< y 
= < 
< y) 
(7) Ifx >xt>yn+l 
>yn forn <~and 
T ncD, 
yn R T n (forn c~)then 
there is T*cD, xRT ~ 
o <n 1 <n 2 <.-.<c0suchthat 
Lim T*~:foreveryi 
<w, ~Trn/ c U T/] 
(6) condition (7) continues to hold in any generic extension in which a) 
holds, 
(2) For a property X of forcing notions, (D,R,<) is a fine covering 
model for X-forcing if Definition 1.2(1) holds when we restrict ourselves in (6) 
to X-forcing notions only. 
1.2J~ Remark: 1) In an abuse of notation we do not always distinguish 
between (D,R,<) and (D,R). 
(2) Look carefully at (6), it is in a sense, meta-mathematical. 
(3) Note that if y <x, yRT then for some T ~ TC T ~ 
(4) So if (D,R,<) is a fine covering model. P a (D,R) -preserving 
forcing notion [see Definition 1.4(1)] then in V P (D,R,<) is still a fine covering 
model. 
1.2B Convention: If the 
order 
< is not specified it is x < y 
iff 
x,y E ~co, x(n ) <- y(n ) for every n and y(n )l x(n ) diverge to ~.

1.4 Definition: 1) Let (D,R) be a weak covering model. We say that a 
forcing notion P preserves (D,R) or is (D,R)-preserving if ]]-p"(D,R) is a 
weak covering model ". 
2) Let K be a property of covering models. We say that a forcing 
notion P is K-preserving if for any (D,R) e V satisfying K, P preserves (D,R). 
3) We call a covering model (D,R) smooth if for any (D,R)- 
preserving forcing notion P, ][-p"(D,R) is a covering model ". 
4) We call a strong covering model (D,R) strongly smooth if for 
any (D,R)-preserving forcing notion P,]]-p"(D,R) is a strong covering model 
,,. 
1.5 Claim= If (D,R,<) is a fine covering model then (D,R) is a strongly 
smooth strong covering model. 
Proof: We have to check conditions c),d) of Definition 1.3 in order to 
prove (D,R) is a strong covering model 
c) It suffices to prove that x < y -----> (D,R) ~ ~ais(z,y). 
So suppose T e D, xRT and F is a function from D • co to Rang R, such that 

198 
(Yn)(Yx ~ Dom R)[z R F (x,n)] 
So 
let, 
by 
(fl) 
of 
Definition 
1.2 
yt,xr,(n < to) 
be 
such 
that 
y >y?>xn+~>xn 
>..->x 
0=x, 
let 
z~=xg 
and 
To = T, T~+ l=F(xn,r~). 
Now apply condition (~,) of Definition 1.2 to get T ~ n o < nt< -. - such that 
T* D [~/: for every/ 
< to, ~/tn~ ~ U Tj~. 
Now T" is as required in 1.3(1): 
We have to prove that

Clearly (i) holds: 
~E T,g <taz::~vltn s E T= ToE uTj.

For (ii) suppose ~/t~/e E T, 7/c F(ze,s

If g +1<i 
then 
j-*:i

if

of 
c) 
above 
(D,R) ~ ~bdis(x~,mn§ 
So 
we 
have 
to 
prove 
only 
(D,R) ~d~s(<Xrt,xn+l,xn+l,'''~,xn+2), 
so 
let 
Tg 
be

of Definition 
1.2 there 
are y'f,yn(n < to) such 
that 
xrt+l<Yo<Yl<'''<Yr, 
<Yn+i<''" <yt<xn+2" 
By remark 
1.2A (3) there 
are T~,Tt~C T~,ygR 
T~. So by (9') of Definition 1.2 there are n 0<n 1 <--- 
and T*,zRT ~ and T* D Iv/: for every g,~7 t ng e: U T]}, hence clearly T" 3 117: 
for 
every 
g,r/tn

So 
T 
is 
as 
required, 
we 
have 
proved 
(D,R) ~ q/ais(<X,~,xn§ 
. . . > ,z) hence finish to prove d). 

199 
Now why is (D,R) strongly smooth? By remark 1.2A (4). Suppose P is 
(D,R)-preserving then is V P (D,R) is still a weak covering model as P is 
(D,R)-preserving, hence (a) of Definition 1.2 holds in V P, (~) is trivial, and (T), 
(6) hold by (6). So (D,R,<) is a fine covering model in V P. 
1.6 Theorem: Suppose (D,R) is a smooth strong covering model, 
Q=<P~,Q:i <6> 
a countable support iteration of (e~,l)-proper forcing 
notions, each P~ is (D,R) -preserving for i < ~, and 6 is a limit ordinal. (Recall

Then P8 = Lim Q is (D,R) -preserving. 
1.7 Corollary: if ~ = < P~Q :i < a> is a countable support iteration, 
(D,R,<) a fine covering model and each q. is (~,l)-proper and (D,R,<)- 
preserving, then so is Lim Q. 
Proof: By 1.6, 1.5 . (1.5 takes care of the induction for successor ordi- 
nals). 
Proof of Theorem 1.6: As each Q. is proper (by V 2.1 as it is (~,I)- 
N$ 
proper) by III 3.2, w.l.o.g. 6 = cf 6; and by V 4.4. if cf 6 > ~0 then each real in 
YP* belong to some VP~,i < 6, so the conclusion is trivial. So we can assume

There is no problem for n = 0,1. 
So we have just to do the induction step . Assume r n, T n are defined, and 
we shall define r n+t, Tn+ 1. 
Let G n E Pn be generic over V, r n 9 Gn, so je

f

Let T t 
Fo(q,z), qt = F2(q,z). 
By our hypothesis 
(smoothness) 
in V[Gn] 
(D,R) is still a covering model. 
So now we apply condition c) of Definition 1.3(2) (the definition of a cov- 
ering model) as ~a~(x2m,X2m+1 ) for the tree T n and the function F, (which is 
from DomRxca 
to D) F(z,m) =Fo(qnm,z), so we get a tree T ~ T n C T* as 
described there. Working in Vwe have a Pn-name T* , let for s c Pn, T*(s) be 

202 
the unique T such that s []- "'T* = T'" if it exists. Hence for an open dense 
subset .9 of Pn, T~ 
is defined for t e .~. Clearly the function T~ 
belong 
to N 1 (more exactly such functions belong to N1) and also ~e N 1. If r ~ 
belong to the generic subset of P~, then some t e .9 N Ns-+2- belong to it by 
condition a) above. 
Let

the

(D,R) I[-~b~(<zan,x2~+l,x2n+v... >,zan+a);

As we can assume w.l.o.g, that Q is closed under countable disjunction we

that

So we finish the induction step, hence the proof.

w Three known properties 
In this section we use the machinery from the previous section. We deal 
with three properties which we call: ~-bounding 
property, Sacks property 
and Laver property. All have been used, and we show that their preservation 
by countable support iteration follows from 1.7. We then present the "classi- 
cal" examples of such forcing. In the next section we shall deal with one 
example in much more detail. 
Notation: DP(~ 
= Ix E ~:z(n) 
~ 1 for every n 
and (z(n):n < aJ) 
diverge 
to 
infinity, 
i.e. 
for 
every 
m <~ 
for 
some 
]c < ~, 
for 
every 
n >h:,z(n)~.m.| 
2.1 Definition: 1) We call (D,R) an w~-bounding model if 
a) For some subuniverse Vt (with the same ~1) ]9 = H(R1) ~ 
b) xRT iff z,T ~_ D,z c DP(~e~), T ~ ~>~ a closed tree and (Vn)(T N n~ is 
finite) (so z has really no role) 
c) it covers se~ i.e:, 
(V~? e =~)(Yz c DP(WaO N D)(:~T e D)[zRT ^ ~? e Lira T] 
2) The family of e~ ~ -bounding models will be denoted by 
K~,(D,R) is the full model if D = H(lr 
(so it is unique ) and its R is denoted 
by R~. 
2.2 Claim: Any coS-bounding model is a fine covering model. 
Proof: Let us check the conditions in Definition 1.2. 
a) a) Trivial by a),b) of Definition 2.1. 
b) Part c) of Definition 2. I is a restatement of b) 
~) Trivial (remember Convention 1.2B) 
T) Follows from ~ ) (for the trivial extension) 
~) Let z > z t > y~ > Yn,Y~ R Tn, but the sequence (yn,Tr,:n < ~ 
is in 

204 
V[G] in which (D,R) is still a weak covering model. Let n k = k, 
T ~ = |y: for every k < =, ~/r/c c U Tj.J 
j~k 
T" is as required except that there is no reason why T* 9 D. 
Now we use Fact 1.9, applied to T', (i.e to the branch of TTR which T" 
induced.) 
So there is a closed tree Cc TTR,c9 
and for every ~, 
T" V~ ~>~ ~ C Let 
T" = [I/ 9 =>e: for some t cO, z/9 
Clearly T ~176 
c D ( as C9 D,D = H(t~1) v~ for some Tit), T'" is a closed tree 
c =>e, and T ~ c T**. in addition, for every n 
T** C~ ~ 
= LJ It Ut ~co:t 9 
TTt~§ 
so, being a finite union of finite sets, T'* ~ ne is finite. 
2.3 Claim: I) A forcing is (D,R)-preserving for some r 
model 
iff it is (D,R) preserving for all c0=-bounding models 
2) A forcing notion is (D,R)-preserving for some c~-bounding 
model ifJ' it has the wW-bounding property (see Definition V 4.1 ). 
Proof: Easy. 
2.4 Conclusion: The "ee-bounding property 
+ (~,l)-properness 
" is 
preserved by countable support iteration. 
Z.~ Definition: 1) We call (D,R) a Sacks model if: 
a) For some subuniverse V t with the same #I,D = H(Rt) ~ 
b) 
z R T 
~ff 
x,T9 
and 
z cDP(~'~),Tc~>r 
and 
for 
every 
n < ~,T (~ ~ 
has at most z(n) elements. 
c) It covers, i.e., 
(v~ 9 ~)(v= 9 DP(~) n D)(~7 c D)[= R T ^ n e ~m T] 
2) The class of Sacks models is Ksc,(D,R) is the full Sacks model 

205 
if D = H(l~z), and then we denote R by Rsc. We say P has the Sacks property if 
it is K~ -preserving. 
2.{} Clairo= Any Sacks model is a fine covering model. 
Proof: Let us check the conditions in Definition 1.2. 
(a) a) Trivial by a), b) of Definition 2.5. 
b) Part c) of Definition 2.1 is a restatement of it. 
(~) Trivial, by the definition of the partial order. 
(7) Let z > xt > Y~+2 > Y~,Y~ R T~ (for n < ~). 
Define nk as the first m <~ 
such that for every ~, m-E 
<a, 
and 
~ k,y~(E)/xt(~) is ~ 1/(/c+2), define T ~ as in the proof of (6). 
(~) Let V[G] be a generic extension of V (in which (D,R) is still a weak 
covering model). 
We can find in it ~z 0 < n z <.. such that: 
T~ 
To U I~?: for every/W r n~ c ITj:j ~;i]l 
is a suitable tree (i.e., (u 
IT" F~ ~J < xt(n)) but there is no reason why 
T'E D. 
However, because even in V[G] (D,R) is a weak covering model, 
there 
is (by 1.9) A closed tree g~ TTR in D, 
T* ~n~ 
EL 
zRa where 
z(•) 
= x(r~)/xt(~r~). LeLC1 = {t cr for every n, I~ C~ ~] 
~ at(m)] and r be 
the maximal closed tree 
~ C1. Clearly Ca E D and T" N n~ c C2 for every n, 
now 
T"= U|t :t c e2] c D 
is as required. 
2.7 Clairm A forcing notion is (D,R)-preserving for some Sacks model iff 
it is Ks c -preserving. 
Proof: Easy (really the same as the proof of (6) in 2.61. 

206 
B.8 Conclusion: The "Sacks property 
+ (:9,1)-properness" is preserved 
by countable support iteration. 
Proof: By 1.7 and the previous claims. 
2.9 Definition: 1) We call (D,R,<) a Laver model if 
a) For some subuniverse Vt (with the same t~l) D = H(t~i)v 
b) x R T if]' (x,T 9 D)z 9 DP(~':9), T c ~>:9 a closed tree and (Y~z) [the 
set 1~7(n):7/9 T,g (~7) = •+1, (Yi < n)~?(n) < x(2n)] has power < z(2*z+l)~. 
c) (V ~ 9 ":9)(Vz 9 DP(~:9) (~ D)(~T 9 D)(z R T ^ ~ eLim T) 
d) x <y iff <z(2~z+l):~% <:9> <<y(2~z+l):~% <:9>. (see 1.2 B) and 
<:9> = 
<:9> 
2) The class of such models we call K/~ and having the Laver pro- 
perty means being KLv -preserving . The full Laver model is when we take 
V t = V, and denote the appropriate R by R/~. 
2.10 Claim: Any Laver model is a fine covering model. 
Proof: The proof of (a) , (6) is totally trivial and (7) follows from (~), so 
we shall prove (~) only. 
So let V[G] be a generic extension of Y in which (D,R) is still a weak cov- 
ering model. 
Let x > z? > Yn+l > Yn, Tn, be given and y,~ R T~. 
We can choose n 0<n 1 <n 2<--. 
(by induction) such that: for /r ~*zs 
~,, 
y~(2k+l) < zt(2k+l), and let 
r162 
T" = To U 17/: for every i,71 F n~ c U T~- ] 
To = [~7 9 ~>:~ for every i < s (n),~/(i) < x(2i)J 

207 
Clearly 
T ~ ~ ~ 
is 
a 
closed 
tree, 
and 
for 
any 
/c, 
ITO n T" nk~l ~ z,(2k+~), 
because, 
letting 
ns162 <~z~+ 1,

.f <e~+l 
So T" is almost as required; even the definition of ztRT" is satisfied, but 
maybe T~ 
D or even T~ 
V. So we again use 1.9; define z ~ DP(~) 
by: 
z(Rk)=RX(2~),z(gk+l)=[z(2k+l)/zt(2k+l)]. 
We can choose an isomor- 
phism between the trees TTR and ~ 
such that: if t E TTR, 
(u165 
<s 
then the image of t 
is in lue~ 
So in D there is a tree C c TTR such that: 
a) t EC~t

b) Ion ~,l ~ z(z~+l) 
c) T O N T~ f~ k~ E cfor every ]r 
Let Cl = |t e C for every k, I t (~ ~ ~ I < zt(2]c +1) ] and s ~ Ci be a maximal 
closed tree, and 
T ~ = ~/E '~>r ff 1,/c T o then ~/E U It:t cC2]~ 
T ~ is as required. 
2.11 Claim: P is preserving for the full Laver model iff P has the Laver 
property. 
Proof: Easy. 
2.12 Conclusion: The Laver property is preserved by countable support 
iteration. 
2.13 Claim: A forcing notion P has the Sacks property iff it has the ~o_ 
bounding property and the Laver property. 
Proof: Easy. 

208 
2.14 Lemma: 1) "Random real" forcing has the co ~ -bounding property, 
(remember it is forcing by ~A :A C R a Borel set of positive measure ], ordered 
by inverse inclusion). 
2) Sacks forcing has the Sacks property, where Sacks forcing is 
the set of perfect T C ~>~ ordered by inverse inclusion. 
3) Laver forcing has the Laver property where it is ~ T K ~>o:T a 
perfect 
tree, 
and 
for 
some 
k, 
n < k ==~ I T CI nol = 1, 
and 
[,z ;e ~ ,~'1 c T N ~ 
::::~i:~^~ i~ c T] is infinite]. 
All three forcing notions are a-proper for every a. 
Proof: Left to the reader, as it is (essentially) well known and will not be 
used. 
2.15 Definition: An ultrafilter F on ~ is called a Ramsey ultrafilter if for 
any partition ~An:n <r 
of ~ (i.e., A n C~Am =0, for n #m 
and c0= UA-n) 
*z<r 
either for some n, A~ eF or for some A eF, 
I A /~An] ": 1 for every•. 
Of 
course we are demanding that no finite set belong to F. 
It is now easy to show, and is well known: 
2.16 Clainx If CH holds then there is a Ramsey ultrafilter. 
2.17 Definition: For a filter F e.g., on ~, let 
Mt(PO = [f:f is a function from A = ~ mod F to [0,1], such that f-t([1]) 
is finite ] 
ordered by inclusion, we call this forcing notion Mathias forcing. 
As usual we identify the generic object with the Mathias real Ulf :f ~ G]. 
2.18 Theorem: 1) For any filter F Mr(F) satisfies the countable chain 
condition. 
2) For any ultrafilter F on ~ in a universe V, a real r (in a bigger 

209 
universe) is generic for Mr(F) (over V) iff for every A c F,r Cae A (i.e. 
r-~(llt) c~ a), 
3) If F is a Ramsey ultrafilter, t/It(F) has the Laver property. 
Proof: Left to the reader, anyhow the theorem is well known and we 
shall not use it. 
w The PP(P-point) property 
3.1 Definition: An ultrafilter D on co is called a P-point if for any count- 
ably many members of D there is a member of D almost included (i.e. except 
a finite set) in each of them. 
Those ultrafilters are called P-points because they were considered by 
general topologists as point in ~(co)-co (Walter Rudin introduced them). 
Assuming CH, 
P-points, and Ramsey ultrafilters exist. 
Note that any 
Ramsey ultrafilter is a P-point, but not conversely. Kunen has proved that if 
you add t~ 2 random reals (by finite support iteration) there is no Ramsey 
ultrafilter and the author proved the consistency of "there is no P-point"(see 
Wimmers [Wi] ). We shall give here another proof, and in the latter section use 
it to prove the consistency of "there is a unique Ramsey ultrafilter on co" (up 
to permutation of co) by a similar proof, whereas the first proof of the con- 
sistency of "there is no P-point" does not seem to generalize. 
Our program is as follows. 
We frst 
introduce PP-models, which (in 
preservation effects) are in the half way between Sacks models and cow_ 
bounding models. 
The proof that they are fine covering models (which is 
needed for proving that the associate PP-property is preserved by countable 
support iteration) is somewhat less trivial than the previous cases. 
The 
actual proof (of the consistency of no P-point) is carried in the next section. 
3.2 Definition: l) We call (D,R,<) a PP-model/3' : 

210 
a) For some subuniverse Vt (with the same Sl) D = H(Sl) vt 
b) z R Tiff z, T 9 D,x 9 6'aJ strictly increasing, T C ~>~ a closed subtree 
and T f~ n~ is finite for every n and:

for

there 
are 
k, 
and 
~% < i(0) < j (0) < ~(1) < 3 (1) <, .- < i(k) < j (It) < co 
and 
for

there 
are

T/g'rn(~) 9 T CI J(~)~, 
such 
that 
j(s

c) (D,R) covers, i.e., 
(Y~/9 ~)(u 
9 Dom R)(r4T 9 D)[x R T ^ ~ 9 Lim T] 
d) z < y iff z (n) > y (n) for every n, 
2) The class of such models is Kpp, a forcing notion has the PP- 
property if it is Kip -preserving, and a full PP-model is one for when In = 1/, 
we write Rip for the R and use it for D = H(Sl), 
3.3 Claim: 1) If the forcing notion P has the PP-property then it has 
the ~-bounding 
property; if P has the Sacks property then it has the PP- 
property. 
2) If (D,R,<) is a Sacks model then 
(Y17 e ~

If (D,R,<) is a PP-model then 
(V ~7 9 %o)(Vz)(3T 9 D) [if z 9 (Dom Rbd ) C~ D then z Rb~ T and 7/ 9 Lira T]. 
Proof: Easy. 
B.4 Claim- Any PP model (D,R,<) is a fine covering model. 
Proof: Let us check the conditions in Definition 1.2. 
a) a) Trivial by a),b) of Definition 3.1. 
b) Part c) of Definition 3.1 is a restatement of b). 
~) Trivial. 
7) By the proof of (~) 
6) So let (D,R,<) be a weak covering model in V[ G]. Let z > z? > Ym (for 
n <co), and,yn R T~. 
Let hm:~-* ~ be such that for any n 
there are 

211 
~(0) <j(0)<---<j(k),@g,r 
witnessing (*) of Definition 3.2(b) for Ym R T~ 
such that j(/c) < hm(n ). Now we define ~ by induction on i, n o = 0 and ~+1 
is such that: 
for some g0,gl ..... 
gj ..... 
g0 =~, 
s 
=hj(s 
+ 1, and 
~zr 1 = g~+a. Let T* = [D: for every i,)/t n( c U Tj]. 
So clearly x Rpp T" but maybe T" ~ D. Let h ~ 
~ co be defined for T" as 
h m 
was 
defined 
for 
T~. 
So 
by 
3.3(3) 
there 
is 
h~ 
N u~, 
(u 
In

We 
now 
choose

and 
Clearly z c D. 
n

there 
are 
let 
z(n) = ~+1- 
So, remembering 1.9, we can apply the "covering property" of (D,R) to T ~ 
(i.e., the branch T" induce in TTR). Apply it for z and we get an appropriate 
closed subtree r 
D = H(~I) l~ of TTR, (so T ~ A n='~ ccfor every ~z). Clearly 
T" = U t is a closed subtree of o>~, it belongs to D, and there is no problem 
teC 
to prove T ~ ~ T ~176 The only point left is why x R T ~176 
Let T t be the set of f E ~ such that if n < ~, h~176 ,~ ht(t) then for some 
k < ht(t), j(]c) < ht(t) the statement in (8) of Definition 3.2(5) holds (for t) . 
Let ~' be the maximal closed tree c d. It is easy to check that d, ~ C D, and 
that the branch T ~ induce is c ~', so w.l.o.g. C=d =~. 
Now 
for 
arbitrarily 
large 
n, 
there 
are 
k < n, 
and 
n <i(0) <j(0) <i(1) <j(1) <..-<i(k)

and 
for

i(g) + re(g) + 1 < ~(s163

212 
So 
by 
the

for

there

3.9 Definition: A forcing notion P has the strong PP-property if for 
every p e P, P-name f of a member of ~

infinity, there are q,p ": q e P, and a perfect tree T c ~>~, such that

3.10 Claim= The strong PP-property implies the PP-property. 

213 
Proof: Let p c P, af a P-name of a member of ~to, and x c ~to strictly 
increasing. As the strong PP-property implies the ~to -bounding property we 
can assume p I[-"f c Lim TI" ,T 1 c~to a closed tree, T t Clnca finite for 
every 
n. 
Let, 
for 
n < to 
, 
hl(n ) = x(n + n) 
and 
for 
s < to, 
h(s 
= Max ~n "hl(n ) < s 
Clearly h diverge to infinity. Apply the definition 
of "strong PP-property "to p,P,f,h, and gel q,p ": q c P, and a perfect tree 
T ~ ~>to, q [~-p"f ~ Lim T': and A = ~n < to: [ T Yl nco[ ~ h(n)] is infinite. Let 
Tg be a maximal closed tree 
~ TA T1, so clearly q I[-"f c]AmT 2'', and 
IT2 n"toI - IT~ n"toI, IT2 n"toI < IT n"toI < h(,~). 
Let s ~ A, n = h(s 
and assume n > 0, then hl(n ) < g <-- hl(n + 1), hence 
for 
n,

---n, 
j(O) =g 
|n0.g:g < IT2 ne2I] = Te nea, 
rn(o) = IT 2 C1 s 
-1 ~ h(g) -n 
(It - i!) exemplify the requirement because 
Now n diverges to infinity together with s so there are no problems. 
w There may be no P-point 
We introduce the forcing notion P(F) (introduced by Gregorief) which 
adds, for an ultrafilter F, a set A, to-A, A ~ ~bmod D. If F is a P-point this 
forcing is a-proper for every a <to1, and has the PP-property. Our point is 
that P(F) ea enjoy all these properties and in addition I~p(f)J'F cannot be 
completed to a P-point " The way is as follows: as we use P(F) ~a, we get ~a 
new subset A n of to, such that not only to-A n,A n ~ ~bmod D, but also they are 
quite independent over F. We let A~ be An if s = 0,to-An if s = 1. Now not 
only cannot we extend F to a P-point, but we shall show that for no f ~ w2 is 
there A,A cae A~ (n) for each n. 

214 
If not, there is h:r 
-, ~, such that 
~ (A~ (n) U[0,h(n)]) 
is infinite. Now by 
the PP-condition 
we know in V enough information 
on f 
and h to use our 
freedom to give information on the A n's to get a contradiction. 
We originally (see [Wi]) use the stronger version of the PP-property, 
but 
there were problems with the preservation 
theorem 
i.e., in [Wi] the essential 
forcing was not an iteration. 
Note that, we continue to add reals after forcing with P(PO ~ so in fact we 
prove the above holds also if we force with Q, P(F) ~ < Q,Q has the PP pro- 
perty. 
So the importance 
of proving that it is preserved 
is clear. The itera- 
tion in the end is standard. 
The proofs in [Wi] use not exactly P(F)% 
Rather 
we note that 
if Q 
satisl~es 
the 
c.c.c, 
then 
for 
any 
P-point 
F 0 
in 
V P 
there 
is 
F 1 =~A cco:A ~ V, I[-•"A cF 
"] which is a filter enjoying some of the pro- 
"0 
perties of F 0 : p(~)/F~ 
(in V) is a Boolean algebra satisfying the c.c.c, and (if 
Q 
has 
the 
"~-bounding 
property), 
for 
every 
A n c F 1 there 
is A ~ F 1, 
^ A ~a, An- Let |F ~ : i < ~t2] (assuming G.C.H. ) list all such filters in V. Now 
the product 
P with countable support of P(F~) ~ satisfies : in V p , no /~ can 
be extended 
to a P-point by an argument 
as mentioned 
above. However to 
close the proof we need "P satisfies the c.c.c. ': Which fails. But we replace 
P by a subset which satisfies it and still have the desirable other properties. 
That proof can be modified to have 2 t% > t~ 2, whereas for the present proof we 
do not know how to do this. 
4.1 Definition: For a filter D on a set I let 
1) P(D) = {f:f 
a function from B to {0,1] for some B = tbmod D, 
i.e. B C I,I - B E D], ordered by inclusion 
2) pt(D) = ~3 ~ e P(D):f-l(|l{) 
is finite {. 
4.1A Remark: Silver use P(D) for D the filter of co-finite subsets of r 

215 
Mathias used P?(D) for D the filter of cofinite subsets 
of ~ and for /7 an 
ultrafilter, Gregorief used P(D) for D ultrafilter, and proved that it collapses 
tl 1 iff it is not a P-point. 
4.2 Lenmm: If F is a P-point 
then 
Q = P(F) ~ is u-proper 
(in fact a- 
proper for every a) and has the strong PP-property. 
First define 
4.2 Definition: 1) A filter F 
on I is called a P-filter 
if for every 
A~ E F(n < ~) there is A c F, A ~ae An for every n. 
2)We call F fat if for every family of finite pairwise disjoint

Fact: 
Let 
F ~ be 
[A ~c~x~: 
for 
every 
n 
for 
some 
BcF, 
A N (|n] x co) = In J x B], where F is a fat P-filter . Then F ~ is a fat P-filter 
on ~ x co, and (the forcing notion) Q = P(F) ~ is isomorphic to P(F~ 
Proof 
of 
the 
Fact: 
F ~ 
is 
a 
Pofilter; 
let 
A~ c F', 
then 
A~ N(~n] 
xc~)=~n~ 
xBk,n, 
B~,n ~F. 
As F 
is a P-filter 
there 
is /Y'~F, 
B'~a. 
Bk,n for every k,n. 
Let H~=B ~ N (3 H~,e, A = UIn] xB~. 
Clearly 
/r <~ 
n 
B~ c F 
(as we have 
assumed 
that 
F 
is a

A~ 
F ~ 
Now 
A/c -A ~ C U|n] x(gk, n --B~) (;:: U lnl x (Bk,e -g~ ) but 
each B~, e -B~, is 
k~n 
finite hence A/~ -A ~ is finite hence A ~ ~ae A~, but k is arbitrary. 
So A ~ is as 
required. 
F ~ is fat: Let wn c ~ x ~ be finite for n < r 
We define by induction 
on n 
an infinite S e c ~, Se+ 1 c S n such that 
|i:<n,i>c 
U ws 
=~$modD. 
There 
is 
no 
problem 
in 
this, 
and 
let 
s 
k(n) = Min (S e - [/r 
" - - k(n-1)J). 
It 
is 
easy 
to 
check 
U wk(e) = 0 rood F ~ So we have established 4.3.

So it suffices (for proving Lemma 4.1) to prove: 
4.4 Lemma: If F is a fat P-filter on a countable set then P(F) is r 
proper (in fact a-proper for every a) and has the strong PP-property. 
Proof 
of 
4.4: 
W.l.o.g. 
F 
is 
a 
filter 
on 
~. 
So 
let poOP(F), 
Po,F ~ N ~ ~H(A),c> ,N countable A large enough. Now, before proving prop- 
erness, we prove: 
4.5 Crucial Fact: For every p c P(F) and a P(F)-name t of an ordinal 
and r~ < r 
there is q ~ P(F),p < q, such that for every g :Iz -, 2, there is an 
ordinal ag such that (q t [n,~]) U Y ]l-p(r) "t = ag. 
Proof: Let gr 
< 2 n) be a list of all function g:n --, 2. We shall define by 
induction Pc ~ P(F) increasing (i.e. Pc ~ Pc§ 
Let p 0 = P, and if Pc is defined 
let 
pet = 
t 
u 
Clearly pC t E P(F) hence there are ag and p~ e P(F),pct.<p; such that 
P~ II-p(F) "t = ag". Let Pi+l =Pc UP~ "t [~,*'). Clearly Pc <-Pc§ c P(F), and 
(Pi+l t (n,~)) U g I!- "t = ag " Sop(2, ) is as required from q. 
So we have proved Fact 4.5. 
Continuation of the Proof of 4.4: Let |tc:~ < w} be a list of all P(F)- 
names of ordinals which belong to N. We define by induction on n, 
Pn E P(F) C~ N, p~ < Pn+l ~o already defined) such that: 
(*) if g:n -~ 2 = ~0,1],s < n then for some ordinal a(g,s 

217 
0~,, r [,.,,=]) u g I1-~,(~) "t~ : =(g,s 
This can be done by the crucial Fact 4.5. Now let A n be the domain of pn, 
so A n =~bmodF 
hence 
~--A~ oF. 
As P is a P-filter there 
is A, ~--A CD, 
(co-A) E= (~-An) 
i.e., 
A a E~ A. 
Hence 
there 
are 
/r 
<c0 
such 
that 
(A n -- [0,/cn]) C A. w.l.o.g. A 0 = Domp 
c A. 
Now we shall choose natural numbers 
s 
< s 
< s 
<.., and want to 
choose them such that 
q =po u u(p,~(,.,) r [s 
n 
is (N,P(F))-generic. The only nontrivial point is q c P(F) as trivially Po < q 
and for any n, (pe(~)r[s 
(qt[0,g(n))<q, 
hence 
q I]-" for 
s < n, ta c |a(g,g(n)) : g a function fromg(n) 
to 2}. 
So as q is a function from a subset of c0 to 2 , we only have to prove 
Dom q = ~mod D, but 
Dom q-A = 
U (Dom (Domp~(n)-A-[O,g(n)]) = 
= u(D~ 
N [s (n),k~(n)] -A) 
n 
(remember A n - [0,kn] E A,A o r A). 
Now let we = [s 
(for s < ca) which is a finite set. As Min w e = s there 
is an infinite S E ea such that ~we:s c SJ is a family of pairwise disjoint sets, 
hence 
as 
F 
is 
fat 
there 
is 
an 
infinite 
S 1 E S 
such 
that 
U|We:s c Sll = ~bmod D. So let ~s 
< ~} be a list of the members 
of S 1, 
s 
< s 
So q c P(F), hence q is (N,P(F))-generic, and as q < P0, we have proved 
that P(F) is proper. 
In fact not only is q (N,P(F))-generic, but even q r [~,=) 
for any n < ~. 

218 
Let us prove P(F) is a-proper for any countable a, by induction on a. Let 
~N~:i < a> be as in V.3.1, p e P(F), p,F e No; we shall prove that not only is 
there q ~ p, (Nr 
for every i < a, but also q r[n,~) is (NoP(F))- 
generic (for i ~ a,n < ~). If a = 0 we have proved this, if a is a successor use 
the induction hypothesis. So assume a is limit and let a = tJ an, an < an§ 
n<w 
We define by induction qn ~ Na,§ 
such that for every i ~ a, Ic < ~, qn t [k ,~) 
is (Nr 
qo ~P, qn+l ~ qn. Now in the previous part of the proof 
we have really shown: 
4.6. Fact: If pn ~Pn+z (for n < ~,pn c P(F)) then there is q ~ P(F), 
q ~P0, q ~Pn r [n,~) for infinitely many n's. 
Apply the fact to PO,qO,ql ..... 
and get q as required, remember that as 
q is (Nr 
for every i < a, it is also (N,,,P(F))-generic. 
From Lemma 4.4 only the strong PP-property remains. 
So let x ~ *~ 
diverge to infinity, and let f ~ N be a P(F)-name of a member of ~, 
and 
w.l.o.g, assume that for n < r 
t2n = f 
where Itn:n < ca] was a list of the 
names of ordinal used in the proof of the properness of P(F). When we define 
the pn, by induction on n, make one change in (*): 
Instead considering s < n , we consider the s such that s ~ 2j~ where 
3n = min [i:z(i) > 2~]. Hence bypn's definition, for some h 
p~ r In,| 
IFp(~"f r j,, e ~%.~ :g:~ ~ 21". 
So Pn r [n,~) allows f r Jn at most 2 n possibilities which is smaller than x (in)- 
As q ~ Pn [n,~) for infinitely n,q "allow" f r jn less than x (in) possibilities, so 
N 
we finish. 
4.7 Lemma: Suppose F is a P-point and P(F) w <o P and P has the PP- 
property. 

219 
Then in Y P, F cannot be extended to a P-point.

4.8 Theorem : It is consistent with ZFC + 2 ~~ = ~2 that there is no P- 
point. 
Proof: Left to the reader, or see the 5.17, where a similar proof is car- 
ried out. 
w There may exist a unique Ramsey ultrafilter 
Usually it is significantly harder to prove that there is a unique object 
than to prove there is none. The proof is similar to the one in the previous 
section, but here we are destroying other Rarnsey ultrafilter (in fact "almost" 
all other P-points) while preserving our precious Ramsey ultrafilters. 
More exactly we shall prove the consistency of "there is a unique Ramsey 
ultrafilter F 0 on r 
up to permutation of r 
such that for every P-point F, 
F0 ~zK 2". 
Note that if there is a unique P-point it should be Ramsey; however, we do 
not know whether there may be a unique P-point. 
Our scheme is to start with a universe with a fixed Ramsey ultrafilter F 0' 
preserve its being an ultrafilter and even a Ramsey ultra filter. For this we 
need a new kind oF covering model (UFba(F))-models which we use to get the 
preservation theorem. So our ultrafilter will be generated by t~ 1 sets. Now in 
each stage we shall try to destroy a given P-point F such that F 0 ~R/( F. The 

222 
forcing from w does not work, but if we use a version of it parallel to Sacks 
forcing it will work. 
5.1 Proposition: 1) We call (D,R) a UF(F)-model where F is an ultrafilter 
on ~, or even a family of nonempty subsets of ~ closed under (finite) intersec- 
tion which generates an ultrafilter (we shall not always distinguish strictly 
between F and the filter it generates) if: 
a) For some subuniverse V t (with the same ~1) D = H(H1) ~ 
b) zRT iff z C=~ C~D, T~=>~ 
a perfect tree, T~D 
and, for some 
s c ~0,1~, 
In < ~: for some ~/~ T f1 ~>2, 7/(n) = s 
is disjoint from some 
A c F (so ~/c T N ~2 determine 7/r (~-A) c Vt and x appears trivially. 
c) (D,R) covers i.e. (V~/c a~)(Vz c Dom R)(:~T E D)[xRT + V E Lim T] 
2) The class of such models is KuF, and for a specific F, KuF(~D; 
the full KuF(Fymodel is the one with D = H(~I), and for it F = RgF(F). 
5.2 Definition: A UFbg(F)-model is defined similarly except that in b) we 
add "T C~ '~ is finite for each n ~ We use the conventions of 5.1(2) and note 
that any UF~(F)-model is a UF(F)-model. 
5.3 Claim= 1) Suppose (D,R) is a UF(F)-model (hence, a weak covering 
model) and the forcing notion P is proper and (D,R)-preserving. Then in V P, 
F still generates an ultrafilter. 
~) In 1) , if F is a P-point in V, it is a P-point in V P, provided 
that P is proper. 
3) If the ultrafilter F generates in V is a Ramsey ultrafilter, and 
(D,R) a UFbd (F)-model, P 
(D,R)-preserving then in V P, F still generates an 
ultrafilter which is Ramsey. 
Proof: 1) F 
still generates 
an ultrafilter, because as P is (D,R)- 
preserving, in V P (D,R) is still a weak covering model, so by the covering 
condition, F still generates an ultrafilter. 
2) As for being a P=point, let p I]-P "~A :n < ~] is included in 
the ultrafilter F generates ': So w.l.o.g, p I~p "A E F", and by properness

in V, F generates a Ramsey ultrafilter there is A e F, A N Ink',n(+1) has at 
most one element. Checking carefully in V[G] we see that for every n,

has at most two elements. 
Let A 0 = |k e A : there are 
no i,kt such that k ~ kt are both in [~z.[G], r~+l[G])~, so either A 0 or A-A 0 
belong to the Ultrafilter which F generates, and both are as required. 
5.4 Claim: If F ~ p(c0) generates an ultrafilter which is a P-point then 
any UF(F)-model is a fine covering model for proper forcing. 
Proof: So let us check the conditions of Definition 1.2. 
a) a) Trivial by a), b) of Definition 3.1. 
b) Part e) of definition 3.1 is a restatement of b). 
~) Trivial. 
7) Follows from (~) 
~) Let V[G] be a generic extension by a proper (P,R)-preserving forc- 
ing notion. 
So let x >xt>y~+l

5.6 Claim: If F ~ p(o) generates a Ramsey ultrafilter then any UF~ (F)- 
model is a fine covering model for proper forcing. 
Proof: The same as the previous one, with the addition of what we do in 
~.2 (for (D,R) e K~a). 
5.7 Conclusion: 1) "K~(F)-preservance + (~,1) - proper " is preserved 
by countable support iteration for F a P-point. 
2) "Kvy6~(F)-preservance + (~,l)-properness " is preserved by 
countable support iteration for F a Ramsey ultrafilter. 
5.8 Claim= 1) If F generates a P-point and the forcing notion Q is 
(D,R)-preserving for the full UF(Y)-model then it is (D,R)-preserving for 
every UF(F)-model. 
2) If F generates Ramsey ultrafilter, and the forcing notion Q is 
(D,R)-preserving for the full UFba(F)-model then it is (D,R)-preserving for 
the UFb,~(F)-model.

5.10 Lemma: Let F be a P-point ultrafilter on 0J. Then SP(F) is proper, 
in fact a-proper for every a < ~1, and has the strong PP-property; and so is 
SP(F) ~ (the set Cpn :n < e~ ,p~ c SP(F), ordered coordinate-wise). 
Proof: Quite Lhe same as the proof of 4.4, but still we shall give some 
details. The following theorem is due to Galvin and McKenzie,(but later (5.15) 
we shall prove in detail a similar theorem; note that we use only the "only if" 
direction.) 
5.11 Theorem= Let F be an ultrafilter on c0. Then F is a P-point [Ram- 
sey ultrafilter] iff in the following game player I has no winning strategy: 
in the n'th move: 
player I chooses A n c F 
player II choose wn ~ A~,wn finite [singleton]. 
In the end player II wins if U wn E F. 
Proof of 5.10: We just have to define a strategy for player I, (in the game 
from 5.11) playing on the side with the conditions in the forcing. As F is a P- 

227 
point, there is a play in which he uses the strategy and II wins the play; this 
will give us the desired sequence of conditions. 
Similar thing is done in more detail in the proof of 5.16. 
5.12 Lemma: If F is a P-point ultrafilter, SP(F) ~ ~ Q, Q has the PP- 
property then in V Q, F cannot be extended to an ultrafilter. 
Proof: The proof is almost identical with the proof of 4.7, so we do not 
carry it. 
We now state some well known basic facts on the Rudin-Keistler order on 
ultrafilters. 
5.13 Definition: 1) Let F1,F 2 be ultrafilters 
on I1,I 2 , respectively. 
Fz ":RK F2 if: 
there is a function f from I 2 to I~,f (Is) = if (i):i c I2| c Ft and A c F 1 iff 
f-l(A) e F~ 
2) In such case we say F 1 = f (Fz) , if I lzl -< I&l we can assume 
w.l.o.g, f is onto I a. 
Remark: We shall use only ultrafilters on c0, which are not principal, i.e. 
fl(ea)-~ in topological notation. 
It is known (see e.g. [J] ) 
5.14 Theorem: 1) -<e2c is a quasi-order 
2) An ultrafilter F on r 
is minimal iff it is Ramsey (minimal 
means F? ~---RK F ~ 
F "r 
Ft 
3) If F is a P-point, Ft ~RK F then F t is a P-point. 
4) If F 1 <--RK F2 ~gtc F1, then there is a permutation J 
of co such 
that F z = y (F1). 

228 
Proof: Well known. 
5.15 Lemma: Suppose Fo,F 1 are ultrafilters on ~, F1 a P- point, F 0 a 
Ramsey ultrafilter, and not F 0 -----RK F1. 
Then in the following game player I has no winning strategy: 
in the nth move, n even: 
player I chooses An 9 F0 
player II chooses k n 9 An 
in the nth move, n odd: 
player ] chooses A n 9 F 1 
player II chooses a finite set w,~ ~ A n 
In the end player II wins if ~1r :n <~

] erl. 
Proof: Suppose G is a wining strategy of player I. Let ~ be big enough , 
N .~ <H(A),e>,Fo,F1,G e N and N is countable. 
As F 1 is a P-point there is 
A ~ 9 F 1 such that A* Ca, B for every B 9 F 65 N. 
Now we can find an increasing sequence <M n:n < ~> of finite subsets of 
N, N = 
U/v/n such that it increases rapidly enough; more exactly: 
a) G,Fo,F1 e Ma,M,~ 9 M,~+I

Let u~+ 1 = (Mn. 1 -Mn)

there

and 
n <m 
9 S~ ==> m--n ~ 10. 
Can we demand also n 9 So, m e S 1 implies the absolute value of n - m 
is >- 5? For the So,S 1 we have, for each n there is at most one m such that

So in the bad case there are S;~ c Sg, f:S~ -, SI

Ulun:n ES~I eFs moreover, for any S~ cS~,

Also as F 0 is a Ramsey ultrafilter, there are k n 9 u n(n 9 S~) such that 
lkn:n 9 S~| 9 F o. 
So 
the 
function

(**) there are k~[ 9 u,(n e So) such that Ik~:n < a~] 9 F 0. This is because

let

Now there is no problem to define by induction on JZ < ~, ng< e~, and an 
initial segment of length s of a play of the game (both increasing) such that: 
the initial segment belong to Mn,; and every k~(vn) will appear among the k's 
(wn's) we chose in the play if n~ns 
, n eS O (n 9 
and player I use his 
strategy. But in the play we produce II wins, contradiction. 
5.16 Main Lemma: Suppose F 0 is a Ramsey ultrafilter (on ~), F a P- 
point, and Q = SP(F) 
, [~-q ,'F o is not an ultrafilter "then F 0 <--RK F. 
Proof: 
Let

A 
an 
SP(F)-name, 
To I~-Q "A C m ; ~-A, A # # mod F" and w.l.o.g. I[-Q "A C m", (such To,A exists 
as after forcing with Q, F 0 will no longer be (in fact, generate) an ultrafilter. 
Note that for any T m To:

,T? I~-g"n r A"~ e f o 

230 
Now we use the game defined in Lemma 5.15. We shall describe a winning 
strategy for player I. During the play, player I in his moves also defines 
Tn e Q preserving the following: 
(*) Tn+ I ~" T~,spt(T n) D U[Wg:s odd, g < hi, 
and T. ]~-Q "leg e A"forg even, g < n. 
More exactly, player I chose T.+ 1 in the nth move after player II's play. 
This is enough, as if in the end UIWs 
< co odd I e F l, then ~ Tne Q, 
and it forces {/c~:s < co even ] c A. so I/c~:g < co even | ~ F 0 by the hypothesis 
on T 0, A. Note that T o is defined.

A~ = ~k < co: there are T,~.~.T~,~.~ ~ (Tn)[,~]. 
belong to F 0. 
Now 
Now player I plays A n =

Player II chooses some/c n e A n 
Player I ("on the side") let Tn+ 1 =

(it is clearly as required in (*)

Player II chooses a finite w~ ~ A n 

231 
and player I let :In+ 1 = Try. 
5.17 Theoremc It is consistent with ZFC + 2 tl~ = 112 that, up to permuta- 
tion on ~, there is a unique Ramsey ultrafilter on ~0. Moreover any P-point is 
above it (in the Rudin-Keisler order). 
Proof: 
If we could in 5.16 replace Q = SF(F) by Q = SP(F) ~~ the 
theorem is immediate from the previous lemmas (and using the same outline 
as in w 
As this is not clear we shall introduce below SF"(F), which is half 
way between SP(F) and SP(F)% 
The same proofs as before show that it 
satisfies the conclusions of 5.10, 5.13, 5.16. 
We 
start 
with 
a 
universe 
satisfying 
gtt0 = t~ 1 + 2t~, = tl 2 
and 
0 l~ ~l%:cf6 =~|" There is a Rarnsey ultrafilter F in V. We shall use 
a CS iterated forcing ~ P~,O.:i < 112), using only g~F~(~')- preserving foreings, 
so by &3(1), 5.4, 1.7, F continues to be a Ramsey ultrafilter and by VIII w 
P~os satisfies the ~2-ehain condition. If F 1 c V[G~](G c P~0~ generic) is a P- 
point, not above F, then there is a T E P~foreing F is like that, and for a

closed unbounded set of ~ < 11~,cf~ = 111 implies that F 1 = F /'3 P (co) ~e E V p" P 
forces and it to be a P-point not above F. 
Now by the diamond we can assume that for some such 6,Q$ = p'(F~); so 
by lemma 5.16 F I cannot be completes to a P-point in V e'2. 
We can finish by theorem 5.14.

w On the W2-chain condition 
When we prove various consistency results by iterating proper forcings, 
we have many times to check that the a2-chain condition holds. 
Remember we have Q = <Pi,Q :i < a>, Q. a Pi- name of a proper forcing 
(in 
VV~)o Pa = If :Domf 
a 
countable 
subset 
of 
a,i E Domf 
implies 
r 
(i) (z Q. " i.e. f(i) is a Pi -name of a member of Q~]. So P. is proper 
by III 3.2. 
Remark: Note that even if I~-p("lQil =~1" 
still maybe ]P21 =L9~1 as 
there may be many P1 -names of elements of Q1- 
1.1. Lemma: If g is regular, (V~< g)/~~ < ~,VP'~"JQ= I <g" then P. 
satisfies the x-chain condition. 
Proof: See III 4.1. 
1.2. Definition: P satisfies the z - e.c.c. (g extra chain condition) pro- 
vided that there is a two place relation R on P (usually having a least upper 
bound) such that: 
A) for any Pi E P(i < g) there are a pressing down functions fn:g-* g 
(i.e. 
(Ya)fn(a) < 1 +a

234 
Remark: This is very similar to the condition used in [Sh 78a]. The real 
difference is the absence of Bl-completeness. The fact that there (in [Sh 78] 
(C) parallel to A)) we use one function and closed unbounded C, and demand 
i,j e C, cf i = cf j = ~1; is just an equivalent form more convenient here. The 
role of lo~,,q~ is just to show Ip,~:n < r 
< r 
have an upper bound (so 
for Sl-complete forcing they are not needed). 
1.3. Lemma: Suppose 
V~=2 Bo=~I , (V/z<g)/z ~~ 
, ~ is regular. 
Suppose further Q = ~ P,,~ :i < a 0 ~ ~ 
is a CS iteration. 
Suppose also 
(a) Each Qa is (<~l)-proper (= a - proper for each a < aJ1); 
(b) Each Q~ is [~-complete for some ~ 1-completeness system from V and 
e.g. it is on X .= 21P~I,A > ~; 
(c) Each Qa satisfies the g- e.c.c. 
Then Pa0 satisfies the ~-c.c. (= ~ chain condition). 
Remark: 1) Compare with Theorem 7.1 from V. 
We add to the hypothesis part (c) (and a 0 <-~),, and get the ~-c.c. We shall 
also repeat the proof. 
2) We can weaken Definition 1.2 and the proof of 1.3 still works, by e.g. 
strengthening 
the 
hypothesis 
on 
the 
Pn,qn 
in 
B 
(i.e. 
qn+l E.9[q,~], 
Pn+l c.9[p,~] where for r c P,.9[r] C P) is a dense subset of P. Note that 
1.2(B) is satisfied for R = having a least upper bound; when P is #1 - complete. 
Also 1.2(a) can be weaker by e.g. demanding in the conclusion: 
for any 
/.,j c A, for some A in some appropriate filter. 
Proof: As in lemma III 4.1, w.l.o.g, a 0 < ~. Let R be (a P~-name) exempli- 
fying Definition 1.2 for Q. Let pC e Pa~ (i < Iv) be given. We now define by 
induction on r~ < co, models N~ (for all a < ~ simultaneously) such that 
i) N~a ~r ~H(A),E),Pa, E l~,,p, e N ~ , [IN~ [I = ~0,a e N ~ . 
ii) ~ 
~: N~a +1 . 

235 
For r~ = 0, choose any N ~ satisfying (i). 
If we have defined for n, let N~a C% P.~ = IP.,~ : ~ < ~| , 
" 
P..O =P." 
For i < a0,s < ~, consider the sequence <P~ajZ (i):a < g>. 
In V P~ it is a sequence of length g of elements of Qi. But Qi (in V P~ ) satisfy 
the 
~; e.c.e., so there are functions -"

exemplifying that con-

We now define AP2. +I such that hP2a -r N~. +I < < H(A),e)>, and

Let N~ =

completeness 
is only for N,N N r176 r S (i.e., (li~,S)-completeness); also in (<a) 
properness we can demand N~ N ~1 t~ S. 
2.1. Theorem: Suppose Consis(ZFC + "~ 
is 
2 *- supercompact'3. 
Then Consis(ZFC + Axiom I ). 
Proof: We define Qi by induction on i < ~ 
(x is 
2 x- supercompact 
in 
V), P~ as usual. 
Case I: If i is not strongly 
inaccessible, 
Qi is the Levi collapse of 
(21P'l) vh tO btl:Q ~ = |f:lDomf 
] =~0, Domf 
c aq, Rangf 
c (2le~)I/"]. 
Case 11: If i is strongly inaccessible, and in V P~ there is a forcing P, with 
universe i and ~)j ~ i(j < i) 
P proper, ~)i predense , and 
|j:thereis 
G c j, directed by ~ , 
AG 
ND t ~ 0] is not stationary, 
then Qr = P. 
Case HI: not I nor II - act like I. 
Px is proper, satisfies the ~-e.c. (by Lemma 1.1) so in V P• 
case ] ). 
So from Axiom I, 1), 3) holds, (3) - as in III w 
2 #~ = x = H z (by 

238 
Suppose in the end R~) (a < ~) are Pz - names of a counterexample 
to 
2'). 
Let E be a filter over S<z(2 ~) exemplifying ~ is 2Z-supercompact; and we 
code P,c, R,D (a < ~) on ~. Let 
S0 = IA 9 S<z(2"):]9(A C~ ~) ~ A and A closed under 
reasonable 
opera- 
tion, and A ('1 ~ a strongly inaccessible cardinal |. 
Then for A 9 So, the forcing notion, A f~ Pz = PAt%p,c, RF A are proper (see 
definition of proper where we discuss this: in 2 IPI we can get a witness for 
properness 
etc): So we have proved that PA~P,~ , R f~ A , <Aa:a < ~ 
are 
candidates for the case 1I in the definition of Q~. So if A 9 S 0, then i = A f~ 
is inaccessible 
and there 
are other 
P~,~)~(j </)which 
we have actually 
chosen. 
By 
the 
properties 
of 
E, 
there 
are 
such 
i(0) < i(1) , /~(0) C p~(1) , ~)~(0) = ~)~(1) f~ i(0) for j < i(0) and we almost 
get contradiction to the choice of/~(1). 
Using such i(~) ~ <_ A, i(A) = A which form a stationary subset of A we get 
a contradiction. 
Remark: We essentially use the proof that 0 
z holds for ~ measurable, 
which is well known. 
2.2: 
Theorem: 
1) 
Consis(ZFC + z 2Z-supercompact) 
implies 
Consis(ZFC + Axiom II + G.C.H> ). 
2) In both cases (2.1. , 2.2) we can relativize to S. (S c ~1 stationary , 
costationary 
) If in Axiom II we assume 
I PI < 2 t~' 
no large cardinality is 
needed. 
Proof: 1) Similar. 
2) Just note that the same iteration work. 

239 
2.3. Discussion: In almost all the applications we need a weaker version 
of the axioms for whose consistency we do not need a large cardinal. 
Usually our task is to show that for every A c H(~I),]A I =Si there is 
B C H(r l) such that 
H(r 
~ ~a(a,B) 
for Axiom II, ~o is any first order (or L~,,~,) sentence, for Axiom I ~ should have 
quantifications on A,B only. 
So we iterate r 
times only, each time forcing a B for a given A, till we 
catch our tail in eo 2 (we can have I A ] C t~ 2 and visit A A VP" for stationarily 
manya<~2 
, cfa =~l). 
So Consis (ZFC) only is needed. 
For Axiom I part (3), g inaccessible suffice; whether it is necessary is still 
not clear to me. Vie can do Axiom I without inaccessible in the cases above, 
when we are able, provably, to'find QA in an intermediate 
V. For P~ to satisfy 
the t~-c.c, we need ]QAI = B1- With inaccessible QA should just have smaller 
cardinality. 
For 
]P[ =t~ l, if Pc 
V Pa , a<o 
a , P 
proper 
in V P~* it is proper 
in 
VVa(though not vice versa ). So Axiom I 2) for ]P] =~l comes under the pre- 
vious discussion. 
There may be applications where we really have to use information on 
VPa(a < r 
to build Qa, mainly Axiom I, when we want to build a forcing giving 
B for a given A (see above) and we want to use CH or <~ 
for the building. 
! 
But with Axioms I, II ( or version we can get with inaccessible) we can use the 
axiom: collapse L #~, building a forcing and look at the composition (see w 
Application G). 

240 
Sometimes we use properties of Pa (like ~ 
- boundedness) which usually 
we demand from each Qi, AND from P in the axiom and have to prove Pa 
satisfies (see Chapter VI 1. 
However still l,lI looks to me reasonable choice. We shall use them, and 
can remark, that only Consis (ZFC/is needed. 
As we mentioned (see III w 
) Consis (ZFC + inaccessible ) implies the 
consistency of 
Ax Ia: If IP] =Sz, P does not destroy stationary sets Di c P predense 
(i < r 
then there is a directed G C P, 
We can ask whether we can get something like Axiom I for L :~~ t~ 3. 
Baunlgartner [B] proved this is difficult, by proving that: 
2.4. Theorem: (Baumgartner) i) If Q = <Pn,Q :~z < co> is a CS iteration, 
NI,& 
Q non trivial (i.e. above every element there are two incompatible ones I then 
Nn 
]Am Q does not satisfy the 2M~ 
condition. 
2) If Q=<Pt,Q :i <~z> is a CS iteration, Q non trivial, 2M~ >I~l then 
Lim Q collapse 2 hI~ to Ir I. 
2.5. Question: 1) What kind of axioms can we get with: 
A) ~o = s37 
B) with t~ 1 < 3 #~ < 2S'? 
21 Can we define properness so that it works for higher cardinals 
(e.g., for SH.)? 
For 1) a partial answer,more exactly solution for particular problems 
appear in [AS]. 

241 
2.6. ]lore Discussion: In connection with the beginning of the previous 
discussion, if for A ~ H(ol)[A [ =l~ 1 we need to force by some QAof large car- 
dinality to get some H c oral , this is no problem. We iterate up to the first 
inaccessible. Baumgartner and Mekler have improved Theorem 2.1 as follows. 
2.7 Theorem= 1) (Mekler) In 2.2(1) we can weaken the hypothesis on ~ to 
~22-indescribability (the advantage of this property is that if ~ satisfies it in 
V,, it satisfies it in L). 
2) (Baumgartner) If ~ is supercompact, in some forcing extension of Vt 
of V, l~l 1~ = btlg, bt2 I~ = ~, 2 bt~ =1~ 2 and: 
for any proper forcing P, and P-names S.(i < ol) such that I~p('S. is a 
stationary subset of co 1'', there /s a directed G ~ P, and stationary Sr C ~1 
(i<ol) 
such that for every ji 
<o i, for some p c G , p[~-"j cS 
" and 
j E Sr orp]~-"j ~ S "and j ~ Si. 
~/, 
Proof: 1) For simplicity asume V = L. 
We define the CS iteration <Pi,Q.:i < ~>, such that 
I Pr 
< ~, and each 
Q.-proper, and Q is the first P-name of a counterexample for "'V P~ satisfies 
the axiom ". 
2) By Laver [L], w.l.o.g. ~ remains supercompact by an c-complete forc- 
ing. Force by 
[Q:Q is a CS iteration of proper forcing of power ~ < g(q) < ~] ordered by 
being initial segment. The generic object is, essentially such Q of length ~, so 
force by Lira Q. w 
Applications of Axiom II 
Application A: It implies SII(= SI~l ), in fact - every Aronszajn tree is 
special. (See V. 6.1.) Alternatively see Application F. 
Application B: On isomorphism of Aronszajn 
trees

unbounded set of levels, etc, see U. Avraham and S. Shelah [AS].

Proof: Let PF = If :Dom f 
an ordinal <~1 , Rang f C co, and for every 
limit ~ ~ Sup Dora f) the condition above holds ]. Now a-properness is very 
easy. Now we prove [~-completeness, ~ a simple S0-completeness system. 
We have to note that if N is a countable elementary submodel of 
<H(A),e>, 
PF e N, N f~ ~i = ~, P e N, ~

A = u(Rang ~1~ - a~) has order type ~ and find q ~p, ( N,PF)- generic, q t A 
= constant ~%. 
More formally, (see V. 5.2, 5.3) , we shall define ~<N,P n N,p>' as a filter on 
A0 =[G ~PNN:p 
e G , G is directed not disjoint to any .geN,~cP 
predense ~ such that it depends on the isomorphism type of N only. Let 
N V/col =~. 
The filter will be generated by: for n < w, 7/ an co-sequence converging to

There an application of this to a problem of Hajnal and Mate of colouring 
number of graphs is given. 
Proof: Easy. 
Application E: Fleissner showed:

For a definition of the topological statement A see after Application F. 
Clearly we can choose # as he asked and by C it satisfies the conclusion. 
So Axiom II ==~ not (topological statement) and Axiom II is consistent with 
ZFC + G.C.H., so 
Conclusion: G.C.H. =~e> (topological statement A ) (again Consis (ZFC) 
suffice). 
Application F: Fleissner asks for the consistency of the following with 
G.C.H. 
(*E) there is a special Aronszajn tree T, T t = It 9 T : ht(t) limit } (where ht(t) 
is the level or height of t) such that: 

244 
(u 
--* ~)[(u 
c Tt)(2x < t)(Vy)[x < y < t -* f(y) -- f (t)] 
(:~g : 7 -~ ~)(V t c Tt)(:az < t)('Cy)[x < y < t -, f (x) <- g (y) -< g (x)]]. 
(this is sufficient for the existence of some example in general topology, see 
end of the application). 
Again Consis(ZFC) suffices (as claim F10 holds). 
The proof is quite similar to that of Application A, see V. 6.1 , but here we 
have to find g : T -, c0, not from a club of levels but from all of them. 
Let T be an Aronszajn tree and f ": T ~ ~ be such that: 
(vt c Tt)(~= < t)(Vy)(t < y < = ~ f*(y) _< f "(t))

We order F by

A generic subset of F gives g as required, but it is not necessarily t~ 1- 
complete and may collapse ~1, or add reals. 
So what do we do? We add obligations.

So we can find

We let C t= C N [~'],Bt=B, 
Now we define g', (and (g', ct,B) >- (g, C,D) c ~ 
will exemplify the desired 
conclusion). 
The non-trivial part in defining g' is for Definition (F3)(c). 
There the 
non-trivial case is 16=i(g),9,=~. 
So for each

a c C(I) N C, a c (T=) re(l) Fl I and (g,C) which is /-very good for a, we have

Let I(I~,ak,~tc ) " k < w] be a list of all triples as above. As (g,C) is I~-very

Easy. This contradicts the definition of I.

the form that appears in F7. We can eontixiue by F7; in order that in the end 
we get a condition we have two kinds of tasks: 
A) for everyt

good for g, and /c < ~ we want that there will be k pairwise disjoint 
bn E (Ta) m N I, so that (Ugn,uCn) will be/-good for bm. 
(As we do this eventually for every/c, we can get ~0 pairwise disjoint b's) 
this is again quite easy. 
We have only ~0 tasks, so there is no problem. 
2) Similar proof. 
Claim: P/, is [~-complete for I~ a simple ~l-completeness system.

Discussion: 1) 
The proof here is appropriate for Application A; the 
small gain is that we directly find a function specializing T rather than do it 
on a closed unbounded set of levels and then use a theorem saying this is 

251 
equivalent. 
2) In Application A, compared to Jensen's Consis(ZFC + G.C.H. + SH ) we 
can get also Consis(ZFC + CH + SH + 2 ~I anything of cofinality :>~1) using 
Lemrna 1.3, and iterating r 2 times, each time specializing all Aronszajn trees. 
The same proof works for the relevant cases. 
3) ~2eissner Question It is unknown whether ZFC [- there is a countably 
paracompact not normal Moore space. 
(Equivalently, there is a countably paracompact not hereditarily countably 
paracompact Moore space). 
Such spaces can be constructed by Wager technique from normal non- 
metrizable Moore spaces. 
In application E the first example of such a space not constructed in this 
way. 
Application F show it can even be a Jones road space - a more traditional 
space than the space constructed in w E. 
Application G: There is no Kurepa tree. Moreover every bl 1 -tree (a tree 
of height r 
with countable levels ) is essentially specialized, i.e. 
there is 
f : T -* ~ (rationals) such that: t --< s ==~ f (t) -- f (s), 
and t ~ sl,t <s2, f (t) = f (sl) = f (sa) ==~ (s 1 < s a or s 2 < sl) (on any ~l 
-branch 
B, f 
is 
eventually 
constant, 
so 
choose 
minimal 
x EB, 
f tlY c B:y ~ x } is constant, call it x (J~?). Then 
B1 # I72 ~I -branches ==~x(B1) # x(B2), so T has <~1 branches). 
Remark: Here Con(ZFC + :t inaccessible ) is sufficient (and necessary). 
Proof: First let P0 be a Levi collapse of t~ a to I~ 1 (which is l~l-complete ). 
In Y p by Silver 
T has <-~l ~l -branches (the argument is not hard). 
Let 
|Bi:i < ~l} be a list of the ~1- branches of ~, w.l.o.g, they are pairwise disjoint 

252 
(choose B, ? ~ B~ end segment by induction). 
Now Q is a forcing (in V P) which specializes T as in Application A, but on each 
B~ the function is constant. The proof is the same. 
So P 
* Q specializes 
T and so guarantees it has 
<~I 1 branches; and a 
directed G C P 
* Q define the function f 
which specializes T if it meets I~ 1 
dense sets: 
(~Dt = |p:p I~-"f(t) 
=q " forsomeq 
e QI fort e T). 
So by Axiom II there is G as required, provided that P * Q is (<<~%) -proper 
and [~-complete for a simple Sl-completeness system [~. 
For properness: P obviously is, Q - as in Application A, (in V P) and so by Ill 
3.2. P # Q is; and for D-completeness - check. 
History for G: Baumgartner Malitz Reinhart [BMR] prove MA + ~ CH ==~ 
every Aronszajn tree is special. 
Silver proves that by Levi collapsing ~ -first inaccessible there is no 
Kurepa tree (this includes the lemma we quote). 
Devlin proved: Consis(ZFC + MA + 2 I% = l~ 2 § no Kurepa tree). 
Shelah [Sh 78b] used essential specialization function like to the above and 
shows we can use l~ 1 - c.c. forcings to essentially specializes l~:- trees with few 
branches (the proof uses more particularly unnecessary information). 
Baumgartner [B3], using proper forcing , defines essentially specialization 
and strengthens Devlin's result to: 
Consi (ZFC + MA + every tree of power l~ 1 and height l~ 1 is essentially spe- 
cial). 

253 
Independently, 
Todorecevic proved these results too. 
It is well known that for such a consistency result an inaccessible cardinal is 
necessary. 
Application H: Assume Axiom II [S]. For ~ -E S 1 let ~/~ be an ~-sequence 
converging to 6 . Then ~7~:5 ~ S t 
has the R 0 -uniformization property. 
See [Sh 77], which should be an exercise to a reader who arrive here. 
w Application of Axiom I 
4.1. Claim" p is proper and even a - proper for every a < co 1 if at least 
one of the following holds: 
1. P satisfies the bl 1 -c.c. 
2. P is 1~ 1 -complete (then PP is even strongly proper, 
~-bounding) 
3. P is Sacks forcing, or Silver forcing, or Gregorief forcing, or product 
with countable support of such forcings (then P is even strongly proper ~ 
- 
bounding 
) for definitions Lemma VI 2.14(2); Remark VI 4.1A; Definition VI 
4.1 (1) and VI 4.1A, Definition IX 2.6, Definition V 4.1 respectively). 
4. P is Laver forcing (see Definition Lemma VI 2.14(3)). 
Proof: An Exercise. 
4.2. Discussion: 
Baumgartner 
[B3] introduces 
condition 
A 
defined 
below. His reason for inventing it, is that it covers a large part of the applica- 
tion of proper forcing, but seemed easier to handle. 
P satisfies condition A if there are partial order ~ 
on P such that: 
i) s 0 is the usual order 
ii) x --<~+I Y --> x ---~ y 
iii) if/k x~ ~ 
zn+ I then Ix~ : ~z < ~] has an upper bound 
iv) if T is a name of an ordinal, p E P,~ < ~, there are q E P,p ~ 
q and

countable A C ord,A c V such that q ]]_n "T c A " 
He proved "P satisfy A ~ 
P proper "; in fact "P satisfy A ~ 
P is (<<c01) 
-proper ': 
4.3. Discussion: Baurngartner [B3] finds many applications for proper 
forcing: new ones and simplified proofs for old ones. See proofs there. 
It is a matter of taste whether to deduce them from Axiom I, or build a forc- 
ing doing it. Some of them are: 
4.13A) Pa, the forcing giving finite information on the enumeration of a 
closed unbounded set, is proper 
Remark: But not r -proper, so this shows proper ~ c0-proper. 
This club does not include any old infinite set. So if we iterate co 2 times 
(by Axiom I or any variant) for any II 1 infinite subsets of c0 z there is a club not 
including any of them. So this statement is consistent with L ~~ = 112. In fact 
~1~0 can be anything, as if P~8 is the forcing for doing it, its product with 
adding ~ Cohen generic is also O.K. 
U. Avraham proves the consistency of a similar assertion to S2 (with CH). 
4.:] B) Every tree of height ~z of power ~z is essentially special. 
See w Application G, here the forcing specializing T consists of finite 
information: but the first part is the same (see history there). 
4.3 C) Consis(ZFC + no H2-Aronszajn tree) (originally proved by Mitchel 
and Silver) and other results of Mitchell [Mi]. We use ~ weakly compact.

5.1 Example: If we iterate forcing not destroying stationary subsets of 
w 1 we may destroy ~ 1. 
Proof: For every a < ~02, let a :

continuous in i , ha(i ) = the order type of A~ a. 
et D = Dr1 (the filter of closed unbounded subsets of ~1)

Then a < fl ==> h a <D ht~- 
(*) Suppose (Va < ~2)[ha <D g] for some g : ~l -* ~1 (g exists e.g., if 
V=L). 
Define 
Pg = 
h a function from some i < ~1 to e01 , i successor; s a

We call i the domain of the condition. 
The partial ordering is obvious . Pg is not necessarily S 1-closed. 
Fact A: CH Pg satisfies the Sa-chain condition.

Fact B: Forcing with Pg does not destroy stationary subsets of ~1.

1.P.. Remark: The reason for including this is as follows. It was a result 
of the work on proper forcing that we can iterate Hi-complete and Hl-c.e. 
forcings together. 
So it was natural to ask the parallel for H 2- complete , 
[Hi-complete with the H~-c.c. ]. But we do not know to iterate the second kind 
alone, so it is reasonable to replace H2-c.c. by something stronger (here - 4 of 
the lemma). (remember p,~(2fl) is ~b when 2g ~ Domp, ~, and h2p(~b ) = 0) 
Of course much better 
would be to find one condition unifying the two 

261 
conditions. 
However as the interaction has no applications now, we shall not discuss 
it further (there are various analogs: see [Sh 78a]). 
Note also the analog lemma for t~l-complete, t~l-c.c, forcing holds, but now 
it has no application. 
1.3 Remark: If ~ 
holds, then in 1.1. we can change the iteration to

Similarly 
we

Also 
C=~@<r

is closed unbounded, so S 1=S N Cis sta-

dual constants) and r > 2 t%, and the number of isomorphism types of such 
models is 2 ~~ so for some i < j there is an isomorphism h:N~ -* N~ (onto), 
h(p~) =p$,h r B = the identity. Now apply Definition 2.1. for N~,N$,h,p~.

satisfies the r-chain condition, provided that 
Proof: a) as a0 < r, Ni N a0 = Nj N a0, (read Definition 2.1. ) and the 
proof is similar to the proof of properness. 
Let ~H(7),<,c~, h,i,j be as 
required. 
We prove by induction on ~ ~ a 0 that for every f < ~, and p 9 N~, qr 9 Pr

For ~ successor, we first by the induction hypothesis define q~-I as 
required; then notice that by the hypothesis , if we force P~-I and get 
G$_ 1 C P~-I generic and q$-1 is in the generic set, h is still an isomorphism 

264 
etc., so we can use the x-p.i.c, on Q~_I[Gt_I]. 
For cf ~ = Ir 0' we work as in properness using the induction hypothesis. 
Noticing that ql[[-"(Yr c P$) (r ~ G 
iff h(r) c G)" make no problem in the 
limit we do not have to take special care. 
For cf/: > ~1 the proof is similar but easier. 
b) Trivial by (a) and 2.3 and the proof of lII 4.1. 
2.5. Lemma: If P is proper, g > [ P ] then P satisfies the g-p.i.c. 
Proof: Remember P C N~ N Nj. In (H(]k,<h,C) there is a first one-to- 
one function g from I PI onto P, so g c Ni n Nj, and IF[ cN~ N N/ so by the 
assumption on Nr 
from Definition 2.1, I P ] < i,j 
, N~ N IF[ = M N ]P ], 
so (using the function g) N~ n P = Nj N P and so h is the identity on P N N~, 
so we can use properness to define q. 
2.6 Definition: The x-p.i,c* is define similarly but we add one assump- 
tion: for any a eNi there is a sequence (aa:a<J:> 
in Ni AN/ 
such that 
a~ = a (this implies the corresponding condition on Nj); equivalently N~ is the 
Skolem hull of (Ni N Ni) U i i] , and N/ is the Skolem Hull of (Ni N N/) (J [J]. 
2.7. Lemma: 1) The ~-p.i.c. implies the ~-p.i.c*. 
2) Lemma 2.2. - 2.5 holds for ~-p.i.c*, 
3) P satisfies the ~-p.i.c ~ if P satisfies the condition from [Sh 
78a] which are: 
a) P is ~vcomplete: ifpn <Pn§ 
then there is q,/N q mPn 
b) for any Pi c P(i < ~) there are pi t ~ P,p~ ":pi t and pressing down 
functions Fn:x -- [0| ~ ~, (i.e., 
Fn(a ) < a) such that: 
if i < j,AF~(i) 
= F~(j) then p~tp] has a least upper bound (in the forc- 
ing) p, ? ^p]. 

265 
2.7A Remark: So 2.7(2) (3), 2.4", 2.3* give an alternative proof of [Sh 
78a], for the case a 0 <- ~. In fact, 2.4*, holds for a 0 not necessarily < ~, when 
each Q is I~ ~- complete, and this gives an alternative axiom for [Sh 78a]. 
~r 
Proof: 1) Trivial. 
2) The least trival part is 2.3. Here the extra assumption is not obvious. 
So we define N#(k <~):for~ 
=0 
p,i r 
~162 
, IIN~

we define by induction, let ~ 
= <a~e : e < ~>, N# e N~ +l <<H(k),<~,e>, 
ll/V~+lll =Mo, and<<a]. , : j <m> : e <~> 6N: +I. 
Now let Ni = IJ Ni ~ and proceed as in 2.3. 
kr162 
3) Let N~,Nj,h be as in the definition of ~-p.i.c*, p e Ni. Let < Jn :n < ~> 
be a list of all maximal antichains of P which belongs to Nr 
For every a e Nt 
let secla e N~ CI Nj be a sequence of length ~ such that a = seqa(i ). We define 
by induction Pn: 
Po=p 
if p~ 
is defined, choose P2n+l ~-P2n,P~+l e P I~ Ni, P2~+I ~ 
{some 
q. eJ.) 
if Pzn+l is defined: consider seq~.l = <v, 
: a < ~>. 
We can assume 
w.l.o.g. 
(Va<~) 
r, eP. 
So there are <F n : n <~>, 
<rt 
: a<~> 
as 
mentioned in e.7(b). As <ra 
: a<~> 
eN~ NNj <x a well ordering, we can 
assume 
that 
<ra ? :a<~> 
eNr NNj. 
Let 
p2n+2=rit 
{remember 
P2,+1 = rt < rtt). 
Notice 
that 
h(vi) = rj, 
and 
by 
the 
choice 
of 
N~,Nj /~ Fn(i) = F,(j). So vii =p2n+~.vi t = h(pen+e ) have a least upper bound 
qen+e = P2n+z ^ h(P2n+~). 
In the end: 
p2~p4<p6< 
. . . 
h(p2) ~ h(p 4) <- h(P6) <--

Now q2~§ ~ q2n§ as they are Least upper bounds. So by t~l-completeness 
there is q,/~ q k qa. Now q is as required.

2.8. Lemma : All the forcings used in VII, w ( = application of Axiom II) 
satisfies the ~2-p.i.c*, and even any product with countable support of any 
number of such forcing (for simplicity of one kind) satisfies the ~2-p.i.c*, and 
in fact are all (<<wl)-proper 
and [~-complete for a simple ~0-completeness 
system [~. 
Proof: Left to the reader - standard. 
Remark: I do not investigate the connection between ~ -p.i.c., and ~- 
e.c.c. However ~-e.c.c. was introduced to deal with the case we iterate forcing 
which are G-complete for some [~. We introduce the ~-p.i.c. , to deal with the 
case we want to get V ~,2 = 2"~ < L~I- On the other hand ~-p.i.c*., seems to 
replace ~-p.i.c. totally. 
Note that 
~-picness essentially (but seemingly not formally ) implies 
properness.

Proof: Trivial. 
w The AXIOMS Revisited 
3.1. Thesis: Proper 
forcing is efficient for getting models in which 
L~~ 
and getting there that " for every A c ~1 "'" ". The reason is that 
we, at present, can iterate only ~2 times without collapsing "2. So we have a 
division to four main cases: 
I) 2 "~ 
2"' =.2 
II) e"0 = .~,2"' = .~ 
III) 2 "o = "2 < 2~' 

267 
Iv) 2 ~ = ~1,~ 1 > "2 
3.2. Discussion: We have dealt in VII w with I), II), and have appropriate 
axioms. Also in previous works mainly I), II) were dealt with; sometimes we 
get more for free, e.g. in Laver ILl] (consistency of Borel conjecture), the 
value of 2' was immaterial. 
For getting such models with some extra properties we iterate co~ times. 
At some stages we blow 2 ~I, or add few reals (and preserve CH meanwhile, see 
2.9) (according to the case - for I, III we add each time few reals, for IV we 
start by adding many A C ~1): At other stages (for I and II) we consider A ~ ~1 
and force "for" "him" some B. If we want III or IV, we consider all A ~ ~1 of a 
certain kind and simultaneously add for each such A appropriate B. Some- 
times we want that the forcing preserve something (e.g. ~0U-boundedness, or 
a Ramsey ultrafilter etc.) but we shall not deal with those things here, for the 
number of axioms arising is not bounded. 
For other possibilities of 2~~ I~1 the situation is not clear. On some con- 
sistency results see Avraham and Shelah [AS], we get there results with 
2~" > ~2 but the results are on A ~ e01: we shall discuss this later. 
Generally, for getting the consistency of stronger axioms we have to 
assume the consistency of ZFC+ some large cardinal. Here we concentrate on 
assuming the consistency of ZFC only.

Lore on forcing not adding ~-

whereas in XIV, w it is shown that 
GH~ 
@ . But Axiom II does not prove 

270 
3 
the consistency of " not 
@ "with CH. More generally we can ask whether we 
can make the condition on the Qa (in V 7.1 , 7.2 ) weaker. 
We see no point in trying hard to weaken the assumption "a-proper for 
every a < ~1" to e.g. ~-proper, as it seemed to me that every natural example 
of forcing will satisfy it (truely, sometimes we want to destroy some station- 
ary subsets of ~1 and under reasonable conditions we can succeed, see work 
on the consistency of " the closed unbounded filter on ~t is precipitious '~see 
Jech Magidor Mitchel and Prikry [JM MP]) but we can amalgamate such proof 
with our constructions). 
The severe point seems [~-completeness; where 
[~ c V or [~ is simple again do not seem serious obstacles to anything; but the 
requirement that any finitely many possibilities are compatible (i.e. [~N,p,p~ 
generate a filter) seemed an obstacle - e.g. to the natural forcing for making 
3 
~, false. Remember [~N.-.-~ WaS a family of subsets of p(g) with the finite 
intersection property. We shall try to replace it by: the intersection of any 
3 
two is non-empty. As application we get consistency of variants of 
@ : we 
hope there will be more. Note that we replace here [~N,p@~ by another 
equivalent formulation. 
Note another drawback, which at present is asthetical only: the [~- com- 
pleteness is not preserved; i.e. we have not found a natural condition, 
preserved by CS iterations, and implying no ~-sequence of ordinals is added. 
Note that we do not use the full generality of Definition 4.1. 
For another point of view, and more results see [Sh 198?d].

4.12 Conclusion: G.C.H. =~ ~.

Q

2) We can in 4.5 just demand: 
each Q is T-proper for every 7 < c01, and ~a-complete for some almost

simple 2-completeness system over V.

SPE- 
CIAL" 
Abstract: We prove that the Souslin Hypothesis does not imply "every 
Aronszajn tree is special". For this end we introduce variants of the notion 
"special Aronszajn tree". We also introduce a limit of forcings bigger than the 
inverse limit, and prove it preserves properness and related notions not less 
than inverse limit, and the proof is easier in some respects. We can get away 
without using it, but I want to represent it somewhere.

Free limits 
1.1 Discussion and Definitions. For A a set of propositional variables, 
a regular cardinal, then: Lx(A) is the set of propositional sentences generated 
from A, by negation and conjunction and disjunctions on sets of power < X . 
Let L~(A) : 
U Lx(A) for/z limit cardinal ( > S0) or ~. Let ~,~,~ denote sen- 
tences; @,@ set of sentences. 
We define ( in L| 
[-lb, or ~ [-@ as usual (the rules of the finite case, 
and (~ ~ A 
~, and from ~ ~ 
for i 9 
deduce 
~ }-r 
) and let

Always ~- means in L.(A) even if we deal with Lx(A ). 
The following is well known. 
1.2 Theorem 
The following are equivalent for ~,~o: 
(1) 9 t- ~; 
(2) there is no model of ~ U |~] 
with truth values in a complete 
Boolean algebra; 

279 
(3) if ~, is such that ]@l, and the power of any set on which we make 
conjunction in some ~ E @ U l~] 
is ~ k, P the collapsing of k to co by finite 
functions, then 
[I-p" there is no model of ~ U | ~o~ ". 
Remark. This can be proven by a small fragment of ZFC, I think admis- 
sibility axioms, at least when we prove only (1) ~ 
(3). Hence (by proving not 
(1) implies not (3)): 
1.3 Conclusion. If A is a transitive admissible set, @,~ ~ A then "@ I- 9" 
has the same truth value in V and in A. 
1.4. Definition. For given A and ~ c L,(A), let FFx('~ ) be I~:~ c Lx(A), 
~ ~ @] 
partially ordered by 
@1 < @2 if ~ I-~1. 
(FF denotes free-forcing; we can identify ~o,@ if ~ ~ @ ~ ~.) 
Reversing the definition of < and adding a minimal element, we get a 
Boolean algebra in which every set of < ), elements has a least upper bound 
provided we identify lb1,@2 when ~ ~- @1 ~ ~b2-

Let Pr

infinite regular cardinal). Then their ~-free limit (F liro~XPr is FFx(A_@[Pr )

But \/a

~cl 
some a ~ .9 is true. So after some forcing, there is a model of ~ ^ a,/~@[Pi],

(a) Let a,b c P~, if they are compatible in Pc, for some c c P~, 
a < c, b < e, and this clearly holds in P$ by its definition. 
If they are incompatible in Pc then a -* ~ b appears as a conjunct in 
~[Pc] and we can finish. Similarly for a,b c Pc, a ~ b in Pc implies a ~ b in 
PS- 
1.9 Remark: We can change the definition of FF~(@) (hence of F lim) by 
changing }-. The natural way is to let K be a class of complete Boolean alge- 
bras, and @ ~-K ~ iff any Boolean valued model of cb is a Boolean valued model 
of

that

Preservation by free limit 
2.1. Theorem_ If each Pi(i < 6) is proper as well as Pj/P~.(i < j < 6) 
then their ~l-free limit P = F lirr~4~ P~ is proper. Also P/P~ is proper. 
Remark: Similarly for/z-proper by [Sh 80 ] terminology if we take p§ 
free limit. We can restrict ourselves to non-limit i,j. 
Proof: Let N-< (H(x),9 
, < Pi:i < 6> 9 N 
,X big enough (see III ). Let 
I~qn:n < c0] be a list of all predense subsets of P which belong to N. We have 
to prove p ^/N ( 
N/ 
a) 9 P (in Boolean algebras terms: is not zero) (p 
n 
aENNL In 
any member of P n N). 
Now assume w.l.o.g, that everything is in some countable transitive model 
M. In the true world Vwe can find a n < an+l,6 n N = Ua n. 
Let r 
< ca> be a list of all countable (in M) subsets of P which 
belongs to N. 
We now define by induction on n, in V, G n,pn such that: 
(I) G~ c P.., G~ c C~+I, 
(2) G n is Pa -generic for M and G n N N is (Pa,, n N) - generic for N, 
(3) Pn < Pn+t , P = Po , P~ C N N P, 
(4) pn is compatible (in P) with every member of G n , 
(5) P2n+1 is ~ qn for some qn e.~ 
n N, 
(6) eitherp2~+ e [-^ ~n 
or 
Pan+a ~ ~ rn for some r n 9 ~n. 
The proo[ is trivial (provided you know about the composition of forc- 
ings). 
In the end G = C/G~ gives us a model of/~@[Pj] 
(by: members of G are 

282 
true, members of U Pj - G are false ). 
For r eP f~N , r is true in the model iffpn-~r 
for some n (this is 
proved by induction on the complexity of r, (see conditions (4) and (6)). In 
the model qn is true, hence

Remark: Part of the proof is essentially a repetition of the complete- 
ness theorem for L~,,~ (propositional calculus). 
But note that in this proof 
there was no need (as in the ones for inverse limit) to use names. Also, 
almost all previous theorems on preservation hold. 
2.2 Definition. Let Q = <P~,Qr 
~ io> be an ~vfree iteration if: 
(a) P~ is <~-increasing, 
(b) P~+I = P~ * Q, = I<P,q> : P e P~,lP&"q e Q~"], 
<p,q> ~<pt,q?> r 
<pl^[ptI~-pq <qt] ; and we identify p e Pi with 
<p.o>. 
(e) for limit 6,Pa is the ~vfree limit.

i and Flin~0P r if i 0 is a limit ordinal, and we let

2.4. Definition. We say that t~vfree iteration preserves a property if 
whenever each Q~ (in V P~) has it, then so does po. 
2.5. Theorem_ Properness is preserved by t~ vfree iteration.

tions -~ r,r c N N P)- 
The following Definition and Theorem are not really necessary for the rest 
of the paper, but will help in understanding w

2.7 Theorem- Strong properness is preserved by ~l-free iteration.

on a ": i 0 that for any fl < a:

2.8. Claim_ If we iterate r 
oO-bounding forcings it does not 
matter whether we use ~l-free iteration or countable 
support one (in the 
latter we get a dense subset of the first). 
Remark: See [V w 
The parallel of 2.7 for countable support was noted 
by Harrington and the author. 
By the way we note that unlike ~l-c.c. forcing: 
2.9 Example: There are proper forcing P, Q such that P <~ Q but Q/P 
is not proper. 
Proof: We let P0 = 
adding a subset v of ~1 with a condition being a

Aronsz~jn trees: various ways to specialize 
We introduce variants of the notion "special Aronszajn tree" and prove 
some known theorems and some easy ones. 
See Baumgartner, /dalitz and 
Rienhard [B/dR], Baurngartner [B] and also Devlin and Shelah [DS1]. Recall 
3.1 Definition. (1) An e 1 -tree T = (I Tl,<r) is a partially ordered set, 
such that (when no confusion arises, we write < instead of <r and T instead 
of I TI): 
(a) for everyx E T , ~y c T:y <z] is well-ordered, and its order type 
which is denoted by rk (x) = rkr(x), is countable, 
(51 T,, = Ix c T : r/e(x) = a] is countable, # ~b, 
(c) 
if 
rk (x) = rk (y) 
is 
a 
limit 
ordinal 
then 
x =y 
r 
iz:z <z~ = |z:z <y], 
(d) if x c T a , a < fl, then for some y ~ TF,x < y, in fact there are at 
least two distinct such y's. 
If we wave (c) and (d) we call it an almost col-tree; similarly for the other 
definitions. 
(2) A set B C T is a branch it if is totally ordered (hence well ordered) 
and maximal ; it is an a-branch if it has order type a. 
(3) An Aronszajn tree is an tree with no col-branch. 
(4) An ~l-tree is Souslin or ~l-Souslin tree if there is no 
uncountable antichain (= set of pairwise incomparable elements). 
Remark. Condition l(d) is not essential, except to make every Souslin 
tree an Aronszajn tree. 

286 
3.2 Definition. (1) For a set S c ~1 which is unbounded, we call an ~l- 
tree S-special if there is a monotonic increasing function f 
from U Ta to I] 
a~S 
(the rationals), i.e., z < y ~ 
f (z) < f (y). 
(2) A special r 
is an ~l-special ~1- tree (this is the classical 
notion). 
(3) r-special, S-r-special are defined similarly when the function is to I~ 
(the reals). 
(4) We say f 
specializes (S-specialize, etc.). T . We can replace S by a 
function h, Dom h = ~1, 
Rang h = S , h increasing. 
3.3 Definition: For a stationary S c w 1 we call an ~l-tree S-st-special ff 
there is a function f, Domf 
= 
U 
T a, andx 
9 T a~f(z) 
9 
(carte- 
a~s-I01 
sian product) such thatz 
<y ~f(x) 
#f(y) 
when defined. If Sis asetof 
limit ordinals we can assume z c T a ~ 
f (z) 9 a. 
3.4. Clain~ (1) If T is S-special or S-r-special 
iS c ~1 unbounded) or 
S-st-special 
(S C ~1 stationary ) ol-tree then T is an Aronszajn tree but not 
Souslin. Any ~l-Souslin tree is an Aronszajn tree. 
(2) The following implications among properties of ~l-tree holds (where 
S z c S 1 ~ Wl, a(i) ~ S 1 increasing , S 1 = ~a(i):i < ~1{): 
(a) Sl-special ==> S~-special, Sl-special ------> Sl--r-special. 
Sl-~-special ~ 
S2-~r-special, S2-special ==> S2--r-special 
Sl-r-special 
==> $1 (3 |a(i + 1) : i < ~l]-special, 
(b) for $1 
stationary Sl-special ==> Sl-St- special, 
(c) Sl-st-special 
---------> S2-st-special, 
(d) for C C r 
closed unbounded S 1 C~ C-st-special ===> Sl-st-special , 
(e) if (u 
hi(/) ~ ha(i), T is hi-special then T is h2-special. 

287 
Proof. 
Trivial: (1) for S-special, and S-r-special 
- well known, for 
S-st-special by the Fodor theorem. 
(2) Trivial - check. 
Remark: By 2(d) dealing with S-st-special 
we can assume all members 
of S are limit, and so Rang f 
c ~1 in the Definition. 
3.5. Claim. 
(1) T is S-special iff S c ~1 is unbounded 
and there is 
f: U Ta-*co , 
[z <y ^ rio(z) 6 SAr/C(y) e_S----------->f(z) Cf(y)]. 
aES 
(2) T is ~l-st-special 
iff T is special. 
Remark: See Claim 3.11. 
Proof: (1) Well known. 
(2) The "if" part is trivial. 
So 
suppose 
f 
~l-st-specialize

For 
every 
x 9 T, 
let 
K= =it 9 (rio(z) + 1) x~: for no y <-z is f(y)

We now define by induc-

3.6. Claim: (1) Let S c ~1 be unbounded. 
If every Aronszajn tree is S

(21 if every Aronszajn tree is S-r-special 
then every Aronszajn tree is

Now T" is almost an Aronszajn tree; the only missing part is in Definition 
3.1, part (d) (in fact there are at least two distinct such y's). We can add 
more elements so that it becomes an Aronszajn tree, T ~176 
, and if g "" S -spe- 
cializes it, g: T -* O, g ( x ) = g "~ 
x ,a(rkr( x ) ) > ) specializes T. 
(21 By 3.6(1) and 3.4(2) (a). 
3.7. Lemma: (1 / (O~t) There is an r-special Aronszajn tree which is not 
special.

Moreover 
(in

that

(3) (O~1) There is an r-special Aronszajn tree, such that for no 
antichain .9 ~ T is rk (.9) = Ire (x):x e .91 stationary. 
Remark: (1) was proved by Baumgartner [B1]. 
Proof: We define by induction on cx < ~1 the tree (T<a, <1" F T<a ) and 
f:T<~-*t~ , z <y ==~f(z) 
<f(y) 
such that if //<?,<a,

and 
= 9 Ta+l r 
f (x) 9 ~. 

289 
For a = 0, a-successor of successor or a limit, no problem. 
For a + 1 , a limit, we are given antichains ~ 
C T<a(n < co) (by q~ 
9' 
q ) and we can define T<a+l such that

<z 9 T<.., 
f(?]) < f(z) < f(y) + ~. 
Now suppose .9 c T is an antichain (T = 
U T<= defined in the end). Let 
u<~1 
C = [a < co 1 : a 
limit, 
and 
if 
x 9 T<a, ~ > 0, 
and 
there 
is

then there is such y 9 T<a ] be closed 
unbounded (note it suffices to consider e 9 |l/n:n

Now if a e C , 3 n T<a = 3r

Ta = ~ (if yeA, y 9 T~, by (*) |z:z <y] n A,g(0) ~ ~; let z be in it, then 
z < y both in ~q, but .9 is an antichain). 
Now by defining .~g using 0~1 or O~1 we get (1), (2) and (3). (for (2), by 
0~, , we have for each a a partition <J~' : ~z < ca> of T<a to antichains, so 
that for every partition <.~n :~z < co> of T O = T<~ z, for stationarily many

need any hypothesis, 0r

theorem on the existence of special Aronszajn trees of Aronszajn himself.)

There is a special Aronszajn tree T, such that for

Remark: E.g., MA + 2 ~~ > n 1 implies that this fails.

Explanation: Our aim is to get a 
universe in which SH (Souslin 
Hypothesis) holds (i.e., there is no Souslin tree) but not every Aronszajn tree 
is special. 
The question was raised by Baumgartner Malitz and Reinhard 
[BMR], and later independently by U. Avraham, and is natural as, until now, 
the consistency of SH was proved by making every Aronszajn tree special; see 
the proof of Solovay and Tennenbaum 
[ST], Martin and Solovay [MS], 
Baulngartner , Malitz and Reinhard [BMR] without CH, and Jensen proofs in 
Devlin and Johnsbraten [D J] with CH. For this aim we introduce in w various 
notions of specializations (each implying the tree is not Souslin). So the pro- 
gram is to make every tree special in some weaker than usual sense. 
The 
notion r-special which had been introduced by Kurepa [Kr] is not suitable, as 
if 
every 
Aronszajn 
tree 
is 
r-special 
then 
every 
Aronszajn 
tree 
is 
la + l:a < col}-special (See 3.4(a)), hence everly Aronszajn tree is special (see 
3.6). Similary "h-special "' for any fixed increasing h :~1 -" ~ is not suitable by 
3.6 (see Definition 3.2(4)). 

293 
So a natural candidate is "h-special for some h "(i.e., for every tree there 
is an h for which it is h-special). Forcing with Q(T) does the job for T - we 
take generic h and 3"- (It would be more natural to let f go to ~ and be mono- 
tonically increasing, but by 3.5(2) the forcing Q(T) makes T h-special for 
some h, and this way we have more uniformity with Definition 4.3.) So we 
should iterate such forcings, but retain some T as not special. 
A second way is to make each T S-st-special for some fixed stationary 
S; for this Q(T,S) is tailored. (Note that the3" we get from a generic set of 
Q(T,S) has domain 
(J T= where S 1 C S, S - S t non-stationary.) For S = ~b 
--~Sa 
we get the previous ease, so we shall ignore Q(T). 
This leads to a secondary problem: Can every Aronszajn tree be Sl-st- 
special, but some Aronszajn trees are not S2--st-special ( S 2 - S 1 stationary, 
of course)? We answer positively. 
4.4 Claim= For T an Aronszajn tree, S C ~1, Q(T,S) is proper. 
Proof: We can assume w.l.o.g. ] To] = ~0- Let A > (g~'), N ~ <H(A),c>, 
T,S c N, po = (h,f) c Q(T,S) ~ N, and let 6 =: N C~ w1- 
Then 1ol = (h (J I( ~,~> {,f ) e Q( T,S) exemplifies what is required. 
For checking, we really repeat the proof that the standard forcing for 
specializing an Aronszajn tree satisfies the ~ 1-c.c. 
4.5. Definition. We call a forcing P, (T',S)-preserving (do you have a 
better name? ), where T" is an Aronszajn tree, iff for every ~, > (31P1+1%) +, 
<P,T',S) 
c N -~ (H(~,),c) ,N countable, ,~ ~'.N n ~1 ~ S , p ~ N n P, there 
is p 1 which is preserving for (p ,P, T",S); i.e., 
(i)p ":Pl cP, 
(ii) p 1 is (N,P)-generic, 
(iii) for every x ~ T~, if 

294 
(*) z cA -, (:ay < x)(y cA)holds for every A C T',A c N, then 
(**) for every P-name A,A c N such that I]-p A C T* the following holds: 
.Pl I1-"z c A -, (3y <=)y c A". 
4.6. Lemma: If T',T are hronszajn trees, S ~ ~1, then Q(T,S) is (T',S)- 
preserving. 
Remark: If T ~ is Souslin tree then (*) from Definition 4.5 is satisfied by 
everyx ~ T~ (this follows by 4.1). 
Proof: 
Let 
N < < H(A),E>, 
5 ~-:N A ~, g S, 
II N II = "o, 
(T*,T,S> E N,p = (h0,f0) E P N N (as in Definition 4.5.), and (remembering

Definepl = (h0 U [( 6,6 "> {,f 0) and suppose z c T~ and 
(*)irA c T* , A EN , x <A then(2y)(y <x ^y cA). 
Let A be a Q(T,S)-name of a subset of T*,A c N. 
We 
shall 
prove 
that 
for

for

h~ = h a t ~, h~ = h a t [5,~1) (closed open interval ) and 
.f~ =f~l" T<n, fe

Note that by the definition of Q(T,S): 

Fact: (1) p~ 9 P (5 N, 
(2) z 9 
~----->rlc(z)~ 6*. 
295 
Now let a 0 = Max Rang h~ ( which is < 6) and we define a function F 
DomF = [y 9 T':rk(y) > ao], 
F(y) = ~p 
|a ~ < aOl: there is (*h~ ,~ b) (in Q(T,S)) such that: 
(1) Min(Dom "h2 b ) = rk (y), 
(2) *h~ (r~ (y)) = ~ ", 
(3) (h~ U *h~J~ U *f~) II-~(r.s)"V c A'I 
*hb ~a 
(SO we demand also that (h~ U 
'"z,Ja U *f~) is in Q(T,S)). 
Now clearly F e: N (as it is defined by a (first-order) formula in (H(A),E) 
whose parameters 
are in N). 
Clearly F(y)':ca 1 (for y 9 T ~ 
T ~

Let 
A~ 
9 T~ 
> a0, F(y)=c~ll. (Note that A~ 
T ~ is a set, not a P- 
name of a set. ). 
Let F ~ be a function from ~1 to wz defined by: 
F~

As ] T~= I < t~0, F~

By the definition of 6", F*(6) < 6*. But (h~,fb) exemplify F(z) -~ 6 ~ so 
necessarily F(x) = ~1. So by definition z c A *. Hence by the hypothesis (*) 
there isy <r'x

Q(T,S) then 
For i < 6 letp~ 
(h~ U h2 U "~'2" ,J 2 U f 2 U f

by (3)' it is as required. 
Why can p~ be not in Q(T,S)? The first coordinate (h~ t.J he U h2 b'i) is 
O.K., as he b'~ c N. 
What about the second? 
Note that f~ u f2,f~ u fz,., 
are O.K. as 
Pz E Q(T,S) and by (3)' above correspondingly. Hence the only danger is that 
there 
are 
z l~Domf2 b , zzcDomf~ 
,i, 
z 2 <rZl 
(as 
f~,~ eN, 
rk (z 1) >- hbz (~) = 6" this is the only bad possibility ). 
But remember that in H(k) z cDomf~ ,i ~rk 
(z)~_ i, so by a lemrna 
on Aronszajn trees due to Baumgartner, Malitz and Reinhart (in their proof of 
[via ~- "' every Aronszajn tree is special '1 which appears in the proof of IIl 5.4. 
there is a sequence <~:i < ~>(i n < ~I) such that

So again there is such a sequence in N, and all but at most ]Domf~l 
are 
O.K., i.e., p~ c Q(T,S). So we finish. 
4.7. Theorem," Let T ~ be a Souslin tree. Suppose Pa(a ~ ao), Qa(a < ao) 
9 
~t 
form an t~l-free iteration (i.e., P=+I = Pa * Q=, P~ = F lima<a0 Pa) and for

(a) Q= is (in V Pffi) (T*,S)- preserving,

there

Qa = Qaub( ~ - Sa) = [g: for some i < wl,Domg = i + 1,Rang(g) = 10,1], 
[j ~i:g(i) = 1] is closed and is C~l-Sa], 
Then Pa0 is ( T*,S)-preserving. 

297 
Remark: We can amalgamate conditions (a) and (fl) but it has no use. 
Proof: We prove by induction on a the following: 
O a 
Suppose

deal 
with

/9 r B 
is

projection). 
Moreover, 
ff 
p r fl ___/9? ~ Pan 
N, then ql,p ? are compatible; 
(ii) ql is (Pp,N)-generic, 
(iii)if x c T~ and (YA c T*)(A cN^x 
EA --*(ay <x)y ~A) 
then for 
very Pa-name A ~ N, ql ]l-pp "x r A -~ (By <r" x)y c A". 
Then there is 101 E Pet such that 
(i)' 
P z r p = q 1(natural 
meaning) 
and 
p ~ p ? c Pa f~ N, 
ql <- q? c Pp ; qt,pt r IJ compatible implies pt,pt,qt are compatible (= has an 
upper bound), 
(ii)'/9 1 is (N,Pa)-generic, 
(iii)' the parallel of (iii) with p -* a 
, 
q 1 -~ P 1- 
Case 1 : et --- 0. Trivial. 
Case 2: a + 1. By the similarity between the assumptions on q 1 and the 
conclusion on p 1, we can assume w.l.o.g. ~ = a. Let G c Pa be generic q t c G. 
Then N[G] -< (H(A)W-) (see III 2.11). 
Now in V[G] (hence in H(A)[G]) we can find p~ ~- p(a),(N[G],Qm[GJ)- 
generic, as in Definition 4.5. Why? 
Note that we can ignore the second phrase of (i)' , as we can take a dis- 
junction over countably many possibilities one for each r e N[G], r m p (a). 
More accurately, maybe in Q. it does not exist, but we can make a trivial 
change in Q= to ensure it, without affecting the iteration (in fact, the forcing 

298 
we use has such a condition anyway). 
Now our proof splits according to which of the conditions (a) or (8) from 
the theorem, Q [G] satisfies. 
(a) Straightforward, by 4.6. 
(8) 
By the 
choice 
of 
T ~ (Souslin) 
by Claim .4.1, 
x 9 
9 
and 
x 9 T~ ==~ (:ly < x)y 9 A. 
So 
by 
the 
assumption 
on 
ql 
for 
every 
A 9 V[G] , A c T', 
A 9 
of 
course 
there 
is 
a 
Pa-name 
A 
so 
ql [~-e,, "x 9 A --, (3y < x)y 9 A'" hence in 
V[G],x 9 A 1"3 T~ ~ 
(~y < x)y 9 A. 
In 
particular, 
we 
can 
take 
A =•cN[G] 
(remember 
~gaE V P" 
<o0j:j <a> 
oN). 
So clearly if x 9 T~ f3-ga thenx 
9 
implies.ga is not an 
antichain, contradiction. 
So T~ N Ja = r 
so 6 g S. = rk (Ja), and then the 
desired conclusion is quite easy (remember Qa's definition). 
So we have p~ as required, p~ is in VP% so in V we have a Pa-name pt for 
it , and let p 1 = (q 1,P~) 9 Pa * O which by the usual thing for composition of 
N~t

We shall find G ~ Pa such that G N PP% is generic (for M,Pa~ ), and the 
truth values it gives to allp c 
U Pa,, make Pl Apt true (so we have, in V, a 
model exemplifying A 
@[P~] i, L - ~1 Apt) (= faet (A)), and G 1 C G. 
As for fact (B), fact (B) (ii)' holds trivially by the definition of P l (i.e., 
]~ (\/r)). 
Similarly the last conjunct takes care of (B) (iii)'. 
rE.~ 
The second phrase of (B) (i)' holds by the free choice of pt,qt (and the 
way Ga,,G are chosen), hence p 1 t fl = q 1; the other inequality follows by p l's 
definition. 

300 
We define by induction G n,pn such that (like 2,2): 
(1) an c P=.,a~ c a.+1, 
(2) G n is Pa -generic for M, 
(3) Pn <P~+l

or q3~+3 ^/k~r 
ll-e="z ~ A " for 
some fl, such that ~ - |P3n+3] c Gn+z2 definable in (N, ly :y <r" zn|). 
As in the proof of 2.2., this suffices. 
The only non-trivial part in the 
definition is taking care of (8). So let n = 3/c + 2 , pn , Gn, be defined, and 
we shall define Pn+l,Gn+l- We define 
A t = ~y e T': 
--k 
there 
is 
r 9 Pa , v > Pn, 
which

However the inverse implication does not follow. Now if we can choose Pn+i, 
such that p~ ~P,~§ e: Pa N N , P~+l compatible with every member of G n 
(equivalently of G n N N) such that .Pn+i ]]-P="Y e A " for some y <r" x., 
then we can proceed to define Gn+ 1 with no problem. 

301 
We assume that there is no suchpn+l and letPn+a =Pn. Let

Clearly ~ is definable in ( g, ly :y < T'X~ I), ~ C f a 0 N, and ~ C lPn l LI G,~ , so it

There is no problem to define Gn+ 1, so we finish proving (8) hence the 
theorem. 
4.8. Conclusion: If ZFC is consistent so is : ZFC + every Aronszajn tree is 
S-st-special 
, but some Aronszajn tree T ~ is not S'-st-special 
for any 
S* C col- S stationary (S is co-stationary - otherwise it is not interesting, 
but there is no other restriction). 
Proof: Trivial by the previous Theorem 4.6, 4.7, but note that for ensur- 
ing T" remains an Aronszajn tree we had better start the iterated forcing by 
Q(T,S), as for the ll~-chain condition, see VIII w 
Remember also that our 
forcings are proper and proper forcings preserves stationarity of subset of ca a 

302 
(see III). 
Concluding Remarks: (1) We can ask: can we do it with G.C.H. and can 
we get independence of other variants of "every Aronszajn tree is non- 
Souslin, special, etc." but we have not tried. For G.C.H. it is natural to use a 
variant of the forcing used in V w 
for the consistency of G.C.H. + SH with 
ZFC. 
(2) By the definition of the forcing Q(T,S); and by 3.5(2) (applied to an 
almost subtree), in 4.8 we get that every Aronszajn tree is st- special for some 
S t (the range of the generic h). So for S empty, we get: every Aronszajn tree 
is St-special for some St (equivalently h-special for some h:c01 -* ~1) but some 
tree is not S'-st-special for any stationary S" c ~1. 
(3) If we use also case (fl) in 4.7,we can strengthen the conclusion of 4.8 
to: for no antichain ,9C T" is r~(.9)- S stationary (by adding a closed 
unbounded subset of ~1 disjoint to any such rk (.9) - S). 
(4) Avraham noted that "T is h-special for some h " is equivalent to "T 
is S-r-special for some closed unbounded S C ~1"'. Note that we can define 
S-P-special 
for 
every partial 
order 
P, 
and 
if a~ e P(i <c~1) implies 
(3i < j < cot) a~ -- aj then "T S-P-special "implies "T is not Souslin "'. Note 
also that "S--r-special for some closed unbounded S" implies c~1--I~ x O- 
special [ R- reals, ~-rationals, the order -lexicographic). So we have proved, 
e.g., "every Aronszajn tree is ~l-a x l] special" does not imply "every 
Aronszajn tree is special". 
(5) We can also try to get a model of ZFC where, e.g, (1) (for some sta- 
tionary co-stationary S c ~1) every Aronszajn tree is S-st-special, but some 
Aronszajn tree T ~ is not h-special for any S; or (2) there is no Souslin tree 
but some Aronszajn tree is not h-special for any h. For (1) it is natural to 
define Qt(T,S) = |(h,/): 
(h,f) e Q(T,S), Domf c 
U 
Tal. 
But T is the 
h(a) = = 
union of S 0 disjoint copies of T', so Q(T,S) makes T" h -special for some S. 
(6) We can generalize Definition 4.5. 
Let M = <Ma:a < c01~ be a 
sequence of countable models, the universe of M a is 7a, 7a( a < c0,) increasing 
continuous, and let ~o(z,y,U) be a quantifier free formula, where x,y are indi- 
vidual variables. U a monadic predicate. We call a forcing notion (M,~o) - 

303 
preserving if for A large enough and N a countable elemenLary submodel of 
(H(A),c>, P E N@ c N, there is q-~p which is (N,P)-generic and, letting 
6=N N~ol: 
if x ~ Ma+ 1 and (VA c N)('~y ~ Ma)~(x,y,A ) 
then 
q Ibp"(VA c N[G])(uy ~ M~)~(x,y,A ). 

X ON SEMI-PROPER FORCING 
_b_bs~ract: We weaken the notion of proper to semi-proper, so that the 
important properties (e.g., being preserved by some iterations) are preserved 
and it includes some forcing which changes the cofinality of a regular cardi- 
nal >81 to 8 0 . So, using the right iterations, we can iterate such forcing 
without collapsing t~ 1. As a result, we solve the following problems of Fried- 
man, Magidor and Avraham, by proving (modulo large cardinals) the con- 
sistency of the following with G.C.H.: 
(1) for every S ~ t~ 2 , S or S 2 - S contains a closed copy of ~1, 
(2) 
there 
is 
a 
normal 
precipitous 
filter 
D 
on 
I~ 2, 
I~ <~2 : ef 6 =n0| e D, 
(3) 
for 
every A ~t~ 2, 
{~<~2:cf~=t~ 0 , ~ is regular 
in 
L(~ N A)] is stationary. 
Notation: Or~ is the class of ordinals, Car the class of ordinal, ICar the 
class of infinite cardinals, UCar = ICar -lI~0] and RCar the class of infinite 
regular cardinals, SCar = RCar k) |2],

Iterated forcing with RCS (revised countable support) 
Iterated forcing with countable support is widely used. 
One of its 
definitions is that at the limit stage with cofinality I~ 0 we take the inverse 
limit, and at the limit stage with cofinality > 8 0 we take the direct limit. 
Another formulation is given in Definition III 3.1. However, the applications, 
as far as we remember, are for forcing notions which preserve the property 
"the cofinality of $ is uncountable", and in fact are E-proper, for some E. 

305 
However, in our case we are interested just in forcing which does change 
some cofinality to 1~ 0. In such cases, we cannot break the iterated forcing 
into 
an 
initial 
segment 
and 
the 
rest 
(i.e., break <P~,Q :i < a~ 
into 
~r 
<P~,O :i<~ 
and <P~/P~,Q 
:p<i 
<a t. 
The reason is that maybe the 
first forcing changes the cofinality of some /5 , p < ~ < a to ~0; hence P,~/Pp 
is not the inverse limit of ~ P~/P~,O:~. ~ <= i < .~. 
Hence we suggest another iteration, RCS (revised countable support), 
which seems the reasonable solution to this dilemma. 
The essence of the solution is that a name of a condition is really a condi- 
tion. More exactly, in countable support iteration a condition may be q such 
that for some ~ , q is a Pp-name of a member of Q, so q is a name but ~ is a 
"real" ordinal. But we allow ~ to be a name. But a name for which forcing 
notion? We would like to use Pa-names , but then we got a vicious circle, 
defining what is a condition of Pa using Pa-names. So we can allow P?-name 
for some 7<a, 
such that ]l-pT"T<fl<a" 
and then use names of such 
conditions etc. The exact definition appears below; though it has a somewhat 
cumbersome definition, it seemingly conform better to our intuitive idea of 
iteration. 
Remark: (1) Now if P1 = P0 * Q0 ' ql a Pl-name, G o ~ P0 generic, then 
in V[G0] , -ql can be naturally interpreted as a Q0-name, called ql/G o, which 
has a P0-name q / G or ql/Po; but usually we do not care to make those fine 
N1 
N0 
distinctions. 
(e) Using 
Q = <P~,Q. : i < a>, 
Pa will mean 
Raim ~ 
(see 
Definition 1.2). 
(3) If D is a filter on a set J , Dc F, 
Vc Vt (e.g., Vt= F[G]) 
then in an abuse of notation, D will denote also the filter it generates (on J) 
inVt. 

306 
(4) D a is the closed unbounded filter on ~. 
1.1 Definition: We define the following notions by sirnulta~zeous induc- 
tion on a: 
(A) Q = <P~,Q.:i 
< a> is an RCS iteration (RCS stands for revised 
countable support), 
(B) a Q-named ordinal (or [j,a)-ordinal), 
(C) 
a 
Q-named 
condition 
(or 
[j,a)-condition), 
and 
we 
define 
q t 6 , q t [~] for a Q-names [j,a)-condition q and ordinal $. 
(D) the RCS-lirnit of Q , RLim Q which satisfies Psubi ~ RLim Q for 
every i < a. 
(We should write RLim ~0' but omit the t~ 0 as we deal with countable support 
only.) 
(A) We define "Q is an RCS iteration " 
a = 0 : no condition. 
aislimit: 
Q=<Pi,Q 
:i <a> is anRCSiterationiffforeveryfl<a 
, Qtflis 
one. 
a = ~ + 1 : Q is an RCS iteration iff Q r p is one, Pp = RLim (Q r ~) and Q$ 
is a Pp-name of a forcing notions. 
(B) We define "~ is a Q-named [j,a)-ordinal of depth T above r " 
N 
The intended meaning is an (RLim Q)-name of an ordinal of a special 
kind, however RLim Q is still not defined. So we use the part already known. 
For 7 = 0 : "~ is a Q-named [j,a)-ordinal of depth 7 above r "means r is a 
(plain) ordinal in [j,a), i.e., j < ~" < a , r e Pr 

307 
For 7 > 0 : "~ is a Q-named [j,a)-ordinal of depth 7 above r "' means that 
for some fl<a, 
(letting 7 =fl+ 1 <a 
and 7 =fl otherwise r ~P~+I , ~is a 
PT-name of a [max|j ,t~,a)-named ordinal above r, i.e., for some antichain .~, 
predense above r 
, .9 -- [pc :i < i0] C/>7' [7~ : i < isubO] 
and [Zr : i < i0], we 
have: ~ is a Q-named [max~j,~,a)-ordinal 
of depth n above p~,7~ < 7, and 
is ~ if p, and r ( i.e., if p, , r will be in the generic set then ~ will be ~); (this 
is informal but clear). 
Without 7 : We say ~ is a Q-named [j,a)-ordinal above r, if it is such for 
some depth. 
Without r : r = ~b. 
Similarly, we omit "[j,a)--rq when j = O. 
(C) We define "q is a Q-named [j,a)-condition of depth 7 above r "' and 
also q t I~| , q r ~ and the Q-named [j,a)-ordinal r 
associated with ~. 
The definition is similar to (B). 
For 7 = 0 : We say "q is a Q-named [j,a)-condition of depth 7 above r "if 
for some ordinal ~, 
j~<a 
and 
q 
is a 
Pcname 
of a member 
of 
~qi ' v ~ P~§ 
We let 
Lastly we let ~(q) = ~, 
qt$= 
if $<r 
gtlr 
= 
if ~er 

308 
For 7 > 0: We say q is a V-named [j,a)-condition of depth T above r, if for 
some 
V-named 
[j,a)-ordinal 
of 
depth 
7 
above 
r, 
~ 
, 
defined 
by 
. ~p~ 9 i < i0] c 
Pa+l,{7, 
: i < i0], 
|~ : i < i0], 
we 
have 
Q-named 
[max~fl,j],a)-conditions 
of depth 7, above r D P, , q.(i <i0) 
such that 
~(q~) = ~, and q is ~q" ifp~ and r. 
We then let {'(q) = <', and q r ~ is defined similarly replacing q, by q. t ~, 
and lastly q t ~{ is defined similarly replacing qi by qi r |~]. 
We omit 9' and/or "[j ,a)-"if this holds for some 7 and/or j = 0. 
(D) We define RLim Q as follows: 
if et = 0: RLim Q is trivial forcing with just one condition: ~; 
if a 2* 0: we call q an atomic condition of RLim Q, if it is a Q -named con- 
dition. 
The set of conditions in RLim Q is 
|p :p 
a 
countable 
set 
of atomic 
conditions; 
and for every ~ < a, 
p t ~slr 
t~ :r cp] ePa, 
and 
p r~ ]~-pp"p rfl ]~-PI 
"p t |ill ~flr t [fl] : r 9 ] has an upper bound in Q "1. 
~~ 
The order is inclusion. 
Now we have to show P# <o RLim Q ( for fl < a), note that any Q-named 
[j,~)-ordinal (or condition) is a V-named [j,a)-ordinal (or condition), and see 
1.4(1) below. 
Remark: We can obviously define Q-named sets; but for conditions (and 
ordinals for them) we want to avoid the vicious circle of using names which 

309 
are interpreted only after forcing with them below. 
1.2 Definition: (1) Suppose {" is a Q-named [j,a)-ordinal above r

We define

~[G] :~[G] 
(remember 7i < 7). 
If r ~ G 
~[G] is not defined, or we give it a function value, like ~o. 
For a Q-named [j,a)-condition above r 
,q, we define q[G] similarly. 
N 
(Z) For ~ a 0-named [/,a)-ordinal above r, and q c

(3) We define a cannonical Q-names [j,a)-ordinal of depth 7 
above r, as in Definition 1.1 (B), by induction on 7: 
For 7 = O: "r is a ~-named [j,a)-ordernal of depth 7 above r " if r is an 
N 
ordinal in the interval [j ,a) , r c Pj+I if j < a , r c Pj otherwise 
For 7 > O: "~ is a 0-named [j,a)-ordinal of depth 7 above r "if for some 
fl,Ca (letting 7 =fl+ 1 if ~8+ 1 <a

(4) We define a cannonical 0-named [j,a)-condition of depth 7 

310 
above r E-P$+l as in Definition 1.1(c), using only cannonical Q-named ordi- 
nals. 
(5) A cannonical p c RLim Q is a countable set of cannonical 
atomic conditions. 
(6) We omit 7 and/or [j,a) when this holds for some 7 and/or 
] =0 , a=s 
We omitrwhenr 
:p. 
1.3 Claim: (1) If G C 
tJ P~ each G CI P~ generic over V, then for some 
~,+l<a 
r 
= ~ , j -< ~ < ~. Moreover for so~e q c P~+~,q Ib~"r : ~': 
(2) For every Q-named [j,a)-ordinal r of depth 9' there is a can- 
nonical Q-named (j,a)-ordinal ~ of epth ~ 7 such that they are equivalent , 
i.e., for everyq EP7 ' 7+ t <a, and~ 
ql]-~"~ =~''iffql]-~''~ 
=r 
(3) For every q,Q-named [j,a)-condition of depth y, above r 
there is q? , a cannonical V-named [j,a)-condition above r of depth ~ a, 
above r such that they are equivalent, i.e., for every G c 
kJ Pi, each G • P~ 
~+l<j 
generic, q[G] = qt[G]. (if v ~ G, both are not defined). 
(4) The set of cannonical members of RLim V form a predense 
subset, and two compatible members of it have an upper bound in it. 
Proof: (1) The proof is by induction on the depth. 
(2) We prove by induction on the depth 7. If 7 = 0 there is no 
problem. 
Suppose 
7 > 0 
and 
~ 
is 
defined 
by 
beta,7,.~ = IP~ : i < i0~, 
~ 
"i <i0], 
17~ :i <i0]. 
By the 
induction hypothesis 
there 
are 
equivalent to {'.. Let ~. be defined by fli,Ti,I~ = IP~,e : ~ < e~], 
~r

~7~,~ : ~ < e~] (as in Definition 1.1(B)). 
Let J0 = IP~:i <s 
<7] 
U IP~,ei <i0,7~ =7,s<e~], 
and let ~cP7 
be a 

311 
maximal antichain, each member is above r and above some member of ~0 
(hence a unique one as .9 , .9~ are antichains). The rest is clear. 
Now we point out some properties of RCS iteration. 
1.4 Clair~ Let Q = ~ Pi,Q. " i < a~ be an RCS iteration, Pa = RLim Q. 
(1) Ififf<a, thennotonlyP~Pa, 
butifq cPg, 
p cPa, thenq,p are 
compatible iff q ,p r fl are compatible. 
(2) If ~'Z are ~-named [],s (Q))-ordinals, then Max [~,TI( defined 
naturally) is a Q-named [j,e (Q))-ordinal. 
(3) If a = ~ff0 + 1, in Definition 1.1, part (D), in defining the set of 
elements of Pa we can restrict ourselves to p = fl0. Also in such a case, 
Pa = PP0 * Qp0 (essentially). More exactly, |p U |q] : P c Ppo, 
q a P•0-name 
of 
a 
member 
of 
~ Qp0 ] 
is 
a 
dense 
subset 
of 
P=, 
and 
the 
order 
Pl U [ql] __<lP~ U |q2] iffPl __<P2, P2 [~-ql --<ql is equivalent to that of P=, 
i.e., we get the same B.A. 
(4) The following set is dense in P= : |P ~ P=: for every ~ < a, if 
rl,recp,

~~ for limit a. 
(6) If I~-~, "lQ, I <= ~", ~ a cardinal, then IP,§ 
<= 2 w'l + ~. 
Proof: Easy. 
1.5 The Iteration Lemma: 
(1) Suppose F is a function, then for every ordinal a there is RCS-iteration 
= ~P~,Q. : i < at>, such that: 
(a) foreveryi 
, Q = F(Qri), 

312 
(b) at < a, 
(c) either at = a or F(Q) is not an (RLim Q)-name of a forcing notion. 
(2) Suppose fl < a , Gp c P~ is generic, then in V[Gp[, c generic, 
then in I/[G~], 
Q/G~=~Pr 
:~=_<i <a> 
is an RCS-iteration and 
RLim Q = Pp * (RLim Q/G~) (essentially).

and

a 0 = 0, 
RCS-iteration P~(0) = RLim Q, then so are 
and { Pc/Pa(~),Qr : a(~) < i < a(~ + 1)~ ; and 
Proof: 
(1) Easy. 
(2) Pedantically, we should formalize the assertion as follows: 
(*) There is a function F, (= a definable class) such that for every RCS- 
iteration Q, and ~(Q) = a, and ~ < a, 
F0(Q,p) is a Pp-name of O such that: 
a) ]]-Ps "~? is a RCS-iteration of length a-B". 
b) Pp * (RLim ~?) is equivalent to Pa = RLim Q, by FI(Q,fl) (i.e., FI(Q,P)

bras.

N 
w Proper forcing revisited. 
2.1 Discussion: Properness is a property of forcing notions which 
implies that t h is not collapsed by forcing with P, and is preserved by 

314 
countable-support iteration and also ~l-free iteration, see IX.).' In III it was 
introduced, and (see VII w 
many examples of forcing not collapsing ~1 were 
shown to be proper ( #l-complete, C.C.C., Sacks forcing, Laver forcing and 
more ). It was argued that proper forcing is essentially the most general pro- 
perty implying ~1 is not collapsed and preserved under iteration. So the forc- 
ing of shooting a closed unbounded 
set through a stationary subset S of ~1 
(see Baumgartner, Harrington and Kleinberg [BHK] , and III 4.4 ), though not 
collapsing ~1, is excluded as if ~1 = [J Sr,,Sn pairwise disjoint stationary sub- 
sets of I~ 1 and we shoot a closed unbounded subset through each ~1 - Sn, in 
the limit ~1 is collapsed. Of course we can "kill" stationary sets in a fixed nor- 
mal ideal of ~1 (see e.g. [JMMP] ) and properness really demands somewhat 
more than not destroying stationary subsets of 1~ t (also stationary subsets of 
S/80(~ ) = [A c~:[A[-<_~1 
should not be destroyed); 
but those 
seemed 
technical points. 
However, in HI - VIII we were mainly interested in forcing of power ~1, so 
another restriction of properness was ignored: if P is proper, any countable 
set of ordinals in V P is included force in a countable set of V. So forcing 
changing the cofinality of some ~, cf ~, > ~1, to n 0, are not included . In fact, 
there are such forcings which do not collapse H 1, and moreover, do not add 
reals: Prikry forcing [Pr] (which changes the cofinality of a measurable cardi- 
ned to ~0) and Namba [Nm] which change the coflnality of ~ to ~0- 
We suggest here a property of forcing, called semi-properness, such that 
the theorems proved for proper forcing hold (when we use RCS-iteration) and 
it includes Prikry forcing. We do not know whether there is a forcing chang- 
ing the cofinality of ~2 to 1~ 0 which is semi-proper (i.e., provably from ZFC), but 
we shall have an approximation to this. 
So in this section we introduce the notion, and prove the preservation 
under RCS-iteration. In this we weaken a little the assumptions: for limit ~, 
Qa is not necessarily semi-proper, only P6+1/P~+I( i </~) is semi-proper. This 

315 
change does not influence the proof, but is very useful, as we can exploit the 
fact that 6 was a large cardinal in V. Note that the useful result is Corollary 
2.8. 
2.2 Definition: A forcing notion P is S-semi-proper (S a P-name of a 
N 
class of cardinals) if for any large enough regular ~,, and well-ordering < of 
H(~,), and countable N <(H(h),E,<~, 
such that 
P C N, and for every 
p c P C~ N there is q ~ P such that: for every cardinal ~ c N and P-name 
~ N of an element of ~, 
q I~-p"ifcE~SthenthereisA 
oN, ]AI <~ , ~cA 
" 
Equivalently, if S consists of regular cardinals of V, q I~-p 
Sup N N ~ = Sup N(G) C~ r "; this is the main case. 
" if cESthen 
(Note we write A and not A, i.e., A is in V; also when ~ is regular in V. 
w.l.o.g. A = 7 for some T < ~; this is the main case.) 
We 
call 
q, 
under 
such 
circumstances, 
S-semi 
(N,P)-generic. 
If 
S= I~:r = I~1 or in VP,r is a regular cardinal of cofina]ity > ~01 then we omit 
it. 
Remark: We could here change the definition to: 
q I[-p " if x E S V~ N[G] then Sup (N V~ x) = Sup (g[G] N x) 
(in this case every r ~ S is regular > a0)- We have not looked into this vari- 
ant. 
2.3 Claim= (1) If P 
is UCar-semi-proper, or even S-semi-proper, 
S = I~:cf ~, >~0 , ~ a cardinal in V]., then P is proper, and vice versa. 
Moreover q in Definition 2.2 is (N,P)-generic which means: if p ~ N is a P- 
name of an ordinal then q I[-P "~ c N ". 

316 
(2) P is S-semi-proper iff the condition of Definition 2.2 holds for 
some X > 21PI, and well-ordering < iff it holds for X = (21PI) + (provided that 
P E H(X)), and we can wave <. 
(3) P is S-semi-proper iff (B P -[01,>) is, where B p is the com- 
N 
plete Boolean algebra corresponding to P. 
(4) In Definition 2.2, for ~ >e0, and ~ > I PI, the condition is 
trivially satisfied by any q, so only S C~ ~:e0 < ~ <- [ P I ], is relevant. 
(5) If P <o Q, S a P-name, Q 
S-semi-proper then P is S-semi- 
proper. 
Proof: Easy. 
2.4 Definition: (1) A property is preserved by RCS-iteration, provided 
that for any RCS-iteration Q = (P~,Q :i < a>, if O has the property (in V a) 
~/. 
~i 
for each i , then RLim Q has the property. 
(3) A property is strongly preserved by RCS-iteration provided 
that if Q = < Pi,Qi:i < a> is an RCS-iteration and for every 7 ~ fl < a, 7 not a 
limit ordinal, Pp+l/Pw has the property then RLim Q has the property. 
(3) We can replace RCS-iteration by any other kind of iteration 
in this definition. 
Remark: In VI 1.6, 1.7, many properties were shown to be preserved by 
CS iteration. In fact the proof shows they are strongly preserved. 
2.5 Clairm (1) In Definition 2.4(1), (2) it suffices to consider a = 2 or a a 
regular cardinal and 7 < fl < a implies PIJP.r has the property (where for 
2,4(2) 7 is zero or a successor ordinal). 
(2) If a property is strongly preserved by RCS-iteration then the 
property is preserved by RCS-iteration. 

317 
Proof: Easy, by induction on a; for (1) use 1.5(3). 
2.6 The Semi-Properness Iteration Lemma: 
(1) Semi-properness is strongly preserved by RCS iteration. 
(2) Suppose Q = <P~,Q :~ < a> is an RCS iteration, for any j ~ a 
for arbitrarily large non limit i < j, Pj/Pi is S 
-semi-proper (S. 
is a Pj- 
name). 
Let 
S = {A:A 
an 
uncountable 
regular 
cardinal 
, 
and 
p {~-p~ " A ~ S j "for somep E Pj and i < j < a, as above ]. 
Then P, = RLim Q is S-semi-proper provided force that: 
(C1) for every limit ~ -~ a there is $ < ~, such that 
~-p~"cf6=~00rforevery$~i

~~ j 
~r j 
(3) In (2) we can weaken (CI) by replacing ~ by a (Q t ~)- named 
ordinal, and replace S by S= IA: for every i < j < a, the cofinality of k as 
computed in V P~ is > r and it belongs to V[Gp,] and belongs to S,j[Gp ]. 
Remark: 1)For i < a non-limit clearly S 
-~,~+1 
-semi-proper. 
is defined, so Q is S 
2) In 2.6(2) and (3), in (C1) we can replace "..., for every ..... 
by for "quite many". 
Proof: (2) We prove the theorem by induction on a, for all Q's and even 
for Q's in forcing extensions of V. 
Let T = {(i,j):S.. is defined ].

Note 
that 
for 
any 
~ < 7 <- a

non-limit, 
r [~,7) = <Pr

Case i%= a non-limit. 
The cases a = 0, a = 1 are too trivial to consider. For a > 1 by the induc-

As Go,G I were arbitrary except that qo e G o, q, e G, clearly qo,q,) is S-

Case B: a 
a limit ordinal and there

pt Ibp," ef a = ~o " 

319 
As N'c<H(A),e>, 
QcN 
, p EN, we can assume pteN 
hence w.l.o.g. 
p tfi =pt 
Moreover by Case A it suffices to prove that Pa/Pp 
is S-semi- 
proper. 
By the induction hypothesis, w.l.o.g, cf a = ~0, and as Q c N, a c N, 
so there are a n < tx,a n < {In+l, (x = 
U 
an, and w,l.o.g, each a n is a successor 
ordinal, and an c N. 
Now let i(fin,~n) :n < co| be a list of the pairs (fi,~), where ~ e N, ~ a cardi- 
nal in S and p 
a 
P=-name of an ordinal < ~:, ~ e N. We define by induction 
on n < co conditionsPn,qn 
such that: 
(1)p n e N CI P.

This is easy and U qn is as required. 
Case C: a a limit ordinal and for no fl < a, p t e Pp,, p r lg <pt

Let a n oN, an <an+l, 
Uan 
=Sup(N 
Aa) 
(as QeN 
a eN), an suc- 
h do 
cessor; and repeal the previous proof. Notice only that we can force any Q- 
names [O,a) 
ordinal to be < U an by 1.7 (like (4) above ) and this insures 
Pn < U ql for every n, and also that we are using condition (C1) from the 
lemma. 
(3) A similar proof. 
(1) Follows. 

320 
In fact we have proved also the following 
2.7 Ler-ma: If Q = <Pi,Qt:i < a> 
is an RCS-iteration as in 2.6(2) or 
2.6(3), ~ a limit ordinal, and ~ I~-p~ " cf ~ > S 0 ", for every i < a, a limit then 
I~-P, "~ > S0 '" Moreover U Pt is a dense subset of P$. 
Also note that the most useful case of 2.6 is 
2.8 Coronary: Suppose < Pi,Q~:i < a> is an RCS iteration, and for every 
j <a 
for arbitrarily large non-limit i <j + 1, Pj+I/P~ is [Sl]-semi-proper, 
and for every successor i < a, I]-p,., " the power of Pi isSl "for some n < ~ . 
Then Pa 
is [St]-semi-proper. 
If in addition [P~] < ]a], for i <a 
and 
a 
is 
inaccessible then Pa is semi-proper. 
2.9 Remark: 
For iteration 
of proper 
forcings, 
there 
is really no 
difference between CS and RCS iterations. 
w Pseudo-completeness 
A widely used notion on forcing is Sl-completeness, i.e., if Pn <-P=+l e P, 
then there is p e P, p,~ < p for every ~z. This is the simplest family of forcing 
which does not add reals, nor new ~-sequences 
of ordinals. 
In our perspec- 
tive we want a condition parallel to this, including, e.g., Prikry forcing. 
3.1 Definition: For a forcing P, a P-name Sol a set of cardinals of V, an 
ordinal 
a 
(always a 
limit ordinal) 
and 
condition p 
we define 
a 
game 
Gg~,P,,5)): in the ith move, player I chooses a A~ and a P-name 
i~ of an 
ordinal < A~, and player lI has to find a condition p~, and a set A~ c A{, 
~~l < ~'~, (A~ 9 V) such that: 
(A) pc ]~- "~ e Ar or Ar ~ ~ 
S "; and 

321 
(B) p~p,p,~pjfor 
j <i. 
The play continues for a moves. 
In a specific play, player II wins iff [p ] LA [pi:i < a] has an upper bound 
(and loses otherwise). 
A player wins the game if he has a winning strategy. 
Notation: Writing RCar, for S, we mean in this content: RCar - [k:X > 1~ 0 
and in V P, cf k = R0]. Similarly for SCar, RUCar. 
3.2 Claim: (i) At most one player can win the game G~. 
(2) If for every ~ c S and/z E SCar,/z ~ ~ ==~/z E S, then in the 
definition of the game, it does not matter if we demand ~I -- I (i.e., if one 
side has a winning strategy iff he has a winning strategy in the revised game). 
(3) If for every cardinal /z, /~i ~ I z---/z0 ~/~ 
c S then in the 
definition of the game, it does not matter if we demand, when ~ =/z 0, that 
~I <~i. 
(4) Also we can replace ~ 
by any set BE V, I BI =~. 
If k~ is 
regular (even if only in V) we can demand A~ r ~ (i.e., is an initial segment). 
(5) If for every regular/z ~ X,/z E S and there is n E S, 1 < ~z < ~0 
N 
and for every p, player II does not lose in the game Gff (p ,P) , then forcing by 
m 
P does not introduce new a-sequences 
from k. (Usually n =2; for n > 2 we 
have to work somewhat more in the proof.) If 
cf a 
(in 1/) is > r we can 
omit the n. 
(6) If n c S, n < ~, adding [m:n < m < l~0] to S does not change 
anything; also if cf ~, c S adding/~ does not change anything. 
Proof: Easy. 

322 
3.3 Definition: The forcing P is (S,a)-complete if player II wins in the 
game G~ (p ,P) for every p. 
We define (S, < fl)-complete similarly. 
P is pseudo ~-complete if it is (Car,l~)-complete for every (cardinal) 
/~ < R;. 
3.4 Lemma: (1) If P is ]a]+-complete then it is (Car,a)-complete. 
(2) If P is (X+(h SCar,a)-complete , a'c ~, then forcing by P 
does not change the cofinality of any/~, 14 0 </~ ,c )k, and forcing by P does not 
add new a- sequences from X (remember X = ~t/:/~ < ~|). 
(3) In particular if P 
is (|2|,~)-complete (or even ({n],~)- 
complete) then forcing by P does not add reals, 
(4) If P is (Sda)-complete then P is S-semi-proper. 
In fact 
(RUCar,co)-completeness suffices for semi-properness provided that ]~-p " #~ 
is a cardinal. 
(5) If p is (Sl,al)-complete, then it is ($2,a2)- complete provided 
that (Y7 c Se)(3lt c $1) [cf 7 = fl or 7 = fl] and a e ~ a 1 
(6) P is (S,a)-complete implies (B - {0|,~) is (S,a)-complete, (B 
the complete Boolean algebra corresponding to P). 
Proof: Easy.

323 
Remark: We can also imitate 2.6, and vice versa. 
Proof: 1) We use Claim 2.5(1), so have to deal only with iteration 
= < Pc,O.:i < a> where a = 2 or a = A a regular cardinal. 
Let S be any one of those three classes of cardinals, (remember, the 
meaning of our S depends on which forcing it applies to, which we know by 
the game we are using). 
Case A: a : 2. 
Let p = (p0,pl) e Q0 * Q , and let Fo,F be the winning strategies of player II 
N1 
-L 
in G~(po,Qo), G~(pl,Q1 ) respectively. By 3.2(4), we can assume F t gives us an 
ordinal or a member of ~0,1| if the corresponding h is regular or ~ respec- 
tively. 
Let in the Cth move player ] choose A~ and a P2-name -tic of an ordinal 
< A~, and player II choose ( P0,1~l,C ) e P2, a Pl-name A~I,c, and a set A0,1 c A~

preserves the following property:

It is easy to see that player II can do this and that it is a winning strategy.

details as an exercise to the reader.

(2) For example, BI'RS iteration preserves, e.g., "real (S,Sl)- 
completeness" for S as above (~-RS means in 2.2 we replace "countable" by 
"of power of --< ~"). 
Proof: Similar to previous ones. 
w Specific forcings 
We prove here on various forcings that they are semi-proper and even 
(S,a)-complete; of course, otherwise our previous framework will be empty. 
Prikry forcing (adding an unbounded ~-sequence to a measurable cardi- 
nal without adding bounded subsets) satisfies all we can expect. But for our 
purposes, more important are forcings which change the cofinality of ~z to n 0, 
without adding reals (or at least not collapsing ~l). Namba [Nm] has found 
such a forcing, when CH holds. 

327 
However we do not know the answer to: 
Problem: Is Namba forcing |81J-semi proper? (see XII w 
However, Namba forcing is not necessarily 
equivalent to "

semi proper moreover (180,81,2~,r 
The point is that when a large 
cardinal is collapsed to 82, if D was originally a normal ultrafilter, then after 
the collapse it may well have some largeness property like the one of Galvin.

Proof: For any sequence ~ = ~ an :n < co t , a n < h, we define a game G~: 

329 
Let 70 be the trunk of T. 
In 
the

zeroth 
) 
move 
player 
I 
chooses 
and player II chooses 7: c Suc ~0(T) - An 
In the nth move, player I chooses A~+ 1 C Suc n.(T), An+: = Cmod till., and 
player II chooses 7/~+1 e Suc ..(T) -An+,. 
In the end, player II wins the play if H(7n) 
= an. 
Now we prove 
(*) 
For some ~ = ( a n :n < ~), a n < A, player II wins the game 
( i.e., has a winning strategy). 
Clearly the game is closed, hence it suffices to prove that for some ~, 
player I does not have a winning strategy. So assume that for every ~ player I 
has a winning strategy F~, and we shall get a contradiction. A winning stra- 
tegy is a 
function 
which, 
given the 
previous moves of the 
opponent 
(71 ..... 
7n in our case), give a move to the player, so that in any play in 
which he uses the strategy he wins the play. 
Now define by induction on n, ~/n e T such that g(7~) = n, 7~+I t n = 7~: 
7o is the trunk of T 
! 
Why does 7.+t exist? For every e, Fa((71 .....

k+-eomplete 
and 
the

So

Proof: 1) Now suppose T is a name of an ~-sequence from ~, and let 
(T,~I ~ ~ P. We define by induction (T~ ,lip ") such that: 
(a) (T0,~I') = ( T,]I[I *), 
(b) (Tn,]l[l') -~n (Tn+t,~l~') and (Tn,]l[I ~ ~~ (T,~+~,~I~

4.8 Problem: Is the forcing semi-proper? 
4.9 Definition: For a filter D on a set I, and a set S 
of cardinals, we 

332 
call D an (S,a)-Galvin filter (and' the dual ideal a Galvin ideal) if player II has 
a winning strategy in the following game, for every J ~ I, J ~ ~bmod D: ( we 
call the game the (S,a)-Galvin game for (D,J). 
In the ith move player I defines a function Fr from I to some k c S and 
player II chooses A~ ~ J N NAj such that IF~(A~)I < X. Player II wins if 
N Ar ~ ~bmod D. For simplicity we can say J was chosen by player I in his 
first move. 
Galvin suggests this game for D cb = the co-bounded subset of k for a car- 
QB 
dinal k, a=c0 and S=|2]. 
So for a=r 
S=|2] 
we omit (S,a) . Note that 
only S • (III + 1) has any importance. 
Galvin, Jech and Magidor [GJM] and Laver, independently proved the fol- 
lowing ( really in [GJM] a somewhat weaker version is proved the difference is 
not essential for us : instead W closed under intersection of countable des- 
cending chain, they prove that player II has a winning strategy ). 
4.10 Theorem= If we start with a universe IF, V ~ "G.C.H. + ~; is measur- 
able " and use Levi collapsing of ~ to Sa (so every )~, Sl ~ k < ~ now will have 
cardinality Sl) then in the new universe V[G], D cb is a Galvin filter, in fact 
(Car - ~#2~,~ + 1)- Galvin filter. Moreover if D c V was a normal ultrafilter on 
~, then in V[G] there is a family W of subsets of ~, A e W --> A # #mod D, W 
is dense [ ( i.e., YA C ~) A ~ ~bmod D ==~ (3t? e W) (B C A)] and W is closed 
under intersection of countable descending chains. [We identify here D with 
the filter it generates in V[G] which is normal.] We call this the ~l-Laver pro- 
perry (omitting ~t usually). 
The relevance of this is: 
4.11 Theorem= Let S ~ SCar. 
(1) Let D be an (S,a)-Galvin filter on I, which is ~+ saturated, A- 

333 
complete and P = PP(D) = [A C I:A ~ r 
D], order by inverse inclusion. 
Then P is (S,a)-complete. 
(2) We can replace the hypothesis in (1) by "D is lal +- Laver "' 
and get even " real (S,a)-complete " 
e 
(3) If P is Nm(Tt,~ ~ (see 4.4(4)), each ]~,7 is an (S,a)=Galvin , 
S2-complete filter then P is (S,o)-complete; and if S D ISz), then P is S-semi- 
proper (as we can add all A, cf A > S 2 to S). 
Remark: 
Really 
in 
(3) we 
can 
replace 
S2-completeness 
by I~ z- 
completeness by using If[ 3.5 instead of 4.6. In fact even this can be waved: in

~ is

XII 3.5). Now T 4 = ~ 6 f' : (u163

[fl,lr~ is not defined ]] is a well founded 
tree, and we can prove by induction on its depth that we can find Ps as 
required. 
(Note we are not assuming CH). 
Proof: i), 2) obvious. 
(3) Also easy, but we shall do it. By 3.4(4) it suffices to prove

Forsimplicitylet2gS. 
Easily we can find (T1,]Q <~ 
~ , p such that for every ~/e T 1, if there 
are fl < A, and q, (Tz,]~ ~ 
~" q, q I[- " a = fl" , then (rl,~[I ~ 
I[- " a = fl '" 
and let fl = fl,r By the ~2-completeness and 4.6 there is T 2, (TI,~*) <--~ (T2,~I~') 
and fl~ is defined iff g (~/) e S for some S ~ ~, and every 7/e T 2. So for some n 
ft. is defined for every ~ e T 2, s 
= n. By the "(S,w)-Galvin " we easily (by 
induction on n, see below for a similar argument) define Pa ,(Tm~')<*Pa, 

334 
and fl < ~ such thatpa II- "a < p", so the Fact holds. 
Letp = (To,till'); w.l.o.g, the trunk of T O is < >. 
In the first move player I chooses ~'0 c S and a P-name ~0 of an ordinal 
<k. 
Player II chooses Po c P, p ":*Po, Po II-p "~0 < fl'' (possible by the Fact 
alone). 
However if player II continues to play like this, he will lose as maybe FI Tn 
( where p~ = (T n,]l[l')) will be |<>~. 
So he is thinking how to make Suc nr.(<>) ~ ~bmod]~l~>. If he, on the 
other hand, will demand Po ~1Pn+l, he will have Suc nr.(<>) ~ ~mod 1[1", but 
it will be hard (and in fact impossible) to do what is required when, e.g., 
kr = I~ 1. So what he will do is to decrease Suc r.(<>), but do it using his win- 
ning strategy H<> for the (S,~)-Galvin game for Jill<>. So in the second move 
player I chooses a cardinal ~'1 E S and P-name p of an ordinal < ~'1. Player 
II, first 
for each 
(po)[n] y/Cpo, 
g(T/)=I 
, chooses p~ 
(po)[n]~;'p~, 
P~ [~-P "~1 "< ~'" 
This defines a function from Suc ~r0(<> ) to R1, so player II 
consults the winning strategy H<>, gels A<~ C~. t, 
[A<~

In 
the 
third 
move, 
player 
II 
tries 
also 
to 
insure 
that 
also 
~T/ ~ N Tn :g (~/) = 2| will be as required. Now player I chooses ~'2 E S and P-

Player 
II chooses 
for 
every 7/E T 1, g(~/) =2 
a 
condition 
P;~ , {Pl)[~] r 
I~P "Pe ~;fl~ '' So for every ~/E T 1, g(~'/) = 1, we have 
a function from Suc @(T1) to ~'2, so consulting the strategy H n, player II 
chooses Ag C •, I A~ ] < R. We can assume that each A~ is proper initial seg- 
ment (i.e., an ordinal) and for ~ = 2, a singleton. So the number of possible 

335 
A~ is h. So now the function ~?-* A~ (~7 E Suc r~(<>)) is a function whose 
domain is in 1~7 E T1:s 
= 1] S ~ SCar. So player II can consult again the 
strategy H<> , and find A<2>, and let T e = [j~T~:s 
= 2, ~? ~ T1, ~ ~A~tl, 
A~r 1 c A~O : A<2>]. 
The rest should be cle'ar. 
w Chain conditions and Avraham's problem 
Chain conditions are very essential for iterated forcing. In Solovay and 
Tenenbaum [ST] this is the point, but even when other conditions are 
involved, we have to finish the iteration and exhaust all possibilities, so some 
chain condition is necessary to "catch our tail." In our main line we want to 
collapse some large ~ to #2 , in an iterated forcing of length {and power) ~, 
each Pi of power < ~ . So we want that ~ is not collapsed, and the obvious 
way to do this is by the ~-chain condition. We prove it by the traditional 
method of the A-system. For general RCS iteration, we have to assume ~ is 
Mahlo (i.e., lk < x strongly inaccessible ] is stationary) and for iteration of 
serai-proper forcing we ask for less. 
Now we are able to answer the following problem of U. Avraham: 
Probler~ Suppose G:C:H. holds inV. Is there a set A CSl so that every 
~-sequence from S2, belong to L[A ]? 
For this we shall collapse some inaccessible ~ which is the limit of 
measurable cardinals changing the cofinalities of arbitrarily large measur- 
ables <~to~0. 
5.1 Definition: (1) For any iteration Q = <Fi,Q. : < a> and a set S : 
we call ~=<Io~:iES) 
a A-system if, for i <3" in S , p~ri =pjrj 
and 
p~ E Pj. We call p~ r i the heart of the A-system, hr ~). 

336 
(2) For a forcing P, we call/~ = <pC:/ c S> a ~-weak A-system if 
p~ E P, ui is a regular cardinal ~, and there is a condition q = hr(/~) ( the 
gE6" 
heart of p) such that for every r, q <r CP there is a<g 
satisfying : if 
a < a~ c S for i < ~1 </~ then lr~ U ~P,~ :i < ~1] has an upper bound in P. 
5.2 Claim: Any A-system in an RCS iteration as in Definition 5.1 (1) , is 
an #l-weak A-system. 
Proof: Easy. 
5.3 The Chain Condition Lemma : (1) Suppose Q = <P~,Q.:i < x> is an 
RCS iteration, ~ regular, [Pi I < x for i < ~ and let A = [A < ~:A strongly ina- 
cessible I. Then for every sequence p = (p~:i c B c A>,we can find a closed 
unbounded C C~ and a pressing down function h on C (~ B (i.e., h(j) <]) 
such that for any a. <pj:j c B (h C,t~(j) = a> is a A-system. 
(2) If every Q. is semi-proper or even they are as in 2.6(3), we 
N?, 
can replace A by A t = [i:0 [~-p~ "cf i > ~0"], 
(3) If Q is as in 2.6(3), ~ strongly inaccessible then we can 
replace A by At=li:cfi=~l~ 
or even A" =li: I~-D"cf/ >R0" for every 
J<~l. 
Before we prove the lemma note 
5.4 Corollary=. (1) If in 5.3, A is stationary, then P~ = RLim Q satisfies 
the x-chain condition. 
(2) If D is a normal ultrafilter on ~, B c D, B c A then (in 5.3) for 
some B t c D, (~pj:j C Bt> is a A-system. 
Proof of 5.3: (1) If B is not stationary ( as a subset of ~), the conclusion 
is trivial, so suppose B is stationary. Necessarily ~ is strongly inaccessible (as 
every member of A is strongly inaccessible and B CA), hence by 1.6, 

337 
P~---~=tRLim~= [JPc. As 
[Pcl <~ for every j <~, there is a one to one 
function H from P~ onto ~. Again as ] P~ < ~ for i < ~, clearly 
C = li:H maps oPi onto i and forj < i,j ~ B implies pi ~ Pil- 
~<~ 
is a closed unbounded subset of ~. We now define the function h wi~h domain 
~: ~(~) = H@~ r ~). 
We first prove that 
h 
is pressing 
down. 
Clearly pc ~i E P~, and if 
cB (~ C then i is strongly inaccessible and (Yj < z)lPj] <i hence by 1.6, 
PC= [JPj, hence pr 
UPj. 
So if icBNC, 
pr 
=pcVi, and by C's 
j<~ 
j<c 
definition p~ ~ Pj, so we finish. 
(2)(3) The proof is similar, using 2.7. 
5.0 Theorem" Suppose CON (ZFC + " there is an inaccessible cardinal 
which is the limit of measurable cardinals "). 
Then the following theory is consistent: ZFC + G.C.H. + (u 
c Sl)(a~) (~ 
an e~-sequence of ordinals < t42, ~ ~ L[A]). 
Proof: We start with a model V of ZFC + "~ is strongly inaccessible, and 
limit of measurables ". We define an iterated forcing ~ P~,Q:i < ~, 
such that 
IP c ] < ~. We do it by induction in i, and clearly (see 1.4(5) for i limit) the 
induction hypothesis 
IP~I <~ 
continue to hold. 
If Qi=~Pj,Qj:j <i t

It is known (see e.g. [J]) that s~ i is measurable in V P~, and any normal

Now by 4.2, Q~,o =PF(D~) is (Car- I~l,co)-complete, Q~,I is (Card,co)- 
complete trivially (by 3.4(1)) hence by 3.5 Q~ is (Card - l~],co)-complete. 
Hence by 3.5, 2.7, P. = RLim < Pi,s 
E ~> does not change the cofinality 
of ~1 and is (|2,~0,~l|,co)-complete, hence it does not add reals. By 3.4(1) each 
Q~ is semi-proper , so by 3.5 P~ is semi-proper. By 5.3(2) P~ satisfies the *=- 
chain condition, so clearly if G. c P. is generic ~fig~] =~v, 
~2v[a.] = ~, 
V,V[G~] have the same reals, and V[G~] satisfies the G.C.H. 
Now if A ~ col , then as Pc satisfies the z-chain condition, A is determined 
by Gr ~IG. N PC for some i < ~. By 1.2, Gi is generic for PC, so L[A] c V[G~], 
but in V[Gr 
an c0-sequence from ~2 ~Ic*] is missing: the Prikry sequence we 
shoot through *=r 
which was measurable in V[Gr

Reflection properties of S02 : refining Avraham's problem and precipitous 
ideals 
In the previous section we have collapsed a large cardinal g to ~2, such 
that to "many" measurable cardinals < *= we add an unbounded co-sequence. 
However, "many" was interpreted as "unbounded set". This is very weak, and, 
it seemed, will not usually suffice. 
Notice that it is known that if we collapse a large cardinal by 815complete 
forcing then S~ ~s[6 < 82:c f ~ = 81] has reflection and bigness properties, e.g., 
those from Theorem 4.10. However, for So 2, we get nothing as it is equal to 
~ < 82 : in the universe before the collapse, cf 6 = ~0] and it is known, e.g., 
that on such a set there was no normal ultrafilter. 
So we can ask whether S~ can have some "large cardinal properties". 
The natural property to consider is precipitous filters D on ~ 
such that 
S02 E D. Such filters were introduced in Jech and Prikry [Pr]. 

339 
Their important property is that if we force by PP(D) (see 4.11), G is gen- 
eric, the domain of D is I, and in V[G], E ~ D is the ultrafilter G generates 
(on old sets) then 1/I/E (taking only old f :I -, V) is well-founded. Jech, Magi- 
dor, Mitchell and Prikry [JMMP] proved that the existence of a precipitous 
filter on ~ 1 is equiconsistent with the existence of a measurable cardinal, and 
also proved the consistency of "D~, (= the filter of closed unbounded sets) is 
precipitous "'. (Notice that the Laver property is stronger). Magidor asked 
whether ZFC + G.C.H.+ there is a normal precipitous filter D on R 2, S 2 e D"is 
consistent. 
We answer positively, by collapsing suitably some ~ to ~2, letting D be a 
normal ultrafilter on ~ in V, (i.e., the filter it generates in the new universe) 
provided that A = ~A < r: in the old universe A is measurable ] c/). 
This was proved previously and independently, using much larger cardi- 
nals, by Gitik. 
We can also consider the following strengthening of Avraham's problem: 
Problem" If V satisfies G.C.H., does there exist A c ~2 such that, for 
every 6 < ~., every ~-sequence from 6 belongs to L(A N 6)? 
Again we have to change the cofinality on a stationary set, and to iterate 
forcing such that stationarily often we change the cofinality of ~2 to S0- 
The first time, the collapse of some A to ~2 is Levi's collapse so by 4.11, 
4.10 we have a (Card v, -- 1~2~,e~)-complete forcing Qx doing this; but later the 
collapse is not even ~l-complete. However, looking again at Theorem 3.5 on 
iterated (S,~)-complete forcing (for various S), we see that less is needed. If 
- ~Pr 
:i < ~) collapses ~ to ~2, it suffices that (RLim Q/PC+l) * Qx is 
({2,~0,~3],~)-complete. So this is what we shall do. But for clarity of exposi- 
tion, we first prove a weaker lemma. 

340 
6.1 Lemma: Suppose D is a normal ultrafilter on A, Q = <Pi,Q$:i < A> 
an RCS iteration, IP~l < h. Suppose further PA = RLim Q is (12,bl0,Ml],6))- com- 
plete and collapse h to M e. Consider the following game G(P0,A0), forP0 9 PA, 
A~0 a PA -name of a subset of A, P0 I~-PA" A 0 ~ ~bmod D ". 
In the first move: 
Player I chooses Px-names p (of an ordinal < ~l) and F (a function from 
"1 
~1 
~ to ~). 
Player II has to choose 191 9 PA, P0 < 191 and 71 < col and l~ 1 < 5) 1 such that 
Pl II-p~"A 1 = A N F[l(lTl|) r Cmod D, and ~ = fll " 
In the n-th move, player l chooses Px-names f 
,F , and player II chooses 
Pn, 
Pn-1 r 
and 
7n < 0ol 
and 
l~n < ~1 
such 
that 
P~ I~p~"A 
=A 
AF-l({Tn])r176 
andfl 
=fin" 
In the end, player II wins if UPn 9 
UPn I I-p~," AA 
~#modD'; 
(remember that U Pn is meaningful by the definition of an RCS iteration). 
Our conclusion is that player II wins the game. 
Proof: So letpo e Px, A o a Px-name, ioo I[-pA"A ~ ~ ~bmod D "and we shall 
describe the winning strategy of player II in the game (G(Po,Ao). Let the win- 
ning strategy of player II in 
G|a,t%,t%I(P 
,Px) be Hip ]. By 3.2(2) , we can 
assume that player II really determined the value of the PA-names of count- 
able ordinals given to him. We can also assume player II is given by player I a 
pair of names of countable ordinals (instead of one). 
Let B o = [s <~,: there is p ~Po, P I[-p,"s eAo"]. 
Now Bo 9 
because 
otherwise, as D is an ultrafilter in V, B o = #rood D, since Po I[-P,"A o c B o" (by 

B's definition) we have P0 ]I-P~,"Ao 
341 
= ~mod D " contradiction. 
Now 
for 
every 
~ ~ B, 
there 
is 
P0,a ~ P~, 
P0~P0,r 
such 
that 
p0.~ ll--e."i e Bo': 
So let player I first move in G(P0,A0) be choosing Ca a ek-name of an ordi- 
nal 
<a 1, and F:A~I, 
F 
a Pk-name. Now for each iEB 0, player II simu- 
lates a play of the game G~ = G~,t 
(Po.~,Px). He plays (gl,F(i)) (i.e., a pair 
of names of ordinals < a~) for player /~, and by the strategy H[P0,i] gets a 
move for player I/~: pl,~ ~Pk, P0,i <Pl,~, and u~.~ <at, e~.~ <~ 
such that 
p~,~ [~p,"flt=a~.~ 
and F(i.)=e~,~" 
Now for some B~cB o, Bxe-D, 
and 
(p 1,r 
e Ba> is a A-system with heart p ~ (see 5.1 ), and we can also make 
<a~.~,et.~ e B~> constantly (a~,et) (for i e Bt). 
Now player II can make his move in G0a0,A0) - he chooses p 1,al and ca- It 
is easy to check that this is a legitimate move. 
So player II continues to play such that after the n-th move: 
(*)n 
there 
are 
B~ C Bn_ aC "'" C B acB 0 all in 
D, pf,~ ~Px, 
for 
O<g <-n, i c B~., Po.~ <--Pl,~ <- "" "~--Pn.~, (PtL~ :i c B~.~ is a A-system with 
heart pg (for s 
<g ~n) po<pl~ 
.. "~Pn, and at the s 
move player I 
chooses fl~,F, and player II chooses pg,a~,e~ and (for g = 1,n and i c B~) 
p~.~ [p'a~ = ~ and F (i) = eg': Also for each s ~n i c/?~, the following is an 
intial segment of a play of a game G~0~o! (p0,~,Px), in which player H uses 
the winning strategy H[P0,i]: 
It is easy to check that player I1 can use this strategy; moreover, by the 
choice of H[P0,~], for every such play, p~ = OP~,~ E Px, for every i ~ t~Bn; as 

342 
B n e D, 
(~ B n e D and clearly <p~:i e f3Br,> 
is a A-system with heart 
1~, ,r162 
71, 
P = IJ 10~, and so by 5.2 p ]~p" for every i C NB, t, F~(i) = er 
So clearly 
player II has won the play, hence the game. 
Remark:. We could have used any S,S c I2,t~0,~1~ instead of [2,~0,~a] and 
get a parallel result. The same holds for 6.2. 
6.2 LemrnR: Suppose ~k is measurable, D a normal ultrafilter over ~,',

an 
RCS iteration 
as 
in 
Theorem 3.5 
hence 
P~, is 
N?, 
(|2,~0,~l],~)-complete and ]P~ I < ~, for i < ~. 
Then P), * Nm(D) is ([2,)~0,~:),o)-complete. 
Proof: Just combine the proofs of 6.1 and 4.11(3) (so now we will have a 
tree of conditions instead p~,~,i E B~)). 
6.B Definition: A filter D on a set I (in a universe V) is called precipitous 
if the following holds: 
[~PP(o)" there are no f n:I -* ordinals , f n c V, 
such that fn+l <Efn for each n " 
where 
(i) PP(D) = |A ~ I:A # ~bmod D] ordered by reverse inclusion. 
(ii) Eis the filter generated by the generic set of PP(D), 
(iii) f <Eg means [a C I:f(a) <g(a)l c E. 
Remark: The following is an equivalent definition A: a filter D over I is 
precipitous if player I does not have a winning strategy in the following game 
P~C~(D). 
I~rst move 
player I chooses A 1 ~ I,A 1 ~ ~bmod D, 
player II chooses H: ~ A:,B 1 ~ ~mod D; 

343 
nth move 
player I chooses A n C: B~_I,An ~ Cmod D, 
player II chooses Bn C An,B~ r Cmod D. 
Player II wins if 
(3 An (which is = (3 Bn) is non-empty (not necessarily 
~bmod D). 
See Jech and Prikry [JP], and Jech, Magidor, Mitchell and Prikry [JMMP]. 
6.4 Theorem= Suppose "ZFC + G.C.H. + t~ is strongly inaccessible and, 
A = |k < g:k measurable ~ is stationary" is consistent. Then: 
(1) The following statement is consistent with ZFC + G.C.H.: 
for every B C ~a for some ~ (in fact ~ c A) , cf ~ =1%, but in LIB (3 ~,], ~ is a 
regular cardinal > t~ 1- 
(2) If in the hypothesis A 9 D, D is a normal ultrafilter on g, then 
there is a normal precipitous ideal on ~2 to which S~ belongs. 
Proof: So let V be a model of ZFC +G.C.H., and let g be a strongly inac- 
cessible cardinal, such that A = IX < g:k measurable I is stationary. 
We now define by induction in i < ~ forcing notions Pi 9 V,Q. ~ V P', such 
that IP~I < tz, <Pj,Qj:j <i> is an RCS iteration. 
So by 1.5(1)it suffices to 
define ~,O for a given < Pj,Qj~ :j < i>. 
Case 1. i = k is a measurable cardinal, such that for everyj < k, 
IPjl <x. 
In this case let D x be a normal ultrafilter over k, and Qx =/Vm (Dx). 
Case 2. Not case I. 
In this case let Q~ be the Levi collapse of (2{61) v to Sl , i.e., If 9 VP':f a 
countable function from 0) 1 to 21Ptl I. 
Now by 3.5 and 6.2 it is easy to see that P.=RLim<aQ:i 
<a:> is 

344 
(I2,t~0,t~l{,eo)-eomplete, and by 5.4 it satisfies the x-chain condition. 
So clearly in V PA 
G.C.H. holds, every real is from V, and t~ 1 = t~ t~ 2 = ~. 
Also if ~, 9 A, then (Yi < ~,) ]Pi I < h (prove by induction on i for each X). Let 
G ~ P~, be generic, and we shall prove that V[G] satisfies the requirements. 
Part 1: So let BCt~ 2, and let E9 V be a P~- name for it. 
Then 
Co=~rS:(Yi <~), E N [i] 
has 
a 
Pi-name 
for some j <~ 
is a 
closed 
unbounded subset of g, because P~ satisfies the g-chain condition and obvi- 
ously C0 c V. 
Now if X 9 C o N A, then we know I P~ I < ~ for i < ~, so case 1 holds hence 
Qx = Nm(DA), hence in V[G],cf ~ = t~ 0. On the other hand, clearly G A P~ is a 
generic subset of P~ as Px <~ P~), by 5.4 P~ , satisfies the R-chain condition, 
so II-p~"cf ~. = ~". Hence in V[G N P~], A N ;k is present, but h is a regular 
cardinal > t41. So also in L[A N ~,],~, is a regular cardinal > t~ 1. 
Part 2. The following is essentially the same proof as [JMMP] who do it 
for the Levi collapse; and it suffices for (2) of the theorem. It follows from 
Magidor [Mg 3] theorem 2.1, and is included for completeness only. 
6.4 Lemma: Suppose g is measurable, D a normal ultrafilter over ~;, 
= (P~,Q:i < g> an RCS iteration, IP~I < g for i < ~;, P = P, = RLim Q. 
Then in V p, D is a precipitous filter.

7.5 Discussion: We can deduce various conclusions, e.g., from 7.3 on the 
preservation of the {8 l~-semi (c0,1)-properness +X property "" where X stands 
for c0~-boundings, Sachs, Laver, PP. Alternatively we can define suitable 
games; the property will be the existence of a winning strategy of the favorite 
player . But the preservation theorem is weaker. 
For example, the Sacks

chooses a P-name ~ 
of a natural number and player tl a set W~ C ~0. In the

Friedman [Fr] asked the following. 
Probler~c Is there for every S c S~ a closed set of order type c01 , 
included in S or S~ - S? We call this statement Fr(~a). 
Van Liere proved that Fr(R2) implies N2 is a Mahlo strongly inaccessible 
cardinal in L; and Fr(~a) + not Fr(~2) 
(t~ a regular >~2) implies 0# exists. 
We prove the consistency of Fr(t~2) + G.C.H. with ZFC, modulo the consistency 
of some measurable cardinal (of order 1 ). 
8.1 Definition: We define by induction on n what are a measurable car- 
dinal of order n and a normal ultrafilter of order n. For n = 0 those are the 
usual notions. 
For n + 1,D is a normal ultrafilter of order n + 1 on ~ if

[A < r:A is measurable of order n ~ e 19 and it is a normal ultrafilter.

Clearly Player II can do the above and it gives him a strategy. We have to 
prove that he wins by it. So let A = c~/L n, and for ~7 e CA increasing, we know 
that [pntfZ:s < c0] has an upper bound (by 6) so let is be p~.

8.3 Theorem= If "ZFC + G.C.H. + there is a measurable of order 1" is 
consistent, then so is "ZFC + G.C.H.+ every stationary subset of ~a , or its 
complemented, contains a closed copy of ~1". 
Remark: We do not try to get the weakest (it is enough that IA < g:A 
measurable of order 0] is weakly compact). It will be interesting to find an 
equi-consistency result.

is well know that there are such Sty. 
We define an RCS iterated forcing <Pi,Q.:i < ~> by induction in i, such 
that ] P~ ] < ~, and for every measurable/z < ~, i < lZ ~

Then we let Q~ be as in 8.2 if p is in the generic set, and 
trivial otherwise. 
We leave the checking, that the forcing works, to the reader. In fact we 
get every stationary S ~ S~ contains a closed copy of ~01. 
8.4 Theorem: Suppose "ZFC + there are two supercompact cardinals" is 
consistent. Then so is ZFC + G.C.H. + "Fr (Sa) for every regular ~a" (a > 1). 
Proof: Let V ~ G.CH. + ~ < k + ~,A are supercompact. 
By a theorem of Laver ILl we can assume no m-complete forcing will des- 
troy the supercompactness of x. The following is known: 
Fact: 
If Ha~k

S C S~

tionary. Even more easily, if in V, ~ < ~# ~ h, ~# regular, S c Sg stationary, it 
remains stationary in V P. We can conclude

XI CHANGING COFINALITIES; EQUI-CONSISTENCY RESULTS 
Abstract: We formulate a condition which is (strongly) preserved by revised 
countable support iteration, implies ~l is not collapsed, no real is added and 
is satisfied e.g. by of Namba forcing, and any ~l-complete forcing. So we can 
iterate forcing collapsing ~2 up to some large cardinal. 
Our aim is to improve the results chapter of X to equi-consistency results. 
w 
The theorems 
1.1 Discussion: In this chapter we list the demands that we would like 
our condition to satisfy, and show how, having a condition satisfying these 
demands we can prove our theorems. Then, in the following sections we will 
formulate the condition and prove it satisfies all our demands. 
The demands: We will have a condition for forcing notions such that: 
(i) If P satisfies the condition then forcing with P does not collapse Bl, 
and moreover does not add reals. 
(ii) If P is an RCS iteration of forcing notions such that each of them 
satisfies the condition then p satisfies it as well. 
(RCS iteration was defined in X w and later we will remind its definition and 
its basic properties). 
Really we do not get (ii) but a slightly different version, which is as good 
for our purpose 
(ii)' Assume V satisfies: if Q = <P~,Q.:i < ~> is an RCS iteration, Q2~+l is 
Levi collapse of 2 Ie41 + I~l to 81 (by countable conditions), each Q 
satisfies 

355 
the condition. Then P6, the revised limit of 9, satisfies the condition. 
(iii) If Q = <P~,Q :i < ~> is an RCS iteration, g is strongly inaccessible 
cardinal and for every i < tc Pi satisfies the condition and I P~ I < ~ for i < 
then P- the revised limit of Q satisfies the ~-e.c. 
(iv) The condition is satisfied by the following forcing notions: 
a. Namba forcing. (The original Namba forcing will be defined 
later like NrnlDeb~ from X 4.4(4), it adds a cofinal countable subset to co 2 
without collapsing c01). We denote this forcing notion by Nrnt. 
b. Any~l-closed forcing notion. 
e. P[S] , where S 
as a stationary 
subset of r 
such that 
a E S ~ 
cf a = r 
and P[S] = [if :f is an increasing and continuous function 
from a+l into S, for some a < oil. 
Note that P[S] shoots a closed copy of ~1 into S hence collapses t~ 2. 
Remark: The condition on P is by the terminology we shall use, 
the [A ~ IPI :A regular > t~l] - condition. 
Assume we have a condition satisfying all of these demands and !et us get to 
the proofs of our theorems. 
1.2 Theorem : If "ZFC + G.C.H. + there is a measurable cardinal" is con- 
sistent then so is "ZFC + G.C.H. + there is a normal precipitous filter D on co 1 
such that So ~ E D " 
Remark: (1) So 2 is ia < r 
a = a;]. 
2) By [JMMP] the converse of this theorem is also true, so we have an 
equiconsistency result. 
(3) In fact if "ZFC + there is a measurable cardinal" is consistent then 
so is "ZFC + G.C.H. + there is a measurable cardinal". 
A;. 
Proof: We start with a model of ZFC + G.C.H. with a measurable cardinal 

356 
We iterate, by the RCS iteration, forcing with Nm? ~c many times. 
(More for- 
mally let Q = <Pt,Q~:i 
< ~> be an RCS iteration, Q 
is NrnI (see (iv)Ca) above), 
Q 
= Col(Ml,EIee*l =lil). 
Let V denote 
our ground 
model, and P 
denote 
~2i+i 
R Lira Q. We can prove by induction IPi I < ~; moreover if ~k_ ~ is strongly 
inaccessible then i < ~, ~ 
I Pt I < X, and P~ has power k. 
By 1.1 (ii)' , P satisfies the condition 
(remembering 
(iv)Ca)) hence 
by 
1.1(i), forcing by P does not collapse 1r 1 nor add reals and so V v ~ CH. On 
the other hand 
clearly [Pi{-> i, hence 
Q 
collapses 
[i[ to I~ z, hence all 
~2i+1 
X , l~ 1 < k < ~ are collapsed by P. By 1.1(iii) P satisfies the z-chain hence 
is not collapse. So clearly l~ e = l~, I~ P = ~, V P satisfies G.C.H. 
Let F be a normal ~-complete ultrafilter over ~ (in V), then by (iii) and X. 
6.4 (see references 
there) , F generates 
a normal precipitous 
filter on ~ in 
V[P] . Let A be I~<g:X 
is inaccessible I (in V) then A cFso 
we are done 
with the proof once we show that X c A implies X has cofinality ~ in V[P]. 
As 
Nm? satisfies our condition (by demand iv), a) and k is inaccessible in V we 
know that the iteration up to stage X satisfies the h-c.c. (by demand iii) after 
forcing with Pa, X =l~ a and at the next step in the iteration 
Nm? shoots a 
co final c0-sequence into X, a sequence that exemplifies cf X = co in V[P]. 
1.3 Theorem: If "ZFC + G.C.H. + there is a Mahlo cardinal" is consistent 
then so is "ZFC + G.C.H. + for every S C S~ there 
is a closed copy of r 
included in it or in S~ - S". 
Remark: Van-Liere had shown the converse. 
For the clarity of the exposition we prove here a weaker theorem 
and 
postpone the proof of the theorem as stated above to the last section of this 
chapter. 
1.4 Theorem: If "ZFC + G.C.H. + there is a weakly compact cardinal" is 

357 
consistent then so is "ZFC + G.C.H. + for every S c So 
2 there is a closed copy 
of ~I included in it or in S0 2 - S". 
Proof: The proof is very much like the proof of theorem 8.3 of X; 
the only difference is that now we do not have to demand that there will be 
measurable 
cardinals below the weakly compact cardinal. 
We give here only 
an outline of the proof. 
Let ~ be weakly compact 
w.l.o.g. V = L , so by 
Jensen's work there is <Aa:a < ,;, a inaccessible >, a diamond sequence satis- 
fying " A a C H(a), and for every finite sequence A of subsets of H(~) , and II~ 
sentence tb such that < Y(~:),e,A> ~ ~b there is some inaccessible k such that 
,4tH(A) =AA 
and <H(A),e,A> ~#. 
Now 
we 
define an RCS 
iteration 
= <P,,Q.:i < ~> . Let Q = P[S ] (as it was defined in I.i (iv)(b)) whenever 
Aa = <Pc, S >, a strongly inaccessible and [~-p "S 
is a stationary 
subset of 
Na 
Na 
S~ ( =Is < A:cf a = c0])", and in all other cases we force with the usual Levi 
Si-closed conditions for collapsing 3 s'. 
In the model we get after the forcing ~ : S 2 and every stationary subset of 
S0 2 includes a closed copy of co 1. (For checking the details note that our forc- 
ing notion, and any initial segment of it, satisfy our condition thus no reals 
are added, ~1 is not collapsed and in any ~,-stage for inaccessible A, the initial 
segment of the forcing satisfies the k-c.c, so at that stage A = ~0 2 and when we 
use P[S;~] we are forcing with P[S] for S which is a stationary subset of S0 a ). 
1.5 Theorem: If "ZFC + G.C.H. + 
there is an inaccessible cardinal" is 
consistent 
then so is "ZFC + G.C.H. + there is no subset of I~ 1 such that all 
sequences of S 2 are constructible 
from it". 
Remark: 1) This theorem 
answers a question of Uri Avraham who has 
also proved its converse. 
2) Again we can omit G.C.H. from the hypothesis. 
Proof: Let R: be inaccessible 
and let Q = <Pi,Q.:i < ~> 
be an RCS 

358 
iteration, 
Q 
=(Nmt) r 
Q 
= Cot(t~a,2lP*l+lil ). 
In the resulting model 
N2~ 
~2i+1 
= co S and as the forcing satisfies the ~-c.c. any subset of Blis a member of a 
model obtained by some proper initial segment of our iteration, but the co- 
sequence added to co2 by the next Nrnt forcing does not belong to this model 
so it is not constructible from this subset of ~l. 
1.6 Theorem: If the existence of a Mahlo cardinal is consistent with ZFC 
then so is "G.C.H. + for every subset A of ~2 there is some ordinal ~ such that 
cf ~ = co but ~ is a regular cardinal in L[A ~ ~5]". 
Remark: Again this is an answer to a question of Uri Avraham and again 
he had shown that the converse of the theorem is true as well. 
Proof: Let~be 
Mahlo (in amodelof 
Vof ZFC + G.C.H.) ,w.l.o.g. V=L 
and iterate as in the proof of 1.5. Let A be a subset of t~ 2 in the resulting 
model. 
We can find a closed and unbounded 
C C~2 such that for ~ E C 
A f~ 6 ~ V[P~] where 
P~ is the ~'s initial segment of our iteration. As ~ is 
Mahlo, I~, < ~:~, is inaccessible I is stationary in it so there is some inaccessi- 
ble A in C. 
Such ~, exemplifies our claim. 
Px satisfies the ~,-c.c., so in 
V[Px] X = co2 hence 
Nm' at the A-step of the iteration adds a cofinal co 
sequence into ~, so in V[Pr], which is our model, cf A = co. 
One more answer to a question from Uri Avraham's dissertation is 
1.7 Theorem: (Ben-David): The consistency of " ZFC + there exists an 
inaccessible cardinal 
" is equivalent with the consistency with ZFC of the 
statement: 
"There is no cardinal preserving extension of the universe in 
which there is a set A c ~2 such that L[A] satisfies C.H. and ~[A] = ~2 ". 
Remark: In fact there is no class of V which is a model of ZFC , having 
the same t~ 1 and ~2 and satisfying C.H. 

359 
This theorem was obtained by Shai Ben-David using the same method as 
of 1.5, 1.6,: 
Hint: For the statement to hold in V, it is enough to have: 
L[~ < l~. cf v~ = l~0~ ] has at least I~reals; more explicitely 
there are ~t 2 distinct reals r, such that for some ~c 
Car L , r(t~)= 0 iff 
cf ((~ +~)L) = l~ ~ (i.e., the cofinality is in V, ~+e is computed in L). 
However 1.1 is not enough as in (iv) no forcing adding reals appear, but 
we can use XII w instead (i.e. for unboundedly many i 
, Q is Cohen forcing) 
w 
The Condition 
In this section we get to the heart of this paper, the definition of our con- 
dition for forcing notions. We need some preliminary definitions. 
2.1 Definition: A tagged tree is a pair < T,I> such that: 
1) T is a tree i.e., a non-empty set of finite sequences of ordinals 
such that if 77 E T then any initial segment of 77 belongs to T. T is ordered by 
initial segments, i.e., 7/<v iff 7/is an initial segment of v. 
2) I is a function from T such that for every • c T:I(~7)(~-Zl~) is a 
family of subsets of some set called the domain of I~, 
A 1 c A 2 and A 2 c I~ 
implies 
A 1 E I~ and 
Suet(q)~J'lv:v 
is an immediate 
successor 
of 7/ in 
T~ c Dom I~. A family like I~ is called monotone 
3) For everyT/c 
T 
S~cr(~7) #r 
and above each 7/c T there is 
some v c T such that Suc:r(v) t~ I v. 
2.1A 
Convention: 
For 
any 
tagged 
tree 
(T,I) 
we 
can 
define 
I t , 
I~ = Ila "77 ^<a> 
cAI :A ~I~; 
we sometimes, in an abuse of notations do 
not distinguish between I and It. e.g. if I~ is constantly I* 
we write I* instead 
I. 

360 
2.2 Definition: 7} will be called a splitting point of (T,I) if 5~ZCr(7/) g I o 
(just like v in 3) above). 
2.3 Definition: We now define orders between tagged trees: 
a) < T2,12> <- < Tl,Ilzangle if T1 ~ T 2 and whenever 7} 9 TI is a splitting 
point 
of 
T 1 then 
SucTt(W ) ~ I2(~/) , I1(~7) t SUCT,(~7) = 12 r 5~ZCrt(eta ) (where 
IrA = [B : B CA and B 9 I]). 
b) < Ta,Ia> -<* < TI,II> iff < Tx,Ii> ~ < Ta,Ia> and every 7} 9 Tt which is a 
splitting point of T 2 is a splitting point of T 1 as well. 
2.3 A Notation: We omit 11 and denote a tagged tree by T 1 whenever 
I, = IA c Suet(v) : 
IAI < ]Sucr(~?)] if ]SueT(v) ] >S O andA # SueT07 ) 
if ISu 
r(n) l 
for every 7/e T. 
2.4. Definition: 1) For a set of regular cardinals S, an S-tree T is a tree 
such that for any splitting point ~7 e T [ SUET(7/) [ e S, or ] SueT(w) [ = 1. 
2) For a set of monotone families I, a tagged tree < T,I> is an I 
-tree if for every~7 6 T , 1,161 (up to an isomorphism) or ]SttCT(W )] = i. 
2.5 Definition: 1) For a tree T, IAm T is the set of all ~-sequences 
of 
ordinals, such that every finite initial segment of them is a member of T. 
2) A subset J of a tree T is a front if ~7,v e J implies none of them 
is an initial segment of the other, and every 7/e Lira T has an initial segment 
which is a member of J. 
2.6 Main Definition: Let S be a set of regular cardinals; we say that a 
forcing notion P satisfies the S-condition if there is a function F, so that 
1) for every S-tree T, iff 
is a function f 
: T -, P satisfying 
a) v <p n implies f (u) < f (V) and 
b) there are fronts Jn(n < r 
( of T) such that every member of Jn+l has 
a 
proper 
initial 
segment 
belonging 
to 
Jn 
and 
~7 < Jn 
implies 

361 
<Suc(7?),<f(w)'Sucr07)>> 
= 
F(~7,w[~7], <f(u):u<~7>. 
(w[77] is 
define 
below ) 
Then for every T t, T<_ * T t there is some p 9 
such that p ][-"3~ 7 ELim T t 
such that Vk < c0 f (~7 t k) 9 G"where G is the P-name of the generic subset 
of P. 
2) F(~?,w[~7], <f(~?~s 
9 s -~(N)>) 
depends really not on 7? but 
only on ~rw 
i.e, if ~(V)=~(v), 
(V~-<w)7?(s 
f(~rs 
then F(~7,w ,< f (UtJg) " ~ <- Jg (77)>) = F(~,w ,< f (uts ) " ~. <- ~. (u) 
2.6A Explanation: First for the notation w[N] = Ik : ~? t k 9 LJ J;~]- Now 
~<~ 
for the meaning: 
One can regard the situation as a kind of a game. 
The 
players in their turn define f : T -, P along the branches of T. The F is a 
kind of a winning strategy, if the "good" player uses it enough times ( on an 
infnite set of fronts) then it assures his winning i.e., the existence of a condi- 
tion p e P as in the end of the definition. 
As one can see from the F, the 
information each player has is quite limited - he knows only what happened 
along the branch N he is dealing with at that stage, what he has to define is 
s~c (7) , f r suet(v). 
Z.6B 
Convention: 
1) 
We 
write 
Fw (~7,<f (~) " u <~ ~7> ) 
for 
F(~7,w,<f(v): 
v.grl> ) and if Iwl = lul --k implies F w =F u we write F~ for 
F w (and Fu). We also write Fn(~7,w,<f(,, ) ' v W,~?>) whenn 
= Iw 1. 
2) In Definition 2.6, the value F gives to S~ZCT(71) is w.l.o.g. 
I~? A <a> 9 a < k] for some 
k , and we do not strictly distinguish between k 
and ~CT(~7). 
2.7 Definition: For a set I of monotone families we define similarly when 
does a forcing notion P satisfies the l-condition. (the only difference is deal- 
ing with l-trees instead of S-trees), so now 
We allow ourselves to omit Sucr(~7) when it is well understood. 

362 
w 
The preservation properties guaranteed by the S-condition: 
3.1 Definition: 1) A monotone family I is k-complete if any union of 
less than k members of I is still a member of I. 
2) Atagged tree <T,I> is A-complete if for each 77c T I n is ~- 
complete. 
3) A family K of monotone families is k-complete if each I c I is 
~,-complete. 
3.2 Theorem= (CH) If P is a forcing notion satisfying the I-condition for 
an l~ 2 -complete l then forcing with P does not add reals. 
As an immediate conclusion we get: 
3.3 Theorem= 
(CH) If P is a forcing notion satisfying the S-condition for 
a set S of regular cardinals greater than 1~ 1 then forcing with P does not add 
reals. 
The main tool for the proof of the theorem is the combinatorial lemrna 
3.5., we need a preliminary definition. More on such theorems and history see 
Rubin and Shelah [ RS]. 
3.4 Definition: We define a topology on Lim T (for any tree T) by 
defining for each 7/ c T 
T[~]=lv'7/<~vorv<:77] 
and letting ILim T,~'77c T] 
generate the family of open subsets of Lim T (so each such set is also closed). 
3.5 Lemma: If < T,I> is a A+-complete tree and H is a function from 
Lim T to ~ such that for every a < A 
H-1(la]) is a 13orel subset of Lira T (in 
the topology that was defined in Definition 3.4.) then there is a tagged sub- 
tree < TI, 6 
, < T,I> ---* < Tt,l> such that H is constant on Lim T t. 
Proof: First note that if T I c T is such that: < > c TI; for every 77 e T I 
if 7 7 is a splitting point of T then Sucz1(r/) = 6~ZCT(77 ) and if 77 is not a splitting

point of T then ISucr,(n)l = :. then ( T, 0 ~~ ( Zl,Ir TI> , so w.l.o.g, we can 
assume that in T every point is either a splitting point or it has only one 
immediate extension. 
For each a < h let us define a game Ga: in the first move player I chooses 
a node 7/o in the tree I~ (~70) = 0, player II follows by choosing a proper subset 
A 0 of SUCr(~70 ) such that A 0 c In, 
, in the ~z-th move player I choses an 
immediate 
extension of ~?n-1 , ~?n such that r/n ~ An_: or *?n-: is not a split- 
ting point of T, and player II follows by choosing A n E In. 
Player 
I wins 
if for 
the 
infinite 
branch 
~7 defined 
by ~70,~71,~72-.. 
P 
H(~?) = a. 
By the assumption 
of the lemma this is a Borel game 
so by 
Martin's Theorem, 
one of the players has a winning strategy. 
We claim that 
there is some a < h for which player I has a winning strategy in the game G a. 
Assume otherwise, i.e., for every a < k player II has a winning strategy F a. We 
construct 
an infinite branch 
inductively, 
let 110 be such 
that 
s 
= 0, 
190 E T. At stage n let A n be U Fa(7?0,~T1 ..... 
7/n_1), as In._ l is k+-complete 
et<), 
and 
each 
Fa(77o ..... 
~7n-1) 
is 
a 
member 
of 
it 
A n c In_: . 
Clearly 
Sucr(n~_:) r An. 
If l?n_ 1 is not a splitting point it has only one immediate successor and let it 
by 
~n, 
otherwise 
remember 
(S~zc (r/n_1) - An) # r 
so 
we 
choose 
~Tn ez (Sucr(~Tn_l) -An). 
Let ~7 be the infinite branch 
that we define by our 
construction 
and let a(*)= 
H(~?). 
Now in the game 
Go(. ) if player I will 
choose at stage n 
~Tn (for all n) and player II will play by Fa(o), player I will 
win through he used his winning strategy Fa(o ), contradiction. 
Let a(*) be such that player I has a winning strategy ha(,. ) for Ga(o ) and 
let T ? be the subtree of T defined by IV " <7/t 0 ..... 
~7 t n-l> 
is the first n 
moves of player I is a play in which he plays according to ha(.)]. 
Proof of Theorem 3.2: Let T be a name of a real in V[P] and p 0 c P and 
N 

364 
we will find a condition p 9 P forcing r to be equal to a real from V. Let us 
define f, 
< T,I> be such that Rang I C K, f 
: T -~ P: we defined by induction 
on k, for a 
sequence 
rl of ordinals of length k, the truth value of ~7 9 T, 
a f(~7), and then ] n . We let < > 9 T , f(<>) 
=P0. 
For 779 T of even length 
2k, 
we 
use 
F 
from 
the 
definition 
of 
the 
l[ 
-condition, 
to 
define 
Sucr(~7),l n , f t Sucr(~7). For ~7 of length 2k+1, we let Sucv(T) = {77 ^ <0>l, 
and we define f (~7 ^ <0>) such that it will be an extension of the value of f 
on its predecessors 
and such that f (rl) forces a value for r(k) (the k's palce 
of the real that r names). 
We continue 
by defining H:Lim T ~ ~" ( as we 
N 
assume C.H. 
j~vj = 1t 1 so it is just like a function from T to ~01) by letting 
H(~7)(k) = the value forced by f (tit 2k+1) for r(k). 
By Lemma 3.5 there is 
< T,I/> <-" < Tt,I/> 
on which H is constant, 
now let p be the forcing condi- 
tion that by Definition 2.8 forces "~7 9 Lim T t such that u 
f (7/t k) 9 G ". 
~p 
This p forces r to equal the constant value of H on T t which is a member of V, 
andp 
IJ-"P0 9 G ". 
~p 
3.6 Theorem: If P is a forcing notion satisfying the S-condition for a set 
of regular cardinals S. 1t 1 ~' S then forcing by P does not collapse 111. 
Remark: Note that here we do not assume C.H. and that maybe 110 9 S. 
The proof is quite similar to the proof of Theorem 3.2 but here we use a some- 
what different combinatorial lemma. 
Note also that we shall not use the 
theorem; and that we can generalize it to l-trees. 
3.7 Lemma: Let < T,l> be such that for every ~ 9 T either I. is A +- 
complete or J SueT07 ) J < A for some regular A, then for every H 9 T -. A there 
isa<Xand</~,l>,<T,H> 
<'</e,l> such that for all 77 9 /~ H(~7) < a. 
Proof of the lemma: W.l.o.g. each r I is either a splitting point or has only 
one immediate successor. We define for each a < A a game G a very much like 
the way we did it for proving Lemma 
3.5, the only difference being that if 

365 
[Sucr(~ln)[ < A player II chooses A n such that [Sucr(~Tn ) -An[ 
= I (otherwise 
player 
II chooses 
A n el n 
just 
like in 3.3); 
player 
I wins if for every 
< a~ H(~/n ) < a. Here again the game Ga is determined 
for every a (here 
simply because if player 1I wins a play he does so at some finite stage). Again 
we claim that there should be at least one a for which player I has a winning 
strategy. Assume the contrary 
and let F a be players II winning strategy for 
each a < A. We construct 
a subtree T ~ deciding by induction on the height of 
the members 
of T which are the members 
of 7 ~. For ~/that is already in T ~ if 
[ Sucr(~l) [ < A we include all its members in T'; otherwise X n is A+-complete so 
~cr(~7) - 
U Fa(7/r 0# 7 t 1 ..... 
~/) is not empty, so we pick one extension of 
a<A 
9 / from this set and the rest of 5~Cr(~/) will not be in T'. T* is a tree of height 
branching 
to less than 
A successors 
at each point, so as A is regular 
]T ~ <A 
and 
there 
is some 
a" <A 
such 
that 
7/ e T* implies H(~7)<a'. 
Regarding the game Ga,, there is a play of it in which player I chooses all 
along the way members 
of T* and player II plays according to Fa,, of course 
player I wins this game contradicting 
the assumption 
that F a, is a winning 
strategy for II. 
We define 7 ~ just like we did in the proof of Lemma 3.5, collecting all the 
initial segments 
of plays of player I in the game G=, 
when he plays accord- 
ing to his winning strategy Ha,. 
Proof of theorem 
3.6: Just like in the proof of 3.1 having a name of a 
function in V[P] mapping ~ into ~1 we take an S-tree 
T, define a function 
h : T -~ P using the F in odd stages and in even stages forcing more and more 
values for T. Just like there we get a condition p e P forcing the function 
N 
that T names to be bounded below ~1, so we are done. 
3.8 Theorem= if P satisfies the I-condition, and A is regular and (VI e I) 
(I L/II < A or I is A+-complete then I~-p "cf A > M 0 ". 

366 
3.8 Claim: The statement 
" in V P , Q satisfies the S-condition "may be 
interpreted 
as "in V[" , Q satisfies the I-condition" in two ways: 
a) I=llA 
e V[':A CA, V [" ~ IAI <M :XeS] 
b)[=IIAcV:AcX, 
VI::IAI<X]:XcS] 
Note that I c ~ is identified with the ideal it generates. 
However the two interpretations 
are equivalent if Q satisfies the ~-chain 
N 
condition for each ~, c S (and even weaker conditions) [ and this will be the 
case in all our applications.

Forcing notions satisfying the S -condition 
4.1 Definition: Namba forcing Nm' is the set I T : T is a tagged IM2~-tree 
] with the order T ~ 7 ~ (see 2.3); so T' is more informative in the forcing, and 
cb 
we identify T and (T, D). 
Remark: In X 4.4 (4) the variant of Namba forcing Nnz is the set of all 
trees of height c0 such that each tree has a node, the trunk, such that below 
its level the tree-order 
is linear and above it each point has ~2 many immedi- 
ate successors, 
the order is inversed inclusion. 
Namba introduces 
Nm' in 
[Nm]. Both forcing notions add a cofinal ~-sequence 
to co 2 without collapsing 
o l, nor (if CH) adding reals, but they are not the same. 
4.2 Claim: (Magidor and Shelah). Assume CH. 
If 
h[h'] 
is 
a 
Namba 
sequence 
[Namba'-sequence] 
(i.e., 
h .o_~wv 
h rn EID for every n < ~ andp 
in the generic subset of /W~[Nm']) then in 
V[h] we cannot find a Namba'-sequenee 
over V, nor can we in V[h'] find a 
Namba-sequence 
over V. 
Proof: First 
we look in V[h], let h be the Nm-name 
of the Namba 
sequence, and let f be a Nrn-name of a function from co to ~2- Let T o E Nm 
N 

367 
and 
suppose 
TO ]~-Nm "Sup Rang f = ~2 t'''. 
Now it is easy Lo find in /Vrn, 
T 1 -> TO, such that for each m -< n < ~ the truth value of "'f(n) = h(m)': 
"'f(n) < h(m)" 
are determined 
by T l (i.e., forced). (possible by X 4.7, as 
forcing by Nm does not add reals.. 
Let 
A = l/c < ~ 9 
for 
some 
m k, 
T 1 
forces 
that 
for 
every 
JZ </c 
f(g)< 
h(m~)<--~(k)~ so A is an infinite subset 
of co, in V, and let 
A =1/cs163 <ol, 
/c0<k,</c2<..., 
and 
T 1 ]~"f(i)<f(ms 
for 
i </c~" 
Now 
(*) T1 ]]-Nm" for every F 9 V a function from ~2 to ~o a, there is s 
< e~ 
such that for every JZ > s 
+ 3 
f(k~) > F(f(k~_2) ) "" 
This is because for every F 9 V (as above) and TO -> T 1 (in Nm) if I~ 0 is the 
length of the trunk of TO, for some T 3 >- T2; 
(**) 7 3 
if e > g0 + 3 then 
> F(f(ks 
) " 
Simply choose T a = ~7 9 T2 : if s 
-> IZ + 1 > t~ 0 then 77(I~ ) > F(V(~-I))J, 
clearly T 3 9 Nm 
, TO _> T 2 and TO satisfies (**). 
So (*) holds, but it exemplifies f is not a Nm'-sequence, 
i.e., T 1 ]~-Nm "f is 
not a Namba'-sequence 
" So we prove one half of 4.2. 
Now let us prove the second assertion in the claim, i.e., let f be a Nm'- 
N 
name of an increasing function from ~ to ~a, and we shall prove that it is 
forced not to be a Nm-sequence; 
clearly this is enough. 
Let TeNm' 
, then we can find T ~ 
Y , TO e Nm' such that for every 
splitting 
point

of 
T O 
and 
v=~/^<a>

some 
r~ v, 
Y[~ ]~-N~' "nv = Min Ig : f(s

T{v ] ,

368 
Now by 3.5 there is T 1, 
T ~ 
T 1 (in Nm' ) and n~(~ <c0) such that 
n~=n~(~) for every~/9 T 1. Let [~i :i <~ 
bealist 
of Is <~:n~ 
#~], such 
that~i <~i+l, so~? ~ T 1, 6(#) = ~i-l implies T/ is a splitting point of T 1. Let 
ire= [7/9 T l: ifl~e~ <lZ(~?),thenn(l~2~) =Min[a:(71tgei ) ~<a> E T 1] 
F(a) = Min [7 : (Yk < ~) 
(Yv E T 1 /~ ~>a)(~p 9 ~7)(v ^ p 9 T 1] 
A =[7/e~ :i <~] 
Then T 29 
, T 2_~ T 1, and Fc Visa function from~a to ~2 , A E V 
an infinite subset of e~ and 
T2 [l--/~" for every k E A , f(/c) < F(f(k-1))" 
N 
this shows that (T 2 force ) f is not a Nm-sequence. 
4.3 Claim= 1) Nm' , Nm do not satisfy the 2~~ 
condition. 
2) It is consistent with ZFC that 2 ~~ ~2 , 2~1 arbitrarily large 
and Nm, Nm' satisfies the ~4-c.c. 
Remark: The proof of 3) is inspired by the proof of Baumgartner of the 
consistency of: ZFC + 2 B~ arbitrarily large + there is no set of 1~ 3 subsets of ~1 
with pairwise countable intersection. Thinking a minute the close connection 
between the problems should be apparent. 
The other ingredient is the A- 
system theorem on trees from Rubin and Shelah [R S]. 
Proof: 1) For every real ~7, let 
T~ = Iv 9 v 
a 
finite 
sequence 
of 
ordinals 
< ~2, 
and 
n < ~(v) ~ 
v(n) + 71(n) is an even ordinal ]. 
Clearly T~ c Nm and Tn c Nm', and the Tn's are pairwise incompatible (in 
Nm and in Nm' ) and there are ~o such Tn's. 
2) Let V satisfy G.C.H. and P = If " f a countable function from 
g to I0,1{{ ordered by inclusion. Suppose in V e , Qis Nm or Nm', and it does 
N 
not satisfy the ~4 -chain condition. 
So there is P0 c P

T (i <to4) , PO ]~-p" each Tbelongsto 
Q(fori

which is easy. 
4.4 I~emma: Nm' satisfies the S-condition for any S such that t~ 2 c S. 
Proof: To show our claim holds we have to describe 
F and then show 
that F does its work. 
At a point 7/ where we use F , F has to determine 
~9~CT(7/), and f (~') for any immediate 
successor 7/' of r/. At such a point f (~?) 
is already known and is a condition in Nm'. 
Let v~ be a point of minimal 
height in f (zl) such that v~ has t~ 2 many immediate successors 
(in f (7/)). Let 
SUCT(~'I) be I~?^<a> : v, ^ <a> cf(~)~ 
and for each 7/ ^ <a in ~c/,(17) let 
f (~? ^ <a>) be the subtree of f (7) consisting of members 
of f (7/) which are 
comparable 
with v~^<a > (in the order of f (~?)). When we want to check that 
our F does the work we are given an S-tree 
T , fronts Jn and a function 
f 
: T-,Nrn' 
as above in 2.6 and we are givena 
subtree 
/~, 
T-* 
7 r 
to find a condition r c/Vm' so that r 1]-" there exists an infinite ~7 such that 
for everyn 
co0 , 77rn c T'andf(~?rn) 
c G': We produce r bypasing 
from 
/~ to a subtree 
T" -> T' such that every point in T" either belongs to some 
front Jn (and thus fits the demands 
of Fn) and is a splitting point, or it has 
exactly one immediate successor. 
Now r is the tree of all the initial segments 
of trunks of f (7/) for some 7/e: T" ~ ( 13 d,~); that is: 
1o. <r 
r =[p:377c( 
IJ Jn) A T" 
such 
that 
p<v~l 
where 
v~ 
is 
from 
the 
<co 
definition of f(~?) according 
to F. 
By the construction, 
if ~71, ~72 are <:- 
incomparable, 
then so are v,i ~ , ~2, hence by the definition of Nm' it is a 
member 
of Nm'. As any p c Nm' forces that "3~7 c Limp 
such that for all n 
the subtree 
defined by ~7 r n belongs to G, it is not hard to see that r is as 
required. 

371 
4.5 Lemma: Any ~l-closed forcing notion satisfies any S-condition. 
Proof: This is trivial, when we are in the relevant situation with an S- 
tree T', 
T~* 
?4 and f 
" T-*P 
we just pickr 
cP 
such thatr-> 
kJf(~Ttr~) 
for some 77 c Lim ~, such r exists by the completeness 
of P and it forces that 
any smaller condition is a member of G, so we are done. 
4.6 Lemma: Let W be a stationary subset of S~ = [a < o a : efa = ~0] and 
let P[ W] = If : f 
is an increasing and continuous 
function from a + 1 into If 
for some a < c01] ordered by inclusion, then P[ If] satisfies the S-condition for 
any S such that II a c S. 
Proof: We define the F and then show why it works. 
Each F(~?) will 
determine 
SUCT(77) to be [~7^<a> : a < c021 and f (~7^<a>) a condition above 
f (7/) such that Max (Rang f (77^<a>)) > a (note that by the definition of P[ W] 
each function which belongs to P[if] has a maximum 
in its range). Let us 
denote Max (Rang f (7/)) by a n. Assume T is an S-tree, Jn fronts, f 
: T -~ P[ W] 
meets 
our requirements 
for F 
(see 2.6) and 
T---" 7 ~. Let C 1 be a closed 
unbounded 
subset 
of ~02 such that 
if ~c C 1 and 77 E iff and 7/E~ 
then 
a n < 6. 
Let 
C 2 
be 
a 
closed 
unbounded 
subset 
of

such 
that 
for 
c C 2 , ~7c 7 r (3( kJ Jn) satisfying 7/c~ 
and a<~ 
there is always some 
a <fl<~ 
such 
that 
77^<~>E T". 
Now 
for 
some 
~?c i~ 
we 
pick 
c C 1 (3 Ca O S such that a n < 6 and construct 
an <~-increasing squence 
<~7~ : n < c0> in r such that Lim an~ = ~ (this is possible as cf 6 = co using the 
definitions of C 1 and Ca). Letv = 
Uf(~?n) 
U~<SupDomf(~Tn),6> 
clearly 
r C P[W] and forces each j' (~,~) to belong to the generic G so we are done.

5.1 Theorem: Let Q0 satisfies the I 0 condition and let Q be a Q0-name of 
a forcing notion such that the weakest condition of Qo forces it to satisfy the 
11 -condition. 
Let/2 be the first regular cardinal strictly greater than all the 
members of I 0 let A be such that h = A <~-> [ Q0 ] and assume that the weakest 
condition of Q0 forces each member of x 1 to be h+-complete, let I be I 0 U 11 
then 
P = Qo * Q1 satisfies the l-condition. 
Remark: Note that 11 c V ( we will not gain much by letting 11 c VQ~ 
Proof: Once again we have to define the function F and then prove it 
does work. We will need a combinatorial lemma and its proof will conclude the 
proof of the theorem. 
For f (71) c P 
we denote by f~ 
its Q0 -part and by 
f I(77) the QI -part ( it is a Q0-name of a condition in QI), let F ~ be the func- 
tion exemplifying Q0 satisfies the I 0 condition and F be the Q0-name of the 
function exemplifying Q satisfies the ;1-condition. 
N1 
We divide the definition of the F to even and odd stages. 
In even stages 
i.e., when ]w I = m 
=21:, we will refer to the Q0 part of P and use p-o More pre- 
cisely, 
let 
<B,l,v<rv:vcH>> 
= 
Fw~ (~7,<f~163 
where 
wl = le~ w: le n wl 
even

Now 
SUCr(*7) = B 
and 
for 
v 9 B 
, v c B, 
ll(v) = f l(v ), f~ 
= r,,. In odd stages we essentially do the same for the 
O -part but we need a little modification; F 1 is just a name of a function and 
we may not even know its domain, so first we extend f~ 
to a condition 
q0 
f~ 
-<- q0 r Q0 
forcing a specific value for I n (hence for Sucr(v) ) as 

373 
defined by F ~ , and then proceed like in Q0 part (of course we change each 
f~ 
there to f~(~?) and so on ) and we let the Q0 part 
f0(~?') for each 
~'~ S~cr(~7) be the q0 we have picked (the 
Q 
part will be defined by 
r~(---)). 
Before we can show that this definition works we need a definition and a 
combinatorial lemma. 
5.2 Definition: For a subset A of T we define by induction on the length 
of 77, resr(A,~7) for each ~7 c T. Let rest(A,<> ) = <>. 
Assume resr(A,~?) is 
already defined and we define resr(A,l?^<a>) 
for all members ~? ^ <a> of 
Sucr(7/). 
If 7/ E A then reST(A,~?^<a>) = ves~.(A,7) ~ <a> and if ~? f~ A then 
Sucr(A,~?^<a>) = vesr(A,~?) ^ <0>. Thus ~vesr(A,~7) : 71 ~ T] is a t]ree obtained 
by projecting, i.e., gluing together all members of SucT(~?) whenever ~? g A. 
[J.3 Lemma: Let A,/~ be cardinals satisfying A <u = A and let (T,I) be a 
tree in which for each ~? c T either I Sucr(7?) ] < ~ or I(~7) is A+-complete, Then 
for every function H:T 
~ A there 
exist 
~ 
, (T,l)--<~ (7~,I) such that for 
~7,~7' c 7 r reST(A,~7) = reST(A,~7') implies H(~) = H(~7') and ~7 c A iff 71' c A, where 
A = ~n c T : I Sucr(n) ] < l~l. 
Continuation 
of the proof of 5.1: Using the lemma let us prove the 
theorem. 
So we are given (T,I) , .1',,In as in 2.6, (T,I) -<" (T',I) 
j0 : T -* Q0 as 
a 
function 
to

(remember 
]Qo]-<)Q- 
By 
the 
temma 
for 
every 
(/~,I) 
~* (7r 
there 
is a subtree 
T',(/~,I)~ ~ (7~',I) such that 
for every 
~7#7' c T" : fo(~?) = j,o(7?')(T,I) , 
and 
~7 c A 
iff 
7/' c A 
whenever 
resy(A,71)=resr(A,*?' ) 
(as 
in 
the 
lelnma 
A 
is 
[Zl: ]SucT(~7)l <#]). 
Now 
T* = Iresr(A,~) : 7/c 7 ~' ] is an lo-tree and fo induces a function j?o from it to 
Q0 i.e., v = resr(A,n) implies f~ 
= f (n) (by the conclusion of 5.3, fo is well 
defined). By the definition of F for even Iwl's and the assumption that F ~ 
exemplify the Xo-condition we can find an r o c Qo such that r o ]]"Qo "~ is in 
JAmT and for every k ca3 fi~ 
G "" 
where 77 is a Qo -name of a 
N

member of JAm T* and G is the Qo- name for the generic subset of Qo. Let 
N0 

374 
T+~=~ 9 T" : res(A,~) = res(A,~7)l, it is a Q0-name of an Ii-tree and by the

definition of F in the odd stages there 
in a Q0-name r

of a member

P = Oo * O which exemplifies that the l-condition holds is of course 
o,~o 
We now pay our debt and prove lemma 5.3; the proof is in the spirit of the 
proofs of the previous combinatorial lemmas 3.3 and 3.5. 
Proof of Lernl~a 5.3: We start with a successor 1~, in such cases there is 
a cardinal 
~ such that 
/r = ~+ and for each vl e T 
resT(A,~) 9 ~>~. 
Let 
l<ha,ga> 
: a < }`] be a list of all the pairs such that ga is a function from ~>~: 
to |0,1] and h a is in a function from ~ to }` (by the assumption 
},<" = }` there 
are at most }` such pairs). For each a < }` we define a game G a just like in the 
proof of 3.5, except that now player I wins if for the ~7 e Lira T that he con- 
structed 
along 
the 
play 
7/r k 9 A 
iff 
ga(resr(A,7? r k)) = 0 
and 
ha(resT(A,~ 7~k)) =H(~Trk) for everyk 
<r 
If for everya<}`playerlIhasa 
winning strategy we would build a subtree 
T ~ by induction on the height of 
~7 e T taking into T* all members of NUCT(~) when 17 e A , and otherwise pick- 
ing as the only member of Suet(T/) an element of SucT(~) that is not in any of 
the Aa's that are defined for player II at that stage by his winning strategy for 
G a (this is possible as we assume that ~/ ~ A implies I,I is },+-complete). 
T" is 
isomorphic to a subtree of IresT(A,~7): 7) 9 T] so there is a pair < hao,gao > in 
our list such that for each 11 9 T ~ H(~) = hao(resr(A,~?)) and gao(~l) = 0 iff 
17 e A. Now in the game Ga0, player l could and plays choosing only members 
of T" while II plays according 
to his winning strategy for G a, but in such a 
play , player I surely wins and we get the desired contradiction. 
So there 
exists some p < }` for which I has a winning strategy for G~ and we define iff 
according to this strategy just like we did in the proof of 3.5. 

375 
If /z is limit, we first use Lemma 3.5 to find 7~,( T,[) <-* (2e,I), and #' </z 
such that for every 7} 9 7 ~. I. is A+-complete or ] Sucr(~? ) ] ~/*'.

] (we can use 
some variants, but there is no need ). 
(1) Q is a RCS iteration. 
(2) Pij = Pj/ Pi satisfies the I,j-condition 
for < i,j> 9 W*. 
(3) for every I 9 xi, j, UI

I is A~-complete,

6.2 
Lemma: 
If 
Q = ~ Pn,Q 
-n < co> 
is 
suitable 
for 
<l~,j,~.j,/z~d:i < j < ~>, and I= 
U In,n+l then P~ = Raim Q satisfies the I 
-condition. 
Proof: Let I n = ln,n+l 
A~ = A,.,+ 1 /z i =/z/,i+ 1, note that P~.i+l = Q. so 
Q satisfies the l~-condition, 
I P~ I < ~ 
, N~ <- A.~+I =/~+1 <~ <~+I- 
For each i <~, let F 
be a Pt-name 
of a witness to Q satisfies the I i- 
condition. 
We will act as in the proof of Theorem 5.1, but now we have count- 
ably many F's 
rather 
than two. We can apriori partition the tasks, so let 
co = U A~, the A~ pairwise disjoint , each A, infinite. 

376 
Now we shall define the function F which exemplifies "P~ satisfies the I - 
condition. " So we have to define F(~?,w,fr~v:v < r/I). 
(see Definition. 2.6). 
Leti be the uniquei 
<~suchthat 
]w(~)] ~At, letw ~ 
~ ~w:lg Nw] ~A~]. 
and let < I<," :~B> > : F (,, w" <.r (n~)(~):~ --,~(,,)>) We ehoose ~ ~ P, 
such that (f (~?)ri) - qn and for some ~, 
%ll-e, " I BI = %" and q~li-e,"/is ~" 
by the natural isomorphism f. 
{see 
2.3.). 
We choose SUCT(~?) = ~7^<a>:a < Uln~, and define: 
F(~q,w(~?);<f(vts163 <- s 
= <..~.~< 
Up~ g 
q
~
:
v
[

r 
~Suc(~7)>>. 
[really we 
should replace ~~ by the function I(~,L)I, but we shall ignore such prob- 
lems ]. 
We now have to prove that Po, I, and F satisfy Definition 2.6. So let (7,I), 
Jk(~ < r 
and f'T ~ P be as in Definition 2.6 and T_<" T o and we have to find 
a p cP, 
pIp':~T/cLimTO 
such that 
(Vk <aJ)f(~Trk)cG 
". 
W.l.o.g. for 
~ PiP 
some B~ C 
(vvc TO)[/. c tk <=> ~(n) cBk] 
We shall now define by induction on k <~, a tree 7 ~, T ~ ~" 7 ~+1. T O is 
already defined, and if T k is defined, apply on it (as an i-tree ) Lemma 5.3, for 
= Ak+l, /~ =/~k and the function Hk (~7) = f (7/)r(k +1). We should observe now 
that T* = (~ T ~ satisfies T~ <* T ~ for every k; the reason is that for each 
~7 c T~ 
belong to a unique I k, hence Sucr~(~/) = Suc/,§ 
for each g -> k+2, 
hence SUCT-(T/) = Suc~.e(N). Also <> c T ~ so really T ~ -* T ~ for every/r 
Let 
T~ = ~resT,(Ak,l?):~ 7 C T'] where A k = |7/.:~ c Ulig~, and f;:Tk*-* ~kQ is defined 
by: 
f~(resr,(Ak,~?))= p 
iff 
f(W)(k) =p 
Now we can define p(i) c Q., 71. a P*+I -name, by induction on i, such 
that: 

377 
<p (0) ..... 
p (i)> I 
c LimT; 
is 
such 
that 
for 
every 
I~ < co , /k*(n.ts 9 a 
and ifs 9 
, s <ithenni(s 
:n,(s 
and <p(i):i 
< co> 9 Po and ~, where ~(s 
is 17~(s ) for every i large enough, 
are as required. 
6.3 Lemrna: 
l) If Q : <Pa, Q :a < col> is suitable for 
~Q 
<Ia,p,Aa,p,tza,p:a < ~ < ah,a non limit >, and I = UIlr 
< 3 < col, i non limit ] 
tAen Y = PG,, = RLimQ 
satisfies the l-condition. 
2) For P = RLi~Q as above, 
U Pa is a dense subset of .P. 
a<o, 
3) We can replace col by an ~ such that cf y~ <A4 J for any<i,j> 9 W*. 
(4) For Q =<P~,~-i 
<~> as in (3), if ~~is a P~-name of anco-sequence 
of ordinals (P~=RLim Q, of coursep 9 
then for somei < ~ , q ePi, and 
5 a Pi-name of an co-sequence of ordinals, P8 ~ "P -< q " and q [~-Pm "a = b'. 
Proof: 
i) 
For 
each 
p 9 P 
choose 
a 
fixed 
enumeration 
p = [p[~]:I~ < col , p[I~] an atomic condition of P, {.(p[JZ]) the V-named ordinal 
associated with p[I~] (see X Def. 1.2 (c)). Let ~ = U At,j , the Atj infinite 
pairwise disjoint , be such that 
(Vg 9 
^2" ~g), 
and 
for 
each 
a , c0~a <col 
let 
I<~'(iZ,a),a(s163 
< ~] be a list of all pairs <i,2" > , i < j < a , i non limit. 
Let Fij be Pi-name of a function exemplifying "R- 9 
~,; satisfies the li, 
j- 
condition. " 
Let us explain our strategy, we cannot deal with all pairs (i,j) along a 
branch as the branch is countable, and i,j < col- So along each branch ~] we 
try to determine 
the Q-named ordinals {'(f (7/t~)[m]), so we get a bound to 
N 
larger and larger parts of each f (~Tr(g)) and we shall try to deal with all F 
for i,j smaller than the bound. 

378 
We shall 
define 
the 
function 
F 
which 
exemplify 
"P 
satisfies 
the I- 
condition, 
" so we have to define F(~/,w,(f(wt~):s 
Naturally we 
shall use one of the F 
, but we have to determine which one. By the way we 
are defining F, we can assume that for/r ~w, k < ~(~/), f(nt(/c+/)) 
determine 
~(f(~/~s 
for 
s 
</r 
so 
we 
can 
define 
a0(~/) = ~, 
and 
for 
/c > 0 
a~(V) = Max l~+~(f (~Tr~)l'~]+/c:s 
~/el U ~ 
+/r 
lastly 
let 
for 
/c EwuIs 
(i(/c),m(/c)) 
be 
the 
unique 
pair (i,m) 
such 
that 
[w(~/c ] : A~. m. We know that i(/c) < lwN/c ] _</c, hence ar 
is well defined. 
Let 
a) w*--w; 
be ~lc <s 
, m(/c))=(i(s 
, m(s 
:. 
b) 7(~7) = T(m (s (~/)) , a~(s

F~(,~,,(=)(~,~',~ (~r~)r[7(m (~),~(~)(~)) 
, ~(m (~),:~(~)(~)))) 
( recall 7(~),e(~) depends on more variables which we suppress for notational 
1 ! 
it/ 
simplicity ). Now choose q~ >-f (7/)t7(77) , q~ c PT(~) such that q~lI-pT(~ ) 
is 
isomorphic 
to/_~, J~ c IT(~),~(n)", and choose 
qo > f (77) U q~ such it deter- 
mines ~(f (7/ts 
for s ,m < ~ (~/) and let 
Now we have to prove that P,I and F satisfy Def. 2.6. So let (T~,J~(& < co) 
and f 
be as in Def. 2.6, and T<* T t and we have to find the requiredp. 
Define 
a 
function 
g :T -* ~1 
by: 
g (77) 
is 
the 
maximum 
of 
e0§163 
[m] +s 
~+s 
for s 
<~(~), 
as forced by q0 
(remember 
qo < 3" (v) whenever 7/<~ v c T). Note that by the way we have defined g(~/), 
<v~g(~7) 
<g(v). 
So by Lemma 3.3 there is ~ff' , Ttg" T" such that for 
some a < co 1, for every 7/ E Lim~', a = U g(~Trn) (remember 
I is ~2-complete, 
T 
an 
I-tree). 
So 
necessarily 
a 
is 
limit, 
and 
choose 
0=fl(0) 
<fl(1) <...<fl(n) 
<~(n+l) 
<.-. 
<a, 
U~(n) =a 
, no ~(n) is limit. 
Now we 
can 
shrink 
7 ~', so 
as 
to 
use 
only Fp(n),~(n+l)(n < r 
i.e. 
let 

379 
Jn = i~7 9 T:(16(n),~(~z+l)) = (T(r/),r 
and T 0, T" ---- T o be such that: 
if V 9 TO,~7 9 YJn 
then (Va)(~7~<a> 9 T" -~ r/^<a> 9 0) 
if 77 9 TO,~? ~ yJn then (3!a)(~?^<a> 9 T ~ 
Now as in the proof of 6.2 we define by induction on n T~; T ~ -:* T~+I,T ~ is 
already defined and if T ~ is defined apply on it, as an l-tree, Lemma 5.3 for 
A = k~(~+1),a(~+2 ) , /z =/za(tc),a(~+l) and the function H~ , H~(~7) = f (~?)tfl(/c +1). 
Again 
T~ = A T~ 
satisfies 
T~ -<~ T ~ 
for 
every 
k. 
We 
let 
T~*

f~(reST'( (3 As

on n, Pn ~P#(n+l)

hence, by the definition of RCS, as a is limit:

We have here a problem: f (~Tt~) is not necessarily in Pa, (only in P~,) so 
f (~t~)ta c G 
is less then required. 
However f (r/r~) = If (~t~) [m]:m < ~], 
~..~ a 
f(~?rs [m] 
is 
a 
Q-named

(i.e., 
an

But 
q~

stationary 
Remark: Our proof will use, in addition to the ideas of the proof of 
Theorem 1.4 also ideas of the proof of Harrington and Shelah [H S], but, for 
making the iteration work, build a quite generic object rather than forcing it 
(as in [Sh 81]). 
2) In b) we can omit G.C.H. (using XII w for a) ------> b) ). 
Proof: The implication b) -------> a) was proved by Van Lere, using the well 
known fact that if in L there is no Mahlo cardinal, then the square principle 
holds for I~ 2. So the point is to prove a) ------> b) . As any Mahlo cardinal in V is 
a Mahlo cardinal in L, we can assume V = L, ~ a strongly inaccessible Mahlo 
cardinal. 
We shall define a revised countable support iteration Q = <Pi,Q." i < ~>, 
[P~] --l~+ 1. If i is not a strongly inaccessible cardinal Q. is the Levi collapse 

389 
of 2 M~ to ~l by countable conditions. If i is strongly inaccessible then Q. is P[S 
S 
a P~-name of a stationary subset of ~0 (note [[-p~ "i = t~ 2'~, where S will 
~i 
~4, 
be carefully chosen later. 
We 
let 
P~ = RLim Q, 
and 
in 
V v" we 
define 
an 
iterated 
forcing 
(P~*,Q*: i < r 
with support of power t~ 1, such that (in V p') for each i, 
S ~ 
is a Pi*-name of a subset of S a which does not contain a closed copy of G01, 
and 
Q"= If ~- VP") P~': f 
a + : < ~a into ~a - S~'i 
an 
increasing 
continuous 
function 
from 
some 
(so Q. makes S~'non stationary ). 
We shall prove that (if the S's were chosen suitably) then: 
(*) For every a < g+, forcing by P~ does not add new col-sequences (to 
V P') and P~" contains a dense subset of power -- ~a (everything in VP'). 
Clearly P~. satisfies the r 
condition, so by a suitable bookkeeping 
every P~.-name of S* ~ S~ which does not contain a closed copy of ~1 is S* 
for some i. We can conclude that it is enough to prove (*). 
So let a < r 
, 1o ~ P~, and T be a Pa-name 
of a function from ~1 to 
N 
ordinals. 
For all those things we have Pc-names, (but a is fixed). Now in V we can 
define an increasing continuous sequence Ni(i < ~) of elementary submodels 
of 
(H(r 
such 
that 
P~, 
and 
all 
names 
involved 
belong 
to 
N 0, 
( N i : i <- j> c Nj+ 1 , Nj+liseountableclosed. 
Now in V, as V = L, 0 
IX < ~ : A is strongly inacessible ~ holds, so we have 
guessed <Ni: i ~ ~,> , 7,.-- 
in stage ~ , (UN~) C~ r = Nx = ~,, up to isomor- 
phism over ~. We shall work in V i%, (so we "know" e.g. Pa f~ ( LJ Nj)) and show 

390 
that: 
(**) there 
is 79 
(a+l) 
and there 
are qi c(uNj)

q0 = P, increasing such that: 
(i < x), 
(a) when 7 = a 
, q~,+l force a value for T(/); and 
(b) for every t6 9 Dora q~, for some f 9 V P~'

and 
(c) and if 7 < a then qi {~-"S" N i = S~,~." 
N 7

and U S~,~. is a stationary 
This is enough, because in any case q = U q, 9 Pr 
(the non continuity is in 
'~<A 
eofinality co cases). 
Now if we suppose that always 7 = a" 
then (a) implies 
that q 9 P~, determine 2; so the first part of (**) holds; also by (b) q satisfies. 
9 
for fl9 
, qtfl determine q(p) (i.e., as a function in (V P') rather 
than as a Pa-name), 
so the set of q's satisfing @ is dense in P., but their number (in V P') is 
~, as ]Dom q[ < ~. (remember <P~,Q.*: i < ~+> was a usual, not revised, 
N% 
( < ~) -support iteration). So we have completed the proof of (*). 
But what if in some case 7 < a? then we would have chosen SA = U S~, 
i<A 
(see (c) above ) so q = Uq~ c Pa force S" contains a closed copy of w 1, con- 
~<~ 
~P 
tradietion. 
So here comes the only restriction on the choice of S c (S02) vp~. 
~A 
So we have only to prove (**), and this is done by proving a stronger 
assertion by induction on 7, similarly to the proof in IV (see [Sh 80d ] , so we 
just explicate what has to be proved by induction. 

As in 
sequence 
(9") 
391 
VP~', ~ais A, and 0|~<~cf ~=~d h~ 
can define for eachi <A a 
< qi,t: ~ < i> such that: 
every initial segment of this sequence belongs to Ni. 
qi,t E N i N P-*, is increasing with ~. 
if <qt: ~ < A> satisfies (fl) [i.e., it is increasing with ~ and 
n P:)] then li:<q~:~<i> 
=<qi,(: ~ < /> { is statiOnary. 
Note that Nh is closed under taking/-sequences (in V PA) for i < h. 
Now it is not clear whether < q~,~: ~ < i> has an upper bound in P~ how- 
ever we can find a(i) eN~ n (a+ 1) and 
q(eN;~ nP~(r 
q~'~qr 
for

Now we can also demand that q~" force a value some P,'(~)-name of an ordinal 
in Ni which no q~,t r a(i) have determined, if there is such a name. 
Now 
we 
define 
by 
induction

We define an RSC-iteration Q = < P,,Q.: i < K:>, where: 
i) if i is not strongly inaccessible, Q is Levi collapse of 2Stto R 1

2) if i is strongly inaccessible but not Mahlo, Q = Nm'. 
3) if { is strongly inaccessible Mahlo cardinal. 
Q = P[S~] where 
S~ = [A < i : A strongly inaccessible ] 

393 
It should be easy for the reader to prove that Pc = RLim Q satisfies the 
t-chain condition, and the S-condition, S = 121 : ~1 < ;k < ~,h inaccessible (in 
L)]. 
Let P" = tf : f 
an increasing continuous function from some a + 1 < ~2 =

Now P* is not even ~l-complete, but still P was constructed so that P" does 
not add ~vsequences, and V P" * P" is as required. 

XII NOTES ON IMPROPER FORCING 
w Introduction: 
In X we prove general theorems on semi-proper forcing notions, and itera- 
tions. We use them by iterating several forcing, one of them, and an impor- 
tant one, is Namba forcing. But to show Namba forcing is semi-proper, we 
need essentially that S2 is in a large cardinal which was collapsed to B2 ( more 
exactly - a consequente of this on Galvin games). In XI we take great trouble 
to use a notion considerably more complicated than semi-properness which is 
satisfied by Namba forcing. However it was not clear whether all this is neces- 
sary as we do not exclude the possibility that Namba forcing is always semi- 
proper, or at least some other forcing, fulfilling the main function of Namba 
forcing (i.e., making the cofinality of ~2 to ~ without collapsing t~l). But we 
prove in 1.2 here, that: there is such semi-proper forcing, iff Namba forcing is 
semi-proper, iff player H wins Gm(ISl],c0,t~2) ( a game similar to Galvin games ) 
and, in 1.3 , that this implies Chang conjecture. Now it is well known that 
Chang conjecture implies 0 ~ exists, so e.g., in ZFC we cannot prove the 
existence of such semi-proper forcing. An amusing consequence is that if we 
collapse a measurable cardinal to ~ by Levi-collapsing P, then Chang conjec- 
ture holds as by X 6.13 in V P player II wins the game mentioned above 
(Silver's original proof, uses a Ramsey cardinal, but he has first to force 
MA + L #~ > t~, and then use a more complicated collapsing). 
In section 2 we give to the various variants of properness equivalent form 
by games; and show how the preservation theorems sound in this setting. 
Such games have been investigated by Jech (which are like Galvin games, but 
using complete Boolean algebras) but his interests were different. 
Now the condition suggested in XI has some drawbaeks: it can be satisfied 
by a forcing notion P but not by another equivalent forcing notion and it was 
satisfied by few forcing notions. In particular any forcing notion satisfying it

does not add reals, which hampers the proof of IX l.x . So in section 3 we 
suggest a more general notion UP 0 which is satisfied by Namba forcing and 
every proper forcing notion, implies ~1 is not collapsed. 
w 1 When is Namba forcing semi-proper. Chang conjecture and games. 
1.1 Definition: For a filter D on a set I, and a set S of regular cardinals 
and ordinal a we define a game Gm(S,a,D): in the flth move player I chooses a 
cardinal Ap ~ S and a function Fp from I to A~. 
Then player II has to choose an ordinal i~ < h~. In the end of the game, 
player II wins if 
|t E I: for every A c S, if for some p, A = Ap then Sup [Fp(t)),p = A] is 
Sup lip : h a = X]{ ~ Cmod D; also player I has to choose each Ap infinitely 
often otherwise player II wins. (though not every A ~ S appears). 
If I = ~,, P = D~ b (the filter of cobounded subsets of A) we replace D by A. 
Remark: 1) This is close to Galvin games, see Definition 4.9; and refer- 
ence there. 
2) We do not list the obvious monotonicity properties. 
1.2 Theorem : 1) Namba forcing is ~l]-semi-proper 
iff Player II wins 
Grn (~ ],c0,~2) iff there is a l~ 1 ]- semi-proper forcing P changing the cofinality 
of ~ to X 0. 
2) For a countable set S of regular uncountable 
cardinals, 
player II wins Grn(i~l],~,S ) iff there is an I~l]-serni proper forcing P, I[-p"(V 
~cS) 
cf ~ =Mo': 
Remark: 1) We have not looked into the case S is uncountable. 
2) It does not matter whether we use Nm or Nm', (see XI ) so we 
deal with the somewhat harder case : Nm. 

396 
Proof: 1) We use the criterion for semi-properness 
from 2.8 (nexL sec- 
tion) 
third implies second condition 
We assume P is [~11 semi-proper; and so (by 2.8) we can choose a winning 
strategy for player II in PG = PG~o,P,I~I]) 
and we call its players Ipc,IIp~ 
for 
clearness. 
Now we 
describe 
a 
winning 
strategy 
for 
player 
II in 
Grn(II~z],~,bt2). Player II will simulate for this a play of PG, in which I[pc uses 
his winning strategy and Ipc is played by him. Let ~ 
be the P-name 
of the 
nth element in an ~-sequence which is unbounded in 1~ a. 
tn the nth move let player I choose Fn:~ 2 ~ ~t, Player II will play for Ipc 
the P-names 
Fn(~jg)(~ < ~), (see 2.3 ), so he knows the ordinals an, g < ~1 
which IIp~ plays (according to his strategy). 
Now player II return to his play 
and choose the move a n = Sup [an,t~ + l:g < ~l. 
In the end there is a condition p c P, 
for n, ~ < o. Let 
p ->p0 , p 
IF 
< Wan 
" 
A~ = la < ~a:P does not force ~ 
# a, i.e., there is q c P 
p---q,q 
By our choice of ~(Jg < c0) for some s AE is an unbounded subset of c0 2 (or 
U Ag is bounded, 
as in V cf (co2)=~2 >~Io). 
Now clearly a c A~ implies 
Fn (a) < Uam; hence A~ is as required. 
Trivial 
First implies third condition 
Second condition implies first c~ndition 
The proof is similar to that of X 4.11(3) 

397 
We again use the games and prove player II wins PG~,P;Sl] for everyp 9 P, 
cb 
P = Nm = Nm 
(%,) (see X Definition 4.4(4) (we can in fact replace Sl by |A:A 
a regular cardinal ~ Se]). For notational simplicity assume p's trunk is <> 
i.e. (vn 
During the play, in the nth move player I choose a P-name of a countable 
ordinal ~ , and player II will choose ~n < co~. In the side, player II in stage n 
~n 
also choose a condition Pn ~ P and a function Fn from Pn ~ (n"~2) to ~ 
such that: 
a) p <-Po,Pn <-Pn+l, Pn N (~:"~2) =P,z+l N ('~c02), the trunk of

b) 
For

and 
s < ~z, 
either 
(Pn+l)[n] ]l-P"~6 -< Fn(W)"or there is no q, (Pn)[~] - q, with trunk 71 and f < wl, 
such that q ]]-p"~ == (': 
c) For 7/ epn N (m~2), m <n 
let F.,~:~ 2 -. ~I be defined by 
F,~,.(i) =Fn07^<i>); 
and we demand 
that 
Fn(~/) is defined 
such 
that 
is 
an 
initial 
segment 
of 
a 
play 
of 
Grn (ISa],c0,Sl) in which the second player use his winning strategy. 
d) At last player II actually play {'n = F~ (< > ) 
There is no problem for player II to use this strategy: in stage 0 , - trivial 
stage n+l: for each ~6p~ 
C~(~+*~z) 
define q~,~ by induction on 
- g+l _> q~,n, has trunk ~7 and either it force ~ -- {" for 
s <-- n+l:qO.n = (Pn)[,i], ~/,i.n 
some ~ < ~1 which we call f~,n or there is no such q (satisfying the two previ- 
ous conditions ). Then 
~+I. 
P~+~ = U|q,.~ .,I ep~ N (~2)}. 
and for r/epn 
f~ (nr 
F,~+I(W ) = Max I~"~.n:s <-- ~%+I.('~.,~ well defined I U IO] - 

398 
Now he define Fn+l(~) for ~7 cPn 
n (n>e~ 
=Pn+l n (n>coe) by downward 
induction on g (7/). Using c) (i.e., the winning strategy of the second player in 
or~ (l~21,~,s1).) 
In the end player II has to provide the suitable condition q -> p; we define 
q CI nco2 by induction on n: 
<> C q, 
and 
if 
have 
decided 
that 
r/cq 
then 
r/^<i> 
c q 
iff 
SuplFn(~?^<i>):n 
<r

nmlZCn)l 
By c) q will be a condition; and by b) it force ~ 
< 
U {'n (otherwise there 
isr->q,r 
I]-p"~ 
-> U~n" 
let~Tbethe 
trunk ofr, and then using b) weget 
a contradiction. 
2) The "if" part is as in the proof of 1). For the "only if" part let 
[;kn:n < c01 be a list of S, each h c S appearing 
infinitely often, and let 
P = Nm(T),T 
= [~/:~ a finite sequence, ~(g) < ~], using X 4.::(3). 
1.3 Theorem: 1) If player II wins C,m : Gm(ll~ll,col,I~a), then Chang con- 
jecture holds. 
2) Moreover if e.g. X > 2#~, M* an expansion of <H(x),c > by 
Skolem functions, N ~ M ~ is countable, then for arbitrarily large a < l~ 2, there 
is Na,N ~ N a -4 M*, a c Na, and N a, N have the same countable ordinals. 
Proof: 1) Follows easily from 2). 
2) Clearly some winning strategy for II in Gm belong to N. So we 
can construct a play of Gin, F0,a0,Fl,a I, 9 - 9 such that player II uses his stra- 
tegy, each Y n belong to N, and every function from co 2 to c01 which belong to 
N appear in [Fn:n < r I. 
As the strategy and F 0 ..... 
F n belong to N, also a n belong to N. 
In the 
end for arbitrarily large a < I~ 2, F n (a) < Uam for every n. But clearly N (3 r 

399 
is an initial segment of ~l, hence Uam c N, so Fn(a ) e N for every a satisfy- 
WI 
ing/~ 
F~(a) < Uam. 
Now we can take as N a the Skolem hull of N U la]; just 
remember 
that for every term "r(x,a l, - 9 - ) a l, 9 - 9 9 N, there is f :co 2 -~ co l, in 
N, such that 
(Vs163 < co 2 ^ T(s 
) < co 1 -* T(/,al,.. ) = f(s 
3) We can prove similar theorems for S not necessarily ~Bl], e.g. 
1.4 Theorem: 
If player II wins Gm(IA],c0,~l A <~ 
, M a model with 
universe H((2~) +) and countably many relations and functions, including e 
and Skolem functions, N < M countable, then there is Nt,N < Nt < M, Nt ~ N, 
Sup (Nt C~ A) = Sup (N C~ A), Sup (A rt C~ ~) > Sup (g C~ #), and ]Nt 6~/1,] =Bl- 
1.5 Conclusion: For some regular A, player II wins in Gm(ISi],c~,k ) iff 
there is an ISl]-semi proper forcing P not preserving "cf a > S 0 ". 
2) So if e.g. 0 # does not exist a forcing notion is proper iff it is 
semi-proper. 
Proof: 1) first --------> second 
: By 1.2(2) 
second --------> first: By 1.2(2) 
2) If P is semi-proper and preserve "cf (a) > ~0" then by Claim X 
23(1) P is proper 
(see Definition X 2.2, the S from Definition X 2.1 is essen- 
N 
tially equal to the S from Claim X 2.3(1) because P preserves "cf a > S0 '1- 
If P is semi-proper not preserving "ef a > I~ 0'' then for some p e P, and 
regular 
A > M I 
(in 
V) 
Q = P r ~q E P : p ~ q I is 
senti-proper 
and 
~b l~-q"cf~k=M0". 
But then by 1.5 player II wins the game Ccrn(|bll],C01A 
) 
hence by the conclusion of Theorem 1.4 holds and by well known theorems 
such variants of Chang conjecture implies 0 # E V. 
Note that by 1.g and X 4. i0" 

400 
1.5 Conclusion: If ~ is measurable in V,P is Levi collapsing of ~ to l~ 2 (by 
countable functions) then in V P, Chang conjecture holds.

Games and Properness 
2.1 Theorem: A forcing notion P is proper iff player II has a winning 
strategy in the game PG~(p ,P), for every p, where 
2.2 Definition: In a play of the game PGa~ ,P) (a a limit ordinal), 
(p c P) in the flth move player I chooses a P-name ~a of an ordinal, and 
player II chooses an ordinal {~. 
In the end player Ilwins if there is q,p-q 
cP, 
q ]~-" for everyfl<a 
~ c ~r 
< ~], and player I wins otherwise. 
2.3 Claim= Note that we can allow player II to choose countably many 
ordinals ~,~(~ < co) and demand q I}-"~ e I~ +n, :n,s < ~] " Similarly player 
I can choose countably many P-names, and nothing is changed, i.e., the four 
variants of the definition, together satisfies (or does not satisfy ) "player l [II] 
has a winning strategy". 
Proof of 2.1: 
The "if" part 
Let ~ be big enough, N ~ <H(~,),c> is countable, P,p E N,p E P. Then a 
winning strategy of PG~(p,P) belong to N. So there is a play of this game 
,{'n(n < ~) in which player II use his winning strategy in choosing {'n c N 
N n 
and every P-name ~ of an ordinal which belong to N appear in !~ :~z < c0] and 
N 
each $ 
belong to N. So clearly Cn ~ N for every n. 
So 
there 
is 
q, 
witnessing 
the 
victory 
of 
II, 
i.e., 
p -~ q E P, 
q I~-"~ c[~m:m <col" ( for every n), but {~ ~N, soq ~-"~ 
ENforevery 

401 
n " as !~ :n < ~] list all P-names 
of ordinals which belong to N,q is (N,P)- 
generic; and q -> p, so we finish. 
The 
only if part 
For X big enough, expand < H(X),c> by Skolem functions and get a model 
M" and we shall describe a strategy for lh If player I has chosen up to now 
~0 ..... 
~ , let N n be the Skolem hull of ~p,Pt U I~ 0 ..... 
~ | in M*, and 
[r163 :~ < ~l will be the set of ordinals which belong to N n (remember 
claim 
2.3). 
Suppose X0,r163 
< a), X1,r 
< ~), -- 9 is a play in which player II uses 
his strategy. 
Why does he win? Clearly N = UNn, which is the Skolem hull in 
n 
M* of [p,P] U |X:s < ~], is an elementary submodel of M*, (similarly for the 
reducts) 
so 
there 
is 
q -> p 
which 
is 
(N,P)-generic, 
so 
as 
X 9 
q ]~-"X 9 
the set of ordinals of Nis ICn,g:n,~ <c0]. So we 
finish. 
2.4 Definition: 1) PGa(p,P,A) is defined similarly, but X F are P-names of 
ordinals < A. For A = ~ (or just X > I P]) we get PGa(p,P). 
2) For a set S of cardinals, the game PGa(p,P,S) is defined as 
follows: in the /~th move player I choose X F c S, and a P-namc X , and player 
~p 
II chooses for T <-/~ subsets AF, 7 of power <XT(AF, 7 c V) ( for AF regular this is 
, w.l.o.g, an initial segment of AF). 
In 
the 
end 
player 
II wins

that

player I choose X F (not a P-name), and in the end, q force only that if ~F E S 
then

If not said otherwise we restrict ourselves to sets of regular cardinals in V 
Remark: Note that 1) is in fact a special case of 2) when we identify ]k 
with I/z:~ t -/z -~ k,/z regular I- 
2.5 Definition: 1) PG~(p ,P,A) is defined similarly for s = 0,1,2, but: 
forg = 0 it is exactly PGa(p ,P,~); 
for • = 1 player I chooses one (Xa) 
P-name of an ordinal < ~ player II

q []-"Xp, n E |~p,g:s < r

2) PG~(p,P,S) is defined similarly for s = 0,1,2. 
(but for s = 2 
player l chooses in stage fl, ~p,n , Xp.n)- 
2.6 Claim= 1) Player II wins PG~ (p ,P,k) iff he wins PG~ (p ,P,A) provided 
that ~ =~z or k B~ = ~, or at least there is in V a family [A~:i < ~] of countable 
subsets of h such that in V 
(YA ck)(~i) ([A[ <-~0-*A cA~). 
2) Player II wins PG~(p,P%S) iff he wins PG~(p,P,~) (when Sis a 
P-name of a set of regular cardinals > ~0)- 
Proof: 2) The "if" part is trivial. 
For the "only if" part of player l choose kp 
[X,n:n < ~, player lI "pre- 
tend" player I have chosen Sup |Xp,, :n < w], and choose a suitable initial seg- 
ment of AS. So he translates a play of PG~ (p ,P,A) to one of "PG~ (p ,P,A)"

1) Really the same as of 2): the "if" part is trivial and for the 
"only if" part, player II let i

2.7 Theorem: 1) P is a-proper iff player II wins PG6'(I+a)~o,P;~) for 
every p 
2) P is (a,1)-proper iff player II wins PG~ (p,P;~) for every p. 
3) P is IS]-semi a-proper iff player II wins PG~O+a)~p,P;S). 
Proof: Similar to 2.1, for 2) use V 3.10. 
Remark: 1) On "P is S-semi a-proper "see X w 
2) 
For countable 
ordinals

equivalent to demanding ~p,n < Sup I~'p,n:n < a~], etc. 
2.8 Theorernc The property " player II wins PG~ ~o ,P,h) for every p "is 
preserved by CS iterations <P~,Q:i < a(*)>, for s = 0,2 
a < ~1 if la(*)l < 
Remark: 1) So we get here an alternative proof of the preservation of 
(a, 1)- properness: we could give such proofs for other theorems as well. 
2) The situation is similar with S instead ~, and easier for RCS 
iteration by X 2.5. 
Proof: Let (P~,Q.:i < a(')> 
be a countable support iteration. 
Let us 
N$ 
consider a game PG~ (p ,Pa(,) , ~.) (the others are similar). 

404 
By the hypothesis for each i < a(*), player II has a winning strategy G 
~i 
play PG~ (I ~ (i),Q.,k) 
Q , G are Pi-names.) 
in the 
Now player II plays as follows: in the n 
move he will define w n, 
pn,tn(i 
E wn) such that: 
1)p n c P.(.) 
, p <-Po, Pn <--Pn+l, 
2) 
w n 
is 
a 
finite 
subset 
of 
DomPn,W n C wn+ 1, 
and 
if 
Domp n = |in,~:k < ~] and w.l.o.g, in, o = 0 then w n = lim,~,m an,k 
<--n I, (so 
eventually [J w n = uDompn ) 
3) pn+ltw n = pn t w n 
4) 
For 
i E wn, 
let 
n(i) = Min ~m:i E ~m], 
and 
tr = <<r~,r >:n(i)<_m<_n <~> is such that F/m isa countable set of pc_ 
*~Tr, 
name of O -name of an ordinal < A and r 
a P~-name of an ordinal, and 
Pn t i I~-p, "' t~ is an initial segment of a play of PG~ (Pn(*) , (i),Q 
, A), in 
which player 1I uses the strategy G " 
~i 
5) In the zero move (as w 0 = ~b), player I chooses a Pa(.)-name of 
an ordinal ~0' and player 1I chooses Po ->P, P0 ]l-pa.) "~0 = r 
and play the 
ordinal r 
6) In the nth-move, let player I play the Pa(,)-name of an ordinal 
= ~un_ i. Player II ("on the side"), let wn_ I = je = j(g) (or really s 
< ~ and 
0 =j(O) <j(1) <''' 
<j(g,~); and define by downward induction on m ~gn, 
the countable set F~ (m) of Pj(m)+l-names of ordinals: 
a) 
for 
m = gn 
let 
Pn,m c P.(.), 
Dompn, m C je(n)+l, 
a(*)) 
pnt(je(n)+l,a(*))~--pn,m 
be such that for some countable set F~, m of 
Pj(m)+i-names of ordinals Pn,m ]]-P.l.~" ~+l e F~,m . 
b) for m < g(•) 
if p~(m+i) is defined, player II define t~'~ +i) according 

405 
to 
G 
and 
let 
Pn,ra c Pa(.),Dompn,m ~ (Jc~(m),Jcl(ra+l)). 
~j(m+l) 
Pn r(Jm,Jm+l)<Pn,m , be such that for some countable set F~ (m) of Py,,,+V

are actually ordinals) andpn+l = 
U Pn,ra U ~n-1 ~ wn). 
m'~tZa 
This is easily done and in the end, as for each i E U wn, player lI has 
simulated a play of PG~pn(o(i),Q i , h) in which the second player uses his 
winning 
strategy

(the 
union 
of

IPp,"qCi) 
It-~," U |Fra:n(i) ~- n < ~ ~- I~::m < ~] '" 
It is clear that q (i.e. Dom q = U wn , q(i) defined above) belong to 
Pa(*). We have to prove q I~-"~ c UF~,_I = ~~ 
< ~1 " 
n 
Letr_~q 
, r Ip"~ 
=~*". 
Note first that q -~pn for every n < ~. Now using alternatively the choice 
of Pn,m and the winning of the second player in PGo~n(Q,~Q ~ , ~) we can push 
down 
the 
minimal 
i <a(*) 
such 
that 
for 
some 
rt-~r 
, r ? I~-P,~ 
"~~ c l~i :m < ~1 ': so at last we get i = O, which is what we want. 
At first glance we get it too cheaply. 
But there is a delicate point - the choice of Pn,m; it is really not a condi- 
tion of Py(m+l) or Pa(*) but a Pi(m)+vname for it. The delicate point is that its 
domain is a name, whereas it is required to be a set. However, it is not fatal 
as long as at last q would be a real condition, for which it is not necessary to 
really know DomPn,m, just.to find a countable set including it. So into the 
list of names player II is manipulating he has to add names of the members of 

406 
Dompn,m. 
So it is enough to ask that Dompn,m C Fn j(m'n) i.e., there 
are 
pj(m,n)_name ~j(mm)(g < ~) such that 
I~-pj(~,~.l"Domp~,m = I~i("z'n):g < col 
~n,~

~-,s 
and we let vJ(m)6pnj(m,n)" 
But he can manipulate 
only names of ordinals 
<k; 
this 
is 
why 
]a(*)l =k 
was 
required 
so 
in 
the 
end 
we 
know 
Dompn,m C L) F~,-I, and there are no problems.

The cases i = O,a > ~ are proved by induction on et. 
For l~ = 2, we already know from what we prove that player II wins 
PG~(p ,P,(,);~,) for everyp c Pa(*) , and the proof is simple.

Amalgamating the S-condition with properness 
This section continues 
Chapter XI, trying the condition from it by a 
weaker one, so that it is satisfied by some forcing notions which add reals (in 
fact any proper one) and is satisfied by a forcing notion P if[ it is satisfied by 
the corresponding 
Boolean algebra. 
The amalgamation 
of ~Si]-semi proper- 
ness with the S-condition is delayed to [Sh 198?d] ; (the same is true for cov- 
ering models from VI, w 
However, up to now, the further was not needed. 
3.1 Definition: Let I be a set of monotone 
families and P a forcing 
notion. 
(1) We say that (T,I,~,~) is an (LP)-tree if 
(a) (T,I) is an I-tree (see Definition XI 2.4 (2).) 
(b) ~ is a function with domain T such that for every 77 E T, ~(~7) is a P- 
name of an ordinal <- ]P]. 
(c) ~ is a function from T such that each ~(~7) is an ordinal. 
2) We say that (LP)-tree (T,I,~,~) obeys a function F if there are 
fronts Jn c T for n < ~ (see Definition XI 2.5 (8)) such that every member of 
Jn+l has a strict initial segment in Jn and 77 c Jn implies

= 
F(n,w[n], (<~(nt~), ~(nt~)> ~ -" e (7))) 
where w[~7] is as in XI 2.6. 
3) We say that the forcing notion P satisfies UP0(1) if for every 
p c P there is a function Fp (with domain and range as implied implicitely in 
(2)) such that for any (LP)-tree (T,I,~,~) obeying Fp and Tt, 
(T,I) <~ (Tt,l)

S~ 
contradicting the common 
Abstract: We prove that e.g. S~ <S(2S0). 
assumption that for singular strong limit A, 
2 A have a bound only when A has 
uncountable cofinality. We prove a strengthening of the covering lemma, not 
using the fine structure theory (only some well known consequences, see 
Theorem 0.2 ). We prove it essentially in all cases in which the covering 
lemma holds. 
w Introduction 
Let us review the development of the singular cardinals problem, which is 
essentially "what can be 2 x (more exactly Act x ) when A is singular" and the 
covering lemma which appear first in this connection. 
By works of Prikry [P] and Silver [Si 1] it follows that A may be strong 
limit of cofinality S 0 , 2 x > A + (and by [Mg 4] any cofinality). 
In 1973 Magidor [Mg] proved that A = S~(i = S~,) may be strong limit, 
while 2 A > ~,+ (using supercompact cardinals). In 1974 Silver proved e.g., that 
S~, cannot be the first cardinal violating G.C.H., using a forcing argument, fol- 
lowing a similar theorem using a "large" filter on small cardinals (see [Si] ) of 
Magidor. This was a big surprise and an extensive, more or less simultaneous; 
work on the subject follows. Baumgartner and Prikry [BP] gave an elemen- 
tary proof of Silver's theorem. 
Galvin and Hajn~tl [GH] solve the question 
Silver left open: If S~I is strong limit they got a bound on its power set: In fact 
if cf ~ = Sl, (Ya < ~)S~' < S~ then (Sa)Sl < ~(l~lSl).. Jech and Prikry get similar 
results with sharper bounds (like (S~,)Sl < S~2) and for more cases (like the 
first ~ = S~ , cf ~ = ~l) but with an extra strong hypothesis: on Sl there is a 
precipitous ideal (which is an analog of being measurable.) 
Magidor [Mg 2] 

411 
got (bI~1) 
t~1 < I~2 from a weaker hypothesis: Chang conjecture. 
In all the above we can replace cf 6 = R I by "6 has uncountable eofinality 
" and it was felt that this is essential, and in fact a reason for its not being 
discovered earlier. 
At that time Jensen made a fundamental discovery: the covering lemma, 
he proved that if 0 # ~ V then for any set a c V of ordinals there is 
b cL 
, a Cb 
, V~"lb]<_ 
[a[ +~1", hence ~-----)~+ for )~>2 ~. 
So large 
cardinals of some kind are necessary for e.g. Magidor [Mg] results. This 
appears in Devlin and Jensen [De J]. 
Some time later, Dodd and Jensen [DJ] introduce the core model, (a gen- 
eralization of L related to measurables) and a similar covering lemma for it; 
hence show that for Magidor's [Mg] results a measurable is necessary. 
Mitchel [Mi] works in this direction on hyper-measurable cardnals. 
About the same time Magidor [Mg 1 ]-proved G.C.H. may hold below N o but 
not for N~ using a huge cardinal. By Silver's theorem this is not the case for 
R~I, so it strengthens the feeling there is a difference between the countable 
and uncountable cofinality cases; and though Magidor cannot make L ~" too 
high (N~+o+l for N o strong limit, ~+2 when G.C.H. holds below No) it seemed the 
reason may be the need for larger cardinals. 
In [Sh 1] we get a bound on 2 N~ if e.g., N$ is strong limit, 6 the first 6 = ~ 
of cofinality ~1, assuming Chang conjecture. 
We also improve Galvin and 
Hajnal's results in some cases, e.g., 161 = =~. The method continue, [GH], but 
we use the interplay of various filters i.e., proving statements for all filters. 
We get in ZFC a bound on 2 se for t~ strong limit (M~)Sl for e.g., the first 
6=Na , cf(6) =~i. 

412 
In [Sh 80b] we get bound on (t~6) t~' for e.g., the first ~ =t~ 
, cf (~)= t~ 1 
assuming Chang conjecture. 
In [Sh 1987a] we use Dodd and Jensen's results, 
even when & = t~$; e.g., if there is no (even weakly) inaccessible cardinal < t~, 
then there is no such cardinal -- 2t%; and if 8 is the first ~ = ~$ of cofinality B1, 
we get a bound for 2 t%. It seems we can show the thesis "if t~$ is reasonably 
small, then so is 2 t% " in all cases. However in our bounds (2t~t) + was replaced 
by (22t%)+; and Hajnal found that the proof of the thesis failed in the following 
case. 
Let 
C ~ 
the class of cardinals, 
C ~+1 =l~c 
C a'i/~E 
C a:/~<k] 
has 
order type k], and C ~ = C~ C~, and k the al-th cardinal in C ~ 
In [Sh 198?c] , Magidor [Mg ] is continued and his results were improved 
and an indication Hajnal problem may be serious. It was proved (using super- 
compact cardinals) that t~ may be strong limit while L ~~ = ~a+l , a any ordi- 
nal <~1, ( similarly for t~ol ) and the ~-th cardinal ~ in C ~ may be strong limit 
while 2 x be arbitrarily large below the first inaccessible cardinal. 
Forman and Woodin [FW] and Woodin [W] prove that G.C.H. may fail every- 
where and even L #a = t~a+ 2 using Radin forcing and Magidor work [Mg ]. 
However, we prove here ( in Section 5 ) that if t~ o is strong limit, then 
2 t% < t~(2t~0) § The basic idea is that: 
(*) if a C Bo is a good set (i.e., closed under some countably many func- 
tions, a f~ t~n+ 2 contains a closed unbounded subset of Sup (a N t~n+2) which 
has 
an 
uncountable 
cofinality), 
then 
a 
is determined 
by the 
function 
Ch a 
, Cha(~n) = Sup (a A t~n)- 
Our strategy is to build for any countable x Ct~, a good a Ct~ 
, x Ca 
such that the number of possible Ch a is small. 

413 
In fact we work harder in order to prove. 
0.1 Theorei~ If 6 is a limit ordinal of cofinality *; then l~ < ~(lal~).. 
(Note as a consequence that e.g., if ~ is the first 5 = ~ > 2 ~~ then 
(v a < 5).,, "~ < 
So for the results of [GH] uncountable cofinality is not needed. 
Unfortunately, it is still open whether this holds for the results of [Sh 
198?a] , e.g., whether we have no bound for 2 l~a , l~= strong limit, a the first 
In fact, the idea of reconstructing sets from their characteristic func- 
tions was first used in investigating the strong covering lernma. The neatest 
case of the strong covering lemma is 
0.2 TheoreNz Assuming 0#

IF), 
A c Ord v. 
If 
I~[= l~ L[A] M a model in V with countably many finitary functions whose set of 
elements is an ordinal a then for every b C a there is a set a C a, which 
belong LoL[A] and is closed under the functions of M , b Ca ca, and in V 
I 
l-<lbl. 
The theorem is really much more general, it speaks on a pair of universes 
Ir C V, and uses three hypothesises which are known to hold in the case 
above: the usual covering lemma, the existence of squares and the existence 
of scales (for successor of singular cardinals, see w for the definitions). Also 
the conclusion is stronger: for regular ~ < ~, < X*, (~ > ~0 for simplicity) and a 
player I has a winning strategy in the following game of length X: 
in the ith move, player I chooses a t C a ,

We can conclude that e.g., if 0 # g V, then any forcing nation sati~fies 
quite strong properr~ess condition. 
The problem arises as follows; Jensen and Solovay [JS] asked how adding a 
real can affect a universe. 
Now adding 0 # to L causes the collapsing of many cardinals, and they 
knew that adding some real by forcing may collapse many cardinals (later in 
Beller and Jensen [BJ] much more radical results of Jensen were proved: if 
0# g V and V satisfies G.C.H., then there is a generic extension of V (by a 
class forcing) which preserves cardinalities and has the form L[a]). Still L[a] 
always satisfies G.C.H. So it was natural to ask, which Jensen and Solovay [JS] 
does, later Jensen eliminates the use of 0# g V 
0.3 Problem: If If satisfy G.C.H. V = If[r] , r a real, V and If have the 
same cardinals, does V satisfies CH? 
There are also several other variants, e.g., 
0.4 Problem= 1) If If satisfies CH, V = If[r] ,r a real, t~=~then 
does 
V satisfy CH? 
J 
2) Ask in addition that V,W have the same cardinals 
< 2 t~~ 
and/or If satisfies G.C.H. 
Avraham [A] was interested in this problem, he proved that the conclu- 
sion of 0.2 implies a negative answer to the question 0.3, and the author 
proves 0.2 if a < t~. Harrington and Van Liere have similar results, parallely. 
Avraham [A] have conjectured 0.2 when V and L have the same cardinals. He 
also gave another application: 
If L[A] , L[B] have no non-constructible reals then L[A,B] have no non- 
constructible reals provided that I~ L[A's] =I~l v. 
Just recently Shelah and 
Woodin [SW] proved that adding a real to a universe V satisfying G.C.H. may 
blow up the continuum while not collapsing cardinals, starting with a model 

415 
V ? with enough measurable 
cardinals i.e., answering 0.3 negatively. [SW] has 
also several consistency results of weaker conditions using smaller large car- 
dinals (e.g., from the consistency of ZFC we can get V = If[v], with If satisfy- 
ing CH, I~= I~, and (L:~~ V arbitrarily large, i.e., 0.4). Here, using the strong 
covering lemma we get several complimentary results, so we know which large 
cardinals are necessary for which variant; for some variants we know exactly, 
and for some reasonable lower and upper bound. 
This is done in section 4, 
and one of the cases ( see 4.xx) involve proving somewhat more than the 
strong covering lemma. 
The cases in which we do not have exact results are: 
A) For the first result, (for 0.3) a measurable cardinal is necessary, but 
they use (2t%) v many; we need a suitable inner model so maybe Mitchel [Mi] 
work can close the case 
B) The existence of V = If[r] , I~l v = tI~ , If satisfies G.C.H., but in V, CH 
fails. We need an inaccessible, and a 2-Mahlo cardinal suffice. 
The obvious approach to the strong covering lemma seemed to be to redo 
the covering lemma more carefully; however this is not our solution. 
We 
rather prove by induction on a the statement described above.

Another question appears in Mathias [M] 
Question: Can V satisfy G.C.H., A C ~ 
, V[A] has the same cardinals as 
V, andin V[A] 2 tl~ >t~.,, t~v[ 
A] =tr 
Note that if we replace M~I by a regular cardinal, the answer is negative, 
and if we replace it by a singular cardinality of cofinality Ir 
such as ~, the 
answer is positive. By the strong covering lemma if 0 # g V, or even V has no 
inner model with measurable 
the answer is no. 
In fact even if 0# ~ L[A], 
V ~ "(Va < col)t~a 
~' < t~,", tq v = tqa vIA] for a = i, and arbitrarily large a < ~,, 
then V[A] ~ "' 2t%.ctr162 "'. It seemed very persuasive that using the inner 

416 
models for hyper-measurable (see Mitchel [Mi]) we can get stronger inner 
models for that question (and get the relevant exact equi-consistency result 
for the question of violating CH by adding a real mentioned above). 
w 1 The Strong Covering ]..emma: Definition and implications 
1.1 Context: Let V be a universe ( of set theory), Ir a transitive class of 
V which is a model of ZFC (with the same ordinals) so that W C V. Writing e.g., 
W 0 C W 1 we implicitely assume the corresponding hypothesis. 
1.2 Definition: The pair (W, V) satisfies the A-covering lelnma ( X a cardi- 
nal 
of 
V) 
if 
for 
every 
set 
a 9 V, 
a c W, 
V ~="]al <A" 
there 
is 
b c W , a ~b and V~"]bl 
<A". 
If we omit k this means "for every X-> t~'". W.l.o.g. a,b are sets of ordi- 
nals. 
1.3 Definition: The pair (;r V) satisfies the strong (A,a)-covering lemma 
(A regular cardinal of V,a an ordinal) if for every model M in V with universe 
a 
(always with 
countable 
many finitary functions 
and 
relations) 
and 
a ca 
, ]a] <A (in V), there is b 9 W ,a cb 
Ca, 
b an elementary submo- 
del of M ( i.e., the set of elements of such a submodel) and V ~ "]b ] < A': 
Instead saying for every a, we write ~ instead a, or write "the strong A- 
covering". 
Of course we can replace a by any set in W of the same power, so w.l.o.g, a is 
a cardinal of W; and assume M has Skolem functions so it is enough that b is 
a submodel. 
1.4 Definition: (1) The pair ( W, IO satisfies the strong (A*,A,~,a)-covering 
lemma 
(where ~ --< k --< A* are regular cardinals in V,a an ordinal) if player I wins the 
following game (in 
V, i.e., has a winning strategy) which we call "the 

417 
(X ,k,g,a)-covermg game 
The play last X moves, in the ith move , player I chooses a t c V, a subset 
of a of power < X* (in V), which include ubj, 
and player II chooses b t, a sub- 
j<i 
set of a of power < A* which include (J aj.

Player I wins if there is a closed unbounded 
subset C C k, such that for

We omit a if we mean "for every a". 
(2) LetD be afilteron

i.e., onk+

as before. 
The pair (W,V) satisfies the strong (k~ 
lemma if player I wins 
in the following game (i.e., I has a winning strategy in V) which we call "the 
(k*,h,D,u)-covering game": 
The play last A moves; in the i-th move player I chooses a t 9 V a subset of a 
of power A" (in If) which includes U bj and then player II chooses b t a subset

which 
include

Player

Remark: The two popular cases are D = ~A c X+I : k e A! (then we get 
the (A*,A,A,a)-covering game) and D = IA c A + 1: there 
is a c.l.u.b. C C A 
such that ~6 9 C : cf 6 = ~] C A| (then we get the (A*,A,~,a)-covering game). 
1.5 Claim: 1) The strong (A*,h,~,a)-covering lemma implies the strong 
(A*,a)-covering lemma when A* > k or A > ~. 
2) The strong 
(X*,A,r 
lemma 
implies the strong 
(A*,X,~,al)-covering lemma when a 0 -> a 1. 
3) If Ir c I4 rt c Vt C V are universes of set theory with the same 
ordinals then: 
a) The strong (A,a)-covering for (It, V) implies the strong (),,a)-covering 

418 
lemma for ( W t, vt). 
b) The strong (A',~,~,a)-covering lemma for (W,V) implies the strong 
(A*,A,~,a)-covering lemma for (Wt, V). 
4) In the (A*,A,~,a)-covering game, it does not hurt any player to 
choose bigger sets as long as they are subsets of a of power < A* (i.e., if he 
has a winning strategy, increasing the sets he still wins). 
5) If k z <-- ~2 -- k3 , and ( W, V) satisfies the [strong] (kl,X)-covering 
lemma for every A < A2 , and also the [strong] (k2,A3)-covering lemma then 
(W, If) satisfies the [strong] (kl,Aa)-covering lemma. 
6) If (W1,W2) satisfies the [strong] (Xl,k)-covering lemma, and 
(W2, Wa) satisfies the [strong] (kl,k3)-covering lemma, then (W1,W3) satisfies 
the [strong] (kl,ka)-covering lem_rna. (Where W I C W e C W 3 , k z -- kS). 
Proof: Left to the reader. 
Remark: Why in 1.5 (3) (b) we speak on (~, V) and not (W ?, V?)? The win- 
ning strategy may be missing from In. 
1.6 Definition: We say W has square if for any cardinal/~ there are sets 
Ca(6 < ~ , ~ singular limit) such that: 
1) C a is a closed unbounded subset of 6 of order type < 6. 
2) if 7 is a limit point of C~ (i.e., Sup (C a AT)=7) 
then 
7.

then we can find < C a : 6 e S<~x> such that 
I) C a is a closed unbounded subset of 6 of order type < A. 
2) if 7 is a limit point of C a then C a (~ 7 = C T 
1.8 Definition: If the conclusion of 1.7 holds, (for every ~) we say W has 

419 
A-squares, and if this holds for every ;k ---> ~2, we say If has squares. 
1.9 Claim: 1) If the pair (If, V) satisfies the k-covering lemma, (A a cardi- 
nal in V) then for every limit ordinal 6 : if its cofinality in If is ~ X then its 
cofinality in V is -> k (the inverse is trivial). 
2) If If has A-squares, If C Iqt , (If, Ift) satisfies the A-covering 
lemma, then I4 rt has A-squares. 
1.10 Definition: We say that the universe If has scales if for every singu- 
lar cardinal X, there is a set G of X + functions, with domain R = lO : z~ < X reg-

t. t 1 Claim= Let (If, I z) satisfy the covering lemma. 
1) If If has A-squares, A -> t~aVregular in V, then V has A-squares. 
2) If If has a X+-scale, X a cardinal in V (hence X is singular in If, 
and X + in If's sense is the successor of X also in V) then Y 
has X+-scale. 
3) If If has squares then V has squares. 
4) If If has scales then V has scales. 
][lemark: The aim of 1.11 is that we will be able to get a strong covering 
lemma, e.g. for (W, 1O where 0 # ~ V, and not just for (L, V).

w Proof of Strong Covering lemmas 
Our aim is, essentialy to prove that strong covering lernmas hold when the 
covering lemma holds. We can get more from the proofs, We prove trivial 
cases of the strong covering lemma (2.1) and two inductive lemmas, aim at 
enabling us to prove the strong covering by induction on cardinals of W. The 
first (2.2) saying that we can advance from/z to/z +, and the second (which is 
the main proof) saying that we can advance to a limit cardinal/z (really the 
proof split to eases by cf v~z, so in some cases we get a little more). 
2.1 Lemma: 1) Suppose X is a regular cardinal in V , (W, I D satisfies the 
strong (Adz)-eovering lernrna for every/z < X , //> A. Then (W, V) satisfies the 
strong (A,X)-covering lemma. 
2) If ~k 
< A* are regular cardinals in V, then (W,V) satisfies 
the strong (A*,A,~,A*)-covering lemma. 
Proof: 1) If h =X , M a model with universe X and countably many 
functions, as then in V, for some a < X, a is closed under the functions of M, 
so it exemplifies the conclusion of the strong covering lemma. 
If k > X the strong (k,x)-eovering lemma is trivial. 
If k < X we can deduce the desired conclusion by 1.5(5) and the case A = X 
above 
2) The proof is similar. 
2.2 Lemma: Suppose: 
(1) (W,V) has the h*-covering lemma and W has the ),'-squares. 

421 
(2) (W, V) satisfies the strong (k~ 
lernma, and 
(3) ~ = ~I 0 or ~ = k implies k < k',k uncountable (in V).

Remark: Remember ~,* -> ~, k ~ are regular cardinals in V, and w.l.o.g. 
~>- k ~ (by 2.1(2), 1.5(2)). 
Proof: Before really proving 2.3, we shall give two facts, which are trivial 
but basic for our proofs and an observation.

Fact: 
In 
If 
for 
each 
ordinal

is 
a 
model

o 
,H~,O),F~ is a two place function from a, to a, such 
that for every tff < a 
, Fa ~ (fl,-) is a one to one mapping from fl onto Ifl] ~ (its 
cardinality in If); Ga~ 
-) is its inverse (on Ifllw), S ~ is the successor func- 
tion, CFOa is a one place function giving the cofinality for limit ordinals, and 
predeccessors 
for successor ordinals; H ~ a two place function, such that for 
lff limit <H ~ (fl,i): i < CF~ (fl)> is an increasing continuous sequence converg- 
ing to lff; 0 is an individual constant denoting 0, i.e., a zero-place function; for 
,e sueeessor, 
H2(,e,O) 
= I~1 
, H~ 
= I,el + 
Notation: We say a C a is a submodel of Mae if it is closed under the 
functions of M~ and cl (a,M~ 
is the closure of a C~ a under the functions of 
M ~ ; similarly for M~ which is defined below. 
2.2B Fact: If W has k*-squares, (remember, ~* is a regular cardinal in 
V) then there is Ma 1 = (M ~ ,C 1) , C 1 a two place function, such that: 
there is (in W) a sequence ( C~ ~ 
< ~ , ef ~ < ~') 
as in Claim 1.7, such 
that 
Cl(fl,fl) is the order type of C~ (if defined) 
Cl(fl,i) is the ith element of CI[ (if it exists). 

422 
c~(~+~,c~(~,~)) =

Notation: We usually omit the subscript a in the above functions. 
~..~.C Observation: If/~ is a cardinal of If , ~+ its successor in If, a ~ ~+ 
a 
sub 
model 
of 
M~ 
and, 
b C a 
is 
unbounded 
in

Proof: 1) As a N/~ca

For the other inclusion assume ~" 9 a, hence there is ~ c b , ~" ~ ~; if ~" =

2) Easy. 
Continuation of the Proof of 2.2. By the hypothesis, player I has a win- 
ning strategy in the (~',~,g,/~)-covering game, which we denote by /Q(i < A); 
i.e., if b i Ct~ for i <)t, 
IbillT<)~ ", then a t =/~(b0,b 1 ..... 
b1 "" ")j<i is a 
subset of/~ofcardinality

v(8)=g 
implies 
Uaj c W I contains a closed unbounded 
subset of ~, if g < A, and 
B) uajc 
Ifif~=~. 
Let us describe the winning strategy of player I in the (k ,h,~,/~ )-covenng 
game. 
In the ~'th move, aj C bj C a~(j < i < r are given, player I let,

and he 
Let us show that this strategy is a winning one, so let (a/,b~ : i < h> be a 
play in which player I uses the strategy described above; Clearly by the choice 
of the Kt's , there is a closed unbounded CoX 
such that if ~'c C U IM, 
cf(=~ 
then ag (3/z= Ubi (3/~c If. Let ~(i) =Sup(a/~ 
First assume 
> ~0- For any such (, clearly ag is a submodel of M~§ ~" is a limit ordinal, 
hence by Observation 2.2C, part 2 in order to prove agc 
If it is enough to 
find an unbounded subset b C ag as there i.e., b c If; our b here will be C~(r 
from Fact 2.2(B). Hence it suffices to prove that C~(r is a subset of ag. Now 
clearly <6(i): i < (> is an increasing continuous sequence converging to 
8((), so as C~(r is a closed unbounded subset of 5(~) , C~(r (3 I~(i) : i < ~l 
is a closed unbounded subset of ~(~). But 6(i) c a/+l C b~+t C ag (for i < ~).

Hence for a closed unbounded set of i < (, 
6(i) c C$(~) (3 ag. But ag is a 
submodel of M~., and ag (3 X" is an initial segment of h" (see definition of 
a/e). So by the definition of M~., for a closed unbounded set limit of i < (, 
Cl(~(i),~(i)) belongs to ag, hence (see (ii) above, and Ml's definition) 17:7 
the order type of C~(~)| C ag, hence (using Cl(~(i), 7)) 
C~(~) C ag , and of 
course ~(i) e C~(t). By the definition of squares C~(r 
C ag, so as mentioned 
above, this suffices. 
If ~ = 110, by assumption (3), k </t*, hence C~(x) is well defined (where 
•(A) = uS(i))- Hence for a closed unbounded set of (< h, 
8(~) e C~(x), and 
so for a closed unbounded set C of ( </t the following holds: 
a) ~({') is a limit point of C~(x), hence C~(r = C~(x) (-I ~(~') 
b) r is a limit of ordinals satisfying a).

and (W,V) 
satisfies the h-covering lemma and If has h-squares. 
Then ( W, V) satisfies the strong (A*,A,D,/~+)-eovering lemma (/~+ in W's since). 
We work for a while in W, present some definitions and facts, and only 
later return to the lemma. 
2.3A Notation: We let R denote the class of regular cardianls of W, 
R(#~,~) 
= Ix E R : ~, < x < ~l. 
Let T be (the class of) functions 3', with domain a subset of R , 3' (X) < X. 
We have two partial orders on T: 
1) 3" <g if Dom3" cDomg 
and 3' (X) < g (x) for xcDom3' 
(simi- 
larly 3' ~ g)

, Domd' has no last element, and 
for some X0 c Domf, and for every X -> X0 , X c Domf ~ 
f (X) < g(x) ( < ~ is 
transitive on each TI (see below )). 
If IKR 
is a set with no last element, T l= T(I)= 
If c T:Domjf ~I, 
Sup Dora f = Sup I] and T(t~I,t~) = T(R(I~I,I~)).

2.3D Definition: 1) For every a we can define a model Ma 2 c 1r an expan- 
sion of Ma 1 by the function F 2 = F= 2 and if (If, V) satisfies the h-covering 
lemma also C= 2 where: 
for each singular cardinal ~ of If, such that z~ + <- a, let f~,~(i < z~ +) be as in 
Fact 2.3C (for I = R f1 ~, and the ~*-squares we use in the definition of M~), 
and 

426 
2) Ca 2 is like Ca 1 , but using ~-squares < Cfi: cf vi < ~> 
2.3E Fact: Let /z be singular cardinal of W, we let M s = M~+, etc. 
Sup- 
pose a cM s is an elementary submodel in V, 
/~9

is unbounded, 
X0 </z, and for every X e R (~ a ~ (X0,/z),

Then, i) a = cl([a f~ X0] U A,M s)

9 W. 
Proof: 1) Let b = cl([a C~ X0] U A,MS), so clearly b c a; suppose b # a 
and eventually we shall get a contradiction. 
Let r be the first element in a-b 
and 6 the first element in b-~; so there is no member of b in the interval 
[r 
Case I: Let ~ be a successor ordinal. 
Then as Sob 
also ~--1 9 
(as CF ~ is one of the function even of /do., 
CF~ 
= 6-1, see Fact 2.2A), but r < ~-1 < 6, contradiction. 
Case ll: Let 6 be a limit ordinal, singular in W (i.e., either in W, 
]61 < 6, 
or ~ is a singular cardinal). 
Then as CF~ 
<6 
, and ~cb 
~ 
C_~o(~) cb, 
clearly CF~

Now 
M s ~ "(:~x)(x < OF~

r

~/e r a b "(~=)(= < cF~

So let a 9 
be such that a< 
CF~

As CF~

above) 
a<(;

As 
a E b , H~ 
c b, but ~" < H~

Case Ill: Let 6 be a regular cardinal in W. 

427 
Then 
~ > X0 
as 
~" > X0, 
as 
a f-I X0 c b. 
Sup (a f% ~) < S~.~ (je~,,($)) = S~_~ (Fa(/2,i,X)) -- Sup (b CI ~). 
So 
The last inequality holds 
as /~cA, 
(~b

Contradiction. 
Proof of Lemma 2.3: By the hypothesis of the Lemma, for a </~, player I 
has a winning strategy in the (A*,A,D,a)-covering game,which we denote by 
K~a(i < h), 
i.e., 
it

Let us describe a winning strategy of player I in the (X*,A,D,/~+)-covering

In the ~'th move , aj c bj C a~ C bt (j < i < {') are given, player I let:

Remark. 
If we want to get the result for ~ =R 0 < X < X* (i.e., for 
X=R 1,x 
=t~ e when 0 # ~ V) we can drop from the hypothesis on X (i.e., X- 
covering and h-squares) and add that the X+-squared scales (defined below) 
exists for If. 
Unfortunately it is not clear when, if ever, they exist. 
Definition: If has A ~ squared scales, if there are for each singular ~, a 
scale (f~" 
i < ~+>, and a X'-squares (C~ 'e" 6 <*+, cf ~ < X*>, and a X ~ 
square C~ (Oacardinalin 
If, ~>X*>cfz~) 
such that:

Remark: There maybe a forthcoming paper on squared scales by I,. 
Stanley and the author. 
2.4 Theorem : Suppose (V, If) is a pair of universes of set theory, 
R0 < ac < X < R* are regular cardinals in V, 
If have X'-squares and scales. 
Then (V, If) satisfies the strong (X*,X,~,~)-covering lemma, if it satisfies 
the X*-covering lemma and the h-covering lemma. 
2.5 Conclusion: If in V, 0 $ does not exist, then (L,V) satisfies the 
strong (~ff,~L~v~)-covering lemma. 
2.6 Theorem: Suppose (W,V) satisfies the X*-covering lemma, If has 
square and has scales. If there is no cardinallzof 
If, 
X</z<X*, 
~<X<~" 
are regular cardinals of V then (if, V) has the (X*,X,~,~)-strong covering pro- 
perty. 
Proof: Note that if V ~cfa=X 
then If ~"X-<cfa 
<(X+) v'', hence in 
our case If ~ "cf a = X". So we can strengthen a little the Claim 1.7 demand- 
ing: if cf ~ = X then C~ has order-type ~,. Now repeat the proofs of 2.2, 2.3. 
2.7 Conclusion: If 0 # t~ L, and there is no cardinal /z of L for which 
~v< ~ < ~v then (L,V) satisfies the strong ~2-covering lemma and the strong 

Bl-covering lemma.

w A Counterexample 
The following theorem says that even if V and L have the same cardinals, 
except t~, the strong ~ 1-covering lemma may fail. 
3.1 Theorem= Assume V satisfies CH, then there is a forcing notion R, of 
power t~ 2, which does not collapse t~ 1 (and even satisfies the condition from XI 
)and does not collapse-any ~= > t~ 2, such that (V,V R) does not satisfy the 
strong (t~l,~2V)-covering lelnma (so if V satisfies G.C.H., W satisfies GCH too ). 
Proof: Let P be e.g., the forcing of adding a Cohen real. In V p we define 
a forcing notion Q: 
Q = If : f is a function , with domain an ordinal 
a <t~ 1, and range included in 
-----a , Rang (f t ~) f~ V~ 
Q is ordered by inclusion. 
t~ 2, and for every limit 
First note that Q # ~b (as the empty function belongs to Q) and for every 
f c Q and~<t~ lthereisp 
c Q,p ~q 
, flcDomq. 
ForletDomp 
=a,and 
choose i < Sup Rang (p) (and i < t~2) and choose A C [i,i+fl+~) such that for 
every limit ~ if i < ~ <-- i + ~ + ~, then, A f~ [~,6+~) g V, and A has order type 
fl+r 
(easy as P add reals ). Now define q :Domq =a+fl , q(j) =p(j) for 
j < a, and q(a+j) is the j'th element of A. 
We work for a while in V P. 
As V P satisfies ~0 =t~ 1 , clearly Q has power ~2 and it is easy to check 
P * Q has power ~2, and it will be our R. It suffices to prove that Q does not 
collapse ~1, as the generic function from ~1 to ~2 will be the evidence of the 
failure of the strong (Ml,t~-covering lemma.

So let h be a Q-name (in VP), and p 9 Q force that it is a function from co 
onto sl- We define by induction on n < co for every 7/9 ~(c02) (i.e., a sequence 
of ordinals

moreover 
if 
g (7/) = m +1, 
then 
PT(Sup Pntm) = n(m) 
there are no problems in the definition. 
By Rubin and Shelah [RS] (the theorem 
on A-systems) there is T C ~>(~2) 
such that: 
a) <> c T and for every 7/ 9 T the number of 77 ^ <a> 9 T is 112 
6) D~ 
= ~(T) < c~ (i.e., Dompn 
depends on the length of ~/only) 
7) 
there 
are 
countable 
sets 
a n c ~a, 
Rang pn C a T 
such 
that 
if 
7/t s = v t s jq(Ig) # v(s 
then a T CIav = aTrr 
Let a T = Sup ar~, so w.l.o.g. 
(*) if a <fl

(aT^<# > =aT) > a 
Let C = |{'<112 : for 7/9 (o>{-) A T , a T ~ ~,and 
~a : ~ ^ <a> 9 Ti is unbounded in r 
Clearly it is a closed unbounded 
subset of 112, hence 
it contains a closed 
unbounded 
subset Ct which belongs to V. Hence there is <{'n : ~ < ~o> 9 V 
increasing and included in C ,<{-n :n <m> 
e Tform 
<c0. 
Now let a = In(s163 
<~l ~ V , ~(~) <~z(s 
We define by induction 
on g, an ordinal as such that 

437 
1) ~'n(n) < an < ~n(s 
This is easy by(*) above. Letp ~

Nowp*

if 
b = Rang p ~ c V, 
then 
a =[s :(r162 
I~b ~0] e V as (r163 
<~> 
e V, contradiction. 
Hence 
b g V, and it is easy to check p * c Q, and clearly p * determine h, so we finish. 
To prove that Q does not collapse ~1 , hence we find the proof of 3). 
Note Q does not add reals, hence V R satisfies CH. 
w When adding a real cannot destroy CH 
On core models see Dodd and Jensen [DJ] " they prove 
4.1 Theorem= For every model (of set theory) V there is a core model 
K(V) ~ V, such that 
(1) K(V) is a transitive class containing all ordinals, and W C V 
implies K(W) C K(V). 
(2) K(V) satisfies G.C.H., (hence has scales) has squares ; let 
K~(V) be the family of sets in K(V) of hereditary power <~. 
(3) If in V there is no inner model with a measurable cardinal, 
then (K(V), V) satisfies the covering lemma. 
(4) K(V) has a definable well ordring (hence definable Skolem 
functions). 
The following is known: 
4.2 Theorem- 1) Suppose W C V have the same cardinals, then they 
have the same core model. 

438 
(2) Moreover if If ~ V have the same cardinals -< A, where A is a 
limit cardinal (in both) then Kx(V ) = Kx(W) (see 4.l(2)). 
Proof: 1) Suppose K( W) # K( V), so let A ~a 
, A cK(V), 
A ~K(If). So 
there is a mice of K(V) to which A belongs, hence there is such a mice of 
K(1O-power ]a I; but we can extend it, hence for every limit cardinal k > a of 
V there is a mice with critical point A, to which A belongs, and the filter is 
generated by end segments of IX:X < A , X a cardinal in V]. But then this 
mice is in If hence in K(If). 
2) The same proof. 
4.3 Conclusion: Suppose in V there is no innner model with a measur- 
able cardinal. Then 
(1) V have scales and squares. 
(2) If If C V have the same cardinals then (W,V) satisfies the 
strong A-covering lemma for every cardinal k -> l~ 1 of V. 
(3) If If C V have the same cardinals -< ~ or even K~(if) = K~(V), 
where /~ is a limit cardinal (of V) then (If, V) satisfies the strong (X,~)- 
covering lemma for any cardinal k of V CA > ~to) 
Proof: 
(1) By hypothesis (K(V),V) satisfies the A-covering lemma for 
every A-> l~[ (cardinal in V), by fine structure theory K(V) has squares and 
scales. So our main theorem 2.6 give the desired conclusion. 
(2) K(V) = K(if) by the previous theorem, hence K(V) c If. By 
(1) (K(V),V) satisfies the strong A-covering lemma for k >-l~a cardinal of V 
as K(V) c W we finish by 1.5 (3) (b). 
(3) Similar proof. 
4.4 Theorem: (Magidor). If W c V , K(lf) r K(V) then for some cardinal 
Aof K(V) andA ~A , A oK(if), 
Kx(if) =Kx(V) but there is a class C(in V) 

439 
of ordinals in K(If), such that in K(W) , C is indiscernible over A, and K(W) 
is the Skolem hull (see 4.1 (4)) of A kJ C. 
4.5 Theorem= If V= W[r], and (if, V) satisfies the strong ~,-covering 
lemma (A a cardinal of Y) then ~ (2~) v = ] ~2 (2~)wI v and (X<X) v = I(X<X)w] v 
~<~ 
t~<x 
for every X. (for this the strong (~,,a)-covering lemma for a < (/~+) v. 
Proof: Easy. 
4.6 Conclusion: If V has no inner model with a measurable cardinal, 
V= If[r], 
If, V have the same cardinals 
~, 
were k=(2t%)v~I~ 
and 
If 
satisfies CH, but 
V does not, then Kx(if) = Kx(V) , K(If) # K(V) (this is 
stronger than 0 # c V). 
Proof: We know that Kx(W) = Kx(V ) by 4.2(2). 
On the other hand if 
K(W) = K(V) then by 4.3(3) the pair (If, V) satisfies the strong k-covering 
lemma. So by Theorem 4.5 (below) (2t%)v=(2~~ ~, contradiction 
to "If 
satisfies CH but V does not. 
4.7 Conclusion: If V= W[r] ,r 
a real , W satisfies G.C.H and in 
V ,2 R~ >~2 
~hen 
0 # c V. 
Proof: Suppose 0# ~ V. By 2.5 (W,V) satisfies the strong t4~-covering 
lemma, hence by 4.5 in V L#~ 
If 2 ~~ 
3 in V we should use a finer 
theorem, 4.13 below. 
4.8 Conclusion: 
If V= W[r] , V and 
W have the 
same cardinals 
_ (L#o) v 
W satisfies CH but V does not then 0 $ c V. 
Proof: Use 2.7 and 4.5. 

440 
4.9 Lemma: Suppose If c V , k a cardinal of If, and 
a) 1) ~ E If is a regular in If, or 
2) If the square principle for X holds in W i.e., there are C~ C 
for 
~ 
limit 
< ~,+ , C~ 
closed 
unbounded 
and 
for 
7 =Sup (7 N C~) ~ 
C 7=7 
N C~) 
b) V I ='' c[ vX # cf F(IXl v) ,, 
Then in V the If-successor of h is not a cardinal. 
Proof: By hypothesis a) in W we can easily find < A~: i </~+> such that: 
A~ cN , A~ has order type h, and for every i <k + there is a function 
~fi : i -~/~, such that the sets Aj -jet(j) (j < i) are pairwise disjoint. (If ~ reg- 
ular : trivially, if not: by Litman [Li] , using Jensen's theorem on gap one 
transfer theorem (see Ben David [BD] , or directly)). 
Suppose h + (in If's sense) is a cardinal of V. 
Let us work in V. Let 
X = cf I hl 
, cf A =/z. 
So 
k = U Ba , B= 
increasing 
continuous 
with 
=<x 
a 
, IBal < ]~]. Now each A~, as an ordered subset of A, has cofinality/~, (as 
A~ has order type ~) and by assumption (b),/~ # X- Hence for each i for some 
a(i) < X , Ai i~/1=(~) is an unbounded 
subset of A~ (if X </~, trivially, and if 
X >/z remember B a is increasing). We are assuming that (in V) the number of 
At's isA + , IA +] > IXl,henceforsomea, 
C=~i 
:a(i) =a] has power > IA]. 
Leti be theA-thmemberof 
C; so I[Ai-fi(j)] 
(3 B= : J < i 
, j 9 C] is a fam- 
ily of I AI pairwise disjoint subsets of B a, each non empty, contradiction to 
IB=I < Ixl. 
4.10 Theorem= Suppose W f: V = If[r] , r a real and 
a) In V the continuum hypothesis fails 
b) In W G.C.H. holds 
c) If has squares. 
d) ( If, V) satisfies the strong Sa-covering lernma. 
Then in W there is an inaccessible cardinal, in fact t~ 2 is inaccessible in If. 

441 
Proof: Let x=(2t%) v , X=I~I v. W.l.o.g. x-(t~2) V hence by (a) ~=S2 v, 
hence ~ is a regular cardinal in V hence in If. If the conclusion of the 
theorem fails, ~ is a successor cardinal in If, so let it be ~ = A+. So by the 
previous lelnma cf vh= cf v(IX]/). 
However ]hi v is necessarily t~V=x (as 
t~lv--- k < t~a v) hence cf vA = t~ 1. 
Let C :<C~:i <~> 9 If be alist of allbounded subsets of J;in If. By4.5, 
every real s of V is in La[C,r ] for some a < m (so really we can replace If by 
L[C]). Let in V, A = uAi , IA~ I y < X, Ai(i < X) increasing continuous. Let s 
~<x 
be a real of V, then s 9 La(s)[C,r] for some a(s) < g, w.l.o.g, a(s) -> A. Let 
fa(s) 9 If be a one-to-one function from a(s) onto A. Still working in V , 
L,(s)[C,r] = u N~ , N~(7 <X) an increasing continuous sequence of count- 
7<x 
able elementary submodels of La(s)[C,r ], closed under fa(,), 
f,;~). 
So 
<A,:i 
<X> and <N~ AA:T<X> 
are sequences (in V) of countable sets 
increasing, continuous with the same union : A and of length X = sv 
Clearly 
for some7(s) 
, l~7(s) N A = AT(s), and let ~7 = Sup A T<A. 
Now in V the continuum hypothesis fails, hence there is a list of g distinct 
reals, |sr 
< g], and we can replace it by any subfamily of power g. So 
w.l.o.g. 7(s~) =7 for every~'<~and 
for eacha<~,letA 
abe the closure of 
/~7 by fa,f[, 1 so A a 9 W. Now in If the number of possible isomophism types 
of M a=(Aa,fa,fg 
t,<,''i 9 C~,~T) is ~21671-A ( as If satisfies G.C.H.) So 
w.l.o.g, this isomorphism type is the same for every a(s~)(~ < g), hence all/~7 r 
are isomorphic (in 1I) (As any isomorphism from Ma(s, ) onto Ma(s2 ) is the iden- 
tity on A 7, hence take A~71 NA=A 7 onto A~Tz AA=AT; 
hence it takes 
~' (~ K; onto A~7~ r~- and preserve the relation "i 9 Cj '9. But ]~7 r is count- 
able, and we have too many reals, contradiction. 
4.11 Conclusion: If there are universes W c V = W[r] , r 
a real, If 
satisfies G.C.H., and in V C.H. fail then in L there is an inaccessible cardinal. 
Proof: Suppose in L there is no inaccessible cardinal. Then If has 

442 
squares and scales. (W, If) satisfies the strong t~2-covering lelnma, then all the 
hypothesis of 4.10 are satisfied, hence its conclusion, which is the conclusion 
of 4.11. But by w we do not know that the strong t~2-covering lemma holds. 
However by 4.15 below, we know that for every for every real s 9 V, for some 
countable N~ (in V) (i <X, 
N=(N 
n w)[r], 
N~ (~ A=Aa, for some a t <~1, 
uN~ n ~: is an ordinal, and each N~ is easily reconstructible from N~ f~ 
*<x 
(see 4.15 for exact meaning). The rest is as before. 
Remark: So why 4.10, 4.11 comes before 4.15? We think the proof of 
4.10 makes the understanding of 4.12-4.15 easier (using the notation of the 
proof of 4.10.

The main result of this section is: 
5.1 Theorem= For a limit ordinal 6 (tq~) cf~ 
< 
t4(1~10~6). 
Moreoverif~=a+fl 
, ~0then(t~) 
cr6 < 
tCa+(l~10~s). 
The proof is broken into a series of claims and lemmas. 
5.2 Remark: If ~ = t~ the theorem says nothing. 
5.3 Remark: If 2 cf ~ > N~ the theorem is trivial, (2 cf ~ = t~$ is impossible) 
so w.l.o.g. 2 cf ~ < N~; let N= = Min lh : ~cf ~ _~ tr 
then by trivial cardinal arith- 
metic 
(t~a)cf $=(tq$) cf~, 
and 
cfa~cfS, 
and 
/g<a==~t~ 
~ ~<t~=, 
hence 
t~a of= =tr f~, 
So 
the 
theorem 
for 
a 
implies 
it 
for 
5; 
so 
w.l.o.g. 
a < 6 -----------> t~ cf ~ < tq~. However, we shall use only 
Hypothesis: Let = = cf 5, we shall assume that 2 x < t~$. 
5.4 Claim= If D is an ultrafilter on a set A, then 
1) In aA/D (considering a as an ordered set) every increasing 
sequence of length 7, such that cfy > 2 IA I has at least upper bound. 
2) If (f/D) c aA/D is the least upper bound of an increasing 
sequence of length )k , Xa = cf [f (a)] for a c A then ax4x=/D has cf ~. 
Proof: See [Sh 1987a ] or [Sh 80b ].

5.8 Lemma:

there 
is

(i.e., 
Ix e A : .f (x) =" g(x)] e ln)

Proof: 1) For every/? ~ A we shall define a function fB E T B. If /? ~ Ix,, 
then If r B : f 
E FJ is not a cover of T B, hence there is fB E T B, such that for 
no f 
cF 
is fB <fmodI

[ Suppose 
there 
is no 
such 
fB; 
for every 
C~/? 
, CcI x 
let 
2~c 
be 
a 
cover

for 
some

g c T c , f ~ C < g. So f < h r (B-C) L) g, hence F ~ is a cover, contradicting 
Be&.] 
If B c Ix let fs c Ts be arbitrary. 
Now define g c TA: 
forxE-A 
,g(x) =Sup~fB(X)+I 
:BCA 
, xcB]. 
As [xcA 
~X>2~,xregular],clearlyg(x)

that g is as required. 
If not, for some f 
oF, ~xcA

call

set

Now 
as

we 
know 
that

so 
B? = IX e 17 : f B(X) > f (X)] r Ix, 
but 
for 
X E B?, fs(x) ~- f (X) ~- g (X) >- fB(X) + 1, contradiction, 
as B? g I x ==~ B? # ~. 
2) Suppose h is singular 
> 2 ~, and A c I x but A ~ I n for all/~ < k. 
So T A has a cover F of cardinality h, and let F = Ifi : i < h]. As h is singular 
let A= 
U 
~,cfh<k 
0 and 2 ~<~ 
<h. 
For each i <cfA 
by 5.8 (1) ( as 
~<cf A 
A g/x~) there 
is g~ c T a, such that fa <gim~ 
for a<2q. 
As cfh<k, 
A gIx~ hence 
by 5.8(1) 
there 
is g c T a 
, g~ <gmodIxo 
for i <cf~,. 
So 
a<~ 
, i<cfA 
fa<gi 
<gmodI<x 
g is a counterexample 
to the assertion "F is a cover of 
As f a,g~,g ~- TA, 
TA". 
3) The "if" part 
For B~A 
,BcI 
xlet F B be a cover of T B, of cardinality 
~,. 
Let Fbe 
the closure of |f~ :i < A +] U IJ IFB : B C A , B c Ix] under the operation: 
f 
+ 1 :(f +I)(x) = f (X) § i 
Max If ,g J : Max If ,g ] (X) = Max If (x),g (X) I, 
so 
Dora[Max lf,gl] = (Dora f) tJ (Doing). 
Now clearly I FI -< A+ , F 
a cover of T A. (Alternatively we could define F as 
in the proof of 5.8 (1)). 
The "only if' part 

447 
So assume A ~IA. , A ~I n , TA has a cover ig, :i<X+f. 
We can define 
by induction on a < X § , f= c TA such that: 
fori < a , gr < f amod I~, and f r < famod In 
The induction step is by 5.8 (1) (as A g In), and Ira : a < ~,+] are as required. 
4) The proof is similar to 3).

In particular, if W c I.

ally X. 
Proof: Easy by 5.8(3), 5.8(4). 
Remark: If la E W:X~ =X] c D then the cofinality of axeg~a/D is trivi- 
S.lO Lemma: 1) If X > e ~ , I n # I. then I x # In. 
2) If A > 2 ~ is regular, I<x # I| then I<x # I x. 
Proof: 1) As I~, # I| 
let A ~: I.~ - I x, and by 5.8(1) and (5.4(1) we can find 
f, E TA(i < A+) such that f, < fjmod I~ for i < j. Let D be an ultrafilter on A 
to which A-B belongs for every B c I x. 
So in (B~)A/D there is an increasing sequence of length A +, i.e., f,/D 
. 
By claim 5.4(2), there are regular cardinals Xa c (2",~), such that a~Axa/D 
has cofinality A+. Hence by claim 5,9 necessarily I n # I~,.. 
2) A similar proof.

M ~6 is defined as in Fact 2.2A. 
5.13 Definition: 1) For a set a C t~ let Ch a ( the characteristic 
function 
of a ) be defined as Ch.a(X) = Sup (a n x) for x c (2~,l~a) regular, which belong 
to a. 
2) We call a C I~,~ i ~- good if /~--> 2 ~, a is a submodel of M ~ and

5.14 Claim: If a,b cI~ 
are /~-good, a n/~=

a=b. 
Proof: It suffices to prove that 
a = n~c/([a

C x 
is 
a 
closed

subset of Cha(x) for X E Dom (Cha) I. 
The inclusion c is trivial (as we can choose C x C a), for the other direc- 
tion - it is just Observation 2.2C. 
5.15 Claim: If /~ is a regular cardinal, W a set of cardinality

there is a set pd(W,/~) such that:

So 
~(,) + ]* I" < (s~)~ hence 
I~1" < ~. 
Let ai C t%, (i < S7(')+1) be distinct subsets of t~e of power ~. 
So w.l.o.g, we can replace ~a, : i < ST(')+I{ by any subfamily of the same cardi- 
nality, and we shall use this freedom. 
Let

Now k <1~7(, ) , p(i) < A hence w.ho.g, fl(i) = fl(*) for every i (as for I~7(o)+ 1

First assume ~ > t~ 0 (alternatively, use ~ + t~ 1 in all the proof, and get a

LeL 7? be an increasing sequence of ordinals < fl(*) converging to ~(*) ( possi-

Let A(*) =M S F~R N~cI|

we shall prove that

For this it suffices to prove that for every i for some ~7 c Y~,

w Concluding Remarks and Questions 
Looking at w the following question looks natural: 
6.1 Problem: Suppose k has cofinality ~0 , k > 3 t%, and for every 
A) Are there for any X < At%, cardinals k n < A and ultrafilter O on ~ such 
that 
x hn/D has cofinality X+? 
B) Can we replace X + by any regular X t - At%? 
Note that if we replace t~ 0 by an uncountable regular cardinal ~, the 
answer to A) and B) are positive by [Sh 80b] . The answer to A) is positive if 
A < t~ x , by w 
Note that it seemed that the usual forcing give universes with 
positive answer. 
It is also natural to ask. 
6.2 Problem: For A = tr 
as in [Sh 1987a] ( e.g., if there is no inaccessi- 
ble cardinal < A, then there is no inaccessible cardinal < At%). 
Clearly a positive answer to 6.1 and 6.2 will answer positively: 
6.3 Problem= Can we strengthen the results of w to the parallels to [Sh 
198o?] 
However we believe that particularly a positive answer to 6.1 has an 
interest in itself, even if 6.3 fails. 
Other natural questions left open are: 
6.4 Problem= Can we improve the bounds in w e.g., 
A) if ~ 
is strong limit, is 2 t% < t~l? (Similarly 2 t%1 < t~ when t~, is 
strong limit)? 

454 
B) If G.C.H. holds below t~ , 6 < tl~, cf ~ = 80, can we improve the bound? 
So the question in (A) is which bound is right, the upper bound of Galvin 
Hajnal [GH] and w here or the lower bound from [Sh 198?c] (improving Magi- 
dot [Mg ]). 
The following is widely discussed: 
6.5 Problem: What is the consistency strength of e.g. "tl~ strong limit 
and 2 ~0 > tl~o+l" 9 
So again the usual interpretation is whether we can use cardinals smaller 
than supercompact, or can we build inner models for supercompaet cardi- 
nals. 
We can also repeat the questions of [Sh 198?a] 
6.6 Problem: 1) (Hajnal) if ~, the ~l-th cardinal in C" (see w 
is strong 
limit, can 2 x be arbitrarily large below the first inaceesssible? 
11 l 
3) If A is the first )k = ll xofcofinality~l , 2~ <k<22 
,and 
2R~ 
(V/z < A)(/~ t% < k); then can we bound A~'? and even if ;k -~ 2 
, can the bound 
be the (3~l')+-th cardinal/~ = R~? 
We can also continue the investigation of w and get some more informa- 
tion: 
6.7 Claim: In the context of w replacing the 6 by ~ assume 
(Va <~)N~<II~. 
Suppose A c/-| 
, A C(Na,NT(.)] then A cI x-I<x 
implies 
/t ~ tIT(.). 
Proof: For every X E A there is B x c I n - I<x, B x c R A (2~,~I~), and let 
B = OBx. 
Let afxA c TBx (for i <X) be such that fx,i < fxj m~ 
I<x (for 
~A 
s <J <X) and for everyf c TBxforsomei 
)' <j'xAmodI<x.

[H(fi) : i < io] is a cover of T A. 
Another reasonable question is how much the [<x from w depend on ~.

If A C R V3 (2~(*),Sa) , IA I -- ~(*), then T A has a cover of power "= 1~7(, ).

Some people may be interested 
in simplifying the proof in w 
even at the 
expense of weakening the theorem. 
There is no problem in doing this to some 
extent (in fact the author first proved the weaker theorem). 
One way is to assume 
S~ is strong 
limit, ~<ll~,cf~=g, 
and do the 
analysis of 5.1, 5.10 with I~1 for g. So we have the parallel of the fact from 

457 
the 
proof 
of 
6.8, 
with 
af B 
(2 I~l

where 
T( *) < (2151) +, 
and 
if we 
use 
6.8 
even g(*)<(1~1~)§ 9 Now for 
every 
a ctl~ , ]a] =~, we can define a sequence of models M,, i </2+, where /2 is 
e.g. (217(')+~1) ++ which are elementary submodels, of M~, increasing with i, 
of power ~/2 and Sup (X f~ M~) c M,+ 1 for X < t~. If M~ is defined, we let Ch~ be 
Ch,(x) = Sup (M, A X) 
(for 
X 9 R O (~l~l , ~) 
and 
so 
there 
are

such 
that 
Ch~ < Max fx(~,~,i(~)

demand Range f ~(~j~)~(,,~) C M,+I for ~ < n,. 
Moreover, we demand for each

Ec(B,x,M~) its 
closure, then $ 9 Ec(B,x,M,) ~

Now 
there 
is 
a

such 
that 
for 
i 9 
, n, =n(*),B(i,s 
x(i,g) =X(g). 
As we have chosen j(i,s 
minimal, 
we 
can 
assume 
j (i ,~ ) 
increases 
with 
i. 
Let 
j (s 
= Sup lJ (i,~) - i </2+], 
and 
af ~ 
be 
defined 
by:

f~(@) = infISup |fx~)!~ " ~ 9 C~ " C a closed unbounded subset of J(~).l- Now 
easily the characteristic 
functions of M~,. is Max f~, this function determines 
M~., and there are "few" such functions. 
A 
look 
at 
w 
can 
reveal 
also 
that 
e.g. 
if 
(Ya < ~)S~ < S~, 
cf 6 = g , A c I| - It%., but any unbounded 
subset BI of B satisfies this too 
and A - B 9 IS~,. We can continue such analysis: if A ~ I<x, regular that for 
someBcA

tcA-B

In w we can in the definition of the game replace r by a (stationary) 
sub- 
set S of X, and in the definition of winning a play we replace "cf v~ = ~,, by 
"~ 9 S'; 
This does not change much the proof, but does not seem to help in 
anything either. 
In w 
if we assume W, V have the same cardinals, we can simplify the proof 
of the strong covering lemma, I think even ((X*)+) v= ((k*) +) w suffice. We can 

458 
try then to weaken the assumption ~ < X < A*, but I have not tried. 
Also we 
can weaken "W have scales "', to " for every singular cardinal X (in I0 there 
are 
fj(J < X ++) Jr c 7r(R (3 X) 
such 
that 
for 
every 
J" c T A , A C R ~ X I AI < X, for some j, f <~ 
But again as there is no 
application in mind we have not checked. 
The following is a partial positive answer to problem 6.1. 
6.10 Lemma : Suppose l~$ is a singular cardinal of cofinality t~ 0' and for 
every~<~ 
, II~ t<ll a,and 
(*) there is a family F of t~j functions, with domain R CI tla , such that 
f(X) < X for X ~ Domf, 
such 
that 
if Dom f 
is a 
countable 
subset 
of 
R (3 Ila , f (X) < X 
then 
(2g c F) f 
< g 
then, 
in 
w 
terminology 
= 1~ l~ R~ _ ~], 
Remarks: 1) Remember that when cf t~ a > tl 0' a stronger theorem holds 
by [Sh 1] 
8) This proof can serve as a part of another 
proof of 5.1 (by 
5.16), when we strengthen the hypothesis. 
Proof: Define M ~ as in 5.12 . Now there is a family F as in (*). 
Letfln <~,~= 
U~ 
Now for every countable 
a era, 
we defined by induction on i < o 1, a 
model M(a,s 
and a function g (a,s 
as follows: 
1) M[a,O]istheSkolem-hullof= 
Ul~gn :n <~]inM 
~ 
8) g [a ,r ] is a function from F such that 
(Vx e R n M[=,~])(Sup (u[=,i] n x) < g[~,~](x)) 
3) 
M[a ,i+1] 
is 
the 
Skolem 
hull 
of 
the 
closure 
of 
M[a ,: ] U Range (g [a ,i]) in (M~ 
[a ,j ])j~ 

459 
4) M[a,i] , i limit is uM[a,j] 
y<i 
Clearly those demands 
define M[a,i], g[a,i] 
choice in 2) ). 
(except the arbitrary 
NowM[a] = U M[a,i], F[a] = ~g[a,i] :i <~1~ and clearly 
A) F[a] is a subset of F of power ~ 1

C) forx9 
AM[a] 
Sup (M[a] NX) =Sup~g(x):g 
EF[a]I 
Hence by the proof of 2.3 
(note M[a] N M[b] is unbounded in ~ 
as 
#,~ 9 M[~] n M[b]). 
D) if Y[a ] N F[b ] is uncountable then M[a ] = M[b ]. 
By trivial cardinality computation (as a is a countable subset of M[a], 
and M[a] has power ~i) 
E) the set lb " b a countable subset of ~a, 
M[b] = M[a]l has power 
< 2 t%. 
Now suppose t~7(. ) ~ k < bt~ ~ and we shall eventually get a contradiction. 
Let 
ia~ : i < k +] 
be 
distinct 
countable 
subsets 
of 
~. 
Define 
G: G(i)=lj:M[ay] =M[ai] ], so by E) G(i) is a subset of ~,+ of power 
--< 2 B~ < ~ < A. Hence by the Hajnal free subset theorem (in fact, already by a 
previous theorem of Fodor) w.l.o.g, j ~ G(i) for i # j. It follows by D) that 
F[a,] N F[aj] is countable for i < j < A +. As [F] = ~j it follows that there is 
a family of A + subsets of Hy(,), each of power ~1, the intersection of any two is 
countable. By [Sh 2 ] theorem x.xx it follows that there are ~/": ~7(') (i < ~l) 
and a filter D on ~l, such that 
x A,/D has cofinality A+, for using this 
theorem we need 2 2Bt < ~6. 

460 
But third contradict lemma 6.10 (for applying if we need/~i < ~I~i for every 
< I~a). So we get the desired contradiction. 

XIV ON WEAK DIAMONDS AND THE POWER OF EXT 
w Introduction. 
In [DS] K. Devlin and S. Shelah introduced a combinatorial principle 
which they called the weak diamond. 
A 
Explanation: Jensen's [Je 72] diamond for t~ 1 - ~ 
can be formulated 
l 
as: There exists a family of functions Iga : a -~ a Iot < Wl] such that for every 
f :~1 -~1 
we have la<~l 
:f ra=gal 
~0mod 
D 
(recall from the intro- 
duction 
to 
the 
book 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
last 
proposition). 
Clearly 
~bt ==> 2 t% =t~ 1. Jensen also proved that 2 t% =t~ 1 ==~ ~ 
(see Chapters V 
1 
1 
and VII remembering that ~ 
imply existence of an Aronszajn tree which is 
1 
not special [Souslin tree]). You may ask, is there a diamond like principle 
which follows from 2 t% = t~l? 
K. Devlin and S. Shelah answered this question positively, they formulated a 
principle ~ which says: 
(VF:~'>2 -* 2)(2g : w 1 -* 2)(Yf:co 1 -, 2)la < ~1 :F(fra) = g(a)l 7 0mod 
D 
They proved that 2 s~ < 2 sl ~ 
~. The principle @ was used as a successful 
replacement of -~'" in [Sh 1987], [AS], [Sh 81d]. 
e~ can easily be generalized to higher cardinals than ~1, for example define for 
uncountable regular ~: 
O~ <=> (VF: x>2 -* 2)(:3g : X -, 2)(Vf : X -, 2)~a < A" F(fra)=g(a)] 7 0mod D A. 
2 
So 9 <=> 
0 
There are other two natural generalizations. 
Change the 
hi1" 
range of F and g from 3 to an arbitrary cardinal, and change of the range of 
f and respectively also the domain of F. 

462 
These generalizations 
are our goal in the first section but instead 
gen- 
2 
eralizing 
r 
we generalize its negation possible generalization 
is 
~ 
for 
2 < • - S 0 which by VII w is stronger (its negation is consistent with G.C.H.). 
We do not assume the reader is familiar with [DS], for example the hard direc- 
2 
tion of 
r 
~ 
21% < 2 I% follows from Theorem 
1.10 substituting 
~, = l~ 1 and 
bt2 
a 
/~ = 2. This generalization 
of 
r 
was used in [Sh 1987] w and mentioned 
bl, 
there in a remark, since we were asked to explain it, we present it here. 
In section 2 we present 
applications of the principle from w to Whitehead 
problem, we shall use it for two theorems. 
The first, Theorem 2.2 which evalu- 
ates the cardinality of Ext (G,H), and the second one is Theorem 2.4 where we 
give information 
on the torsion free rank of Ext(G,H). We shall define here 
all the group theoretical 
terminology 
and shall use only one easy lemma 
which we quote from somewhere else. But this section is not an introduction 
to the subject of Whitehead problem; the interested 
reader is refered to the 
book of P. Eklof [Ek] or to the original papers 
where the corresponding 
theorems 
were 
proved 
(from 
stronger 
set 
theoretical 
hypothesis 
) [Sh 
74],[HHS]. 
In [DS] another combinatorial principle was introduced: 
Let ~ < ~1 (limit ordinal tess than ~1), an increasing sequence ~ 
of ordinals 
cofinal in ~ is called a ladder on ~, a ladder system ~ = !~7~ : ~ < r 
has the 
uniformization property if for every IC~ c ~2 : ~ < ~1] there 
exists h E ~12 
such 
that 
(u 
< ~l)(3n < r 
< ~)[/c > n -, C~(k) = h(~7~(k))]. 
In w 
we 
define what is the uniformization property for ordinals 6 < ~2 i.e., the ladders 
~Ta are now cofinal sequences 
of ordinals in ~2- We try to prove an analogous 
result to the above, and we shall prove it assuming 2 t% = I~1; for more details 
see the introduction 
to section 3. 

463 
w I, Unif - strong negation of the weak diamond 
2 
Let's recall that the negation of 
r 
is: 
(3F:~'>2 ~ 2)(Vg :CO 1 -* 2)(Hf :~l -" 2)la < c01 "F(fra) = g(a)] c 
D 
This is the 
btl 
movitivation for the following definition (we replace sometimes functions by 
sequences, when sequences are easier to handle). 
1.1 
Definition: 
For 
a 
regular 
uncountable 
~, 
and 
sequences 
: <~(i):i < k>, ~ = <~((i)" i < k> of cardinals 
-> 1 let Ur~if (A,~,~) means: 
There is a function F with domain D(p) = (j x ~(i) such that: 
a<~'t <a 
(a) for every a < ~, ~7 E ixa~(i) ~ 
F(V) < 2(a) 
• 
• 
(b) 
for 
every 
n 
there 
exists 
such 
that 
[a < h : FO?ta) = h(a)l c Dn. 
Notation: (1) If ~ is constant, i.e., ~ = <p~" i < k> we write ]z; similarly 
for ~. 
(2) 
If 
(Va<~)~(l+a)=~(i) 
we 
write 
<~(0),~(1)>, 
when 
/z(0) =/~(1) we write instead Unif (k,/z(0),/z(1),~), Unif (A,/z(0),~). 
(3) From now on we assume that ;k is an uncountable 
regular 
cardinal. 
(4) Remember that we use 5 always as limit ordinal so for S C 
the set 15 < ~, : ~ c S] is the set of limit ordinals which belong to S. 
Remark: (1) Unif (X,2,2) is the negation of 
the weak diamond. 
2 
r 
i.e., it is the negation of 
(2) We shall say that the function F exemplify 
~if 
(~,~,~). Now 
please recall that Jensen's 
Oi ~ has a stronger 
form i.e., VS 
C~I 
stationary 
l 
r 
holds. Similarly we can strenghten our Unif. 

464 
1.3 Definition: Let A,~,2 be as in Definition 1.1 and let S C A. 
(1) 
Unif(A,S,~,R) 
is defined 
Unif (A,~,R) just replace (b) there by 
(b') 
for 
every 
h 9 x R(a) 
a<A 
~ 9 s : F(nt~) = U(,~)] 9 D~, + s. 
(2) Let Id 
similarly to 
the 
definition 
of 
there exists 
77EaX<x~Ca 
) such 
that 
Unif (h,~,2) = IS cA" Un/f (A,S,~,R) holds {. 
Remark: The notation of Definition 1.3(2) will be justified in Lemma 1.9 
i.e., we shall prove that Id Unif (A,~,2) # P(A) ~ 
Id Unif (A,~,~) is an ideal. 
1.4 Lemma: Let A,S,N,R be as in Definition 1.3. 
(1) If li < h :R(i) = 1~ c D, then Unif (A,S,~,2) holds. 
(2) Let R1~2 satisfy the requirements for 2 in Definition 1.1. then 
[i 9 S : ~1(i) = ~2(i)1 9 Dx + S imply that Unif(A,S,~,~ 2) <:=> Unif(A,S,~,~) 
(3) 
Unif(A,S,~,~) 
imply 
that 
Ila<x~(a)/(D~+S)ll-aH<x~(a) 
(notice that the left hand side of the inequality is the cardinality of a reduced 
product. 
(4) 
If 
there 
exists 
a 
fl < A 
such 
that 
]]axx~(a)/(D~+S) ]] <-- II ~(a), then Unif (A,S,~,~) holds. 
(5) Let R*,~* be sequences of cardinals of length A such that for 
every 
a < A 
R*(a) ~ ~(a) 
and 
/~(a) ~ ~*(a) 
then 
Proof: Easy. 
1.5 Lemma: Let A,S,~,R be as in Definition 1.2. Suppose/z 0 = ~, II ~(i), 
and/z i = Min ~ 
II ~(a+i) then the following are equivalent. 
a<A is<a* <• 
(i) ~$ (~,s,~,~) 

465 
Proof: (2) ~ 
(1): 
Let F exemplify Uni$ (/~,S,/z0,/~l,~) , and we define two functions: F ~ , g ", 
such that F" will exemplify Uni I (h,S,~,y~) and this will be proved as follows: 
x 
choose 
7/ 
given 
h e a<x~(a) 
we 
9 xx~(a ) 
such 
that 
S 1 e D;~ + S 
where 
S 1 =[~9 
then 
let 
77"=g*(~7), 
and 
prove 
~/'(0)</z 0, 
~7"(1+i) < ~zl 
and 
S 1 = 16 9 S : F'(~7*t6) = h(~)lmod D A 
so 
[~ 9 S 9 F~176 
= h(6)] is in D~ + S, andwe shall finish. 
Clearly for some a(*) < h, (Yi)(a( *) <-- i < h ~ N(i) <- izl) and ~<afII)N(i) is 
<-/z 0. So let lu~:~<~0 
<-/z0] be a list with no repetition of all members of 
x(.)N(i), 
and 
now 
define 
g'(~) 
for 
~7c x N(i), 
a~/t. 
If 
a<a(*), 
g'(~7)=<>, 
if a:~('), ~7=u~ then 9"(~7)=<(>, 
and if a>a(*) 
g'(#) =g(~ra('))^<~?(i): 1~i <g(~7)>. 
Clearly from g'(~7) we can recon- 
struct ~1, so it is easy to define F ~ as required. 
Y*(u) = F(~7) if u = g'07) 
F'(v) = 0 otherwise. 
(1) ==> (2). 
The 
scheme 
is 
as 
in 
the 
first 
direction, 
only 
now 
F 
exemplify 
Unif (A,S,N,~) and F" will exemplify Unif (X,S,No,Nl,2). For simplicity assume 
@ 2<--~(i)<--~(j)foreveryi 
<j <A. 
Let ~v~r: ~ < ~<x ~(7§ 
be a list with no repetition of U x_~(7+i) for

n~(~) = | ]10 
i=aj+l

For ~/E D(/~0,/~l) we shall define g *(v) < g *01)

g ~

the

For a = I1 + 1, g "07) = g "O?t~) ^ 7;[ where 7 is the length of g "O?t~) and

reconstructed 
from g "(~) so we can define F ~ as required: 
Io 
otherwise 
Clearly ~? can be 
Nowg ~ 
e D(~) byO. 
We have only one problem left: what occurs if O fails? Really this is not 
serious, by the following claim ( if ~*(j+i)= 1 for every i, then /z 0 =~(0), 
/z 1 = 1, so the lemma becomes trivial, by 1.4(3), (4), as IZr = 1). 
1.6 Claim= Let A,S,N,~ be as in Definition 1.2.

Proof: (1) Easy. Let G~ : ~'(i) -~ ~(i) (for ~ < ~) be such that for every 
<~" ~ < ~> 9 "~(i) there is a unique 9" </z*(i) such that 
(V~ < ~) G~(9") = a~; and similarly /~ : R*(i) -* ~(i) for ~ < m. If F exemplify 
U~if (A,S,~,~) let us define F*: 
F*(~7) is the unique 9' < X*(s (7/)) such that 
(vt < ~)[r< c~(n(~)): ~ < ~(~)>) = ~(9")] 
So given h 9 *x<Ax- ~ 
we have to define appropriate ~/. Let h t e xR(i)

such 
that 
h~(i) = H~(h(i)), 
there 
is

1.8 Conclusion: If s 
()t,/z(0),2,x),l < g < A then Unif (A,/z(0),2<~',X~). 
Proof: By the previous lemmas. 
1.9 Lemma : Id t;nif (k,~,~) is either ]~A) or a normal ideal on A (i.e., on 
p(A)) containing all non-stationary sets. 
Proof: By 1.5 we can w.l.o.g, deal with E = Id Unif (~,,/z0,/zl,R), and by 
the definition, trivially any non stationary S C A belong to E. So it is enough 
to prove that if S CA , (Va 6S) f(a) <a, and S i : la 6 S:f(a) 
:i I 9 
then S e E. Let F~ exemplify that, S i 9 E, let us define F: if ~7 9 D(/~0,/zl), 
~(~) 9 S t, we let F(,/) be Ft(<~7(pr(i,j)): j < j(i,~(~/)>), where pr(i,j) is a 
pairing function on A, j(i,a) = Min [j :pr(i,j) >- a] 
1.10 Theorem: If the following conditions hold: 

468 
(1) k regular and 2 <4 < 2 4. 
Then Unif (h,/~,2<x,2 <~) fail. 
Moreover instead (2) it suffices to assume 
(2') . The following property does not hold. 
(*) There is a family ISt:i 
<2~], Step, 
[Stl =k 
and i #j 
<2 4 imply 
n Sjl 
Proof: First notice that (2) ~ 
(2'). Assume by contradiction that (*) 
holds, 
choose 
T i ~ S t 
countable 
for 
every 
i < 2 4, 
we 
got 
I T~: i < 2 ~] C IS C/~: I SI = lqo], i.e., 2 4 --/~o contradiction to/~0 < 2~ 
Therefore from now till the end of the proof of t.1 1 we assume that (*) 
fail. This implies~<2 
~asif/~=2 
4 , St =[a:ki--<a 
<hi +;k] fori <2 4show 
that (*) holds trivially . We also assume the conclusion of the theorem fail 
(i.e., 
Unif (k,~,E<x,2 <~) holds) and eventually get a contradiction. 
Let F 
exemplify Unif (~,/~,2<~,2<~) Let us define: 
Mog = I( a,Co,go,Cl,g 1 ..... 
C#,g #, " " ' > #<#(o) : ~(0),a </~,g#afunction

Clearly 
I Mod ] = 2 <4 
hence 
we 
can 
fix 
a 
one-to-one 
function 
H : Mod --', 4>2. Now for every function f

B) As hf,7 : k -* 4>3 is defined, and as we are assuming (2nif (~,/~,2<~,2<~), 
there are a function g c D(/~,2<~), and a closed unbounded subset C of h such

Let C ~ =

Now we shall prove by induction i _< ~, that: 
2) 
for 
every 
r < j

gf~,r t (7~-i0]) 
and 
c:,.r n

This 
is 
enough, 
as 
in 
particular 
it 
says, 
for 
i = ~, , (= 0, 
g f ~,o t (k-|Oi = g f e,o r (~-10~), 
but 
by 
its 
definition 
gf ~,o = f g,so 
]1 r (x-10)) = f2 r (x-101). 
But in fact we assume fl(0) = f2(0), so fl = fz, which is the desired con- 
clusion of the fact. So for proving the fact, it suffices to prove (9. 
We first prove 1). 
Now for ~ = 1,2 clearly 70 ~=Min

hence 
70 ~ -~ Sup 6)~. 
On 
the

hence 
Clearly 
we 
got

Now 
We

that

This is easy: 1) holds as 7~(~--i)

Case I]]: Prove for i + 1, assuming truth for i. 
For any n < ~, gI,,J, r 7~ = gI~d. r 70 z by the assumption in the fact. By

Similarly gy,,r t (T~+I-|0]) = gl~,r t (T~+l-10|) , and so we finish to prove 
(2) of ~ hence we prove Fact 1.12. 
Continuation of the proof of 1.7. 
For every f

If AI, ~ Ay~ is infinite, we can easily get the hypothesis

fl = re- 
So AI 1 N Aye is finite for fl 
# f2- The Ay's are not subsets of/z but

1.12 Definition. Let a be an ordinal ~, a cardinal. 
(1) A family F 
of subsets 
of a

(h,a)-cover 
if for all 
S C a , IS] = h, there is T c F such that S c T, and all the elements of F are 
of cardinality h. 
(2) The covering number of (h,a) which is denoted by coy (A,a) is

and let [/z i:s

then

472 
(4) coy (x),. +=) < (~,*=)~=i 
Proof: (i) Because if F is a (k,fl)-cover, then F t = |A C~ a : A c F] is a 
(x,a)-oover I ~l -< I r l. 
(2) By (1) c0v(k, laI)-<cov(k,a). 
Let |a i:i<

(k, I a I)-cover exemplifying coy (A, I a I). Construct from it F t a (A,a)-cover by 
defininig St c Ft r162 aS e F[St = la, : i e S]]. 
It is obvious that this is a cover as required. 
(3) 
i. Obvious by taking F = Ik]. 
ii. First we shall show that coy (k,t ~+) <_ coy (~,1~) +/~+. By 
finding (k,/~+)-cover F of cardinality cov(k,/~)+/~+: 
For every 
ordinal a, 
k~ a </~+ leL F= be (X,a)-cover if (2) [Fal = cov(X, ial) = cov(;L]~). Define 
F = U 
F a is his (A,/~+)-cover: Let S ~ 1~+ of cardinality k from the regularity 
a</r 
of /~+ follows existence /~ ~ a </~+ such that S C a, since F= is a (A,a)-cover 
there is TcF=(TcFsinceFacF) 
such that Sc T, ITI =k- Now we prove 
cov(~,IZ)+l~+~cov(k,~+): 
From (1) 
cov()~,~)<cov(k,~ +) is clear. 
So it 
suffices to prove/~+ ~ coy (k,/~ +) assume by contradiction that/~+ > coy (A,/~+). 
Let F a (k,/z +) cover exemplifying cov(X,]~+), let IS~ :i < cov(~,]~+)] = F from 
the definition of a cover tJF =/~+ let's calculate the cardinalities: 
/~+= [/~+[ = [F[ = ]S~[ 
cov(X,lZ +) = cov(k,/z+). )~<-/z, contradiction. 
iii. We shall find a (A,/~)-cover F of appropriate cardinal.ity: 
For 
i < cf/z 
let 
Fi 
be 
a 
(h,/~,)-cover 
exemplifying 
cov(A,[~,), 
define 
F~ ~ = F~ L) |r 
F = [ I..) s,/. : S~ c Fr

It is easy to verify that F is a

1.14 Lemma: Let ~z < 2 x , X be cardinals, ~ regular then Unif (hjz,~,X) 
implies Uni f (X,cov (X,/z),~,X) 
Proof: We do it by translating 
every g c D(/z,/z) to g 
c D (cov(k,/~),X) 
when the first coordinate 
is like a set which cover Rang g, and g(l+i) 
is the 
g(i) place in it. That is let ~ = cov(k,/z), IA~:i < g~ exemplify this, and 
A4 = la~j : j < ~J. 
For 
a 
given 
g :/~ -*/z 
let 
g(O) = minti < g:[g(a):a

is the first j < h such 
g (i) = a~,j.. 
1.15 Conclusion: Let /z < ll~, and asume /z~< 21%, then Unif (Nl,/z,lz,2) 
fails. 
Proof: 
Assume 
by

Unif (lll,/z,/z,2); 
by 
Lemma 
1.5 
Unif (~l,lz,~z,2 <~1) 
is 
true, 
apply 
Lemma

and 
we 
have 
Unif(Nl,cov(Nl,N),N:,2<t%).

( 
let

Theorem:

(*) There is a family ~S~ : i < 2xl, S~ C/z, ]S~ ] = h + and t S~ N Sjt < n0 for

w On the power of Ext and Whitehead Problerm 
Let groups be abelian torsion free for simplicity. By [Sh 74], [Sh 75] if G 
is a non-free group and V = L then Ext(G,z) # 10]. In Hiller Huber Shelah 
[HHS], it is proved that if V = L, the torsion free the rank of ~zt (G,Z) is the 
immediate upper bound: Min lzIK] : K a subgroup of G , G~ K free I. 
Now in fact not the full power of V = L is used, just the satisfaction of the 
diamond principle for every stationary 
subset of a regular cardinal. 
Devlin 
and Shelah [DS] introduced 
a weakening 
of this principle, and in [HHS] we 
stated that for the result mentioned 
above it is enough that the weak dia- 
mond holds for every stationary 
subset 
of any regular 
cardinal. 
Here we 
prove a somewhat stronger result, using failure of cases of Unif, (e.g., X = 2t~~ 
suffice). 
Meanwhile Eklof and Huber [EH] find a~ alternative 
proof, more 
group-theoretic, 
for the result with weak diamon ~ (really - a slight weaken- 
ing) 

475 
On the difference between weak diamond and Failure of Unif, and between 
variants of Unif, see [Sh 80a] also w of this chapter and VII w (i.e. the con- 
sistency of the holding of one but not another). 
On the torsion part of 
Ext(G,Z) see Sageev and Shelah [Sg S ][ Sg S 1]; an alternative proof more 
group theoretic, Eklof and Huber [EH].

that 
h 9 Fact(A/B,H), 
h~ Trans(A/13,H) = t-s ~ O. 
Now if in A, a-c 
=beB 
then (h(a/13,b/B) 
=f*(a,b) 
=(~Sg')(a,b) = 
g*(a)--g*(a+b)+g*(b) = g*(a)--g*(c)+g'(b). 
As 
b e B, g*(b) = 0 
and 
b/ B = OA/z hence h(a/ B,b/13) = h(a/ B,OA/s) = 0 (as h e Fact(A/ B,G)). 
So 0 = g "(a )-g *(c ) + O, hence g "(a) = .q "(c). 
We can conclude that c/13 = a~ t3 implies a-c 
e 13 hence g*(a) = g *(c). 
So there 
is gt:A/13-,G,g*(a)=gt(a/13). 
We can check h =Sg t, but 
h~ TrarLs(a/ B,H) = t-s # O, contradiction. 
Proof of the Theorem 2.2: 

477 
We define by induction on a < k for every ~7 E xaX(i ) a function 
f (note that X(i) -> 1 for every i) such that: 
a) f,7 e Fact(Ga,H ) (when g(~?) = a) 
b) if v = 71 t ~, t~ <-- s 
then fv C f 
c) if $ < (" < X(a), then there are no functions go,gl from Ga+ 1 into H, 
such that ~g0 = f,j^<~>, ~gl = f,j^<r 
andg0 t G a = gl t Get. 
There is no problem in the induction, as the induction step is done by the 
Claim. 
In the end, it is enough to prove that for some 71 c xR(i) 
for no function g from G into H, f = 6g. But if for each 7/e i~<~X(i) there 
is 
such 
gn' 
then 
by 
c) 
(~? r a , f~ r G,t,g,7 t Ga) 
determine 
~(a), 
so 
Onif (A, fill <~,X) holds , but by 1.8 this is equivalent to t;nid" (A, ]HI ,X) con- 
tradiction. 
2.4 Theorem: Assume the hypothesis of 2.2, G torsion free, 
(1) Ezt (G,H) is not a torsion group provided that 
(*) a) 
IH] <--A or b) we change x(i) to be the torsion free rank of 
Ext (Gi+l/G~,H) multiply by t~ 0. 
2) If Unif (~',/~0, IH] ,~) fail then the torsion free rank of Ezt(G,H) 
is >/~0, provided that (*) holds. 
(3) Suppose Id L;niJ (A, I Hi,X) is not ~-saturated ~-> ~0 then the 
torsion free rank of Ext (G,H) is at least 2 ~. 
Remark: It is well known that the extra hypothesis in 2.4(3) is very 
weak. See proof of case II in 2.7. 
Proof: (1) We can assume w.l.o.g, that each Gt is a pure subgroup of G, 

478 
hence G a , Ga+l/ G a are torsion free. Also 
2.5 
Fact: 
There 
are 
pairwise 
disjoint 
Sn C h, ~z < r 
such 
that 
Onif(k,Sn,IHl,R) fail, provided that IH] -< k. 
Otherwise for some S c A, Id Ur~if (A, [ H ] ,~) + S is a maximal ideal on A, 
but by 1.9 it is normal, hence A is measurable. But then it is well known that 
h 
is 
strongly 
inaccessible 
and 
r 
~ 
holds; 
moreover, 
if 
S 1 ~ A, S 1 ~ Id Unif (A, IHI,R) + S then r 
31 holds, and then the fact is easy 
Cas IHI ~ x). 
2.6 Claim: Let H,A,13 be abelian groups, H a subgroup of A, A/13 torsion 
free and f E Fact (B,H) , az e Z. 
(I) Then there are f~ 9 
for i <X = ]Ez~(A/B,H) I 
such that 
(*) there are no i <] <X and functions g~,gj from A to H such that 
~g~ =nf~ , ~gi =nfj andg~ r 13 =gj r B. 
(2) Then there are f~ e Fact (A,H) for i < (the torsion free rank 
of Ezt (A/13,H) multiply by ~0) such that 
(**) There are no i =j 
and functions gi,gj fromA to H and 0<m 
< 
such that rnf~ = 6g~ , rnfj = 6g 1 and gi ~ 13 = g I t13. 
Proof: (1) As A~ t3 is torsion free, Ext(A/B,H) is divisible, hence we can 
find t~ EExt(A/13,H) for i <X such that i <j 
implies n(tj--t~) ~ O. Now 
repeat the proof of Claim 2.3. 
(2) We can choose the required number of t~'s, t i ~ Ext(A/13,H) 
such that ~zt~ = ntj 
i-j for n < 0, and continue as in 2,3. 
Continuation of the Proof of 2.4. 
Let us assume ]HI ~-- A. 

479 
Lets n CA(s 
<o) be as in Fact 2.5, andw.l.o.g.},= 
USn- 
Let us define by induction on a -< A for every • E x X(i) a function 3" such 
that 
a) ST c Fact(Ga,H ) (when s 
= a) 
b) if v=~?rfl,fl--<s 
thenfvCfT. 
c) if acS n ,~<~<X(a) 
71c x X(i) thenthere 
are no functionsg0,gl 
from 
Ga+ 1 into H 
such 
that 
6g 0 = (n+l)f~<l 
>, 6g 1 =(n+l)f~A<r 
and 
got Ga=gl r Ga. 
There is no problem in the induction as the induction step is by Claim 
2.6(1), and we finish as in the proof of 2.3 or 2.7(2) below. 
If we do not assume 
IH] <-}, but rather (*) (b), we have to use 2.6 (2) 
instead of 2.6(1). 
(2) We define f,j as in the proof of 2.4(1). 
If the torsion free 
rank of Ext(G,H) is --/z 0, then there are t a c Ext(G,H) (a < it0) such that for 
any t c Ext(G,H) , for some n > 0, nt = t a (note that w.l.o.g, tt 0 -~t~ 0 by the 
proof of 2.4(1). So there are fa c Fact(e,H), so that for every 3" c Fact(G,H) 
there are nf > 0 and a function gf from G to H and a(f ) </z 0 such that 
nf f : 6g I § fa(f). 
In particular this holds for every f~, 17 < xxX(i). Now apply the definition 
of ~f (X,~o, I HI,~). 
(3) Easy too. 
2.10 Conclusion: Every Whitehead groups is free provided that: 
for every regular uncountable A, any stationary S c }, is not small (this 
in [DS] terminology means - Unif (~,S,2,2~~ 
or even if 

480 
(91 for every regular uncountable 
k and stationary S ~ ~, Unif (A,S,2,2 I%) 
fail. 
(9" for every regular uncountable 
~ and stationary S C A, Unif (A,S,B,f) 
fail where f (~) = 2 cr $ 
Proof: We prove by induction on A, that if G is a torsion free not free, 
but with no subgroup of smaller rank H, G~ H free then Ext(G,Z) # 10] [ then 
]Ext(G,Z)[ -> 2 s~ [ then IExt(G,z)[ >-2 loll (according to which of the three 
hypothesis we use). 
The case ] G[ = l~ 0 is well known (see [HHS]) and the case G is singular is 
just like [HHS]. So assume ~. = [ G] is regular 
> 1~ 0. It is well known (see [Fu]) 
that if GT is a subgroup 
of G, then Ext(Gt,H) is a homorphic 
image of 
Ext(G,H), hence the torsion free rank of Ex~(G,H) is not smaller than the 
torsion free rank of Ext(Gt,H) , so we shall freely replace G by some sub- 
groups during the proof. 
We split the proof to cases. 
Case I: G has subgroups G ~ , Ga(a < ~) such that: 
IG ~ < X , G* c G a, Ga/ G ~ is not free and IG.:~<A] 
are independent 
over G', (i.e., if a m 9 Ga -G" the sin's distinct then 
~ z m ~ 0). 
w% ,f7% 
We choose, for any n <c0,a 
<~ , a function fn a 9 
such 
that f0 =0, 
and for n # 0 
nf n a~ Trans(G=/ G',Z) # ~0 I. 
There are func- 
tions ~i(i < ~.), from A to ~, such that for every n < co, i ~ j < 2" for some 
a, ~i(a) = 0, ~.(a) = n. 
For every i we define h i c Fact( ~.. Ga,z): 
if x = ~.x a , y = ~,Ya, 
xa,Ya 9 G 
(so xt = yt = 0 for all but finitely many 
a 
cl 
i's) then ht(x,y) = y.fa(a)(Xa/G',ya/ G ~ (the representation 
9 = ~]z= is 
not 
unique, 
but 
for 
any 
two 
representations 
x =~,,x a =~,x* a 
we 
get 

481 
xa/G" = x~a/G*, so h i is well defined). 
It is easy to check h~ c Fact(~,Ga,Z ). 
a 
Now if the torsion free rank of G (hence G t = ~.Ga) is < 2 x, there is an n 
a 
such that Inh~/Trans(Gt,Z) " i < 2x] has power < 2 x. We know that 21a'l < 2x 
(as [G'[ <A, i~nif(h,2,f) by w 
so w.l.o.g. (by renaming) rd~/Trans(Gt,z) 
are equal, fori 
<(2tG'l)+. 
So there areg~" Gt-*Z such that.-rib 
0=dg' 
for i < (2IV'l)+. Now the number 
of gi F G* is -(21g'])+ 
hence w.l.o.g, for 
every0 <i <(21~'1)+ g~t G'=g*. 
We can choose a such that ~l(a) = 0, ~a(a) = n. Now restricting ourselves 
to G a, note (hl-ho)t(GaxGa) 
o 
o 
= fet--fa, (h2--ho)r(GaxGa) :fr 
0 
and now we can apply the proof of Claim 2.3, and get a contradiction. 
So we finish case I. 
Let from now on, G = U G~ , G i increasing and continuous, [ G~[ < A. 
a.ll Subelaimc If Case I does not hold, we can assume that: 
a) for every 7 < k, there is no Gt, G 7 ~ G t ~ G, [G?] < ]k, G*/'~ GT+ 1 = G~ 
and Ext (Gt, GT) ~ O. 
b) for every limit ~, G/G,~ is (cf ~)-free, except, maybe, when cf & = n 0. 
Proof of the Subelaim: We define by induction on i < A, a~ < )~, increas- 
ing and continuous. 
Leta 0 =0, and for a limit i, a~ = Uaj. 
Ira t is defined let~G~ :~'<~'01be 
a maximal family of subgroups of G, satisfying: Ga, C G~, [G~ [ < ~,, G~/Ga, 
not free and [G~ : ~" < r 
is independent over Ga~; such family exists by Zorn 

482 
lemma, and r 
< k as Case I does not hold. 
Let at+ 1 = Min [a : a~ < a and G~ ~ G a for every r < {'0~. 
We know that a,+ 1 exists as ~ is regular, I G~ I < ~ , ~'0 < A. Also there is no 
G?, G~ c G t C G, ]G?I <h, G t N Ga~.~= Ga~ amd G?/G~ not free as this 
would contradict the choice of | G~ 9 f < ~0] as a maximal family. 
Now we can replace ~ Ga: a < A~ by ~ Ga," i < A~ and a) of the subclaim 
will hold, so w.l.o.g, a) holds, i.e., ai = i. What about b) ? Let 
S = 16 < A : G/G,~ is not (cf 6)-free cf 6 > S0 or G/G,~ is not torsion free i 
We shall show S is empty. If not, for every 6 9 S, let G~/G$ be a non-free 
subgroup of G~ G$, I G~/G~t < cf 6. 
Let [x~/ G 6 : j < I Ga/ G61] enumerate 
the members of G~/ G 8 , K 6 be the 
subgroup of G generated by Iz~:j 
< ]G6/G~]{. So IK~] =l~ 0 + ]G~/GsI. As 
we can replace G$/G$ by any non-free subgroup, w.l.o.g. G~/G 6 is torsion 
free or it is finite, x~ = (j+l)x06 (so IG'~/G6[x~o 9 G~). If G~/G 6 is torsion- 
free, ]K sl---l~0+ ]G~/G~] = IG~/G$1 <cf6. 
Hence 
there 
is 
an 
ordinal 
h(6) < 6 
such 
that 
KS (h G$ c Gu($), 
so 
(K~ + Gh(~))/Gu(~) is not free, and (K~ + Gh(~) ) C~ Gh(~)+l = Crn($), contradic- 
tion to the satisfaction of a). So both a) arid b) of the subclaim hold9 
If Gs/ G~ is finite, for some h(6) < 6, IGS/ G~]x 0 e Gu(~) and continue as 
before. 
Case II: not case I and 
S = ~6 < A : 6 not a regular cardinal ] ~ 0 rood Id Unif (A,So,~). 
We can use 2.4(3) , because of the following well-known theorem: 
Theoremc If A is regular , D a normal filter on ~, S 70rrnodD and 
6 e S ===> cf 6 < 6 ( i.e. 6 not a regular cardinal). 
Then there are pairwise 

483 
disjoints a ~: S (a < Tt) , S a ~ Omod D. 
Proof: Clearly cf () is a regressive function on S-[0~, hence for some 
,S'cS, 
S'~0modD, 
(V6~S*) 
cf6=~. 
Let 
for 
each 
~S" 
a(6,~) (~<~) 
be 
an 
increasing 
continuous 
converging 
to 
&, 
and 
let 
At,y = 16~S':a(6,$)=jJ. 
Now we can prove 
that 
for some $ for A j's 
A~d ? 0rood D, and as Atd (3 A~,r = r for i # j we will finish. 
Now by Cases I, and the subelaim; it is enough to prove 
Case HI: S = 16 < A "2(~) = 2 I~1] 7 0mod Id Unif (;~,~0,X) we first state 
(and prove later).

So le,~. us prove the theorem

Now for such an ~7, lfn,~ : A C A] exem- 
plify that the torsion free rank of Ext(G,~) is -~ 2 x. 
Proof of the subelaim: 
Let ~(i~,a~) : ~ </~1 be a list of all pairs (i,a) ,i < X, a < ~, and we define 
fQ, ar by induction on ~'. Suppose we have define fit,at for every ~ < r

Let

be

of 
Ext(G1/G~ 
such 
that 
nf(jl)-nt(j2)

~3~. 
By the proof of claim 2.3 there are 
fi(j </~) such that: ff ~ Fact(G~,g) extend fi~, and there are no n > 0, 
j(1) # j(2) < k and g : G ~ -* Z such that nffO) - nff(2) = 6g and g t G O = 0. 
We can try to let fQ,ar 
for any j <~. The only thing that can go 
wrong is (*) for the subclaim. 
So for every j 
there 
are 16,7,n :> 0 and 
gj : G ~

Now there 
are /~j's and only t~0.1~'§

5-tuples 
<N,fl,7,al,ae> 
: so w.l.o.g, for j < c0 we have the same p,7,n,al,a2. 
Also by 
the induction hypothesis, at least one of |(p,al),(7,al), (p,ae),(7,ae)] is not in 
{(i~,jal):~ < 61 hence is (ir 
so by symmetry w.l.o.g. 
(p,al) = (i~,a~) . 
Similarly for (~,a2),(T,a2). As 1~ ~ 7, al ~ aa clearly

Now similarly to [HHS] by our proof.

3.1 Discussion: As we mentioned in the introduction to this chapter 
L 
91~ < 2 llt imply that V 7 = <~Ta: (5 6 S~ > does not have the uniformization pro- 
2 
perty( the proof assuming 
~ 
(or ~ U~if 011,2,2)) is an easy exercise). 
112 
Remember that S~ = li <Ra:cf i =R#|, and for every limit ordinal 6, ~75 
stands for an increasing continuous sequence of ordinals cofinal in & As we 
promised we shall prove 2 R~ = ~1 imply every ladder system in ~1 has the uni- 
forn/zation property. But first the main definition: 
3.2 Definition: A sequence ~7 - <17~: ~ e S> has the [club] uniformiza- 
tion property if for every C aecfa 2 there is a function h " uRang07~)-*2 
6es 
(=|0,1I) 
such 
that 
(V~e_S)(~i < ef 6)(Vj)[i<j<cf ~-* C~(j) =j(~(/))] 
[(V 
e S)li<cf 3 ' C~(i) = h(~76(i))] contains a closed unbounded subset of ef 6]. 
We want to answer to 
3.3 Question: Can ~ = <~7~ B e S~> have the [club]. Uniformization 

486 
properly? 
We shall answer this question negatively for club uniformization property in 
Conclusion 3.7 assuming 
2 ~~ = ~i. 
8.4 Why for only continuous ~/~? The reader may ask what happens if we 
waive the restriction that ~ in a continuous sequence of ordinals i.e., can we 
have a positive answer to Question 3.3 for any sequence ~7~ which is cofinal in 
~? Shelah in [Sh 78a] (see also Steinborn and King [SK]) proved that even 
assuming GCH a sequence <7/~ "6 e &'~> may have the uniformization pro- 
perty. 
This shows the impossibility of some generalizations of MA to l~1-eomplete 
forcing notions. 
3.5 Convention: Let F denote a function from 
[h " h a function, Dos (h) c co 2 is countable, Rang (h) c 2] into 2 = 10,11. 
3.6 Theorem (2 ~" = bll): For any function F and ~ = < 71~ " 6 C $21> there 
is <d~: 6 e S12> , da C "'2, ( the diamond 
sequence 
) such that :for any 
h 9 co 2 -, 2, for stationarily many 6 E S~, for stationary many i < c01, 
4~(i) = F(hQv~(Y) j 
<-~). 
3.7 Conclusion: (CH) ~1 = <~Ta" 6 c $12> does not have the club uniform- 
ization property. 
Proof of 3.7: Let F(h) = h(Max Domh) 
if defined, zero otherwise. 
By 
3.8 there are for r,,7~ <~" 
6 ~ S,~>. Let C,(~) = 1-d,(~). 
Proof of 3.6: Let A be big enough (e.g., (21%)+), and M* be an expansion 
of <H(%),c> be Skolem functions (if it has a definable well ordering it 
suffices). 

487 
Suppose ~?,F form a counterexample. 
It is know that there is a function G 
from IA : A C co 2 , ]A] ~11o1 to co 1 such that G(A) = G(B) implies A,B have the 
same order type and their intersection 
is an initial segment 
of both. (for 
proof of existence 
of such a G see the explanation 
after the proof of the 
Lemma from section 2.2 in [HS] ). 
We now define a procedure 
for defining for any p c H(A), < C~ : ~ E S12>, 
C~ : ~01 -, H(~I), which we shall use later. 
For every 6 c $12 , i < r 
let/V~,, be the Skolem hull of I&,idO { in M*, and 
let 
(B C~(i) = < isomorphism type (N~.i,p,6,i), C(lV~, i (~ 112)>. 
Remarks: 1) The isomorphism type of <N~,~,p,6,i> 
is not in H(111), but 
since /~,~ is countable we can assume it to belong. 
2) (N~,i,p ,i,cS) is/V~, i expanded by three individual constants. 
Now remember 
we have assumed 
F,~7 form a counterexample. 
So for 
every 
C~c~12 
(6~S~) 
there 
is 
h 6:co 2 ~co 1 such 
that 
for 
a 
closed 
unbounded 
set 
of 
~ c S~, 
for 
a 
closed 
unbounded 
set 
of 
i < ~01, 
C~(i) = F(hd~t~(j ) : j <-- i~) . 
Now we can easily replace 2 by w2: 
Let for h 
a function 
into co2,h In] be h[n](i)= h(i)(n) 
for i E Dom h. 
Define F* by: r*(h) = <F(h [n]) : n < r 
now if Ct c r176 
i.e., Ct: c01 -* ~ 
let h [n] : ti 2 --* 2 be such that for a club of 5 c $12 for a club of i < co 1 
C['q(i) = r(h['q 
t I~,dJ) : J -< zl)- 
Define h(i) = 
: 
< 
Now as 1~21 211~ = H(111), we conclude: 

488 
(*) for every C~ 9 ~'H(81) 
(5 9 S12) there is h " ~2 -* c~ 1 such that for club 
of 5 9 S~ 2 for a club of i < ~, C~(i) = Y'(hr[~?~(j) : j <-- iJ). 
Now we define by induction on n < r 
p (n) 9 H(A), and h n : r 
-* H(~I). 
Let p(0) = <~7>. If we have defined p(n), let C~ (n) :a~ -~ H(~l) be as we 
have defined before (in @), so by (*) there is a suitable h n :~2 -* H(~); i.e., 
there is a closed unbounded 
W n C ~2 and for 5 9 W n (~ S~,there 
is a closed 
unbounded 
~ C ~o~ 
such 
that 
for 
i ~ ~ 
, 5 9 W n (~ S~: 
Letp(n+l) = <p(n),h n,wn,< W.: &9 n ~b'~>, 
Now let W= 
CI Wn, and for 59 W, W~= CI W~6. Clearly W is a closed 
unbounded 
subsetof ~2, 
W~ a closed unbounded 
subset of ~1- So for every 
5 9 If A S1 a, 
there 
is 
i(5) 9 W~; 
so 
as 
~7~(i(5)) < 5 
for 
some 
i 
|59 
v;~(i(5))=i 
I is stationary, 
so there 
are 51,52 in W C~ S~ and 
< w I such that 
A) 7/~1(~) = ~7~e(~) moreover ~/g r(~+l) = ~/~ ~(~+1) 
B) 5~ < 5a 
C) ~/~(sr 9 If~ for s = 1,2. 
So clearly we can assume 
D) 
there 
are 
no 
5~,5~ 
satisfying 
(A), 
(]3) 
and 
(C) 
such 
that 
Now as 51 < 5 a, for some i > ~, ~7~,(i) # ~7~2(i), and there is a minimal such 
i; but as 7/61,~7~ ~ are increasing and continuous, 
such minimal i should be a 
successor 
ordinal, 
so 
there 
is 
a 
maximal 
r 
r < ~1, 
~75, ~ (" = 17~z r {', 
9 /~,(r 
= ~7~(r 
e W~I N W6z. so C > ~, 7;~(C) 9 W~ implies 17~1(~) ~ ~g(r 
or 

489 
at least ~7~, r (<~t+l) ~ n~8 t ((~t+l), 
So for every n 
(~) c~[~)(r = c~(~)(r 
as both are equal to F*(h n t t~76~(j) : j ~-- •]). 
Looking at the definition of C~(n)(~) (see ~ ) we see that ]V~(~) is iso- 
morphic to /V~(~), and let the isomorphism be qn. Note that the isomorphism 
is unique (as e in those models is transitive well founded). 
By the definition of C~ (n) (~'), clearly w.l.o.g. 
g~[p (~)] = p (n), g~ (61) = 62, g~ (r = r 
Looking at p(n)'s 
definition we see that gn(~Tal)=~76, and for n >0 
g~(~.-1) = w._~ g.(~51 ) = ~-i 
g.(~-1)) 
= N~-~) 
e ~(~) 
AS N~(~ -I) is countable and belongs to /V~(~), it is also included in it, 
hence gn t N~(,~-I) is an isomorphism from /V~(~-I) onto N~:,~ -1) hence (by 
the uniqueness of gn) 
(~) g~ ~ g~-1. 
Let Ns = U N~(~,~ ),g = ugn;s~ 
is an isomorphism fromN 1onto N 2. 
By the defintion of C~(n) (~-), clearly: 
(~) O(N~,(,?) n ~2) = G(N~(~) n ~2), 
hence those sets have their intersection on an initial segment hence also 
N1 F~ ~2 , N2 C~ ~a have their intersection on an initial segment (as usual we 
are not strictly distinguishing between a model and its universe), hence g is 
the identity on N 1 C~ N2 n ~2. 
Note that clearly 61 ~ N 2 as g(61) = 62 ~ 61 , hence ~2 ~ Nt. 

490 
so clearly 
6g*-----~, 
Let 6~=Min(N~-(N 
1(3N2) ), 
g(613 =62" and 
so 
cf 61x" = cf 6e*. 
(6) 
c~ 6~" = .,. 
Otherwise by symmetry cf 61"= ~0, and as 61" c N 1, for some n, 61"E/V~[,~), 
hence there is IBm "m < r 
c 61. (3 N~,~) cofinal in 6(. 
By the choice of 
61", 16rn c N 10 N2, 
hence 
g (16m) = 16rn, 
hence 
gn(16m) = 16m; 
let 
16" = min(/V~(~)-U16m), so 16~ e N~(~) c N~(~+I) so 
6;= Sup 116~ :m < ~! = Sup (16" (3 ~J,~)) c ~(~-+~) 
e,r 
~ N 2, contradiction. 
So we have proved (6). 
Now let for g = 1,2 , ag = Nr N c01, ( it is an initial segment) 
16~ = sup(gr (3 ~ 
hence 161 = 162 ( by ~ 
definition) and call it ~. As g is 
the identity on N 1 (3 N2 N r 
c01 clearly by g's existence a 1 = a 2 and 
call it a. 
As 17~; c N1, ~75; is a one-to-one 
function 
(being increasing) 
from r 
clearly 
n~,~i) eg~ 
9"I 
i<a. 
Also N 1 ~ "r 
< r 
is unbounded 
below 6[" (remember gl 4M* as 
N~[,~) < M* for each n). 
So clearly 16 = Sup I175~i) :i < a]; but ~?~[ is increasing continuous, hence 
16 = n~,4~). 
For the same reasons 16 = V~2{a). 
Now 
77a;ta=~7~ra 
because 
g(77~;) =~', 
and 
a ~ Iu 
for 
each 
n < r 
=1,2) as 
N~ ~ "g~i is a closed unbounded subset of eo~ ': 

491

^r~(n+1) hence W n c N~ 
For similar reasons 6~'c W n for each n 
as W n c 1,~,r 
hence 
W n c N 1 (3 N2, and as NI,A ~ < M* , M ~ has Skolem functions, clearly 
N1 N N2 < M*, so W n is an unbounded subset of N 1 CI N2 CI ~2- So in/y~,w n is 
unbounded in 6~* = Min [(co a CI Ng) = (g 1 N Na)], hence g~ ~ "6~* e If n "hence 
We can conclude that ~i~,6;,~ satisfy the requirements 
(A),(B),(C) on 
61,62, ~. Hence by requirement 
(D) on them, 61 = 61",62 = 62". But then (a) con- 
tradicts the choice of ~ (~- c Ng hence r < a), so we get a contradiction, thus 
finishing the proof of the theorem (3.6).

Remark: The same proof works for other (pairs of ) cardinals.
