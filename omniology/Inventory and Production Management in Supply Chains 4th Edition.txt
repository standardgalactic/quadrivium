Preface
Dramatic advances in information and communication technologies have allowed ﬁrms to be more
closely connected to a broad and global network of suppliers providing components, ﬁnished
goods, and services. Customers want their products quickly and reliably, even if they are coming
from another continent; and they are often willing to look for other suppliers if products are fre-
quently delivered late. As a result, inventory management and production planning and scheduling
have become even more vital to competitive success.
Inventory management and production planning and scheduling have been studied in consid-
erable depth from a theoretical perspective. Yet, the application of these theories is still somewhat
limited in practice. A major gap has existed between the theoretical solutions, on the one hand,
and the real-world problems, on the other.
Our primary objective in the ﬁrst three editions of the book was to bridge this gap through
the development of operational inventory management and production planning decision systems
that would allow management to capitalize on readily implementable improvements to current
practices. Extensive feedback from both academicians and practitioners has been very gratifying in
this regard. Our primary objective is unchanged in this revised edition. In the third edition, we
placed an emphasis on how computing tools, such as spreadsheets, can be used to apply the models
presented in this book. While sophisticated supply chain planning software is now widely available,
we still ﬁnd that spreadsheets are ubiquitous in practice. As such, we have retained and expanded
content on the spreadsheet application of the models in this book.
Advances in information technology have made it easier for ﬁrms to exchange information
with their trading partners. Indeed, much of the academic and practitioner literature on supply
chain management has focused on how ﬁrms can collaborate and share information to reduce costs
in their shared supply chains. Generally speaking, these initiatives have had a positive economic
impact. As discussed in Chapter 1, inventory as a percent of sales, and logistics costs as a percent of
gross domestic product, have been consistently declining. Our opinion is that these savings are just
the tip of the iceberg. It is now commonplace for an employee in an inventory or manufacturing
planning role to (a) have powerful tools on their personal computer, and (b) have access to demand
and supply-related data. This means it has never been easier to implement rigorous planning mod-
els such as those presented in this book. This is not to say that it is easy, just easier than before.
There are new challenges to planning in modern supply chains where operations are distributed
throughout the globe and across many companies. As such, we have included new material in this
edition addressing how to collaborate from a planning perspective across departments within an
organization and with external trading partners.
As with all editions of this book, we have drawn on the writings of literally hundreds of
scholars who have extended theory and who have implemented theory in practice. We have also
incorporated many helpful suggestions from our colleagues.

Preface
Where appropriate, new modeling approaches and an updated discussion of the literature have
been added throughout the book. Here, we brieﬂy highlight some of the major changes in this
edition.
1. The ﬁrst two chapters from the previous edition have been updated and streamlined into
one chapter. This chapter highlights recent macroeconomic trends in inventory and logistics
costs, and includes a discussion of how these changes aﬀect operations and corporate strategy.
2. Chapters from the previous edition on Just-in-Time and short-range production scheduling
have been updated and consolidated into a single chapter.
3. A new chapter on coordinating inventory management in the supply chain has been added.
This chapter addresses collaboration and coordination within a ﬁrm through processes such
as sales and operations planning, as well as external collaboration through initiatives such
as collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment, and vendor managed inventory.
Contractual approaches for coordinating inventory decisions between ﬁrms are also covered.
4. The treatment of how to manage inventory for items with low-volume, erratic, or non-
stationary demand has been expanded. This includes the addition of derivations and
spreadsheet applications for the Poisson distribution.
5. The discussion of supply chain planning software tools including Enterprise Resource
Planning (ERP) systems and advanced planning tools has been updated and expanded.
6. The treatment of managing multiple items through the use of composite exchange curves has
been expanded. To accompany this material, data sets and associated problems are available
as supplemental material. These data sets provide students with the opportunity to apply the
concepts in the book to realistic, practical settings.
We have continued to attempt to provide a deep and rigorous treatment of the material without
presenting complicated mathematics in the main text. Additional derivations have been added
in this edition, but this content generally appears in an appendix. We have chosen this style of
presentation deliberately so that suﬃcient material of interest is made available to the analytically
inclined reader, while at the same time providing a meaningful text for a less analytically oriented
audience.
Section I of the book presents a discussion on inventory management and production planning
decisions as important components of total business strategy. The topics covered include operations
strategy, the diverse nature of inventories, the complexity of production/inventory decision making,
cost measurement, and an introduction to the important concept of exchange curves. A separate
chapter is devoted to the determination of forecasting strategy and the selection of forecasting
methods.
Section II is concerned with traditional decision systems for the inventory control of individual
items. The use of approximate decision rules, based on sound logic, permits realistic treatment of
time-varying (e.g., seasonal) demand, probabilistic demand, and the many diﬀerent attitudes of
management toward costing the risk of insuﬃcient capacity in the short run.
Section III deals with special classes of items, including the most important (Class A) and the
large group of low-activity items (Class C). Also discussed are procedures for dealing with items
that can be maintained in inventory for only relatively short periods of time—for example, style
goods and perishable items (the newsvendor problem).
Section IV addresses three types of coordination of groups of items primarily in nonproduc-
tion contexts. First, there is the situation of a family of items, at a single stocking location, that
share a common supplier, a common mode of transport, or common production equipment. The

Preface

second type of coordination is where a single ﬁrm is managing inventory across several of their
locations in a multiechelon network. For such a setting, replenishment requests from one stock-
ing point become part of the demand at another location. The third context is where items are
managed across a network where locations in the network are managed by diﬀerent ﬁrms. This
setting requires new approaches to share information and align incentives among trading partners
to eﬀectively manage inventory throughout the supply chain.
Section V is concerned with decision making in a production environment. A general
framework for such decision making is presented. It covers aggregate production planning, mate-
rial requirements planning, enterprise resource planning systems, JIT, OPT R⃝, and short-range
production scheduling.
This book should be of interest to faculty and students in programs of business administra-
tion, industrial/systems engineering, and management sciences/operations research. Although the
presentation is geared to a foundational course in production planning, scheduling, and inventory man-
agement, the inclusion of extensive references permits its use in advanced elective courses and as a
starting point for research activities. At the same time, the book should continue to have a broad
appeal to practicing analysts and managers.


Acknowledgments
The manuscript, as is often the case, had its origin in the teaching notes used by the authors for
several years in courses they taught at the Amos Tuck School at Dartmouth College, The University
of Auckland, Boston University, The University of Calgary, The University of Canterbury (New
Zealand), The Smeal College of Business at Penn State, The Swiss Federal Polytechnique Institute,
and the University of Waterloo. A large number of students (including many part-time students
holding employment in industry) have provided excellent critiques.
A signiﬁcant portion of the book has developed out of research supported by the Natural Sci-
ences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the Defence Research Board of Canada, and
the Ford Foundation. Support was also provided by the Tuck School, the School of Business at the
University of San Diego, and the Center for Supply Chain Research in the Smeal College of Busi-
ness. The authors gratefully acknowledge all the aforementioned support. Numerous consulting
assignments involving the authors have also had substantial inﬂuence on the contents of the book.
Special mention must be made of two authorities in the ﬁeld who, early in our careers, encour-
aged us to work in the general area of inventory and production management—namely, Robert
G. Brown, as a colleague at Arthur D. Little, Inc., and Morris A. Cohen, as a PhD advisor at the
Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. Also, we wish to express our sincere thanks to Rein
Peterson for his contributions as coauthor of earlier editions of this book.
Many of our professional colleagues have provided helpful comments concerning our research
papers, the earlier editions of the book, and the drafts of the current edition. In addition, numerous
other colleagues have made available drafts of papers in the more advanced topic areas. Many of the
publications of these contributors are referenced in this book. We appreciate all these important
contributions. The list of all these colleagues would be too long to include, but we do wish to specif-
ically mention Daniel Costa (Nestle S.A.), Robert Lamarre (Gestion Conseil Robert Lamarre), and
David Robb (University of Auckland).
Finally, on such a major task, a special word of thanks is necessary for those individuals who
have edited and proofread the many drafts of the manuscript. While a student at Penn State, Jimmy
Chen (Bucknell University) carefully reviewed the manuscript, providing very helpful suggestions
and edits. Lauren Bechtel, Sharon Cox, Rachel Gimuriman, and Denis Harp were extremely
helpful in supporting editing and formatting of tables and ﬁgures.

I
THE CONTEXT AND
IMPORTANCE OF
INVENTORY
MANAGEMENT AND
PRODUCTION
PLANNING
Since the mid-1980s, the strategic beneﬁts of inventory management and production planning
and scheduling have become obvious. The business press has highlighted the success of Japanese,
European, and North American ﬁrms that have achieved unparalleled eﬃciency in manufacturing
and distribution. In recent years, many of these ﬁrms have “raised the bar” yet again by coordinating
with other ﬁrms in their supply chains. For instance, instead of responding to unknown and highly
variable demand, they share information so that the variability of the demand they observe is
signiﬁcantly lower.
In spite of the media attention devoted to these developments, two mistakes are far too com-
mon. First, many managers assume that new levels of eﬃciency can be attained simply by sharing
information and forming “strategic alliances” with their supply chain partners. These managers do
not understand that “the devil is in the details,” and that knowing what to do with the data is
as important as getting the data in the ﬁrst place. Developing sound inventory management and
production planning and scheduling methods may seem mundane next to strategy formulation,
but these methods are a critical element of long-term survival and competitive advantage. Second,
many analysts assume that implementing sophisticated inventory and production methods will
solve all the problems. These analysts may achieve a high level of eﬃciency by optimizing given the
lead times and demand variability the ﬁrm observes. But they do not understand that this eﬃciency
is insigniﬁcant compared to the eﬃciencies available by changing the givens.

Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
In Chapter 1, we discuss the importance of inventories and production planning at an aggregate
level. This includes a discussion of the role of aggregate inventories in the business cycle. We
also present an overview of corporate strategy, and discuss the linkages of ﬁnance and marketing
strategies with inventory management and production planning and scheduling. We then present
a framework for formulating an operations strategy, and we describe how inventory management
and production planning and scheduling ﬁt in that context.
Chapter 2 presents several frameworks that will be helpful to operating managers, and to general
managers. We describe various statistical properties of inventories, and we discuss how inventories
can be classiﬁed. A useful framework for understanding diﬀerent production processes is presented.
Finally, we discuss the costs involved, and brieﬂy note where they can be found.
Since managerial expectations about the future have such a tremendous impact on inventory
management and production planning and scheduling decisions, forecasting the demand variable
is given special treatment in a separate chapter. In Chapter 3, we present a number of strategies and
techniques that could be adopted to cope with the unknown future.

Chapter 1
The Importance of Inventory
Management and Production
Planning and Scheduling
Some of the strongest and fastest-growing industries throughout the world are in the service sector.
The consulting and ﬁnancial services industries, in particular, hire thousands of college graduates
each year. This fact has prompted many to suggest that manufacturing in developed countries
has not only declined in importance, but is on a path toward extinction. It seems clear, however,
that nations care deeply about manufacturing. This is particularly true in certain industries. Our
observations suggest that, although they receive little attention in the press, the textile/apparel,
machine tool,* and food industries are considered vital. Why is this so? We think it is due to at
least two reasons. The ﬁrst is that food and machine tools are fundamental to national security.
Without an industry that manufactures and distributes food, a nation is very vulnerable if it is
isolated due to a conﬂict; and in such situations, without machine tools, the hardware that drives
the economy will grind to a halt. The second reason is employment. The textile/apparel industry
employs millions of people worldwide, many in low-skill, entry-level, jobs. Without this industry
a nation can face high levels of unemployment and has reduced capacity to bring people, such as
immigrants, into the workforce.
Many other industries including microprocessors, computers, and automobiles are also con-
sidered vital in today’s world. These industries are often the source of innovation, productivity
improvements, and high-skill jobs. Consider, for example, the productivity improvements that
resulted from the introduction of computer numerically controlled machine tools. So, while ser-
vices have been growing in importance, we submit that manufacturing is still fundamental to the
health of most modern economies. Adoption of the methods discussed in this book will ultimately
help to strengthen both developed and developing economies, to the extent that they are success-

Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
apply to service industries such as banking, hospitals, hotels, restaurants, schools, and so on, where
ﬁrms hold inventories of supplies. These stocks must be managed carefully, and in some cases,
careful management of these stocks can be critical to the performance of the ﬁrm. Two recent
studies highlight the importance of inventory management to ﬁrm performance. Hendricks and
Singhal (2009) show that excess inventory announcements are followed by a negative stock market
reaction, and Chen et al. (2007) relate abnormal inventory levels to poor stock returns.
Costs associated with production, inventory, and logistics are quite economically signiﬁcant.
Table 1.1 illustrates logistics costs in the United States. Note that the value of inventories in U.S.
ﬁrms exceeded $2 trillion in 2007, and increased to close to $2.5 trillion by 2014. Total logistics
costs, expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), have slowly decreased in recent
years, from 9.9% in 2000 to 8.2% in 2014. Several key factors continue to make eﬀective inventory
management challenging, including increasing product variety, shortening product lifecycles, and
an increase in global sourcing. Despite these pressures, inventory levels for manufacturers have been
dropping. Figure 1.1 shows inventory-to-sales ratios over time for U.S. retailers, manufacturers,
and wholesalers. The ﬁgure suggests that inventory levels were decreasing up until 2009, perhaps
starting to increase since then. In a rigorous examination of U.S. ﬁrms between 1981 and 2000,
Chen et al. (2005) report that inventory levels dropped at an average annual rate of 2%. The
majority of this improvement came from a reduction in work-in-process (WIP) inventory, with
ﬁnished goods inventories not declining signiﬁcantly. In a related study, Rajagopalan and Malhotra
(2001) also ﬁnd that raw material and WIP inventories declined for U.S. ﬁrms between 1961
and 1994.
While inventory levels as a percentage of sales have been declining, inventories have shifted
downstream, closer to the customer. Figure 1.2 shows the fraction of inventory held by manu-
facturers compared to the fraction held by wholesalers and retailers. In 1992, manufacturers held
46% of total inventory compared to 37% in 2014. There are several factors that may be causing
this shift. In recent years, ﬁrms have sourced their products from all over the globe in an eﬀort
to ﬁnd cost eﬃciencies. Global sourcing initiatives will invariably increase lead times leading to
higher inventory levels for wholesalers and retailers. A recent empirical study by Jain et al. (2013)
reported that ﬁrms with more global sourcing have higher inventory levels. In addition to global
sourcing initiatives, product variety oﬀered to customers continues to increase. Firms with many
products and short product lifecycles often have high gross margin and high demand uncertainty
(Fisher 1997). An empirical study by Rumyantsev and Netessine (2007) conﬁrms that higher gross
margin and more demand uncertainty translate to higher inventory levels. An empirical study of
U.S. retailers by Kesavan et al. (2016) observes that retailers with high inventory turnover are able
to more eﬀectively adjust purchase quantities to react to demand ﬂuctuations, and the negative
consequences of excess and shortage of inventory are far less severe for retailers with high inventory
turnover.
For analysts, managers, consultants, and entrepreneurs, the opportunities to add value to man-
ufacturing or logistics ﬁrms are enormous. On the basis of research and our own experience, it
is evident that most ﬁrms do not fully understand the complexities of managing production and
inventory throughout their supply chain. While there are certainly opportunities for the creative
manager in the realms of ﬁnance and marketing, our focus is on the beneﬁts that can be won by
careful and competent management of the ﬂow of goods throughout the supply chain. One of
the authors regularly requires students in an inventory management class to work on consulting
projects with local ﬁrms. Over the years, we have seen that in more than 90% of the cases, improved
inventory or production management would lead to cost savings of at least 20%, without sacriﬁcing
customer service. This ﬁgure has been replicated in our consulting experience as well. One of our

goals in this book is to provide the reader with knowledge and skill so that he or she can bring real
value to employers and, as a result, to the economy as a whole.
In Section 1.1, we discuss how business cycles aﬀect aggregate inventory investments. We turn
our attention to the connection between corporate strategy and inventory management and pro-
duction planning in Section 1.2. In Section 1.3, we extend the strategy discussion to the areas
of marketing and ﬁnance. Section 1.4 contains a framework for operations strategy. Section 1.5
deals with an important ingredient of decision making—namely, the speciﬁcation of appropriate
measures of eﬀectiveness.
1.1 Why Aggregate Inventory Investment Fluctuates:
The Business Cycle
It is an unfortunate fact that economies go through cycles–periods of expansion when employ-
ment rates are high and the general mood is one of unending prosperity, followed by periods
of contraction when unemployment grows and there is a general feeling of malaise about the
economy (Mack 1967; Reagan and Sheehan 1985; Blinder and Maccini 1991). As we shall see,
inventories play an important role in these cycles. Many economists have tried to compile com-
prehensive models of the business cycle to explain all patterns of ﬂuctuations that have occurred
historically (e.g., Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe 2012). To date, no one has succeeded in building an
all-purpose model. Nevertheless, it is apparent that although each cycle is somewhat diﬀerent,
especially with regard to its exact timing and relative magnitude, the cycles continue and there are
several common underlying factors. These are illustrated in Figure 1.3.
Prior to the peak labeled in Figure 1.3, the economy is expanding and managers are opti-
mistic about future sales. However, managers can be overzealous in their optimism. In fact, at the
peak, because of overoptimistic expectations, too many products are manufactured by the econ-
omy and cannot be sold. These surplus goods increase aggregate inventories, and so producers start
to decrease production levels. Eventually, the rate of sale exceeds the rate of production of goods.

Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
The resulting disinvestment in inventories creates a recession during which prices, production, and
proﬁts fall and unemployment is prevalent. The ﬁnancial crisis of 2007–2008 led to a rapid drop
in sales and a subsequent buildup of inventory. This can be seen in the inventory-to-sales ratio of
that time period in Figure 1.1.
After a time, an economic recovery is generated by a slowing in the rate of inventory liquidation.
Some top managers, expecting that prices will recover, start to slowly expand their operations
while costs are low. More and more ﬁrms slowly start to hire additional labor, purchase more
raw materials, and thereby infuse more money into circulation in the economy. Consumers, with
money to spend once again, start to bid up prices of available goods. Once prices of goods start to
rise, more and more executives get on the bandwagon by expanding their operations and thereby
accentuate the expansionary phase of the cycle. The boom that results eventually is brought to an
end when costs of materials are bid up once again by competing ﬁrms, when the labor force begins
to demand higher wages, and when the scarcity of money for further expansion causes the banks
to raise their interest rates. (At this writing, interest rates remain quite low.) The crisis phase that
follows is a period of uncertainty and hesitation on the part of consumers and business. Executives
ﬁnd that their warehouses are restocked with excess inventory that, once again, cannot be sold. The
business cycle then is ready to repeat itself as explained above.
In Figure 1.3, the following key relationships are illustrated by the data. The peaks and troughs
in corporate proﬁts before taxes precede the peaks and troughs in production. Inventory investment
lags slightly and thereby contributes to higher cyclical amplitudes in production than are really
necessary.
This explanation is, of course, highly simpliﬁed, but it does illustrate the main forces, especially
the role of inventories, at work during each cycle. Note that the expectations of business and
consumers, as well as the ability of decision makers to react quickly and correctly to change, are
important determinants of the length and severity of a cycle. Expectations about the future have
been shown to depend on the following variables: the trend of recent sales and new orders, the
volume of unﬁlled orders, price pressures, the level of inventories in the recent past, the ratio of sales
to inventories (the turnover ratio to be discussed in Section 1.3.1), interest rates on business loans,
the current level of employment, and the types of decision-making systems used by management.
It is precisely this last point that we address in this book. We want to provide managers with
sophisticated, yet understandable approaches for managing production and inventory in the supply
chain, enabling them to make good decisions in a timely manner.
Recent research suggests that business cycles are less volatile than they were 50 years ago due, in
part, to advances in inventory management and production planning and scheduling (Bloom et al.
2014). Many of the topics we will discuss in this book serve to more closely match production
with demand. Therefore, managers can have a more timely perspective on the market, and are
less surprised by economic downturns. Other models, such as the probabilistic inventory models
discussed in Chapters 6 through 9, have been shown to decrease inventory volatility when applied
correctly. Still, there is much work to be done, and there are many opportunities for knowledgeable
and creative operations managers to help their ﬁrms weather the volatility of economic cycles.
1.2 Corporate Strategy and the Role of Top Management
Earlier in this chapter, we saw that, although management of production and inventory throughout
the supply chain can be critical to the ability of a ﬁrm to achieve and maintain competitive
advantage, top managers often do not recognize the importance of these issues. Operations

managers, for their part, often neglect the role their activities play in the strategic direction of the
ﬁrm, and even in its operations strategy. Both senior and operations managers need to understand
the nature of corporate and operations strategy, and they need to understand how inventory man-
agement and production planning and supply chain issues impact other functions. In this chapter,
we brieﬂy discuss corporate strategy and the functional strategies that derive from it, including
marketing, ﬁnance, and operations.
It is important to note that some ﬁrms have reorganized, or reengineered, to eliminate func-
tional areas and replace them with business processes. For instance, a major multinational food and
beverage ﬁrm recently reengineered in a way that redeﬁned roles to be more responsive to the cus-
tomer. A common reengineering approach is to replace the operations, logistics, and marketing
functions with teams that are process focused. For instance, one team may be devoted to generating
demand, while another focuses on fulﬁlling demand. The members of the generate demand team
perform many of the tasks that traditionally have been done by the marketing department but they
may carry out other functions as well, including new product development. The fulﬁll-demand
team often looks like the manufacturing or operations department but may include other func-
tions such as supply chain, logistics, sales, and marketing. The idea is to align the organizational
structure with the processes the ﬁrm uses to satisfy its customers. Barriers between functions that
created delays and tension are removed, enabling the ﬁrm to meet customer orders in a more seam-
less way. For our purposes, the management of inventory, production planning, and supply chains
can be thought of as part of the operations function or the fulﬁll-demand process. In this book,
we shall refer to marketing and operations functions rather than to generate and fulﬁll-demand
processes. Nevertheless, the procedures and insights we present apply in either case.
It is not our intention to cover the topic of strategic planning in any depth. There are a number
of texts on this topic (e.g., Porter 1980; Mintzberg and Quinn 1991; Grant and Jordan 2015).
Instead, our objective is to show that decision making in the production and inventory areas must
not be done in a vacuum, as is too often the case in practice, but rather must be coordinated with
decisions in other functional areas by means of corporate strategic planning.
The key organizational role of top managers is strategic business planning. Senior management
has the responsibility for deﬁning in broad outline what needs to be done, and how and when it
should be done. Top management also must act as the ﬁnal arbiter of conﬂicts among operating
divisions and has the ultimate responsibility for seeing that the general competitive environment is
monitored and adapted to eﬀectively. In most business organizations, four levels of strategy can be
delineated (listed from the highest to the lowest level):
1. Enterprise Strategy: What role does the organization play in the economy and in society? What
should be its legal form and how should it maintain its moral legitimacy?
2. Corporate Strategy: What set of businesses or markets should the corporation serve? How
should resources be deployed among the businesses?
3. Business Strategy: How should the organization compete in each particular industry or
product/market segment? On the basis of price, service, or what other factor?
4. Functional Area Strategy: At this level, the principal focus of strategy is on the maximization
of resource productivity and the development of distinctive competencies.
While each level of strategy can be seen as being distinct, they must ﬁt together to form a
coherent and consistent whole. Typically, each level is constrained by the next higher one.
We will have more to say on strategic planning in Chapter 13 where a speciﬁc framework for
decision making in a production environment will be developed.

1.3 The Relationship of Finance and Marketing to Inventory
Management and Production Planning and Scheduling
1.3.1 Finance
Inventories have an important impact on the usual aggregate scorecards of management
performance—namely, on the balance sheet and the income statement.* First, inventories are clas-
siﬁed as one of the current assets of an organization. Thus, all other things being equal, a reduction
in inventories lowers assets relative to liabilities. However, the funds freed by a reduction in inven-
tories normally would be used to acquire other types of assets or to reduce liabilities. Such actions
directly inﬂuence the so-called current ratio, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities, which
is the most commonly used measure of liquidity.
Income statements represent the ﬂow of revenues and expenses for a given period (e.g., 1 year).
Speciﬁcally,
Operating proﬁt = Revenue −Operating expenses
(1.1)
Changes in inventory levels can aﬀect both of the terms on the right side of Equation 1.1.
Sales revenue can increase if inventories are allocated among diﬀerent items in an improved way.
Also, because inventory carrying charges represent a signiﬁcant component of operating expenses,
this term can be reduced if aggregate inventory levels decrease. The labor component of operating
expenses can also be reduced by more eﬀective production scheduling and inventory control.
A primary aggregate performance measure for inventory management is inventory turnover, or
stockturns. In this book, we deﬁne inventory turnover as
Inventory turnover = Annual sales or usage (at cost)
Average inventory (in $)
(1.2)
Turnover can be a very useful measure, especially when comparing divisions of a ﬁrm or ﬁrms
in an industry. See Gaur et al. (2005) for a detailed analysis of inventory turnover in the retail
sector. From Equation 1.2, we can see that an increase in sales without a corresponding increase in
inventory will increase the inventory turnover, as will a decrease in inventory without a decline in
sales.
There are several dangers with turnover as a performance measure, however. Too frequently
we have seen leaders of manufacturing ﬁrms respond to turnover less than the industry average by
issuing an edict to increase turnover to the industry average. In one company, while competitive
ﬁrms purchased some component parts, this company manufactured them because of a special
competence in this type of manufacturing. WIP inventory was necessary to keep the production
process ﬂowing smoothly. To increase inventory turnover, all they would have to do is to buy
more and make less. When the edict came down, the controller recalculated the decision rules
for inventory ordering so that lot sizes were cut and raw material inventory would be reduced.
Shipments to customers continued for a few months as warehouse inventories were depleted, but
then customer service degenerated when ﬁnished goods and component inventories bottomed out.
Rampant stockouts created massive, expensive expediting. The smaller lot sizes drove up the prod-
uct cost, and proﬁts plummeted. In short, strategic competitive advantage can have a signiﬁcant
eﬀect on the determination of the appropriate inventory turnover number.

One of the most common measures of managerial performance is the return on investment
(ROI), which represents the proﬁt (after taxes) divided by the average investment (or level of assets).
From the above discussion, it is clear that inventories have an important impact on the ROI (also
see Problem 1.18).
Finally we note that many of these relationships can be summarized in Figure 1.4, which is
due to Lee, H. and S. Whang (1997, Personal communication). Inventory is a component of
working capital, and the interest payments to ﬁnance that inventory are a component of operating
expenses. Improvements in inventory management, therefore, can have a signiﬁcant impact on
shareholder value. Likewise, improvements in production planning and scheduling can increase
customer service and, therefore, product sales, and can decrease expenses related to direct labor,
materials, and freight. Thus, net proﬁt can increase, again increasing shareholder value. It is useful
to consider other potential impacts of supply chain management, inventory management, and
production planning and scheduling on the components of Figure 1.4 (see Problem 1.14).
1.3.2 Marketing
The most common complaint we hear from operations managers about marketing is that market-
ing managers simply do not understand how diﬃcult it is to manufacture and distribute a wide
variety of products. Because of low-volume production of many products, productive capacity is
lost to setups, and product demand is more diﬃcult to forecast. Workers and equipment must
be more ﬂexible, and inventories must be higher. Marketing managers prefer a wide variety of
products because they are listening to customers and trying to respond to their needs and desires.
High inventories are desirable because demand can be met without delay. Furthermore, sales and

12
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
marketing managers may make pricing decisions, such as steep promotional discounts, that increase
unit sales, but send a shock through the factory and supply chain. These fundamental conﬂicts can
be mitigated by a process orientation as discussed in the introduction to this chapter. Even with a
process orientation, however, conﬂicts are bound to arise. This again highlights the need for senior
managers to be involved in setting policy for supply chain management, inventory management,
and production planning and scheduling.
1.4 Operations Strategy
In this section, we develop a framework for operations strategy and we emphasize the place of the
management of inventory, production planning, and supply chain in the broader context of the
operations function.
We begin by stressing again that the operations strategy of the ﬁrm should be in concert with
other functional area strategies, including marketing, ﬁnance, and human resources. Sometimes,
however, one function should take precedence over the others. One ﬁrm went through a painful
period of not responding to customer needs in a long-term eﬀort to improve customer satisfaction.
The operations group needed to develop the capability to manufacture high-quality items in high
volume. To avoid disruptions during the improvement process, customer desires were neglected in
the short term, and marketing was frustrated. In the long term, however, customers were delighted
by the level of quality and by the responsiveness of the ﬁrm.
The operations strategy itself is made up of three levels: mission, objectives, and management
levers. (See Figure 1.5.)

1.4.1 Mission
The operations mission deﬁnes a direction for the operations function. McDonald’s, for instance,
uses four terms to describe its operational mission: quality, cleanliness, service, and value. For many
years, the annual report has prominently highlighted these terms, most recently in the 2014 share-
holder letter from the CEO. Because the mission should not change signiﬁcantly over time, the
mission statement is often somewhat vague. Otherwise, it is likely that it would have to be reworded
frequently as changes occur in the environment, competition, or product and process technology.
Employees need to know that there is a consistent direction in which their company is moving.
It is important however that the mission be attractive to excellent people. If it is a sleepy state-
ment of direction that resembles the mission of most other ﬁrms in the industry, it will be diﬃcult
to attract the best employees, not to mention investors. Therefore, a mission statement should
incorporate some of the excitement of top management and should communicate to employees,
investors, and customers that this is an excellent ﬁrm.
1.4.2 Objectives
Because the mission statement is vague, it is diﬃcult to know whether or not it has been achieved.
How can one know, for instance, whether “quality” has been achieved? The second level of an
operations strategy, operations objectives, provides carefully deﬁned, measurable goals that help
the ﬁrm achieve its mission. For many years, ﬁrms have used four operational objectives: cost,
quality, delivery, and ﬂexibility.
It is critical that the objectives are deﬁned carefully, clearly measurable, and ranked. They must
be deﬁned carefully because these terms are often used loosely. Quality at a McDonald’s restaurant
is very diﬀerent from quality at a ﬁve-star restaurant, which is very diﬀerent from quality in a
hospital operating room. It is also important that the objectives be measurable so that management
knows whether they are meeting their goals or not. It is quite possible, and perhaps desirable, to
use more than one measure for each objective (for instance, warranty cost and parts-per-million
defective for the quality objective). The objectives should be rank ordered as well, so that managers
can give priority to the correct objective when it is necessary to make tradeoﬀs. A manager of a
high volume manufacturing line made it quite clear to one of the authors that, in his opinion, cost
was more important than delivery. When questioned further, however, he noted that in fact he had
occasionally gone over budget by using overtime in order to meet a due date. In other words, he
said he ranked cost above delivery, but his behavior indicated that delivery was more important.
Subsequent discussions with senior managers helped him understand that delivery was, in fact,
primary.
In the 1970s, many people in operations thought that cost and quality were opposites, as were
delivery and ﬂexibility. For instance, one could aim for low-cost production, but then it would be
impossible to achieve high quality. Likewise, if one had rapid delivery, it would be impossible to
be ﬂexible. More recent experience, however, suggests that cost and quality are complements rather
than opposites. Warranty, prevention, and detection costs decrease as quality improves. Rework
and congestion on the factory ﬂoor also decrease signiﬁcantly, thereby reducing the cost of prod-
ucts. In addition, recent experience would indicate that rapid delivery of customized products can
be possible. This is especially true with technology such as ﬂexible automation, electronic data
interchange, supplier web portals, radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID), and scanning technol-
ogy. Most ﬁrms have instances, however, in which tradeoﬀs among the objectives must be made.
Therefore, although combined improvements are possible, the objectives should still be ranked.

14
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
The cost objective can be considered in one of the three categories: low, competitive, or rela-
tively unimportant. In a low-cost environment, such as that of certain discount retailers, the goal is
to have the lowest cost products or services in the industry. Firms that aim for competitive costs do
not necessarily strive to have the lowest cost products, but rather want to be competitive with most
other ﬁrms in the industry. Some ﬁrms produce prototypes or have a unique product for which
they can charge a premium; hence, cost becomes less important. Cost measures include dollars per
unit, inventory turns, and labor hours per unit (or other productivity measures). In the United
States, low cost tended to be the primary objective of manufacturing ﬁrms from the 1950s to the
mid-1970s.
The quality objective rose to the fore in the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s with the advent
of Japanese quality improvements and the sale of Japanese products in the United States. In
particular, the automotive industry experienced the stunning eﬀects of high-quality Japanese
products. Quality can be deﬁned by understanding which of its multiple dimensions are
important. Garvin (1987) describes eight dimensions of quality: performance, conformance,
reliability, durability, serviceability, features, aesthetics, and perceived quality. Quality measures
include percent defective, percent returns, results from satisfaction surveys, warranty dollars, and
so on.
Delivery can be deﬁned on two dimensions, speed and reliability. For instance, some ﬁrms
compete on delivering within 24 hours of the customer request. Others may take longer but will
assure the customer that the products will be provided reliably within the quoted delivery time.
Some companies rank delivery last among the objectives. Prototype manufacturing, for instance,
sometimes involves complete customization and, therefore, may require long delivery times. Mea-
sures for delivery include percent on time, time from request to receipt, ﬁll rate (the percent of
demand met from the shelf), and so on.
The fourth objective is ﬂexibility. Flexibility has three dimensions—volume, new product, and
product mix. Volume ﬂexibility is the ability to adjust for seasonal variations and ﬂuctuations. New
product ﬂexibility is the speed with which new products are brought from concept to market.
Automotive ﬁrms in recent years have made great strides in new product ﬂexibility. A niche car
allows a ﬁrm to jump in quickly to low-volume, proﬁtable, markets. This ﬂexibility is impossible
if development time is eight to 10 years, as was traditionally the case with U.S. and European
manufacturers. Most manufacturers have now reduced development time to roughly three-and-
a-half years, a target ﬁrst reached by several Japanese automotive ﬁrms. Product mix ﬂexibility is
the ability of a company to oﬀer a wide range of products. This may simply mean that the cat-
alog contains many items, or it may mean that the ﬁrm has the ability to develop customized
products. Many machine tool companies produce a single product for a given customer, and
then never produce that exact product again. Hence, they would rank product mix ﬂexibility very
high.
It has been argued that delivery and ﬂexibility are the most important objectives in some indus-
tries because cost-cutting programs and quality improvement programs have “leveled the playing
ﬁeld” on cost and quality. These ﬁrms then compete on “time”—rapid introduction of new prod-
ucts and rapid delivery of existing products. The phrase time-based competition has been used to
describe this phenomenon.
Finally, we note that the objectives are dynamic. For instance, as a new product begins full-scale
production, the ﬁrm may emphasize ﬂexibility (to design changes) and on-time delivery so that
market share is not lost to competitors. Over time, as the product design stabilizes, the emphasis
may change toward quality and cost.

1.4.3 Management Levers
Although the operations objectives provide measurable goals, they do not indicate how a ﬁrm
should pursue those goals. The 10 management levers—facilities, capacity, vertical integration,
quality management, supply chain management, new products, process and technology, human
resources, inventory management, and production planning and scheduling—provide the tactical
steps necessary to achieve the goals.*
It is interesting to note that in the late 1970s, researchers did not include quality management,
supply chain relationships, new products, and human resources in the list of management levers
(Wheelwright 1978). Today, these areas are considered critical to competitive success. It is also
certain that new levers will be introduced in the next decade. The categories for the operations
objectives, on the other hand, have not changed.
Facilities decisions concern the location and focus of factories and other facilities. Where does
a company locate its factories and distribution centers to meet the needs of its customers? Is there a
need for multiple facilities or is a single location suﬃcient? Does each facility perform all functions
or is one facility focused on a particular market, a particular process, or a particular product? (See
Sheu and Krajewski 1996). Many manufacturing companies have one plant that acts as a “parent
plant” that is responsible for odd-ball parts and new product introduction. When products reach
high-volume manufacture, they are moved to a satellite plant where eﬀorts are focused on excellence
in that particular product and/or process. It is critical to evaluate each plant manager based on the
speciﬁc charter for his or her facility.
Capacity decisions involve magnitude and timing of capacity expansion. Capacity decisions
interact with the facility location decisions. For instance, some ﬁrms set limits on the number of
employees that may work at any one location; by remaining smaller than a given size, better com-
munication and teamwork are possible. As demand grows, additional expansion at the same site
would violate the limit, and a new plant site must be found. A Massachusetts textile manufacturer
had rapidly expanding sales in Europe. When capacity in the Massachusetts factory was no longer
able to meet total demand, they had to determine whether to expand in Massachusetts, elsewhere
in the United States, or in Europe. The ﬁnal decision was to build in eastern Germany to exploit
lower transportation costs and import duties for European sales, and to take advantage of tax breaks
oﬀered by the German government.
Vertical integration concerns make/buy decisions. Some ﬁrms make components, perform ﬁnal
assembly, and distribute their products. Others focus only on product design and ﬁnal assembly,
relying on other ﬁrms to manufacture components and to distribute ﬁnished goods. Facilities,
capacity, and vertical integration decisions are primarily made for the long term because they
involve bricks and mortar and signiﬁcant investment.
Quality management encompasses the tools, programs, and techniques used to achieve the qual-
ity goals. It is distinct from the quality objective in that the objective speciﬁes the deﬁnition and
measurable targets, and the lever speciﬁes the means to achieve the targets. Quality management
includes things such as statistical process control (SPC), Taguchi methods, quality circles, and
so on. Many aspects of process improvement fall under this management lever, although process
improvement leads to increased productivity as well as improved quality. It is important to note
that diﬀerent deﬁnitions of quality may dictate the use of diﬀerent quality procedures.
* Portions of this discussion are drawn from Fine and Hax (1985).

Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
The supply chain management lever focuses on relationships with suppliers and customers.
Indeed, it is concerned with the entire network of ﬁrms and activities from, say, digging ore out of
the ground, to getting the product into the hands of the customer. Furthermore, it is concerned
with the handling of the product after it has ﬁnished its useful life. In general, supply chain man-
agement uses tools to eﬃciently move information, products, and funds across the entire supply
chain. Chapter 12 contains an extensive discussion of supply chain management.
The new products category involves the procedures and organizational structures that facilitate
new product introduction. The days of a focused team of engineers working without input from
marketing or manufacturing are gone. Most ﬁrms now employ multifunctional teams, composed
of design engineers, marketing personnel, manufacturing managers, and production line workers.
The new product lever speciﬁes the reporting relationships as well as any procedures for setting
milestones in the development process.
The process and technology category encompasses the choice of a production process and the level
of automation. The product-process matrix, to be discussed in Chapter 2, is a useful framework
for analyzing process choices. Decisions about implementing new process technology are included
here as well.
Human resources involves the selection, promotion, placement, reward, and motivation of the
people that make the business work.
Inventory management encompasses decisions regarding purchasing, distribution, and logistics,
and speciﬁcally addresses when and how much to order. This management lever is the topic of
Chapters 4 through 11, although Chapter 6 alone provides a comprehensive discussion of the
issues involved.
Finally, production planning and scheduling focuses on systems for controlling and planning pro-
duction. Chapters 13 through 16 deal with speciﬁc production planning and scheduling decisions
and systems.
1.4.4 General Comments
We conclude this section with several general comments. First, researchers and practitioners
are continually introducing new approaches addressing some important aspect of management.
Inventory management and production planning and scheduling methods that would have been
considered impossible just a few years ago are commonplace today. The revolution in information
technology and computer networking allows members of a supply chain to have access to manufac-
turers and to track consumer demand on a daily basis, and thereby more closely match production
with demand. Many of these new approaches fall under the board area now widely known as supply
chain management. The supply chain lever, of course, pertains to supply chain management, but
so do inventory management (as we shall see in Chapters 11 and 12), production planning and
scheduling, vertical integration, and new products. Occasionally it is necessary to introduce a new
lever to focus attention on the important issues, but other times, the existing levers adequately
serve the purpose. Even with new supply chain initiatives, however, inventory management and
production planning and scheduling continue to be a headache for many managers. Evidence sug-
gests that even though a massive amount of real-time data is available, many ﬁrms do not use it,
either because they are overwhelmed with data, or because they do not know what to do with it.
Although real-time information can signiﬁcantly reduce the demand variability a ﬁrm observes,
signiﬁcant variability and the associated problems usually remain. Managers must understand the
value of the information, and they must choose inventory policies and production planning and
scheduling systems that are appropriate for their situations. One of our primary goals in this book

The Importance of Inventory Management
■
17
is to communicate the basic principles and procedures in this ﬁeld so that managers, consultants,
and analysts can provide insight and value to their ﬁrms in this dynamic world.
Second, as a ﬁrm audits its manufacturing strategy, it is important to recognize that the policies
in place for each of the 10 levers should be consistent not only with the operations objectives,
but also among themselves. If there are inconsistencies, the ﬁrm should initiate action programs to
mitigate any negative eﬀects. For instance, many companies historically pursued quality improve-
ment programs without changing worker incentives. Workers were rewarded for the volume of
their output, without regard for quality. In other words, the quality objectives and policies were
inconsistent with the human resources policies. Reward systems had to be rearranged to ﬁt with
the quality goals. Likewise, as we discuss inventory management and production planning and
scheduling in great depth throughout the remainder of this book, keep in mind the relationship
of these management levers to the other eight, and to the operations objectives. Extensive eﬀort to
reduce inventory cost may not be warranted, for instance, if the ﬁrm can charge a premium price
and really needs to focus on ﬂexibility. In a similar vein, customer service levels, which will be dis-
cussed in Chapter 6, should be established with clear knowledge of the cost and delivery objectives.
These issues will be developed further in Chapter 13.
Finally, in the process of auditing a manufacturing strategy, managers should understand
distinctive competencies at the detailed level of the management levers. These distinctive com-
petencies should inﬂuence the objectives, mission, and business strategy. Thus, information ﬂows
both ways, from business strategy to management levers and from levers to business strategy.
1.5 Measures of Effectiveness for Inventory Management and
Production Planning and Scheduling Decisions
Analysts in the production/inventory area have tended to concentrate on a single quantiﬁable mea-
sure of eﬀectiveness, such as cost, sometimes recognizing certain constraints, such as limited space,
desired customer service, and so forth. In actual fact, of course, the impact of decisions is not
restricted to a single measure of eﬀectiveness. The appropriate measures of eﬀectiveness should
relate back to the underlying objectives of management. Unfortunately, some of the following
objectives are very diﬃcult to quantify:
1. Minimizing political conﬂicts (in terms of the competing interests) within the organization.
2. Maintaining a high level of ﬂexibility to cope with an uncertain future.
3. Maximizing the chance of survival of the ﬁrm or the individual manager’s position within
the organization.
4. Keeping at an acceptable level the amount of human eﬀort expended in the planning and
operation of a decision system.
Moreover, as will be discussed in Chapter 2, even some of the more tangible cost factors are
very diﬃcult to estimate in practice.
From the perspective of top management, the measures of eﬀectiveness must be aggregate in
nature. Management is concerned with overall inventory levels and customer service levels (by
broad classes of items) as opposed to, for example, minimization of costs on an individual item
basis. Furthermore, rather than optimization in the absolute sense, a more appealing justiﬁcation
for a new or modiﬁed decision system is that it simply provides signiﬁcant improvements (in terms
of one or more measures of eﬀectiveness) over an existing system.

18
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
One other complexity is that certain decisions in inventory management and production plan-
ning and scheduling should not necessarily be made in isolation from decisions in other areas.
As an illustration, both Schwarz (1981) and Wagner (1974) point out that there are impor-
tant interactions between the design of a physical distribution system (e.g., the number, nature,
and location of warehouses) and the selection of an appropriate inventory management system.
(Chapter 11 will deal further with this particular issue.) Other researchers address another type of
interaction, namely, between transportation (shipping) decisions and those of inventory manage-
ment. (See Ernst and Pyke 1993; Henig et al. 1997.) Another interaction, vividly portrayed by
the success of Japanese management systems, is between inventory management and quality assur-
ance. Finally, interactions between pricing and inventory decisions have generated much interest in
research and in practice. (See Chan et al. 2004; Fleischmann et al. 2004; Chen and Chen 2015).
In this book, we do not develop mathematical models that directly deal with these large-scale
interactive problems. However, in several places, further descriptive advice and references will be
presented.
1.6 Summary
In this chapter, we have examined a number of strategic issues related to inventory management
and production planning and scheduling. In much of the remainder of the book, our attention
will be focused on speciﬁc issues of how best to design and operate an inventory management
and production planning and scheduling decision system for a speciﬁc organizational context.
Nevertheless, it is important not to lose sight of the broader perspective of this chapter.

Blood is collected for medical purposes at various sites (such as mobile units), tested,
separated into components, and shipped to a hospital blood bank. Each bank holds the
components in inventory and issues them as needed to satisfy transfusion requests. There
are eight major types of blood and each type has many components (such as red cells, white
cells, and plasma). Each component has a diﬀerent medical purpose and a diﬀerent lifetime.
For example, the lifetime for white cells is only 6 hours, but the lifetime for red cells is now
42 days. What type of management issues are involved in this particular type of inventory
management situation? (Discuss from strategic, tactical, and operational perspectives.) Does
perishability require diﬀerent records than for other situations? How?

Chapter 2
Frameworks for Inventory
Management and Production
Planning and Scheduling
In this chapter, we ﬁrst discuss, in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, the complexity of inventory management
and production planning and scheduling decisions (even without considering interactions with
other functional areas, as outlined in Section 1.3 of Chapter 1). Then, in Sections 2.3 through 2.5,
we present various aids for coping with the complexity. Section 2.6 discusses costs and other rele-
vant variables. Sections 2.7 and 2.8 provide some suggestions concerning the use of mathematical
models. Sections 2.9 and 2.10 are concerned with two very diﬀerent approaches for estimating
relevant cost factors identiﬁed earlier in the chapter. Finally, Section 2.11 provides a detailed look
at the process of a major study of inventory management or production planning and scheduling
systems.
2.1 The Diversity of Stock-Keeping Units
Some large manufacturing companies and military organizations stock over 500,000 distinct items
in inventory. Large distributors and retailers, such as department stores, carry about 100,000 goods
for sale. A typical medium-sized manufacturing concern keeps in inventory approximately 10,000
types of raw materials, parts, and ﬁnished goods.
Items produced and held in inventory can diﬀer in many ways. They may diﬀer in cost,
weight, volume, color, or physical shape. Units may be stored in crates, in barrels, on pallets, in
cardboard boxes, or loose on shelves. They may be packaged by the thousands or singly. They
may be perishable because of deterioration over time, perishable through theft and pilferage,
or subject to obsolescence because of style or technology. Some items are stored in dust-proof,
temperature-controlled rooms, while others can lie in mud, exposed to the elements.
Demand for items also can occur in many ways. Items may be withdrawn from inventory by
the thousands, by the dozen, or unit by unit. They may be substitutes for each other, so that, if one
item is out of stock, the user may be willing to accept another. Items can also be complements; that
23

24
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
is, customers will not accept one item unless another is also available. Units could be picked up by
a customer, or they may have to be delivered by company-owned vehicles or shipped by rail, boat,
airplane, or truck. Some customers are willing to wait for certain types of products; others expect
immediate service on demand. Many customers will order more than one type of product on each
purchase order submitted.
Goods also arrive for inventory by a variety of modes and in quantities that can diﬀer from how
they will eventually be demanded. Some goods arrive damaged; others diﬀer in number or kind
from that which was requisitioned (from a supplier or from an in-house production operation).
Some items are unavailable because of strikes or other diﬃculties in-house or at a supplier’s plant.
Delivery of an order may take hours, weeks, or even months, and the delivery time may or may
not be known in advance.
Decision making in production, inventory, and supply chain management is therefore basically
a problem of coping with large numbers and with a diversity of factors external and internal to the
organization. Given that a speciﬁc item is to be stocked at a particular location, three basic issues
must be resolved:
1. How often the inventory status should be determined
2. When a replenishment order should be placed
3. How large the replenishment order should be
Moreover, the detailed daily individual item decisions must, in the aggregate, be consistent with
the overall objectives of management.
2.2 The Bounded Rationality of a Human Being
An inescapable fact alluded to in the ﬁrst chapter was the need to view the inventory management
and production planning and scheduling problems from a systems standpoint. Before we plunge
into a detailed discussion of the possible solutions to the problem as we have posed it, let us consider
explicitly and realistically our expectations regarding the nature of the results we seek.
Simon (1957, pp. 196–206) has pointed out that all decision makers approach complex prob-
lems with a framework or model that simpliﬁes the real situation. A human being’s brain is simply
incapable of absorbing and rationalizing all of the many relevant factors in a complex decision
situation. A decision maker cannot eﬀectively conceive of the totality of a large system without
assistance. All decision makers are forced to ignore some relevant aspects of a complex problem
and base their decisions on a smaller number of carefully selected factors. These selected factors
always reﬂect decision makers’ personal biases, abilities, and perceptions of the realities they think
they face, as well as the decision technology that is available to them at any point in time.
The decisions of inventory management and production planning and scheduling are complex.
They extend beyond the intuitive powers of most decision makers because of the many intercon-
nected systems, both physical and conceptual, that have to be coordinated, rationalized, adapted to,
or controlled. The decisions must be viewed simultaneously from the point of view of the individ-
ual item in its relation to other similar items, the total aggregate inventory investment, the master
plan of the organization, the production–distribution systems of suppliers and customers, and the
economy as a whole.
The challenge is therefore twofold. Since a decision maker’s ability to cope with diversity is
limited, decision systems and rules must be designed to help expand the bounds put upon that

Frameworks for Inventory Management and Production Planning
■
25
individual’s ability to rationalize. However, because most decision makers probably have already
developed personalized approaches to the inventory/production decision, decision systems have
to be designed, and their use advocated, in the context of existing resources and managerial
capabilities.
Inventory management and production planning and scheduling as practiced today, like the
practice of accounting, because of the predominance of numerical data and a relatively long his-
tory, are mixtures of economically sound theory, accepted industrial practices, tested personalized
approaches, and outright fallacies. A goal of this book is to inﬂuence the amount of sound the-
ory that actually gets used, while trying to clarify existing fallacies. However, one must accept the
fact that existing theory is, and will be, for some time to come, insuﬃcient to do the whole job.
There will always be room for personalized, tested-in-practice, approaches to ﬁll the gaps in theory.
Therefore, within this book, we in eﬀect weave our own brand of personalized approaches with
theory. This is why, from an intellectual point of view, we ﬁnd inventory and production decisions
both challenging and exciting.
2.3 Decision Aids for Managing Diverse Individual Items
The managerial aids are basically of two kinds, conceptual and physical.
2.3.1 Conceptual Aids
The following is a partial list of conceptual aids for decision making:
1. Decisions in an organization can be considered as a hierarchy—extending from long-range
strategic planning, through medium-range tactical planning, to short-range operational con-
trol. Typically, diﬀerent levels of management deal with the three classes of decisions. We
have more to say about such a hierarchy, speciﬁcally related to production situations, in
Chapter 13.
2. A related type of hierarchy can be conceptualized with respect to decision making in inven-
tory management and production planning and scheduling. At the highest level, one chooses
a particular type (or types) of control system(s). At the next level, one selects the values of spe-
ciﬁc parameters within a chosen system (e.g., the desired level of customer service). Finally,
one operationalizes the system, including data collection, calculations, reporting of results,
and so forth (Brown 1982).
3. The large number of physical units of inventory can be classiﬁed into a smaller number of
relatively homogeneous organizational categories. Managers then manage inventories in the
context of this smaller number of decision classiﬁcations (to be discussed in Section 2.4).
4. The complexity of production planning and inventory management decisions can be reduced
by identifying, through analysis and empirical research, only the most important variables for
explicit consideration (e.g., ordering costs and demand rates). This is an especially important
essence of the operational theory we expound in this book.
2.3.2 Physical Aids
Primary physical decision aids include the following:

26
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
1. First, and foremost, decision makers can employ spreadsheets and other computer programs.
Throughout this book, we comment on how spreadsheets can be used to compute many of
the formulas presented; and we ask the reader to develop his or her own spreadsheets in many
of the end-of-chapter problems. Occasionally, we note that the algorithms are too diﬃcult
for simple spreadsheet implementation and suggest the use of other computer programs. In
either case, the computer can handle vast amounts of data faster than the manager could
ever dream of doing manually. The American Production and Inventory Control Society
(APICS) publishes a magazine (APICS—The Performance Advantage) that regularly reviews
relevant software.
2. A decision maker’s physical span of control can also be expanded by harnessing the principle
of management by exception. Decision rules are used within the computer system that focus
the attention of the decision maker only on unusual or important events.
2.4 Frameworks for Inventory Management
In this section, we present several frameworks designed to help reduce the complexity of managing
thousands of items.
2.4.1 Functional Classifications of Inventories
We recommend six broad decision categories for controlling aggregate inventories: cycle stock, con-
gestion stock, safety (or buﬀer) stock, anticipation inventories, pipeline inventories, and decoupling
stock. In our opinion, senior management can and must express an opinion on how much aggre-
gate inventory is required in each of these broad categories. While we cannot expect that such
opinions will always be in the form of clear-cut, simple answers, the categorization helps managers
view inventories as being controllable rather than as an ill-deﬁned evil to be avoided at all costs.
Cycle inventories result from an attempt to order or produce in batches instead of one unit at a
time. The amount of inventory on hand, at any point, that results from these batches is called cycle
stock. The reasons for batch replenishments include (1) economies of scale (because of large setup
costs), (2) quantity discounts in purchase price or freight cost, and (3) technological restrictions
such as the ﬁxed size of a processing tank in a chemical process. The amount of cycle stock on
hand at any time depends directly on how frequently orders are placed. As we will see, this can be
determined in part by senior management who can specify the desired trade-oﬀbetween the cost
of ordering and the cost of having cycle stock on hand. A major consideration in Chapters 4, 5, 7,
and 10 will be the determination of appropriate cycle stocks.
Congestion stocks are inventories due to items competing for limited capacity. When multiple
items share the same production equipment, particularly when there are signiﬁcant setup times,
inventories of these items build up as they wait for the equipment to become available. Chapter 16
will discuss congestion stocks in some depth.
Safety stock is the amount of inventory kept on hand, on the average, to allow for the uncertainty
of demand and the uncertainty of supply in the short run. Safety stocks are not needed when the
future rate of demand and the length of time it takes to get complete delivery of an order are known
with certainty. The level of safety stock is controllable in the sense that this investment is directly
related to the desired level of customer service (i.e., how often customer demand is met from
stock). The determination of safety stock levels in response to prespeciﬁed managerial measures of
customer service will be discussed in Chapters 6 through 11.

Anticipation inventory consists of stock accumulated in advance of an expected peak in sales.
When demand is regularly lower than average during some parts of the year, excess inventory (above
cycle and safety stock) can be built up so that, during the period of high anticipated requirements,
extra demand can be serviced from stock rather than from, for example, working overtime in the
plant. That is, the aggregate production rate can be stabilized through the use of anticipatory stock.
Anticipation stock can also occur because of seasonality of supply. For example, tomatoes, which
ripen during a rather short period, are processed into ketchup that is sold throughout the year.
Likewise, climatic conditions, such as in the Arctic, can cause shipments to be restricted to certain
times of the year. Anticipation stocks can also consist of inventories built up to deal with labor
strikes, war crises, or any other events that are expected to result in a period of time during which
the rate of supply is likely to be lower than the rate of demand. Chapter 14 will deal with the
rational determination of anticipation inventories as a part of production planning.
Pipeline (or WIP) inventories include goods in transit (e.g., in physical pipelines, on trucks,
or in railway cars) between levels of a multiechelon distribution system or between adjacent work
stations in a factory. The pipeline inventory of an item between two adjacent locations is propor-
tional to the usage rate of the item and to the transit time between the locations. Land’s End,
Dell Computer, and other direct-mail ﬁrms have negligible pipeline inventory in the distribution
system because they deliver directly to the consumer. Pipeline inventories will be considered in
Chapters 11, 15, and 16.
Decoupling stock is used in a multiechelon situation to permit the separation of decision making
at the diﬀerent echelons. For example, decoupling inventory allows decentralized decision making
at branch warehouses without every decision at a branch having an immediate impact on, say,
the central warehouse or factory. In this light, Zipkin (1995) notes that inventory is a “boundary”
phenomenon. Large amounts of inventory tend to exist between ﬁrms, or between divisions within
a ﬁrm. As these inventory levels are reduced in an attempt to reduce costs, inventory managers
must take into account the larger system of suppliers and customers throughout the supply chain.
The topics of multiechelon inventory management and supply chain management (to be discussed
in Chapters 11 and 12) attempt to capture some of these system-wide eﬀects and manage them
eﬀectively. As we dig deeply into the fundamental principles and formulas, it is essential to keep
in mind the upstream and downstream eﬀects of our decisions. Chapter 16 will include discussion
related to decoupling stocks.
Note that our six functional categories were deﬁned in order to concentrate attention on the
organizational purposes of the inventories, especially with regard to control and manageability,
rather than on accounting measures (e.g., raw materials, supplies, ﬁnished components, etc.). Most
managers are intuitively aware of the functions that inventories in each of the six categories must
play. Some of the beneﬁts (and costs) may even be measured by existing cost-accounting systems.
However, most accounting systems do not keep track of opportunity costs, such as customer disser-
vice through lost sales or the cost of extra paperwork generated by an order that must be expedited
to meet an unexpected emergency.
While it will not always be possible to precisely measure the costs and beneﬁts of each subgroup
of inventories, over the years, many experienced managers have garnered a sense of perspective
regarding the eﬀect of reducing or increasing the amount of inventory investment allocated to each
of these six categories. One of our goals in this book is the development of procedures to harness
this experience, along with measurable costs and beneﬁts and analytical techniques, to yield better
decisions from an overall systems viewpoint.
It is quite possible that an individual manager may not have had suﬃcient experience to have
developed an intuitive feel for the six functional categories that we have deﬁned above. This could

28
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
especially be true in large organizations. In such cases, instead of classifying a company’s total
aggregate inventory investment, it may be more meaningful for a manager to deal with a smaller
inventory investment, such as that of one division or strategic business unit.
Meaningful functional groupings do vary from organization to organization. But, from a
theoretical and practical viewpoint, at some point, the six functional categories—cycle stock,
congestion, safety, anticipation, pipeline, and decoupling stocks—need to be analyzed from a
cost–beneﬁt standpoint to provide an aggregate perspective for the control of individual items.
2.4.2 The A–B–C Classification as a Basis for Designing Individual Item
Decision Models
Managerial decisions regarding inventories must ultimately be made at the level of an individ-
ual item or product. The speciﬁc unit of stock to be controlled will be called a stock-keeping unit
(or SKU), where an SKU will be deﬁned as an item of stock that is completely speciﬁed as to func-
tion, style, size, color, and, often, location. For example, the same-style shoes in two diﬀerent sizes
would constitute two diﬀerent SKUs. Each combination of size and grade of steel rod in raw stock
constitutes a separate SKU. An oil company must regard each segregation of crude as a separate
SKU. A tire manufacturer would normally treat the exact same tire at two geographically remote
locations as two distinct SKUs. Note that this classiﬁcation system can result in the demand for
two SKUs being highly correlated in practice, because a certain portion of customers will always
be willing to substitute, say, a blue jacket for the one that is red.* As we will see, particularly in
Chapters 10, 11, and 15, decision rules often must coordinate a number of distinct SKUs.
Close examination of a large number of actual multi-SKU inventory systems has revealed a
useful statistical regularity in the usage rates of diﬀerent items. (We deliberately use the broader-
term usage, rather than demand, to encompass supplies, components, spare parts, etc.) Typically,
somewhere on the order of 20% of the SKUs account for 80% of the total annual dollar usage.
This suggests that all SKUs in a ﬁrm’s inventory should not be controlled to the same extent. Figure
2.1 illustrates the typical Distribution by Value (DBV) observed in practice.†
A DBV curve can be developed as follows: The value v, in dollars per unit, and the annual usage
(or demand) D, in speciﬁc units, of each SKU in inventory are identiﬁed. Then, the product Dv
is calculated for each SKU, and the Dv values for all SKUs are ranked in descending order starting
with the largest value, as in Table 2.1. Then, the corresponding values of the cumulative percent of
total dollar usage and the cumulative percent of the total number of SKUs in inventory are plotted
on a graph such as Figure 2.1. Experience has revealed that inventories of consumer goods will
typically show a lesser concentration in the higher-value SKUs than will an inventory of industrial
SKUs. Furthermore, empirically, it has been found that quite often the distribution of usage values
across a population of items can be adequately represented by a lognormal distribution. Therefore,
we can relatively simply estimate the aggregate eﬀects of diﬀerent inventory control policies. In the
Appendix of this chapter, we show (1) the mathematical form of the distribution, (2) its moments
(expected values of various powers of the variable), (3) a graphic procedure for testing the adequacy
* In practice, of course, one can deﬁne an SKU in other (e.g., less detailed) ways depending on the decision being
made and the level of detail at which one wants to control inventories.
† Incidentally, the same DBV concept is applicable to a wide variety of other phenomena such as the distribution
of (1) incomes within a population of individuals, (2) donation sizes among a group of donors, and so forth. It is
also very similar to the Pareto chart used in quality management. Similar methods are used in market analysis.

of the ﬁt to a given DBV, and (4) a graphic method of estimating the two parameters of the
distribution (m, the average value of Dv, and b which is a measure of the dispersion or spread of
the Dv values).*
A table, such as Table 2.1, is one of the most valuable tools for handling the diversity
of disaggregate inventories because it helps to identify the SKUs that are the most important.
These SKUs will be assigned a higher priority in the allocation of management time and ﬁnan-
cial resources in any decision system we design. It is common to use three priority ratings:
A (most important), B (intermediate in importance), and C (least important). The number of
categories appropriate for a particular company depends on its circumstances and the degree to
which it wishes to diﬀerentiate the amount of eﬀort allocated to various groupings of SKUs.
For example, one can always subdivide the DBV into further categories, such as “moderately
important,” etc., as long as the resulting categories receive diﬀerentiated treatment. A minimum
of three categories is almost always used, and we use this number to present the basic concepts
involved.
Class A items should receive the most personalized attention from management. The ﬁrst 5%–
10% of the SKUs, as ranked by the DBV analysis, are often designated for this most important class
of items although up to 20% of the SKUs can be designated as class A in some settings. Usually
these items also account for somewhere in the neighborhood of 50% or more of the total annual
dollar movement ( Dv) of the population of items under consideration. In Chapters 5, 7, 9, 10,
and 11, we discuss decision systems that are suitable for use with class A items.
* The parameter b is not the standard deviation of Dv. It is the standard deviation of the underlying normally
distributed variable, namely ln(Dv).

Class B items are of secondary importance in relation to class A. These items, because of
their Dv values or other considerations, rate a moderate but signiﬁcant amount of attention.
The largest number of SKUs fall into this category—usually more than 50% of total SKUs,
accounting for most of the remaining 50% of the annual dollar usage. Some books on inventory
control tend to recommend a somewhat lower portion of total SKUs for the B category. However,
because of the availability of computers, we suggest that as many SKUs as possible be monitored
and controlled by a computer-based system, with appropriate management-by-exception rules. In
Chapters 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11, we present a large number of decision systems that are suitable for
use with class B items. Some of the decision rules are also useful for controlling A items, although
in the case of A items, such rules are more apt to be overruled by managerial intervention. Further-
more, model parameters, such as costs and the estimates of demand, will be reviewed more often
for A items.
Class C items are the relatively numerous remaining SKUs that make up only a minor part of
the total dollar investment. For these SKUs, decision systems must be kept as simple as possible.
One objective of A–B–C classiﬁcation is to identify this large third group of SKUs that can poten-
tially consume a large amount of data input and managerial time. Typically, for low-value items,
most companies try to keep a relatively large number of units on hand to minimize the amount of
inconvenience that could be caused by a stockout of such insigniﬁcant parts.
For C items especially, and to a lesser degree for the others, as much grouping as possible of
SKUs into control groups based on similar annual usage rates, common suppliers, similar seasonal
patterns, same end users, common lead times, and so on, is desirable to reduce the total number
of discrete decisions that must be processed. Each control group can be designed to operate using
a single order rule and monitoring system. For example, if one SKU in the group requires an order
because of low inventories, most of the other items will also be ordered at the same time to save
on the cost of decision making. Two bin systems, because they require a minimum of paperwork,
are especially popular for controlling class C items. They will be discussed in Chapters 6 and 8.
Coordinated control systems will be presented in Chapter 10.

While Figure 2.1 is typical, the precise number of members in each of the A, B, and C categories
depends, of course, on how spread out the DBV curve actually is. For example, the greater the
spread of the distribution, the more SKUs fall into class C.
An A–B–C classiﬁcation need not be done on the basis of the DBV curve alone. Managers may
shift some SKUs among categories for a number of reasons. For example, some inexpensive SKUs
may be classiﬁed as “A” simply because they are crucial to the operation of the ﬁrm. Some large-
volume consumer distribution centers plan the allocation of warehousing space on the basis of
usage rate and cubic feet per unit. The SKUs with high usage and large cubic feet are stored closer
to the retail sales counter. Similarly a distribution by (proﬁt × volume) per SKU is sometimes
used to identify the best-selling products. Items at the lower end of such an A–B–C curve become
candidates for being discontinued. Krupp (1994) argues for a two-digit classiﬁcation, where the
ﬁrst digit is based on dollar usage as in traditional A–B–C analysis, and the second is based on
the number of customer transactions. Flores and Whybark (1987) also recommend using a two-
dimensional classiﬁcation where the ﬁrst is the traditional A–B–C and the second is based on
criticality.
In related research, Cohen and Ernst (1988) use a statistical technique called cluster analysis to
group items across many dimensions, including criticality. Reynolds (1994) provides a classiﬁca-
tion scheme, appropriate for process industries, that helps managers focus attention on important
items even if they are rarely used. Note that manufacturers and distributors often have diﬀerent
perspectives on the A–B–C classiﬁcation: An A item for one may be a C item for the other. See for
example, Lenard and Roy (1995).
2.5 A Framework for Production Planning and Scheduling
In this section, we develop an important framework, called the product-process matrix, for clas-
sifying production planning and scheduling systems. We begin by discussing the product life
cycle.
2.5.1 A Key Marketing Concept: The Product Life Cycle
The lifetime sales of many branded products reveal a typical pattern of development, as shown in
Figure 2.2. The length of this so-called life cycle appears to be governed by the rate of technological
change, the rate of market acceptance, and the ease of competitive entry.
Each year, new clothing styles are introduced in the knowledge that their whole life cycle may
last only a season (a few months). Other products, such as commercial aircraft, are expected to be
competitive for decades. Some products have been known to begin a new cycle or to revert to an
earlier stage as a result of the discovery of new uses, the appearance of new users, or the invention
of new features. Kotler (1967) cites the example of television sales, which have exhibited a history
of spurts as new sizes of screens were introduced, and the advent of color television, which put
sales back to an earlier, rapid growth stage in that industry. As high-deﬁnition television becomes
popular, and as television is blended with computers for Internet access, it is likely that sales will
spurt again. Although the life cycle is an idealized concept, three basic generalizations seem to
hold:
1. Products have a limited life. They are introduced to the market, may (or may not) pass
through a strong growth phase, and eventually decline or disappear.

32
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
2. Product proﬁts tend to follow a predictable course through the life cycle. Proﬁts are absent
in the introductory stage, tend to increase substantially in the growth stage, slow down and
then stabilize in the maturity and saturation stages, and can disappear in the decline stage.
3. Products require a diﬀerent marketing, production planning, inventory management, and
ﬁnancial strategy in each stage. The emphasis given to the diﬀerent functional areas must
also change.
When product life cycles are reasonably short, production processes must be designed to
be reusable or multipurpose in nature. Alternatively, the amount of investment in single-
purpose equipment must be recoverable before the product becomes obsolete. Moreover, the
appropriate planning and scheduling systems to use for an individual product are likely to
change as the relative importance of the item changes during its life cycle. In particular, spe-
cial control aspects for the development and decline stages of Figure 2.2 will be discussed in
Chapters 3, 5, 7, and 8.

2.5.2 Different Types of Production Processes
As one walks around diﬀerent factories and talks to factory managers, it becomes clear that there
are vast diﬀerences among diﬀerent types of production processes. In this section, we distin-
guish among four broad classes of processes—job shop, batch ﬂow, assembly line, and continuous
process—because the diﬀerences among them have important implications for the choice of the
production planning and scheduling system. Job shops typically manufacture customized products
such as printed circuit boards and certain types of metal parts. A commercial printer, which must
tailor each job to the customer’s wishes, is also an example of a job shop. Batch ﬂow processes
manufacture, for example, apparel, machine tools, and some pharmaceuticals. Assembly products
encompass, for example, automobiles, home furnishings, electrical equipment, and computers.
Typical illustrations of continuous process (also known as process, continuous ﬂow, or simply ﬂow)
products include chemicals (plastics, drugs, soaps, fertilizers, etc.), reﬁned petroleum products,
foods and beverages, and paper goods. The diﬀerences among these are vast and multidimensional.
In what follows, we draw, in particular, on the work of Taylor et al. (1981) and Schmenner (1993).
The contrast in product and market characteristics can be seen in Table 2.2. We highlight just
a few points, but we encourage the reader to examine the table in detail. Because of the more
standardized nature of products in the process industries, there tends to be more production to
stock. Assembly lines can make-to-stock or assemble-to-order, whereas job shops usually make-to-
order. Batch ﬂow processes can either make-to-order or make-to-stock depending on the products
and customers.
Process industries tend to be the most capital intensive of the four, due to higher levels of
automation. Also, process industries tend to have a ﬂow-type layout that is clear but inﬂexible. That
is, materials ﬂow through various processing operations in a ﬁxed routing. However, as we move to
the left in this table, the ﬂow increasingly follows numerous, diﬀerent, and largely unconstrained
paths. The production lines in process industries tend to be dedicated to a relatively small number
of products with comparatively little ﬂexibility to change either the rate or the nature of the output.
In this environment, capacity is quite well deﬁned by the limiting (or pacing/bottleneck) operation.
Toward the left of the table, there tends to be more ﬂexibility in both the rate and output. Moreover,
both the bottleneck and the associated capacity tend to shift with the nature of the workload (which
products are being produced and in what quantities).
Because of the relatively expensive equipment and the relatively low ﬂexibility in output rate,
process industries tend to run at full capacity (i.e., 3 shifts per day, 7 days per week) when they are
operating. This and the ﬂow nature of the process necessitate highly reliable equipment, which,
in turn, normally requires substantial preventive maintenance. Such maintenance is usually carried
out when the entire operation is shut down for an extended period of time. Moreover, much longer
lead times are typically involved in changing the capacity in a process industry (partly because of
environmental concerns, but also because of the nature of the plant and equipment). Job shops
and batch ﬂow industries tend to use less-expensive equipment. Maintenance can be done on an
“as-needed” basis. Assembly lines are more ﬂexible than continuous processes, but less so than job
shops and batch ﬂow lines. Often, the equipment is very inexpensive—simply hand tools; but
sometimes automated assembly is used, which is very expensive. Maintenance policies, then, tend
to be based on the cost of the equipment.
The number of raw materials used tends to be lower in process situations as compared with
assembly; in fact, coordination of raw materials, components, and so on, as well as required labor
input, is a major concern in assembly. However, there can be more natural variability in the charac-
teristics of these raw materials in the process context (e.g., ingredients from agricultural or mineral

sources).* Job shops and batch ﬂow operations may have very few inputs as well, but this can vary
with the context.
Although there may be relatively few products run on a particular ﬂow line in the process
industries, the products do tend to group into families according to a natural sequence. An exam-
ple would be paints, where the natural sequence of changes would be from lighter to darker colors
with a major changeover (once a cycle) from the darkest to the lightest color. As a consequence,
in contrast with the other three types of processes, a major concern is ascertaining the appropriate
sequence and the time interval between consecutive cycles among the products. The relative simi-
larity of items run on the same line in process industries also makes it easier to aggregate demand
data, running hours, and so forth than is the case in the other three.
The ﬂow nature of production in the process industries leads to less WIP inventories than is
the case, for example, in job shops. This relative lack of buﬀering stock, in turn, implies a crucial
need for adequate supplies of the relatively few raw materials. However, in this case, the same line
of reasoning applies to high volume assembly lines. Job shops tend to have large amounts of WIP,
but little ﬁnished goods inventory. Without the high levels of WIP, the output of the shop may
decrease dramatically. However, because so many job shops manufacture to-order, the products are
shipped immediately upon completion, and there is little inventory of ﬁnished goods.
Finally, note the operations challenges listed in Table 2.2. Managers in job shops focus on labor
and machine utilization and breaking bottlenecks, because the shifting bottlenecks can idle people
and equipment. A severe bottleneck can, at certain times, delay shipment of critical customer
orders. Batch ﬂow managers focus on balancing stages of production, often because there is a single
bottleneck with which other work centers must coordinate. Staﬃng and line balancing are major
concerns in assembly operations. Output tends to be very high, and diﬀerent operations highly
synchronized, so that small changes in the allocation of work to diﬀerent stations on the line can
have a signiﬁcant impact on proﬁtability. However, assembly line work is tedious, and managers
ﬁnd that they must focus on issues of worker morale. Finally, as is clear from the descriptions of
process industries, managers in these industries must keep equipment running with a minimum of
downtime.
2.5.3 The Product-Process Matrix
Recall that we are striving to divide production situations into classes that require somewhat diﬀer-
ent strategies and procedures for planning and scheduling. The product life cycle and the process
characteristics are major aids in that direction. However, Hayes and Wheelwright (1979a,b) present
a concept that provides us with considerable further insight. They point out that while the product
life cycle is a useful framework, it focuses only on marketing. They suggest that many manufac-
turing processes go through a cycle of evolution, sometimes called the process cycle, beginning
with job shops, making few-of-a-kind products, that are labor intensive and generally not very
cost eﬃcient, and moving to continuous processes, which are less ﬂexible, automated, and capital

not be considered separately. One cannot proceed from one level of mechanization to another, for
* Thompson 1988 notes that it is diﬃcult to deﬁne a “unit” in process industries, so that on-hand ﬁgures in an
automated inventory system may be wrong. The product diﬀers by grade of material, potency, and quality spec-
iﬁcations. Therefore, adjustments in traditional inventory-recording systems are necessary, including recording
shelf life, date of receipt, and expiration date.

example, without making some adjustments to the products and management decision systems
involved. Nor can new products be added or others discontinued without considering the eﬀect on
the production process.
Hayes and Wheelwright encapsulate the above remarks into a graphical representation known
as a product-process matrix. Rather than showing their original form of the matrix, we have por-
trayed in Figure 2.3 an adapted version (based partly on suggestions in Schmenner (1993), and
Taylor et al. (1981)) that is more suitable for our purposes. The columns of the matrix represent
the product life cycle phases, going from the great variety associated with startup products on the
left-hand side, to standardized commodity products on the right-hand side. The rows represent the
major types of production processes. Note that we have now divided assembly into worker-paced
and machine-paced ﬂow.*
A number of illustrations are shown in the ﬁgure. We see that, by and large, fabrication is in
the top-left corner, process industries toward the bottom-right corner, and assembly in the middle.
However, there are some exceptions. For example, drugs and specialty chemicals, which are often
thought of as process industry products, are centrally located because they are produced in batch
ﬂow lines. Likewise, steel products are toward the bottom right, even though they require some
fabrication.
* Spencer and Cox (1995) take a slightly diﬀerent angle on the product-process matrix, deﬁning the vertical axis
as the “volume of available capacity devoted to the product line.” At the top of this axis, where we have placed
job shops, this value is low, whereas for continuous processes, the value is high. Repetitive manufacturing is
then placed between batch and continuous, and is deﬁned as “the production of discrete units in high volume
concentration of available capacity using ﬁxed routings." See also Silver (1996).

Hayes and Wheelwright discuss the strategic implications of nondiagonal positions. Operating
in the top-right corner of the matrix can lead to high opportunity costs because the ﬁrm is attempt-
ing to meet high market demand with a process ﬂow that is designed for low-volume ﬂexibility.
The result should be high levels of lost sales. Operating in the lower-left corner can lead to high
out-of-pocket costs because the ﬁrm has invested in expensive production equipment that is rarely
utilized because market demand is low. See also Saﬁzadeh et al. (1996) who survey 144 managers
and discover that most factories actually do operate close to the diagonal, and those that do not
tend to exhibit poor performance.
To provide additional insight, we draw on the work of Schonberger (1983) who points out that
the strategy for production planning and scheduling should depend on how easily one can associate
raw material and part requirements with the schedule of end products. As we will now show, there
is a direct connection between the position on the product-process matrix and the ease of the
this association. In the lower right-hand corner of Figure 2.3, the association tends to be quite
easy (continuous process systems). This position is, by and large, occupied by capacity-oriented
process industries. As we move up to the left and pass through high-volume assembly into lower-
volume assembly and batch ﬂow, the association becomes increasingly diﬃcult. In this region, one
is dealing primarily with materials and labor-oriented fabrication and assembly industries. Finally,
in the top left-hand corner, where fabrication is dominant, the association may again become
easier but, because production here is primarily make-to-order, detailed, advanced planning and
scheduling are like usually not feasible.
Based on these comments, and others in this section, we can introduce diﬀerent production
planning and scheduling systems that are appropriate for ﬁrms located at various positions on the
product-process matrix. Because we deal with these systems in depth later in the book, we simply
note where they will be discussed. See Figure 2.4 and Table 2.3, where we brieﬂy describe the
primary focus of each system.

Finally, we note that advanced production technology can allow a ﬁrm to move oﬀthe diagonal
and still be proﬁtable. Flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) achieve ﬂexible, low-volume produc-
tion with the eﬃciency of high-volume systems. Automated setups allow rapid changeovers among
diﬀerent products, and computer-controlled machining allows for eﬃcient production. Thus, it is
possible to operate proﬁtably to the lower left of the diagonal.
2.6 Costs and Other Important Factors
Through empirical studies and deductive mathematical modeling, a number of factors have been
identiﬁed that are important for inventory management and production planning and scheduling
decisions.
2.6.1 Cost Factors
Here, we brieﬂy describe a number of cost factors. Sections 2.9 and 2.10 will be concerned with
estimating their values. The discussion of one other type of cost, the cost of changing the aggre-
gate production rate, or work force size, will be left until Chapter 14 where, for the ﬁrst time,
we deal with medium-range aggregate production-planning problems in which such costs are
relevant.

2.6.1.1 The Unit Value or Unit Variable Cost, v
The unit value (denoted by the symbol v) of an item is expressed in dollars per unit. For a merchant*
it is simply the price (including freight) paid to the supplier, plus any cost incurred to make it ready
for sale. It can depend, via quantity discounts, on the size of the replenishment. For producers, the
unit value of an item is usually more diﬃcult to determine. However, one thing is certain; it is
seldom the conventional accounting or “book value” assigned in most organizations. The value of
an item ideally should measure the actual amount of money (variable cost) that has been spent on
the SKU to make it available for usage (either for fulﬁlling customer demand or for internal usage
as a component of some other items). As we will see in Section 2.9, the determination of v is not
an easy task. Nevertheless, we shall also see that most models we present are relatively robust to
errors in cost estimation. A good starting point is the cost ﬁgure given by accounting, adjusted for
obvious errors.
As an example, a small retailer buys ski hats for $20, and then hires a high-school student to
unpack them and put them on the shelves. The cost per unit of the student’s time is $1, so that the
value of v should be $21. A second example is a manufacturer whose cost-accounting system shows
that an item costs $4.32 per unit to manufacture. Upon further examination, however, it is clear
that this item is particularly diﬃcult to manufacture, and that a production supervisor devotes up
to 30% of her time overseeing the process. The true cost of the item should reﬂect the value of the
supervisor’s time. At 30% of a $40,000 salary, and 25,000 units produced per year, the cost of the
item should be increased by ($40, 000)(0.30)/(25, 000 units) = $0.48 per unit.
The unit value is important for two reasons. First, the total acquisition (or production) costs
per year clearly depend on its value. Second, the cost of carrying an item in inventory depends
on v.
2.6.1.2 The Cost of Carrying Items in Inventory
The cost of carrying items in inventory includes the opportunity cost of the money invested, the
expenses incurred in running a warehouse, handling and counting costs, the costs of special storage
requirements, deterioration of stock, damage, theft, obsolescence, insurance, and taxes. The most
common convention of costing is to use
Carrying costs per year = ¯Ivr
(2.1)
where ¯I is the average inventory in units (hence ¯Iv is the average inventory expressed in dollars),
and r is the carrying charge, the cost in dollars of carrying one dollar of inventory for 1 year.
By far, the largest portion of the carrying charge is made up of the opportunity costs of the
capital tied up that otherwise could be used elsewhere in an organization and the opportunity
costs of warehouse space claimed by inventories. Neither of these costs are measured by traditional
accounting systems.
The opportunity cost of capital can be deﬁned easily enough. It is, theoretically speaking, the
ROI that could be earned on the next most attractive opportunity that cannot be taken advantage
of because of a decision to invest the available funds in inventories. Unfortunately, such a marginal
cost concept is diﬃcult to implement in practice. For one thing, the next most attractive investment
opportunity can change from day to day. Does this mean that the cost of the capital portion of
* We use the term merchant to denote a nonproducer.

42
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
carrying should also be changed from day to day? From a theoretical point of view, the answer
is yes. In fact, one should theoretically account for the time value of money (a topic we discuss
in Chapter 4).* In practice, such factors are diﬃcult to administer; instead, the cost of capital is
set at some level by decree and is changed only if major changes have taken place in a company’s
environment. For example, after due consideration by senior management, a policy is declared that
“only investments which expect to earn more than a speciﬁed percent can be implemented.” The
cost of capital used, of course, has to depend on the degree of risk inherent in an investment. (For
the same reason, banks charge a higher rate of interest on second mortgages than on the ﬁrst.) As
a result, in practice, the opportunity cost of capital can range from the bank’s prime lending rate
to 50% and higher. Small companies often have to pay the higher rate because they suﬀer from
severe capital shortages and they lack the collateral to attract additional sources of working capital.
A further complication is that inventories are often ﬁnanced from a mix of sources of funds, each
of which may have a diﬀerent rate. The true cost of carrying the inventory should be based on a
weighted average of these rates.
Inventory investment, at least in total, is usually considered to be of relatively low risk because
in most cases, it can be converted into cash relatively quickly. However, the degree of risk inherent
in inventory investment varies from organization to organization, and the inventory investment
itself can change the ﬁrm’s level of risk (Singhal 1988; Singhal and Raturi 1990; Singhal et al.
1994). Some of the most important impediments to quick conversion to cash can be obsolescence,
deterioration, pilferage, and the lack of immediate demand at the normal price. Each of these
factors increases the cost of capital over and above the prime rate because of a possible lack of
opportunity of quick cash conversion.
The value of r is not only dependent on the relative riskiness of the SKUs, it also depends on the
costs of storage that are a function of bulkiness, weight, special handling requirements, insurance,
and possibly taxes. Such detailed analysis is seldom applied to all SKUs in inventory. To make the
inventory decision more manageable both from a theoretical and a practical point of view, a single
value of r is usually assumed to apply for most items. Note from Equation 2.1 that this assumes
that more expensive items are apt to be riskier to carry and more expensive to handle or store. Such
a convenient relationship doesn’t always hold true for all SKUs.† Note again that r itself could
depend on the total size of the inventory; for example, r would increase if a company had to begin
using outside warehousing.
As an example, imagine a company that can borrow money from the bank at 12%. Recent
investment opportunities, however, suggest that money available to the ﬁrm could earn in the
neighborhood of 18%. The value of r should be based on the latter ﬁgure, perhaps inﬂated for the
other reasons noted above, because the opportunity cost of the money tied up in inventory is 18%.
2.6.1.3 The Ordering or Setup Cost, A
The symbol A denotes the ﬁxed cost (independent of the size of the replenishment) associated with
a replenishment. For a merchant, it is called an ordering cost and it includes the cost of order
* The time value of money asserts that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future because it can earn
a return in the interim.

of ¯I(vr + h).

forms, postage, telephone calls, authorization,* typing of orders, receiving, (possibly) inspection,
following up on unexpected situations, and handling of vendor invoices. The production setup
cost includes many of these components and other costs related to interrupted production. For
example, we might include the wages of a skilled mechanic who has to adjust the production
equipment for this part. Then, once a setup is completed, there often follows a period of time
during which the facility is produced at lower quality or slower speed while the equipment is ﬁne
tuned and the operator adjusts to the new part. This is normally called the “learning eﬀect” and the
resulting costs are considered to be part of the setup cost because they are the result of a decision to
place an order.† Finally, notice that during the setup and learning period, opportunity costs are, in
eﬀect, incurred because production time on the equipment is being lost during which some other
item could be manufactured. Hence, the latter opportunity cost is only incurred if the production
facility in question is being operated at capacity.
Several of these factors can become quite complicated. Consider for a moment the wages of the
skilled mechanic who performs the setup. If this person is paid only when setting up a machine,
the wages are clearly a part of the setup cost. What happens, however, if the person is on salary, so
that whether or not the machine is set up, the wages are still paid? Should these wages be a part
of the setup cost? The answer is the subject of much debate in operations and cost accounting.
Our answer is that it depends on the use of the mechanic’s time when he is not setting up the
machine, and on whether a long-term or short-term perspective is taken. If he would be involved
in other activities, including setting up other machines, when he is not setting up the machine for
this part, the cost should be included. In other words, there is an opportunity cost for his time.
Most factories we have visited are in this situation. People are busy; when they are not working on
a particular setup, they are working on other things. There is another side to the story, however. If
we decide not to set up the machine for this part, we do not generate actual dollar savings in the
short term. The wages are still paid. So, in the short term, the cost of the mechanic’s time is ﬁxed,
and therefore, one could argue that it should not be a part of the setup cost. Let us assume that
the mechanic’s time is used for other activities. The key then is whether a long-term or short-term
perspective is taken. A long-term view suggests that the wages should be included because in the
long term, this person could be laid oﬀ, so that the decision to set up infrequently aﬀects the money
the ﬁrm pays. (Kaplan (1988) argues that virtually all costs are variable in the long term, because
people can be ﬁred, plants closed, and so on.) A short-term view suggests that the wages should not
be included. The ﬁnal issue, then, is whether a long-term or short-term decision is being made. In
most cases, the setup cost, A, will be applied to repeated decisions over a long period of time—say
a year. We would then argue that the wages of this mechanic should be included in A. In other
words, we want to include all costs that are relevant to the decision. To borrow a phrase: “If what
you do does not aﬀect the cost, the cost should not aﬀect what you do.” This type of reasoning
also applies to many of the other factors listed in the previous paragraph. Further discussion on
this topic is in Section 2.9.
Clearly, one could spend months trying to nail down the A value precisely. Often, it is far more
beneﬁcial to change the underlying processes that determine A. For example, the widespread adop-
tion of information technology that facilitates computer-to-computer transactions has substantially
* The level of authorization may depend on the dollar size of the replenishment; for example, special authorization

lowered ﬁxed order setup costs. We shall comment further on the eﬀects of such technologies
throughout the book.
2.6.1.4 The Costs of Insufficient Capacity in the Short Run
These costs could also be called the costs of avoiding stockouts and the costs incurred when stock-
outs take place. In the case of a producer, they include the expenses that result from changing over
equipment to run emergency orders and the attendant costs of expediting, rescheduling, split lots,
and so forth. For a merchant, they include emergency shipments or substitution of a less-proﬁtable
item. All these costs can be estimated reasonably well. However, there are also costs, which are
much more nebulous, that can result from not servicing customer demand. Will the customer be
willing to wait while the item is backordered, or is the sale lost for good? How much goodwill is
lost as a result of the poor service? Will the customer ever return? Will the customer’s colleagues be
told of the disservice?* Such questions can, in principle, be answered empirically through an actual
study for only a limited number of SKUs. For most items, the risks and costs inherent in disser-
vice have to remain a matter of educated, considered opinion, not unlike the determination of the
risks inherent in carrying inventories. In Chapter 6, we examine a number of diﬀerent methods of
modeling the costs of disservice. In every case, however, it is important to explicitly consider the
customer’s perspective.
2.6.1.5 System Control Costs
System control costs are those associated with the operation of the particular decision system
selected. These include the costs of data acquisition, data storage and maintenance, and com-
putation. In addition, there are less-tangible costs of human interpretation of results, training,
alienation of employees, and so on. Although diﬃcult to quantify, this category of “costs” may be
crucial in the choice of one decision system over another.
2.6.2 Other Key Variables
Table 2.4† provides a rather extensive listing of potentially important variables. We elaborate on
just three factors.‡
2.6.2.1 Replenishment Lead Time, L
A stockout can only occur during periods when the inventory on hand is “low.” Our decision about
when an order should be placed will always be based on how low the inventory should be allowed to
be depleted before the order arrives. The idea is to place an order early enough so that the expected
number of units demanded during a replenishment lead time will not result in a stockout very
often. We deﬁne the replenishment lead time, as the time that elapses from the moment at which it

reference we know of a probabilistic inventory theory.

is decided to place an order, until it is physically on the shelf ready to satisfy customers’ demands.
The symbol L will be used to denote the replenishment lead time. It is convenient to think of the
lead time as being made up of ﬁve distinct components:*
1. Administrative time at the stocking point (order preparation time): the time that elapses from
the moment at which it is decided to place the order until it is actually transmitted from the
stocking point.
2. Transit time to the supplier: this may be negligible if the order is placed electronically or by
telephone, but transit time can be several days if a mailing system is used.
* The discussion deals speciﬁcally with the case of an external (purchased) replenishment but is also conceptually
applicable for internal (production) replenishments.

46
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
3. Time at the supplier: if L is variable, this time is responsible for most of the variability. Its
duration is materially inﬂuenced by the availability of stock at the supplier when the order
arrives.
4. Transit time back to the stocking point.
5. Time from order receipt until it is available on the shelf: this time is often wrongly neglected.
Certain activities, such as inspection and cataloging, can take a signiﬁcant amount of time.
We will see that the variability of demand over L can be the result of several causes. If demand
varies in a reasonably predictable manner depending on the time of the year, we say it is sea-
sonal. If it is essentially unpredictable, we label the variability as random. Demand over lead time
also varies because the time between ordering and receipt of goods is seldom constant. Strikes,
inclement weather, or supplier production problems can delay delivery. During periods of low
sales, lead times can turn out to be longer than expected because the supplier is accumulating
orders to take advantage of the eﬃciency of longer production runs. When sales are high, longer
lead times can result because high demand causes backlogs in the supplier’s plant. Finally, in peri-
ods of short supply, it may be impossible to acquire desired quantities of items, even after any lead
time.
2.6.2.2 Production versus Nonproduction
Decisions in a production context are inherently more complicated than those in nonproduction
situations. There are capacity constraints at work centers as well as an interdependency of demand
among ﬁnished products and their components. Gregory et al. (1983) note that the production and
inventory planning and control procedures for a ﬁrm should depend on (1) whether production
is make-to-stock or make-to-order (which, in turn, depends on the relation between customer
promise time and production lead time) and (2) whether purchasing is for known production or
anticipated production (a function of the purchasing lead time). Chapters 13 through 16 (and to
some extent, Chapters 10 and 11) will address production situations.
2.6.2.3 Demand Pattern
Besides the factors listed in Table 2.4, we mention the importance of the stage in the product life
cycle (Section 2.5.1). Diﬀerent control procedures are appropriate for new, mature, and declining
items. The nature of the item can also inﬂuence the demand pattern; for example, the demand for
spare parts is likely to be less predictable than the requirements for components of an internally
produced item.
2.7 Three Types of Modeling Strategies
Now that we have identiﬁed the costs and other key variables, we comment on three types of
modeling strategies. First, however, we wish to emphasize that the results of any mathematical
analysis must be made consistent with the overall corporate strategy (Section 1.2) and must be
tempered by the behavioral and political realities of the organization under study. In particular, a
proper problem diagnosis is often more important than the subsequent analysis (see Lockett 1981)
and, in some cases, corporate strategy and the behavioral or political circumstances may rule out
the meaningful use of any mathematical model.

Frameworks for Inventory Management and Production Planning
■
47
There are three types of strategies that involve some modelings:
1. Detailed modeling and analytic selection of the values of a limited number of decision
variables.
2. Broader-scope modeling, with less attempt at optimization.
3. Minimization of inventories with very little in the way of associated mathematical models.
2.7.1 Detailed Modeling and Analytic Selection of the Values of a
Limited Number of Decision Variables
The strategy here is to develop a mathematical model that permits the selection of the values of
a limited set of variables so that some reasonable measure of eﬀectiveness can be optimized. A
classical example (to be treated in Chapter 4) is the economic order quantity, which, under certain
assumptions, minimizes the total of ordering and inventory carrying costs per unit time. In general,
a mathematical model may permit a deductive (closed-form) solution, an iterative solution (such
as in the Simplex Method of linear programming), or a solution by some form of trial-and-error
procedure (such as in the use of a simulation model).
2.7.2 Broader-Scope Modeling with Less Optimization
Here, the strategy is to attempt to develop a more realistic model of the particular situation. How-
ever, the added realism often prevents any clearly deﬁned optimization; in fact, there may not even
be a mathematically stated objective function. One strives for a feasible solution that one hopes
will provide reasonable performance. This is the philosophy underlying Material Requirements
Planning (to be discussed in Chapters 13 and 15).
2.7.3 Minimization of Inventories with Little Modeling
Here, the strategy is to attempt to minimize inventories without the help of mathematical mod-
els. The Just-in-Time (JIT) and Optimized Production Technology (OPT) philosophies are fall
into this category. They strive for elimination of wastes (including inventories) and for continu-
ous improvement. These powerful philosophies, to be discussed in Chapter 16, have since been
supplemented with mathematical models that help managers reﬁne and explain their operation.
However, the philosophies are not grounded in models, but in an approach to doing business.
2.8 The Art of Modeling
Whichever modeling strategy is chosen, one must attempt to incorporate the important factors,
yet keep the model as simple as possible. Incorrect modeling can lead to costly, erroneous deci-
sions. As models become more elaborate, they require more managerial time, take more time
to design and maintain, are more subject to problems of personnel turnover, and require more
advocation with top management and everyone else in an organization (i.e., system control costs
are increased). There is considerable art in developing an appropriate model; thus, a completely
prescriptive approach is not possible. There are some excellent references (see, e.g., Little 1970;
Ackoﬀ1981; Hillier and Lieberman 1990; Powell 1995a,b; Powell and Batt 2011) on the general
topic of modeling. In particular, Little recommends that decision models should be understandable

48
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
to the decision maker (particularly the underlying assumptions), complete, evolutionary, easy to
control, easy to communicate with, robust (i.e., insensitive to errors in input data, etc.), and adap-
tive. We now list a number of suggestions that analysts may ﬁnd helpful in modeling complex
production/inventory situations:
1. As discussed in Chapter 1, the measures of eﬀectiveness used in a model must be consistent
with the objectives of the organization.
2. One is usually not looking for absolute optimization, but instead for signiﬁcant improve-
ments over current operations. Thus, we advocate the development and use of the so-called
heuristic decision rules. These are procedures, based on sound logic, that are designed to
yield reasonable, not necessarily mathematically optimal, answers to complex real problems
(see Zanakis 1989; Reeves 1993; Powell and Batt 2011).
3. A model should permit results to be presented in a form suitable for management review.
Therefore, results should be aggregated appropriately and displayed graphically if possible.
4. One should start with as simple a model as possible, only adding complexities as necessary.
The initial, simpler versions of the model, if nothing else, provide useful insights into the
form of the solution. We have found it helpful in multi-item problems to ﬁrst consider the
simplest cases of two items, then three items, and so on. In the same vein, it is worthwhile
to analyze the special case of a zero lead time before generalizing to a nonzero lead time.
We recall the incident of an overzealous mathematician who was employed by a consulting
ﬁrm. Given a problem to solve involving just two items, he proceeded to wipe out the study
budget by ﬁrst solving the problem for the general case of n items and then substituting
n = 2 in the very last step. In the same vein, one should introduce probabilistic elements
with extreme caution for at least three reasons: (i) the substantially increased data require-
ments, (ii) the resulting computational complexities, and, perhaps most important, (iii) the
severe conceptual diﬃculties that many practicing managers have with probabilistic reason-
ing. Throughout the book, we ﬁrst deal with deterministic situations, and then modify the
decision rules for probabilistic environments. Moreover, results are often insensitive to the
particular probability distribution used for a speciﬁc random variable having a given mean
and variance (see Section 6.7.14 of Chapter 6); thus, a mathematically convenient distribu-
tion can be used (e.g., the normal distribution described in Appendix II at the end of the
book).
5. In most cases in the book, we advocate modeling that leads to analytic decision rules that can
be implemented through the use of formulas and spreadsheets. However, particularly when
there are dynamic or sequential* eﬀects with uncertainty present (e.g., forecast errors), it may
not be possible to analytically derive (through deductive mathematical reasoning) which of
two or more alternative courses of action is best to use in a particular decision situation.
In such a case, one can turn to the use of simulation. A simulation may be used, which
still involves a model of the system. However, now, instead of using deductive mathematical
reasoning, one instead, through the model, simulates through time the behavior of the real
system under each alternative of interest. Conceptually, the approach is identical with that
of using a physical simulation model of a prototype system—for example, the use of a small-
scale hydraulic model of a series of reservoirs on a river system. More basically, prior to
* An example of a sequential eﬀect would be the following: if A occurs before B, then C results; but if B occurs
before A, then D takes place.

even considering the possible courses of action, simulation can be used to simply obtain a
better understanding of the system under study (perhaps via the development of a descriptive
analytic model of the system). References on simulation include Fishman (1978) and Kelton
and Law (2000).
6. Where it is known a priori that the solution to a problem will possess a certain property, this
information should be used, if possible, to simplify the modeling or the solution process.
For example, in many cases, a very costly event (such as a stockout) will only occur on an
infrequent basis. By neglecting these infrequent occurrences, we can simplify the modeling
and obtain a straightforward trial solution of the problem. Once this trial solution is found
of the above, the assumption is tested. If it turns out to be reasonable, as is often the case, the
trial solution becomes the ﬁnal solution. (See White 1969.)
7. When facing a new problem, one should at least attempt to show an equivalence with a
diﬀerent problem for which a solution method is already known (see Naddor 1978; Nahmias
1981).
2.9 Explicit Measurement of Costs
It often comes as a surprise to technically trained individuals that cost accountants and managers
usually cannot determine exactly the costs of some of the variables they specify in their models.
That cost measurement is, in practice, a problem that has not been conclusively solved, is evident
from the fact that a number of alternative cost-accounting systems are in use. Kaplan (1988) points
out that there are three fundamental purposes for cost-accounting systems: valuing the inventory
for ﬁnancial statements, providing feedback to production managers, and measuring the cost of
individual SKUs. The choice of a cost system should be consistent with its purpose, and many
ﬁrms should have more than one system.
One basic problem arises because it is not possible and often is not economical to trace all costs
(variable, semivariable, or ﬁxed) to each and every individual SKU in the inventory. An allocation
process that distributes, often arbitrarily, ﬁxed or overhead costs across all units is inevitable. (Recall
the discussion of the ordering cost A, in Section 2.6.1.) Rosen (1974) categorizes some of the many
possible cost systems, and we have summarized these in Table 2.2.
In Table 2.5, column 1, process costing is deﬁned as an accounting method whereby all costs
are collected by cost centers such as the paint shop, the warehouse, etc. After a predetermined
collection period, each SKU that passed through the process will get allocated a share of the total
costs incurred in the cost center. For example, all chairs painted in a particular month could be
allocated exactly the same painting cost (which could be diﬀerent the next month).
Alternatively, job order costing could be used. Under this accounting method, a particular order
for chairs would be tracked as it progressed through the shop, and all costs incurred by this partic-
ular order would be recorded. Thereby, the “cost” of producing the same chair under either of the
two costing systems could be very diﬀerent. The reason for having these two diﬀerent systems in
practice is simple. The job order costing system is more expensive in terms of the amount of book-
keeping required, but it provides information for more detailed cost control than process costing.
(Note that the accountant has to select between decision systems for collecting and keeping track
of costs just like we must design inventory/production decision systems that have the desired level
of sophistication.)
In addition to selecting between bookkeeping systems, the accountant must decide on the basis
of valuation. There are four choices listed in column 2 of Table 2.5. Under actual costing, the

product cost v is determined on the basis of accumulated actual cost directly incurred during a
given period. Materials, labor, and overhead costs are accumulated, which are and then are spread
over all units produced during the period. Note that, as a result, the cost of a given item may vary
from one period to another.
Under standard costing the materials, labor, and factory overhead are charged against each
production unit in accordance with a standard (hourly) rate regardless of how much actual eﬀort
(time) it takes. Any deﬁcit (negative variance) between total standard costs charged and actual

Frameworks for Inventory Management and Production Planning
■
51
costs incurred over a costing period (say a year) is charged as a separate expense item on the income
statement and does not end up as a part of the cost of an item, v. Alternatively, surpluses (posi-
tive variances), that is, where production takes less time than the standard, can artiﬁcially inﬂate v
unless all items produced are revalued at the end of an accounting year. The possibility of a diﬀer-
ence between standard and actual costs results from the fact that standards may have been set for
diﬀerent purposes or they may have been set at ideal, long-run, or perceived “normal” rates that
turn out, after the fact, to be unattainable. Also, existing standards may not have been adjusted to
account for process improvements and learning.
The term predetermined in Table 2.5 refers to the allocation of costs to an SKU based on
short-term budgets as opposed to engineered standards. Predetermined cost allocations are usually
somewhat arbitrary and may not reﬂect the amount of expense (as could be determined from a
careful engineering study) incurred by an SKU. Predetermined costing has the virtue of ensur-
ing that, from an accounting point of view, all costs incurred over a costing period get allocated
somewhere.
Cost-accounting systems are further diﬀerentiated in column 3 of Table 2.5 by whether they
utilize absorption costing or direct costing. Under absorption costing (also called full costing), little
distinction is made between ﬁxed and variable manufacturing costs. All overhead costs are charged
according to some formula, such as the percent of total direct labor hours used by the product
being manufactured. In spite of the fact that direct labor now represents as little as 5% of the total
product cost, many ﬁrms still allocate overhead on that basis. Activity-based costing (also denoted
by ABC) attempts to allocate the actual amount of each overhead resource spent on each SKU.
Imagine a ﬁrm that produces three products, each of which uses about the same number of direct
labor hours. Product X2Z, however, requires a signiﬁcant amount of eﬀort by supervisors, quality
assurance, and expediters because the production processes are not well suited to it. Allocation
of overhead on the basis of direct labor hours will make it appear that the other two products
are less proﬁtable than they really are; and product X2Z’s cost will include a smaller portion of
overhead than it should. Managers armed with this information may decide to drop a product that
is actually very proﬁtable, and to keep a product that actually is losing money. ABC systems have
grown in popularity because of these very issues. See also Cooper and Kaplan (1987), Shank and
Govindarajan (1988), and Karmarkar and Pitbladdo (1994).
The concept of direct costing involves the classiﬁcation of costs into ﬁxed and variable elements.
Costs that are a function of time rather than volume are classiﬁed as ﬁxed and are not charged to
individual SKUs. For example, all ﬁxed manufacturing expenses, executive and supervisory salaries,
and general oﬃce expenses are usually considered to be ﬁxed since they are not directly a function
of volume. However, note that some costs are in fact semivariable; they vary only with large ﬂuctu-
ations in volume. A doubling of the production rate, for example, could make it necessary to hire
extra supervisory personnel.
Semivariable costs (Figure 2.5) in practice are often handled by assuming that volume can be
predicted with suﬃcient accuracy so that, over a relevant range, costs can be viewed as being only
of two kinds: variable and ﬁxed. This is not always a simple matter.
It should be clear that the ﬁrst step in any attempt at explicit cost measurement has to be
a determination of what assumptions are made by the existing cost-accounting system within a
ﬁrm. As Rosen (1974) points out, a small business needing information for external reporting
and bookkeeping purposes may choose from Table 2.5 a system (one selection from each of the
three columns) that is A–A–A because it may be the least costly from a bookkeeping standpoint.
A similar company wishing to postpone tax payments may choose A–A–B, and so forth. Again, in
spite of the resistance from ﬁnancial managers, it may be desirable to use more than one system.

Semivariable costs.
Note that while the above description of costing systems provides many options, the most
important costs of all, from an inventory-planning standpoint, do not appear at all. Inventory and
production-planning decisions require the opportunity costs. These costs do not appear in conven-
tional accounting records. Accountants are primarily concerned with the recording of historical
costs, whereas decision makers must anticipate future costs so that they can be avoided if possi-
ble. Existing cost data in standard accounting records, therefore, may not be relevant to decision
making or at best have to be recast to be useful.
To a decision maker, relevant costs include those that will be incurred in the future if a particular
action is chosen. They also include costs that could be avoided if a particular action is not taken.
Therefore, the overall overhead costs are only relevant if they can be aﬀected by an inventory or
production-planning decision. Allocated (predetermined) overhead, based on some ad hoc formula
that is useful for ﬁnancial reporting purposes, generally is not relevant for our purposes. One must
therefore carefully examine the costing procedures of an organization from the point of view of
their relevancy to the decision at hand.
2.10 Implicit Cost Measurement and Exchange Curves
Suppose we examine carefully the existing accounting systems of a ﬁrm and determine the
particular species with which we are dealing. Suppose further that we modify the historical cost data
to the best of our ability to reﬂect all relevant costs (including opportunity costs). Then, ﬁnally,
suppose we use the most advanced techniques of inventory control to determine the appropriate

inventory investment, based on our adjusted costs. What if this “appropriate” total investment in
inventories that we propose turns out to be larger than the top management is willing to accept?
Two possible conclusions could be drawn. First, one could argue that we did not correctly
determine the relevant costs and that we did not properly capture the opportunity costs. Second,
one could argue that the top management is wrong. But what to do? The key lies in realizing that
the inventory-planning decision deals with the design of an entire system consisting of an ordering
function, a warehousing system, and the servicing of customer demand—all to top management
speciﬁcation. One cannot focus on an individual SKU and ask: What is the marginal cost of stock-
ing this or that individual item without considering its impact on other SKUs or on the system as
a whole? Brown (1967, pp. 29–31) argues that there is no “correct” value for r, the cost of carrying
inventories, in the explicit measurement sense used by accounting. Instead, the carrying charge r, he
says, is a top management policy variable that can be changed from time to time to meet the chang-
ing environment. The only “correct” value of r, according to Brown, is the one that results in a
total system where aggregate investment, total number of orders per year, and the overall customer-
service level are in agreement with the corporate, operations, and marketing strategy. For example,
the speciﬁcation of a low r value would generate a system with relatively large inventory invest-
ment, good customer service, and low order replenishment expenses. Alternatively, higher values of
r would encourage carrying of less inventories, poorer customer service, and higher ordering costs.
There is of course, no reason, from a theoretical point of view, why all costs (including A,
v, and the cost of disservice) could not be considered as policy variables. In practice, this is in
eﬀect what is often done, at least partially, by many inventory consultants. An attempt is ﬁrst
made to measure all costs explicitly to provide some baseline data (“ballpark” estimates). Then, the
resulting inventory decision system is modiﬁed to conform to the aggregate speciﬁcations. Only
cost estimates that achieve the aggregate speciﬁcations are ultimately used during implementation.
Such an approach is feasible in practice partly because most of the decision models for inventory
management and production planning and scheduling are relatively insensitive to errors in cost
measurement. In Chapters 4 and 6, we describe in detail a methodology called exchange curves,
for designing inventory decision systems using cost information and policy variables speciﬁed by
the top management. See also the discussion in Lenard and Roy (1995). For now, we just give a
brief overview illustration for the decision of choosing order quantities for a population of items.
For the economic order quantity decision rule (to be discussed in Chapter 4), it turns out that
the order quantity of an individual item depends on the ratio A/r. As A/r increases, the order
quantity increases; hence, the average inventory level of the item increases and the number of
replenishments per year decreases. These same general eﬀects apply for all items in the population
under consideration. Therefore, as A/r increases, the total average inventory (in dollars) increases
and the total number of replenishments per year decreases. Thus, an aggregate curve is traced as
A/r is varied (as shown in Figure 2.6). If the management selects a desired aggregate operating
point on the curve, this implies a value of A/r. The use of this A/r value in the economic order
quantity formula for each item will give the desired aggregate operating characteristics.
2.11 The Phases of a Major Study of an Inventory Management
or Production Planning and Scheduling System
We have now outlined some of the important costs and other factors for inventory and produc-
tion decisions. The ﬁnal part of this chapter describes the process of a major (internal or external)

consulting study. In this process, we strongly recommend building decision systems as a process of
organizational intervention, whereby a model builder attempts to improve on the quality of deci-
sions being made. By intervening, the consultant accepts a great responsibility—that of ensuring
that the daily routines in the client’s organization are carried on, at least as well as before, during
the period of transition to the newly designed decision procedures and thereafter. Acceptance of
such a responsibility implies that implementation considerations have to dominate all phases of
the design of an operational decision system. In particular, successfully implemented innovations
require careful planning, and once in place, they must be maintained, evaluated, and adapted, ad
inﬁnitum, through an eﬀective control and evaluation system.
A major study can be an overwhelming task. Therefore, we recommend dividing it into six
phases, based on the classic work of Morgan (1963): consideration, analysis, synthesis, choos-
ing among alternatives, control, and evaluation. See Figure 2.7. We brieﬂy present a number of
questions and issues that should be addressed in each phase.
2.11.1 Consideration
This ﬁrst phase focuses on conceptualizing the problem and covers a number of strategic and
organizational issues, as well as some detailed modeling concerns. The questions and issues include:
■What are the important operations objectives for this ﬁrm? (Recall the four objectives—
cost, quality, delivery, and ﬂexibility—discussed in Chapter 1.) In other words, one should
perform at least a brief audit of the operations strategy of the ﬁrm.
■Who has the overall responsibility for inventory management and production planning and
scheduling? Identify the capabilities and limitations of this person as they pertain to the
potential goals of the study.

■What is the organizational structure? In particular, what is the relationship between
operations and marketing?
■What are annual sales of the organization?
■What is the current average aggregate inventory level in dollars? This and the previous
question help to identify the magnitude of savings possible.
■What are the current inventory management and production planning and scheduling
procedures? How are decisions made, and by whom? Are any models used?
■What are the computer resources and skills available?
■What is the SKU? Is it a completed item, or a subassembly that will be ﬁnished to order? Are
there other alternatives to holding the ﬁnished product inventory?
■Is the inventory necessary? Perhaps, it is possible to eliminate some inventories that exist only
for historical reasons.
■What modeling strategy (from Section 2.7) seems to be appropriate? One should keep in
mind the comments in Section 2.8.
2.11.2 Analysis
The second phase is one of the two modeling stages, and focuses on data collection and a detailed
understanding of the uncontrollable and controllable variables. Uncontrollable variables are those,
such as the number of items and the level of seasonality, which the consultant or the ﬁrm can-
not easily change. Controllable variables are those quantities that can be manipulated to achieve
the goals. We provide quite a long list that can be used to trigger information gathering. (A reex-
amination of Table 2.4 may also be helpful.) Questions and issues for uncontrollable variables
include:

56
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
■How many items are to be studied? If there are thousands of items, it is wise to select, say,
every second or ﬁfth item in the SKU list and analyze them ﬁrst. A study of a small, repre-
sentative sample can indicate the magnitude of potential savings. It is important, however,
that both A and B items are chosen. In addition, it is desirable, if practical, to develop the
entire DBV curve. This is easy if current data are available in electronic form. If not, it may
not be worth the eﬀort.
■Are the items independent of one another? Dependence may be due to multiple items on a
customer order, complementary or substitute items, and shared production equipment.
■What does the supply chain look like? Speciﬁcally, can we consider this stocking point in
isolation of upstream and downstream locations, or is a multiechelon model necessary due
to signiﬁcant interrelationships with other production or distribution facilities?
■Are customer transaction sizes in single units or batches? If transactions are not necessarily
unit sized, are they still discrete or can they take on a continuum of values (e.g., the num-
ber of gallons or liters of gasoline demanded by a vehicle in a ﬁll-up)? As we shall see in
Chapters 6 and 7, unit-sized transactions are the easiest to model.
■Is demand deterministic or variable? If it is variable, is there a known probability distribution
that adequately describes it?
■Do customers arrive at a constant or variable rate? Again, if it is variable, can it be described
by a known probability distribution? These latter three bullet points often are considered
together by looking at the total demand over some time period, such as a day, week, or
month.
■Is the average demand seasonal, or is it somewhat constant over the year?
■What historical data are available? Forecasting models are the most accurate when there is
suﬃcient historical data to calibrate the model.
■How many customers are served? If the number is small, demands may not be independent
across time. For example, a large customer order today would reduce the probability of a
customer order tomorrow.
■How many, and how powerful, are the ﬁrm’s competitors?
■What is the typical customer promise time? If customers do not demand immediate deliv-
ery, it may be possible to reduce inventories by holding stocks of components, and then
assembling to order.
■How is customer service measured? What are the service-level targets?
■How many suppliers serve the ﬁrm? Do they oﬀer quantity discounts? Is supply seasonal? Are
all the units received of adequate quality to be used?
■What is the replenishment lead time (and its variability) for each item studied?
■Is there a concern about obsolescence or spoilage?
■What is the number, location, and capacity of each storage and manufacturing facility?
■What are the costs that we identiﬁed in Section 2.6.1 (A, v, r, and so on)?
For production operations, the following questions are also important:
■How many components go into each end item?
■Through how many processing stages do the products go?
■What is the capacity of the production equipment? How many shifts, hours per week, and
weeks per year? Are there any complete shutdowns during the year?
■What are the setup or changeover times for each part? Is there a sequence dependency in
these times? What are the processing rates for each part?

Frameworks for Inventory Management and Production Planning
■
57
■How reliable is the production equipment? Are breakdowns a problem? Does the ﬁrm
regularly schedule preventive maintenance?
■What is the layout of the factory? In other words, it should be positioned on the product-
process matrix.
■What are the yields of the equipment? (Yield is the proportion of a batch that is of acceptable
quality.)
Now we examine controllable variables:
■If there is more than one stocking or production location, where should each item be stored
or produced?
■How frequently should inventory levels be reviewed?
■When should each item be reordered or produced?
■How much should be ordered or produced? In what sequence, or in what groupings?
■How much productive capacity should be established? Should we recommend hiring, ﬁring,
or overtime?
■Should the product price be adjusted?
■Should the service targets be changed?
■What transportation modes, and other factors should be changed?
2.11.3 Synthesis
The second modeling stage, which is the third phase of the process, attempts to bring together the
vast amount of information gathered in the previous phase. The consultant now should establish
relationships among objectives, uncontrollable variables, and the means of control. For example,
how is the expected cost per unit time related to the demand rate, ordering cost, order quantity,
and so on? A mathematical objective function stated in terms of controllable variables is the most
common result of this phase, although it is not always so. This synthesis phase is a primary focus
of the remainder of the book, and therefore we will not devote more space to it here.
2.11.4 Choosing among Alternatives
This phase is the second primary focus of this book. Once we have an objective function, or
established relationships among objectives, uncontrollable, and controllable variables, it is necessary
to determine reasonable settings of the controllable variables by manipulating the model. This
can be done with calculus, search methods, and so on. If the decision is repetitive, it is desirable
to develop mathematical decision rules that provide the settings of the controllable variables in
terms of the uncontrollable variables. For example, the economic order quantity, to be discussed
in Chapter 4, determines the order quantity as a function of A, v, r, and the annual demand
rate. These decision rules should also allow for other factors that are not explicitly considered in
the model. (See Section 1.5 of Chapter 1.) Moreover, the model should accommodate sensitivity
analysis so that managers can get a feel for the result of changes in the input data. If the decision
is not repetitive, there is no need to develop a framework for repeated use. A “one-oﬀ” decision is
adequate.

58
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
2.11.5 Control
The control phase is primarily focused on implementation of the decision rules, or more generally,
the choices among alternatives. Here, the consultant must ensure that the system functions properly
on a tactical or short-range basis. One aspect will be discussed in more detail in Section 2.11.8.
Other questions and issues include:
■Training of the staﬀwho will use the new system.
■How often should the values of the control parameters (e.g., the order quantity) be
recomputed?
■How will the uncontrollable variables be monitored?
■How will the ﬁrm keep track of the inventory levels? In Section 2.11.9, we discuss this issue
in more depth.
■How will exceptions be handled? For example, when and how should managers override the
decision rules?
■What provision will be made for monitoring sales against forecasts? There are two reasons for
overseeing the forecasting system—(a) to take action to prevent serious shortages or overages
of stock; and (b) possibly to change the forecast model.
■What actions should be taken when stockouts occur or are imminent? Does the ﬁrm have
provision for expediting, alerting sales people, ﬁnding alternative sources of supply, and so
on?
■In the production environment, how will actual production be monitored against scheduled
production?
2.11.6 Evaluation
The ﬁnal phase is evaluation, or measuring how well the control system functions. If the consultant
gathered data on actual costs and customer service prior to implementation, which is extremely
wise, he or she can now compare them with the actual values under the new system. Likewise, to test
the validity of any models, it is useful to compare predicted with actual costs and service. Breaking
down the components of the total cost can yield an insight into the sources of any discrepancies.
2.11.7 General Comments
Even a carefully executed study can run into major diﬃculties that are not the responsibility of
the consultant. It is possible, for example, that an external forecasting system provides forecasts
that are worse than anticipated. These may reﬂect badly on the new inventory or production
system. The consultant should attempt to identify the reasons for unusually bad, or unusually
good, performance. If the model or data are wrong, adjustments can be made. On the other hand,
there may be resistance from people at the ﬁrm that led to poor performance.
It should be clear that implementation is a long, drawn-out process whose importance and
duration are both often underestimated. Gradual implementation, accompanied by extensive edu-
cation, is essential. Where possible, the so-called pilot approach should be ﬁrst utilized. Speciﬁcally,
the new system should be ﬁrst implemented on a trial basis on a limited class of items (e.g., on
only one of the several product lines manufactured by the ﬁrm). As noted above, provision should
be made for manual overrides of the output of computerized decision rules. In this regard, Bishop
(1974) describes a successful implementation where the apparent key factor that led to the adoption

Frameworks for Inventory Management and Production Planning
■
59
was a design option within the new decision system that allowed manual overrides of computer
decisions by the manager whenever he disagreed with them. “Early in the operation of the system,
approximately 80% of the items were overridden by the use of this feature . . . a year later this pro-
portion had declined to less than 10%.” According to Bishop, the inventory control manager, his
staﬀ, and his boss used the new decision system simply because they felt that they were in charge,
rather than at the mercy, of the innovation.
2.11.8 Transient Effects
Each time the parameters of a decision model are adjusted, a series of transient eﬀects result that
must be carefully monitored and controlled. Consider the recommendation of an analyst that
aﬀects the reallocation of inventory tied up in safety stocks in such a manner that total inventory
investment is not changed in the long run. The reorder points for some SKUs are raised, for others the
reorder points are lowered, and for the balance there is no change. If the management implemented
all the new reorder points at the same time, some of the newly calculated reorder points, raised from
the previous levels, would immediately trigger orders. If there were many changes, a sudden wave
of orders could overload a company’s manufacturing plant or order department and also result,
after a lead time, in an increase in on-hand dollar inventory investment.
The obvious solution is, of course, not to make all the changes at the same time. Some form
of phased implementation strategy that lengthens the period of transition and thereby dampens
the disruptions in the system must be chosen. To determine an acceptable transition strategy, the
following need to be balanced:
1. The cost of carrying extra inventories during the transition period
2. The expense of a higher than normal ordering rate
3. The opportunity cost of delaying beneﬁts from a new production/inventory decision system
that is not implemented all at once
4. Any beneﬁts resulting from the better than normal service level resulting from extra inventory
on hand during the transition period
In practice, the changeover to new decision rules is often carried out at the time when an SKU is
reordered. This works well if diﬀerent SKUs are ordered at “random” times. Alternatively, revised
decision rules are implemented in phases, starting with A items.
In either case, it is best to try to plan a large transition carefully; in particular, one should
closely monitor the resulting stockout rate, the net increase in orders placed, and the rise in total
dollar inventory. It is unlikely that the costs of transition can ever be determined and balanced
analytically. Therefore, a simulation of transient eﬀects that result from alternative implementation
strategies should be undertaken whenever the scope of the problem warrants such an expense.
2.11.9 Physical Stock Counts
Physical stock counts, taken annually in many organizations, are intended to satisfy the auditors
that account records reasonably represent the value of inventory investment. But the accuracy of
stock records is also an important aspect of production/inventory decisions. Most of the decision
systems described in this book would be seriously crippled by inaccurate records. See Swann (1989),
DeHoratius (2006), and DeHoratius and Raman (2008).

60
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
As a check on records, some physical counting of SKUs actually in stock has always been
deemed necessary. But physical counts have proven to be expensive and time consuming.* The
authors recall the words of a general manager during a tour of a steel-manufacturing operation:
“I am deliberately letting the inside inventory drop down to facilitate the annual stock counting.”
Performing a physical stock count has in the past in many companies involved could involve shut-
ting down all operations, and thereby losing valuable productive time. Because of this large oppor-
tunity cost, many companies have adopted diﬀerent procedures that achieve the same purpose.
Given a limited budget to be spent on corroborating inventory records with the physical inventory,
a system that more eﬀectively rations the available clerical resources is known as cycle counting.
In cycle counting, as the name might suggest, a physical inventory of each particular item is
taken once during each of its replenishment cycles. There are several versions of cycle counting, but
probably the most eﬀective one involves counting the remaining physical stock of an SKU just as
a replenishment arrives. This has two key advantages. First, the stock is counted at its lowest level.
Second, a clerk is already at the stocking position delivering the replenishment, so that a special
trip is not needed for counting purposes. Clearly, one drawback is that, if the records are faulty
on the high side, we may already have gone into an unexpected stockout position. Note that cycle
counting automatically ensures that low-usage SKUs are counted less often than high-usage items
because the frequency of reordering increases with sales volume (at least under a decision system
based on economic order quantities). Most auditors agree with physically counting low-value items
less often than the more expensive ones.
Paperwork, relating to an SKU being counted, can be outstanding at any point in time. When
outstanding paperwork exists, a disagreement between counted and recorded inventory may not
necessarily mean that the written records are in error. Cycle counts are for this reason in some
companies conﬁned to the ﬁrst thing in the morning, or the last thing in the day, or on the oﬀ
shift, when outstanding paperwork should be at a minimum. In any case, some form of cutoﬀrule
such as the following is required:
1. If a discrepancy is less than some low percent of the reorder point level, adjust your records
to the lower of the two ﬁgures and report any loss to accounting.
2. If the discrepancy is greater than some low percent, wait for a few days and request a recount.
One hopes by this time that outstanding paperwork will have been processed. If the dis-
crepancy is the same on both counts, we have probably found an error and should adjust
the records accordingly. If the second count results in a diﬀerent discrepancy, the problem
requires investigation.
There are some practical disadvantages and problems with cycle counting. Cutoﬀrules are not
easy to follow while normal everyday activity is going on. Checking up on the paperwork in the
system, so that stock levels may be properly corroborated, requires considerable perseverance and
diplomacy. The responsibility for cycle counting is often assigned to stockroom employees. As a
result, too often, cycle counting gets relegated to a lower priority, and may even be discontinued;
it may even be discontinued when business activity picks up and stockroom personnel ﬁnd it
diﬃcult to carry out their regular activities as well as stock counting. One solution in such cases
is to assign a permanent team to carry out cycle counting all year round. In an interesting study,
* Counting need not be done in a literal sense. An eﬀective, accurate way of estimating the number of units of
certain types of products is the use of weigh scales.

Millet (1994) found that inaccuracies in inventory records were often due to inaccurate physical
counts, and could be eliminated by providing incentives for those responsible for counting. See
also Hovencamp (1995) and Ziegler (1996).
Cycle counting rations eﬀort in proportion to annual dollar usage. It is important to recognize
that not all causes of stock discrepancies are a function of dollar usage. The authors once encoun-
tered a situation illustrating this point. Items that could be resold on the black market tended to be
out of stock more often. Although it could not be proven, it was possible that some of the stolen
parts were being resold back to the company through supposedly legitimate wholesalers. There-
fore, the accessibility, physical size, and resalability of items, as well as their dollar usage, had to be
considered in establishing procedures for stock counts.
Stratiﬁed sampling procedures can also be useful for reducing the required sample sizes,
particularly for audit purposes. Buck and Sadowski (1983) suggest this approach.
2.12 Summary
In this chapter, we have provided a number of frameworks for the manager and consultant that
are helpful in reducing the complexity of the task of managing inventories and production. In the
next and last chapter in this part of the book, we turn to the topic of demand forecasting in that
an estimate of future demand is clearly needed for all decisions in the production/inventory area.
Problems
2.1
Brieﬂy describe the inventory management problem(s) faced by a typical small neighbor-
hood restaurant. Recall Problem 1.5. Point out the diﬀerences in the inventory problem(s)
faced by a particular store in a more specialized chain such as McDonald’s or KFC.
2.2
Comment on the following statement: “Optimization models, because they make unre-
alistic assumptions and are diﬃcult for the user to comprehend, are useless in inventory
management or production planning and scheduling.”
2.3
Discuss the fundamental diﬀerences in the approach required to analyze the following two
types of inventory control problems:
a. A one-opportunity type of purchase that promises large savings
b. A situation where the options remain the same from one buying opportunity to the next
2.4
It has been argued that the ﬁxed cost of a setup A is not really ﬁxed but can vary throughout
the year when the production workload is seasonal. Discuss, and include the implications
in terms of the impact on replenishment lot sizes.
2.5
Assuming that you have no data on the total annual dollar movement ( Dv), which of the
following SKUs (and under what circumstances) should be classiﬁed as A, B, or C items?
a. Spare parts for a discontinued piece of manufacturing equipment
b. Bolts and washers
c. Subassemblies
d. Imported SKUs for resale
e. Motor oil
f. Perishable food stuﬀs
g. A Right Handed PS-37R-01
h. Widget invented by the company owner’s nephew
i. Platinum bushings

Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
If, in addition, you were supplied with ﬁgures on the annual dollar movement (Dv) for
each SKU, how could such ﬁgures aﬀect your classiﬁcation above? What other information
would you like to have? Finally, describe and classify one example of A, B, and C from your
experience.
2.6
An inventory, mostly made up of machined parts, consisted of 6000 SKUs valued (at full
cost) by the accounting department at $420,000. The company had recently built a new
warehouse at a cost of $185,000 that was ﬁnanced through a 12% mortgage. The building
was to be depreciated on a 25-year basis. The company’s credit rating was sound, and a bank
loan of $50,000 was under negotiation with the bank. The main operating costs per year in
the new warehouse were estimated to be as follows:
Municipal and other taxes
$5,732.67
Insurance on building and contents
3,200.00
Heating/air conditioning
12,500.00
Electricity and water
3,200.00
Labor (supervisor, three clerks, and a half-time janitor)a
69,000.00
Pilferage
5,000.00
Obsolescence
5,000.00
Total
$103,632.67
a
Includes 60% manufacturing overhead.
It was estimated that on average, each SKU involved one dollar of labor cost per dollar
of material cost.
a. Recommend a value for the carrying cost r in $/$/year.
b. Suppose that your recommended value for r is accepted by the management and the
accounting department. You proceed to calculate the economic order quantities for all
6000 items and discover that the new warehouse is too small to physically accommodate
all the inventory that is indicated by your calculations. What action would you take
now?
c. Alternatively suppose that your recommended value for r is accepted by the manage-
ment and the accounting department, but that the total dollar investment (based on
economic order quantities) that you estimate will be needed is approximately $800,000.
The top management is unwilling to have a total investment greater than $500,000.
What action would you take under such a circumstance?
2.7
Use Figures 2.8 through 2.10 for this problem. Assume that the raw materials and purchased
parts each represent 30% of the cost of goods sold and that value added (labor plus factory
overhead) constitutes the remaining 40%. Also assume that each production cycle involves
the production of 1000 units of ﬁnished goods, each valued (at cost) at $10/unit. In each
case depicted in the ﬁgures, ascertain the appropriate overall value of ¯Iv (i.e., the average
inventory level, expressed in dollars). Also describe, in terms of the production and demand
processes, how each of the patterns could result.

What parameters that aﬀect the diﬀerent functional categories of inventories could be
changed? For example, cycle stocks are determined in part by the setup cost, and it can
be changed. Give other examples, and note how the parameters could change.
2.9
Have a class representative (or representatives) select a random sample of 30 items stocked
in your university bookstore. For each item, obtain an estimate of Dv (from records or from
the manager of the store). Prepare a DBV table and a graph. See Table 2.1 and Figure 2.1.
2.10
The type of operation characterized by a large volume of identical or similar prod-
ucts ﬂowing through identical stages of production is typical in which of the following
industries?
a. Aerospace
b. Automobiles
c. Machine tools
For such a situation, which type of production planning and scheduling system is
appropriate? Explain your reasoning.
2.11
An important problem in the operation of a retail store is the allocation of limited shelf
space among a wide variety of products.
a. Discuss how demand is inﬂuenced by the allocation. Can individual items be treated
separately in this regard?
b. How are inventory-related costs of an item aﬀected by the space allocated?
2.12
Consignment stock is stock held by a retailer but owned by the supplier until it is sold
by the retailer. For the same SKU, discuss how you would model the associated inventory
carrying costs of the retailer (i) without consignment and (ii) with consignment.

Select 30 items at random from an inventory population in a local organization. These could
include the campus bookstore or supplies in a department oﬃce. For each item, ascertain
the value of Dv and develop a DBV table and graph. What percent of the total dollar usage
is contributed by the top 20% of the items (ranked by dollar usage)?
2.16
One of the major cost categories in this chapter is called “carrying costs.” See Section 2.6.1.
Until recently people did not appreciate that some quality-related costs could be appropri-
ately included in this category. Indicate why annual quality-related costs might change with
the production lot size.
2.17
For a local organization, identify the major cost factors included in Section 2.6.1, includ-
ing the ﬁxed cost of ordering or setup, A, the carrying charge, r, and the unit variable
cost, v, for just one item. Describe the components of each. For A and r, indicate brieﬂy
why you decided to include each component. What components did you ignore in your
analysis?

Appendix 2A: The Lognormal Distribution
2A.1 Probability Density Function and Cumulative Distribution Function
The density function of a lognormal variable x is given by*
fx(x0) =
1
bx0
√
2π
exp

−(ln x0 −a)2
2b2

(2A.1)
where a and b are the two parameters of the distribution.
We can see that the range of the lognormal is from 0 to ∞. It has a single peak in this range. A
sketch of a typical lognormal distribution is shown in Figure 2A.1. The name is derived from the
fact that the logarithm of x has a normal distribution (with mean a and standard deviation b).
The cumulative distribution function
px≤(x0) =
x0
−∞
fx(z)dz
can be shown to be given by
px≤(x0) = 1 −pu≥
ln x0 −a
b

(2A.2)
where pu≥is the probability that a unit normal variable takes on a value of u0 or larger, a function
tabulated in Appendix II.
2A.2 Moments
One can show (See Aitchison and Brown 1957) that the expected value of the jth power (for any
real j) of x is given by†
E(xj) = mjexp[b2j(j −1)/2]
(2A.3)
where
m = exp[a + b2/2]
(2A.4)
is the mean or expected value of x. The variance of x deﬁned by
σ2
x = E(x2) −[E(x)]2
can be shown, through the straightforward use of Equations 2A.3 and 2A.4, to be
σ2
x = [E(x)]2[exp(b2) −1]
* fx(x0)dx0 represents the probability that x takes on a value between x0 and x0 + dx0.
† In general, E(xj) =
∞
−∞xj
0fx(x0)dx0.

fx(x0)
Figure 2A.1
The lognormal probability density function.
Hence, the standard deviation σx is given by
σx = E(x)

exp(b2) −1
and the coeﬃcient of variation by
σx/E(x) =

exp(b2) −1
the latter depending only on the value of b.
If, as in a DBV of a population of n items, x is actually a discrete variable that takes on the values
xi (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) and the xi’s can be represented by a lognormal distribution with parameters m
and b, then
E(xj) =
n
i=1 xj

n
(2A.5)
and from Equation 2A.3 it follows that
n

i=1
xj
i = nmjexp[b2j(j −1)/2]
(2A.6)
Note that the parameter m can be estimated using the sample mean, that is,
m =

i=1 xi
n

2A.3 Testing the Fit of a Lognormal
One can easily test the ﬁt of a lognormal distribution to a set of data by taking natural logs and
then using a normal probability plot routine. Such routines are available in most statistical soft-
ware packages. See Section 3.5.5 for further discussion. Herron (1976) also provides an alternative
approach.

Chapter 3
Forecasting Models
and Techniques
Inventory and production-planning decisions nearly always involve the allocation of resources in
the presence of demand uncertainty. For inventory decisions, ﬁnancial resources must be deployed
to procure goods in the anticipation of a future sale of those goods. Similarly, for production
planning, capacity must be committed to certain products in anticipation of their future sale.
Eﬀective decision making in inventory management and production planning requires accurate
descriptions of possible demands in future periods. As noted earlier in Chapter 1, variability can
be a key driver of inventory expense. A study at a large high-tech ﬁrm revealed that 40% of the
inventories in their system were cycle and pipeline stocks, whereas 60% were due to variability. Of
the inventories driven by variability, 2% were held due to supplier performance variability, 2% were
held due to manufacturing variability, and 96% were held due to demand uncertainty. A similar
study at a large chemical producer revealed that 45% of ﬁnished goods inventory were held due
to variability, again with the majority of that inventory held due to demand variability. These two
examples highlight that while the relative impact of demand uncertainty on the inventory will
vary across industrial settings, demand uncertainty will almost always be a signiﬁcant factor for
inventory management.
Forecasts can be based on a combination of an extrapolation of what has been observed in the
past (what we call statistical forecasting) and informed judgments about future events. Informed
judgments can include the knowledge of ﬁrm orders from external customers, preplanned ship-
ments between locations within a single organization, or preplanned usage of service parts in
preventive maintenance. They also include marketing judgments such as the eﬀects of promo-
tions, competitor reactions, general economic conditions, and so on. For items or groups of related
items with accurately maintained historical demand data, we can apply techniques known as time-
series forecasting models. With a time-series forecasting model, we use the demand history for an
item (or group of items) to construct a forecast for the future demand of that item (or group).
Such time-series methods are commonly used in practice and, when the models are appropriately
selected and calibrated, they can be quite eﬀective in generating high-quality forecasts. The major-
ity of this chapter is dedicated to such time-series methods. In particular, we focus on generating
forecasts for a single item using time-series methods.

A suggested forecasting framework.
The overall framework of a suggested forecasting system is shown in Figure 3.1. The human
judgment we have mentioned is a crucial ingredient. Note also that, as the actual demand in a
period is observed, it is compared with the earlier forecast so that we can measure the associated
error in the forecast. It is important to monitor these errors for at least three reasons. First, the
quantity of safety (or buﬀer) stock needed to provide adequate customer service will depend (as
we will see in Chapter 6) on the sizes of the forecast errors. Second, the statistical forecast is
based on an assumed underlying mathematical model with speciﬁc values for its parameters. The
sizes and directions (plus or minus) of the forecast errors should suggest possible changes in the
values of the parameters of the model or even in the form of the model itself (e.g., introducing a
seasonal component, when it was not already present). Finally, the errors can provide a monitor
and feedback on the performance of the subjective input component of the forecasts.
Forecasting is of course a broad topic, and forecasts are used in many contexts from weather
predictions, predictions of asset prices, ﬁnancial or budgeting forecasts, etc. Given the scope of
this book, we focus on forecasts of product demand used to support production and inventory
resource allocation decisions although we note that many of the forecasting techniques discussed
can be applied to other settings. It is often said that the one thing we know about forecasts is
that they will be in error. This tends to be true if one views the forecast as a single number—
often called a point estimate—but to support an inventory or production decision, we need more
than just a single number. We need a richer description of the set of possible demand scenarios.
Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne a forecast as a description of future demand scenarios used to support a resource
allocation decision. Throughout this chapter, we ﬁrst focus on measuring the performance of the
point-estimate forecast. Later, we will discuss how we can use measures of this point-estimate
forecasting process to help complete our description.

Forecasting Models and Techniques
■
75
No matter how forecasts are generated, we are interested in evaluating the quality of the fore-
casts for two reasons. First, the historical performance of a forecasting process helps us create the
description of future demand to support resource allocation decisions. Second, by tracking the
performance of a forecasting process over time, we may be able to identify ways to improve that
process. This feedback loop is noted in Figure 3.1.
We present some deﬁnitions and notation for use throughout this and the following chapters:
■Demand observed in period t is represented by xt.
■ˆx represents a point forecast for a future period. This value will be indexed by two relevant
time periods: the period in which the forecast is made and the period the forecast is for.
A forecast made at the end of time period t for a future period t + τ will then be written
as ˆxt,t+τ. One would typically refer to this as the “lag-τ” forecast since it is a forecast for a
time period τ periods in the future. Quite often, we will focus on the “lag-1” forecast—the
forecast for one period ahead: ˆxt−1,t, or ˆxt,t+1.
■Let et−τ,t = xt−ˆxt−τ,t represent the forecast error associated with the forecast made in period
t −τ for period t. Deﬁned in this way, a negative value indicates that the point forecast was
higher than the observed demand. As mentioned in the previous point, we will often focus
on the “lag-1” forecast, and for notational convenience, we may write the lag-1 error et−1,t
as simply et.
This chapter is organized as follows. Section 3.1 discusses the plausible components of mathe-
matical models of a demand time series. Then, in Section 3.2, we present the three steps involved in
the use of a mathematical model—namely (1) the selection of a general form of the model, (2) the
choice of values for the parameters within the model, and, ﬁnally, (3) the use of the model for
forecasting purposes. Although the emphasis in this chapter, with regard to statistical forecasting,
is on individual-item, short-range forecasting (needed for inventory management and production
scheduling), we do brieﬂy present material appropriate to medium-range aggregate forecasting
(useful for production planning) in Section 3.3. This is followed, in Section 3.4, by a detailed
discussion of several diﬀerent procedures for short-range forecasting, with particular emphasis on
what is called as exponential smoothing. Section 3.5 is concerned with various measures of fore-
cast errors, building on our basic forecast error deﬁnitions given above. These measures are needed
for establishing safety stocks and also for monitoring the forecasting performance. Section 3.6
addresses how to deal with unusual kinds of demand. Then, in Section 3.7, we have considerable
discussion concerning how to encourage and use the human judgment input to forecasting. Issues
concerning special classes of items are raised in Section 3.8. Finally, in Section 3.9, we return to
tactical and strategic issues, speciﬁcally to the choice among diﬀerent forecasting procedures.
3.1 The Components of Time-Series Analysis
Any time series can be thought of as being composed of ﬁve components: level (a), trend (b), sea-
sonal variations (F), cyclical movements (C), and irregular random ﬂuctuations (ϵ). Level captures
the scale of a time series. See Figure 3.2. If only a level was present, the series would be constant
with time. Trend identiﬁes the rate of growth or decline of a series over time. See Figure 3.3 that
illustrates a positive linear trend. Seasonal variations can be of two kinds: (1) those resulting from
natural forces, and (2) those arising from human decisions or customs. For example, in the north-
ern United States and in Canada, the intensity of many types of economic activity depends on

prevailing weather conditions. On the other hand, department store sales increase before the start
of the school year, the timing of which is a human decision. Figure 3.4 illustrates an annual sea-
sonal pattern. Cyclical variations or alternations between expansion and contraction of economic
activity are the result of business cycles. Irregular ﬂuctuations in time-series analysis are the residue
that remain after the eﬀects of the other four components are identiﬁed and removed from the time
series. Such ﬂuctuations are the result of unpredictable events such as unusual weather conditions

and unexpected labor strife. They represent our inability to eﬀectively model what else may be
aﬀecting the time series we are studying.
Using these concepts, we can formulate a multiplicative model of a time series:
Demand = (Trend)(Seasonal)(Cyclic)(Irregular)
(3.1)
Demand = (b)(F)(C)(ϵ)
or an additive model:
Demand in period t = (Level) + (Trend) + (Seasonal) + (Cyclic) + (Irregular)
(3.2)
xt = a + bt + Ft + Ct + ϵt
or a mixed model (partly additive, partly multiplicative). There are statistical procedures for isolat-
ing each component. We comment further on this topic later in the chapter, but our discussion will
be restricted to models that, in general, do not incorporate cyclical eﬀects because we concentrate
on short- to medium-term forecasts.
3.2 The Three Steps Involved in Statistically Forecasting
a Time Series
It is conceptually useful to think in terms of three distinct steps involved in statistically forecasting
a time series of demands for an individual SKU (or the aggregated demand for a group of related
items). In this section, we provide an overview of these steps, and then in the later sections we

78
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
discuss each in greater detail. The steps are
Step 1 Select an appropriate underlying model of the demand pattern through time.
Step 2 Select the values for the parameters inherent in the model.
Step 3 Use the model (selected in Step 1) and the parameter values (chosen in Step 2) to forecast
the future demands.
The choice of the general type of underlying model to use for a particular item (or aggregated
group of items) depends very much on cost considerations. The more sophisticated and costly
models are really only appropriate for (1) medium- or long-term forecasting of an aggregated time
series, and (2) perhaps for short-term forecasts of A items. Trend and particularly seasonal com-
ponents should be introduced with care. It is often the case with B and C items that there is
insuﬃcient reliable historical data to adequately estimate the seasonal components. An analysis of
historical data (often woefully unavailable in companies embarking on the introduction of for-
malized forecasting procedures) should suggest the general types of models (e.g., seasonal or not,
additive or multiplicative, etc.) that would appear to be appropriate for a given time series. In addi-
tion, managerial knowledge of a particular market is invaluable in suggesting the presence of trends
or seasonal patterns.
Once a general form of the model is tentatively selected, it is necessary to estimate the values of
any parameters of that model. Estimation can be based on some form of statistical ﬁt to historical
data—for example, a least-squares criterion will be discussed in Section 3.3.1. Alternatively, partic-
ularly when there is limited or no historical data available, the estimates of parameters are made on
essentially a subjective basis—for example, saying that a new item in a family of comparable items
will have a seasonal pattern similar to that of well-established members of the family.
In the event that historical data exist, the time series generated by the tentatively selected model
(and its estimated parameter values) can be compared with the historical pattern. If the ﬁt is judged
to be inadequate, then, it is necessary to iterate back through Steps 1 and 2.
Once we are satisﬁed with the assumed underlying model, then, in Step 3, it is used, with the
estimated values of its parameters, to forecast future demands. This procedure, of course, implicitly
assumes that the model and its parameter values will not change appreciably over the period being
forecasted. If such changes can be predicted, then, appropriate subjective adjustments in parameter
values and in the nature of the model itself are called for.
As we described earlier (see Figure 3.1), as forecasts are made and errors are observed, managers
can adjust the estimates of the parameter values and judge the suitability of the model.
3.3 Some Aggregate Medium-Range Forecasting Methods
In this section, we provide a brief overview of some of the common models and procedures useful
for medium- and longer-term forecasting of an aggregate time series. Such forecasts are an impor-
tant input to the aggregate production-planning procedures to be discussed in Chapter 14. Our
intention is simply to discuss the general nature of the available methodology, and to provide ref-
erences where further details can be found. Moreover, there are several longer-range forecasting
techniques that we will not even mention. An excellent starting point for more information on
either medium- or long-term forecasting is the article by Makridakis (2008).
In Section 3.1, we showed both a multiplicative and an additive model (Equations 3.1 and 3.2),
each giving demand as a function of level, trend, seasonal, and cyclical components. In actual fact, it

may be necessary to ﬁrst apply a transformation to the demand data in order to achieve a reasonable
ﬁt with one of these models. The added complexity of such a transformation is warranted in
medium-range forecasting where we are dealing with relatively few (aggregated) time series and
forecasts. A class of transformations that has proved to be useful in practice (see Granger and
Newbold 2014) is
T(xt) = ln xt
(3.3)
So, T(xt), as opposed to xt, would be modeled and forecasted. Then, for any given forecast of
T(xt) the corresponding xt would be obtained by inverting the transformation, that is, solving
Equation 3.3 for x, in terms of T, or,
xt = eT
(3.4)
As an example, if xt = 20, T(xt) would be ln(20) = 2.996. We would use 2.996 in forecasting
activities. Then, if a forecast of T(xt+1) = 3.5, the actual forecasted demand, xt+1, would be
e3.5 = 33.115.
3.3.1 Regression Procedures
For illustrative purposes, we show only the simple, but common, case of an underlying model that
assumes that demand is a linear function of time:
xt = a + bt
(3.5)
A least-squares criterion is used to estimate values, denoted by ˆa and ˆb, of the parameters a and b.
The resulting modeled value of xt, denoted ˆxt , is then given by
ˆxt = ˆa + ˆbt + ϵt
(3.6)
If there are n actual historical observations xt (for t = 1, 2, . . . , n), then, the least-squares criterion
involves the selection of ˆa and ˆb to minimize the sum of the squares (S) of the n diﬀerences between
xt and ˆxt. That is,
S =
n

t=1
	
xt −ˆa −ˆbt

Through the use of calculus we can show that

(3.9)
Fitting such a model to the aggregate demand data for the item shown in Table 3.1, we obtain
ˆxt = 2961 + 48.68t
(3.10)
Once the parameters a and b are estimated, the model of Equation 3.6 can be used to forecast
(extrapolate) the demand in a future period. For example, the use of Equation 3.10 gives an esti-
mate of demand for the item in October 2015 (period 22) as being 4,032 packages. There are also

statistical procedures for estimating the adequacy of the straight-line ﬁt and for developing a con-
ﬁdence interval around the forecast (extrapolated) value for any future period. Details are available
in several sources such as Berger (2013).
Our discussion to this point has assumed that the independent variable used in the regression
is the time period t. More generally, multiple regression includes two or more exogenous variables.
Moreover, in autoregression, the demand in period t is postulated as a function of the demand
itself in earlier periods. As an illustration of the latter, we might have
xt = a1 + a2xt−1 + ϵt
which postulates that the demand in period t is a linear function of the demand in period t −1
plus an error term. A generalization to a system of autoregressive equations in several variables to
be forecast, as well as some exogenous variables, leads one into the ﬁeld of econometric forecasting.

Forecasting Models and Techniques

81
This includes the use of the so-called leading indicators. A variable y is said to be a leading indicator
of another variable x if changes in x are anticipated by changes in y. Multiple regression is some-
times referred to as forecasting by association because the variable of interest is forecasted indirectly
by its association with other variables. See, for example, Maddala and Lahiri (1992).
3.3.1.1 The Box–Jenkins Approach
Box and Jenkins (see Box et al. 2011) have had a profound eﬀect on the ﬁeld of statistical fore-
casting. They suggest a broad class of underlying statistical models of demand patterns, as well as
a procedure for selecting an appropriate member of the class based on the historical data available.
Conceptually the models are more complex than either the simple regression models (outlined in
Section 3.3.1) or the exponential smoothing procedures (to be covered in Section 3.4). However,
this complexity (and its associated additional costs) aﬀords an opportunity for more accurate fore-
casting, which is certainly of interest at the medium-term, aggregate level. In this section, we brieﬂy
introduce some aspects of the Box–Jenkins approach.
The so-called autoregressive-moving average (or ARMA) class of models represents the demand
in the current period, xt, by a weighted sum of past demands and unpredictable random
components. In mathematical terms:
xt = φ1xt−1 + φ2xt−2 + · · · + φpxt−p + ϵt + θ1ϵt−1 + θ2ϵt−2 + · · · + θqϵt−q
(3.11)
where the ϵ’s are the so-called white noise, namely, independent, normally distributed variables
with mean 0 and a constant variance, and the φ’s, θ’s, p, and q are constants.
Typically, Equation 3.11 can be simpliﬁed. Anderson (1976, p. 45) reports that many stationary
time series are adequately represented by ARMA models with p+q = 2, that is, at most three terms
on the right side of Equation 3.11. As an illustration, the following shows the case of p = 1, q = 1:
xt = φ1xt−1 + ϵt + θ1ϵt−1
(3.12)
Equation 3.11 in fact implies that the xt series is stationary with time (i.e., its expected value
and standard deviation do not change with time). At least two circumstances can invalidate this
assumption. First, there may be a trend (linear or higher order) in the underlying process. Second,
there may be seasonality. The Box–Jenkins approach can handle both of these circumstances by
introducing additional terms into Equation 3.11.
In Section 3.2, we discussed three steps involved in statistically forecasting a time series: selec-
tion of a model, estimation of the parameters of the model, and use of the model for forecasting
purposes. The Box–Jenkins approach involves considerable elaboration on the ﬁrst two of these
steps, because there is such a rich class of models from which to choose. See Box et al. (2011) for
further details.
3.4 Individual-Item, Short-Term Forecasting:
Models and Procedures
In this major section of the chapter, we concentrate on procedures for estimating and using the
model parameters. These procedures have been found to be reasonably accurate in terms of short-
term forecasts for individual SKUs. In addition, they are relatively simple and inexpensive to use,

82
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
in contrast with the methods of the previous section, and thus are practical to use for the high
volume of individual-item, short-term forecasts.
We restrict attention to procedures that are appropriate for at least one of the following assumed
underlying models of xt, the demand in period t:
xt = a + ϵt (Level model)
(3.13)
xt = a + bt + ϵt (Trend model)
(3.14)
xt = (a + bt)Ft + ϵt (Multiplicative trend-seasonal model)
(3.15)
where, as earlier,
a = a level
b = a (linear) trend
Ft = a seasonal coeﬃcient (index) appropriate for period t and the ϵt’s are independent random
variables with mean 0 and constant variance σ2
Of course, we never know the exact values of the parameters in Equations 3.13 through 3.15.
To make matters worse, the true values are likely to change with the passage of time. For example,
the arrival of a new competitor in the market is likely to reduce the level or trend by reducing the
current market share. Consequently, the procedures we discuss will be concerned with estimating
the current values of the parameters of the speciﬁc model under consideration. There are two
distinct aspects to estimation. First, there is the question of obtaining initial estimates prior to using
the model for forecasting purposes. Second, there is the updating of the most recent estimates as
we observe the demand (and hence the forecast error) in the latest period. For each procedure, we
discuss these two diﬀerent dimensions of estimation.
3.4.1 The Simple Moving Average
3.4.1.1 Underlying Demand Model
The simple moving average method is appropriate when demand is modeled as in Equation 3.13:
xt = a + ϵt
(3.16)
that is, a level with random noise. As mentioned above, the parameter a is not really known and is
subject to random changes from time to time.
3.4.1.2 Updating Procedure
The simple N-period moving average, as of the end of period t, is given by
¯xt,N = (xt + xt−1 + xt−2 + · · · + xt−N+1)/N
(3.17)
where the x’s are actual, observed demands in the corresponding periods. The estimate of a as of
the end of period t is then
ˆat = ¯xt,N
(3.18)
We can show that this estimate of a results from minimizing the sum of squares of errors over the
preceding N periods (see Problem 3.3). A slightly simpler version (for updating purposes) of the

Forecasting Models and Techniques
■
83
N-period moving average is easily developed from Equation 3.17 as
¯xt,N = ¯xt−1,N + (xt −xt−N)/N
(3.19)
Note from Equation 3.17 that the moving average is simply the mean of the N most recent obser-
vations. Provided that the model of Equation 3.16 holds, we know from basic probability that ˆxt,N
or ˆat is distributed with mean a and standard deviation σϵ/
√
N. The larger the N is, the more
precise will be the estimate, provided Equation 3.16 continues to apply over the entire set of peri-
ods. However, if there is a change in the parameter a, a small value of N is preferable because it will
give more weight to recent data, and thus will pick up the change more quickly. Typical N values
that are used range from 3 to as high as 12.
3.4.1.3 Initialization
In terms of initialization, an N-period moving average should not really be used until there are
N periods of history available. In actual fact, if early forecasts are essential, one can use a smaller
number of periods in the initial stages.
3.4.1.4 Forecasting
Because of the (level) nature of the model of Equation 3.16, it is appropriate to use our estimate ˆat
as a forecast at the end of period t for any future period:
ˆxt,t+τ = ˆat
(3.20)
where ˆxt,t+τ is the forecast, made at the end of period t, of demand in period t + τ (for τ =
1, 2, 3, . . .). This procedure can be developed on a spreadsheet quite easily, as is illustrated next.
See also Problem 3.14.
3.4.1.5 Illustration
For a product, PSF-008, columns 1–3 of Table 3.2 show the demand data during 2013. The 5-
month moving averages, beginning as of the end of May 2013, are shown in column 4 and the
associated 1-month ahead forecasts in column 6. We comment further on the results of Table 3.2
in the next section when we discuss the topic of simple exponential smoothing.
3.4.1.6 General Comments
The moving average approach requires the storage of N periods of historical data that must be
stored for each SKU. In addition, the weight given to each of these N data points is equal while
all older data points are disregarded. Intuitively, we may want to weight more recent observations
more heavily, but it seems inappropriate to completely discount the earlier data. It is possible to
modify the moving average approach with diﬀerent weights. The exponential smoothing approach
in the next section does precisely this in a compact way that is easy to implement.

3.4.2 Simple Exponential Smoothing
Simple exponential smoothing is probably the most widely used statistical method for short-term
forecasting. As we shall see, it is intuitively appealing and very simple to employ. An excellent
reference on this topic is Gardner (2006).
3.4.2.1 Underlying Demand Model
As in the case of moving averages, the basic underlying demand pattern assumed is that of
Equation 3.13, which, for convenience, we repeat here:
xt = a + ϵt
(3.21)
However, later, we will mention that the procedure is actually appropriate for a somewhat wider
range of demand models.
3.4.2.2 Updating Procedure
We wish to estimate the parameter a in Equation 3.21. Recall that in Section 3.3.1, we used a least-
squares regression on historical data to estimate parameters of the underlying models. However, we

Forecasting Models and Techniques
■
85
pointed out that regular least squares gives equal weight to all historical data considered. Simple
exponential smoothing can be derived by selecting ˆat, the estimate of a at the end of period t, in
order to minimize the following sum of discounted squares of residuals:
S′ =
∞

j=0
dj+1(xt−j −ˆat)2
(3.22)
where
d = a discount factor (0 < d < 1)
xt−j = the actual demand in period t −j
Note that, because d < 1, the weighting given to historical data decreases geometrically as we
go back in time. Exponential smoothing would really be more appropriately named geometric
smoothing (an exponential curve is a continuous approximation to geometrically decaying points).
The minimization of Equation 3.22 is carried out in the Appendix to this chapter. The resulting
estimate of a satisﬁes the following updating formula:
ˆat = αxt + (1 −α)ˆat−1
(3.23)
where α = 1 −d is known as the smoothing constant.
In addition, it can be shown (see, e.g., Johnson and Montgomery 1974) that ˆat is an unbiased
estimate of a; that is, Eˆat = a.
Equation 3.23 can be manipulated as follows:
ˆat = ˆat−1 + α(xt −ˆat−1)
or
ˆat = ˆat−1 + αet
(3.24)
where
et = the error in period t between the actual demand xt and the forecast ˆat−1 made at the end
of the previous period t −1
There is an intuitive appeal to Equation 3.24. We adjust the forecast for period t in the direction
of the previous error, with α throttling the strength of this adjustment. If the forecast ˆat−1 from
the previous period (t −1) was too low (the error is positive), it makes sense that we would want
to increase the next forecast, ˆat, which we do by adding αet to the previous forecast.
Note again that these equations can be developed quite easily on a spreadsheet. (See
Problem 3.15.) Equation 3.24 states that the new estimate of the level is the old estimate plus
a fraction of the most recent error. Practically speaking, we don’t ever really know whether any
particular error results from a random ﬂuctuation or whether a signiﬁcant shift in a has occurred.
As a result, the simple exponential smoothing model hedges by assuming that only a fraction of the
forecast error should be used to revise the estimate of a. Note from Equation 3.23 that as α tends
toward 0, our estimate is unchanged by the latest piece of information, while as α moves toward 1,
more and more weight is placed on the demand observed in the last period. In Section 3.4.5, we
comment on the selection of an appropriate value of the smoothing constant.

The updating procedure of Equation 3.23 can also be shown to minimize the mean-squared
error (MSE) of the one-period-ahead forecast for the following models that are both somewhat
more general than that of Equation 3.21:
Case 1 (Details can be found in Harrison 1967)
xt = at + ϵt
with
at = at−1 + δt
where the δt’s are random changes with mean 0 and independent of the ϵ’s. That is,
the level is subject to random changes through time (which is what we have implicitly
assumed earlier).
Case 2 The xt’s are generated by a modiﬁcation of the autoregressive process discussed in
Section 3.3.1. Speciﬁcally,
xt = xt−1 + ϵt = θ1ϵt−1
See Goodman (1974) for details.
The geometric weighting of historical data in exponential smoothing can also be seen by sub-
stituting a corresponding relation for ˆat−1 in Equation 3.23, and then repeating for ˆat−2, etc. This
gives
ˆat = αxt + (1 −α)[αxt−1 + (1 −α)ˆat−2]
= αxt + α(1 −α)xt−1 + (1 −α)2[αxt−2 + (1 −α)ˆat−3]
= αxt + α(1 −α)xt−1 + α(1 −α)2xt−2 + · · ·
ˆat =
∞

j=0
α(1 −α)jxt−j
(3.25)
We see the contrast with moving averages where the last N observations were given equal weight.
In addition, the recursion relationship of Equation 3.23 shows that only one value of a and the
most recent xt need to be retained. From the weighting of the terms in Equation 3.25, we can
ascertain (see Problem 3.4) that the average age of the data encompassed in ˆat is 1/α periods. In an
N-month moving average, the average age of the data used is (N + 1)/2. Equalizing the average
ages gives the following relationship between α and N:
α = 2/(N + 1)
(3.26)
3.4.2.3 Initialization
Where signiﬁcant historical data exist, one simply uses the average demand in the ﬁrst several
periods as the initial estimate of a. The numerical illustration will demonstrate this point. The case
where inadequate history exists will be addressed in Section 3.8.1.

3.4.2.4 Forecasting
As mentioned earlier, ˆat is an unbiased estimate, as of the end of period t, of the parameter a,
where the latter, according to Equation 3.21, is the expected demand in any future period. Thus,
our forecast, made at the end of period t, for any future period t + τ is
ˆxt,t+τ = ˆat
(3.27)
For deciding when to place a replenishment order and how much to order, we will be interested in
the total forecast over several unit time periods (e.g., the replenishment lead time may be 4 months,
while the forecast update period is 1 month). If we let ˆxt,t,u be the forecast, made at the end of
period t, of total demand from time t (end of period t) to time u, then from Equation 3.27 we
have
ˆxt,t,u = (u −t)ˆat
(3.28)
3.4.2.5 Illustration
We use the same example of product PSF-008 as we used earlier to illustrate a 5-period moving
average. In addition, for comparison, we use Equation 3.26 to select the smoothing constant that
gives the same average age of the data; that is,
α = 2/(5 + 1) = 1/3
(In actual fact, as will be discussed later, one would normally not use such a high value of α.)
In Table 3.2, the average of the ﬁrst 5 months’ sales (50.0) is taken as the initial value for the
exponentially smoothed average and plotted opposite t = 3, the midpoint of the 5-month range
of the average. Then, the exponentially smoothed average in column 5 for month 4 is calculated
by using Equation 3.23:
ˆat = 1
3x4 + 2
3 ˆa3
= 1
349 + 2
350 = 49.7
The same procedure was repeated for all subsequent months. For months 4 and 5, no exponen-
tially smoothed forecasts were issued to allow the eﬀect of setting initial conditions at ˆa3 = 50.0
to be smoothed out. This is commonly referred to as the “run-in period.” Rather than using
ˆa3 = 50.0, we could instead set ˆa0 = 50.0, and thus make the run-in time equal to 5 periods.
Using Equation 3.27, “exponential smoothing” forecasts were calculated for each period from
period 6 onward. These are shown in column 7 of Table 3.2. Note from columns 6 and 7 that
the exponential smoothing forecast outperforms the 5-month moving average forecast for 5 of the
7 months of 2013. This appears to be a result of the fact that by using α = 1/3, the simple
exponential smoothing forecast is made more responsive to recent sales data variation than the 5-
month moving average. Since the time series xt appears to be undergoing changes, this degree of
responsiveness appears to be warranted for the particular example shown.

3.4.2.6 General Comments
In summary, simple exponential smoothing is an easy to understand, eﬀective procedure to use
when the underlying demand model is composed of level and random components. Even when
the underlying demand process is more complicated, exponential smoothing can be used as part
of an updating procedure. For example, Steece and Wood (1979) use a Box–Jenkins model for the
aggregate demand time series of an entire class of items, and then use simple exponential smoothing
to update the estimate of a particular item’s demand as a fraction of the aggregate.
3.4.3 Exponential Smoothing for a Trend Model
The simple smoothing procedure presented in the previous section is based on a model without
a trend and therefore is inappropriate when the underlying demand pattern involves a signiﬁcant
trend. A somewhat more complicated smoothing procedure is needed under such circumstances.
3.4.3.1 Underlying Demand Model
The basic underlying model of demand is the pattern of Equation 3.14 that we repeat here.
xt = a + bt + ϵt
(3.29)
Again, we will make a reference later to somewhat more general models for which the suggested
smoothing procedure is also appropriate.
3.4.3.2 Updating Procedure
Holt (2004) suggests a procedure that is a natural extension of simple exponential smoothing
ˆat = αHW xt + (1 −αHW )(ˆat−1 + ˆbt−1)
(3.30)
ˆbt = βHW (ˆat −ˆat−1) + (1 −βHW )ˆbt−1
(3.31)
where αHW and βHW are smoothing constants and, for the demand model of Equation 3.29, the
diﬀerence ˆat −ˆat−1 is an estimate of the actual trend in period t. (We use the subscripts HW to
represent Holt-Winters since these smoothing constants will be part of a procedure of Winters, to
be discussed in Section 3.4.4.)
Harrison (1967), among others, shows that the Holt procedure minimizes the expected one-
period-ahead, mean-square forecast error for the trend model of Equation 3.29—in fact, for a more
general model where independent random changes in both a and b are possible for each period, in
addition to the random noise (the ϵ’s).
We use Holt’s updating as part of a popular procedure, to be described in Section 3.4.4, for
dealing with an underlying model involving both trend and seasonal components. However, in
this section, where there is no seasonality, we recommend instead a single-parameter procedure
suggested by Brown (1963), which turns out to be a special case of Holt’s method. Besides involving
only a single smoothing parameter, Brown’s procedure again has the intuitively appealing property
of being derived from minimizing the sum of geometrically weighted forecast errors (similar to

Forecasting Models and Techniques
■
89
the basis for the simple exponential smoothing procedure of Equation 3.23). Brown’s updating
equations are (see Problem 3.6)
ˆat = [1 −(1 −α)2]xt + (1 −α)2(ˆat−1 + ˆbt−1)
(3.32)
ˆbt =

α2
1 −(1 −α)2

(ˆat −ˆat−1) +

1 −
α2
1 −(1 −α)2

ˆbt−1
(3.33)
where α is the single smoothing constant (α = 1 −d again, where d is the discount factor used in
the geometrically weighted sum of squares).
Note that Equations 3.32 and 3.33 are the special case of Holt’s updating equations
(Equations 3.30 and 3.31), where
αHW = [1 −(1 −α)2]
(3.34)
βHW =
α2
1 −(1 −α)2
(3.35)
In Section 3.4.5, we address the issue of the selection of the α value.
3.4.3.3 Initialization
Typically, the initial values of the level (a) and the trend (b) are ascertained by doing a regular
(unweighted) least-squares regression on the historical data available. Suppose that there are n peri-
ods of data available. Smoothing will begin with the next period after this preliminary data. Thus,
we would like to have the level a computed relative to an origin at the end of the last period of the
ﬁtted data. That is, we should number the historical periods 0, −1, −2, −3, . . . , −(n −1) going
back in time. In other words, we wish to select a0 and b0 to minimize
S =
0

t=−n+1
[xt −(ˆa0 + ˆb0t)]2
Through the use of calculus, we obtain
ˆa0 =
6
n(n + 1)

t
txt + 2(2n −1)
n(n + 1)

and
ˆb0 =

n(n2 −1)

t

n(n + 1)


(3.37)
where all the summations range over the integers −(n −1), −(n −2), . . . , −2, −1, 0.
Where this initial regression is a relatively straightforward matter, the question arises as to why
we don’t simply redo a regression after each additional period of information instead of resorting to
the smoothing procedure of Equations 3.32 and 3.33. There are two reasons. First, the regression
gives equal weight to all historical information, whereas the smoothing reduces the weight geo-
metrically as we go back in time. Second, and less important, smoothing is less computationally
intensive, and therefore is more appropriate on a repetitive basis for short-term forecasting. As we

90
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
shall see, smoothing can be done by adding a single line to a spreadsheet for each new demand
data point.
The case where there is insuﬃcient history for regression initialization will be treated in
Section 3.8.1.
3.4.3.4 Forecasting
Because of the underlying model of Equation 3.29, we know that
ˆxt,t+τ = ˆat + ˆbτ
(3.38)
where
ˆxt,t+τ = the forecast, made at the end of period t, of the demand in period t + τ
Using Equation 3.38, we can rewrite Equations 3.30 and 3.31 in a manner similar to Equa-
tion 3.24 (for simple exponential smoothing) to highlight the intuition behind the adjustments to
the level and trend estimates ˆat, ˆbt.
ˆat = (ˆat−1 + ˆbt−1) + αHW [xt −(ˆat−1 + ˆbt−1)]
= ˆxt−1,t + αHW et
That is, the new estimate for the level ˆat is the old estimate for the level at time t plus an adjustment
based on the error, moderated by the smoothing constant. The trend-updating equation can be
rewritten for a similar intuition.
ˆbt = ˆbt−1 + βHW [(ˆat −ˆat−1) −ˆbt−1]
Here, the “error” used to adjust the new trend estimate is not the forecast error but the diﬀerence
between the old trend estimate and the recently estimated value for the trend obtained by taking
the diﬀerence between level estimates in periods t −1 and t.
To make a forecast for cumulative demand over a horizon, say from time t (end of period t) to
time u (end of period u), is
ˆxt,t,u =
u−t

τ=1
(ˆat + ˆbtτ)
(3.39)
When u is not exactly an integer, the last term in the summation should cover an appropriate
fraction of the last period.
3.4.3.5 Illustration
Consider another product PSF-016 where it is reasonable to assume that demand is growing,
approximately linearly, with time. Table 3.3 shows demand data for 15 consecutive months. Sup-
pose that the ﬁrst 6 months of data (January 2013 through June 2013) are used to estimate ˆa0 and
ˆb0. The use of Equations 3.36 and 3.37 gives
ˆa0 = 27.19
and
ˆb0 = 1.34
Suppose we do not use a run-in period and directly use these to forecast demand in July 2013
(t = 1), employing Equation 3.38. This gives us ˆx0,1 = 28.53. The resulting error in July 2013

is 27 −28.53 or −1.53. The parameters a and b are updated through the use of Equations 3.32
and 3.33 and a forecast ˆx1,2 is made at the end of July 2013, and so on. Continuing in this fashion,
we obtain the results in the last four columns of Table 3.3. (Note that in this, and all other tables in
this chapter, we have used a spreadsheet to compute the values shown. For presentation purposes,
we report numbers rounded to the nearest hundredth or so. Because the spreadsheet retains many
more digits than those shown, the results computed from the rounded numbers may diﬀer from
the results reported in the tables.)
3.4.3.6 A Model with Damped Trend
Sometimes, the data are so noisy, or the trend is so erratic, that a linear trend is not very accu-
rate, especially when forecasting several periods ahead. Gardner and McKenzie (1985) introduce
a damped trend procedure that works particularly well in these situations. The method follows
Equations 3.30 and 3.31 closely, and is quite easy to use. The updating and forecasting formulas are
ˆat = αHW xt + (1 −αHW )(ˆat−1 + φˆbt−1)
(3.40)
ˆbt = βHW (ˆat −ˆat−1) + (1 −βHW )φˆbt−1

ˆxt,t+τ = ˆat +


i=1

(3.42)

Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
where φ is a dampening parameter. Note the similarity of these equations with Equations 3.30,
3.31, and 3.38. In addition to ﬁtting a and b, we must also search for the best φ using historical
data. If 0 < φ < 1, the trend is damped and as τ gets large, the forecast approaches an asymptote
that is the horizontal line
ˆat + ˆbtφ/(1 −φ)
If φ = 1, the trend is linear, and therefore is identical with the model presented in this section.
If φ > 1, the trend is exponential, which Gardner and McKenzie (1985) note is dangerous in
an automated forecasting system. The authors show ways to reduce the number of parameters,
analogous to Brown’s procedure presented in Equations 3.32 and 3.33. They also test the model
and ﬁnd that it performs better than the simple linear trend models in most cases, particularly
as the forecast horizon grows. The related references include Lewandowski (1982), Gardner and
McKenzie (1985, 1989), and Gardner (1988, 1990).
3.4.3.7 Numerical Illustration
Using the data from Table 3.3, we can compute the forecasts using the damped trend procedure.
Using Equation 3.34, αHW = 0.556, because α = 1/3, and using Equation 3.35, βHW = 0.2.
Let us assume that a simple search for the best φ reveals that the smallest sum of squared errors
is obtained when φ = 0.4. Also, to be consistent with the previous example, let ˆa0 = 27.19 and
ˆb0 = 1.34. Then, from Equation 3.42, the forecast for July is ˆx0,1 = 27.19 + 0.4(1.34) = 27.73.
The resulting error in July 2013 is 27 −27.73 or −0.73. The updated parameters a and b are
found from Equations 3.40 and 3.41, and are 27.32 and 0.46, respectively. Then, a forecast ˆx1,2
is made at the end of July 2013, and so on. Continuing in this fashion, we obtain the results in
the last four columns of Table 3.4. The reader can verify that the sum of squared errors for this
example is somewhat smaller using the damped trend procedure than the linear trend approach.
Now consider a longer-term forecast. Speciﬁcally, let us forecast the demand for October 2013
(period 4) at the end of June 2013 (period 0). Using the linear trend model, and Equation 3.38,
we ﬁnd the forecast to be
ˆxt,t+τ = ˆat + ˆbtτ = 27.19 + 1.34(4) = 32.56
The damped trend model, using Equation 3.42 gives
ˆxt,t+τ = 27.19 +
4

i=1
(0.4)i(1.34) = 28.06
Because the actual demand for October is 25, the damped trend model is clearly more accurate
for this example. Note, however, that the linear trend model is more accurate when predicting
September’s demand (in June). As will be discussed in Section 3.4.5, we recommend some form of
search to choose an appropriate value of the dampening parameter. If it turns out to be 1, we have
simply replicated the linear trend model.

and ice cream. For individual items, the most common forecasting update period when seasonality
is present is 1 month. However, for illustration, we use a quarterly (trimonthly) update period. Inci-
dentally, the procedure to be discussed is potentially useful in aggregate, medium-range forecasting,
in which case quarterly periods are more meaningful.
3.4.4.1 Underlying Model
The underlying model assumed is that of Equation 3.15
xt = (a + bt)Ft + ϵt
(3.43)
where
a = the level
b = the linear trend
Ft = a seasonal index (coeﬃcient) appropriate for period t
ϵt = independent random variables with mean 0 and constant variance σ2
The season is assumed to be of length P periods and the seasonal indices are normalized so that, at
any point, the sum of the indices over a full season is exactly equal to P. With an annual season,
P = 12 for a 1-month forecast interval, and P = 4 for a quarterly interval. Seasonal models are
also applicable for a weekly “season” (e.g., demand for medical services at the emergency facilities

94
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
of a hospital), or even a daily “season” (e.g., customer demand for electrical energy as a function of
the time of the day). The special case when all the F’s equal unity represents a nonseasonal trend
model.
3.4.4.2 Updating Procedure
To use the model of Equation 3.43 repetitively for forecasting purposes, we must have esti-
mates of a, b, and the F’s. Winters (1960) ﬁrst suggested the following procedure, which is not
optimal in the sense, for example, of minimizing mean-square forecast errors. However, it is
intuitively appealing and is a natural extension of the Holt procedure for a trend model (see Equa-
tions 3.30 and 3.31). Speciﬁcally, the parameters are updated according to the following three
equations:
ˆat = αHW (xt/ ˆFt−P) + (1 −αHW )(ˆat−1 + ˆbt−1)
(3.44)
ˆbt = βHW (ˆat −ˆat−1) + (1 −βHW )ˆbt−1
(3.45)
ˆFt = γHW (xt/ˆat) + (1 −γHW ) ˆFt−P
(3.46)
where αHW , βHW , and γHW are the three smoothing constants that all lie between 0 and 1. The
selection of their values will be covered in Section 3.4.5.
In Equation 3.44, the term xt/ ˆFt−P reﬂects an estimate of the deseasonalized actual demand
in period t in that ˆFt−P was the estimate of the seasonal index for the most recent (P periods
earlier) equivalent period in the seasonal cycle. The rest of the terms in Equations 3.44 and 3.45 are
equivalent to those shown earlier in the nonseasonal Holt procedure (see Equations 3.30 and 3.31).
In Equation 3.46, the term provides an estimate of the seasonal factor based on the latest demand
observation. Thus, Equation 3.46, consistent with all the earlier exponential smoothing equations,
reﬂects a linear combination of the historical estimate and the estimate based on the latest piece of
data. At all times, we wish to have the sum of the indices through an entire season added to P. Thus,
when a speciﬁc index is updated, we renormalize all indices to achieve this equality. A numerical
illustration will be shown after a discussion of the initialization and forecasting procedures.
As with simple exponential smoothing and exponential smoothing with a trend, we can rewrite
the updating equations to show how the old estimate is updated.
ˆat = (ˆat−1 + ˆbt−1) + αet/Ft−P
ˆbt = ˆbt−1 + βHW [(ˆat −ˆat−1) −ˆbt−1]
ˆFt = Ft−P + γHW (xt/ˆat −Ft−p)
The level ˆa is updated in a similar way to exponential smoothing with a trend where the only
diﬀerence is that the error used is adjusted by the seasonal index F. Since the estimates a and b
are already seasonally adjusted, the updating equation for the trend estimate ˆb is the same as in
exponential smoothing with a trend. The new seasonal index is calculated by updating the index
from one season ago (period t −P) and adjusting based on the diﬀerence between the most recent
observation of the seasonal eﬀect xt/ˆat and the previous seasonal index.

3.4.4.3 Initialization
With both trend and seasonal factors present, the initialization becomes considerably more com-
plicated. One has to properly separate out the trend and seasonal eﬀects in the historical data.
Several diﬀerent initialization procedures have been suggested, but we restrict our attention to
the most commonly used method, the so-called ratio to moving average procedure (which dif-
fers from Winters’ original suggestion). This approach can eﬀectively handle changes in the
underlying trend during the historical period. In addition, it tends to eliminate cyclical eﬀects
(which we are not explicitly considering). Further details are available in Hamburg and Young
(1994).
Ideally, from a statistical standpoint, it is desirable to have several seasons worth of data because
each speciﬁc seasonal period (e.g., the month of June) occurs only once per season (year). This is
especially true for slow-moving items, or for items with highly erratic demand, because the noise
in the data can obscure the underlying seasonality. However, when using too much history, one
runs the risk of the seasonal pattern having changed during the history, so that the early portion is
no longer representative of the current, let alone, future conditions. As a compromise, we suggest a
minimum of 4 complete seasons, using 5 or 6 (with care) if that much is available. The case where
insuﬃcient data exist will be treated in Section 3.8.1.
There are several steps in the procedure. We use the example, shown in Table 3.5 and Figure 3.5,
of quarterly sales (in 2011–2014) for product EDM-617.
Step 1 Initial Estimation of Level (Including Trend) at Each Historical Period. The demand in
any historical period is assumed to be composed of trend (incorporating the level), seasonal,
and random components. To estimate the seasonal indices, we must ﬁrst remove the trend
eﬀect. The trend point (i.e., the level) for any particular period t is estimated by a moving
average of a full season (i.e., P periods) centered at period t. A full season is used in order to
have the moving average free of seasonal eﬀects. Because the most common seasons have an
even number of periods (P = 4 or 12), the standard P-period moving average ends up being
centered between two periods, not right at the middle of a period as desired. To overcome this
problem, we take the average of two consecutive moving averages, as illustrated in Table 3.5.
In columns 5 and 6, we show 4-period moving averages that are computed from consecutive
time periods. For example, the ﬁrst entry of column 5, 54.25, is the average of the ﬁrst four
data points (43, 57, 71, and 46), and therefore is centered between quarters 2 and 3 of 2011.
The ﬁrst entry of column 6, 56.00, is the average of the four periods beginning at quarter 2
of 2011 (or, 57, 71, 46, and 50), and therefore is centered between quarters 3 and 4 of
2011. Column 7 is the average of these two averages, and, therefore, is the centered 4-period
moving average for quarter 3 of 2011. These centered moving averages are also portrayed in
Figure 3.5.
Step 2 Estimates of Seasonal Factors. The estimate of the seasonal factor (column 8 of Table 3.5)
for any particular historical period t is obtained by dividing the demand xt (column 4) by the
centered moving average (column 7). Note that, because of the moving average procedure,
we cannot obtain estimates for the ﬁrst half-season (ﬁrst two quarters of 2011) nor for the
last half-season (last two quarters of 2014). Estimates still include the random components.
In an eﬀort to dampen the random eﬀect, we average the seasonal factors for similar periods
in diﬀerent years. For example, in Table 3.5, the average of the 3rd quarter factors is (1.288+
1.365 + 1.286)/3 or 1.313. The averages obtained in this fashion are shown in column 2 of
Table 3.6. The total of the averages need not add up to exactly P (4 in our example). Thus,

we normalize to obtain the estimates of seasonal indices that total to P. The results are shown
in column 3 of Table 3.6.
Step 3 Estimating ˆa0 and ˆb0. We still need estimates of the level and trend terms in Equation 3.43.
Using the seasonal indices found in Step 2, we deseasonalize the data as shown in Table 3.7.
(Once again, we have rounded the data in the table, but the spreadsheet that computes
column 6 retains many more digits.) The results are also shown graphically in Figure 4.8.
They are reasonably close to the centered moving averages found in Table 3.5, because, in
this example, the seasonal coeﬃcients found in Table 3.5 do not ﬂuctuate very much from
year to year. In any event, a regression line is now ﬁt to the data of column 6 in Table 3.7
using the procedure of Equations 3.36 and 3.37 of Section 3.4.3. This gives us estimates ˆa0
and ˆb0 as of the end of 2014 (the end of period 0). The resulting line is shown in Figure 3.6;
the parameter values are
ˆa0 = 76.866
and
ˆb0 = 1.683

to the latest data (beyond the shift). (See Williams (1987) for an alternate way of initializing

3.4.4.4 Forecasting
The underlying model includes level, trend, and seasonal factors. As of the end of period t we have
ˆxt,t+τ = (ˆat + ˆbtτ) ˆFt+τ−P
(3.47)
where ˆxt,t+τ is the forecast, made at the end of period t, of demand in period t + τ and ˆFt+τ−P
is the most recent estimate of the seasonal index for period t + τ. (This assumes τ ≤P; the last
direct update of ˆFt+τ−P was made in period t + τ −P. However, when any other seasonal index is
updated, renormalization could cause ˆFt+τ−P to change somewhat.)
As earlier, the forecast of cumulative demand from the beginning of period t + 1 through to
the end of period u is given by
ˆxt,t,u =
u−t

τ=1
ˆxt,t+τ
(3.48)
where again, if u is not an integer, the last term in the summation reﬂects an appropriate proportion
of the last period.

3.4.4.5 Illustration
We again use the item EDM-617. First, consider the forecast ˆx0,1 of the demand in the ﬁrst quarter
of 2015 made at the end of 2014. The previous ﬁrst quarter was t = −3. From Table 3.6, we thus
have ˆF−3 = 0.869. Also ˆa0 = 76.866 and ˆb0 = 1.683. Thus, from Equation 3.47 we have
ˆx0,1 = (76.866 + 1.683)0.869 = 68.222 units
Similarly, the forecasts at the end of 2014 for the other three quarters of 2015 are
ˆx0,2 = (76.866 + 1.683(2))1.061 = 85.161 units
ˆx0,3 = (76.866 + 1.683(3))1.317 = 107.886 units
ˆx0,4 = (76.866 + 1.683(4))0.753 = 62.946 units
Suppose that the actual demand in the ﬁrst quarter of 2015 was 75 units. The level, trend, and
seasonality factors can now be updated. Assume that the smoothing constants αHW , βHW , and
γHW have values of 0.2, 0.1, and 0.3, respectively. From Equation 3.44, the updated value of the
level is given by
ˆa1 = αHW (x1/ ˆF−3) + (1 −αHW )(ˆa0 + ˆb0)
= 0.2(75/0.866) + 0.8(76.866 + 1.683) = 80.110

100
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
Next, from Equation 3.45, the revised estimate of the trend is given by
ˆb1 = βHW (ˆa1 −ˆa0) + (1 −βHW )ˆb0
= 0.1(80.110 −76.866) + 0.9(1.683) = 1.839
Then, by using Equation 3.46, we obtain the updated estimate of the seasonality factor for the ﬁrst
quarter as
ˆF1 = γHW (x1/ˆa1) + (1 −γHW ) ˆF−3
= 0.3(75/80.110) + 0.7(0.869) = 0.889
Because of the change in this seasonality factor, we renormalize the four seasonality factors so that
they again add to 4:
1.061 + 1.317 + 0.753 + 0.889 = 4.020
Therefore,

Note that demand for period 1 was forecast (at the end of period 0) as 68.222 units. Actual
demand turned out to be 75 units; that is, demand was underforecast by 6.778 units. Because
of this forecast error, the level was adjusted upward from 76.866 to 80.110—an increase of
3.244 units, considerably more than was predicted by the original trend value of 1.683 units.
Moreover, the estimate of the trend was increased from 1.683 to 1.839, and the estimate of the
seasonality factor was raised from 0.869 to 0.884.
The new estimates of the parameters can now be used in Equation 3.47 to provide a revised set
of forecasts as of the end of period 1 (the ﬁrst quarter of 2015). To illustrate, the new forecast of
demand in the second quarter of 2015 is
ˆx1,2 = (ˆa1 + ˆb1) ˆF−2
= (80.110 + 1.839)(1.056) = 86.544
The forecasts for the remaining two quarters of 2015 are also shown in Table 3.8.

Once the ﬁgure for actual sales in quarter 2 of 2015 becomes available, the above procedures
must be repeated—the parameters (level, trend, and seasonal factors) revised and a new set of
revised forecasts issued.
3.4.4.6 General Comments
Clearly, updating, forecasting, and particularly initialization are considerably more complicated
with a seasonal model than was the case with the earlier nonseasonal models. Implementing the
equations on a spreadsheet also requires a bit more creativity. (See Problem 3.17.) Thus, the deci-
sion to use a seasonal model should be taken with care. In the initialization stage, if the initial F’s
are all close to unity or ﬂuctuate widely from season to season, then, a seasonal model is probably
inappropriate. (See Sections 3.6 and 3.7; Chatﬁeld 1978, 2013; McLeavey et al. 1981; Rhodes
1996.)
There are other, quite diﬀerent approaches to dealing with seasonality. In particular Brown
(1981, Chapter 9), among others, argues for the use of a transcendental model that is a mix of sine
waves. This approach has the merit of being more parsimonious (fewer parameters than seasonal
indices) and hence tends to be more stable, particularly when the demand level is quite low. How-
ever, we feel that this advantage is usually outweighed by the much more intuitively understandable
nature of the seasonal indices model.
Finally, there are certain “seasonal” eﬀects whose changing nature can be predicted. One of
the best examples is the Easter holiday that for some years occurs in March and some in April.
Although the monthly data can be distorted by this eﬀect, the distortion can be anticipated, so that
it is necessary for human input to modify the forecasts. Regular promotions are another example;
they may occur each summer, but at slightly diﬀerent times. (Section 9.7.1 addresses some of
these issues for style goods.) Another anomalous situation arises where it is crucial (perhaps for
production-scheduling purposes) to use monthly data to forecast the demand rate per day. Under
these circumstances, one should take into account of the varying numbers of days from month to
month. In other circumstances, it is simply adequate to consider the diﬀering numbers of days as
being part of the contribution to diﬀering seasonal factors.
3.4.5 Selection of Smoothing Constants
We now address the choice of the smoothing constants for the various smoothing procedures dis-
cussed earlier. For the moment, we restrict our attention to a static choice, that is, values that will

102
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
essentially remain unchanged over time for any particular SKU. In Section 3.5.4, the case where
the smoothing constants can vary with time, so-called adaptive smoothing, will be treated.
There is a basic trade-oﬀin the choice of the values of the smoothing constants. Small val-
ues, which give little weight to the most recent data, hence considerable weight to the history,
are appropriate under stable conditions—they eﬀectively smooth out most of the random noise.
On the other hand, if the parameters of the underlying demand model are changing apprecia-
bly with time, then higher values of the smoothing constants are in order, because they give
more weight to recent data and thus more quickly bring the parameter estimates into line with
the true changed values. Unfortunately, we are never really sure whether forecast errors are a
result of random (transient) noise or a real change in one or more of the parameter values in
the underlying demand model. Therefore, a compromise must be made in choosing the values
of the smoothing constants. Harrison (1967) quantiﬁes this compromise under special assump-
tions about the inherent variability of the model parameters. (See also Adshead and Price 1987;
Johnston and Boylan 1994.) An additional point related to the same issue is that, all other fac-
tors being equal, the smoothing constants should increase with the length of the forecast update
period, because the likelihood of changes in the model parameters increases with the passage of
time.
In general, we suggest the use of a search experiment to establish reasonable values of the
smoothing constants. For each of a number of representative items, the following experiment
should be conducted. The available demand history is divided into two sections. The ﬁrst sec-
tion is used to initialize the model parameters in the updating procedure selected. Then, with these
initial values, the smoothing is carried through the second portion of the data, using a speciﬁc com-
bination of values for the smoothing constants. Some appropriate measure of eﬀectiveness (e.g., the
mean of the squared forecast errors to be discussed in Section 3.5) is evaluated. This is repeated,
on a grid search basis, to ﬁnd the combination of values of smoothing constants that minimizes
the measure of eﬀectiveness across a class of similar items. In actual fact, exact minimization is not
required because the measures of eﬀectiveness always tend to be quite insensitive to deviations of
the smoothing constants from their best values. Furthermore, we wish to use only a few sets of
smoothing constants, each set being employed for a broad class of items.
Moreover, any case where minimization occurs when unusually large values are used for the
smoothing constants should be viewed with caution. As an illustration, a large value (>0.3) of α in
the simple smoothing procedure should raise the question of the validity of the assumed underlying
level model. The high smoothing constant, in this case, suggests that perhaps a trend model is more
appropriate. Further discussion on the aforementioned search can be found in Winters (1960),
and Gardner and Dannenbring (1980).
Keeping these suggestions in mind, we now present, for each of the smoothing procedures
discussed earlier, ranges of reasonable values of the parameters found through our experience and
that of several other individuals, as reported in the literature.
3.4.5.1 Simple Exponential Smoothing
Recall from Equation 3.23 that the updating procedure is
ˆat = αxt + (1 −α)ˆat−1
The likely range of α is 0.01–0.30 with a compromise value of 0.10 often being quite reasonable.

3.4.5.2 Smoothing for a Trend Model
Earlier, we suggested the use of Brown’s single parameter updating method. For reference purposes,
we repeat Equations 3.32 and 3.33.
ˆat = [1 −(1 −α)2]xt + (1 −α)2(ˆat−1 + ˆbt−1)
(3.49)
ˆbt =


(ˆat −ˆat−1) +

1 −
α2
1 −(1 −α)2

ˆbt−1
(3.50)
The range of α values prescribed under simple smoothing is also applicable here.
3.4.5.3 Winters Seasonal Smoothing
Repeating Equations 3.44 through 3.46, the updating procedure is
ˆat = αHW (xt/ ˆFt−P) + (1 −αHW )(ˆat−1 + ˆbt−1)
(3.51)
ˆbt = βHW (ˆat −ˆat−1) + (1 −βHW )ˆbt−1
(3.52)
ˆFt = γHW (xt/ˆat) + (1 −γHW ) ˆFt−P
(3.53)
As pointed out earlier (in Equations 3.34 and 3.35), Equations 3.49 and 3.50 are a special case of
the Holt procedure where
αHW = [1 −(1 −α)22]
(3.54)
and
βHW =
α2
1 −(1 −α)2
(3.55)
This suggests that reasonable guidelines for the choices of αHW and βHW in Equations 3.51
and 3.52 are provided by substituting the above suggested α values into Equations 3.54 and 3.55.
The results are shown in Table 3.9 along with the suggested values of γHW , the latter found
through experimentation. Again, we emphasize that, where possible, a search experiment should
be conducted with demand data for the particular population of items involved.*

Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
3.5 Measuring the Performance of a Forecasting Process
No matter how forecasts are generated, we are interested in evaluating the quality of the forecasts for
two reasons. First, the historical performance of a forecasting process helps us create the description
of future demand to support resource allocation decisions. Second, by tracking the performance of
a forecasting process over time, we may be able to identify ways to improve that process. When we
speak of the accuracy of a forecast, we generally mean some measure of how far away our point-
estimate forecast is from the actual value. A challenge is trying to separate the dispersion of forecast
errors from the bias. Measures of bias tell us how far oﬀthe forecasts are from the target on average,
but they do not tell us how widely or narrowly scattered the forecast errors are.
Signiﬁcant bias may signal that the parameters of the underlying demand model have been inac-
curately estimated or that the model itself is incorrect. Alternatively, it may be human adjustments
to forecasts that are causing the bias. We revisit the impact of human judgment in Section 3.7.
Where forecasts are used for production planning and inventory management decision mak-
ing, either of these situations is undesirable; removing bias from the forecast will improve the
performance.
A common measure of bias is the average error over some time horizon, say n periods, where
periods could be days, weeks, months, etc. As noted above, we represent the forecast error for lag-τ
forecasts by et−τ,t.
¯e = Average Error =
n

t=1
et−τ,t/n
(3.56)
A closely related measure sometimes used in practice is the sum (rather than the average) of forecast
errors. This is sometimes referred to as the running sum of forecast errors.*
Cn = Sum of Errors =
n

t=1
et−τ,t
(3.57)
Both ¯e and Cn allow positive and negative errors to cancel each other out over time. So, with either
of these measures, if their value is close to zero, we say that the forecasting process is unbiased;
forecasts (point estimates) are not consistently too high or consistently too low. “Close to zero” is not
a terribly precise term obviously; so, we need to be concerned with scaling or interpreting ¯e and Cn
to try to decide whether our forecast is biased. The challenge is that due to the random component
in a demand pattern, it is not easy to detect an underlying bias; the noise tends to camouﬂage it.
We return to this issue in Section 3.9.2 after introducing measures of dispersion and accuracy.
The standard deviation of forecast errors for a forecasting process (forecasting for a unit period),
σ1, gives us a measure of dispersion of forecast errors
σ1 =
n
t=1(et−τ,t −¯e)2
(n −1)
* Another measure of bias commonly used in practice is the average of actual values divided by forecasts. If over
time this value is close to 100%, we conclude that our forecasting process is unbiased. This kind of measure is
more frequently used as a summary performance measure for many forecasts aggregated.

Forecasting Models and Techniques
■
105
where ¯e is the average forecast error deﬁned in Equation 3.56. σ1 tells how variable forecast errors
are but does not speak to bias.
It is critical to note that none of these measures by themselves gives a complete description that
could support a resource allocation decision. To see why, suppose we were evaluating a forecasting
process that generated forecasts that were always exactly 1,000 units too high (e.g., xt −ˆxτ,t =
−1,000). The average error ¯e = −1,000 and the standard deviation of forecast errors στ = 0.
This forecasting process has no dispersion or variability but is clearly quite biased. Alternatively,
suppose the forecast errors alternated between 1,000 and −1,000. Such a forecasting process is
unbiased (average error ¯e = 0) but has high dispersion. As we will discuss further below, when
forecast bias is detected, identifying and eliminating the cause of the bias must be a priority.
3.5.1 Measures of Forecast Accuracy
In this section, we introduce three widely used measures of forecast accuracy, MSE, mean absolute
deviation (MAD), and mean absolute percent error (MAPE). As will be demonstrated in Chapter 6,
for purposes of establishing the safety stock of an individual item (to provide an appropriate level of
customer service), we will need an estimate of the standard deviation (σL) of the errors of forecasts
of total demand over a period of duration L (the replenishment lead time). In this section, we
concentrate on estimating σ1, the standard deviation of errors of forecasts of demand made for a
unit period. (A unit period is a forecast update interval.) In Section 3.5.2, we discuss the conversion
of the estimate of σ1 to an estimate of σL. The procedures to be discussed are appropriate for A and
B items. C items will be handled by simpler methods to be presented later.
Suppose that we have two types of information for each of n unit time periods, speciﬁcally
(1) the actual observed demands, x1, x2, . . . , xn and (2) the one-period-ahead forecasts (by some
particular forecasting procedure) ˆx0,1, ˆx1,2, . . . , ˆxn−1,n where, as earlier, ˆxt,t+1 is the forecast, made
at the end of period t, of demand in period t + 1. The measure of variability that is often used
(minimized) in ﬁtting of squared errors of a straight line to historical data is the MSE. When
forecasts are unbiased, the MSE is directly related to σ1, as we shall see shortly. Because of these
properties, and because it can be computed easily on a spreadsheet, we recommend its use. The
MSE for one-period-ahead forecasts is given by

A second measure of variability, the MAD, was originally recommended for its computational
simplicity. With the widespread availability of computers, however, the MAD is of less practical
importance. Nevertheless, it is intuitive, and still frequently used in practice. For the n periods of
data, the estimate of the MAD for one-period-ahead forecasts would be
MAD = 1

The term xt −ˆxt−1,t is the error (et−1,t) or the deviation in the forecast for period t. The vertical
lines indicate that we take the absolute value of the diﬀerence. Finally, the mean of the absolute
deviations results by the summation and division by n.

The MAPE is another intuitive measure of variability. It generally is not aﬀected by the magni-
tude of the demand values, because it is expressed as a percentage. However, it is not appropriate
if demand values are very low. For example, a forecast of 1 unit of demand matched with an actual
value of 2 units shows an error of 100%. The manager should decide whether a reported error of
100%, or of 1 unit, is more desirable. The MAPE is given by

3.5.1.2 Conversion to σ1
To ﬁnd the standard deviation of forecast errors, for the purpose of setting safety stock levels, we
can use a simple relationship between the value of σ1 and the MSE:
σ1 =
√
MSE
(3.61)
This relationship assumes that forecasts are unbiased. As noted above, removing bias from a fore-
casting process should be a priority. If bias remains, the approach in Equation 3.61 will tend to
overestimate σ1. So, with unbiased forecasts, a reasonable estimate of σ1, denoted as ˆσ1, is the
square root of the MSE calculated from the sample data. We illustrate how to initialize the MSE
below.
The relationship of σ1 to the MAD is not as simple. However, for the normal distribution and
unbiased forecasts, we can show that the following relationship holds between the true MAD (the
average absolute deviation from the mean) and the true standard deviation (See the Appendix of
this chapter for a derivation.):
σ = (

π/2)MAD = 1.25 MAD ≈
√
MSE

108
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
Thus, in cases where the normal distribution is appropriate, one can estimate σ1 via
ˆσ1 = 1.25 MAD
For several other common distributions, the theoretical conversion factor from the MAD to σ is not
very diﬀerent from 1.25. However, the factor can vary enough so that the safety stock obtained may
not provide the required level of service. See Jacobs and Wagner (1989). Therefore, we recommend
using the MSE.
3.5.1.3 Updating of MSE
In theory, Equation 3.58 could be used to update the estimate of MSE each time an additional
period’s information became available. Instead, we advocate a simple exponential smoothing form
of updating
MSEt = ω(xt −ˆxt−1,t)2 + (1 −ω)MSEt−1
(3.62)
where MSEt is the estimate of MSE at the end of period t and ω is a smoothing constant. (A small
value of ω, namely between 0.01 and 0.10, should normally be used.)
There are two reasons for using Equation 3.62 instead of Equation 3.58. First, storage of an
indeﬁnitely long history is required for the use of Equation 3.58, whereas only the most recent
MSEt−1 need be stored for Equation 3.62. Second, in using Equation 3.58, each period of his-
tory is given equal weight. In contrast, geometrically decaying weights occur through the use of
Equation 3.62. In fact, these arguments are identical to those presented earlier in the chapter when
we advocated exponential smoothing, instead of repeated least-squares regression, for updating the
forecasts themselves.
3.5.1.4 Initialization of MSE
For each of the forecasting procedures discussed in Section 3.4, we suggested a method for estimat-
ing initial values of the parameters of the underlying model of demand, using suﬃcient available
historical data. For such a situation, the initial estimate of MSE is obtained through the use of the
following equation that is closely related to Equation 3.58:
MSE0 =
0

t=−(n−1)
(xt −˜xt)/(n −p)
(3.63)
where the n historical periods are numbered from 0 (the most recent period) back through
−1, −2, . . . , −(n −1), and ˜xt is the estimate of xt resulting from the underlying demand model
when the estimates of its p parameters are obtained from the historical data. (E.g., if the underlying
model was a linear trend, xt = a + bt, then p would be 2 and ˜xt would be ˆa0 + ˆb0t.)
The denominator in Equation 3.63 is n −p, rather than n, to reﬂect that our estimate of
MSE is based on an ex-post ﬁt to the data, where the data have already been used to estimate the
p parameters of the model.
The case where insuﬃcient historical information exists will be treated in Section 3.8.1.

3.5.2 Estimating the Standard Deviation of Forecast Errors over
a Lead Time
As mentioned earlier, the replenishment lead time is unlikely to be equal to the forecast update
interval. Thus, we need a method of converting ˆσ1 (our estimate of σ1) into ˆσL (the corresponding
estimate of σL). The exact relationship between σL and σ1 depends in a complicated fashion on
the speciﬁc underlying demand model, the forecast-updating procedure, and the values of the
smoothing constants used. See, for example, Brown (1963), Harrison (1967), and Johnston and
Harrison (1986). One of the reasons for the complexity is that the smoothing procedure introduces
a degree of dependence between the forecast errors in separate periods. Fortunately, however, we
have found that for most inventory systems, the following model satisfactorily captures, empirically,
the required relationship:
ˆσL = Lc ˆσ1
(3.64)
where
ˆσL = estimate of the standard deviation of forecast errors over a lead time of duration L basic
(forecast update) periods (L need not be an integer)
ˆσ1 = estimate of the standard deviation of forecast errors over one basic (forecast update) period
c = coeﬃcient that must be estimated empirically

To check the reasonableness of Equation 3.64 for a particular ﬁrm, we proceed as follows. We select,
say, 10 representative SKUs. We should pick, say, 6 from the A category and 4 from the B category,
for which a number of years of historical monthly demand data are available. Assume that we have
7 years of data. Using the ﬁrst 4 years of data, we initialize the Winters exponential smoothing
model by the procedures described in Section 3.4.4. That is, for each of the 10 representative
SKUs, we obtain the data needed to initialize the Winters forecast equation (Equation 3.47):
ˆxt,t+τ = (ˆat + ˆbtτ) ˆFt+τ−P
(3.65)
Then, for the ﬁfth, sixth, and seventh years of the demand data, Equation 3.65, along with the
Winters updating procedures described in Equations 3.44 through 3.46, is used to issue the fore-
casts listed in Table 3.12. In all cases, the model parameters are updated monthly. For each forecast
in Table 3.12, the forecast ﬁgure is compared to the actual demand that resulted over the immediate
period of duration L, and the associated forecast error is computed by using
Forecast error = et(L) =

where
¯e(L) = 
t et(L)/n is the average error for the L under consideration
n = number of lead times of length L used (see the right-hand column of Table 3.12)
As a result of all the above calculations, there are 10 values (one for each of the SKUs) of ˆσL for
each of L = 1, 2, 3, . . . , 6. For each SKU, the 5 values of ˆσL/ˆσ1 are computed for L = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
The 50 values of log(ˆσL/ˆσ1) are then plotted against log L, as shown in Figure 3.8. Equation 3.64
can be written as
ˆσL/ˆσ1 = Lc or log(ˆσL/ˆσ1) = c log L

Therefore, the slope of the line through the origin that gives a reasonable ﬁt to the 50 data points
is an estimate of c. The line with slope c = 0.6, plotted in Figure 3.8, gives a reasonable ﬁt for the
data shown. So, for these data, we choose to use this approximation, which gives
log(ˆσL/ˆσ1) = 0.60 log L
ˆσL = L0.60 ˆσ1 =
√
Lˆσ1
(3.67)
The result of Equation 3.67 could also be obtained by assuming that in an L period, the forecast
errors in consecutive periods are independent and each has standard deviation σ1. In actual fact,
both of these assumptions are violated to some extent. Nevertheless, the empirical behavior of
Equation 3.67 is often quite reasonable. However, we hasten to recommend that an analysis, such
as that leading to Figure 3.8, be carried out for any system under consideration. If a straight line
through the origin is a reasonable ﬁt, then, its slope, which need not be 0.6, gives the estimate of c
in Equation 3.64.
3.5.3 Monitoring Bias
As noted above, we use the word bias to indicate that, on average, the forecasts are substantially
above or below the actual demands. A bias signals some fundamental problem in the forecasting
process. This could be the result of manual intervention in the forecasts or, if we are simply eval-
uating forecasts coming from a statistical model, bias would indicate that the parameters of the
underlying demand model have been inaccurately estimated or that the model itself is incorrect.
Where forecasts are used for production planning and inventory management decision making,
either of these situations is undesirable. Because of the random component in a demand pattern,
it is not easy to detect an underlying bias; the noise tends to camouﬂage it. In general, the forecast

error, et, should ﬂuctuate around zero. A simple graph of forecast errors can indicate whether they
are showing a trend on the high or low side. Figure 3.9 illustrates a case in which there is no bias
until about month 20, and then the errors show a negative trend. In this section, we discuss three
more rigorous measures of bias; then, in Section 3.5.4, we brieﬂy present the subsequent corrective
actions.
3.5.3.1 Cumulative Sum of Forecast Errors
Harrison and Davies (1964) suggest the use of cumulative sum techniques to monitor the bias in
a forecasting procedure. Speciﬁcally, the cumulative sum of forecast errors is computed recursively
using
Ct = Ct−1 + et
(3.68)
where
Ct = cumulative sum of forecast errors as of the end of period t, see Equation 3.57
et = xt −ˆxt−1,t = one-period-ahead forecast errors in period t
It is advisable to normalize with respect to the MSE; that is, use
Ut = Ct/

MSEt
(3.69)
where Ut is the cumulative sum tracking signal, and MSEt is the MSE at the end of period t.
Ut can take on any value, which is positive or negative. Nevertheless, if the forecasting proce-
dure is unbiased, Ut should ﬂuctuate around 0. An interesting property of the cumulative sum Ct
is that on a graphical plot, if a straight line ﬁt to it is reasonable over several periods, then, the
slope of the straight line gives us an estimate of the average bias of a single-period forecast. More

Forecasting Models and Techniques
■
113
advanced versions of the cumulative sum technique are based on graphical techniques that detect a
certain amount of bias within a speciﬁc number of periods. Further details are available in Gardner
(2006) and Chatﬁeld (2013) among others.
3.5.3.2 Smoothed Error Tracking Signal
Trigg (1964) suggests the use of a smoothed error tracking signal employing the MAD, although it
can be adjusted for the
√
MSE. This tracking signal has some nice intuitive properties, which will
be discussed below. However, it also has a potential drawback in that there can be a signiﬁcant lag
before an actual change in the model (or its parameter values) is identiﬁed. Moreover, it is not easy
to identify after the fact as to when exactly the change took place. The cumulative sum is more
eﬀective in both senses. The smoothed error tracking signal is deﬁned by
Tt = zt/MADt
(3.70)
where
Tt = value of the smoothed error tracking signal at the end of period t
MADt = mean absolute deviation of one-period-ahead forecast errors as of the end of period t
(updated in a like manner to the MSE in Equation 3.62)
zt = smoothed forecast error at the end of period t
We update z in a fashion analogous to MSE. Note that the signs of the errors are retained
zt = ω(xt −ˆxt−1,t) + (1 −ω)zt−1
(3.71)
where ω is a smoothing constant.
For an unbiased forecasting procedure, the smoothed forecast error zt should ﬂuctuate about
zero. Consider two consecutive forecast errors, one of which is positive, and the other is negative.
We can see from Equation 3.71 that in the computation of zt the eﬀects of these two errors will
tend to cancel one another. In contrast, in the computation of MADt, where the absolute value
of et is taken, no canceling occurs. Continuing this line of reasoning, we can write that
−MADt ≤zt ≤MADt
The limiting equalities are achieved if all errors are positive or if all errors are negative. From
Equation 3.70, the equivalent limits on the tracking signal Tt are
−1 ≤Tt ≤1
Moreover, Tt will be close to one of the limits if most of the errors are of the same sign, which is
an indication that the forecasting system is biased (most of the forecasts are too high or most of the
forecasts are too low).
3.5.3.3 Illustration
We illustrate both the cumulative sum and the smoothed tracking signal with the same example.
Consider the item pictured in Figure 3.9 and let t = 22. At the end of period 21, suppose that we

114
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
have the following values:
ˆx21,22 = 100 units of demand in period t
MAD21 = 6.25
z21 = 1.71
and
MSE21 = 57.95
C21 = 19.30
Therefore, T21 = 1.71/6.25 = 0.27 and U21 = 19.30/
√
57.95 = 2.54. Now, it happens that
demand in period 22 is 92 units, so the forecast error is −8. New values are computed, assuming
that we use ω = 0.1. For the cumulative sum, we update MSE, C, and U as follows:
MSE22 = 0.1(92 −100)2 + 0.9(57.95)
= 0.1(64) + 0.9(57.95) = 58.55 units
C22 = 19.30 −8 = 11.30
U22 = 11.30/
√
58.55 = 1.48
Note that the MSE has increased due to the larger-than-usual error. The cumulative sum has
decreased by 8, and the tracking signal has decreased, because the error was negative. The cumula-
tive sums are also illustrated in Figure 3.10. (We have connected the points for clarity.) Note how
they turn sharply negative due to the negative bias in the forecast errors after period 20.
Using a smoothing approach similar to that in Equations 3.62 and 3.71 is
MAD22 = 0.1|92 −100| + 0.9(6.25)
= 0.1(8) + 0.9(6.25) = 6.43 units
Also Equation 3.71 gives
z22 = 0.1(92 −100) + 0.9(1.71)
= 0.1(−8) + 0.9(1.71) = 0.74 units
So T22 = 0.74/6.43 = 0.12. Note again that the relatively large negative forecast error in
period 22 has increased MAD slightly but has caused z to become closer to 0 because z21 was
positive.
3.5.3.4 Serial Correlation (or Autocorrelation) of Forecast Errors
The serial correlation of a time series measures the degree of dependence between successive obser-
vations in the series. With an appropriate forecasting model, there should be negligible correlation
between separate forecast errors. If signiﬁcant positive (negative) correlation exists, then, this indi-
cates that forecast errors of the same (opposite) sign tend to follow one another. This, in turn,

signals the likelihood of errors in the speciﬁcation of the demand model or its parameter values.
Further details on the computation and properties of serial correlation can be found in several
books on probability and statistics (see, e.g., Cox and Miller 1977).
3.5.4 Corrective Actions in Statistical Forecasting
As discussed above, there are at least three diﬀerent measures of potential bias caused by incor-
rect speciﬁcation of the underlying demand model or inaccurate estimates of the values of its
parameters. We say “potential” because large absolute values of the tracking signals and substantial
serial correlation can, from time to time, be simply generated from the random component in the
demand pattern. In this regard, McKenzie (1978) develops statistical properties of the smoothed
error tracking signal. The choice of threshold (or critical) values of the signals or serial correlation
is completely analogous to the choice of the boundaries between acceptance and rejection in sta-
tistical hypothesis testing. There are two types of potential errors. First, we can take a corrective
action when nothing has really changed. Second, we can do nothing when, in fact, a fundamental
change has taken place. The choice of the threshold (or critical) values of the bias measures involves
a, usually implicit, trade-oﬀbetween these two types of errors.
There are two general types of corrective actions that can be used. The ﬁrst, which tends to
be utilized in a more automated mode, is to increase the values of the smoothing constants in the
hope that the form of the underlying model is still correct and all that is needed is to more quickly
smooth the parameter estimates closer to their true, but unknown, values. The second type of
corrective action is more substantive. It typically involves human intervention to make signiﬁcant
changes in the parameter estimates or in the form of the demand model itself. We discuss each in
turn.

Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
3.5.4.1 Changing the Smoothing Constants: Adaptive Forecasting
The general idea of adaptive smoothing is that the smoothing constants are increased (i.e., smooth-
ing becomes faster) when the tracking signal, T or U, gets too far away from 0, while smoothing
is decreased as T or U returns closer to 0. We discuss one of the better known adaptive-forecasting
techniques, and then reference others.
Eilon and Elmaleh (1970) develop an approach to adaptive smoothing that consists of set-
ting a smoothing constant to a ﬁxed value, and then making forecasts for a speciﬁed number
of periods (called the evaluation interval). At the end of the evaluation interval, forecast errors
are computed using the demand time series that actually occurred. Forecast errors are also com-
puted for a range of permitted values of the smoothing constant (0.1–0.9) to see what size forecast
errors would have resulted if one of these values had been used over the evaluation interval. The
permitted value of the constant that would have minimized the forecast error variance over the his-
torical evaluation interval is then used until the next evaluation interval. The procedure is repeated
periodically. Alternative procedures and enhancements can be found in Chow (1965), Trigg and
Leach (1967), Roberts and Reed (1969), Montgomery (1970), Whybark (1973), Flowers (1980),
Gardner (1983), Fliedner et al. (1986), and Williams (1987).
Unfortunately, although all these procedures have an intuitive appeal, substantial research ﬁnd-
ings (see, e.g., Chatﬁeld 1978; Ekern 1981; Flowers 1980; Gardner and Dannenbring 1980)
suggest that adaptive methods are not necessarily better than regular, nonadaptive smoothing. In
particular, there are dangers of instabilities being introduced by the attempt at adaptation. Conse-
quently, we suggest that careful testing be undertaken with actual time series from the organization
under study before any automatic adaptive procedure is adopted.
3.5.4.2 Human Intervention
Where suﬃcient bias exists or where smoothing constants remain at high levels, it may be
appropriate to call for human intervention. Suﬃcient bias could be deﬁned by
|Tt| > f
where f is a threshold fraction, or by
|Ct| > k
√
MSE
where k is some threshold multiple.
The choice of f or k implicitly involves the trade-oﬀbetween the two types of errors mentioned
above—namely (1) not intervening when such an action is necessary, and (2) intervening when it
is unnecessary. Lower thresholds would be used for A items than for B items, because the ﬁrst type
of error is relatively more expensive for A items; for B items, we would like to keep interventions
on an exception basis. In actual practice, a reasonable way to establish f or k is by trial and error in
order to provide a reasonable intervention workload in an aggregate sense. In other words, if f or
k is too low, managers will be overwhelmed by having to intervene so frequently. Plausible initial
values are f = 0.4 and k = 4.
Signiﬁcant assistance can be provided to the intervener through a display of several periods of
recent actual demands and forecasts made by the most current version of the model. The individual
should attempt to ascertain the reason for the recent poor performance. There may be factors,
external to the model, that have changed recently, such as

Forecasting Models and Techniques

117
1. A temporary eﬀect—for example, a sales promotion.
2. A more permanent eﬀect—for example, a new competitive product or a new market
penetration.
A temporary eﬀect could lead to human override of forecasts for a few periods. On the other
hand, a more permanent eﬀect could be handled by manually adjusting parameter values or even by
changing the nature of the demand model. If the visual display indicates that the change occurred
for several periods in the past, it may be appropriate to reinitialize the model using only data since
the suspected time of the change. See Hogarth and Makridakis (1981), Ashton and Ashton (1985),
Lawrence et al. (1986), and Heath and Jackson (1994). Some of these papers provide forecasting
models that capture both historical demand and human expertise. In Section 3.7, we provide some
guidelines for incorporating human judgment.
3.5.5 Probability Distributions of Forecast Errors
As we will see in Chapter 6, the selection of safety stocks to provide adequate customer service
will depend not just on the standard deviation of forecast errors over the replenishment lead time
but, instead, on the whole probability distribution of these errors. Of particular concern will be
the probabilities of large positive values of the errors (demand minus forecasts) because such errors
can lead to serious stockout situations.
Through most of this book, we recommend the use of a normal distribution of forecast errors
for three reasons. First, empirically the normal distribution usually provides a better ﬁt to data than
most other suggested distributions. Second, particularly if the lead time (or lead time plus review
interval) is long, forecast errors in many periods are added together, so that we would expect a
normal distribution through the Central Limit Theorem. Finally, the normal distribution leads to
analytically tractable results. Nevertheless, particularly for expensive, slow-moving items, it may be
appropriate to use an alternative distribution such as the exponential, Gamma, Poisson, or negative
binomial. In any event, before making a choice, one should at least perform a relatively simple test
of the ﬁt of the normal distribution to the observed forecast errors for each of a number of repre-
sentative items. There is a special normal probability paper such that the cumulative distribution
of a normal distribution will appear as a straight line on it. Thus, one can plot the empirical cumu-
lative distribution and observe how closely it is ﬁt by a straight line. In addition, many statistical
software packages are available for personal computers. These packages usually contain procedures,
including the goodness-of-ﬁt (or chi-square) test and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, for testing the
ﬁt of data to a hypothesized distribution. See, for example, Marx and Larsen (2006).
3.6 Handling Anomalous Demand
In general, one should have a healthy suspicion of data that are purported to represent actual
customer demand period by period. First, in most organizations, sales or even just shipments to
customers are recorded as opposed to demand. If not properly interpreted, a series of periods in
which a stockout situation existed would imply no demand in each of those periods. Further-
more, if backordering is permitted, the periods immediately following the stockout may show
sales or shipments well above the actual demands in those periods. For approaches to forecast-
ing when stockouts distort the demand data, see Wecker (1978), Bell (1981), Taylor and Thomas
(1982), Lovejoy (1990), Agrawal and Smith (1996), Nahmias (1994), Lariviere and Porteus (1999),
and Lau and Lau (1996a).

Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
Furthermore, recording and transmission errors can distort the demand picture. Certain types
of demand also may not be normally handled on a routine basis by the production/stocking point
under consideration and thus should not be incorporated in the forecast updating. For example,
unusually large customer orders may be shunted back to the higher level of supply. Orders larger
than a certain size may be directly shipped from a central warehouse rather than by the usual mode
of transshipment through a regional branch warehouse. Finally, there may be certain temporary
changes in the demand pattern (e.g., eﬀects of promotions and price changes) that should be
ﬁltered out prior to updating.
A useful aid in monitoring anomalous demand is to have an exception signal trigger human
investigation when the “demand” stated for a particular period diﬀers from the forecast by more
than k
√
MSE where a k value of 3–4 is not unreasonable. (Note that this signal is for a sin-
gle demand value, whereas the thresholds in Section 3.5.4 were for a tracking signal and a
cumulative sum.)
3.7 Incorporation of Human Judgment
An overall framework for forecasting was shown in Figure 3.1. In it, the input of human judgment
played a key role. Such intervention is quite common in practice. For example, both Sanders
and Manrodt (2003a) and Fildes and Goodwin (2007) report results from surveys of forecasters
indicating that judgment plays a substantial role in sales forecasting in practice. Lawrence et al.
(2006) provide an excellent discussion of research on judgmental input to forecasts, and Armstrong
(2001b) is an excellent, in-depth resource for several key concepts in sales forecasting, including
concepts for eﬀectively incorporating human judgment.
In Sections 3.5.4 and 3.6, we have already seen the evidence of manual intervention in an essen-
tially reactive fashion, that is, responding to signals of forecast bias or unusual demand levels. Now,
we concentrate on the proactive use of human judgment. However, clearly there is considerable
overlap in that a reactive response will often initiate a proactive input.
Obviously managerial judgment as an input is essential in medium-range, aggregate forecasting.
The decisions concerning work force levels, operating hours, seasonal inventory levels, and so forth,
are of major importance to an organization and thus justify the devotion of a considerable amount
of management time. Moreover, there are relatively few time series to be forecasted because of
the aggregation. One approach that has proved to be helpful is the Delphi method (see Basu and
Schroeder (1977) for an illustration). Most of the remaining discussion will concentrate on shorter-
range forecasting, but many of the ideas are also applicable in the medium range.
3.7.1 Factors Where Judgment Input Is Needed
There are a number of factors, normally not included in a statistical forecasting model, where
judgment input is clearly needed. These factors can be categorized along two diﬀerent dimensions:
ﬁrst, factors that are external to the organization versus those that are internally inﬂuenced; second,
factors that have a temporary eﬀect versus a more or less permanent eﬀect. Our discussion will
concentrate on the ﬁrst dimension.
Factors external to the organization include
1. The general economic situation (e.g., the inﬂation rate, the cost of borrowing capital, and
the unemployment rate).

Forecasting Models and Techniques
■
119
2. Government regulations such as subsidies, import duties and/or quotas, pollution restric-
tions, safety standards, etc.
3. Competitor actions.
4. Potential labor stoppages at the customer level (users of our products).
5. Consumer preferences (particularly with regard to style goods).
The important factors internal to the organization include
1. Price changes.
2. Promotions.
3. Advertising.
4. Engineering changes that, for example, will improve the reliability of a product, thus reducing
the demand for service parts.
5. Introduction of substitute products. A classic example was the eﬀect on the sales of slide rules
that resulted from the introduction of hand calculators.
6. Opening a new distribution outlet for an existing product.
7. The pipeline-ﬁlling eﬀect associated with the introduction of a new product. A temporary
surge of demand will occur simply to initially place appropriate levels of the inventory at the
various stocking points.
Related to internal factors is the need to ensure that the total (in dollars) of statistical forecasts
of individual items agrees reasonably well with the aggregate ﬁnancial plan of the organization.
Some success has been achieved in introducing some of the above judgmental factors into
a form of the statistical forecasting model known as Bayesian forecasting. The general approach
is discussed by Harrison and Stevens (1971), Harrison and Stevens (1976), Johnston (1980),
Fildes (1983), Azoury (1985), Kaplan (1988), Bradford and Sugrue (1991), Karmarkar (1994),
and Eppen and Iyer (1997).
Fildes and Goodwin (2007) discuss four case studies and go on to suggest practices for max-
imizing the value of judgmental input. Their recommendations, with which we wholeheartedly
agree, include limiting adjustments to statistical forecasts, requiring the forecaster to document
their reasons and assumptions when an adjustment is made, and tracking the impact of behav-
ioral adjustments. Fildes et al. (2009) provide an example of the insights from tracking behavioral
adjustments in practice. Their work shows that small adjustments to forecasts tend to hurt fore-
casting performance while large adjustments improve the performance. This is primarily due to the
fact that large adjustments are made only when a manager has signiﬁcant and relevant information.
3.7.2 Guidelines for the Input and Monitoring of Judgment
It is advisable to think in terms of a small committee being responsible for the judgmental input.
Ideally, the membership should include an individual with a broad perspective (e.g., from strate-
gic planning), as well as representatives from marketing, production/inventory management, and
engineering/design. Meetings should be held on the order of once per month.
This committee is likely to be concerned with groups or families of items, perhaps by geo-
graphic region. The starting point in each case should be the objective (statistical) forecast, aggre-
gated across the appropriate group of items. In addition, recent demand history and the associated
forecasts should be available. The committee should be able to easily adjust the aggregate fore-
cast. Then, a computer routine should simply prorate a family adjustment to the individual-item
forecasts according to the recent fractions of family demand represented by the individual items.

120
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
It is often helpful to ensure that the committee develop and record their forecasts individually
before talking as a group. Otherwise, the more inﬂuential members of the committee might sway
the others. The committee can then take the average and variance of the independent forecasts.
Further discussion on this topic can be found in Fisher et al. (1994) and Fisher and Ittner (1999).
Gaur et al. (2007) show how judgmental forecasts can be eﬀectively used to develop estimates for
the mean and variance of demand.
It is important to provide feedback on the performance of the judgmental input. This is
accomplished by retaining both the original statistical forecast and the revised (through judgment)
forecast. When the actual demand materializes, one can then show the statistical forecast error and
the error of the judgmental forecast. In fact, a report can be developed listing the diﬀerence of
the two errors (likely normalized by dividing by
√
MSE) for each family of items forecasted. The
listing can be ranked by relative performance of the two methods. The intention should not be to
externally evaluate the human input. Rather, the objective should be to provide a mechanism for
the committee members themselves to learn from their earlier successes and failures.
The above discussion focuses on trying to maximize the value of judgment in improving fore-
cast accuracy. In many instances, there are other motives that may lead to judgmental inﬂuence
on the forecast. Galbraith and Merrill (1996) describe a survey of executives that examines why
forecasts are changed. They ﬁnd that some executives change the forecast to inﬂuence the ﬁrm’s
stock price, while others are attempting to inﬂuence internal resource allocations. In some cases,
of course, they are simply trying to improve the forecast with better information. This is an inter-
esting article with good warnings for users and developers of forecasts. Oliva and Watson (2011)
discuss a case study for a high-tech manufacturer where the organization structure and forecasting
process led to poor forecasting performance and poor resource allocation decisions based on the
forecasts. Oliva and Watson (2009) further document how such poor alignment can be addressed
by creating a common information technology (IT) system that contains all relevant information
such as sales, forecasts, and assumptions as well as adopting what they call a consensus-forecasting
process where a series of meetings are held with relevant stakeholders in the organization to come
to an agreement on the forecast. In their case, and in most cases, the relevant stakeholders include
representatives from operations planning, marketing, and ﬁnance. Such a process is commonly a
part of what is known as the Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP) process. The S&OP process
is discussed further in Section 12.2.
3.8 Dealing with Special Classes of Individual Items
The procedures discussed to this stage in the chapter should be of use for a major portion of the
items handled by a typical organization. However, there are special classes of items where caution
must be exercised. The intention of this section is to provide some insights concerning each of the
several special classes. Additional information about forecasting style goods items will be covered
in Chapter 9.
3.8.1 Items with Limited History
Here, we ﬁnally address the issue of initialization of the exponential smoothing procedures of Sec-
tion 3.4, when there is insuﬃcient historical data to use the methods suggested earlier for obtaining
estimates of the parameters a, b, the Fs, and MSE. There are two reasons for an item having insuf-
ﬁcient historical data. First, the item may be a relatively new product (i.e., early in its product

Forecasting Models and Techniques
■
121
life cycle), as discussed in Section 2.5.1. Second, when a new control system is introduced in an
organization, there may simply not be enough historical records even though the item has had sales
for a considerable period of time.
For an item with insuﬃcient history, a knowledgeable individual (likely a member of the
judgmental input committee) should estimate
1. Total demand in the ﬁrst year
2. Total demand in the second year
3. Seasonal pattern (if appropriate)
The ﬁrst two give an estimate of the level and trend. The third most likely would be provided by
saying that the item’s seasonal behavior should be the same as an existing individual item or group
of items.
It is important to provide a graph of the implied 2-year demand pattern so that adjustments can
be made, if necessary. Higher-than-normal smoothing should be used in the ﬁrst several periods
because of the relative inaccuracy of the initial estimates of the parameters.
The MSE (or σ) of an item with insuﬃcient history is estimated using an empirical relationship
between σ and the demand level, a, found to hold for more established items in the same inventory
population. In particular, a relationship that has been observed to give a reasonable ﬁt for many
organizations is of the form
σ1 = c1ac2
(3.72)
or equivalently
log σ1 = log c1 + c2 log a
(3.73)
where c1 and c2 are regression coeﬃcients typically with 0.5 < c2 < 1. The relationship of
Equation 3.73 will plot as a straight line on log–log graph paper.
Sometimes, Equation 3.72 is modiﬁed to estimate the standard deviation on a dollar basis
σ1v = c1(av)c2
(3.74)
where v is the unit variable cost of an item.
This relationship can be used on an on-going basis as needed to estimate the standard devi-
ation of any C items because these items may not be statistically forecasted, and therefore their
errors would not be recorded. Relationships other than Equation 3.72 have been suggested in the
literature. See, for example, Hausman and Kirby (1970), Stevens (1974), Shore (1995, 1998),
and Kurawarwala and Matsuo (1996). The papers by Shore provide a simple procedure for
approximating the distribution when data are extremely limited.
3.8.1.1 Illustration
Consider a new item with an estimated demand of 300 units per year. The person responsible
for forecasting this item used several hundred other items similar to this one to ﬁnd c1 and c2 by
regression, with the following result:
σ1 = 1.04(D/12)0.65
where D is the annual demand. Therefore, the initial estimate of σ1 is

122
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
σ1 = 1.04(300/12)0.65 = 8.43 units
and the initial estimate of MSE is
MSE = (8.43)2 = 71.02
3.8.2 Intermittent and Erratic Demand
The exponential smoothing forecast methods described earlier have been found to be ineﬀective
where transactions (not necessarily unit sized) occur on a somewhat infrequent basis. To illustrate
this point, let us consider a particularly simple situation where only transactions of a single size j
occur exactly every n periods of time. Suppose that simple exponential smoothing (level only) is
used and the updating is done every unit period. Note that immediately after a demand transaction
occurs, the forecast will exceed the average demand per period, because of the weight given to
the last demand of size j. Because there is zero demand for the next n −1 periods, the forecast
decreases thereafter, dropping below the average demand by the end of the cycle. In other words,
for a deterministic demand pattern, exponential smoothing produces a sawtooth-type forecast.
This illustration is a symptom of an undesirable performance of exponential smoothing under
the more general situation of infrequent transactions, not necessarily all of the same size. For such a
situation, it is preferable to forecast two separate components of the demand process—namely, the
time between consecutive transactions and the magnitude of individual transactions. That is, we let
xt = ytzt
(3.75)
where
yt =

1 if a transaction occurs
0 otherwise
and zt is the size of the transaction.
If we deﬁne a quantity n as the number of periods between transactions and if demands in
separate periods are considered to be independent, then, the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a
transaction in a period can be considered as a Bernoulli process with the probability of occurrence
being 1/n. That is
Pr{yt = 1} = 1/n
and
Pr{yt = 0} = 1 −1/n
Within this framework and assuming that transaction sizes are normally distributed,
Croston (1972) recommends the following reasonable updating procedure. If xt = 0 (i.e., no
demand occurs),
1. Transaction size estimates are not updated, that is, ˆzt = ˆzt−1
2. ˆnt = ˆnt−1
If xt > 0 (i.e., a transaction occurs),
1. ˆzt = αxt + (1 −α)ˆzt−1
2. ˆnt = αnt + (1 −α)ˆnt−1

Forecasting Models and Techniques
■
123
where
nt = number of periods since the last transaction
ˆnt = estimated value of n at the end of period t
ˆzt = estimate, at the end of period t, of the average transaction size
Croston argues that forecasts for replenishment purposes will usually be needed immediately
after a transaction. He shows that the forecast at that time, namely,
ˆzt/ˆnt
is preferable to that obtained by simple exponential smoothing for two reasons:
1. It is unbiased, whereas the simple smoothing forecast is not.
2. It has a lower variance than does the simple smoothing forecast.
However, Croston warns that the infrequent updating (only when a transaction occurs) introduces
a marked lag in responding to actual changes in the underlying parameters. Therefore, he rightfully
stresses the importance of control signals to identify deviations.
A key quantity to use in establishing the safety stock for an intermittently demanded item is
MSE(z), the mean square error of the sizes of nonzero-sized transactions. This quantity is only
updated each time a transaction occurs. The updating equation is of the form
New MSE(z) = ω(xt −ˆzt−1)2 + (1 −ω)Old MSE(z)
xt > 0
(3.76)
In establishing the safety stock, one must also take into account of the fact that there is a nonzero
chance of no transaction occurring in a period. Willemain et al. (1994) show that Croston’s method
is superior to exponential smoothing, and also note that the lognormal distribution is preferable to
the normal for transaction sizes. Further discussion on Croston’s method can be found in Hynd-
man et al. (2008). Johnston (1980) suggests an alternate method for directly estimating σ1 for an
intermittent demand item. See also Wright (1986), Johnston (1993), Johnston and Boylan (1994,
1996), Anderson (1994), Walton (1994), and Syntetos and Boylan (2005).
An item is said to have an erratic demand pattern if the variability is large relative to the
mean. Brown (1977) operationalizes this by saying that demand is erratic when ˆσ1 > ˆa where ˆσ is
obtained by a ﬁt to history, as in Section 3.5.1. In such a case, he suggests restricting the underlying
model to the case of only a level and a random component. See also Muir (1980), Watson (1987),
and Willemain (2004).
3.8.3 Replacement or Service Parts
In the case of replacement or service parts, we have more information than is usually available
in a demand-forecasting situation. In particular, the requirements for replacement parts depend
on the failure rate of operating equipment, which, in turn, depends on the time stream of the
introduction of new (or repaired) pieces of equipment as well as the distribution of the service life
of the equipment. Although it is relatively easy to state the above relationship, it is quite another
thing to operationalize it. In particular, the mathematics become extremely involved. Also, it is
neither easy to maintain the required records nor to estimate the service-life distribution. Keilson
and Kubat (1984) develop tractable results for the special case where new equipment is introduced

124
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
according to a time-varying Poisson distribution and failures also occur according to a Poisson
process. A closely related problem is the forecasting of the returns of rented items or containers
(e.g., soft drink bottles, beer kegs, etc.). See Goh and Varaprasad (1986), Kelle and Silver (1989),
Fleischmann et al. (1997), Guide and Wassenhove (2001), and the references in Section 11.5.
3.8.4 Terminal Demand
Here, we are dealing with exactly the opposite situation from that in Section 3.8.1. Now, we are
nearing the end of the life cycle of the item. It has been empirically observed (see, e.g., Brown
et al. 1981; Fortuin 1980) that in the terminal phase of demand, the pattern tends to decrease
geometrically with time. That is, the demand in period t + 1 is a constant fraction (f ) of the
demand in period t. Mathematically, we then have
xt+1 = fxt
or, more generally,
xt = f tx0
t = 0, 1, 2, . . .
(3.77)
In this last equation, the time origin has been placed at the beginning of, or somewhere during,
the terminal phase of the pattern.
Taking the logarithms of Equation 3.77 reveals that
log xt = t log f + log x0
(3.78)
Thus, a plot of xt versus t on a semilogarithmic graph should produce a straight line with
slope log f . Such a line can be ﬁt by standard regression techniques. Brown (1981) develops an
expression for the variance of an extrapolated forecast into the future as a function of the residual
variance of the historical ﬁt, the number of historical data points used in the ﬁt, and how far into
the future the projection is made.
If the origin is placed at the current period, and the current level is x0, then, an estimate of the
all-time future requirements using Equation 3.77 is given by
ATR =
∞

τ=1
ˆx0,τ
=
∞

τ=1
f τx0 =
f
1 −f x0
(3.79)
3.8.4.1 Illustration
Consider a particular spare part for a late-model car. Suppose that the demand has begun dropping
oﬀgeometrically with a factor f = 0.81 and the demand level in the current year is 115 units.
From Equation 3.79, the all-time future requirements are estimated to be
ATR = 0.81
0.19(115) ≈490 units

3.9 Assessing Forecasting Procedures: Tactics and Strategy
In this section, we ﬁrst address a tactical question—namely, measuring and comparing the statistical
accuracy of diﬀerent forecasting procedures. Then, we return to the issues of a more strategic
nature.
3.9.1 Statistical Accuracy of Forecasts
The ﬁrst point to note is that there are several possible measures of forecast accuracy—for example,
the MSE, the MAD, the sample variance, the sample bias, any of these normalized by the mean
demand level, and so forth. No single measure is universally best. In fact, forecast accuracy is
only a surrogate for overall production/inventory system performance (encompassing the uses of
the forecasts). The surrogate is usually justiﬁed in terms of keeping the evaluation procedure of a
manageable size. We return to this point in Section 3.9.2.
Besides the choice of several possible statistical measures of forecast accuracy, there is the added
problem of not even being able to make valid statistical claims about the relative sizes of the same
measure achieved by two diﬀerent forecasting procedures. The reason for this is that the two series
of forecast errors are correlated to an unknown extent. (See Peterson 1969.)
To complicate matters, it can be shown that a linear combination of forecasts from two or more
procedures can outperform all of those individual procedures. Some research has even shown that
attempts to ﬁnd optimal weights when combining diﬀerent forecasts are not worth the eﬀort. A
simple average provides very good results. (See Kang 1986.) In theory, the best combination of
procedures depends on the value of the measure of variability (e.g., the MSE) for each individual
procedure, as well as the correlation between the results of the procedures. However, it is diﬃcult
to accurately estimate these quantities. Hence, if combinations of forecasts are to be considered, we
recommend trying combinations of only two at a time, and starting with equal weights. References
on combinations of forecasts include Bates and Granger (1969), Dickinson (1975), Lewis (1978),
Makridakis and Winkler (1983), Armstrong (1984, 2001a), Ashton and Ashton (1985), Flores
and Whybark (1986), Georgoﬀand Murdick (1986), Lawrence et al. (1986), Gupta and Wilton
(1987), Bunn (1988), Sanders and Ritzman (1989), Schmittlein et al. (1990), and Timmermann
(2006).
In developing the relative measures of accuracy, it is crucial to use an ex-ante, as opposed to an
ex-post, testing procedure. In an ex-post approach, the forecast model and updating procedure are
tested on the same data from which the model form or smoothing constant values were selected.
In contrast, the ex-ante method involves testing with an entirely diﬀerent set of data. This is usu-
ally accomplished by using a ﬁrst part of the historical information for ﬁtting purposes, and the
remaining portion for testing. Performance on ex-post tests can be a very poor indicator of ex-ante
performance, and it is the latter that is of practical interest. See Fildes and Howell (1979), and
Makridakis (1990) for further discussion and references.
Numerous tests that have measured the statistical accuracy of diﬀerent forecasting proce-
dures have been reported in the literature. However, of primary interest is the comprehensive
study undertaken by Makridakis et al. (1982), subsequently followed by Makridakis et al. (1993)
and Makridakis and Hibon (2000). It involved some 1,001 time series including both micro- and
macrolevel data as well as monthly, quarterly, and annual forecast update intervals. All the common
statistical forecasting procedures (from very simple to quite complex) were tested, and a number of
measures of statistical accuracy were obtained for each combination of procedure and time series.
Some of the salient ﬁndings were the following:

126
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
1. Signiﬁcant diﬀerences in forecast accuracy occurred as a function of the micro-
/macroclassiﬁcation. On microdata (the case in individual-item forecasting), the relatively
simple methods did much better than the statistically sophisticated methods. The latter were
better, however, for macrodata (the case for medium or even longer-term forecasting).
2. For horizons of 1–6 periods ahead, simple exponential smoothing, Holt and Brown trend
procedures, and the Winters method performed well. For horizons of 7 or more peri-
ods, a more complicated procedure, developed by Lewandowski (1979), showed the best
performance.
3. Deseasonalization of the data by the ratio to moving average method (which we suggested in
Section 3.4.4) did as well as much more sophisticated deseasonalization procedures.
4. Adaptive methods did not outperform nonadaptive methods.
5. A simple average of six of the simpler statistical methods did somewhat better than any of
the individual methods, and also outperformed a combination of the methods that in theory
was supposed to give the best results.
6. In general, sophisticated methods did not produce more accurate results than did the simpler
methods.
In summary, the results of this major international study lend strong support to the forecasting
procedures that we have advocated in this chapter. See also Fildes (1989) and Armstrong (2001b).
3.9.2 Some Issues of a More Strategic Nature
As Fildes (1979) points out, two questions dominate any assessment of a forecasting procedure.
First, are the results statistically satisfactory (the topic covered in Section 3.9.1)? Second, will the
procedure, once developed, be used and perform in a cost-eﬀective fashion? In Fildes’s words, “it
is the latter that is often of more concern to the practicing forecaster.” This view is shared by
the authors of the Study Guide for the Certiﬁcation Program of the American Production and
Inventory Control Society (see Blagg et al. 1980):
Forecasting is not done for its own sake; it is meaningful only as it relates to and sup-
ports decision making within the production system. Hence, managerial considerations
regarding cost, eﬀectiveness, and appropriateness of the forecasting function must be a
part of the domain of forecasting.
Earlier, we mentioned that it has often been advocated that the statistical accuracy of a forecast-
ing method should be used as a surrogate for the portion of system costs associated with forecast
errors. Unfortunately, studies have shown that traditional error measures do not necessarily relate
to overall system costs. Thus, where possible, a choice between forecasting procedures should be
based partly on a comparative simulation test of system costs using historical data or a trial run on
new data.
Closely related to this point is the desirable property of robustness (Fildes 1979). The choice
of a particular demand model and updating procedure should again be at least partially based
on an insensitivity to the data quality, missing observations, outliers, and so forth. We hope that
the suggestions made in Section 3.6 would beneﬁt any selected procedure from a standpoint of
robustness.
A study by Adam and Ebert (1976) (see also Hogarth and Makridakis 1981) compares objective
(statistical model) forecasts with judgmental forecasts. Interestingly enough, the objective forecasts,

Forecasting Models and Techniques
■
127
on the average, outperformed the subjective forecasts. However, Bunn and Wright (1991) note that
expert, informed judgmental forecasts have higher quality than many researchers have previously
asserted. Therefore, it is essential to solicit human input to the forecasting process. To have mean-
ingful subjective input, the manager must be able to understand the underlying assumptions and
general idea of the statistical model. This is an important reason for why we have placed so much
emphasis on the relatively simple exponential smoothing procedures. Moreover, in Chapters 10
and 15, where there will be a more explicit dependence of demand among diﬀerent SKUs (multi-
echelon inventory systems and multistage production processes), we will emphasize a diﬀerent type
of forecasting that involves the explosion of known future usage.
Related to the usefulness of a forecasting system, Makridakis and Wheelwright (1979) list a
number of potential organizational blocks to improved forecasting. Of speciﬁc interest here are
(1) bias and (2) credibility and communication. By bias, we mean that in many organizations,
there is incentive for a forecast to not represent the most likely outcome but, instead, to serve as
a self-fulﬁlling goal. For example, sales personnel may deliberately provide low forecasts if they
are rewarded for exceeding the target levels based, at least in part, on the forecasted values. By
credibility, we mean that the forecasts may lack relevance, or appear to lack relevance, which often
is a result of a lack of proper communication between the forecast analyst and the decision maker.
Additional information is provided by Sanders and Manrodt (1994, 2003b) who ﬁnd that the lack
of relevant data and low organizational support are the primary reasons that formal methods are
not used as extensively in U.S. corporations.
In conclusion, we recall the experience of one of the authors who was once asked to mediate
between competing forecasting groups at a large international corporation. Each group was obvi-
ously very sophisticated in mathematical time-series analysis and very clever in coaxing the most
obscure of patterns out of historical data through spectral analysis. However, none of the nine
highly trained mathematician forecasters involved had ever really closely examined a retail outlet
or wholesaler through which the products that they forecasted were being sold. To most of them,
products were characterized by amplitudes and phase angles.
Top managers for their part were somewhat intimidated by all the apparent sophistication
(as was the author initially). Little collaboration existed between the users and the producers
of forecasts. Both management and analysts ignored the fact that one really cannot foretell the
future with great accuracy. Tactics without any overall strategy prevailed. On closer examination, it
became clear that the management was not taking the mathematicians’ forecasts seriously because
they did not understand how they were being generated. The problem that brought matters to
a head was the entrance of an aggressive competitor into the market who claimed through mas-
sive advertising that the company’s basic product concept was technologically obsolete. It took
for top management several weeks to react because they were unable to determine the extent
of the impact on their sales until wholesalers and retailers started to refuse previously planned
shipments.
Eventually the situation was resolved as follows. Instead of trying to foretell the future, top
management agreed to set up better procedures that would allow the company to quickly react to
forecast errors as soon as their magnitude was determined. This involved a basic change in man-
agement philosophy. No longer were forecast errors a surprise event. They were fully anticipated,
and everyone in the decision hierarchy prepared contingency plans in response. All agreed that it
was at least equally as important to develop techniques for responding to errors, as it was to try
to measure and predict them. In the process, six of the high-powered time-series analysts were laid
oﬀ, resulting in a substantial reduction of overall costs associated with forecasting as well as in a
better forecasting strategy.

Southern Consolidated manufactures gas turbines. Some of the parts are bought from out-
side, while the important ones are made in the company’s plant. CZ-43 is an important
part that wears out in approximately 2 years and has to be replaced. This means CZ-43
has to be manufactured not only to meet demand at the assembly line but also to satisfy its
demand as a spare part. The gas turbine was ﬁrst sold in 2002 and the demand for CZ-43
for 2002–2015 is given below. Forecast the total demand for CZ-43 for 2016.

a. Use a 2-week moving average to forecast the incidents in each of weeks 7 and 10. Also
compute the MSE based on the incidents and forecasts for periods 1–6. To initialize,
assume x−1 = x0 = 100.
b. Detective Bick Melker suggests the use of simple (single) exponential smoothing with
α = 0.1. Use such a procedure to develop forecasts of incidents in weeks 7 and 10 for
Hill Road. Initialize with ˆa0 = 100. Also compute the MSE and MAD.
c. Without redoing all the computations, what would be the forecast of incidents in week 7
using exponential smoothing if ˆa0 were 90 instead of 100?

Brown’s updating equations, developed from discounted least squares, for the case of a trend
model are actually given by

Show that these two equations are equivalent to Equations 3.32 and 3.33.

For purposes of calculating the safety stock of a particular item, we are interested in having
an estimate of the MAD or MSE of forecast errors. No historical forecasts are available,
but historical monthly demand data for 3 years are available. An analyst on your staﬀhas
proposed using the MAD with the following procedure for estimating it:
Step 1 Plot the 3 years of data.
Step 2 Fit the best straight line to it (either by eye or through a statistical ﬁt).
Step 3 For each month ﬁnd the absolute deviation
|ϵt| = |xt −˜xt|
where xt is the actual demand in month t and ˜xt is the value read oﬀthe straight line
(found in Step 2) at month t.
Step 4 MAD = average value of |ϵt| over the 36 months.
a. Discuss why the MAD found by the above procedure might be lower than that actually
achievable by statistical forecasting.
b. Discuss why the MAD found by the above procedure might be substantially higher than
that actually achievable by a forecasting procedure. Hint: The use of diagrams may be
helpful.
c. Why might the MSE be a better choice?

Suppose you have been hired by a company to install a forecasting system for about

times of the year), our competitor’s actions, etc.”

3A.2 Relationship between MAD and Standard Deviation for Unbiased
Forecasts
Let MAD represent mean absolute deviation of an unbiased forecast and let σ represent the stan-
dard deviation of forecast errors (also for an unbiased forecast). When forecast errors are normally
distributed, the following relationship holds:
π
2 MAD = σ
To derive this relationship, note that the unbiased forecast would be mean demand, ˆx. So, mean
absolute deviation can be expressed as
MAD =

(ˆx −x0)fx(x0)dx0 +

REPLENISHMENT
SYSTEMS FOR
MANAGING
INDIVIDUAL ITEM
INVENTORIES WITHIN
A FIRM
In the ﬁrst part of this book, we have laid groundwork by specifying the environment, goals, con-
straints, relevant costs, and forecast inputs of production/inventory decisions. Now, we turn our
attention to the detailed logic for short-range decision making in situations of a strictly inventory
(i.e., nonproduction) nature. We are concerned primarily with individual items or SKUs. However,
as discussed in Chapter 2, aggregate considerations will often still play a crucial role by examining
the consequences across a population of inventoried items of using diﬀerent values of certain pol-
icy parameters. Management can select the aggregate operating point on an exchange curve, thus
implying values of the parameters that are to be used in the item by item decision rules.
Within this part of the book, we deal with the so-called B items, which, as we have seen earlier,
comprise the majority of items in a typical inventory situation. Unlike for C items, which will
be handled in Section III, there are usually signiﬁcant savings to be derived from the use of a
reasonably sophisticated control system. On the other hand, the potential savings per item are not
as high as those for individual A items. The combination of these two factors suggests the use of a
hybrid system that combines the relative advantages of human and computer. The management-
by-exception control system that we describe is reasonably sophisticated, and usually automated,
but requires human intervention on a relatively infrequent basis. Such automated control systems,
when applied in practice, have resulted in signiﬁcant improvements in the control of B items.

Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
In Chapter 4, we ﬁrst answer the question of how much to replenish in the context of an
approximately level demand pattern. Next, in Chapter 5, we consider the more general situation of
a demand pattern, such as that seen with seasonal items, where the mean or forecast demand
changes appreciably with time. This more general case considerably complicates the analysis.
Therefore, the suggested decision system is based on a reasonable heuristic decision rule.
Chapter 6 is concerned, for the most part, with the situation where the average demand rate
stays approximately level with time, but there is a random component present. That is, the mean
or forecast demand stays constant or changes slowly with time, but there deﬁnitely are appreciable
forecast errors. When demand is known only in a probabilistic sense, two additional questions
must be answered: “How often should we review the stock status?” and “When should we place a
replenishment order?”
All the material in Chapters 4 through 6 ignores the possible beneﬁts of coordinating the
replenishments of two or more items. We return to this important topic in Chapters 10 and 11 of
Section IV.

Chapter 4
Order Quantities When
Demand Is Approximately
Level
In this chapter, we address the question of how large a replenishment quantity to use for a single
item when conditions are rather stable (any changes in parameters occur slowly over time), and
there is relatively little or no uncertainty concerning the level of demand. This simpliﬁed situa-
tion is a reasonable approximation of reality on certain occasions. More important, however, the
results obtained turn out to be major components of the decision systems when parameters change
with time, demand is probabilistic or multiple items are managed jointly. In addition, the goal is
not to have a completely automated replenishment system, but to provide decision support to a
planner. This is essential for several reasons, including (1) giving the planner the ability to incor-
porate factors not included in the underlying mathematical model, and (2) cultivating a sense of
accountability and responsibility on the part of the decision makers.
In Section 4.1, we discuss the rather severe assumptions needed to derive the economic order
quantity (EOQ). This is followed in Section 4.2 by the actual derivation. In Section 4.3, we show
that the total relevant costs are not seriously aﬀected by somewhat large deviations of the replen-
ishment quantity away from the minimizing value. This robust property of the EOQ is important
from an operational standpoint as there are many factors in practice that may make a quantity
other than the calculated EOQ convenient. Section 4.4 introduces a tabular aid that groups items
into broad categories to make implementation easier, particularly in a noncomputerized system.
The important situation of quantity discounts is handled in Section 4.5. This is followed, in Sec-
tion 4.6, by a discussion of the eﬀects of inﬂation on the order quantity. Section 4.7 deals with
several types of limitations on replenishment quantities ignored in the earlier development of the
EOQ. In Section 4.8, we address the production situation in which the entire replenishment batch
does not arrive at one time. Other important factors in selecting the best reorder quantity are
included in Section 4.9. Finally, the derivation of the basic EOQ includes two cost parameters: (1)
the carrying charge r, and (2) the ﬁxed cost per replenishment A. As discussed in Chapter 2, one
or both of the values of these parameters may be explicitly evaluated or implicitly speciﬁed. They
145

■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
may be implicitly speciﬁed by looking at the aggregate consequences of using diﬀerent values of r
(or A/r), and then selecting a suitable aggregate operating point, which implies an r (or A/r) value.
Section 4.10 shows how to develop the exchange curves, a crucial step in this implicit approach.
4.1 Assumptions Leading to the Basic EOQ
First, we will state the assumptions. Some of these assumptions are quite strong and may initially
appear to be quite limiting but, as we will see, the EOQ forms an important building block in
the majority of decision systems that we advocate. In addition, Zheng (1992) has shown that the
fractional cost penalty of using the EOQ instead of a more complex, but optimal, order quantity
when demand is random is less than 1/8, and is typically much smaller. (Axsäter (1996) has shown
that the penalty is less than 11.8%.) Further discussion will be directed to these points later in this
chapter and in the subsequent chapters.
1. The demand rate is constant and deterministic.
2. The order quantity need not be an integral number of units, and there are no minimum or
maximum restrictions on its size.
3. The unit variable cost does not depend on the replenishment quantity; in particular, there
are no discounts in either the unit purchase cost or the unit transportation cost.
4. The cost factors do not change appreciably with time; in particular, inﬂation is at a low level.
5. The item is treated entirely independently of other items; that is, beneﬁts from joint review
or replenishment do not exist or are simply ignored.
6. The replenishment lead time is of zero duration; as we will see in Section 4.9.1, extension to
a deterministic, nonzero replenishment lead time creates no problem.
7. No shortages are allowed.
8. The entire order quantity is delivered at the same time.
9. The planning horizon is very long. In other words, we assume that all the parameters will
continue at the same values for a long time.
All these assumptions will be relaxed later in this chapter, or elsewhere in the book. Situations
where the demand rate changes appreciably with time (i.e., the ﬁrst assumption is violated) will
be treated in Chapters 5 and 8. Problem 4.5 deals with the case in which shortages are allowed.
(See also Montgomery et al. (1973) and Moon and Gallego (1994) for a treatment of the case in
which there is a mixture of lost sales and backorders. More recently, Bijvank and Vis (2011) review
inventory models with lost sales and backordering.) We often refer to “changing the givens,” mean-
ing that the static version of the problem may not be appropriate over time. Rather, some of the
assumptions, costs, or other data may, and should, change. For example, in this chapter, we gen-
erally assume that the setup cost, A, is given. Setup reduction eﬀorts, however, may signiﬁcantly
reduce this value, yielding enormous beneﬁts. Likewise, supplier portals, electronic data inter-
change (EDI), or other technological infrastructure may reduce the ﬁxed cost of ordering from
suppliers, creating new optimal order quantities and signiﬁcantly lower costs. Sometimes, it is
possible to negotiate with suppliers to reduce the minimum order size required for a quantity dis-
count, or it may be possible to negotiate with transportation ﬁrms to use smaller trucks to reduce
the minimum order size.*
* See Moinzadeh et al. (1997) for a discussion of the impact on traﬃc of small lot sizes.

Order Quantities When Demand Is Approximately Level

The traditional approach to the EOQ has been to optimize the order quantity without ques-
tioning the input data. The “changing the givens” approach recognizes the possibility of changing
the parameters. In many cases, the most powerful beneﬁt to the ﬁrm is through lowering the setup
cost, rather than optimizing the order quantity. We argue, however, that the best approach is to ini-
tially optimize the order quantity given the parameters as they are, and then devote management
(and labor) eﬀort to changing the givens. A fastener manufacturer that supplies U.S. automo-
tive assemblers had setup times on some machines that took from 12 to 20 hours. One of the
authors worked as a consultant to this ﬁrm and developed (nearly) optimal order quantities. At
the same time, however, factory supervisors and operators were working hard to lower the setup
times. The use of the new order quantities would lower costs, but not nearly as much as lower
setup times would. Unfortunately, the setup reduction process was very slow, and the ﬁrm would
have sacriﬁced savings if management had delayed changing order quantities until this process was
ﬁnished. As setup times decrease, new order quantities should be calculated. Numerous authors
have addressed these issues. See, for instance, Porteus (1985, 1986a,b), Silver (1992), Hong et al.
(1996), Spence and Porteus (1987), Van Beek and Van Putten (1987), Freeland et al. (1990), Neves
(1992), Gallego and Moon (1995), Bourland et al. (1996), Van der Duyn Schouten et al. (1994),
and Freimer et al. (2006). We will discuss these issues further in the context of manufacturing
in Section IV.
4.2 Derivation of the EOQ
In determining the appropriate order quantity, we use the criterion of minimization of total relevant
costs; relevant in the sense that they are truly aﬀected by the choice of the order quantity. We
emphasize that in some situations, there may be certain, perhaps intangible, relevant costs that
are not included in the model to be discussed. This is one of the reasons we mention the need
for a manual override capability. In addition, cost minimization need not be the only appropriate
criterion. For example, Buzacott and Zhang (2004) investigate how inventory decisions are aﬀected
by the current ﬁnancial state of the ﬁrm. Singhal (1988) also closely examines the connection to
the ﬁnancial state of the ﬁrm and argues that inventories are risky, and thus increase the ﬁrm’s
opportunity cost of capital. Other work of interest includes Gerchak and Wang (1994b), which
investigates the issue of demand changing as a result of inventory decisions. More recently, Buzacott
(2013) reﬂects further on similar issues.
Returning to the consideration of costs, as discussed in Chapter 2, there are ﬁve fundamental
categories of costs:
1. Basic production or purchase costs
2. Inventory carrying costs
3. Costs of insuﬃcient capacity in the short run
4. Control system costs
5. Costs of changing work force sizes and production rates
The ﬁfth category is not relevant for the item-by-item control we are considering here. Also,
given that we are restricting our attention to a particular type of control system (an order quan-
tity system), the control system costs are not inﬂuenced by the exact value of the order quantity.
Therefore, they need not be taken into account when selecting the value of the order quantity.
Because of the deterministic nature of the demand, the only cost relevant to the third category
would be that which is caused by the decision maker deliberately choosing to run short of the

inventory before making a replenishment. For now, we ignore the possibility of allowing planned
shortages.
Finally, we are left with only the ﬁrst two types of costs being relevant to the economic selection
of the replenishment quantity.
Before proceeding further, let us introduce some notation:
Q = the replenishment order quantity, in units.
D = the demand rate of the item, in units/unit time.
T = the time between placement (and receipt) of replenishment orders.
A = the ﬁxed cost component (independent of the magnitude of the replenishment
quantity) incurred with each replenishment, in dollars. (This cost component has
been discussed at length in Chapter 2.)
v = the unit variable cost of the item. This is not the selling price of the item, but rather
its value (immediately after the replenishment operation now under consideration)
in terms of raw materials and value added through processing and assembly opera-
tions. We often think of v as the value of the item on the shelf, including material
handling. The dimensions are $/unit.
r = the carrying charge, the cost of having one dollar of the item tied up in the inven-
tory for a unit time interval (normally 1 year); that is, the dimensions are $/$/unit
time. (Again, this cost component was discussed at length in Chapter 2.)
TRC(Q) = the total relevant costs per unit time, that is, the sum of those costs per unit time
that can be inﬂuenced by the order quantity Q. The dimensions are $/unit time.
Because the parameters involved are assumed not to change with time, it is reasonable (and,
indeed, mathematically optimal) to think in terms of using the same order quantity, Q, each time
that a replenishment is made. Furthermore, because (1) demand is deterministic, (2) the replenish-
ment lead time is zero, and (3) we have chosen not to allow planned shortages, it is clear that each
replenishment will be made when the inventory level is exactly at zero. A graph of the inventory
level with time is shown in Figure 4.1.
Note that the time between replenishments is given by T = Q/D, the time to deplete Q units
at a rate of D units per unit time. (D is the usage over a period of time; normally 12 months
is used.) Therefore, the number of replenishments per unit time is D/Q. Say a three-ohm resis-
tor has the following data: D = 2,400 units per year and Q = 800 units. The time between
replenishments is 800/2,400 = 0.33 year, or 4 months. The number of replenishments per year
is 2,400/800 = 3. Associated with each of these is a replenishment cost given by A + Qv, where
one of our assumptions ensures that the unit variable cost v does not depend on Q. Therefore, the
replenishment costs per unit time (Cr) are given by
Cr = (A + Qv)D/Q
or
Cr = AD/Q + Dv
(4.1)
We can see that the second component in Equation 4.1 is independent of Q and, thus, can
have no eﬀect on the determination of the best Q value. (It represents the constant acquisition

cost of the item per unit time which cannot be aﬀected by the magnitude of the order quantity.)
Therefore, it will be neglected in future discussions.*
As discussed in Chapter 2, the common method of determining the costs of carrying the
inventory over a unit time period is through the relation
Cc = ¯Ivr
where ¯I is the average inventory level, in units. The average height of the sawtooth diagram of
Figure 4.1 is Q/2. Therefore,
Cc = Qvr/2
(4.2)
Combining Equations 4.1 and 4.2 and neglecting the Dv term, as discussed above, we have
that the total relevant costs per unit time are given by
TRC(Q) = AD/Q + Qvr/2
(4.3)
The two components of Equation 4.3 and their total are plotted for an illustrative numerical
example in Figure 4.2. We can see that the replenishment costs per unit time decrease as Q increases
(there are fewer replenishments), whereas the carrying costs increase with Q (a larger Q means a
larger average inventory). The sum of the two costs is a u-shaped function with a minimum that
can be found in a number of ways. (Adding the neglected Dv term would simply shift every point
on the total cost curve up by Dv; hence, the location of the minimum would not change.) One
* The Dv component will be of crucial interest in Section 4.5 where, in the case of quantity discounts, v depends
on Q.

Equation 4.4 deﬁnes the EOQ also known as the Wilson lot size. This is one of the earliest
and most well-known results of inventory theory (see, e.g., Harris (1913), reprinted as Harris
(1990), and Erlenkotter (1990)). Note that Equation 4.4 illustrates, among other points, that
the preferred order quantity goes up as the square root of demand, rather than being directly
proportional to the D value. Substituting the square root expression for the EOQ in Equation 4.4
back into Equation 4.3, we ﬁnd that the two cost components are equal at the EOQ and we obtain
the simple and useful result:
TRC(EOQ) =
√
2ADvr
(4.5)

151
It should be emphasized that the equality of the two cost components (Qvr/2 and AD/Q) at
the point where their sum is minimized is a very special property of the particular cost functions
considered here; it certainly does not hold in general.
The EOQ minimizes the total relevant costs under a given set of circumstances. It may in fact
be more appropriate to ﬁrst ﬁnd ways of driving down the ﬁxed cost A or the carrying charge r.
This would lower the entire total cost curve in Figure 4.2. Also note from Equation 4.4 that a lower
A value will reduce the EOQ, and thus the average inventory level.
As noted earlier, for any given order quantity Q, the time between replenishments T = Q/D.
Using this relationship, we can write the total relevant costs for this model as a function of the time
supply T rather than the quantity. Substituting T = Q/D in Equation 4.3:
TRC(T) = A/T + DvrT/2
(4.6)
Using Equation 4.4, we ﬁnd the expression for the time between orders at the EOQ:
TEOQ = EOQ

(4.7)
A frequently used measure of inventory performance is the inventory turnover ratio, deﬁned as the
annual demand rate divided by the average inventory level. This ratio gives the number of times
the average inventory is sold or “turned” over some given time period. For any given quantity Q,
we calculate the inventory turnover ratio as
TR = D

(4.8)
At the EOQ, this inventory turnover ratio is

(4.9)
a result that is again seen to depend on the individual item factors D, v, and A. In particular,
all other things remaining constant, we see that the turnover ratio increases in proportion to the
square root of the demand rate, D.
4.2.1 Numerical Illustration
Consider a 3-ohm resistor used in the assembly of an automated processor of an x-ray ﬁlm. The
demand for this item has been relatively stable over time at a rate of 2,400 units/year. The unit
variable cost of the resistor is $0.40/unit and the ﬁxed cost per replenishment is estimated to be
$3.20. Suppose further that an r value of 0.24 $/$/year is appropriate to use. Then Equation 4.4
gives
EOQ =

2 × $3.20 × 2,400 units/year
$0.40/unit × 0.24$/$/year
= 400 units

152
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
Note that the dimensions appropriately cancel. This would not be the case, for example, if D and
r were deﬁned using diﬀerent time units (e.g., monthly demand with annual carrying charge).
Equation 4.5 reveals that the total relevant costs per year for the resistor are
TRC(EOQ) =

2 × $3.20 × 2,400 units/year × $0.40/unit × 0.24$/$/year
= $38.40/year
A check on the computations is provided by noting that substitution of Q = 400 units in Equation
4.3 also produces a total cost $38.40/year with each of the two terms equal at $19.20/year. If this
item has an order quantity of 4 months of time supply, or 800 units, we can evaluate the beneﬁt
of changing to the EOQ of 400. Substitution of Q = 800 into Equation 4.3 reveals that the total
relevant costs for the item are $48/year or some 25% higher than the costs incurred under the use
of the EOQ. Our experience indicates that savings of this magnitude are surprisingly common.
We can use other expressions developed in this section to evaluate the time between orders and
inventory turnover at the EOQ. The time between orders at the EOQ is given by Equation 4.7:
TEOQ =

2 × $3.20
2,400 units/year × $0.40/unit × 0.24$/$/year = 0.167 year, or 2 months
The inventory turnover ratio at the EOQ, following Equation 4.9, is
TREOQ =

2Dvr
A
=

2 × 2,400 units/year × $0.40/unit × 0.24$/$/year
$3.20
= 12 turns per year
Note that, at the EOQ, we are ordering a 2-month supply, but we are turning the average inventory
12 times per year or once every month. This is because the 2-month supply (Q = 400) is the
maximum inventory level while the average inventory level (used to calculate turns) is half this
quantity.
4.3 Sensitivity Analysis
An important property of the EOQ model is that total relevant costs are rather insensitive to
deviations from the optimal lot size given by the EOQ. Referring back to Figure 4.2, note that
the total cost curve is quite ﬂat in the neighborhood of the EOQ. This indicates that reasonable-
sized deviations from the EOQ will have little impact on the total relevant costs incurred. Here,
we explicitly examine the increase in the total relevant cost associated with choosing a lot size
other than the EOQ. Suppose we use a quantity Q′ that deviates from the EOQ according to the
following relation:
Q′ = (1 + p)EOQ
that is, 100p is the percentage deviation of Q′ from the EOQ. The percentage cost penalty (PCP)
for using Q′ instead of the EOQ is given by
PCP = TRC(Q′) −TRC(EOQ)
TRC(EOQ)

(4.10)
This expression is plotted in Figure 4.3. It is clear that even for values of p signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
from zero, the associated cost penalties are quite small.
To illustrate, consider the 3-ohm resistor that was used as a numerical example in Section 4.2.
The EOQ was found to be 400 units. Suppose that, instead, a value of 550 units was used; 550 is
1.375 × 400; thus, p = 0.375. Equation 4.10 or Figure 4.3 reveals that this 37.5% deviation from
optimal lot size results in a percentage increase in the total relevant costs of only 5.1%.
The insensitivity of total costs to the exact value of Q used has two important implications.
First, the use of an incorrect value of Q can result from inaccurate estimates of one or more of the
parameters D, A, v, and r that are used to calculate the EOQ.* The conclusion is that it is not worth
making accurate estimates of these input parameters if considerable eﬀort is involved; in most cases
inexpensive, crude estimates should suﬃce. Second, certain order quantities may have additional
appeal over the EOQ (for nonﬁnancial reasons or because of physical constraints, such as pallet
size or truckload size, which are not included in the basic EOQ model). The relative ﬂatness of
the total cost curve near the EOQ indicates that such values can be used provided that they are
reasonably close to the EOQ. This seemingly trivial result is one of the important cornerstones of
* It is worth noting that the cost penalty can actually be zero even if D, A, v, and r are inaccurately estimated, as long
as the resulting ratio AD/vr is correct. For example, if both D and v are overestimated by the same percentage,
the obtained EOQ will be the same as that resulting from the use of the correct D and v values.

operational inventory control. Without this ﬂexibility, implementable decision systems would be
much more diﬃcult to design. Detailed references on sensitivity analysis include Dobson (1988),
Juckler (1970), and Lowe and Schwarz (1983).
4.4 Implementation Aids
In spite of the widespread availability of inexpensive computers, our experience indicates that many
ﬁrms still manually control inventories. Many other ﬁrms use simple spreadsheet models, similar
to those described throughout this book. We now discuss a table that can facilitate implementation
because it groups multiple items into a few broad categories and can be developed easily on a
spreadsheet. While it is not too diﬃcult to develop a spreadsheet model to calculate the EOQ values
for a group of items, the approach here simpliﬁes implementation. Furthermore, while the focus
of this chapter is lot size decisions for a single item, the approach outlined in this section facilitates
the coordination of replenishment across multiple items, a topic that we address in Chapter 10.
The basic idea is that one value of the order quantity, typically expressed as a time supply, is
used over a range of one or more of the parameters. This makes it easier for an inventory manager
to track and control many items. There is an economic trade-oﬀinvolved, however. The larger
the number of ranges, the smaller the percentage cost penalties resulting from not using the exact
EOQ, but of course, the diﬃculty of compiling and using the tables increases with the number
of ranges involved. Further relevant discussion can be found in Chakravarty (1981), Crouch and
Oglesby (1978), Donaldson (1981), and Maxwell and Singh (1983).
To illustrate, let us consider a table usable for a set of items having the same values of A and r.
Suppose we deal with a group of items with A = $3.20 and r = 0.24 $/$/year. Furthermore, let
us assume that management feels that the replenishment quantity of any item should be restricted
to one of nine possible time supplies—namely, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 12 months.
Table 4.1 shows the months of supply to use as a function of the annual dollar usage (Dv) of the
item under consideration. A numerical illustration of the use of the table will be given shortly.
First, let us discuss how such a table is constructed.

The use of T months of supply is equivalent to the use of a quantity Q = DT/12, provided
D is measured in units/year that are the most common units. The use of Equation 4.3 gives
TRC(using T months) = DTvr
24
+ 12A
T
Now, consider two adjacent allowable values of the months of supply, call them T1 and T2.
Equating the total relevant costs using T1 months with that using T2 months, we obtain the value
of Dv at which we are indiﬀerent to using T1 and T2:
DT1vr
24
+ 12A
T1
= DT2vr
24

T2
This reduces to
(Dv)indiﬀerence = 288A
T1T2r
To illustrate, for the given values of A and r in the example, the indiﬀerence point for 1 month
and 2 months is
(Dv)indiﬀerence = 288 × 3.20
1 × 2 × 0.24 = $1,920/year
In a similar fashion, we can develop the rest of Table 4.1. It should be emphasized that more
than one value of A (and perhaps r) is likely to exist across a population of items. In such a case, a
set of tables would be required, one for each of a number of possible A (and, perhaps, r) values.
4.4.1 Numerical Illustration
Consider a product that is a box of 100 sheets of 8×11 in. stabilization paper. This product has
been observed to have a relatively constant demand rate (D) of 200 boxes/year. The unit variable
cost (v) is $16/box. Also assume that it is reasonable to use A = $3.20 and r = 0.24 $/$/year.
We have
Dv = $3,200/year
The table indicates that a 1-month supply should be used. Therefore,
Q = D
12 = 16.7
say, 17 boxes; that is, the paper should be replenished in orders of 17 boxes. (The exact EOQ for
this item is 18 boxes and the increase in costs for using 17 instead turns out to be only 0.3%.)
4.5 Quantity Discounts
A number of assumptions were made in Section 4.1 in order to derive the basic EOQ. One of the
most severe of these was that the unit variable cost v did not depend on the replenishment quantity.
In many practical situations, quantity discounts (on the basic purchase price or transportation

costs) exist, and taking advantage of these can result in substantial savings. (See e.g., Katz et al.
1994). We must be able to modify the EOQ to cope with these conditions.
Dolan (1987) provides a number of examples of quantity discounts, including pricing for
Sealed Air Corporation’s protection packaging, and prices for advertising in the Los Angeles Times.
See also Wilson (1993). These authors show that discount structures are quite varied. We restrict
our attention to the most common type of discount structure, namely, that of an “all-units” dis-
count. (One less common situation of an incremental discount structure has been treated by Hax
and Candea (1984) and Güder et al. (1994). See Benton and Park (1996) and Problem 4.24 also.)*
For the case of a single breakpoint, the unit variable cost in all-units discounts behaves as
follows:
Dv =

v0
0 ≤Q < Qb
v0(1 −d)
Qb ≤Q
(4.11)
where v0 is the basic unit cost without a discount and d is the discount expressed as a decimal,
given on all units when the replenishment quantity is equal to or greater than the breakpoint, Qb.
The total acquisition cost as a function of Q is shown in Figure 4.4. Note the discontinuity at the
breakpoint.
Now, it is essential to include the Dv component in a cost expression that is to be used for
determining the best replenishment quantity. Proceeding exactly as in Section 4.2, but retaining the
Dv component, we end up with two expressions for the total relevant costs, that is, for 0 ≤Q < Qb
(and thus no discount)
TRC(Q) = AD/Q + Qv0r/2 + Dv0
(4.12)
* Das (1988) presents a general discount structure that combines the features of all-units and incremental discounts.

Order Quantities When Demand Is Approximately Level
■
157
When Qb ≤Q, the discount d is applicable:
TRCd(Q) = AD/Q + Qv0(l −d)r/2 + Dv0(1 −d)
(4.13)
Although Equations 4.12 and 4.13 are valid for nonoverlapping regions of Q, it is useful, in
deriving an algorithm for ﬁnding the best Q, to compare the two cost expressions at the same value
of Q. A term-by-term comparison of the right-hand sides of the equations reveals that Equation
4.13 gives a lower TRC (Q) than does Equation 4.12 for the same Q. Therefore, if the lowest point
on the (4.13) curve is a valid one (i.e., at least as large as Qb), it must be the optimum, since it is
the lowest point on the lower curve.
Note that for nonnegative values of the discount d, the EOQ at the standard price v0 must
be lower than the EOQ calculated with the discount, although the diﬀerence in these quantities is
typically quite small. This means, if the EOQ with the discount is below Qb, the EOQ without
the discount must also be below Qb. In the usual situation where both EOQs (calculated with and
without the discount) are below the breakpoint, the decision of whether to go for the discount
hinges on a trade-oﬀbetween extra carrying costs versus a reduction in the acquisition costs (pri-
marily the reduction in the unit value, but also a beneﬁt from fewer replenishments per unit time).
Where the reduction in acquisition costs is larger than the extra carrying costs, the use of Qb is
preferable, as shown in part a of Figure 4.5. Where the extra carrying costs dominate, the best
solution is still the EOQ (with no discount), as shown in part b of Figure 4.5. However, there is
one other possibility—namely, that Qb is relatively low, and it may be attractive to go to the local
minimum (low point) on the curve of Equation 4.13. This is the EOQ (with discount) and this
case is shown in part c of Figure 4.5.
Taking advantage of the above property of Equation 4.13 being the lower curve, the steps of an
eﬃcient algorithm for ﬁnding the best value of Q are
Step 1 Compute the EOQ when the discount d is applicable, that is,
EOQ(d) =

2AD
v0(1 −d)r
Step 2 Compare EOQ(d) with Qb. If EOQ(d) ≥Qb, then EOQ(d) is the best order quantity
(case c of Figure 4.5). If EOQ(d) < Qb, go to Step 3.
Step 3 Evaluate
TRC(EOQ) =

2ADv0r + Dv0
and TRC(Qb), using Equation 4.13.
If TRC(EOQ) < TRC(Qb), the best order quantity is the EOQ without a discount (case b
of Figure 4.5), given by
EOQ(no discount) =

2AD
v0r
If TRC(EOQ) > TRC (Qb), the best order quantity is Qb (case a of Figure 4.5).
This logic can easily be extended to the case of several breakpoints with increasing discounts.
The best order quantity is always at a breakpoint or at a feasible EOQ. Kuzdrall and Britney (1982)
have used a somewhat diﬀerent approach that is useful when there is a large number of diﬀerent

Because of convenience in manufacturing and shipping, the supplier oﬀers a 2% discount on
any replenishment of 100 units or higher of a single item.
The computations are as follows:
4.5.2 Item A (An Illustration of Case a of Figure 4.5)
Step 1 EOQ (discount) = 19 units < 100 units.
Step 2 EOQ (discount) < Qb; therefore, go to Step 3.
Step 3
TRC(EOQ) =

2 × 1.50 × 416 × 14.20 × 0.24 + 416 × 14.20
= $5,972.42/year
TRC(Qb) = TRC(100) = 100 × 14.20 × 0.98 × 0.24
2
+ 1.50 × 416
100
+ 416 × 14.20 × 0.98
= $5,962.29/year
TRC(EOQ) > TRC (Qb). Therefore, the best order quantity to use is Qb, that is, 100 units.
4.5.3 Item B (An Illustration of Case b of Figure 4.5)
Step 1 EOQ (discount) = 21 units < 100 units.
Step 2 EOQ (discount) < Qb; therefore, go to Step 3.
Step 3
TRC(EOQ) =

2 × 1.50 × 104 × 3.10 × 0.24 + 104 × 3.10
= $337.64/year
TRC(Qb) = TRC(100) = 100 × 3.10 × 0.98 × 0.24
2
+ 1.50 × 104
100
+ 104 × 3.10 × 0.98
= $353.97/year
TRC(EOQ) < TRC (Qb). Therefore, use the EOQ without a discount; that is,
EOQ =

2 × 1.50 × 104
3.10 × 0.24
≈20 units

4.5.4 Item C (An Illustration of Case c of Figure 4.5)
Step 1
EOQ(discount) =

2 × 1.50 × 4,160
2.40 × 0.98 × 0.24 = 149 units > 100 units
Step 2 EOQ (discount) is greater than Qb. Therefore, the Q to use is 149 units (perhaps rounded
to 150 for convenience).
We also note that it is very easy to compute Equations 4.12 and 4.13 on a spreadsheet. Using
an IF statement to determine which formula to apply based on Q, the optimal value can be found
quickly. It is also possible to use Solver in an Excel spreadsheet to minimize the total cost. How-
ever, because the TRC functions (illustrated in Figure 4.5) in general have more than one local
minimum, use several starting values in Solver to avoid ﬁnding just a local minimum.
In an all-units discount situation, a possible strategy is to buy Qb units to achieve the discount;
then, dispose of some of the units, at some unit cost (or revenue), to reduce inventory carrying
costs. An application of this philosophy is the case where an entire car of a train is reserved, but
not completely ﬁlled, by a shipment. Sethi (1984) has analyzed this more general situation.
Much work has been done to further our knowledge of quantity discount situations. Dolan
(1987) examines motivations for suppliers to oﬀer discounts and provides several in-depth exam-
ples. Monahan (1984), Lal and Staelin (1984), Rosenblatt and Lee (1985), Lee (1986), Dada and
Srikanth (1987), Kim and Hwang (1988), Min (1991), Parlar and Wang (1994), and Lu (1995)
address the quantity discount problem from the supplier’s perspective. For various pricing and dis-
count structures, the supplier’s own order quantity and the discounts it oﬀers are determined. Das
(1984) provides a simple solution for the problem when a premium is charged for bulk purchases.
This work is particularly applicable in developing countries. Grant (1993) describes a simple pro-
gram for quantity discount decisions used at a small JIT manufacturer who was biased against
large quantities, and therefore against taking any quantity discounts. Finally, Abad (1988) exam-
ines the all-units discount oﬀered to a retailer whose demand is a function of the price the retailer
charges. An algorithm for ﬁnding the optimal order quantity and price is given. See also Burwell
et al. (1990), Weng and Wong (1993), Weng (1995a,b), Lu and Posner (1994), Kim (1995), and
Carlson et al. (1996).
Managers, buyers, and purchasing agents, among others, often think in terms of a group of
items purchased from a particular vendor, rather than dealing with single items in isolation. Thus,
a potentially important discount can be achieved by having a total order, involving two or more
items, exceeding some breakpoint level. This topic will be addressed in Chapter 10, where we will
be concerned with coordinated replenishment strategies.
It should be mentioned that, in trying to achieve a quantity discount, one must take into
account the implications of a large time supply, a topic to be discussed in Section 4.7.
4.6 Accounting for Inflation
One of the assumptions in the derivation of the EOQ was that the inﬂation rate was at a negligible
level. But, in recent times, many countries have been confronted with ﬂuctuating inﬂation rates

Order Quantities When Demand Is Approximately Level

161
that often have been far from negligible.* In this section, we investigate the impact of inﬂation on
the choice of replenishment quantities.
There are several options available for modeling the eﬀects of inﬂation on costs and revenues.
We restrict our attention to the case where the ﬁxed replenishment cost A and the unit variable
cost v are aﬀected in the same fashion by inﬂation. A more elaborate model would be necessary
if inﬂation had a diﬀerent impact on the two types of costs. Moreover, the eﬀects on revenue
depend on the choice of pricing policy adopted by the organization (possibly subject to govern-
ment regulation). In Section 4.6.1, we investigate the case where (selling) price changes are made
independent of the replenishment strategy. A special case is where the unit selling price p is assumed
to increase continuously at the inﬂation rate (in the same fashion as A and v). Then, in Section
4.6.2, the result will be shown for the situation where the price is adjusted only once for each
replenishment lot. Thus, in this latter case, revenue, as well as costs, now depends on the sizes of
the replenishments.
An exact analysis in the presence of inﬂation would be extremely complicated. The reason
for this is that costs varying with time, in principle, should lead to the replenishment quantity
changing with time. At any point in time, our primary concern is with choosing the value of
only the very next replenishment. To obtain a tractable analytic result, we assume that all future
replenishments will be of the same size as the current replenishment, contrary to what the above
discussion would suggest. This assumption is not as serious as it would ﬁrst appear. In particular,
at the time of the next replenishment, we would recompute a new value for that replenishment,
reﬂecting any changes in cost (and other) parameters that have taken place in the interim. Second,
we employ discounting so that assumptions about future lot sizes should not have an appre-
ciable eﬀect on the current decision. This is an illustration of a heuristic solution procedure, a
method, based on analytic and intuitive reasoning, that is not optimal but should result in a rea-
sonable solution. Finally, we do not treat the case where quantity discounts are available. When
discounts are available, the best order quantity may be very insensitive to inﬂation because the
breakpoint value often is the best solution over a wide range of parameter values (see Gaither
1981).
4.6.1 Price Established Independent of Ordering Policy
Because the price is established independent of the ordering policy (perhaps pricing is set by market
forces external to the company under consideration), we can restrict our attention, as earlier, to the
minimization of costs. However, because costs are changing with time, we cannot compare costs
over a typical year as in Section 4.2. Instead, we resort to a common tool of investment analysis,
namely, the use of the present value (PV) of the stream of future costs.
Suppose that the continuous discount rate is denoted by r; that is, a cost of c at time t has a
PV of ce−rt (e.g., Ross et al. 2008). We denote the continuous inﬂation rate by i. Thus, if A and v
are the cost factors at time zero, then, their values at time t are Aeit and veit, respectively. With a
demand rate of D and an order of size Q, we have time between replenishments of Q/D. At each
replenishment, we incur costs of A + Qv. If the ﬁrst replenishment is received at time 0, the PV of
* In some cases, inﬂation is so high that all cash is quickly used to buy inventories because the increase in the price
of the goods exceeds the interest one can earn on invested capital. This section assumes that inﬂation is at a more
reasonable level.

the stream of costs is given by*
PV(Q) = A + Qv + (A + Qv)eiQ/De−rQ/D + (A + Qv)e2iQ/De−2rQ/D + · · ·

= (A + Qv)
1
1 −e−(r−i)Q/D
(4.14)
To ﬁnd a minimum, we set dPV(Q)/dQ = 0. As shown in Section 4A.2 of the Appendix of
this chapter, the result is
e(r−i)Q/D = 1 +
A
v + Q
 r −i


For (r −i)Q/D ≪1, which is a reasonable assumption, this equation can be simpliﬁed further
by approximating the exponential term (ex = 1 + x + x2/2 for x ≪1). Again, in the Appendix,
we obtain the following result:
Qopt =

2AD
v(r −i) = EOQ

1
1 −i/r
(4.15)
that is, the EOQ multiplied by a correction factor. Note that, when there is negligible inﬂation
(i = 0), this is nothing more than the EOQ. Hence, our justiﬁcation for using the symbol r
for the discount rate. Buzacott (1975) has developed a somewhat more exact decision rule, for
which the result of Equation 4.15 is usually a good approximation. See also Jesse et al. (1983),
Kanet and Miles (1985), and Mehra et al. (1991) who include a term for storage costs exclusive of
the opportunity cost of capital. Sarker and Pan (1994) determine the optimal order quantity and
allowable shortages in a ﬁnite replenishment inventory system under inﬂationary conditions. Also,
Rachamadugu (1988) incorporates a discounted total cost function.
In an inﬂationary environment when price is set independent of the ordering policy, the proﬁt
per unit increases with time since the last replenishment; thus, intuitively, the replenishment
quantity should be larger than under no inﬂation. Equation 4.15 indicates this type of behavior.
The cost penalty associated with using the EOQ (that ignores inﬂation) can be found from
PCP = PV(EOQ) −PV(Qopt)
PV(Qopt)
× 100
(4.16)
where PV(Q) is given by Equation 4.14. The PCP increases as i approaches r but, as shown in
this chapter’s Appendix, it reaches a limiting value of 100√Ar/2Dv, which tends to be quite small,
although it should be emphasized that this is a percentage of the total cost including purchasing
costs, not just ordering and holding costs.

4.6.1.1 Numerical Illustration
Let us reconsider the 3-ohm resistor that was used in Section 4.2. Its parameter values were
D = 2,400 units/year
v = $0.40/unit
A = $3.20
r = 0.24 $/$/year
The EOQ under no inﬂation was found to be 400 units. The use of Equation 4.15 produces
the behavior shown in Table 4.2 for diﬀerent values of i. The percentage cost penalties computed
from Equation 4.16 are also presented in Table 4.2 and are seen to be extremely small.
4.6.2 Price Set as a Fixed Fractional Markup on Unit Variable Cost
Let us denote the unit selling price established by the company at time t as p(t). Suppose that a
replenishment order is paid for at time t at unit variable cost v(t); the next order will be paid for
at time t + T. Then a ﬁxed fractional markup (f ) implies
p(t + τ) = v(t)(1 + f )
0 ≤τ < T
(4.17)
where p(t + τ) is the price at time t + τ. That is, the same unit price is used throughout the entire
time period covered by each replenishment.
v(t) depends on the inﬂation rate as in the previous section; thus, the unit selling price also
depends on the inﬂation rate and on the order quantity Q, the latter in that T = Q/D in Equa-
tion 4.17. Consequently, both costs and revenues are inﬂuenced here by the choice of the order
quantity Q. An appropriate criterion is to select Q in order to maximize the PV of revenues minus
costs. Buzacott (1975) uses an analysis similar to that presented* to obtain
Qopt =

v(r + ﬁ) = EOQ


1 + ﬁ/r
(4.18)
When the markup for the sale of a whole replenishment lot is set as a ﬁxed fraction of the unit
variable cost at the start of a cycle and costs are increasing because of inﬂation, intuitively the order
quantity should be reduced from the EOQ position in order to be able to keep the selling price
more closely in line with a markup f on the current unit variable cost. Equation 4.18 reﬂects this
* An added complexity is that the revenue is a continuous function of time that must be discounted.

intuitive behavior. It is seen that, as the product ﬁincreases, Qopt becomes smaller relative to the
EOQ.
4.7 Limits on Order Sizes
The basic EOQ that we derived earlier considers only the costs of replenishing and carrying
the inventory. All the variables used reﬂect only ﬁnancial considerations. There are a number of
possible physical constraints, not explicitly included in the model, that might prevent the use
of the so-called best solution derived from the model. We look at some of these constraints in
Sections 4.7.1 through 4.7.3.*
4.7.1 Maximum Time Supply or Capacity Restriction
1. The shelf life (SL) of the commodity may be an important factor. Some items have an SL
dictated by perishability, which we investigate more fully in Chapter 9. The SL of other items
may be more unusual. For instance, certain computers, generators, and so on have a limited
warranty that starts from the date of delivery, and not the date of ﬁrst use. Previously we
derived the EOQ expressed as a time supply as

* Das (1990) provides an algorithm for computing optimal order sizes for several of these cases. See also Moon and
Yun (1993) who applies discounted cash ﬂow analysis to the ﬁnite horizon case.

Order Quantities When Demand Is Approximately Level
■
165
As illustrated graphically in Figure 4.6, if this quantity exceeds the allowable shelf life SL,
then, the best feasible order quantity to use (i.e., it produces the lowest feasible point on the
cost curve) is the SL quantity itself,
QSL = D(SL)
2. Even without an SL limitation, an EOQ that represents a very long time supply may be unre-
alistic for other reasons. A long time supply takes us well out into the future where demand
becomes uncertain and obsolescence can become a signiﬁcant concern. This is an important
constraint on class C items, as we will see in Chapter 8. A good example of obsolescence
would be an impending engineering change.
3. There may be a storage capacity limitation on the replenishment size for an item (e.g., the
entire replenishment must ﬁt in a dedicated storage bin). Equivalently, in production situa-
tions (to be discussed in Chapters 10 through 16), there may be a ﬁnite production capacity
available for the item or a group of related items. A capacity limitation is mathematically
equivalent to an SL restriction.
4.7.2 Minimum Order Quantity
The supplier may specify a minimum allowable order quantity. A similar situation exists in an
in-house production operation where there is a lower limit on an order quantity that can be
realistically considered. If the EOQ is less than this quantity, then, the best allowable order quantity
is the supplier or production minimum.
4.7.3 Discrete Units
The EOQ, as given by Equation 4.4, will likely result in a nonintegral number of units. However,
it can be shown mathematically (and is obvious from the form of the total cost curve of Figure 4.2)
that the best integer value of Q has to be one of the two integers surrounding the best (noninte-
ger) solution given by Equation 4.4. For simplicity, we recommend simply rounding the result of
Equation 4.4, that is, the EOQ, to the nearest integer.*
Certain commodities are sold in pack sizes containing more than one unit; for example, many
ﬁrms sell in pallet-sized loads only, say 48 units (e.g., cases). Therefore, it makes sense to restrict a
replenishment quantity to integer multiples of 48 units. In fact, if a new unit, corresponding to 48
of the old unit, is deﬁned, then, we are back to the basic situation of requiring an integer number
of (the new) units in a replenishment quantity.
There is another possible restriction on the replenishment quantity that is very similar to that
of discrete units. This is the situation where the replenishment must cover an integral number of
periods of demand. Again, we simply ﬁnd the optimal continuous Q expressed as a time supply
(see Equation 4.7) and round to the nearest integer value of the time supply.
* Strictly speaking, one should evaluate the total costs, using Equation 4.3, for each of the two surrounding integers
and pick the integer having the lower costs. However, rounding produces a trivial percentage cost penalties except
possibly when the EOQ is in the range of only one or two units. In addition, the data that are used in Equation 4.3
often have a signiﬁcantly larger error than the error introduced by rounding to the suboptimal integer.

4.8 Finite Replenishment Rate: The Economic Production
Quantity
One of the assumptions inherent in the derivation of the EOQ was that the whole replenishment
quantity arrives at the same time. If, instead, we assume that it becomes available at a rate of m per
unit time (the production rate of the machinery used to produce the item), then, the sawtoothed
diagram of Figure 4.1 is modiﬁed to that of Figure 4.7. All that changes from the earlier derivation
is the average inventory level that is now Q(1 −D/m)/2. The total relevant costs are given by
TRC(Q) = AD
Q + Q(1 −D/m)vr
2
and the best Q value is now the ﬁnite replenishment economic order quantity (FREOQ), also
known as the economic production quantity (EPQ) or the economic run quantity.
FREOQ =

(4.19)
As shown in Equation 4.19, the EOQ is multiplied by a correction factor. The magnitude of
this correction factor for various values of D/m is shown in Figure 4.8. Also shown are the cost
penalties caused by ignoring the correction and simply using the basic EOQ. It is clear that D/m

has to be fairly large before the cost penalty becomes signiﬁcant; for example, even when D/m is
0.5 (i.e., the demand rate is one-half of the production rate), the cost penalty for neglecting the
ﬁnite nature of the production rate is only 6.1%.
Note that as D/m gets very small (equivalent to instantaneous production of the entire lot),
the FREOQ reduces to the EOQ as it should. Moreover, as D/m tends to unity, Equation 4.19
suggests that we produce an indeﬁnitely large lot. This makes sense in that demand exactly matches
the production rate. For D/m > 1, the model breaks down because the capacity of the machine
is insuﬃcient to keep up with the demand. However, the model is still useful under these cir-
cumstances. To illustrate, suppose that D = 1.6 m. Here, one would dedicate one machine to the
product (with no changeover costs) and produce the remaining 0.6 m in ﬁnite lot sizes on a second
machine, where the latter machine’s capacity would likely be shared with other items. An example,
encountered by one of the authors in a consulting assignment, involved the same fastener man-
ufacturer mentioned earlier in the chapter. One part had enough demand to more than fully use
the capacity of one machine. At the time, however, this part was manufactured on several diﬀerent
machines that also made other parts. Managers were working to rearrange the production schedule
to dedicate a machine entirely to the part, while producing any excess demand for that part on
other shared machines. Further discussion on the sharing of production equipment among several
items will be presented in Chapter 10.*

Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
4.9 Incorporation of Other Factors
In this section, we brieﬂy discuss four further modiﬁcations of the basic EOQ that result from
the relaxation of one or more of the assumptions required in the earlier derivation. The treatment
of another important situation—namely, where the quantity supplied does not necessarily exactly
match the quantity ordered—can be found in Silver (1976). Other references on this topic can be
found in Chapter 7. For the case in which the amount of stock displayed on the shelf inﬂuences
the demand, see Paul et al. (1996).
4.9.1 Nonzero Constant Lead Time That Is Known with Certainty
As long as demand remains deterministic, the introduction of a known, constant, nonzero replen-
ishment lead time (L) presents no diﬃculty. The inventory diagram of Figure 4.1 is unchanged.
When the inventory level hits DL, an order is placed. It arrives exactly L time units later, just as
the inventory hits zero.* If the lead time is longer than the time between replenishments, the order
should be placed when the on-hand plus on-order level drops to DL.
The costs are unaltered so that the best order quantity is still given by Equation 4.4. For exam-
ple, suppose the lead time for the 3-ohm resistor (from Section 4.2) is 3 weeks. The EOQ is 400,
and the weekly demand is 48 (based on a 50-week year). When the inventory on hand falls to
48 × 3 = 144 units, the order should be placed. Figure 4.9 illustrates this concept. (A nonzero

lead time considerably complicates matters when demand is probabilistic; and when lead times
themselves can be probabilistic, the analysis also gets even more involved. These cases are discussed
in Chapter 6.)
4.9.2 Nonzero Payment Period
We have implicitly assumed, by simply looking at average costs per unit time, that payment is
immediate upon the receipt of goods. In practice, one can have a period of t years (t, of course,
is a fraction) by the end of which the payment must be received. As in Section 4.6, we now
must worry about the timing of expenses, so we again use a PV analysis. We assume that the
ﬁxed cost, A, is incurred immediately. The PV of repeatedly using an order quantity of size Q is
then
PV(Q) = A + Qve−rt + PV(Q)e−rQ/D
In a manner closely paralleling Section 4.6, we ﬁnd
Qopt =

2AD
ve−rtr = EOQ
√
ert
This result has a simple intuitive interpretation. The unit variable cost v is reduced to ve−rt, because
we retain the associated dollars for a time t. Recognizing that rt is likely to be substantially less than
unity, we have
Qopt ≈EOQ
	
1 + rt
2

so that the eﬀect of the nonzero payment period is quite small and approximately linear in t. Other
treatments of repetitive payment periods are provided by Thompson (1975), Kingsman (1983),
and Arcelus and Srinivasan (1993). For the case where the supplier oﬀers a one-time larger payment
period (u > t), Silver (1999) shows that a simple result holds, namely that the appropriate time
supply to use should be u −t years larger than the ongoing best time supply (i.e., Qopt/D). Davis
and Gaither (1985) also consider a one-time opportunity to extend the payment.
4.9.3 Different Types of Carrying Charge
In Section 4.2, we assumed that the carrying charge was directly proportional to the average inven-
tory level measured in dollars. We calculated the inventory turnover ratio using similar logic.
Modiﬁcations to this inventory accounting are possible. Each can be handled with the resulting
order quantity expression being somewhat more complex than Equation 4.4.
To illustrate, consider the situation where costs depend on area or volume considerations as well
as the value of the inventory. (It is intuitive that it should cost more per unit time to store a dollar
of feathers than a dollar of coal.) Suppose that there is a charge of w dollars per unit time per cubic
foot of space allocated to an item. Assume that this space must be suﬃcient to handle the maximum
inventory level of the item. One situation where such a change would be appropriate is where items
are maintained in separate bins, and a speciﬁc bin size (which must house the maximum inventory)

170

is allocated to each item. The best replenishment quantity under these circumstances is

2AD
2hw + vr
where h is the volume (in cubic feet) occupied per unit of the item.
4.9.4 Multiple Setup Costs: Freight Discounts
Consider the situation of an item in which the costs of a replenishment depend on the quantity in
the following fashion:
Q Range
Cost
0 < Q ≤Q0
A + Qv
Q0 < Q ≤2Q0
2A + Qv
2Q0 < Q ≤3Q0
3A + Qv
One interpretation is that the item is produced in some type of container (e.g., a vat or barrel)
of ﬁxed capacity Q0 and there is a ﬁxed cost A associated with the use of each container. Such a ﬁxed
cost may arise from a need to clean or repair the vat between uses. Another interpretation relates
to transportation costs where Q0 might be the capacity of a shipping container or rail car. Under
the above cost structure, Aucamp (1982) has shown that the best solution is either the standard
EOQ or one of the two surrounding integer multiples of Q0. Early research incorporating freight
cost into EOQ decisions by Baumol and Vinod (1970) highlights the importance of potentially
including freight cost in inventory decisions. This paper investigates the trade-oﬀbetween speed
of delivery and cost in an EOQ-type context. Lee (1986) generalizes Aucamp’s work by allowing
for a cost of Aj for the jth load. Therefore, there is a possible advantage to increasing the number
of loads. Knowles and Pantumsinchai (1988) address a situation in which the vendor oﬀers prod-
ucts only in various container sizes. Larger discounts are oﬀered on larger containers. Tersine and
Barman (1994) examine incremental and all-units discounts for both purchase price and freight
cost. Russell and Krajewski (1991) address the situation in which ﬁrms overdeclare the amount of
freight shipped in order to reduce the total freight cost. They include a ﬁxed and incremental cost
for both purchase and freight. See also Carter and Ferrin (1995). See Gupta (1994) for a treatment
of the case in which the ordering cost increases as the replenishment quantity increases. Finally,
Van Eijs (1994) examines the problem in a multi-item context with random demands, a problem
we will address in Chapter 10. See also Carter et al. (1995a) and Shinn et al. (1996). Thomas
and Tyworth (2006), Mendoza and Ventura (2008), and Toptal and Bingöl (2011) investigate
the impact of freight costs, speciﬁcally with truckload and less-than-truckload (LTL) costs, on the
choice of replenishment lot size.
A common theme in much of this work is that the explicit inclusion of freight costs in the
EOQ model can dramatically impact the choice of order quantity due to economies of scale
in transportation. As an illustration, let us revisit the example from Section 4.2 of the 3-ohm
resistor (stable demand D = 2,400 units/year, unit variable cost v = $0.40/unit, ﬁxed cost per
replenishment A = $3.20, and holding cost rate r = 0.24 $/$/year), but now include freight

charges. Furthermore, suppose the transportation provider charges a lower rate per unit for larger
orders as follows:
Q Range
Freight Cost per Unit
0 ≥Q < 250
$0.030
250 ≥Q < 500
$0.025
500 ≥Q < 1,000
$0.020
1,000 ≥Q
$0.015
Now that freight costs vary with Q, those costs should be included in the total relevant costs
per unit time. In a manner quite similar to quantity discounts, these freight cost break points
cause discontinuities that must be evaluated as shown in Figure 4.10. When these freight costs are
included in this example, the cost minimizing lot size is Q = 500; it is worth ordering more than
the EOQ of 400 in order to obtain the freight savings.
One nuance worth mentioning is that in some freight settings—LTL carriage for example—
carriers* may charge the shipper for more units than are actually shipped if it results in a lower cost.

In this case, if the quantity shipped is 225 units, the list price in that range is $0.03/unit for a cost
per shipment of $6.75 and an annual shipping cost of $72.00; however, with a quantity of 225, it
is better for the shipper to be charged as if 250 units were being shipped, giving a cost per ship-
ment of (250)($0.025) = $6.25 and an annual shipping cost of ($6.25)(2,400/225) = $66.67. Our
experience suggests that when this situation arises, it is frequently worth increasing the shipping
quantity to equal the billed quantity, as is the case in this example.
4.9.5 A Special Opportunity to Procure
An important situation, often faced by both producers and merchants, is a one-time opportunity to
procure an item at a reduced unit cost. For example, this may be the last opportunity to replenish
before a price rise.
Because of the change in one of the parameters (the unit cost), the current order quantity
can diﬀer from future order quantities. (All these future quantities will be identical—namely,
the EOQ with the new unit cost.) Thus, the simple sawtooth pattern of Figure 4.1 no longer
necessarily applies. Hence, we cannot base our analysis on the average inventory level and the
number of replenishments in a typical year (or other units of time). Instead, in comparing the
two possible choices for the current value of the order quantity Q, strictly speaking, we should
compare costs out to a point in time where the two alternatives leave us in an identical inven-
tory state. To illustrate, suppose that the demand rate is 100 units/month and the new EOQ
will be 200 units. Furthermore, suppose that two alternatives under consideration for the cur-
rent order quantity are 200 and 400 units. As shown in Figure 4.11, an appropriate horizon for
cost comparison would be 4 months because, for both alternatives, the inventory level would be
zero at that point in time. A comparison of costs out to 1.95 months, for example, would be

biased in favor of the 200-unit alternative because the imminent (0.05 months later) setup cost
under this alternative would not be included. An exact (PV) comparison for all alternatives is
rather complex mathematically, particularly when there is a continuum of choices for the order
quantity.
Instead, we recommend an approximate approach, suggested by Naddor (1966). Let the deci-
sion variable, the current order quantity, be denoted by Q. Let the current unit cost be v1 and the
future unit cost be v2 (v2 > v1). The EOQ, after the price rise, is given by Equation 4.4 as
EOQ2 =

2AD
v2r
(4.20)
Furthermore, from Equation 4.3, the costs per unit time are then
TRC(EOQ2) =

2ADv2r + Dv2
(4.21)
If the current order quantity is of size Q, then, it will last for Q/D units of time. The average
inventory during this period is Q/2. Hence, the total costs out to time Q/D are
TC(Q) = A + Qv1 + Q
2 v1
Q
D r
= A + Qv1 + Q2v1r
2D
(4.22)
Consider the extreme case where Q was set equal to 0 so that the price increase would occur
and we would immediately start ordering the new EOQ2. Under this strategy, the total costs out
to some time T would be, from Equation 4.21,
T

2ADv2r + DTv2
It is reasonable to select the value of Q to maximize
F(Q) = (Q/D)

2ADv2r + Qv2 −TC(Q)
(4.23)
the improvement in the total cost out to time Q/D achieved by ordering Q at the old price instead
of not ordering anything at the old price. It can be shown that the use of this criterion need not lead
to the exact cost-minimizing solution. Again, we are opting for a heuristic procedure for selecting
the value of the decision variable (in this case Q). A convenient approach to maximizing F(Q) is
to set dF(Q)/dQ = 0. From Equations 4.22 and 4.23

The above analysis implicitly assumed that the initial inventory (at the moment that the special
opportunity replenishment was to be made) was 0. If instead the inventory was I0, then, Lev and
Soyster (1979) show that Qopt becomes the result of Equation 4.25 minus I0; that is, Equation
4.25 gives the appropriate order-up-to-level. Taylor and Bradley (1985) generalize to the case of
future announced price increases; that is, the ﬁrm has time to adjust several order cycles in advance.
See also Tersine (1996).
Other analyses of this problem are presented by Brown (1982) and McClain and Thomas
(1980). The latter authors, in particular, use a marginal approach that very quickly gives a decision
rule. However, the rule, unlike Equation 4.25, is not easily extendible to the case of multiple items,
a case to be discussed in a moment. Miltenburg (1987) has shown that the Brown and Naddor
decision rules give very similar results on a broad range of problems. Yanasse (1990) arrives at
Equation 4.25 through a slightly diﬀerent approach.*
Lev et al. (1981) extend the analysis to include the possibility of multiple cost or demand
parameter changes in two distinct time periods. Ardalan (1994) ﬁnds the optimal price and order
quantity for a retailer who is oﬀered a temporary price reduction. The retailer’s demand increases
as its price decreases. Finally, Brill and Chaouch (1995) discuss the EOQ model when a random
shock can aﬀect the demand rate. See Goyal et al. (1991) for a review of the literature in this
area. See also Aucamp and Kuzdrall (1989), Aull-Hyde (1992, 1996), Tersine and Barman (1995),
Arcelus and Srinivasan (1995), Kim (1995), and Moinzadeh (1997).
4.9.5.1 Numerical Illustration
Consider a particular Toronto-based x-ray ﬁlm dealer supplied by a ﬁlm manufacturer. Suppose
that the manufacturer announces a price increase for a product XMF-082 from $28.00/box to
$30.00/box. The dealer uses approximately 80 boxes per year and estimates the ﬁxed cost per order
to be $1.50 and the carrying charge as 0.20 $/$/year. From Equation 4.20
EOQ2 =

2 × 1.50 × 80
30.00 × 0.2
≈6 boxes
Then, Equation 4.25 gives
Qopt = 30.00
28.00(6) + 2.00
28.00
80
0.2
= 35.3, say 35 boxes
The increase in unit price from $28.00/box to $30.00/box (a 7% increase) causes a one-time
procurement quantity of 35 boxes instead of 6 boxes (an increase of almost 500%!), a much higher
sensitivity than in the basic EOQ itself (see Section 4.3).
* One inventory software package artiﬁcially “ages” the inventory by multiplying all reorder points by a factor (say
1.3) when a price increase is announced. Then, orders are placed for all products that have fallen below these new
temporary reorder points. If the cost of the orders is too high, the factor is reduced. We will have more to say on
reorder points in Chapters 6 and 7.

■
175
Substitution of each of Q = 6 and Q = 35 into Equation 4.24 gives
F(6) = $12.09
and
F(35) = $42.23
so that the one-time cost savings of using the order quantity of 35 boxes is (42.23–12.09) or
$30.14.
Two additional points are worth making:
1. The one-time purchase is likely to represent a large time supply. Obsolescence and other
forms of uncertainty may dictate an upper limit on this time supply. Many high-technology
ﬁrms face rapid obsolescence—the price of their products falls quickly with time. They are
therefore very reluctant to carry much stock.
2. The multi-item case, in which a vendor oﬀers a one-time price break on a range of products,
is obviously of interest. In such a situation, there is likely to be a constraint on the total
amount that can be spent on the one-time purchase or on the total inventory (because of
warehouse capacity). For illustrative purposes, let us consider the case of a constraint on the
total amount that can be spent. For notation let
Di = usage rate of item i, in units/year
Ai = ﬁxed setup cost of item i, in dollars
v1i = unit cost of item i in the special opportunity to buy, in $/unit
v2i = unit cost of item i in the future, in $/unit
Qi = amount, in units, of item i to be purchased in the special buy
EOQ2i = economic order quantity of item i in units, under the future unit cost
n = number of items in the group under consideration (we assume in the sequel
that the items are numbered 1, 2, 3, . . . , n)
W = maximum total amount, in dollars, that can be spent on the special buy
Then, the procedure for selecting the Q′
is is as follows:
Step 1 Determine the unconstrained best Q′

Q∗

EOQ2i + v2i −v1i

If Q∗

i = 0 and solve for all other items.
Note in Equation 4.28 that as the total budget decreases, the term (DiW /n
j=1 Djv1j)
decreases linearly. Thus, the item with the highest demand rate, Di, will have its Q∗
i decrease
fastest. This point is also evident from the fact that (d(Q∗

j=1 Djv1j).
For more discussion on this topic, see Chapter 10, which deals with coordinating the purchase or
production of multiple items.
4.10 Selection of the Carrying Charge (r), the Fixed Cost per
Replenishment (A), or the Ratio A/r Based on Aggregate
Considerations: The Exchange Curve
Often, it is diﬃcult to explicitly determine an appropriate value of the carrying charge r or the
ﬁxed cost per replenishment A. An alternate method, which we discussed in Chapter 2, takes into
account of the aggregate viewpoint of management. In this and the later sections, we derive the rela-
tionships and graphs that we earlier asked you to accept on faith. For a population of inventoried
items, the management may impose an aggregate constraint of one of the following forms:
1. The average total inventory cannot exceed a certain dollar value or volume.*
2. The total ﬁxed cost (or total number) of replenishments per unit time (e.g., 1 year) must be
less than a certain value.†
3. The maximum allowed backorder delay may not exceed a certain value.
4. The ﬁrm should operate at a point where the trade-oﬀ(exchange) between the average
inventory and the cost (or number) of replenishments per unit time is at some reasonable
prescribed value.
We restrict our attention to the case where the ﬁxed cost per replenishment for item i, denoted
by Ai, cannot be determined explicitly, but it is reasonable to assume that a common value of
A holds (at least approximately) for all items in the portion of the inventory population under
consideration. We designate the demand rate, unit variable cost, and order quantity of item i by
* Sometimes, a ﬁrm allows its diﬀerent entities to determine their optimal budgets, and then, it cuts them all by
a common factor. Because this “cut across the board” rule is in general not optimal, Rosenblatt and Rothblum
(1994) identify the conditions for it to provide globally optimal solutions. See also Pirkul and Aras (1985).

Di, vi, and Q i, respectively. We also let n be the number of items in the population. (The case
where the Ai’s are explicitly predetermined can be treated in a similar fashion.)
As shown in Section A4.4 of the Appendix of this chapter, if we use an EOQ for each item, we
obtain the total average cycle stock in dollars,

which is a hyperbola. Moreover, the division of Equation 4.29 by Equation 4.30 gives

so that any point on the hyperbolic curve implies a value of A/r. Of course, if either A or r is known
explicitly, the implicit value of A/r implies a value of the one remaining unknown parameter.
To summarize, when an EOQ strategy* is used for each item, the management can select a
desired point on the tradeoﬀcurve (with associated aggregate conditions), thus implying an appro-
priate value of r, A, or A/r. The latter parameters can now be thought of as management control
variables. In fact, in the late 1980s, a major U.S. automotive ﬁrm used a value of 40% for r. When
questioned why the value was so high, the reply was, “We want to decrease inventory.” In other
words, the management artiﬁcially increased r so that computerized inventory control routines
would force down inventory levels. It should be noted that the use of r as a policy variable is closely
related to a technique known as LIMIT (lot-size inventory management interpolation technique)
discussed by Eaton (1964). See also Chakravarty (1986).
4.10.1 Exchange Curve Illustration
A small ﬁrm stocks just 20 items, all of which are purchased from several suppliers in Germany.
Therefore, it is realistic to think in terms of a ﬁxed setup cost A, which does not vary appreciably
* When an aggregate constraint is to be satisﬁed, it is not obvious that the best strategy for an individual item is
to use an EOQ-type order quantity. In fact, the more mathematically oriented reader may wish to verify that, for
example, minimization of the total number of replenishments per unit time subject to a speciﬁed total average
stock (or minimization of total average stock subject to a speciﬁed total number of replenishments per unit time)
does indeed lead to an EOQ-type formula. If a Lagrange multiplier approach is used, the multiplier turns out to
be identical with r/A (or A/r). An introduction to the use of Lagrange multipliers in constrained optimization is
provided in Appendix I.

Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
from item to item. Based on a detailed study of costs and policy factors, the management decided
to set the value of A at $2.10. A spreadsheet was used to generate the exchange curve of Fig-
ure 4.12. The current operating procedure (estimated by using the most recent replenishment
quantity actually used for each of the items in the division) is also shown in Figure 4.12.
It is clear that improvements are possible through the use of EOQs with a suitable value of A/r.
(This is because the current logic does not explicitly take the economic factors into account—some
inexpensive items are ordered too frequently while some fast movers are not ordered often enough.)
At one extreme, by operating at point P (with an implied A/r of 11.07), the same total average
cycle stock is achieved as by the current rule but the total number of replenishments per year is
reduced from 1700 to 759 (a 55.4% reduction). Point Q (with an implied A/r of 2.21) represents
the opposite extreme where the same total number of replenishments is achieved as by the current
rule, but the total average cycle stock is cut from $8,400 to $3,749 (a 55.4% reduction). Decreases,
compared with the current rule, are possible in both aggregate measures at any point between P and
Q. Suppose the management has agreed that a total average cycle stock of $7,000 is a reasonable
aggregate operating condition. The associated A/r value (using Equation 4.29) is 7.69. Since A has
been explicitly determined, we have that
r = A ÷ A/r = 2.10 ÷ 7.69 = 0.273$/$/year

Rather than using a three-decimal value for r, we choose to round to 0.27 $/$/year for
convenience in subsequent calculations.
To summarize, exchange curves permit us to show improvements (in terms of aggregate per-
formance measures) over the current operating practices. From a top management perspective, this
is far more appealing than the fact that the EOQ minimizes the total costs on an individual item
basis (particularly when the individual cost factors are so diﬃcult to estimate). In Section 4A.6 of
the Appendix to this chapter, we describe a powerful estimation procedure for exchange curves that
is based on the lognormal distribution. (See the Appendix to Chapter 2 as well.)
4.11 Summary
In this chapter, we have speciﬁed a procedure for selecting the appropriate size of a replenishment
quantity under demand conditions that are essentially static in nature; that is, we assume that the
demand rate is at a constant level that does not change with time. Under a rigorous set of additional
assumptions, the resulting order quantity is the well-known square root, EOQ.
We argued that the exact values of one or both of the parameters r and A may be very diﬃcult
to obtain. In such a case, we showed that a value of r, A, or A/r can be implicitly speciﬁed by
selecting a desired operating point on an aggregate exchange curve of the total average stock versus
the total number or costs of replenishments per year.
Sizable deviations of the order quantity away from the optimum value produce rather small
cost errors. This robust feature of the EOQ helps justify its widespread use in practice. Often,
the limited savings achievable do not justify the eﬀort required to develop overly sophisticated
variations of the EOQ. Nevertheless, as conditions change with time, it becomes necessary to
recompute the appropriate value of the order quantity.
Several simple modiﬁcations of the basic EOQ have been discussed; these modiﬁcations make
the results more widely applicable. In the next chapter, we develop a practical procedure for coping
with situations where the average or forecast demand rate varies appreciably with time. Three other
important extensions will be left to the later chapters, namely,
1. Situations where demand is no longer deterministic (Chapter 6).
2. Situations where savings in replenishment costs are possible through the coordination of two
or more items at the same stocking point (Chapter 10).
3. Situations (referred to as multiechelon) where the replenishment quantities of serially related
production or storage facilities should not be treated independently (Chapter 11).
In each of these circumstances, we will ﬁnd that the basic EOQ plays an important role.

in r make sense?
4.2
Demand for a product at a depot is at a constant rate of 250 units per week. The product is
supplied to the depot from the factory. The factory cost is $10 per unit, while the total cost
of a shipment from the factory to the depot when the shipment has size M is given by
Shipment cost = $50 + $2M
The inventory carrying cost in $/$/week is 0.004. Determine the appropriate shipment
size.
4.3
A ﬁrm can produce and package their own guitar strings, or buy prepacked rolls of “dis-
count” guitar strings. If they load their own strings, there is a production setup cost of
$20. The ﬁnished product is valued at $1.23 a set, and the production rate is 500 sets/day.
“Discount” strings cost the ﬁrm $1.26 per set and the ﬁxed ordering charge is $3/order. In
either case, an inventory carrying charge of 0.24 $/$/year would be used by the company.
Demand for this item is 10,000 sets per year. From the standpoint of replenishment and
carrying costs, what should the company do? What other considerations might aﬀect the
decision?
4.4
A manufacturing ﬁrm located in Calgary produces an item in a 3-month time supply. An
analyst, attempting to introduce a more logical approach to selecting run quantities, has
obtained the following estimates of the characteristics of the item:
D = 4,000 units/year
A = $5
v = $4 per 100 units
r = 0.25 $/$/year
Note: Assume that the production rate is much larger than D.
a. What is the EOQ of the item?
b. What is the time between consecutive replenishments of the item when the EOQ is
used?
c. The production manager insists that the A = $5 ﬁgure is only a guess. Therefore, he
insists on using his simple 3-month supply rule. Indicate how you would ﬁnd the range
of A values for which the EOQ (based on A = $5) would be preferable (in terms of a
lower total of replenishment and carrying costs) to the 3-month supply.
4.5
Suppose that all the assumptions of the EOQ derivation hold except that we now allow
backorders (i.e., we deliberately let the stock level run negative before we order; backordered
requests are completely ﬁlled out of the next replenishment). Now, there are two decision
variables: Q and s (the level below zero at which we place an order).
a. Using a sketch and geometrical considerations, ﬁnd the average on-hand inventory level
and the average level of backorders.
b. Suppose that there is a cost B2v per unit backordered (independent of how long the
unit is backordered) where B2 is a dimensionless factor. Find the best settings of Q and
s as a function of A, D, v, r, and B2.
c. Repeat the previous part but now with a cost B3v per unit backordered per unit time.
The dimensions of B3 are equivalent to those for r.

A particular product is produced on a fabrication line. Using the ﬁnite replenishment EOQ
model, the suggested run quantity is 1,000 units. On a particular day of production, this
item is being run near the end of a shift and the supervisor, instead of stopping at 1,000
units and having to set up for a new item (which would make her performance look bad in
terms of the total output), continues to produce the item to the end of the shift, resulting
in a total production quantity of 2,000 units. Discuss how you would analyze whether or
not she made a decision that was attractive from a company standpoint. Include comments
on the possible intangible factors.

The inventory manager vehemently argues that there is no way that he can evaluate A
and r; however, he is prepared to admit that A/r is reasonably constant across the items.
He has been following an ordering policy of using a 4-month time supply of each item. He
has been under pressure from the controller to reduce the average inventory level by 25%.
Therefore, he is about to adopt a 3-month time supply.
a. Develop an EOQ aggregate exchange curve.
b. What are the values of TACS and N for A/r = 200?
c. What A/r value gives the same TACS as the current rule?
d. What A/r value gives the same N as the proposed rule?
e. Use the curve to suggest an option or options open to the manager that is (are) preferable
to his proposed action.

In a small distribution ﬁrm, the controller was advocating a min-max system with speciﬁc
rules for computing the minimum and maximum levels of each item. Suppose that for each
item the values of A, v, D, L, and r could be reasonably accurately ascertained.

a. Indicate how you would estimate the approximate cost savings of selecting the order
quantity of an item through EOQ considerations rather than by the controller’s method.
(Hint: Assume that the order quantity is approximately equal to the diﬀerence between
the maximum and minimum levels.)
b. Illustrate for the following item: A = $3.20; v = $10; D = 900 units/year; L = 10
weeks; and r = 0.24 $/$/year.

The Dartmouth Bookstore sells 300 notebooks per term. Each notebook carries a variable
cost of $0.50, while the ﬁxed cost to restock the shelves amounts to $4.00. The carrying
charge of one notebook tied in the inventory is $0.08 per $/term.
a. Calculate the EOQ.
b. Calculate the total relevant cost associated with the EOQ calculated in the previous
part.
c. If the Dartmouth Bookstore instead chooses to order 300 notebooks instead of the
EOQ, calculate the PCP of this order size.
d. Calculate the best order quantity now considering a 40% discount on orders greater
than 300.
e. Calculate the optimal order quantity if the bookstore decides to incorporate an inﬂation
rate of 2% in the decision.
f. Assume that a particular notebook occupies 0.10 cubic foot of space, for which the
bookstore ﬁgures that it costs them $2 per term per cubic foot. Calculate the best
replenishment quantity under these circumstances.
g. Now assume that the unit cost of the same notebook increases from $0.50 to $0.60.
Calculate the new EOQ.
4.15
Consider an item whose demand rate is 100 units per year and that costs $40 per unit. If
the ﬁxed cost of ordering is $50 and the carrying charge is 25%, answer the following:
a. Find the EOQ.
b. The purchasing manager is trying to understand the reasons for the high cost of order-
ing. In this process, she wonders how low A must become for the EOQ to equal 1 unit.
What value of A will she ﬁnd?
4.16
An item is produced on a particular machine. The setup time to change over production
from some other item to this one is quite large. The machine is run for a single 10-hour shift
each day. Changeovers can be done, if desired, in the oﬀ-shift time. When a production run
of the item is initiated, an obvious decision is how much to produce. How is this decision
similar to the one of ordering an item from the supplier where the supplier only sells the
item in a rather large pack-size (or container)?

Monopack is a manufacturer of a single product. The company has been concerned about
the rising inﬂation rate in the economy for sometime. Currently, Monopack does not incor-
porate the eﬀects of inﬂation into its calculation of its EOQ. The company is interested in
ﬁnding out if inﬂation will impact its choice of replenishment sizes. Characteristics of the
product were found to be
D = 3,000 units per year
A = $5.45
v = $0.60/unit
r = 20%
Note: Assume that the product price is established independent of the ordering policy
and that inﬂation aﬀects A and v in the same manner.

A ﬁrm buys a product from a supplier using the EOQ to determine the order quantity. The
supplier recently called and asked the buyer to purchase in larger lots so that the supplier’s
production process can be made more eﬃcient. Speciﬁcally, assume that the buyer will buy
k times EOQ units, where k > 1. The per unit cost must be reduced to make this attractive
to the buyer. What is the fractional discount at which the buyer will be indiﬀerent between
the old EOQ at the old price and buying k EOQ at the new price?
4.19
A retailer sells about 5,000 units per year of a particular item. The following data has been
found for this item:
A = $100
v = $2 per unit
r = 0.28 $/$/year
The retailer is now using an order quantity of 500 units. A keen analyst observes that
savings could be realized by instead using the EOQ. The retail manager says to forget about
mathematics—he has a way of reducing the setup cost to only $25. He argues for doing this
and retaining the current order quantity. Who is right? Discuss.

The Andy Dandy Candy Company has asked you to recommend an EOQ for their Jelly
Bean product. They have provided you with the following information:
a. The only costs involved are the cost of ordering and the cost of holding the inventory
that is equal to the average amount of capital times $0.30. Back orders are not allowed,
and there are no other costs.
b. The company always has a sale when a shipment of Jelly Beans arrives, until half of the
shipment is gone, at which time the company raises its price.
This implies that there are two known, continuous, constant rates of demand D2 and
D1, D1 being the rate during the sale, with D1 > D2. As a consultant, you are requested to
recommend an EOQ formula for this situation. In your report, you must speciﬁcally cover
the following points:
a. A graphical representation of the inventory process. (What is the fraction of time spent
at the rate D1?)
b. A total cost equation, deﬁning the terms.
c. A brief explanation of the method of obtaining the optimal order quantity.
d. A numerical example using A = $20; vr = $2; D1 = 30; and D2 = 15.
e. How much should be ordered in the above numerical example if D1 = D2 = 30?

A supplier oﬀers a manufacturer an item at a 5% discount on orders of 500 units or
more, and a 15% discount on orders of 1,000 units or more. From past experience, it
appears that demand for this item is 3,075 units/year. If the ordering cost is $50, the basic
price (without discount) of the item is $2, and an r value of 0.20 $/$/year is used, how
often should the manufacturer order from the supplier? What order quantity should be
used?

Consider a quantity discount problem in which the form of the discount diﬀers from
the all-units case that we have discussed in this chapter. Speciﬁcally, the supplier oﬀers

the particular discount interval, and not to all units ordered.
a. Using the notation introduced in Section 4.5, write a total cost expression as a function

The May-Bee Company distributes ﬁre-ﬁghting equipment. Approximately 50% of the
company’s SKUs are imported and the rest are acquired from domestic suppliers. May-Bee
sales have been increasing at a steady rate and future trends appear to be very optimistic.
The company is wholly owned by a Mr Brown who relies heavily on his bank for working
capital. His current credit limit is set at $150,000 and he is experiencing some resistance
from his banker in getting more cash to increase his investment in inventories to meet an
anticipated increase in sales. In the past, Brown has used only simple decision rules for
ordering from his suppliers. He orders a 3-week supply of SKUs that cost more than $10
per unit and a 6-week supply of items that cost less than $10 per unit. Last year, May-Bee’s
average inventory was around $1,000,000. He paid $19,500 interest on his bank loan,
$80,000 rent for his warehouse, and $15,000 to insurance companies. Brown believes that
it would be proﬁtable to increase his bank loan because he feels that he could probably
earn 14–15% on the borrowed money. The following six items represent 30% of May-Bee’s
annual dollar sales volume and according to Brown are his bread and butter:
SKU Number

Brown gets directly involved with the ordering of imported items because for these
items he has to go to the bank to get a letter of credit and on the average spends about
60 minutes per order for doing so. An order for imported items had in the past included
from 1 to 10 SKUs. The table below gives a summary of the costs involved in placing an
order. These estimates were supplied by the persons involved, who guessed at the amount

4A.3 Cost Penalty Incurred by Using EOQ When There Is a Finite
Replenishment Rate
Recall from Equation 4.19 that the optimal order quantity for the case when the replenishment
rate is ﬁnite can be expressed as the EOQ times a correction factor of 1/√1 −D/m. Figure 4.8
plots this correction factor as well as the PCP incurred when using the EOQ. To make this PCP
calculation, we ﬁrst ﬁnd the percentage deviation in quantity p as follows:
EOQ = (1 + p)FREOQ

√1 −D/m

1 −D/m = (1 + p)
p =

Using this value for p, we can apply the percentage deviation in quantity from the PCP formula in
Equation 4.10.

which is the lognormal approximation of the exchange curve of TACS versus N. The exact
exchange curve is
(TACS)N = 406,500,000
The latter was developed by a complete item-by-item computation. The lognormal approxi-
mation of Equation 4A.15 falls a negligible amount above the exact curve—such a small amount
that one would have diﬃculty in discerning any diﬀerence between the curves.

Chapter 5
Lot Sizing for Individual Items
with Time-Varying Demand
In Chapter 4, we developed the economic order quantity (EOQ) (and various modiﬁcations of it)
by essentially assuming a level, deterministic demand rate. In this chapter, we relax this assumption
and allow the average demand rate to vary with time. In a manner similar to Chapter 4, here, we
focus on settings where replenishment quantities are not constrained by capacity. We analyze the
implications of ﬁnite capacity extensively in Chapters 13 through 15. As compared to the EOQ
setting, the time-varying demand situations addressed in this chapter encompass a broader range
of practical situations, including:
1. Multiechelon assembly operations where a ﬁrm schedule of ﬁnished products, exploded
back through the various assembly stages, leads to production requirements at these earlier
levels. These requirements are relatively deterministic but almost always vary appreciably
with time. (This is a topic to which we return in Chapter 15 under the heading of Material
Requirements Planning, or Material Resources Planning [MRP].)
2. Production to contract, where the contract requires that certain quantities have to be
delivered to the customer on speciﬁed dates.
3. Items having a seasonal demand pattern. (Artiﬁcial seasonality can be induced by pricing or
promotion actions.)
4. Replacement parts for an item that is being phased out of operation. Here, the demand rate
drops oﬀwith time. (In some cases, particularly toward the end of its life, such an item is
better treated by the Class C procedures to be discussed in Chapter 8.)
5. More generally, items with known patterns in demand that are expected to continue.
6. Parts for preventive maintenance where the maintenance schedule is accurately known.
This topic has been termed lot sizing in the academic and practitioner literatures.
In Section 5.1, we point out how much more complex the analysis becomes when we allow
the demand rate to vary with time. Section 5.2 introduces three diﬀerent approaches, namely: (1)
straightforward use of the EOQ (even though one of the key assumptions on which it is based
is violated), (2) an exact optimal procedure, and (3) an approximate heuristic method. In Sec-
tion 5.3, the assumptions common to all three approaches are laid out, as well as a numerical
199

Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
example to be used for illustrative purposes throughout Sections 5.4 through 5.6. Further details
on each of the three approaches are presented in Sections 5.4, 5.5, and 5.6, including a discus-
sion of when to use each method. In Section 5.7, we describe a procedure for handling quantity
discounts when demand varies with time. Then, in Section 5.8, we again focus our attention on
aggregate considerations by means of the exchange curve concept.
5.1 The Complexity of Time-Varying Demand
When the demand rate varies with time, we can no longer assume that the best strategy is always to
use the same replenishment quantity; in fact, this will seldom be the case. (A similar diﬃculty arose
in Chapter 4 when economic factors changed with time, such as the conditions of inﬂation or a
special opportunity to buy.) An exact analysis becomes very complicated because the diagram of
the inventory level versus time, even for a constant replenishment quantity, is no longer the simple
repeating sawtooth pattern that we saw in Figure 4.1 of Chapter 4. This prevents us from using
simple average costs over a typical unit period as was possible in the EOQ derivation. Instead, we
now have to use the demand information over a ﬁnite period, extending from the present, when
determining the appropriate value of the current replenishment quantity. This period is known
as the planning horizon and its length can have a substantial eﬀect on the total relevant costs of
the selected strategy. Moreover, all other factors being equal, we would prefer to have the planning
horizon as short as possible; the farther into the future we look for demand information, the less
accurate it is likely to be.
It should be kept in mind, however, that in actual applications, a rolling schedule procedure
is almost always used. Speciﬁcally, although replenishment quantities may be computed over the
entire planning horizon, only the imminent decision is implemented. Then, at the time of the next
decision, new demand information is appended to maintain a constant length of horizon. This
topic is discussed in depth in Chapter 15 when we present one of the primary applications of lot
sizing, or materials resources planning (MRP).
As indicated by the examples of time-varying demand discussed earlier, the demand can be
either continuous with time or can occur only at discrete equispaced points in time. The former
represents a stream of small-sized demands where the arrival rate varies with time, whereas the latter
corresponds to something such as weekly shipments where a large demand quantity is satisﬁed at
one time. The decision system that we propose is not aﬀected by whether the demand is continuous
or discrete with respect to time; all that will be needed is the total demand in each basic period.
A common case is one in which the demand rate stays constant throughout a period, only changing
from one period to another. An illustration is shown in Figure 5.1. As discussed in Chapter 3,
demand forecasts are usually developed in this form, for example, a rate in January, another rate in
February, and so on.
Another element of the problem that is important in selecting the appropriate replenishment
quantities is whether replenishments must be scheduled at speciﬁed discrete points in time (e.g.,
replenishments can only be scheduled at intervals that are integer multiples of a week), or whether
they can be scheduled at any point in continuous time. Considering a single item in isolation,
the second case is probably more appropriate if the demand pattern is continuous with time.
However, to ease scheduling coordination problems in multi-item situations, it usually makes
sense to limit the opportunity times for the replenishment of each item. Furthermore, if the
demand pattern is such that all the requirements for each period must be available at the begin-
ning of that period, it is appropriate to restrict the replenishment opportunities to the beginnings

of periods. This latter assumption will be made in developing the logic of the decision system
that we propose. (The case where replenishments can take place at any time has been treated by
Silver and Meal 1969.)
Still another factor that can materially inﬂuence the logic in selecting the replenishment quan-
tities is the duration of the demand pattern. A pattern with a clearly speciﬁed end resulting from
a production contract is very diﬀerent from the demand situation where no well-deﬁned end is
in sight. In the former case, it is important to plan to reach the end of the pattern with a low (if
not zero) level of the inventory. In contrast, for the continuing demand situation, if we use a ﬁnite
planning horizon, there is no need to force the solution to include a low inventory level at the end
of the horizon. The remaining inventory can be used in the interval beyond the horizon, where
demand will continue (albeit, at a possibly diﬀerent rate).
5.2 The Choice of Approaches
There are essentially three approaches to dealing with the case of a deterministic, time-varying
demand pattern:
1. Use of the basic EOQ. This is a very simple approach. Use a ﬁxed EOQ, based on the average
demand rate out to the horizon, anytime a replenishment is required. As would be expected,
this approach makes sense when the variability of the demand pattern is low; that is, the
constant demand rate assumption of the ﬁxed EOQ is not signiﬁcantly violated.
2. Use of the exact best solution to a particular mathematical model of the situation. As we will see,
under a speciﬁc set of assumptions, this approach, known as the Wagner–Whitin algorithm,

202
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
minimizes the total of certain costs. (For reasons that will become evident later in the chapter,
we purposely avoid the use of the words “total relevant costs” here.)
3. Use of an approximate or heuristic method. The idea here is to use an approach that captures
the essence of the time-varying complexity but at the same time remains relatively simple for
the practitioner to understand, and does not require lengthy computations.
Many MRP systems oﬀer a variety of approaches, although the most common is the EOQ, or
some other ﬁxed order quantity. These systems do not typically recommend an approach. Rather,
the user must specify which technique to use. The discussion in this chapter, as well as in Chapter
15, should help inform these decisions.
5.3 General Assumptions and a Numerical Example
5.3.1 The Assumptions
We now specify a number of assumptions that will be made (at least implicitly) in all three of these
approaches. Certain of these assumptions can be relaxed by somewhat minor modiﬁcations of the
decision methodology; such modiﬁcations will be demonstrated later.
1. The demand rate is given in the form of D(j) to be satisﬁed in period j (j = 1, 2, . . . , N),
where the planning horizon is at the end of period N. Of course, the demand rate may
vary from one period to the next, but it is assumed as known. The case of probabilistic,
time-varying demand will be addressed in Chapter 7.
2. The entire requirements of each period must be available at the beginning of that period.
Therefore, a replenishment arriving partway through a period cannot be used to satisfy
that period’s requirements; it is cheaper, in terms of the reduced carrying costs, to delay
its arrival until the start of the next period. Thus, replenishments are constrained to arrive at
the beginnings of periods.
3. The unit variable cost does not depend on the replenishment quantity; in particular, there
are no discounts in either the unit purchase cost or the unit transportation cost.
4. The cost factors do not change appreciably with time; in particular, inﬂation is at a negligibly
low level.
5. The item is treated entirely independently of other items; that is, the beneﬁts from joint
review or replenishment do not exist or are ignored.
6. The replenishment lead time is known with certainty (a special case being zero duration) so
that delivery can be timed to occur right at the beginning of a period.
7. No shortages are allowed.
8. The entire order quantity is delivered at the same time.
9. For simplicity, it is assumed that the carrying cost is only applicable to the inventory that is
carried over from one period to the next. It should be emphasized that all the three approaches
can easily handle the situation where carrying charges are included on the material during the
period in which it is used to satisfy the demand requirements but, for practical purposes, this
is an unnecessary complication.
These assumptions, except for 1, 2, and 9, are identical with those required in the derivation
of the basic EOQ (as seen in Section 4.1 of Chapter 4). There are problems associated with these

■
203
assumptions, as discussed in Chapter 4. Nevertheless, the methods described below provide a good
starting point for most of the useful techniques.
Because of the assumption of deterministic demand, it is clear, from assumptions 2, 6,
and 7, that an appropriate method of selecting replenishment quantities should lead to the
arrival of replenishments only at the beginning of periods when the inventory level is exactly
zero.
5.3.2 A Numerical Example
A plant in Germany uses the following simple decision rule for ascertaining production run quan-
tities: “Each time a production run is made, a quantity suﬃcient to satisfy the total demand in
the next 3 months is produced.” A Canadian subsidiary of the German ﬁrm is the only customer
of the German plant for a seasonal product PSF-007, a 25-by-30-cm lithographic ﬁlm. The basic
unit of the product is a box of 50 sheets of ﬁlm. Canadian requirements by month (shifted to take
into account of the shipping time) in the upcoming year are given in Table 5.1:*
We can see that the demand pattern has two peaks, one in late spring, and the other in autumn.

* These requirements are often termed “net requirements” because any inventory on hand and on order is “net-
ted out” before determining the requirements. We shall assume that there is no inventory on hand or on
order. Equivalently, we could assume that any initial inventory has been “netted out.” For example, an ini-
tial inventory level of 50 and January requirements of 60 would produce the same net requirements shown in
Table 5.1.

Total replenishment costs = 4 × $54 =

Total carrying costs = 1,118 box-months × $20/box × 0.02 $/$/month =
$447.20
Total replenishment plus carrying costs =
$663.20
The German plant estimates the ﬁxed setup cost (A) per replenishment to be approximately
$54, and the carrying charge (r) has been set by the management at 0.02 $/$/month. The unit
variable cost (v) of the ﬁlm is $20/box.*
The production-planning department of the German plant would like to establish the size of
the ﬁrst production run (that was needed by January 1), and also estimate the timing and sizes of
future production quantities. The word “estimate” is used because the Canadian subsidiary could
conceivably revise its requirements, particularly those late in the year, but still give adequate time
to permit adjustment of the later portions of the production schedule.
The use of the company’s “3 month” decision rule leads to the replenishment schedule and
the associated costs shown in Table 5.2. There are four replenishments covering the 12 months
out to the horizon. The total relevant costs are $663.20. The average month-ending inventory is
1,118/12 or 93.17 boxes. Therefore, the turnover ratio is 1,200/93.17 or 12.9.
5.4 Use of a Fixed EOQ
When the demand rate is approximately constant, we have advocated, in Chapter 4, the use of the
basic EOQ. One possible approach to the case of a time-varying rate is to simply ignore the time
variability, thus continuing to use the EOQ. (An alternative, closely related, approach is to use a
ﬁxed time supply equal to the EOQ time supply, TEOQ. This approach will be discussed further
in Section 5.6.2.) To be more precise, the average demand rate ( ¯D) out to the horizon (N periods),
or to whatever point our forecast information extends, is evaluated and the EOQ
EOQ =

2A ¯D
vr
* See Rachamadugu and Schriber (1995) for an analysis of “changing the givens”—speciﬁcally, ﬁnding the best run
size when setup times decrease because of learning. See also Diaby (1995) and Tzur (1996).

Lot Sizing for Individual Items with Time-Varying Demand

205
is used anytime a replenishment is needed. Actually ¯D can simply be based on a relatively infrequent
estimate of the average demand per period and need not necessarily be reevaluated at the time of
each replenishment decision. To account for the discrete opportunities to replenish, at the time of a
replenishment the EOQ should be adjusted to exactly satisfy the requirements of an integer number of
periods. A simple way to do this is to keep accumulating periods of requirements until the closest
total to the EOQ is found. As discussed in Section 5.1, and as we will see in more detail in
Section 5.5, it is desirable to plan to receive a replenishment order when the inventory is low (or
zero) as this keeps inventory holding costs down. Alternatively, the quantity can be ﬁxed, ensuring
that the factory ﬂoor always sees the same production quantity. While this will lead to an increase
in inventory holding costs, there may be eﬃciencies in production, packaging, shipping, or similar
activities associated with always producing the same quantity.
To illustrate, for our numerical example,
¯D = Total requirements
12 months
= 100 boxes/month
Therefore,
EOQ =

2 × $54 × 100 boxes/month
$20/box × 0.02$/$/month ≈164 boxes
Consider the selection of the replenishment quantity at the beginning of January. The following
table is helpful:

March

Cumulative requirements to the

214
The EOQ of 164 boxes lies between 84 and 214, and 214 is closer to 164 than is 84. Therefore,
the ﬁrst replenishment quantity is 214 boxes, lasting through the end of April. The detailed results
of applying the ﬁxed EOQ approach to the numerical example are as shown in Table 5.3. We
can see from Tables 5.2 and 5.3 that the ﬁxed EOQ approach, compared to the company’s “three
month” rule, reduces the total of replenishment and carrying costs from $663.20 to $643.20 or
about 3%, a rather small saving. The turnover ratio has been increased from 12.9 to 1,200×12/528
or 27.3, but the replenishment costs have also increased.
5.5 The Wagner–Whitin Method: An “Optimal” Solution
under an Additional Assumption
Wagner and Whitin (1958), in a classic article, developed an algorithm that guarantees an opti-
mal (in terms of minimizing the total costs of replenishment and carrying inventory) selection of

replenishment quantities under the set of assumptions that were listed in Section 5.3.1.* They also
identiﬁed one additional assumption that may be needed—namely, that either the demand pattern
terminates at the horizon or else the ending inventory must be prespeciﬁed.†
5.5.1 The Algorithm
The algorithm is an application of dynamic programming, a mathematical procedure for solving
sequential decision problems.‡
The computational eﬀort, often prohibitive in dynamic programming formulations, is signiﬁ-
cantly reduced because of the use of two key properties (derived by Wagner and Whitin) that the
optimal solution must satisfy:
Property 1 A replenishment only takes place when the inventory level is zero (previously
discussed in Section 5.3).
Property 2 There is an upper limit to how far before a period j we would include its require-
ments, D(j), in a replenishment quantity. Eventually, the carrying costs become so high that
it is less expensive to have a replenishment arrive at the start of period j than to include its
requirements in a replenishment from many periods earlier.
Suppose we deﬁne F(t) as the total costs of the best replenishment strategy that satisﬁes the
demand requirements in periods 1, 2, . . . , t. To illustrate the procedure for ﬁnding F(t) and the
* In this chapter, we focus on the case where demand is deterministic. See for example, Sox et al. (1997), Vargas
(2009), and Kang and Lee (2013) for extensions to the stochastic demand setting.
† The Appendix to this chapter contains additional details of the Wagner–Whitin model, including an integer-
programming formulation as well as the dynamic programming model.
‡ The problem here is a sequential decision problem because the outcome of the replenishment quantity decision
at one point has eﬀects on the possible replenishment actions that can be taken at later decision times; for
example, whether or not we should replenish at the beginning of March depends very much on the size of the
replenishment quantity at the beginning of February. Vidal (1970) provides an equivalent linear-programming
formulation and an associated eﬃcient solution procedure. See also Federgruen and Tzur (1991, 1994, 1995),
Heady and Zhu (1994), and Wagelmans et al. (1992). Pochet and Wolsey (2006) discuss the techniques for
improving the eﬃciency for numerous production-planning models.

Total = 1,200
F(1) is the total costs of a replenishment of size 10 at the start of January, which is simply the
setup cost A or $54. To determine F(2), we have two possible options to consider:
Option 1 Replenish 10 boxes at the start of January and 62 boxes at the start of February.
Option 2 Replenish enough (72 boxes) at the start of January to cover the requirements of both
January and February.
Costs of Option 1 = (Costs of best plan from the start to the end of January) + (Costs of a
replenishment at the start of February to meet February’s requirements)
= F(1) + A
= $54 + $54
= $108
Costs of Option 2 = (Setup cost for January replenishment) + (Carrying costs for February’s
requirements)
= $54 + 62 boxes × $0.40/box/month × 1 month

208
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
= $54 + $24.80
= $78.80
The cost of the second option is less than that of the ﬁrst. Therefore, the best choice to satisfy
the requirements of January and February is Option 2 and F(2) = $78.80.
To satisfy requirements through to the end of March, there are three options, namely, where
we position the last replenishment:
Option 1 Cover to the end of February in the best possible fashion and replenish 12 boxes at the
start of March.
Option 2 Cover to the end of January in the best possible fashion and replenish 74 boxes at the
start of February.
Option 3 Have a single replenishment of 84 boxes at the start of January.
Costs of Option 1 = F(2) + A
= $78.80 + $54
= $132.80
Costs of Option 2 = F(1) + A + (Carrying costs for March’s requirements)
= $54 + $54 + (12 × 0.40 × 1)
= $112.80
Costs of Option 2 = A + (Carrying costs for February’s requirements) + (Carrying costs for
March’s requirements)
= $54 + (62 × 0.40 × 1) + (12 × 0.40 × 2)
= $88.40
Therefore, Option 3, a single replenishment at the start of January, is best in terms of meeting
requirements through to the end of March.
We continue forward in this fashion until we complete period N (here N = 12). For any
speciﬁc month t, there are t possible options to evaluate. It is important to note that the method,
as just described, requires an ending point where it is known that the inventory level is to be at
zero or some other speciﬁed value.
To illustrate the eﬀect of property 2 discussed at the beginning of this section, consider the
options open to us in terms of meeting requirements through to the end of July (month 7). The
discussion in the previous paragraph would indicate that we must evaluate seven options. However,
consider the requirements of 88 boxes in the month of July. The carrying costs associated with these
requirements, if they were included in a replenishment at the beginning of June, would be
88 boxes × $0.40/box/month × 1 month or $35.20
Similarly, if these requirements were instead included in a replenishment at the beginning of
May, the carrying costs associated with the 88 units would be
88 boxes × $0.40/box/month × 2 months or $70.40

209
which is larger than $54, the ﬁxed cost of a replenishment. Therefore, the best solution could never
have the requirements of July included in a replenishment at the beginning of May or earlier. It
would be less expensive to have a replenishment arrive at the beginning of July. Thus, we need to
consider only two options—namely, having the last replenishment at the start of either June or
July.
If we were interested in computing the size of only the ﬁrst replenishment quantity, then, it
may not be necessary to go all the way out to the horizon (month N). The use of property 2 shows
that, if for a period j, the requirements D(j) are so large that the cost of carrying the inventory
needed to meet D(j) (for one period) exceeds the cost of a replenishment,
D(j)vr > A
or equivalently,
D(j) > A/vr
then the optimal solution will have a replenishment at the beginning of period j; that is, the
inventory must go to zero at the start of period j. Therefore, the earliest j where this happens can
be used as a horizon for the calculation of the ﬁrst replenishment. In the numerical example,
A/vr =
$54
$20/boxes × 0.02$/$/month = 135 box −months
We can see from the demand pattern that the earliest month with D(j) > 135 is May. Therefore,
the end of April can be considered as a horizon in computing the replenishment quantity needed
at the beginning of January. It should be emphasized that it is possible for a given problem instance
that all per-period requirements are below this threshold.
Table 5.4 illustrates a simple spreadsheet used to calculate the optimal solution. Notice that,
because of the ease of computation on the spreadsheet, we have included all possible production
levels for each month, even though we could have eliminated certain values based on the insights
from the previous paragraph. Notice also how the minimum value in the column for month 12 is
highlighted. The underlined values represent the number of months of production. For instance,
the underline from month 12 to month 11 (or $501.20 to $484.80) indicates that production
in month 11 will meet the requirements in months 11 and 12. The next step is to look for the
minimum value in month 10 (which again is highlighted), and underline values to the left, if
possible. Continuing in this manner, we develop the results shown in Table 5.5.
There are seven replenishments and the total costs amount to $501.20. Comparison with
Tables 5.2 and 5.3 shows that the Wagner–Whitin algorithm produces the total costs that are
some 24.4% lower than those of the company’s three-month rule and some 22.1% lower than
those of a ﬁxed EOQ strategy. Furthermore, the turnover ratio has been increased to 1,200 ×
12/308 or 46.8.
5.5.2 Potential Drawbacks of the Algorithm
As mentioned earlier, the Wagner–Whitin algorithm is guaranteed to provide a set of replenishment
quantities that minimize the sum of replenishment plus carrying costs out to a speciﬁed horizon.
(In fact, a generalized form permits including backordering as well as replenishment costs that
depend on the period in which the replenishment occurs.) As we have seen, it is possible to develop

spreadsheet solutions to the dynamic programming model; and with linear programming add-
ins to spreadsheets, it is possible to use that formulation and ﬁnd an optimal solution. Modiﬁed
versions of the algorithm have been successfully implemented. See, for example, Potamianos and
Orman (1996). In general, however, the algorithm has received extremely limited acceptance in
practice. The primary reasons for this lack of acceptance are:
1. The relatively complex nature of the algorithm that makes it more diﬃcult for the
practitioner to understand than other approaches.
2. The possible need for a well-deﬁned ending point for the demand pattern. (This would
be artiﬁcial for the typical inventoried item where termination of demand is not expected
in the near future.) As shown above, such an ending point is not needed when there is
at least one period whose requirements exceed A/vr. Moreover, all information out to the
end point may be needed for computing even the initial replenishment quantity. In this
connection, considerable research eﬀort (see e.g., Eppen et al. 1969; Kunreuther and Morton
1973; Blackburn and Kunreuther 1974; Lundin and Morton 1975) has been devoted to
ascertaining the minimum required length of the planning horizon to ensure the selection of
the optimal value of the initial replenishment.
3. A related issue is the fact that the algorithm is often used in conjunction with MRP software.
Because MRP typically operates on a rolling schedule, the replenishment quantities chosen
should not change when new information about future demands becomes available. Unfor-
tunately, the Wagner–Whitin approach does not necessarily have this property (which Baker
(1989) deﬁnes as the insulation property). This is potentially a critical ﬂaw in this approach.*
4. The necessary assumption that replenishments can be made only at discrete intervals (namely,
at the beginning of each of the periods). This assumption can be relaxed by subdividing the
periods; however, the computational requirements of the algorithm go up rapidly with the
number of periods considered. (In contrast, the other two methods are easily modiﬁed to
account for continuous opportunities to replenish.)
* Sahin et al. (2013) review the literature on production planning with rolling horizons.

212
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
When taking into account of the total relevant costs, particularly including system control
costs, it is not at all surprising that the algorithm has received such limited acceptability. We do not
advocate its use for B items. (Let us not lose sight of the fact that, in this chapter, we are still talking
about this class of items as opposed to Class A items. For the latter, considerably more control
expense is justiﬁed because of the higher potential savings per item.) Instead, it is appropriate to
resort to simpler heuristic methods that result in reduced control costs that more than oﬀset any
extra replenishment or carrying costs that their use may incur.
5.6 Heuristic Approaches for a Significantly Variable
Demand Pattern
As indicated by the results in the previous two sections, the Wagner–Whitin approach does sub-
stantially better than a ﬁxed EOQ, at least for the illustrative numerical example. However, as
mentioned in Section 5.5.2, the Wagner–Whitin approach has drawbacks from the practitioner’s
standpoint. Therefore, the natural question to ask is: “Is there a simpler approach that will cap-
ture most of the potential savings in the total of replenishment and carrying costs?” A number
of researchers (see, e.g., Diegel 1966; DeMatteis 1968; Gorham 1968; Mendoza 1968; Silver and
Meal 1973; Donaldson 1977; Groﬀ1979; Karni 1981; Wemmerlöv 1981; Brosseau 1982; Free-
land and Colley 1982; Boe and Yilmaz 1983; Mitra et al. 1983; Bookbinder and Tan 1984; Baker
1989; Coleman and McKnew 1990; Triantaphyllou 1992; Teng 1994; Hariga 1995a; Goyal et al.
1996; Zhou 1996; Schulz 2011) have suggested various decision rules, some of which have been
widely used in practice.* In this section, we review several heuristics that, as we will ﬁnd, accom-
plish exactly what we desire. Moreover, in numerous test examples, some of these heuristics have
performed extremely well. Because they are so frequently seen in practice, we also discuss some
commonly used heuristics that perform less well.
As mentioned earlier, the ﬁxed EOQ approach should perform suitably when the demand
pattern varies very little with time. For this reason, we advocate the use of the somewhat more
complicated heuristics only when the pattern is signiﬁcantly variable. An operational deﬁnition of
“signiﬁcantly variable” will be given in Section 5.6.7.
We begin with the Silver–Meal (or least period cost) heuristic (see Silver and Meal 1973), using
it to illustrate the basic concepts. Then we brieﬂy describe other heuristics.
5.6.1 The Silver–Meal, or Least Period Cost, Heuristic
The Silver–Meal heuristic selects the replenishment quantity in order to replicate a property that
the basic EOQ possesses when the demand rate is constant with time, namely, the total relevant
costs per unit time for the duration of the replenishment quantity are minimized. If a replenishment
arrives at the beginning of the ﬁrst period and it covers requirements through to the end of the
Tth period, then, the criterion function can be written as follows:
(Setup cost) + (Total carrying costs to end of period T)
T
* Wee (1995) develops an exact solution to the problem of ﬁnding a replenishment policy for an item that faces
declining demand, and that deteriorates over time. See Hariga (1994), Ting and Chung (1994), Hariga (1995b),
Bose et al. (1995), and Chapter 8 as well. See Hill (1995) for the case of increasing demand, and Hariga (1996)
for the case of inﬂationary conditions.

This is a reasonable criterion and it has the desirable feature of not including, in the present
replenishment, a large requirement well in the future (inclusion of such a requirement would make
the “costs per unit time” measure too high). It is not diﬃcult to develop numerical examples in
which the use of the criterion does not lead to the overall optimal solution, particularly for the
case where the demand pattern has a well-deﬁned ending point. Fortunately, this is not a major
drawback because our primary concern is with demand patterns that do not have a clearly deﬁned
ending point in the near future. (This follows from our basic deﬁnition of Class B items.)
Because we are constrained to replenishing at the beginnings of periods, the best strategy must
involve replenishment quantities that last for an integer number of periods. Consequently, we can
think of the decision variable for a particular replenishment as being the time T that the replen-
ishment will last, with T constrained to integer values. The replenishment quantity Q, associated
with a particular value of T, is
Q =
T

j=1
D(j)
(5.1)
provided we set the time origin so that the replenishment is needed and arrives at the beginning of
period 1. According to the chosen criterion, we wish to pick the T value that minimizes the total
relevant costs per unit time of replenishment and carrying inventory over the time period T.
Let the total relevant costs associated with a replenishment that lasts for T periods be denoted
by TRC(T). These costs are composed of the ﬁxed replenishment cost A and the inventory carrying
costs. We wish to select T to minimize the total relevant costs per unit time, TRCUT(T), where
TRCUT(T) = TRC(T)
T
= A + carrying costs
T
(5.2)
If T = 1, there are no carrying costs (we only replenish enough to cover the requirements of
period 1), that is,
TRCUT(T) = A
1 = A
If the setup cost A is large, this may be unattractive when compared with including the second
period’s requirements in the replenishment, that is, using T = 2.
With T = 2, the carrying costs are D(2)vr, which are the cost of carrying the requirements
D(2) for one period. Therefore,
TRCUT(2) = A + D(2)vr
2
Now, the setup cost is apportioned across two periods, but a carrying cost is incurred. With
T = 3 we still carry D(2) for one period, but now we also carry D(3) for two periods. Thus,
TRCUT(3) = A + D(2)vr + 2D(3)vr
3
In this case, the setup charge is apportioned across three periods, but this may not be attractive
because of the added carrying costs.

Graph of the selection of T in the Silver–Meal heuristic.
The basic idea of the heuristic is to evaluate TRCUT(T) for increasing values* of T until, for
the ﬁrst time,
TRCUT(T + 1) > TRCUT(T)
that is, the total relevant costs per unit time start increasing. When this happens, the associated
T is selected as the number of periods that the replenishment should cover. The corresponding
replenishment quantity Q is given by Equation 5.1.
As evidenced by Figure 5.2, this method guarantees only a local minimum in the total relevant
costs per unit time, for the current replenishment. It is possible that still larger values of T would
yield still lower costs per unit time since we stop testing with the ﬁrst increase in costs per unit
time. We could protect against this eventuality by computing the ratio for a few more values of T,
but the likelihood of improvement in most real cases is small. Furthermore, let us not lose sight of
the fact that “costs per unit time for the ﬁrst replenishment” is only a surrogate criterion.
* When some of the D’s are zeros, we proceed as follows: Suppose D(j −1) > 0, D(j) > 0, D(j + 1) = 0, and
D(j + 2) > 0. We evaluate TRCUT(j −1), and then jump to TRCUT(j + 1), because a replenishment that
covers period j will also, trivially, cover the zero requirement in period j + 1.

It is conceivable that the TRCUT(T) may continue to decrease all the way out to T = N. This
says that it is appropriate to cover all the requirements out to the horizon with the current replen-
ishment. In such a case, it may be appropriate to cover an even longer period, but the heuristic is
unable to provide the answer without forecast information beyond period N.
Except for the unusual situation just described, the performance of the heuristic, in contrast
with the Wagner–Whitin algorithm, does not crucially depend on the N value chosen. It tends to
use demand data of only the ﬁrst few periods, an attractive property when one recognizes that the
deterministic demand assumption becomes less reasonable as one projects further into the future.
To illustrate the application of the heuristic, let us again use the numerical example of Section
5.3. As previously introduced, the values of A, v, and r and the ﬁrst part of the requirements pattern
are as follows:
A = $54
v = $20/box
r = 0.02 $/$/month

The calculations for the ﬁrst replenishment quantity (assuming that the inventory is zero at
the beginning of month 1) are shown in Table 5.6. The heuristic selects a T value of 3 with an
associated Q, using Equation 5.1, of
Q = D(1) + D(2) + D(3)
= 10 + 62 + 12
= 84 boxes
The table illustrates that the computations are simply multiplications, additions, divisions, and
comparisons of numbers.
It turns out for this numerical example (and for a substantial portion of all others tested) that
this simple heuristic gives the same solution as the Wagner–Whitin algorithm. Thus, the solution
has already been shown in Table 5.5.

Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
5.6.2 The EOQ Expressed as a Time Supply (POQ)
One approach described earlier (in Section 5.4) was to use a ﬁxed order quantity, based on using
the average demand rate in the EOQ equation. Empirically (see, e.g., Brown 1977), where there
is signiﬁcant variability in the demand pattern, better cost performance has been obtained by
proceeding slightly diﬀerently. The EOQ is expressed as a time supply using, namely,
TEOQ = EOQ
¯D
=

2A
¯Dvr
(5.3)
rounded to the nearest integer greater than zero. Then, any replenishment of the item is made large
enough to cover exactly the requirements of this integer number of periods. Another name for this
approach is the periodic order quantity (POQ). This approach has the advantage that arrivals of
orders to the factory ﬂoor are regular even though the order quantities will be diﬀerent from order
to order. Note that this is in contrast to the ﬁxed order quantity approach that has irregular timing,
but constant quantities.
For the numerical example of Section 5.3.2, Equation 5.3 gives
TEOQ =

2(54)
(100)(20)(0.02) = 1.64
which rounds to 2. The repeated use of a 2-period time supply in the example gives the total costs
of $553.60 as compared to $501.20 using the Silver–Meal heuristic.
5.6.3 Lot-for-Lot
Perhaps, the easiest approach is Lot-for-Lot (L4L), which simply orders the exact amount needed
for each time period. Thus, inventory holding costs are zero with L4L. Clearly, this approach is
not cost eﬀective when ﬁxed replenishment costs are signiﬁcant. For our example, the total costs
are 12 × $54 or $648. We mention L4L here only because it will reappear in the context of MRP
where it is commonly used. (See Chapter 15.)
5.6.4 Least Unit Cost
The Least Unit Cost (LUC) heuristic is similar to the Silver–Meal heuristic except that it accumu-
lates requirements until the cost per unit (rather than the cost per period) increases. Calculations
for the ﬁrst order are shown in Table 5.7.
Table 5.8 contains the results for the entire 12-month time. The total cost of $558.80 is 11.5%
higher than the optimal solution. Research has shown that this is not unusual performance for the
LUC heuristic.
5.6.5 Part-Period Balancing
The basic criterion used here is to select the number of periods covered by the replenishment such
that the total carrying costs are made as close as possible to the setup cost, A. (Exact equality is
usually not possible because of the discrete nature of the decision variable, T.) To illustrate, for the

the ﬁrst replenishment. Repeated use of this procedure gives replenishments listed in Table 5.9,
with the total costs of $600—again well above the $501.20 found by the Silver–Meal heuristic
(Table 5.5).

Reﬁnements of the part-period balancing (PPB) method, requiring more computational eﬀort,
have been developed (see e.g., DeMatteis 1968; Mendoza 1968). One reﬁnement is called the
Look-Ahead/Look-Back technique. The Look-Ahead technique evaluates the cost of moving an
order later in time. For instance, because the ﬁrst order of 84 units cannot be moved to period 2
without incurring a stockout, we ﬁrst examine the order for 284 units in period 4. If that order
were moved to period 5, the 130 units required in period 4 must be produced in period 1 and held
for 3 periods—at a cost of 130 units (or parts) × 3 periods = 390 part periods. The 154 units held
from period 4 to period 5 are saved—or 154 parts × 1 period = 154 part periods. Therefore, no
adjustment is made to that order. We come to a similar conclusion with the order for 217 units in
period 6: save 88 units for 1 period (or 88 part periods) at a cost of 129 units held for 2 periods
(or 258 part periods).
It is attractive to make an adjustment to the 176 units ordered in period 8. Moving that order
to period 9 requires shifting the 52 units needed in period 8 to the order in period 6—at a cost of
52 × 2 = 104 part periods. The cost of holding 124 units from period 8 to period 9 is saved—
124 × 1 = 124 part periods. So, the adjustment would be made; the order in period 6 would now
be 217 + 52 = 269 units, and the next order would be 124 units in period 9.
Unfortunately, Wemmerlöv (1983) has shown that the Look-Ahead/Look-Back techniques do
not necessarily improve the performance of the PPB heuristic. He also notes that the PPB heuristic
generally performs poorly in dynamic environments.
5.6.6 Performance of the Heuristics
Many of these heuristics have been tested against the Wagner–Whitin algorithm, the basic EOQ,
and other heuristics on a wide range of examples. Baker (1989) summarizes this literature and
reconciles the diﬀerences among diﬀerent papers. Van den Heuvel and Wagelmans (2010) analyze
the worst-case behavior of several lot-sizing heuristics. One lesson from all the literature is that
most heuristics outperform the ﬁxed EOQ approach. Another lesson, illustrated in Baker’s paper,
is that the Silver–Meal heuristic incurs an average cost penalty for using the heuristic instead of the
“optimal” Wagner–Whitin algorithm of less than 1%; in many cases there is no penalty whatsoever.
(See Table 5.10.) Finally, tests in a rolling-horizon environment (see, e.g., Blackburn and Millen
1980) have revealed that frequently the Silver–Meal heuristic actually outperforms the dynamic
programming algorithm (because the latter now gives the optimal solution to the wrong problem).

5.6.7 When to Use Heuristics
These heuristics, although quite simple, are still more involved than the determination of the basic
EOQ. We know that the latter is the best replenishment quantity to use when there is no variability
in the demand rate. In fact, the variability of the demand pattern should exceed some threshold
value before it makes sense to change to a heuristic.
A useful measure of the variability of a demand pattern is the squared coeﬃcient of variation.
This statistic, denoted by SCV, is given by
SCV =
Variance of demand per period
Square of average demand per period
which can be computed easily on a spreadsheet. Tests have shown that a threshold value of SCV
appears to be in the neighborhood of 0.2, that is, if SCV < 0.2, use a simple EOQ involving ¯D as
the demand estimate. If SCV ≥0.2, use a heuristic.
For the numerical example discussed in this chapter, we get SCV = 0.426, which is greater
than the threshold value indicating that a heuristic, rather than the EOQ, should be used. (Recall
from Tables 5.3 and 5.5 that the Silver–Meal heuristic produced total relevant costs of 22.1%
below those resulting from the use of the EOQ.)
In addition, consider the absolute importance of the item, in terms of the potential savings in
replenishment and carrying costs. A useful surrogate for this quantity is the total of these costs per
unit time under the use of the EOQ in the EOQ cost model (we know that the EOQ model is,
strictly speaking, only an approximation for the case of time-varying demand, but it is simple to
use), namely,

2A ¯Dvr
If this quantity was very small, departing from the simple EOQ decision rule would not be
justiﬁed. However, in this chapter, we are concerned with B items, deﬁned to be those with inter-
mediate values of ¯Dv. Thus, by deﬁnition, for such items, the above test quantity will be large
enough to ensure that we should not blindly remain with the basic EOQ when the demand rate
varies enough.
A word of caution is in order. There are two situations where the use of the heuristic can lead
to signiﬁcant cost penalties:
1. When the demand pattern drops rapidly with time over several periods.
2. When there are a large number of periods having no demand.

220
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
Silver and Miltenburg (1984) have suggested modiﬁcations of the heuristic to cope with these
circumstances. Baker (1989) also notes other heuristics that perform slightly better at little com-
putational cost. When unit production costs vary over time, the heuristic can also perform quite
poorly. ? develop an approximation that performs well in this case.
5.6.8 Sensitivity to Errors in Parameters
In Section 4.3 of Chapter 4, it was illustrated that, for the case of the basic EOQ, the total cost
curve is quite shallow in the neighborhood of the best order quantity. Thus, even substantial devia-
tions of the order quantity away from its best value tend to produce small percentage cost penalties.
One case of such deviations is errors in the parameter (cost or demand) values. We concluded that
the costs were relatively insensitive to errors in the input parameters for the case of the EOQ
formulation.
Fortunately, tests have revealed that a similar phenomenon exists for the Silver–Meal heuristic.
The results of one such test are shown in Figure 5.3. The basic data used (taken from Kaimann
1969) were

A/vr was deliberately changed from its correct value. For this incorrect value of A/vr, the
Silver–Meal heuristic was used to compute the replenishment quantities. The true value of A/vr
was then employed to compute the costs associated with this sequence of replenishments. These
costs were compared with those of the replenishment pattern resulting from using the correct value
of A/vr. This was repeated for a number of diﬀerent percentage errors in A/vr. To illustrate, in
Figure 5.3, we can see that if A/vr is erroneously set at a value of 40% that is too high (i.e., at a
value of 210 instead of the correct level of 150), then, the cost penalty is less than 2%. The plot
is not a smooth curve (as was the case in Figure 4.3 of Chapter 4) because here the replenishment
opportunities are discrete in nature. Nonetheless, in all cases tested, the percentage cost penalties,
even for reasonable-sized errors in A/vr, were quite small. Pan (1994) reaches the same conclusion.
5.6.9 Reducing System Nervousness
In a rolling-horizon environment, as new demand information becomes available, the timing and
sizes of future replenishments may be altered. Frequent alterations of this type may be unattractive
from an operational standpoint. Carlson et al. (1979) and Kropp et al. (1983) have introduced
the idea of a penalty cost for changing a previously established schedule; they have shown how
to incorporate this idea into the Silver–Meal heuristic and the Wagner–Whitin algorithm. As a
by-product, this modiﬁcation permits the handling of the situation where the setup cost varies
from period to period. See also Blackburn et al. (1986), Sridharan and Berry (1990), Sridharan
et al. (1987), Kropp and Carlson (1984), DeMatta and Guignard (1995), and Toklu and Wilson
(1995). We will have more to say on this topic in Chapter 15.
5.7 Handling of Quantity Discounts
An important extension of the heuristic is to permit the inclusion of quantity discounts. As in
Chapter 4, we illustrate for the case of an all-units fractional discount d if Q ≥Qb. The presence of
a discount removes the validity of one of the key properties of a solution ﬁrst mentioned in Section
5.5—namely, that replenishments are received only when the inventory level is 0. Sometimes, it
may indeed be appropriate to order exactly Qb, which need not cover precisely an integer number
of periods of requirements.
A revised heuristic, developed by Bregman and Silver (1993), involves a three-step procedure.
First, determine the value of T, the replenishment quantity expressed as a time supply, which gives
the lowest cost per period ignoring the discount possibility. Denote this lowest cost time supply,
T ′. If T ′ ≥Tb, where Tb is the time supply covered by a replenishment of size Qb, then T ′ is
used. The second step is needed if T ′ < Tb and it involves checking if the use of Tb (i.e., taking
advantage of the discount) is attractive. If so, the third step is to check if it is attractive to cover the
integer T value above Tb. More formally,
Step 1 Find the ﬁrst minimum ignoring the discount possibility.
Find the lowest integer T that gives a local minimum of

If TRCUT(T + 1) is less than or equal to TRCUT(T), continue trying T + 2, and so on. If
there is a D(T + 1) = 0, then, immediately compare TRCUT(T + 1) to TRCUT(T −1)
because TRCUT(T + 1) will always be less than TRCUT(T) in this situation. Denote the

Bregman and Silver (1993) have shown that this heuristic performs extremely well, and that its
computation time is quite small compared to other heuristics.
Other work on this topic includes Callarman and Whybark (1981), Benton (1983, 1985,
1991), La Forge (1985), Chung et al. (1987), Christoph and La Forge (1989), Federgruen and Lee
(1990), Bregman (1991), and Hariga (1995c). Hu et al. (2004) investigate heuristics for the incre-
mental quantity discount setting. They propose a modiﬁed version of the Silver–Meal heuristic that
works quite well, particularly when the horizon is not too short, on a large set of test problems.

5.8 Aggregate Exchange Curves
As has been discussed earlier in the book, certain parameter values, such as r or A/r, may be
selected implicitly by the top management; they specify a reasonable operating situation (such as an
inventory budget) for all items in the inventory. In Chapter 4, for the case of the basic EOQ, it was
relatively easy to develop an exchange curve because of the analytic relationships between (1) the
total average cycle stock and A/r (see Equation 4.29), and (2) the total number of replenishments
per unit time and A/r (see Equation 4.30).
For the case of time-varying demand, no such simple results exist because of the discrete nature
of the decision variable T, the number of periods of requirements to be included in a replenish-
ment. Therefore, in this case, in order to develop an exchange curve, we must proceed as follows.
A representative sample of items is selected from the population of items under considera-
tion. The exact sample size to select depends on the number and characteristics of items in the
population that are to be controlled by the replenishment batch size heuristic or algorithm (i.e.,
have a squared coeﬃcient of variation exceeding 0.2).
A value of A/r is selected. Then, for each item in the sample, the heuristic, say Silver–Meal, is
used to determine the replenishment quantities over a reasonable time period such as 12 months.
This implies a certain number of replenishments and an average inventory level (in dollars) for
the item. Summing these quantities across the items of the sample produces the total number of
replenishments and the total average inventory of the sample. These ﬁgures must be appropriately
scaled up to correspond with the total group of items to be controlled by the heuristic. This must
be repeated for several values of A/r to develop the tradeoﬀcurve.
An additional point is worth mentioning here. It is often desirable to have an exchange curve
for all the items in the population. In such a case, the results for the Silver–Meal heuristic items
must be added to those for the items to be replenished according to the basic EOQ (Section 4.10
of Chapter 4). This produces one composite curve as a function of A/r.
5.9 Summary
In this chapter, we have provided a decision system for coping with the relaxation of another of the
key assumptions inherent in the use of the basic EOQ. The system permits the practitioner to deal,
in a realistic way, with time-varying demand patterns. The Silver–Meal heuristic, as well as some
other approaches, has been found to be robust. A guideline has been provided to aid the decision
maker in choosing when to use the simple EOQ approach.
Time-varying demand patterns will play a crucial role in the Material Requirements Planning
framework to be discussed in Chapter 15. In addition, an extension of the Silver–Meal heuristic to
permit multiple items within a capacitated production context will be discussed in Chapter 10.
In the next chapter, we return to the context of an essentially level demand pattern but, for the
ﬁrst time, incorporate uncertainty in the demand rate. In Chapter 7, a brief mention will be made
of the treatment of the combination of time-varying and uncertain demand.

It is anticipated that demand for the next year will follow this pattern; hence, these
ﬁgures are being used as the “best estimates” of forthcoming sales. Demand will also con-
tinue in future years. The cost of these ﬁlters is $8.65, ordering costs are approximately $35,
and the carrying cost is 0.24 $/$/year.

These ﬁlters cost the company $4.75 each; ordering and carrying costs are as in Prob-
lem 5.1. The squared coeﬃcient of variation equals 0.33. Use the Silver–Meal heuristic to
determine the sizes and timing of replenishments of stock.

All the requirements of each month must be available at the beginning of the month.
Replenishments are restricted to the beginnings of the months. No shortages are allowed.
Using each of the following methods, develop the pattern of replenishments to cover the
12 months and the associated total costs of each pattern (do not bother to count the costs
of carrying D(j) during its period of consumption, namely, period j). In each case, the size
of the last replenishment should be selected to end month 12 with no inventory.
a. Fixed EOQ (rounded to the nearest integer number of months of supply; i.e., each time
the EOQ, based on the average demand through the entire 12 months, is adjusted so
that it will last for exactly an integer number of months).
b. A ﬁxed time supply (an integer number of periods) based on the EOQ expressed as a
time supply, using the average demand rate for the 12 months.
c. On each replenishment, the selection of Q (or, equivalently, the integer T), which
minimizes the costs per unit of quantity ordered to cover demand through T.
d. The Silver–Meal heuristic.
e. One replenishment at the start of month 1 to cover all the requirements to the end of
month 12.
f. A replenishment at the beginning of every month.
Hint: For each case, it would be helpful to develop a table with at least the following
columns: (1) Month, (2) Replenishment Quantity, (3) Starting Inventory, (4) Demand, and
(5) Ending Inventory.

A Calgary-based company (Piedmont Pipelines) has been awarded a contract to lay a long
stretch of pipeline. The planned schedule for the laying of pipe can be considered to be accu-
rately known for the duration of the project (18 months). Because of weather conditions
and the availability of labor, the rate of placement of the pipe is not constant throughout
the project. The supplier of the pipe oﬀers a discount structure for purchases. Outline an
analysis that would assist Piedmont in deciding on the purchase schedule for the piping.
5.8
Consider a population of items having essentially deterministic but time-varying demand
patterns. Suppose that one was interested in developing an exchange curve of total average
cycle stock (in dollars) versus the total number of replenishments per year as a function of
A/r (the latter being unknown, but constant for all the items). An analyst has suggested
using the approach of Section 4.10 with
Di = annual demand for item i
Discuss whether or not this is a reasonable suggestion.

Suppose you were a supplier for a single customer having a deterministic, but time-varying

mum discount that you would be willing to give the customer in return for him/her
maintaining his/her current pattern instead of providing a perfectly level demand
pattern. Assume that replenishments can take place only at the beginning of periods.
b. Illustrate for the numerical example of Problem 6.5. Suppose that the current selling
price is $60/unit.

In this chapter, we consider stocking problems in which stock is ordered in anticipation
of depletion by demand processes. A diﬀerent kind of problem arises in transportation
and distribution systems such as freight railroads, express and delivery services, freight for-
warders, etc., in which the inventory accumulates according to supply processes and is
depleted by dispatches. Consider such a dispatching problem, in which an inventory of dis-
similar items accumulates according to a time-varying process. A periodic review is assumed,
whereby at the end of each time period, there is an opportunity to dispatch, that is, to reduce
the inventory to zero. A cost trade-oﬀsimilar to the stocking problem is at issue, that is,
there are inventory holding costs, and a signiﬁcant, ﬁxed dispatching cost.
We suppose the system starts (at the beginning of period 1) with an initially empty
inventory (i.e., a dispatch cleared the system at the end of period 0). In the tth period, t =
1, 2, . . ., we let Wt denote the set of items supplied to the inventory whose ﬁrst opportunity
for dispatch is at the end of period t, and HC(Wt) shall denote the cost of holding items
Wt in the inventory for one period. (E.g., if the set of items Wt are kept in the inventory for
3 periods before dispatching, the associated holding costs are 3 HC(Wt)). We let A denote
the ﬁxed cost per dispatching event. A dispatching policy is desired, that is, a determination
in each time period of whether to dispatch or not dispatch in that period.

Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
a. Develop a decision procedure, such as the Silver–Meal heuristic, based on minimizing
the relevant costs per unit time between dispatch moments.
b. Illustrate your procedure (for just the ﬁrst two dispatches) with the following example
involving the dispatching of freight trains from a switchyard terminal:
At a terminal, freight cars with a particular destination W are switched to departure
tracks where they accumulate until a train to destination W is dispatched. The holding
costs per hour vary from car to car according to ownership, age, car type, etc., but we
suppose that an information system at the terminal allows the calculation of holding
costs for a given group of cars. Let Wt denote the set of cars destined to W switched in
hour t, and let HC(Wt) denote the hourly holding costs for Wt. We consider the case
where a train was dispatched to W just before hour 1, and the switching results of the
next several hours are as follows:

Consider an item where the assumptions of Section 5.3.1 are reasonable (including L = 0),
but with one important exception, namely that there is a signiﬁcant chance of the perisha-
bility of material kept too long in the inventory. Speciﬁcally, consider an order that arrives
at time 0 (the beginning of period 1). The units of this order can become unusable at the
end of each period that they are kept in stock. In particular, it is reasonable to assume
that, for any period, there is a ﬁxed chance p that any good inventory at the start of that
period, which is still left over at the end of the period, will not be usable for satisfying the
demand in future periods. Note that we are assuming that at the end of a period, one of
the two things happens: (1) all of the remaining inventory is still usable, or (2) all of the
remaining inventory has become worthless (with 0 salvage value). In the latter case, a new
replenishment must be immediately placed (remember L = 0) to avoid a shortage in the
next period. Assume that, if spoilage occurs right at the end of a period, then carrying costs
are still incurred for the (now useless) inventory carried over into the next period but that
this inventory is discarded before the end of that next period.
a. What should tend to happen to the best value of T as p increases?
b. Develop a heuristic decision rule (in the spirit of the Silver–Meal heuristic) for choosing
an appropriate order quantity at time 0. Use the notation consistent with the text. Make
sure that your heuristic gives reasonable results for the limiting cases of p = 0 and p = 1.
c. Illustrate your rule with the following numerical example (but only choose the ﬁrst-
order quantity, the one at time 0). Also, determine the order quantity that would
be found by the Silver–Meal heuristic (i.e., assuming p = 0) and comment on any
diﬀerence from the value obtained using the heuristic with p > 0.

Note: For simplicity, assume that m is large enough so that, if a replenishment is
initiated at the start of period j, then, the demand for period j, D(j), can be met from

ysis the carrying costs of D(j) during its period of consumption, j. To do this, assume
a uniform demand rate during any single period (without the extra cost included, the
ﬁnite replenishment rate would have no eﬀect on the decision).
b. For the item of Problem 5.4 suppose that m = 150 units/month. Now, use the modiﬁed

Chapter 6
Individual Items with
Probabilistic Demand
In the preceding two chapters, which dealt with the determination of replenishment quantities, the
decision rules resulted from analyses that assumed deterministic demand patterns. In several places,
we showed that the relevant costs associated with the selection of order quantities were relatively
insensitive to inaccuracies in the estimates of the various factors involved. However, the costs of
insuﬃcient capacity in the short run—that is, the costs associated with shortages or with averting
them—were not included in the analyses. When demand is no longer assumed to be deterministic,
these costs assume a much greater importance. Clearly, the assumption of deterministic demand is
inappropriate in many production and distribution situations. Therefore, this chapter is devoted
to the theme of how to develop control systems to cope with the more realistic case of probabilistic
demand. We initially restrict our attention to the case (comparable to Chapter 4) where the average
demand remains approximately constant with time. We address the more diﬃcult setting of time-
varying probabilistic demand in Chapter 7.
The introduction of uncertainty in the demand pattern signiﬁcantly complicates the inventory
situation from a conceptual standpoint. This, together with the plethora of the possible shortage-
costing methods or customer-service measures, has made the understanding and acceptance of
decision rules for coping with probabilistic demand far less frequent than is merited by the impor-
tance of the problem. It is safe to say (as will be illustrated in Section 6.11.2 of this chapter) that
in most organizations, an appropriate reallocation of buﬀer (or safety) stocks (which are kept to
meet the unexpected ﬂuctuations in demand) can lead to a signiﬁcant improvement in the service
provided to customers.
It should be emphasized that in this and several succeeding chapters, we are still dealing with a
single-stage problem. A control system diﬀerent from those proposed here is usually in order for a
multiechelon situation. We have more to say on this topic in Chapters 11 and 15.
We begin in Section 6.1 with a careful discussion of some important issues and terminology
relevant to the case of probabilistic demand. In Section 6.2, we return to the topic of classiﬁca-
tion of items into A, B, or C categories. In Section 6.3, the important dichotomy of continuous
versus periodic review is discussed. This is followed in Section 6.4 by an explanation of the four
most common types of control systems. Section 6.5 is concerned with the many diﬀerent ways of
237

238
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
measuring service or costing shortages that may be relevant to any particular stocking situation.
Section 6.6 deals with an illustrative selection of the reorder point for one type of continuous-
review system (order-point, order-quantity system). This section builds the conceptual foundation
for the remainder of the chapter. In Section 6.7, we present a detailed treatment of the order-point,
order-quantity system, showing the decision rules for a wide range of methods of measuring ser-
vice and costing shortages. Section 6.8 addresses the implied performance that is obtained when a
reorder point is chosen by a diﬀerent service or cost objective. Section 6.9 is more brieﬂy devoted
to another commonly used control system—namely, the periodic-review, order-up-to-level system.
This is followed, in Section 6.10, by a discussion of how to deal with appreciable variability in the
replenishment lead time. Finally, Section 6.11 presents exchange curves displaying the total buﬀer
stock plotted against the aggregate measures of service as a function of a policy variable; the policy
variable is the numerical value of a particular service level or shortage cost.
6.1 Some Important Issues and Terminology
6.1.1 Different Definitions of Stock Level
When demand is probabilistic, it is useful to conceptually categorize the inventories as follows:
1. On-hand (OH) stock This is stock that is physically on the shelf; it can never be negative. This
quantity is relevant in determining whether a particular customer demand is satisﬁed directly
from the shelf.
2. Net stock is deﬁned by the following equation:
Net stock = (On hand) −(Backorders)
(6.1)
This quantity can become negative (namely, if there are backorders). It is used in some
mathematical derivations and is also a component of the following important deﬁnition.
3. Inventory position (sometimes also called the available stock)* The inventory position is
deﬁned by the relation
Inventory position = (On hand) + (On order)
−(Backorders) −(Committed)
(6.2)
The on-order stock is that stock which has been requisitioned but not yet received by the
stocking point under consideration. The “committed” quantity in Equation 6.2 is required if
such stock cannot be used for other purposes in the short run. As we will see, the inventory
position is a key quantity in deciding when to replenish.
4. Safety stock (SS) The SS (or buﬀer) is deﬁned as the average level of the net stock just before
a replenishment arrives. If we planned to just run out, on the average, at the moment when
the replenishment arrived, the SS would be zero. A positive SS provides a cushion or buﬀer
against larger-than-average demand during the eﬀective replenishment lead time. Through-
out this book, we consistently use the deﬁnition provided here, although the appropriate
method of calculation, and thus the numerical value of the SS, depends on what happens to
* We have chosen to not use the words “available stock” because of the incorrect connotation that such stock is
immediately available for satisfying customer demands.

demands when there is a stockout. If no backorders are permitted, net stock (and thus SS) is
always nonnegative. With backorders, it is possible that SS, by the deﬁnition provided here,
could be negative.
6.1.2 Backorders versus Lost Sales
What happens to a customer’s order when an item is temporarily out of stock is of obvious
importance in inventory control. There are two extreme cases:
1. Complete backordering. Any demand, when out of stock, is backordered and ﬁlled as soon
as an adequate-sized replenishment arrives. This situation corresponds to a captive market,
common in government organizations (particularly the military) and at the wholesale–retail
link of some distribution systems (e.g., exclusive dealerships).
2. Complete lost sales. Any demand, when out of stock, is lost; the customer goes elsewhere
to satisfy his or her need. This situation is most common at the retail–consumer link. For
example, a person is unlikely to backorder a demand for a loaf of bread. We focus in this
chapter on single-item inventory control models, but it is worth noting that when multiple
items are available for purchase, a customer facing an out-of-stock situation may choose a
substitute product. This would clearly be a lost sale for the originally intended item, but may
aﬀect the anticipated demand.
In most practical situations, there is a combination of these two extremes, whereas most inven-
tory models have been developed for one or the other of the extremes. Nevertheless, most of these
models serve as reasonable approximations because the decisions they yield tend to be relatively
insensitive to the degree of backordering possible in a particular situation. This is primarily a con-
sequence of the common use in practice of high customer-service levels; high service levels imply
infrequent stockout occasions. When we use the term stockout, we mean a stockout occasion or
event. The number of units backordered or lost is a measure of the impact of the stockout.
We now show that the numerical value of the SS depends on the degree to which backorders
or lost sales occur. Consider a particular replenishment lead time in which a stockout occurs.
Under complete backordering, if demand occurs during the stockout, the net stock will be negative
just before the next replenishment arrives. On the other hand, if all demands that occur during
the stockout are lost, then, the net stock will remain at the zero level throughout the stockout
period. In other words, in a cycle when a stockout occurs, the value of the net stock just before the
replenishment arrives depends on whether backorders can occur. Because SS is deﬁned to be the
average net stock just before a replenishment arrives, its numerical value is inﬂuenced by whether
backordering is actually possible.
6.1.3 Three Key Issues to Be Resolved by a Control System under
Probabilistic Demand
The fundamental purpose of a replenishment control system is to resolve the following three issues
or problems:
1. How often the inventory status should be determined.
2. When a replenishment order should be placed.
3. How large the replenishment order should be.

240
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
Under the conditions of deterministic demand (discussed in the previous two chapters), the
ﬁrst issue is trivial because knowing the inventory status at any one point allows us to calculate it at
all points in time (at least out to a reasonable horizon). Furthermore, under deterministic demand,
the second problem is answered by placing an order such that it arrives precisely when the inventory
level hits some prescribed value (usually set at zero). Finally, under deterministic demand, the use
of the EOQ, one of its variations, or one of the procedures discussed in Chapter 5 provides the
solution to the third problem.
Under probabilistic demand, the answers are more diﬃcult to obtain. Regarding the ﬁrst point,
it takes resources (labor, computer time, etc.) to determine the inventory status. On the other hand,
the less frequently the status is determined, the longer is the period over which the system must
protect against unforeseen variations in demand in order to provide the desired customer service.
The answer to the second problem rests on a trade-oﬀbetween the costs of ordering somewhat early
(hence, carrying extra stock) and the costs (implicit or explicit) of providing inadequate customer
service. The factors relevant in answering the third problem are similar to those discussed in the
derivation of the basic EOQ, except that under some service criteria, speciﬁed by the management,
there is an interaction; the answer to the question “When to replenish?” may be aﬀected by the
replenishment quantity used.
To respond to these three fundamental issues, a manager must determine several things. We
pose these as four questions that managers can use to systematically establish inventory policies.
1. How important is the item?
2. Can, or should, the stock status be reviewed continuously or periodically?
3. What form should the inventory policy take?
4. What speciﬁc cost or service objectives should be set?
The next four sections address these four questions in turn.
6.2 The Importance of the Item: A, B, and C Classification
Managers must ﬁrst establish how critical the item under consideration is to the ﬁrm. As mentioned
in Chapter 2, many ﬁrms segment their items into the categories A, B, or C. Recall that A items
make up roughly 20% of the total number of items, but represent 80% of the dollar sales volume.
B items comprise roughly 30% of the items, but represent 15% of the dollar volume; C items
comprise roughly 50% of the items, and represent only 5% of the dollar volume. Firms often
include slow-moving and inexpensive items in the A category if the items are critical to the business.
It is possible that including many slow-moving or inexpensive items in the A category could shift
the typical 80–20 distribution, but our experience is that this is rarely the case.
The importance of the item helps direct the response to the remaining three questions. The
remainder of this chapter is devoted to B items. Chapter 7 covers A items, and Chapter 8 addresses
C items.
6.3 Continuous versus Periodic Review
The answer to the problem of how often the inventory status should be determined speciﬁes the
review interval (R), which is the time that elapses between two consecutive moments at which we

know the stock level. An extreme case is where there is continuous review; that is, the stock status is
always known. In reality, continuous surveillance is usually not required; instead, each transaction
(shipment, receipt, demand, etc.) triggers an immediate updating of the status. Consequently, this
type of control is often called transactions reporting. Point-of-sale (POS) data collection systems
(involving electronic scanners), which permit transactions reporting, are having a profound impact
at the retail level. With periodic review, as the name implies, the stock status is determined only
every R time units; between the moments of review, there may be considerable uncertainty as to the
value of the stock level. Even with POS scanning, inventory decisions are often made periodically
(e.g., end of the day). Thus, from the perspective of the inventory reordering decision, the review
period, R, is 1 day.
A common example of periodic-review systems is the soda machine in a dormitory. The driver
comes regularly, say once every week, to reﬁll the machine. If the machine stocks out of an item
between visits, no action is taken. As another example, note that some small ﬁrms assign one person
to review inventory and make purchase decisions. Often, this person is so busy that he or she can
allocate only one afternoon each week to perform these tasks. As these examples show, physical
constraints or limits on time often determine the review interval.
We now comment on the advantages and disadvantages of continuous and periodic review.
Items may be produced on the same piece of equipment, purchased from the same supplier, or
shipped in the same transportation mode. In any of these situations, coordination of replenish-
ments may be attractive. In such a case, periodic review is particularly appealing because all items
in a coordinated group can be given the same review interval (e.g., all items purchased from a
particular supplier might be scheduled for review every Thursday). Periodic review also allows a
reasonable prediction of the level of the workload on the staﬀinvolved. In contrast, under contin-
uous review, a replenishment decision can be made at practically any moment in time; hence the
load is less predictable. A rhythmic, rather than random, pattern is usually appealing to the staﬀ.
Another disadvantage of continuous review is that it is generally more expensive in terms of
reviewing costs and reviewing errors. This is particularly true for fast-moving items where there
are many transactions per unit of time. Today, POS data collection systems have dramatically
reduced reviewing costs and errors. For extremely slow-moving items, very little reviewing costs
are incurred by continuous review because updates are only made when a transaction occurs. On
the other hand, we have the anomalous condition that periodic review may be more eﬀective
than continuous review in detecting the spoilage (or pilferage) of such slow-moving items; periodic
review forces an occasional review of the situation, whereas, in transactions reporting, no automatic
review will take place without a transaction occurring.
The major advantage of continuous review is that, to provide the same level of customer service,
it requires less SS (hence, lower carrying costs) than does periodic review. This is because the
period over which safety protection is required is longer under periodic review (the stock level has
the opportunity to drop appreciably between review instants without any reordering action being
possible in the interim).
6.4 The Form of the Inventory Policy: Four Types
of Control Systems
Once the manager has determined whether the item falls in the A, B, or C category, and he or she
has settled the question of continuous versus periodic review, it is time to specify the form of the

242
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
inventory control policy. The form of the inventory policy will begin to resolve the second and
third issues: When should an order be placed and what quantity should be ordered.
There are a number of possible control systems. The physical operation of the four most com-
mon ones will be described in the next section, along with a brief discussion of the advantages and
disadvantages of each. Our discussion of the advantages and disadvantages will be rather general in
that they are dependent on the speciﬁc environment in which the systems are to be implemented.
6.4.1 Order-Point, Order-Quantity (s, Q) System
This is a continuous-review system (i.e., R = 0). A ﬁxed quantity Q is ordered whenever the inven-
tory position drops to the reorder point s or lower. Note that the inventory position, and not the
net stock, is used to trigger an order. The inventory position, because it includes the on-order
stock, takes proper account of the material requested but not yet received from the supplier. In
contrast, if net stock was used for ordering purposes, we might unnecessarily place another order
today even though a large shipment was due in tomorrow. A good example of ordering on the basis
of inventory position is the way a person takes medicine to relieve a headache. After taking the
medicine, it is not necessary to take more every 5 minutes until the headache goes away. Rather, it
is understood that the relief is on order.
The (s, Q) system is often called a two-bin system because one physical form of implementation
is to have two bins for storage of an item. As long as units remain in the ﬁrst bin, demand is satisﬁed
from it. The amount in the second bin corresponds to the order point. Hence, when this second
bin is opened, a replenishment is triggered. When the replenishment arrives, the second bin is
reﬁlled and the remainder is put into the ﬁrst bin. It should be noted that the physical two-bin
system will operate properly only when no more than one replenishment order is outstanding at
any point in time. Thus, to use the system, it may be necessary to adjust Q upward so that it is
appreciably larger than the average demand during a lead time.
The advantages of the ﬁxed order-quantity (s, Q) system include that it is quite simple, partic-
ularly in the two-bin form, for the stock clerk to understand, that errors are less likely to occur,
and that the production requirements for the supplier are predictable. The primary disadvantage
of an (s, Q) system is that in its unmodiﬁed form, it may not be able to eﬀectively cope with the
situation where individual transactions are large; in particular, if the transaction that triggers the
replenishment in an (s, Q) system is large enough, then, a replenishment of size Q won’t even raise
the inventory position above the reorder point. (As a numerical illustration, consider a Q value
of 10 together with a demand transaction of size 15 occurring when the position is just 1 unit
above s.) Of course, in such a situation, one could instead order an integer multiple of Q where
the integer was large enough to raise the inventory position above s.
6.4.2 Order-Point, Order-Up-to-Level (s, S) System
This system again assumes continuous review; and, like the (s, Q) system, a replenishment is made
whenever the inventory position drops to the order point s or lower. However, in contrast to the
(s, Q) system, a variable replenishment quantity is used, ordering enough to raise the inventory
position to the order-up-to-level S. If all demand transactions are unit sized, the two systems are
identical because the replenishment requisition will always be made when the inventory position
is exactly at s; that is, S = s + Q. If transactions can be larger than unit size, the replenishment
quantity in the (s, S) system becomes variable. The diﬀerence between (s, Q) and (s, S) systems is
illustrated in Figure 6.1. The (s, S) system is frequently referred to as a min-max system because

the inventory position, except for a possible momentary drop below the reorder point, is always
between a minimum value of s and a maximum value of S.
The best (s, S) system can be shown to have the total costs of replenishment, carrying inventory,
and shortage that are not larger than those of the best (s, Q) system. However, the computational
eﬀort to ﬁnd the best (s, S) pair is substantially greater. Thus, the (s, Q) may be the better choice,
except perhaps when dealing with an item where the potential savings are appreciable (i.e., an
A item). It is interesting that (s, S) systems are frequently encountered in practice. However, the
values of the control parameters are usually set in a rather arbitrary fashion. For B items (and even
most A items), mathematical optimality does not make sense; instead, we need a fairly simple way
of obtaining reasonable values of s and S. This will be discussed further in the next chapter, which
deals with A items. One disadvantage of the (s, S) system is the variable order quantity. Suppliers
could make errors more frequently; and they certainly prefer the predictability of a ﬁxed order
quantity, particularly if the predetermined lot size is convenient from a packaging or handling
standpoint (e.g., pallet, container, or truckload.)
6.4.3 Periodic-Review, Order-Up-to-Level (R, S) System
This system, also known as a replenishment cycle system, is in common use, particularly in com-
panies without sophisticated computer control. It is also frequently seen when items are ordered
from the same supplier, or require resource sharing. The control procedure is that every R units of

time (i.e., at each review instant) enough is ordered to raise the inventory position to the level S.
A typical behavior of this type of system is shown in Figure 6.2.
Because of the periodic-review property, this system is much preferred to order point systems
in terms of coordinating the replenishments of related items. For example, when ordering from
overseas, it is often necessary to ﬁll a shipping container to keep shipping costs under control. The
coordination aﬀorded by a periodic-review system can provide signiﬁcant savings. In addition, the
(R, S) system oﬀers a regular opportunity (every R units of time) to adjust the order-up-to-level S,
a desirable property if the demand pattern is changing with time. The main disadvantages of the
(R, S) system are that the replenishment quantities vary and that the carrying costs are higher than
in continuous-review systems.
6.4.4 (R, s, S) System
This is a combination of (s, S) and (R, S) systems. The idea is that every R units of time we
check the inventory position. If it is at or below the reorder point s, we order enough to raise it
to S. If the position is above s, nothing is done until at least the next review instant. The (s, S)
system is the special case where R = 0, and the (R, S) is the special case where s = S −1.
Alternatively, one can think of the (R, s, S) system as a periodic version of the (s, S) system. Also,
the (R, S) situation can be viewed as a periodic implementation of (s, S) with s = S −1.
It has been shown (see, e.g., Scarf 1960) that, under quite general assumptions concerning the
demand pattern and the cost factors involved, the best (R, s, S) system produces a lower total of
replenishment, carrying, and shortage costs than does any other system. However, the computa-
tional eﬀort to obtain the best values of the three control parameters is more intense than that

for other systems, certainly for class B items. Therefore, for such items, simpliﬁed methods often
are used to ﬁnd reasonable values (again, a topic we discuss in the next chapter). This system is
also more diﬃcult to understand than some of the previously mentioned systems. (R, s, S) sys-
tems are found in practice where R is selected largely for convenience (e.g., 1 day) even when
POS equipment permits continuous review of the inventory position.
Table 6.1 gives a simple rule of thumb for choosing the form of the policy. For C items, ﬁrms
generally use a more manual and simple approach (which can be equivalent to simple (s, Q) or
(R, S) systems). Less eﬀort is devoted to inventory management because the savings available are
quite small.
6.5 Specific Cost and Service Objectives
When demand (or delivery capability) is probabilistic, there is a deﬁnite chance of not being able to
satisfy some of the demand on a routine basis directly out of stock. If demand is unusually large, a
stockout may occur or emergency actions may be required to avoid a stockout. On the other hand,
if demand is lower than anticipated, the replenishment arrives earlier than needed and inventory
is carried. Managers have diﬀerent perspectives on how to balance these two types of risks. There
are four possible methods of modeling these management perspectives to arrive at appropriate
decision rules. The choice among these should be consistent with the customers’ perceptions of
what is important. For example, Kumar and Sharman (1992) describe a ﬁrm that sets diﬀerent
service objectives for diﬀerent items based on cost—higher cost items had higher service targets.
Their customers held more inventory of lower cost items, allowing the ﬁrm to adjust its policies
accordingly. It is critical, however, to recognize that a stockout of a $1 item could shut down a
customer’s operation.
1. SSs Established through the Use of a Simple-Minded Approach. These approaches typically
assign a common safety factor or a common time supply as the SS of each item. Although
more easily understood than most of the other procedures to be discussed, we will ﬁnd that
there is a logical ﬂaw in the use of these methods.
2. SSs Based on Minimizing Cost. These approaches involve specifying (explicitly or implicitly)
a way of costing a shortage and then minimizing the total cost. For instance, air freight may
be used to meet a customer demand, even though it costs more. Holding more inventory
reduces the probability that air freight will be required, but increases the inventory holding
cost. The cost-minimization approach trades oﬀthese costs to ﬁnd the lowest cost policy. Of
the many alternative ways of costing a shortage, several will be illustrated shortly. As discussed
in Chapter 2, it is important to include only the relevant costs.
3. SSs Based on Customer Service. Recognizing the severe diﬃculties associated with costing
shortages, an alternative approach is to introduce a control parameter known as the service

246
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
level. The service level becomes a constraint in establishing the SS of an item; for example,
it might be possible to minimize the carrying costs of an item subject to satisfying, routinely
from stock, 95% of all demands. Again, there is considerable choice in the selection of a
service measure. In fact, often in practice, an inventory manager, when queried, may say that
company policy is to provide a certain level of service (e.g., 95%) and yet not be able to
articulate exactly what is meant by service. Later, we illustrate several of the more common
service measures.
4. SSs Based on Aggregate Considerations. The idea of this general approach is to establish the SSs
of individual items, using a given budget, to provide the best possible aggregate service across
a population of items. Equivalently, the selection of the individual SSs is meant to keep the
total investment in stocks as low as possible while meeting a desired aggregate service level.
6.5.1 Choosing the Best Approach
Unfortunately, there are no hard-and-fast rules for selecting the appropriate approach and/or mea-
sure of service. Which one to use depends on the competitive environment of the particular
company. For instance, if the products are in the mature phase of the product life cycle, competi-
tion is often based on cost and delivery performance. The presence of many competitors suggests
that the cost of a lost sale is simply the lost contribution margin of that sale. Knowing the explicit
cost of a shortage allows the ﬁrm to minimize inventory costs (or maximize proﬁt). On the other
hand, if the products are relatively new to the market, delivery performance may have signiﬁcant
implications for capturing market share; cost is less important. Managers in these cases tend to
set stringent service targets. Other factors that can inﬂuence this decision include the amount of
substitutability of products (i.e., standardized vs. customized products), whether the products are
purchased or manufactured, and how the company actually reacts to an impending shortage—for
example, does it expedite? In every case, managers should focus on customer needs and desires.
Many ﬁrms formulate service objectives and work hard to meet them, only to discover that their
service objectives are not consistent with what their customers’ desire.
Later, we will see equivalencies between certain service measures and methods of costing short-
ages (a further reference on this topic is Boylan and Johnston 1994). Moreover, it is quite possible
that diﬀerent types of shortage penalties or service measures are appropriate for diﬀerent classes of
items within the same organization.
Our treatment in this section is not meant to be exhaustive; rather, we wish to present the
more common measures used in establishing SSs. Because of the wide variety of options for estab-
lishing SSs, we provide a summary guide in Table 6.2. We shall show later in the chapter that
some of the criteria listed in Table 6.2 are similar to one another (e.g., P2 and B3; B2 and TBS),
or equivalent (e.g., B1 and expected total stockout occasions per year [ETSOPY]; B2, expected
total value of shortages per year [ETVSPY], and TBS). As we have said elsewhere in this chap-
ter, it is not necessary precisely to prescribe the numerical value of a shortage cost or service
level.
Finally, the reader should now be aware that maximizing turnover (i.e., minimizing the level
of inventories), in itself, is an inadequate criterion for selecting SSs in that it does not take into
account of the impact of shortages.
6.5.2 SSs Established through the Use of a Simple-Minded Approach
We illustrate with two of the most frequently used approaches.

6.5.2.1 Equal Time Supplies
This is a simple, commonly used approach. In fact, a large U.S.-based international consulting
ﬁrm estimates that 80%–90% of its clients use this approach for setting SS levels. The SSs of a
broad group of (if not all) items in an inventory population are set equal to the same time supply;
for example, reorder any item when its inventory position minus the forecasted lead time demand
drops to a 2-month supply or lower. This approach is seriously in error because it fails to take into
account of the diﬀerence in the uncertainty of forecasts from item to item. In applying this policy
to a number of items, the policy variable is the common number of time periods of supply. In
other words, all items in the group have SS set to the same number of periods of supply. One of
the authors has worked with a fastener manufacturer that was required by a major U.S. automotive
assembler to hold 2 weeks of forecasted demand as SS. This policy worked reasonably well for the
assembler, but did not prevent stockouts of items with highly variable demand, and it certainly did
not optimize inventory costs.

6.5.2.2 Equal Safety Factors
As we will see later, it is convenient to deﬁne the safety stock as the product of two factors as
follows:
SS = kσL
(6.3)
where k is called the safety factor and σL, as ﬁrst deﬁned in Chapter 3, is the standard deviation of
the errors of forecasts of total demand over a period of duration L (the replenishment lead time).
The equal-safety factors approach uses a common value of k for a broad range of items.
6.5.3 SSs Based on Minimizing Cost
We present four illustrative cases.
6.5.3.1 Specified Fixed Cost (B1) per Stockout Occasion
Here, it is assumed that the only cost associated with a stockout occasion is a ﬁxed value B1,
independent of the magnitude or duration of the stockout. This cost arises when a ﬁrm expedites
to avert an impending stockout.
6.5.3.2 Specified Fractional Charge (B2) per Unit Short
Here, one assumes that a fraction B2 of unit value is charged per unit short; that is, the cost per
unit short of an item i is B2vi, where vi is the unit variable cost of the item. A situation where this
type of costing would be appropriate is where units short are made during overtime production
(costing a per unit premium).
6.5.3.3 Specified Fractional Charge (B3) per Unit Short per Unit Time
The assumption here is that there is a charge B3 per dollar short (equivalently, B3v per unit short)
per unit time. An example would be where the item under consideration is a spare part and each
unit short results in a machine being idled (with the idle time being equal to the duration of the
shortage).
6.5.3.4 Specified Charge (B4) per Customer Line Item Short
In this case, there is a charge B4 for each customer line item backordered. A customer line item is
one of perhaps many lines of a customer’s order. Therefore, if a customer orders 10 items, but only
nine are in stock, the supplier is short of one customer line item. The assumption here is that there
is a charge B4 per line item short. Many ﬁrms impose such penalty payments on their suppliers
through a service-level agreement. We revisit the implications of such service-level agreements in
Chapter 12.
6.5.4 SSs Based on Customer Service
The following are among the more common measures of service.

Individual Items with Probabilistic Demand
■
249
6.5.4.1 Specified Probability (P1) of No Stockout per Replenishment Cycle:
Cycle Service Level
Equivalently, P1 is the fraction of cycles in which a stockout does not occur. A stockout is deﬁned
as an occasion when the OH stock drops to the zero level. As we will see later, using a common P1
across a group of items, is equivalent to using a common safety factor k. P1 service is often called
the cycle service level.
6.5.4.2 Specified Fraction (P2) of Demand to Be Satisfied Routinely
from Available Inventory: Fill Rate
The ﬁll rate is the fraction of customer demand that is met routinely; that is, without backorders
or lost sales. This form of service has considerable appeal to practitioners (particularly where a
signiﬁcant portion of the replenishment lead time is unalterable; e.g., a branch warehouse where
the major part of the lead time is the transit time by rail car). It can be shown under certain
conditions that the use of the B3 shortage-costing measure leads to a decision rule equivalent to
that for the P2 service measure, where the equivalence is given by the relation
P2 =
B3
B3 + r
(6.4)
with r, as earlier, being the carrying charge.*
6.5.4.3 Specified Fraction of Time (P3) during Which Net Stock Is Positive:
Ready Rate
The ready rate is the fraction of time during which the net stock is positive; that is, there is some
stock on the shelf. The ready rate ﬁnds common application in the case of equipment used for
emergency purposes (e.g., military hardware or bank computer system). Under Poisson demand,
this measure is equivalent with the P2 measure. Solving for the optimal inventory policy in this
case is more complex in general than for other service measures, and will not be pursued in this
chapter. See Schneider (1981) for a discussion of the ready rate and other service measures. Hopp
et al. (1999) employ this service measure, using approximations similar to those developed in this
chapter, for a distribution center that stocks 30,000 parts.
6.5.4.4 Specified Average Time (TBS) between Stockout Occasions
Equivalently, one could use the reciprocal of TBS, which represents the desired average number of
stockout occasions per year. If each stockout occasion is dealt with by an expediting action, then, a
speciﬁc TBS value can be selected to result in a tolerable number of expediting actions.
Boylan and Johnston (1994) deﬁne other service measures, including a fraction of order lines
ﬁlled, and illustrate the relationships among them. See also Aardal et al. (1989). A generalization
of the ﬁll rate is the fraction of demand that must be met within a speciﬁed time (see Problem 6.8
as well as Van der Veen 1981, 1984). Another generalization is the fraction of demand met in each
* This relationship holds when all unmet demand is backlogged and speciﬁc assumptions are made about how
demand occurs over time. See Rudi et al. (2009).

Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
period, rather than as a long-run average. See Chen and Krass (1995). Song (1998) investigates the
order ﬁll rate, or the probability that an entire customer order, composed of possibly more than
one item, is met from the shelf. See also Ernst and Pyke (1992). Rudi et al. (2009) investigate how
the method of inventory accounting (continuous-time vs. end-of-period accounting) aﬀects the
appropriate service-level choice.
6.5.5 SSs Based on Aggregate Considerations
We present two common methods of establishing SSs based on aggregate considerations. In both
cases, rather than just aggregating cost or service eﬀects across individual items, the item-level mea-
sure can be weighted by a factor known as the essentiality of the item. For example, if a particular
item was deemed twice as important as another from the perspective of inventory availability, then,
it essentiality would be double that of the other item.
6.5.5.1 Allocation of a Given Total Safety Stock among Items
to Minimize the ETSOPY
As will be shown in Section 6A.4 of the Appendix of this chapter, allocating a ﬁxed total safety
stock (TSS) among several items to minimize the expected total number of stockout occasions per
year leads to a decision rule for selecting the safety factor of each item based on B1. In fact, the
decision rule is identical with that obtained by assuming a value (the same for all items) of B1, and
then selecting the safety factor to keep the total of carrying and stockout costs as low as possible.
This allocation interpretation is probably more appealing to management.
6.5.5.2 Allocation of a Given TSS among Items to Minimize the ETVSPY
It can be shown that allocating a ﬁxed TSS among a group of items to minimize the ETVSPY (in
dollars) leads to a decision rule for selecting the safety factor that is identical with either
1. The one obtained by assuming a value (the same for all items) of the factor B2 and then
selecting the safety factor for each item to minimize the total of carrying and shortage costs.
2. The one obtained by specifying the same average time (TBS) between stockout occasions for
every item in the group.
Again, this aggregate view of allocating a limited resource may be considerably more appeal-
ing to management than attempting to explicitly ascertain a B2 value or the somewhat arbitrary
speciﬁcation of a TBS value.
6.6 Two Examples of Finding the Reorder Point s
in a Continuous-Review, Order-Point,
Order-Quantity (s, Q) System
We now present a simple illustration of the use of SS to protect against a stockout over a replenish-
ment lead time. Then, we use an empirical distribution to build intuition about the operation of
an (s, Q) system. In Section 6.7, we will present decision rules for a broad range of service measures
and methods of costing shortages.

Individual Items with Probabilistic Demand
■
251
6.6.1 Protection over the Replenishment Lead Time
In a continuous-review system, a replenishment action can be taken immediately after any demand
transaction. Once we place an order, a replenishment lead time (L) elapses before the order is
available for satisfying customer demands. Therefore, we want to place an order when the inventory
is still adequate to protect us over a replenishment lead time. If the order is placed when the
inventory position is at exactly the reorder point s, then, a stockout will not occur by the end of
the lead time if and only if the total demand during the lead time is less than the reorder point. If
the expected demand over the lead time is exactly equal to s, and the lead time demand distribution
is symmetric, we would expect to stock out in half of all replenishment cycles. If s is larger than the
expected lead time demand, we will stock out less often, but we will carry more inventory. Because
SS is deﬁned as the average level of net stock just before a replenishment order arrives, SS will be
positive if s is larger than the expected lead time demand. This is illustrated in Figure 6.3, where, for
simplicity in presentation, we have assumed that at most one replenishment order is outstanding
at any moment. In the ﬁgure, the reorder point is 40 units. In the ﬁrst lead time shown, the total
demand is 18 so that the net stock just before the replenishment arrives is (40 −18) or 22; that
is, no stockout occurs. In contrast, in the second lead time, the total demand is 47, resulting in a
total backorder of (47 −40) or 7 units when the replenishment arrives.
Note that above, we assumed that the replenishment action is taken when the stock level is
exactly at the reorder point s. Even for the situation of continuous review, this may not necessarily
be the case. To illustrate, suppose at a certain moment the stock level for the item in Figure 6.3 was
42 units and a demand transaction of 5 units occurred. This would immediately drive the inventory
level to 37 units, which is an undershoot of the reorder point by 3 units. It is evident that, strictly
speaking, no stockout occurs if and only if the sum of the undershoot and the total demand in
s = 40

Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
the replenishment lead time is less than the reorder point. Except where explicitly noted otherwise,
we make the simplifying assumption that the undershoots are small enough to be neglected. We
explicitly consider undershoots in the next chapter.
This, and the subsequent, discussion assumes that the manager will not take expediting action
when faced with an impending stockout. In other words, the replenishment lead time is ﬁxed and
cannot be changed. In many cases, however, it is possible to expedite some or all of the replenish-
ment order. If the cost of expediting is low relative to the cost of carrying the inventory, managers
should carry less inventory and expedite more often. Likewise, if the cost of expediting is low rel-
ative to the cost of stocking out, managers should provide very high service by expediting when
necessary. When expediting is expensive, however, more inventory should be carried, and it may
be optimal to provide somewhat lower service. See Moinzadeh and Nahmias (1988) for extensions
to the standard (s, Q) policy for this case. Also, see Moinzadeh and Schmidt (1991) for the case
in which Q = 1. Jain et al. (2010, 2011) investigate the impact of the capability to expedite on
continuous- and periodic-review models, respectively, and Veeraraghavan and Scheller-Wolf (2008)
develop an easily implementable policy for a periodic review inventory system with two modes of
supply.
6.6.2 An Example Using a Discrete Distribution
To develop intuition, we now present a stylized example using a discrete demand distribution. We
will formalize the treatment of some of these issues in the next section, where we present a more
realistic demand distribution. In answering the four questions introduced in Section 6.1, assume
that we have a B item, and that it is possible to review the inventory status continuously. Based on
Table 6.1, we choose an (s, Q) policy. The lead time demand distribution is presented in Table 6.3.
Assume that the lead time is 1 week, and that the order quantity is 20 units. We can see from
the demand distribution that the expected demand per week (or per lead time) is 2.2 units.* Thus,
if the ﬁrm operates for 50 weeks per year, the annual demand is 50(2.2) = 110 units.
Let us also assume that the ﬁrm has established that the ﬁxed cost per order, A, is $18, and
the cost per unit of inventory held per year is $10. Furthermore, assume that all unmet demand
is lost rather than backordered. This will simplify our example as net stock for this setting must

be nonnegative. If we wanted to achieve a cycle service level, P1, of 90%, it is evident from the
lead time demand distribution that a reorder point of 4 is necessary to be certain that no stockout
occurs in (at least) 90% of replenishment cycles. A reorder point of 3 would provide a P1 of only
80%. Thus, if the P1 requirement were, say, 75%, a reorder point of 3 would be suﬃcient.
Now, let us consider in more detail a shortage-costing method using the cost per unit short,
B2v where the ﬁrm has established that B2v is $20. The total annual cost is comprised of ordering
cost, holding cost, and shortage cost.
6.6.2.1 Ordering Cost
First, let us determine how many orders are placed each year. In a similar fashion to Chapter 4, the
number of orders (or replenishment cycles) per year is
Annual demand/Order size = 110/20 = 5.5 orders per year
Because the cost per order is $18, the annual ﬁxed cost of ordering is $18(5.5) = $99. See
Section 6A.6 of the Appendix to the chapter for a more technical discussion on ﬁnding the expected
costs.
6.6.2.2 Holding Cost
To determine the holding cost, we refer to aspects of the development of the EOQ from Chapter 4.
Recall that the inventory level follows the familiar sawtooth of Figure 6.4. The average inventory
OH, in that simple case, is Q/2. Now, when we add the possibility of SS and probabilistic demand,

the picture looks more like Figure 6.5. Intuitively, imagine the sawtooth of Figure 6.4 ﬂoating on
a “buﬀer”—which we call SS. Hence, we can informally suggest that the average inventory OH is
Q/2 + safety stock. (We shall present a more formal treatment in the next section.)
Now we know that Q/2 is 20/2 = 10. But what is the SS? For the moment, let the reorder
point, s, be 2. Then when lead time demand is 0, we will have 2 units left when the replenishment
order arrives. When lead time demand is 1 unit, we will have 1 unit left. When lead time demand
is 2, 3, or 4, there is no OH inventory when the replenishment arrives. Since no backorders are
allowed, OH inventory and net stock are the same. Table 6.4 ﬁlls out the details.
Thus, the safety stock, or the expected amount OH (or net stock) just before the replenishment
arrives, is 0.4 units ((0.1)(2) + (0.2)(1)). So the expected annual holding cost is
(Q/2 + SS)($10 per unit) = (10.4)($10) = $104

if X is the lead time demand.
6.6.2.3 Shortage Cost
To determine the shortage cost, we need to establish how many units we would expect to be short
in each replenishment cycle; and we follow an approach similar to that for the holding cost. If
s is 2, and lead time demand is 0, there will be no shortages. This occurs with probability 0.1. If
demand is 3, say, we will be one unit short. Again, a simple table describes the events (Table 6.5).
Notice that when lead time demand is 2, and the reorder point is 2, there are no shortages.
No customers are turned away without having their demand satisﬁed, even though there is no
inventory left when the replenishment order arrives. The expected number of units short in a cycle
is therefore 0.6 units. Because there are 110/20 = 5.5 cycles per year, and the cost per unit short
is $20, the expected annual shortage cost is
(Expected number of units short per cycle) (Number of cycles per year)
(Cost per unit short) = (0.6)(5.5)($20) = $66
Note that we could express expected units short as

6.6.2.4 Total Cost
The total annual cost is therefore $99 + $104 + $66 = $269. We can now search for the optimal
value of s. These equations and search can be easily implemented on a spreadsheet. The results are
given in Table 6.6. We can see that the optimal reorder point is 4.
There are several weaknesses of the simple procedure illustrated here:

1. Demand information is rarely presented in the manner described in this section. If it is, there
is a good chance that the right tail of the distribution (extremely high demand events) will
not be adequately represented, unless we have information from a considerable number of
historical lead times. Because service levels are often high, it is this right tail that is the most
important. Thus, this simple procedure may not be accurate. (We will have more to say about
a similar procedure in Section 6.10.)
2. If the replenishment lead time changes, for some reason, the current information about lead
time demand would be of limited value. (We will have more to say about changing the givens
in Section 6.7.1.)
To help overcome these weaknesses, it is helpful to ﬁt a member of a family of probability dis-
tributions to the available data. In the next section, we do this for the so-called normal probability
distribution. Nevertheless, the basic ideas presented in this section are the conceptual foundation
for the more formal and extensive treatment presented next.
6.7 Decision Rules for Continuous-Review, Order-Point,
Order-Quantity (s, Q) Control Systems
As discussed in Section 6.5, there is a wide choice of criteria for establishing SSs. The choice of a
criterion is a strategic decision, to be executed on a relatively infrequent basis and involving senior
management directly (the exchange curves of Section 6.11 will be helpful in this regard). Once
a criterion (and the implied associated decision rule) is chosen, there is then the tactical issue of
the selection of a value of the associated policy variable (e.g., choosing that the target value of P2
should be 98%).
Besides the choice of a suitable criterion, there is also a choice of the probability distribution
of lead time demand. As discussed in Section 3.5.5, from a pragmatic standpoint, we recommend,
at least for most B items, the use of a normal distribution of lead time demand. In Section 6.7.14,
we discuss the use of other distributions. In particular, we will see that the Gamma distribution can
be used almost as easily as the Normal to ﬁt demand during lead time and may be a better choice
in certain circumstances.
The assumptions, notation, general approach to the selection of the reorder point, and the
portion of the derivation of the rules common to all criteria will be presented prior to showing the

Individual Items with Probabilistic Demand

individual decision rules. Further details of some of the derivations can be found in the Appendix
of this chapter.
6.7.1 Common Assumptions and Notation
There are a number of assumptions that hold independent of the method of costing shortages or
measuring service. These include:
1. Although demand is probabilistic, the average demand rate changes very little with time.
Although this assumption may appear to be somewhat unrealistic, note that the decision
rules can be used adaptively (i.e., the parameters are updated with the passage of time). The
situation where the demand rate changes over time is addressed further in Section 7.6.
2. A replenishment order of size Q is placed when the inventory position is exactly at the order
point s. This assumption is tantamount to assuming that all demand transactions are of unit
size or else that the undershoots of the order point are of negligible magnitude compared with
the total lead time demand. (In Chapter 7, we will consider a situation where the undershoots
are not neglected.)
3. If two or more replenishment orders for the same item are simultaneously outstanding, then,
they must be received in the same order in which they were placed; that is, crossing of orders
is not permitted. A special case satisfying this assumption is where the replenishment lead
time is a constant.
4. Unit shortage costs (explicit or implicit) are so high that a practical operating procedure will
always result in the average level of backorders being negligibly small when compared with
the average level of the OH stock. In practice, this is not a very limiting assumption since, if
the level of backorders far exceeds the average OH stock, we are really managing a make (or
buy)-to-order business rather than a make-to-stock business.
5. Forecast errors have a normal distribution with no bias (i.e., the average value of the error
is zero) and a known standard deviation σL for forecasts over a lead time L. In actual fact,
as discussed in Chapter 3, the forecast system only provides us with an estimate ˆσL of σL.
However, extensive simulation studies by Ehrhardt (1979) have revealed that performance
is not seriously degraded by using ˆσL instead of σL (see Problem 6.5). (Recall that we use
the standard deviation of forecast errors rather than the standard deviation of the true lead
time demand distribution.) Appendix II, at the end of the book, is devoted to a discussion of
the normal distribution, and a graphical representation of a typical distribution is shown in
Figure 6.6.
6. Where a value of Q is needed, it is assumed to have been predetermined. In most situations,
the eﬀects of the two decision variables, s and Q, are not independent; that is, the best value of
Q depends on the s value, and vice versa. However, as will be shown in Chapter 7, where we
will take a closer look at the simultaneous determination of the two control parameters, the
assumption of Q being predetermined without the knowledge of s makes very good practical
sense, particularly for B items. See also Zheng (1992) and Axsäter (1996).
7. The operating costs of the control system do not depend on the speciﬁc value of s
selected.
Throughout the book, we have been emphasizing the possibility, and requirement, to “change
the givens.” In Chapter 4, we noted that there are many ways to reduce the optimal order quantity,
such as the use of technological infrastructure (such as EDI) to eﬀectively reduce the ordering cost.

Here, we comment on ways to reduce SS by changing the givens. It will become evident below
that some of the important drivers for the amount of SS are the replenishment lead time, the vari-
ability of demand, and the service level required. Many ﬁrms have focused (rightly) on reducing
SS by reducing the replenishment lead time. Choosing a supplier that is closer to your facility and
shipping via a faster transportation mode such as air freight are the two ways of reducing this lead
time. Improving forecast accuracy and providing customer incentives for speciﬁc purchase times
and quantities are examples of eﬀective ways to reduce demand variability. Occasionally, it is pos-
sible to reduce the required service level by better understanding customer needs and expectations.
Once again, our recommendation is to optimize inventory levels given the parameters as they are;
and then devote resources to changing the givens. We shall see in Section 6.11.2 that in many
cases, it is possible to reduce inventory costs, and improve the service, simultaneously. This is why
we suggest initially optimizing inventory levels before applying resources to changing the givens.
Then, however, managers should focus attention on reducing inventories by removing the reasons
for them.
The common notation includes:
D = demand per year in units/year.
Gu(k) = a special function of the unit normal (mean 0, standard deviation 1) variable.* Gu(k)
is used in ﬁnding the expected shortages per replenishment cycle (ESPRC). See
Equation 6.6 for intuition on this function.
* Gu(k) or pu≥(k) can be obtained from k, or vice versa, using a table lookup (a table of the unit normal
distribution is shown in Appendix II) or a rational approximation presented in Appendix III. Also, as dis-
cussed in Appendix III, pu≥(k) can also be obtained on Excel spreadsheet from Microsoft: given k, pu≥(k) =
1 −NORMSDIST(k). Given pu≥(k), k = NORMSINV(1 −pu≥(k)).

k = safety factor.
L = replenishment lead time, in years.
pu≥(k) = probability that a unit normal (mean 0, standard deviation 1) variable takes on a value
of k or larger. (A graphical interpretation of pu≥(k) is shown in Figure 6.6.) Note that
pu≥(k) is often expressed as 1 −(k), where (k) is the cumulative distribution
function (or the left tail) of the unit normal evaluated at k.
Q = prespeciﬁed order quantity, in units.
r = inventory carrying charge, in $/$/year.
s = order point, in units.
SS = safety stock, in units.
v = unit variable cost, in $/unit.
ˆxL = forecast (or expected) demand over a replenishment lead time, in units.
σL = standard deviation of errors of forecasts over a replenishment lead time, in units.
6.7.2 General Approach to Establishing the Value of s
In Section 6.6.2, we set about directly determining the required reorder point s. Here, it will turn
out to be more appropriate to work indirectly using the following relationships:
Reorder point, s = ˆxL + (Safety stock)
(6.7)
and
Safety stock = kσL
(6.8)
where k is known as the safety factor. The determination of a k value leads directly to a value of s
through the use of these two relations.*
The general logic used in computing the appropriate value of s (via k) is portrayed in Figure 6.7.
Of particular note is the manual override. The user should deﬁnitely have the option of adjusting
the reorder point to reﬂect factors that are not included in the model. However, care must be taken
to not again adjust for factors for which manual adjustments were already made as part of the
forecasting system (see Figure 3.1 of Chapter 3).
Figure 6.7 suggests specifying the lowest allowable value for k. Management must specify this
value because the inventory calculations may recommend, in eﬀect, holding no inventory at all.
When the shortage cost is lower than the inventory holding cost, for instance, the logical choice
would be to backorder Q customers and then ﬁll their demands with an order of size Q. However,
managers may resist providing such poor service. (It is not unlikely that, in this case, the shortage
cost was incorrectly speciﬁed.) Johnson et al. (1995) point out, however, that k can be negative
in multilevel distribution systems. Retailers hold buﬀer stocks, so that their supplier, a central
warehouse, is not required to provide high levels of service. In any case, managers may set a limit
on the service provided by specifying that k must be greater than, say, 0.
* The deﬁnition of safety stock in Equation 6.8 assumes that unmet demand is backlogged; thus, net stock can
be negative. Below, we discuss the adjustments to safety stock calculations when unmet demand is partially or
completely lost.

6.7.3 Common Derivation
Recall that an (s, Q) system operates in the following manner. Any time that the inventory position
drops to s or lower, a replenishment of size Q is placed. Because of the assumption of no crossing
of orders, if an order is placed at some time t when the inventory position is at level s, then, all
previous orders outstanding at that time must have arrived prior to the moment (call it t + L)
at which the current order arrives. Furthermore, any orders placed after the current one cannot
arrive before t + L. In other words, all of the inventory position of s units at time t, and no other
stock, must have reached the stocking shelf by time t + L. Therefore, the service impact of placing
the current order when the inventory position is at the level s is determined by whether the total
demand x in the replenishment lead time exceeds s. (If the OH level happens to be very low at
time t, a stockout may be incurred early in the replenishment cycle before an earlier outstanding
order arrives. However, this event is independent of the current replenishment, the one at time t,
and should not be considered in evaluating the consequences of using an order point s for the
current order.)

261
If the demand (x) in the replenishment lead time has a probability density function fx(x0)
deﬁned such that
fx(x0)dx0 = Pr{total demand in the lead time lies between x0 and x0 + dx0}
then the above arguments lead to the following three important results:
1. Safety stock is the expected net stock just before the replenishment arrives. If unmet demand
is backlogged,
SS =
∞
0
(s −x0)fx(x0)dx0 = s −ˆxL
(6.9)
This has a particularly simple interpretation for the case where no more than one order is ever
outstanding. The average OH inventory level just before a replenishment arrives is equal to
the inventory level when the replenishment is placed reduced by the average demand during
the lead time.
If unmet demand is lost (no backorders), net stock cannot be negative and an adjustment
must be made to the SS calculation:
E(OH just before a replenishment arrives) =
s
0
(s −x0)fx(x0)dx0
When expected unmet demand is small, the diﬀerence in the SS calculation from incorpo-
rating this adjustment is also small. We discuss in point 3 below how to operationalize this
adjustment.

(6.11)

Using the expression in Equation 6.11, we can develop an expression for SS for the lost sales case
mentioned in point 1 above.

= s −ˆxL + ESPRC
(6.12)
From here, we proceed assuming the simpler case of backlogged demand (with SS given by s −
ˆxL), but note that it is a simple adjustment to the SS expression (the inclusion of ESPRC) to
accommodate the lost sales case.
Now, the mean rate of demand is constant with time. Therefore, on average, the OH level
drops linearly during a cycle from (s −ˆxL + Q) right after a replenishment arrives to (s −ˆxL)
immediately before the next replenishment arrives. Thus
E(OH) ≈Q
2 + (s −ˆxL) = Q
2 + kσL
(6.13)
where, as mentioned earlier, we have chosen to express the safety stock as the multiple of two
factors:
SS = kσL
(6.14)
A useful graph of Equation 6.13 is shown in Figure 6.8. One other common feature, independent
of the service measure or shortage-costing method used, is the expected number of replenishments
per year. Each replenishment is of size Q and the mean rate of demand is D, as earlier. Therefore,
Expected number of replenishments per year = D
Q
(6.15)
To this point, the results hold for any probability distribution of lead time demand (or
forecast errors). To proceed further requires specifying the particular distribution. As shown in
Appendix II, when forecast errors are assumed to be normally distributed and the SS is expressed
as in Equation 6.14, then Equations 6.10 and 6.11 simplify to
Pr{stockout in a replenishment lead time} = pu≥(k)
(6.16)
and
ESPRC = σLGu(k)
(6.17)
At this point, the safety factor derivations diverge based on the particular shortage cost or service
measure used. Some illustrative details can be found in the Appendix of this chapter. We now turn

to the presentation of the individual decision rules. In each case, we ﬁrst present the rule. In most
cases, this is followed by a numerical illustration of its use, and then by a discussion of the behavior
of the rule in terms of how the safety factor k varies from item to item in a population of items.
As discussed in Section 6.5, there is a wide choice of criteria for establishing SSs; our treatment is
only meant to be illustrative of the many possibilities.
6.7.4 Decision Rule for a Specified Safety Factor (k)
Once a k value is speciﬁed, the choice of s immediately follows from Equations 6.7 and 6.8:
The Rule
Step 1 Safety stock, SS = kσL.
Step 2 Reorder point, s = ˆxL+SS, increased to the next higher integer (if not already exactly an
integer).
6.7.5 Decision Rule for a Specified Cost (B1) per Stockout Occasion
Two approaches to the derivation of the following rule are shown in Section 6A.1 of the Appendix
of this chapter. Here, we simply present the total cost function and then give the decision rule. The
total cost is again comprised of ordering, holding, and shortage costs. Relevant expected annual
ordering (or replenishment) and holding costs are, as before,
Cr = AD/Q

and
Cc =


vr
The expected stockout costs Cs per year are obtained by multiplying three factors together—
namely, (1) the expected number of replenishment cycles per year, (2) the probability of a stockout
per cycle, and (3) the cost per stockout. Thus, using Equations 6.15 and 6.16, we have
Cs =
D
Q

pu≥(k)B1
The total cost is the sum of these three terms. Because spreadsheets have the standard normal
distribution built in, computing the total cost for a given k is quite simple. Searching for the
optimal k is easy as well; but when there are thousands of items, it is useful to have a simple
decision rule:
Step 1 Is

where Q has been predetermined, presumably by one of the methods of Chapter 4, B1 is
expressed in dollars (or any other currency), and all the other variables (with units consistent
such that the left-hand side of the equation is dimensionless) are as deﬁned in Section 6.7.1.
If yes, then go to Step 2. If no, then continue with*

(6.20)
If Equation 6.20 gives a value of k lower than the minimum allowable value speciﬁed by the
management, then go to Step 2. Otherwise, proceed directly to Step 3.
Step 2 Set k at its lowest allowable value (speciﬁed by management).
Step 3 Reorder point s = ˆxL + kσL, rounded to the nearest integer (except raised to the next
highest integer if Step 2 was used).
6.7.5.1 Numerical Illustration
Suppose an item is one of a number for which a B1 value of $300 has been speciﬁed. Other relevant
characteristics of the item are
D = 200 units/year
Q = 129 units
* An alternative to the use of Equation 6.20 is to ﬁnd by a table lookup the k value that satisﬁes
fu(k) = QvσLr

(6.19)
where fu(k) is the probability density function of a unit normal variable evaluated at k. (See Table II.1 in

Step 3 (Step 2 is bypassed in this example.)
s = 50 + 2.41(21) = 101 units
The high value of B1 has led to a rather large safety factor.
6.7.5.2 Discussion
Notice in Figure 6.9 the behavior of the carrying, shortage, and total costs as k is varied from 1.3 to
3.3 for the numerical example.* Now suppose that σL is reduced from 21 to 7 units due to a closer
relationship with customers. The eﬀects of changing this “given” are shown graphically in the same
ﬁgure. (The shortage costs are the same for both values of σL, as are the ordering costs AD/Q.)
For k values greater than 1.7, the entire total cost curve for σL = 7 is below the low point of the
σL = 21 curve. In other words, reducing σL from 21 to 7, without much attempt to optimize over
k, is much more beneﬁcial than choosing the best value of k for σL ﬁxed at 21.
We can see from Equation 6.20 that k decreases as σL or v goes up. Intuitively, the behavior of
k with v makes sense under the assumed stockout-costing mechanism. If there is only a ﬁxed cost
per stockout occasion that is the same for all the items, then, it makes sense to allocate a greater
proportional SS to the less-expensive items where an adequate level of protection is achieved with
relatively little investment. Furthermore, as shown in Section 6A.1 of the Appendix of this chapter,
it follows from Equation 6.20 that k decreases as Dv increases (this is not obvious from a quick
look at the equations because both σLv and Qv depend on Dv). What this means is that higher
safety factors are provided to the slower-moving items.
The appearance of Q in the decision rule for ﬁnding the safety factor k indicates that a change
in Q will aﬀect the required value of the SS. Such eﬀects of Q were ignored in the derivations of
Chapter 4. For B items, this turns out to be a reasonable approximation, as we will see in Chapter 7,
where such interactions between Q and k will be more closely examined in the context of control
of A items.
* The total costs shown for both σL = 7, 21 include ordering cost AD/Q with A = $20.

There is no solution to Equation 6.20 when the condition of Equation 6.18 is satisﬁed. In such
a situation, as shown in the derivation in Section 6A.1 of the Appendix, the best solution is the
lowest allowable value of k. This situation may arise when B1 is low relative to vr; that is, when the
shortage cost is low relative to the holding cost.
Note that in establishing the reorder point in Step 3, we advocate rounding to the nearest
integer rather than always going to the next highest integer. This is because, in contrast with service
measures, here, we are not bound by a service constraint.

DB2
(6.22)
If the use of Equation 6.22 gives a k value lower than the minimum allowable safety factor
speciﬁed by the management, then go to Step 2. Otherwise, move to Step 3.
Step 2 Set k at its lowest allowable value.
Step 3 Reorder point, s = ˆxL + kσL, rounded to the nearest integer (except raised to the next
highest integer in the event that Step 2 has been used).
6.7.6.1 Numerical Illustration
A ﬁrm wishes to allocate a ﬁxed amount of SS among a number of products to keep the total value
of backorders per year as low as possible. Management feels that it is reasonable to use a B2 value
of 0.25; that is, each unit short incurs a cost equal to 25% of its unit value. The replenishment
quantity of an item under consideration has been predetermined at 85 units. This value is deter-
mined from annual demand of 200, a ﬁxed order cost of $21.50, a carrying charge of 20%, and a
unit cost of $6. Other quantities of interest include:
ˆxL = 50 units
σL = 10 units
Step 1
Qr

=
85 units × 0.2/year
200 units/year × 0.25 = 0.34 < 1
Then, Equation 6.22 gives
pu≥(k) = 0.34
From Table II.1 in Appendix II (or from the function NORMSINV(1–0.34) in Excel) k ≈
0.41 (presumably larger than the lowest allowable value, hence we go to Step 3).
Step 3
s = 50 + 0.41(10) = 54.1 →54 units

where Gu(k) = 0.2270 from Appendix II. Note that holding and ordering costs are not
equal, unlike in Chapter 4. We can see from Figure 6.10 the form of the total cost as a
function of k. With B2 = 0.25, the decrease in total cost is small as k is increased from 0 to
its optimal value (k ≈0.41). Costs can increase sharply if k is set far too high. Now with
B2 = 1.0 shortages are much more expensive, and it is beneﬁcial to hold more SS. The result

is that the decrease in cost as k increases from 0 is much more pronounced. With B2 = 1.0,
the optimal k is approximately 1.37.
6.7.6.2 Discussion
As seen in Equation 6.22, the safety factor k increases as B2/r increases, as one would expect.
Moreover, under the use of EOQs, we found that Q/D decreases as Dv increases. Therefore, at
least under the use of EOQs, we can see from Equation 6.22 that k increases as Dv increases; that
is, under this decision rule, larger safety factors are given to the faster-moving items, all other things
being equal.
The pu≥(k) value represents a probability; hence, there is no solution to Equation 6.22 when
the right-hand side of the equation exceeds unity; that is, when Equation 6.21 is satisﬁed. It can be
shown (in a manner paralleling the derivation in Section 6A.1 of the Appendix of this chapter) that,
when this happens, the lowest permissible value of the safety factor should be used. Intuitively, the
condition is satisﬁed if the shortage cost rate B2 is smaller than the holding cost rate, r (for Q = D,
to be precise). If r = B2, the condition is satisﬁed if the order quantity is larger than the annual
demand.

6.7.9 Decision Rule for a Specified Probability (P1) of No Stockout

Suppose management has speciﬁed that the probability of no stockout in a cycle should be no lower
than P1 (conversely, the probability of a stockout should be no higher than 1−P1). Then, we have
the following simple decision rule (whose derivation is shown in Section 6A.2 of the Appendix of
this chapter).
Step 1 Select the safety factor k to satisfy
pu≥(k) = 1 −P1

where
pu≥(k) = Pr{Unit normal variable (mean 0, standard deviation 1) takes on a value of k or

Step 2 Safety stock, SS = kσL.
Step 3 Reorder point, s = ˆxL + SS, increased to the next higher integer (if not already exactly an
integer).
6.7.9.1 Numerical Illustration
Suppose that the forecast system generates the following values:
ˆxL = 58.3 units
σL = 13.1 units
Management also desires a service level of P1 = 0.90. From Equation 6.26, we know that
pu≥(k) = 0.10
From Table II.1 in Appendix II (or from the function NORMSINV(1 −pu≥(k)) on Excel)
k ≈1.28
SS = kσL = 1.28 × 13.1 units
= 16.8 units
Reorder point, s = 58.3 + 16.8 = 75.1, say 76 units.
6.7.9.2 Discussion of the Decision Rule
From Equation 6.26, we can see that the safety factor k depends only on the value of P1; in
particular, it is independent of any individual-item characteristics such as the order quantity Q.
Therefore, all items for which we desire the same service level, P1, will have identical values of the
safety factor k. Thus, we see an equivalence between two criteria, namely, using a speciﬁed value
of k and a speciﬁed value of P1.
Because of the discrete nature of the reorder point, we are not likely to be able to provide the
exact level of service desired since this usually would require a noninteger value of s. Therefore,
a noninteger value of s found in Equation 6.26 is rounded up to the next higher integer, with
the predicted service level then being slightly higher than required. Such diﬀerences are often less
pronounced than the error in the input data.
The fact that the safety factor does not depend on any individual-item characteristics may
necessitate reexamining the meaning of service here. Recall that service under the measure used
in this section is prob no stockout per replenishment cycle. Consider two items, the ﬁrst being
replenished 20 times a year, the other once a year. If both of them are given the same safety factor
so that both have a probability of 0.10 of stockout per replenishment cycle, then, we would expect
20 × (0.10) or 2 stockouts per year for the ﬁrst item and only 1 stockout every 10 years (0.1 per
year) for the second item. Therefore, depending on management’s deﬁnition of service, we, in fact,

may not be giving the same service on these two items. Rules based on other service measures will
now be presented.
6.7.10 Decision Rule for a Specified Fraction (P2) of Demand Satisfied

The following decision rule is derived in Section 6A.2 of the Appendix to this chapter.
Step 1 Select the safety factor k that satisﬁes*
Gu(k) = Q
σL
(1 −P2)
(6.28)
where Q has been predetermined, presumably by one of the procedures of Chapter 4 (and
must be expressed in the same units as σL). The other relevant variables are deﬁned in
Section 6.7.1.
Make sure that the k value is at least as large as the lowest allowable value of the safety
factor.
Step 2 Reorder point, s = ˆxL + kσL, increased to the next higher integer (if not already exactly
an integer).
A brief comment on the order quantity is in order. It is common practice to use the EOQ for
the order quantity in an (s, Q) system. Although this practice is often very close to the optimal,
Platt et al. (1997) have shown that a simple modiﬁcation of the order quantity outperforms the
EOQ when sequentially choosing the order quantity and reorder point. They recommend an order
quantity based on the limit as the ratio EOQ/σ →∞, when using a ﬁll rate as the performance
measure:
Q = 1
P2

2AD
rv
+ σ2
L
Equation 6.28 underestimates the true ﬁll rate if σL is large relative to Q, because Equation 6.28
double counts backorders from a previous cycle that are not met at the start of the next cycle.
A more accurate formula for small values of Q/σL is
Gu(k) −Gu(k + Q/σL) = Q
σL
(1 −P2)
(6.29)
For further discussion of the ﬁll rate, see Silver (1970), Johnson et al. (1995), Zipkin (1986), Platt
et al. (1997), and Disney et al. (2015).
* Equation 6.28 applies for the case of complete backordering. The only diﬀerence for the case of complete lost
sales is that 1 −P2 is replaced by (1 −P2)/P2:

6.7.10.1 Numerical Illustration
Consider a particular type of developing liquid distributed by a manufacturer of laboratory sup-
plies and equipment. Management has speciﬁed that 99% of demand is to be satisﬁed without
backordering. A replenishment quantity of 200 gallons has been predetermined and the forecast
system provides us with ˆxL = 50 gallons and σL = 11.4 gallons.
Step 1 Equation 6.28 yields
Gu(k) = 200
11.4(1 −0.99) = 0.175
and Table II.1 in Appendix II gives
k = 0.58
Step 2
s = 50 + 0.58(11.4) = 56.6 →57 gallons
In this case, Equation 6.29 gives the same result as Equation 6.28. For the case of com-
plete lost sales (rather than backordering), the use of Equation 6.27 would lead us to the
same value of the reorder point. Recall that Gu(k) can be obtained using a rational approx-
imation presented in Appendix III at the end of the book. This is especially appropriate for
spreadsheet use, and is extremely accurate.
6.7.10.2 Discussion
Intuitively, we would expect that the required SS would increase if (1) Q decreased (more opportu-
nities for stockouts), (2) σL increased (higher uncertainty of forecasts), or (3) P2 increased (better
service desired). If any of these changes take place, Gu(k) decreases, but as seen from the table
in Appendix II, a decrease in Gu(k) implies an increase in k, that is, exactly the desired behavior.
These relationships can be seen in Figure 6.11.
In addition, on average, σL tends to increase with D; therefore, the increase in k with increas-
ing σL says that, on the average under this decision rule, faster-moving items get higher safety
factors than do the slower-moving items.
If the right-hand side of Equation 6.28 is large enough, a negative value of k is required to
produce the equality; to give a service level as poor as P2, one must deliberately plan to be short on
the average when a replenishment arrives. In particular, if Q is large, many customers have their
demand satisﬁed before there is even an opportunity for a stockout. When a replenishment order is
placed, so many demands have been met from the shelf that a stockout will only serve to lower P2
to the target. Management may ﬁnd this intolerable and, instead, set a lower limit on k (e.g., zero).
If k is set at zero when Equation 6.28 calls for a negative value of k, the service provided will be
better than P2.
The P2 value is usually quite close to unity. Therefore, as evidenced by the numerical example,
Equations 6.27 and 6.28 normally give very similar values of Gu(k), that is, of k itself. In other
words, the value of the safety factor is little inﬂuenced by whether the model assumes complete
backordering or complete lost sales (or any mix of these two extremes).
Finally, a comparison of Equations 6.23 and 6.28 shows the analogy between the P2 and B3
measures mentioned earlier.

From Table II.1 of Appendix II, we have

and,
s = 58.3 + 18.9 = 77.2, say 78 units
6.7.11.2 Discussion
A comparison of Equations 6.22 and 6.31 reveals that there is an equivalence between using the
B2 costing method and using the TBS service measure. Speciﬁcally, we have, for equivalence, that
TBS = B2
r
From Equation 6.31, we see that increasing TBS leads to a lower value of pu≥(k), and hence a
larger value of the safety factor k, which is certainly an appealing behavior.
6.7.12 Decision Rule for the Allocation of a TSS to Minimize
the ETSOPY
As shown in Section 6A.4 of the Appendix of this chapter, allocation of a total safety stock (TSS)
among a group of items to minimize the ETSOPY leads to a decision rule identical to that under
the B1 shortage-costing method. Thus, simply use the procedure of Section 6.7.5, adjusting the
value of B1 until the total implied SS is equal to the given quantity to be allocated. (Conversely,
when we discuss SS exchange curves later in this chapter, we will see that the selection of an
aggregate operating point on an appropriate exchange curve will imply a value of B1 to be used).
The total number of stockout occasions per year is simply the product of the probability of a
stockout in a replenishment cycle multiplied by the number of cycles per year:

per year (ETVSPY)

Thus, for the allocation criterion, one needs to only use the procedure of Section 6.7.6, adjust-
ing the value of B2 until the total implied SS is equal to the given quantity to be allocated. The
total value of shortages per year is the product of the number of shortages per replenishment cycle,
multiplied by the value of those shortages, multiplied by the number of cycles per year:

6.7.14 Nonnormal Lead Time Demand Distributions
As mentioned earlier, for pragmatic reasons, we have focused on the case of normally distributed
demands (or forecast errors) in this chapter. The normal distribution often provides a good empir-
ical ﬁt to the observed data: it is convenient from an analytic standpoint, it is widely tabulated and
is now built into spreadsheets, and, ﬁnally, the impact of using other distributions is usually quite
small (see, e.g., Naddor 1978; Fortuin 1980; Lau and Zaki 1982; Tyworth and O’Neill 1997),
particularly when recognizing the other inaccuracies present (estimates of the parameters of the
distribution, estimates of cost factors, and so on). Tyworth and O’Neill (1997) and Lau and Zaki
(1982) show that, while the errors in SS may be high when using the normal, the errors in total
cost are quite low. If the ratio σL/ˆxL is greater than 0.5, it may be desirable to use another dis-
tribution for lead time demand, such as the Gamma. (When this ratio equals 0.5, the probability
of negative values of demand for a normal distribution is 2.3%; but the real issue in choosing
the reorder point is the right tail of the distribution.) Therefore, we often use the following rule
of thumb: If the ratio σL/ˆxL is greater than 0.5, consider a distribution other than the normal.
However, so long as this ratio is less than 0.5, the normal is probably an adequate approximation.
Finally, if daily demand is not normal, the normal will generally be a good approximation for lead
time demand if the lead time is at least several days in duration. (If the lead time itself follows some
probability distribution, consult Section 6.10.) As discussed in Chapter 3, it is advisable to at least
test the normal distribution using data from a sample of items.
We now comment speciﬁcally on three other distributions—namely, the Gamma, the Laplace,
and the Poisson. As discussed by Burgin (1975), the Gamma distribution has considerable intu-
itive appeal for representing the distribution of lead time demand. In particular, if the demand
distribution is skewed to the right, or if the ratio σL/ˆxL is greater than 0.5, use of the Gamma
should be considered. The distribution is not as tractable as the normal; thus, considerable eﬀort
has been devoted to developing approximations and tables (see Burgin and Norman 1976; Das
1976; Taylor and Oke 1976, 1979; Johnston 1980; Van der Veen 1981; Tyworth et al. 1996). We
derive an expression for expected units short per cycle in the Appendix to this chapter, and we
present a simple spreadsheet approach for ﬁnding reorder points using the Gamma distribution in
Appendix III.
The Laplace or pseudoexponential distribution was ﬁrst proposed by Presutti and Trepp (1970).
It is analytically very simple to use and may be an appropriate choice for slow-moving items (see
Ng and Lam 1998).
The Poisson distribution is also a candidate for slower-moving items. In fact, in Chapter 7,
we will illustrate its use for expensive, low-usage items. Many other distributions of lead time

276
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
demand have been proposed in the literature. We now simply provide a listing of several of them
accompanied by suitable references:
1. Exponential: Brown (1977)
2. Geometric: Carlson (1982)
3. Logistic: Fortuin (1980), Van Beek (1978)
4. Negative binomial: Ehrhardt (1979), Agrawal and Smith (1996)
5. Pearson: Kottas and Lau (1980)
6. Tukey’s Lambda: Silver (1977)
7. Split-normal (for asymmetric lead time demand): Lefrancois (1989)
In addition, there has been a signiﬁcant amount of research on approaches that can model
a number of distributions. Zipkin (1988) describes the use of phase-type distributions that
can approximate many other distributions. Strijbosch and Heuts (1992) provide nonparametric
approximations. See also Sahin and Sinha (1987), Shore (1995), and Kumaran and Achary (1996).
A powerful method of ﬁtting many distributions using mixtures of Erlang distributions is presented
by Tijms (1986). Much work has been done on distribution-free approaches. The original work by
Scarf (1958) proposed ﬁnding the worst-possible distribution for each decision variable and then
ﬁnding the optimal inventory policy for that distribution. Thus, it is a conservative approach. It
requires only that the mean and variance of the lead time demand are known. Bulinskaya (1990),
Gallego (1992), Gallego and Moon (1993), and Moon and Choi (1994, 1995) have advanced the
research, and have shown that, in some cases, applying a distributional form incorrectly can lead to
large errors. The distribution-free approach could generate signiﬁcant savings. If the distribution
appears to be very diﬀerent from a known form, one should consider the distribution-free formu-
las, or those described in the next paragraph. Silver and Rahnama (1986) ﬁnd the cost penalty for
using the mean and standard deviation from a statistical sample rather than the true values. Sil-
ver and Rahnama (1987) show that the safety factor, k, should be biased upward when using a
statistical sample.
Finally, we brieﬂy present a procedure that appears to be quite useful for a number of diﬀerent
distributions. Lau and Lau (1993) observe that the optimal order quantities in (s, Q) systems are
very similar regardless of the distribution of demand. Likewise, the cumulative distribution func-
tion of the lead time demand distributions evaluated at the reorder point s, or Fx(s) = s
0 fx(x0)dx0,
is quite close. Building on these insights, they develop a simple approach for the case of B2 short-
age costing, relatively few stockout occasions, and Q > s. They employ the uniform distribution,
which is easy to evaluate, for use in ﬁnding the order quantity. Then, they use the actual lead time
demand distribution for ﬁnding the reorder point.
Let g2 = 2DB2/r and ﬁnd
Q =

EOQ2(g2)
g2(g2 −4σL
√3)
and
Fx(s) = 1 −2

EOQ2
g2(g2 −4σL
√3)
Finally, use the actual lead time demand distribution to ﬁnd s from Fx(s). See Problem 6.26
for an example. Lau and Lau demonstrate that the cost error of using this approach rather than the
exact approach is nearly always less than 1%. See also Shore (1995) for a similar approach.

6.8 Implied Costs and Performance Measures
When choosing a cost minimization or a service objective approach, it is important to realize that
the obtained inventory policy necessarily implies values for alternate cost or service measures. These
should be reported to the management if there is a possibility that the alternate measures are of
interest. An example will be helpful.
Assume that the ﬁll rate, P2 = 0.98, is chosen as the service objective, and that the item in
question has the following characteristics:
D = 4000 units/year
A = $20.25
r = 0.30 $/$/year
v = $6/unit
L = 1 week
ˆxL = 80 units
σL = 20 units
We can calculate the EOQ to be 300 units, and using Equation 6.28 we ﬁnd that Gu(k) =
0.30. Therefore, k = 0.22 and s = 84.4, or rounded to s = 85. Now, it is possible that managers
are also interested in the probability of a stockout in a replenishment cycle. For this (s, Q) policy
of (85, 300), we know that k = (85 −80)/20 = 0.25. Note that the actual k is greater than 0.22
because we rounded s up to 85. Thus, pu≥(k) = 0.4013 (from Table II.1 in the Appendix II).
So P1 = 1 −0.4013 = 0.5987. In other words, a ﬁll rate of 98% yields a cycle service level of
only 59.87%. In this case, the relatively large order quantity implies that many customers have their
demands met from the shelf before a lead time ever begins. Thus, frequent stockouts at the end of
the replenishment cycle do not signiﬁcantly lower the ﬁll rate. They do, on the other hand, imply
a relatively low cycle service level. See Snyder (1980). This may be acceptable to management; but
it may also be problematic, and the inventory policy should be adjusted.
A similar approach can be used to determine the implied values for costs, such as B2. In the pre-
ceding example, the fact that pu≥(k) = 0.4013 implies, using Equation 6.22, that B2 = 0.056—or
the cost of a unit short is 5.6% of the unit value. Again, this value may be consistent with manage-
ment’s perspective, or it may seem to be completely in error. If the latter is true, it would be wise
to consider other inventory policies that are more consistent.
In general, we can see that for any input performance objective (B1, B2, P1, and so on), we will
obtain a value for k, which will be used to ﬁnd the reorder point, s. The value of k can then be used
to ﬁnd the implied values of any of the other input performance objectives.
6.9 Decision Rules for Periodic-Review, Order-Up-to-Level
(R, S) Control Systems
Recall that in an (R, S) system every R units of time, a replenishment order is placed of suﬃ-
cient magnitude to raise the inventory position to the order-up-to-level S. Fortunately, for such
systems, there will be no need to repeat all the detail that was necessary for (s, Q) systems in the
previous section, because there is a rather remarkable, simple analogy between (R, S) and (s, Q)
systems. Speciﬁcally, the (R, S) situation is exactly equivalent to the (s, Q) situation if one makes
the following transformations:

It therefore follows that the decision rule for determining the S value in an (R, S) system for a
particular selection of shortage cost or service measure is obtained from the corresponding rule for
determining s in an (s, Q) system by simply making the above three substitutions. Prior to proving
this equivalence, we will discuss the choice of R as well as the key time period involved in the
selection of S.
6.9.1 The Review Interval (R)
In an (R, S) control system, a replenishment order is placed every R units of time; and when
computing the value of S, we assume that a value of R has been predetermined. The determination
of R is equivalent to the determination of an EOQ expressed as a time supply, except for two minor
variations. First, the cost of reviewing the inventory status must be included as part of the ﬁxed
setup cost A. Second, it is clear that it would be senseless to attempt to implement certain review
intervals, for example, 2.36 days; that is, R is obviously restricted to a reasonably small number
of feasible discrete values. In fact, as mentioned in Section 6.3, the value of R is often dictated by
external factors, such as the frequency of truck deliveries.
6.9.2 The Order-Up-to-Level (S)
The key time period over which protection is required is now of duration R + L, instead of just
a replenishment lead time L. This is illustrated in Figure 6.12 and Table 6.7 with an example
where S = 50 units and where two consecutive orders (called X and Y ) are placed at times t0 and
t0 + R, respectively, and arrive at t0 + L and t0 + R + L, respectively. In selecting the order-up-
to-level at time t0 we must recognize that, once order X has been placed, no other later orders (in
particular Y ) can be received until time t0 + R + L. Therefore, the order-up-to level at time t0
must be suﬃcient to cover demand through a period of duration R + L. A stockout could occur in
the early portion of the period (prior to t0 + L) but that would be a consequence of the setting of
the order-up-to-level on the order preceding order X. What is of interest to us is that a stockout
will occur toward the end of the period (after time t0 + L) if the total demand in an interval of
length R + L exceeds the order-up-to-level S. Another way of putting this is that any stockouts up
to time t0 + L will not be inﬂuenced by our ordering decision at time t0; however, this decision
certainly inﬂuences the likelihood of a stockout at time t0 + R + L. Of course, this does not mean
that we would necessarily take no action if at time t0 a stockout appeared likely by time t0 + L.
Probably, one would expedite any already-outstanding order or try to get the current order (that
placed at time t0) delivered as quickly as possible. Note, however, that this still does not inﬂuence
the size of the current order.
We should note that is often the case, in our experience, that an impending stockout generates
an overreaction on the part of the person responsible for purchasing. The current order size is
inﬂated, causing excess inventory when the order arrives. If the impending stockout is due to a real

increase in demand, the value of S should be recomputed. Otherwise, the manager should resist
the temptation to inﬂate inventories.
As mentioned above, a stockout will occur at the end of the current cycle (i.e., at time t0+R+L)
if the total demand in an interval of duration R + L exceeds S. A little reﬂection shows a very close
analogy with the determination of s in the continuous-review system. In fact, the only diﬀerence is
the duration of the time period of concern, namely, R + L instead of just L.
6.9.3 Common Assumptions and Notation
The assumptions are very similar to those listed in Section 6.7.1, with suitable replacements of
R + L for L, DR for Q, and S for s. We note only two additional assumptions:
1. There is a negligible chance of no demand between reviews; consequently, a replenishment
order is placed at every review.
2. The value of R is assumed to be predetermined. In most situations, the eﬀects of the two
decision variables, R and S, are not independent, that is, the best value of R depends on
the S value, and vice versa. However, as will be shown in Chapter 7, it is quite reasonable
for practical purposes when dealing with B items to assume that R has been predetermined
without knowledge of the S value.
Unlike in the (s, Q) situation, the assumption of unit-sized demand transactions is not needed
here.
We mention only notation that has not been used extensively thus far in this chapter:
R = prespeciﬁed review interval, expressed in years
S = order-up-to-level, in units
ˆxR+L = forecast (or expected) demand over a review interval plus a replenishment lead time, in
units
σR+L = standard deviation of errors of forecasts over a review interval plus a replenishment lead
time, in units
6.9.4 Common Derivation
We abbreviate this section because it closely parallels the development of (s, Q) systems. Because
of Assumption 1, we have
(Number of reviews per year) = 1/R
and
(Number of replenishment orders placed per year) = 1/R
(6.32)
We now present the relevant equations for SS and stockouts. (Reference to Figure 6.12 will
be helpful.) Recall that two orders, X and Y , are considered. If the demand (x) in R + L has a
probability density function fx(x0) deﬁned such that fx(x0)dx0 = Pr {Total demand in R + L lies

results:

On the average, the on-hand level is
E(OH) ≈S −ˆxR+L + DR/2
(6.36)
It is convenient to again set
SS = kσR+L
(6.37)
If forecast errors are normally distributed, the results of Appendix II give that Equa-
tions 6.34 and 6.35 reduce to
Pr{Stockout in a replenishment cycle} = pu≥(k)
(6.38)
and
ESPRC = σR+LGu(k)

The comparison reveals the validity of our earlier assertion that the (R, S) situation is exactly
equivalent to the (s, Q) situation if one makes the transformations listed at the beginning of this
section.
6.10 Variability in the Replenishment Lead Time Itself
In all the decision systems discussed in this chapter, the key variable in setting a reorder point or
order-up-to-level is the total demand in an interval of length R +L (which reduces to just L for the
case of continuous review). So far, our decisions have been based on a known replenishment lead
time L with the only uncertain quantity being the demand rate during L or R + L. If L itself is not
known with certainty, it is apparent that increased SS is required to protect against this additional
uncertainty.*
It should be noted that where the pattern of variability is known, for example, seasonally vary-
ing lead times, there is no additional problem because the lead time at any given calendar time is
known and the SS (and reorder point) can be adjusted accordingly. Where lead times are increas-
ing in a known fashion, such as in conditions of reduced availability of raw materials, again, SSs
(and reorder points) should be appropriately adjusted. We discuss these issues in more detail in
Chapter 7.
Every reasonable eﬀort should be made to eliminate variability in the lead time, and one can use
the models developed in this section to quantify the value of reduction in lead time variability. A
key component of the lead time in which uncertainty exists is the shipping time from the supplier
to the stocking point under consideration. Choices among transportation modes can aﬀect the
variability, as well as the average duration, of the lead time (see Herron 1983, and Problem 6.10).
Ordering process and information technology improvements can also reduce the average lead time
and lead time variability. Blackburn (2012) and De Treville et al. (2014) provide recent discussions
of the potential value of reductions in lead time and lead time variability.
* When inventory OH just after the arrival of a replenishment order may not be positive, de Kok (1990) has shown
that the transformation of Equation 6.29 is not straightforward. In fact, the more accurate equation for P2 is
P2 = 1 −

Lead time improvements, of course, require close cooperation with suppliers. In return for
ﬁrm commitments well ahead of time, a reasonable supplier should be prepared to promise a
more dependable lead time. The projection of ﬁrm commitments well into the future is not
an easy task. We return to this point in Chapter 15 in the context of Material Requirements
Planning, which oﬀers a natural means of making such projections. Firms also have been increas-
ingly employing strategic alliances—long-term relationships with close partners—to facilitate the
required cooperation.
Where there is still some residual variability in the lead time that cannot be eliminated, two
basic courses of action are possible:
1. Measure the distribution of the lead time (or R + L), and the distribution of demand per
period, separately. Then combine the two to obtain the distribution of total demand over the
lead time.
2. Try to ascertain the distribution of total demand over the full lead time by measuring or
estimating actual demand over that period.
In each case, there are at least two ways to use the information. First, assume (or ﬁt) a speciﬁc
functional form—such as the Normal—to the distribution of total demand over lead time. Or,
second, use the exact distribution to set an inventory policy.
6.10.1 Approach 1: Use of the Total Demand over the Full Lead Time
We begin by discussing a simple, but eﬀective, method that is useful when it is possible to measure
the total demand over the lead time. This procedure, due to Lordahl and Bookbinder (1994), uses
these measurements directly and is based on the distribution-free properties of order statistics. The
objective is to ﬁnd the reorder point, s, when the parameters, and form, of the lead time demand
distribution are unknown and P1 is the desired performance measure. The procedure requires only
that the user records, over time, the actual demand during lead time. These steps describe the
procedure:
1. Rank order the observed lead time demand from the least to the greatest. So x(1) ≤x(2) ≤
· · · ≤x(n) if there are n observations of lead time demand.
2. Let (n + 1)P1 = y + w, where 0 ≤w < 1, and y is an integer.
3. If (n + 1)P1 > n, set s = x(n). Otherwise, set s = (1 −w)x(y) + wx(y+1), a weighted average
of two of the observations. In eﬀect, the reorder point is estimated from two of the larger
values in the sample.
6.10.1.1 Numerical Illustration
A new entrepreneurial ﬁrm is trying to set reorder points for several items that are important to its
business. Because lead times are roughly 2–3 weeks, and order sizes are not too large, the manager
has gathered a number of observations of lead time demand. These are 15, 18, 12, 22, 28, 25, 22,
23, 11, and 19. The manager has set P1 = 0.85.
Step 1 Rank order the data. 11, 12, 15, 18, 19, 22, 22, 23, 25, 28.
Step 2 n = 10
P1 = 0.85

284
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
(n + 1)P1 = (11)(0.85) = 9.35.
Thus y + w = 9.35.
So y = 9 and w = 0.35.
Step 3 (n + 1)P1 < n, so
s = (1 −w)x(y) + wx(y+1)
x(y) = the 9th observation = 25
x(y+1) = the 10th observation = 28
s = (1 −0.35)25 + 0.35(28) = 26.05 or 26.
Lordahl and Bookbinder (1994) show that this procedure is better than using the normal distri-
bution in many cases. In particular, if the ﬁrm must achieve the targeted service level, this approach
works well.
Karmarkar (1994) provides a similar methodology in which the general shape of the demand
distribution is ignored because it is irrelevant to the SS decision. Rather, attention is focused on
the right tail of the distribution. His method uses a mixture of two distributions, with the right tail
modeled by a translated exponential. The method works quite well in simulation experiments.
The second way to apply Approach 1 is to measure the mean and variance of the total demand
over the lead time, and apply a speciﬁc functional form. Then, if the total demand appears to ﬁt
a normal distribution, the methods from this chapter can be used to ﬁnd the appropriate reorder
point.
6.10.2 Approach 2: Use of the Distribution of Demand Rate per Unit
Time Combined with the Lead Time Distribution
The second approach assumes that the lead time (L) and the demand (D) in each unit time period
are independent random variables, and requires measurements or estimates of each. The assump-
tion of independence is probably a reasonable approximation to reality despite the fact that, in
some cases, high demand is likely to be associated with long lead times (i.e., positive correlation),
because of the heavy workload placed on the supplier.* Likewise, low demand can be associated
with long lead times (i.e., negative correlation) because the supplier has to wait longer to accu-
mulate suﬃcient orders for his or her desired run size. If L and D are assumed to be independent
random variables, then
E(x) = E(L)E(D)
(6.41)
and
σx =

E(L)var(D) + [E(D)]2var(L)
(6.42)
where x, with mean E(x) and standard deviation σx, is the total demand in a replenishment lead
time, in units; L, with mean E(L) and variance var (L), is the length of a lead time (L is the number
of unit time periods, i.e., just a dimensionless number); and D with mean E(D) and variance
var (D) is the demand, in units, in a unit time period. Derivations for Equations 6.41 and 6.42 are
in Section 6A.5 of the Appendix.
Where variability in L exists, the E(x) and σx quantities found from Equations 6.41 and 6.42
should be used in place of ˆxL and σL in all the decision rules of this chapter.
* Wang et al. (2010) analyze the case where demand per period and lead times are correlated.

6.10.2.1 Numerical Illustration
We ﬁrst illustrate the use of this approach when the combined distribution is (or is assumed to be)
normally distributed. Let us consider two situations:
Situation 1: No Uncertainty in the Lead Time Itself (i.e., var (L) = 0 in Equation 6.42)
Suppose the unit time period is 1 week with E(L) = 4 and E(D) = 100 units and var(D) =
300 (units)2. Then Equations 6.41 and 6.42 give
E(x) = 400 units
and
σx = 34.64 units
Then, to provide a desired probability (P1) of no stockout per replenishment cycle equal to
0.95, we require a reorder point of s = E(x)+kσx = 400+1.64(34.64) = 456.81, say, 457 units.
Situation 2: Uncertainty in the Lead Time
Suppose that E(L), E(D), and var(D) are as above, so that E(x), the expected total demand over a
lead time, is still 400 units. However, now we assume that L itself is random, in particular
var(L) = 1.44
(The standard deviation of L is √var(L), or 1.2.) Then, Equation 6.42 gives
σx =

(4)(300) + (100)2(1.44) = 124.90 units
Now we ﬁnd that the reorder point must be 605 units. In other words, the uncertainty in L
has increased the reorder point by 148 units. Knowing the values for v and r would permit us
to calculate the additional carrying costs implied by the extra 148 units. These extra costs would
provide a bound on how much it would be worth to reduce or eliminate the variability in L.
6.10.3 Nonnormal Distributions
The expressions for mean and standard deviation of demand during lead time in Equations 6.41
and 6.42 do not necessarily assume a Normal distribution. So, these values could be used in con-
junction with another distribution, such as the Gamma distribution (e.g., Tyworth et al. 1996;
Moors and Strijibosch 2002; Leven and Segerstedt 2004). Such an approach may be justiﬁed when
the demand during lead time is positively skewed or the ratio of √var(L)/E(L) is large*. Use of
the Gamma distribution is a good alternative in these cases. In Appendix III, we present the details
of how one can implement the use of the Gamma distribution in a spreadsheet.
When combining the demand and lead time distribution using the approach in the previous
section, it is possible to draw on some compelling research. Eppen and Martin (1988) show by an
example that if the lead time takes on just a few values, say 2 or 4 weeks with equal probability, the
use of the normal distribution provides very poor and unusual results. In fact, the reorder point in
their example actually increases when the lead time decreases. (See Problem 6.27.)
* Note that if this ratio is much greater than 0.4, there is a signiﬁcant chance of negative demand values.

286
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
Other research on the problem of variable lead time includes Burgin (1972), McFadden (1972),
Magson (1979), Ray (1981), Mayer (1984), Bagchi and Hayya (1984), Bagchi et al. (1984, 1986),
Zipkin (1988), Bookbinder and Lordahl (1989), Tyworth (1992), Chen and Zheng (1992), Feder-
gruen and Zheng (1992), Wang and Rao (1992), Strijbosch and Heuts (1994), Heuts and de Klein
(1995), and Keaton (1995). Most of this research assumes that the lead time and demand distri-
butions are given (even if not known). Wu and Tsai (2001) and Chu et al. (2004) investigate the
more complicated but more ﬂexible approach of using mixtures of distributions for modeling lead
times.
It is often possible, however, to “change the givens,” and some work on this problem has been
done. Das (1975) shows that the total relevant costs are more sensitive to changes in the expected
lead time if √var(L)/E(L) > 1. Otherwise, they are more sensitive to changes in the variance of
lead time. This study has implications for where improvement resources should be allocated—to
reduce the average lead time, or to reduce the variability of lead time. See also Nasri et al. (1990),
Paknejad et al. (1992), Song (1994a,b), Lee et al. (2000), and Ray et al. (2004).
6.11 Exchange Curves Involving SSs for (s, Q) Systems
As was discussed in Chapters 1 and 2, management is primarily concerned with aggregate mea-
sures of eﬀectiveness. In Chapter 4, exchange curves were developed that showed the aggregate
consequences, in terms of the total average cycle stock versus the total number (or costs) of replen-
ishments per year, when a particular policy (the EOQ) is used across a population of items. The
curve was traced out by varying the value of the policy variable A/r. In a similar fashion, exchange
curves can be developed showing the aggregate consequences, in terms of TSS (in dollars) versus
aggregate service, when a particular decision rule for establishing SSs (i.e., reorder points) is used
across a population of items.
Exchange curves are also useful as a means of determining the preferred level of service for a
given investment in the inventory. Many inventory formulas assume that the ﬁrm has an inﬁnite
amount of working capital available. Obviously, this is never true. If the ﬁrm can achieve its service
objectives without being constrained by dollar investment in the inventory, it is in an enviable posi-
tion. Unfortunately, many ﬁrms face constraints on the amount of money available for investment
in inventories, and must trade oﬀinventory investment with service.
We begin, in Section 6.11.1, our discussion of exchange curves with an example of the inven-
tory/service trade-oﬀfor a single item. Then, we show, in Section 6.11.2, a simple three-item
example that illustrates the aggregate beneﬁts that are usually possible in moving away from the
commonly used approach of basing SSs (or reorder points) on equal time supplies. We also describe
the general method of developing exchange curves.
As in Chapter 4, there is an input policy variable for each type of decision rule. For example,
the management may decide to compute reorder points based on a common P2 objective—that
is, each item’s reorder point is determined using the formulas from Section 6.7.10. Management’s
selection of an aggregate operating point, based on the exchange curve developed, implies a value of
the policy variable—say, P2 = 0.97. The use of this implicit value in the corresponding individual-
item decision rule then leads to the desired aggregate consequences. An outline of the derivation of
exchange curves is presented in Section 6.11.3. We restrict attention to (s, Q) systems but, because
of the analogy developed in Section 6.9, the same type of approach can be used for (R, S) systems.
In each case, note that by developing the formulas on a spreadsheet, it is straightforward to use a
data table or similar functionality to quickly build exchange curves.

Management’s ability to meaningfully utilize the SS versus service exchange curve hinges on
their capacity to think of inventories as being split into the two components of cycle stocks and
SSs and to be able to make separate tradeoﬀs of cycle stocks versus replenishments and SSs versus
aggregate service. Based on our experience, these conditions are not always met. Therefore, in
Section 6.11.4, we discuss the so-called composite exchange curves that show a three-way exchange
of the total stock (cycle plus safety, in dollars) versus the number of replenishments per year versus
aggregate service.
6.11.1 Single Item Exchange Curve: Inventory versus Service
When a manager is faced with a constraint on the amount of money available to invest in the
inventory, it is necessary to determine the best customer service possible for the given investment.
Often, however, the constraint is not rigid—it is possible to divert funds from other activities if
it is determined that the gains in customer service are worth the loss in those other activities. An
exchange curve, even for a single item, is extremely valuable in such situations. Figure 6.13 presents
one example, using a ﬁll rate (P2) service objective and dollar investment in SS. Notice that the
relationship is not linear; in fact, there are diminishing returns. In other words, to attain perfect
customer service, the cost is exceedingly high. Also, notice that because of a relatively large order
quantity, the actual SS required for low service levels is very low. The authors have used curves like

Figure 6.13 to show clients how much money is required to achieve their desired level of customer
service. Alternatively, the manager can choose a service level based on the capital available.
It is critical, however, when using exchange curves in this way, to consider the possibility of
changing the givens. What would happen, for instance, if the lead time were reduced? Or, what
would be the eﬀect of a closer relationship to the customers so that demand variability were
reduced? Figure 6.13 illustrates the result of reducing demand variability by half for the partic-
ular item considered. The savings in SS are signiﬁcant, especially for high service levels, implying
that managers should consider investing resources to reduce demand variability.
6.11.2 An Illustration of the Impact of Moving away from Setting
Reorder Points as Equal Time Supplies
Single item exchange curves can be useful; but, by far, the more common use of exchange curves is
with multiple items. We now brieﬂy discuss the general approach to developing exchange curves,
an approach that is easy to use even with spreadsheets. As noted in Section 6.8, when an input
objective is speciﬁed for an item, implied measures of performance are obtained. To develop
exchange curves, one simply speciﬁes an input objective (such as B1, B2, P1, or P2). The computa-
tions required to ﬁnd the reorder point for each item involve ﬁnding a k value for each item. This
k value then determines the implied value of the other performance measures, such as B1, B2, P1,
or P2. Managers may also be interested in TSS, the expected total number of stockout occasions
per year (ETSOPY), or the expected total value of shortages per year (ETVSPY). See Table 6.8.
These can then be graphed on an exchange curve.
It is not uncommon for organizations to use the following type of rule for setting reorder points:
reorder when the inventory position has dropped to a 2-month time supply. Without going into
detail, we wish to show the impact of moving away from this type of decision rule. To illustrate, let
us consider three typical items produced and stocked by MIDAS International (a parent company,
serving Canadian as well as other subsidiaries and direct customers throughout the world). Relevant
characteristics of the items are given in Table 6.9. The order quantities, assumed as prespeciﬁed,
are as shown. The current reorder points are each based on a 2-month time supply (i.e., D/6).
Assuming normally distributed forecast errors, it can be shown (by the procedure to be dis-
cussed in Section 6.11.3) that, under the use of the current reorder points, the SSs, the expected

stockout occasions per year, and the expected values short per year are as listed in columns (2), (3),
and (4) of Table 6.10. If the TSS of $14,900 is instead allocated among the items to give equal
probabilities of stockout per replenishment cycle (i.e., equal P1 values), the resulting expected
stockout occasions per year and the expected values short per year are as in columns (6) and (7) of
the table. The reallocation has reduced both aggregate measures of disservice substantially without
increasing inventory investment. The reason for this is that the current equal-time supply strategy
does not take into account of the fact that the forecasts for PSP-002 and PSP-003 are considerably
more uncertain relative to their average demand during the lead time than PSP-001. Note the
shift of SS away from PSP-001 to the other items under the revised strategy. The marked service
improvement for PSP-002 and PSP-003 outweighs the reduction in service of PSP-001 caused by
this reallocation of SS. The type of service improvement indicated here is typical of what can be
achieved in most actual applications of logical decision rules for computing reorder points.
For either of the two service objectives shown in Table 6.10, we can achieve even greater
improvement by determining reorder points using a B1 or B2 rule. As discussed in Section 6.7.12,

a B1 rule will minimize the expected total stockouts per year for a given inventory budget. As indi-
cated in Section 6.7.13, a B2 will minimize ETVSPY for a given inventory budget. Keeping the
same order quantities as above (see Table 6.9), we can calculate the SS allocations that minimize
these service objectives for this numerical example. These allocations are shown in Table 6.11.
It is not a coincidence in Table 6.11 that the expected stockout occasions per year are the same
for all three items when using a B2 rule. Rearrangement of Equation 6.22 gives
ESOPY =
D
Q

pu≥(k) = r
B2
So, if items are subject to the same holding cost rate r and the same fractional charge per unit
short B2, the expected stockout occasions per year will be the same.
We can compare the performance of these diﬀerent approaches for setting reorder points across
a wide range and generate a multi-item exchange curve as shown in Figures 6.14 and 6.15. As we
would expect, allocating SS according to a B1 rule generates the best (lowest SS levels for a given
level of service) exchange curve when the performance measure is the expected stockout occasions
per year. In addition, this ﬁgure indicates how poorly a simplistic rule such as equal time supply can
perform. Figure 6.15 shows an analogous result where an allocation based on a B2 rule performs
best when we seek to minimize the expected total value short.
6.11.3 Derivation of the SS Exchange Curves
We now provide a more formal treatment of exchange curve derivation. In all cases, for a given
value of the relevant policy variable, the corresponding point on each exchange curve is found in
the following manner. First, the value of the safety factor ki is ascertained for each item by use of
the appropriate decision rule. Then, any number of output performance measures are computed

(6.47)
These equations are, of course, based on an assumption of normally distributed errors.
However, one could develop comparable results for any of the other distributions discussed in
Section 6.7.14.
Equation 6.44 follows from multiplying the expected number of replenishment cycles per year
(Equation 6.15) by the probability of a stockout per cycle (Equation 6.16). Similarly Equation 6.45
is a result of the product of the expected number of replenishment cycles per year (Equation 6.15)
and the expected shortage per replenishment cycle, expressed in dollars (vi times Equation 6.17).
Finally, each of the these quantities is summed across all items. In the last two cases, it is common
to take a demand-weighted summation:

The results of Equations 6.48 and 6.49 give a point on the ﬁrst exchange curve (e.g., Fig-
ure 6.14) and those of Equations 6.48 and 6.50 give a point on the second curve (e.g., Figure 6.15)

The approximation of Equation 6.45 is quite accurate as long as Qi/σLi > 1, because then the additional term

variable generates a set of points for each of the two curves. Similar curves can be generated for
demand-weighted ﬁll rate and demand-weighted cycle service level.
In some cases, it is not necessary to go through all the calculations of Equations 6.48
through 6.52. To illustrate, for the case of a speciﬁed fraction (P2) of demand to be satisﬁed directly

provided, of course, that no individual ki has to be adjusted up to a minimum allowable value (thus
providing a better level of service than P2 for that particular item).
6.11.4 Composite Exchange Curves
For any decision rule for selecting SSs, we can combine the EOQ exchange curve showing the total
average cycle stock versus the number of replenishments per year (recall Figure 4.12) with any of
the SS exchange curves (TSS vs. aggregate service level). The result is a set of composite exchange
curves showing a three-way trade-oﬀof the total average stock versus the number of replenishments
per year versus the aggregate service level. A separate line is required for each combination of deci-
sion rule and aggregate service measure. For the three-item numerical example from the previous
section, we have shown an illustrative set of curves (for three levels of only one aggregate service
measure) in Figure 6.16. They represent the use of the P2 decision rule and an EOQ ordering
strategy.

Figure 6.17
Breakdown of cycle stock and SS for an exchange curve with a P2 rule.
Each curve of Figure 6.16 decreases as the number of replenishments N increases for a given
aggregate service level (the value of P2). This is a consequence of the reduction in cycle stock that
results from more frequent replenishment dominating the increase in SS needed to maintain the
desired P2 level.
Figure 6.17 shows the behavior of cycle stock and SS separately for P2 = 0.98. It is clear in this
ﬁgure that more frequent replenishments reduce cycle stock and increase SS. It is quite possible
that in some settings, the increase in SS exceeds the reduction in cycle stock, and the aggregate
curves may eventually increase as the number of replenishments increases.
Selection of a desired aggregate operating point on a composite exchange curve implies:
1. A value of A/r to be used in the EOQ decision rule (this is not shown directly on the graphs;
instead, we show the total number of replenishments per year N. A/r can be found from N
using Equation 4.30 of Chapter 4).
2. A value of the parameter to be used in the particular SS decision rule under consideration
(e.g., P1, TBS, B1, etc.).
For extensions of these concepts see Gardner and Dannenbring (1979) and Gardner (1983).
6.12 Summary
In this chapter, we have introduced the reader to the fundamentals of inventory control under
probabilistic demand. For a variety of shortage costs and service measures, we have shown the
details of two common types of decisions systems:

Individual Items with Probabilistic Demand
■
295
1. (s, Q) systems
2. (R, S) systems
The material presented included the actual decision rules, illustrative examples, and a discussion
of each of the rules. Again, aggregate exchange curve concepts turned out to be an important aspect
of the analysis. In Chapter 7, we will address two other, somewhat more complicated control
systems—namely, (s, S) and (R, s, S)—in the context of A items.
It should now be apparent that, even for the case of a single item considered in isolation at a
single stocking point, it is not an easy task to cope with uncertainty. It is little wonder that usable
theory for more complex probabilistic situations (e.g., coordinated control of related items at a
single location, multi-echelon control of a single item, etc.) is not extensive. We will have more to
say on these issues in Chapters 10, 11, 15, and 16.
Problems
6.1
It is reasonable to assume that demand over its replenishment lead time of an item, ISF-086,
is normally distributed with ˆxL = 20 units and σL = 4.2 units.
a. For a desired service level of P1 = 0.90, compute the required safety factor, SS, and
reorder point.
b. Repeat for P1 = 0.94, 0.98, and 0.999.
c. Prepare a rough sketch of SS versus P1. Is the curve linear? Discuss.
6.2
The demand for a certain product has shown to be relatively stable; its sales are not subject
to any seasonal inﬂuence, and demand is not expected to change in the future. In fact,
during the last 10 lead times, the following demand was observed:
64
51
48
32
93
21
47
57
41
46
Assuming that this demand is a good representative of total demands in future lead
times and a reorder point of 51 is used, compute:
a. The various possible shortage sizes and their probabilities of occurrence (HINT: Assume
that these are the only values that the demand can take, each with a 0.1 probability of
occurring).
b. The expected (or average) shortage.
c. What reorder point would you use if the average shortage was to be no larger than
5 units? What is the associated probability of a stockout?
6.3
Consider an item with A = $25; Dv = $4,000/year; σLv = $100; B1 = $30; and r =
0.10 $/$/year.
a. Find the following:
i. EOQ, in dollars
ii. k, using the B1 criterion
iii. SS, in dollars
iv. Annual cost of carrying SS
v. Total average stock, in dollars
vi. Expected number of stockout occasions per year
vii. Expected stockout costs per year

Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
b. The cost equation used to develop the rule for the B1 criterion is
ETRC(k) = kσLvr + D
Q B1pu≥(k)
(6.53)
As seen in part 6.3a, the two components of Equation 6.53 are not equal at the
optimal k value. (This is in contrast to what we found for the EOQ analysis in Chap-
ter 4.) Why are the two components not equal? What quantities are equal at the optimal
k value?
c. By looking at the basic equations for the items requested in (a), discuss how each would
be aﬀected (i.e., whether it would be increased or decreased) by an increase in the
r value.
6.4
Consider an item with A = $25; D = 4, 000 units/year; v = $8/unit; L = 1 month;
σL = 100 units; TBS = 6 months; and r = 0.16 $/$/year.
a. Compute the reorder quantity of the (s, Q) policy using the EOQ.
b. Compute the safety factor, SS, and reorder point.
c. Graph TBS versus ETVSPY (the expected total value short per year).
6.5
Consider an item that has an average demand rate that does not change with time. Suppose
that demands in consecutive weeks can be considered as independent, normally distributed
variables. Observations of total demand in each of 15 weeks are as follows:

a. Estimate the mean and standard deviation of demand in a 1-week period and use these
values to establish the reorder point of a continuously reviewed item with L = 1 week.
A B2 value of 0.3 is to be used, and we have Q = 1,000 units, v = $10/unit, r =
0.24 $/$/year, and D = 5,200 units/year.
b. In actual fact, the above-listed demands were randomly generated from a normal distri-
bution with a mean of 100 units and a standard deviation of 30 units. With these true
values, what is the appropriate value of the reorder point? What is the percentage cost
penalty associated with using the result of part 6.5a instead?
6.6
Canadian Wheel Ltd. establishes SSs to provide a fraction of demand satisﬁed directly from
stock at a level of 0.94. For a basic item with an essentially level average demand, the annual
demand is 1,000 units and an order quantity of 200 units is used. The supplier of the item
ensures a constant lead time of 4 weeks to Canadian Wheel. The current purchase price
of the item from the supplier is $0.80/unit. Receiving and handling costs add $0.20/unit.
The supplier oﬀers to reduce the lead time to a new constant level of 1 week, but in doing
so, she will increase the selling price to Canadian by $0.05/unit. Canadian management is
faced with the decision of whether or not to accept the supplier’s oﬀer.
a. Qualitatively discuss the economic trade-oﬀin the decision. (Note: Canadian would
not increase the selling price of the item nor would they change the order quantity.)
b. Quantitatively assist management in the decision. (Assume that σt = σ1t1/2 and σ4 =
100 units where σ4 is the standard deviation of forecast errors over the current lead

time of 4 weeks. Also assume that forecast errors are normally distributed and that the
annual carrying charge is 20%.)
6.7
The 4N Company reacts to shortages at a particular branch warehouse in the following
fashion: Any shortage is eﬀectively eliminated by bringing material in from the plant by
air freight at a cost of $2.50/kg. Assume that the average demand rate of an item is essen-
tially constant with time and that forecast errors are normally distributed. Assume that an
(s, Q) system is to be used and that Q, if needed, is prespeciﬁed. To answer the following
questions, introduce whatever symbols are necessary:
a. What are the expected shortage costs per cycle?
b. What are the expected shortage costs per year?
c. What are the expected total relevant costs per year associated with the safety factor k?
d. Develop an equation that the best k must satisfy.
e. If we had two items with all characteristics identical except that item 1 weighed more
(on a unit basis) than item 2, how do you intuitively think that the two safety factors
would compare? Verify this using the result of part (d).
6.8
The Norwich Company has a policy, accepted by all its customers, of being allowed up to
1 week to satisfy each demand. Norwich wishes to use a P2 service measure with a speciﬁed
P2 value. Consider an item controlled by an (s, Q) system with Q prespeciﬁed. Suppose
that the lead time L was equal to the grace period.
a. Under these circumstances, what s value is needed to give P2 = 1.00?
b. More generally, consider an item with a desired P2 = 0.99 and a Q value of 500 units.
Other (possibly) relevant characteristics of the item are
D = 1,000 units/year (the average is relatively level throughout the year)
v = $5/unit
r = 0.20 $/$/year
L = 5 weeks
σ1 = 10 units (for a 1-week period); σt = σ1t1/2
How would you modify the logic for computing the s value to take into account of
the 1-week “grace” period? Illustrate with this item.
c. For the item of part (b), how would you estimate the annual cost savings of having the
grace period?
6.9
A retail electronic-supply outlet orders once every 2 weeks. For a particular item with unit
value (v) of $3, it is felt that there is a cost of $1 for each unit demanded when out of stock.
Other characteristics of the item are
L = 1 week
r = 30% per year
a. Consider a period of the year where ˆx1 = 30 units and MSE1 = 6 units (where
the unit time period is 1 week). What order-up-to-level S should be used? (Assume
σt = σ1t1/2.)
b. Suppose the average demand rate changed slowly throughout the year. Suggest a
reasonable way for the retailer to cope with this situation.

A particular company with production facilities located in Montreal has a large distribution
warehouse in Vancouver. Two types of transportation are under consideration for shipping
material from the plant to the remote warehouse, namely,
Option A: Send all material by railroad freight cars.
Option B: Send all material by air freight.

If only one of the two pure options can be used, outline an analysis that you would
suggest to help the management choose between the two options. Indicate the types of data
that you would require. Intuitively would it ever make sense to use both options, that is, to
use rail freight for part of the shipments and air freight for the rest? Brieﬂy explain why or
why not.

You have signed a consignment contract to supply a chemical compound to a major cus-
tomer. This compound costs you $32.50/gallon and generates a contribution of $12.50/gal-
lon. Delivery costs you $175 in shipping and handling. Demand for this year is estimated
at 2,000 gallons, standard deviation is 400 gallons. The contract says that the compound is
inventoried at your client’s facility: he will draw the material from that stock as needed and
pay you at such time. It also says that if the client ﬁnds that inventory empty when needed,
you are subject to a fee of $0.325/gallon/day short. Inventory carrying cost is 0.20 $/$/year.
a. Determine the optimal (s, Q) policy, assuming a stochastic lead time, L = 30 days,
standard deviation of lead time = 6.
b. Your customer has realized that controlling the stockout charge is too burdensome. Two
alternative charges have been proposed:
i. A ﬂat charge of $1,000 per stockout occasion.
ii. A $65 charge per gallon short per cycle.
Under each alternative, what would your policy be? Are the proposed changes accept-
able?

Consider an (r, S) policy where the management adopts a stockout charge B2 per unit short.
Is such a policy sensitive to the individual item’s parameters?
6.14
a. A company manager has decided that the inventory control policy “should have zero
stockouts.” Is this a realistic policy to pursue? In particular, discuss the implications in
terms of various types of costs.
b. On occasion, this company has ﬁlled an important customer order by supplying a com-
petitor’s product at below the retail price. What form of shortage costing would it be
appropriate to apply under such circumstances? Does this type of strategy make sense?

Safety Circuits Inc. stocks and sells small electronics products using an (R, S) type of con-
trol system. A manager reviews the stock monthly. The supplier delivers at their location

Safety Circuits Inc. is considering investing in a scanner such that they can move from
an (R, S) to an (s, Q) inventory policy (see Problem 6.15). It is expected that with a
continuous- review policy, the ﬁrm could reduce inventory management costs signiﬁcantly:
holding and shortage costs could be reduced. Management believes that for each unit short,
there is an implicit charge B2 = 0.15.
a. Determine the safety factor, SS, and reorder point for each of the three products,
assuming that the same lot sizes are adopted.
b. Determine the total relevant costs for the XRL product line under an (s, Q) policy and
B2 = 0.15.
c. Determine the total relevant costs for the XRL product line under an (R, S) policy and

d. Assume that the scanner costs $30,000, and its operating costs are immaterial. The

comprises 1% of the total average stock for the ﬁrm. Calculate the time before the
investment breaks even (disregard cost of money). Would you recommend the change?

True Colors Co. purchases a number of chemical additives for its line of colors and dyes.

ria for the B items. Consider the pigment Red-105: demand forecast for the next 12 months
of 200 gallons, with a standard deviation of 50 gallons. They cost $25/gallon at the sup-
plier’s plant, in addition to $30 per order for shipping and handling; expected lead time is

unpredictable losses at the supplier). Should the inventory policy be adjusted to account
for this lead time uncertainty? Discuss.

Consider a group of n items that are each being independently controlled using an (R, S)
type of system (periodic-review, order-up-to-level). Let Ri be the prespeciﬁed value (in
months) of R for item i. Suppose that we wish to allocate a total given SS in dollars (call
it W ) among the n items to minimize the dollars of expected backorders per unit time
summed across all n items.

forecast errors are normally distributed.

Botafogo Circuits imports some electronic components and redistributes them in the Brazil-
ian market. This includes some diﬃculties, such as delivery uncertainty. Using regular air
freight, shipping and handling costs $250 per item ordered, but the delivery may take any-
where from 10 to 30 days. Because of this uncertainty, the manager contacted a number of
carriers looking for more reliable alternatives. Two distinct bids stood up:
a. An express importer would deliver any order within 15 days, at a cost of $350 per item
ordered.

In its internal accounts, the manager considers a fractional charge of 0.50 for each unit

of stock is backordered. The EOQ is used to establish the Q value. A service level of 0.95
(demand satisﬁed without backorder) is desired. The item’s demand is somewhat diﬃcult

Consider the item discussed in Approach 2 in Section 6.10.2. Recall that with var(L) = 0,
the reorder point is 457 units if P1 is 0.95. Now suppose the ﬁrm actually reduces the
lead time by working with its supplier. Unfortunately, the reduced lead time is not always
achieved. In particular, the lead time is 2 weeks half of the time, but remains at 4 weeks half

the time. So
L = 4 with probability 0.5
and
L = 2 with probability 0.5
Thus, E(L) = 3, and var(L) = 0.5(2 −3)2 + 0.5(4 −3)2 = 1.
a. Use Equations 6.41 and 6.42 to ﬁnd the total lead time demand, and then ﬁnd the
reorder point assuming that the total demand is normally distributed.
b. Eppen and Martin (1988) provide an alternative solution that relies on the actual dis-
tributions. Let k1 be the safety factor when the lead time is 2 weeks; and let k2 be the
safety factor when the lead time is 4 weeks. Find an expression for the reorder point as
a function of k1 and another expression for the reorder point as a function of k2. Now
ﬁnd the optimal reorder point by noting that the weighted average service level is 95%.

Tower Bookstore orders books from one particular supplier every Tuesday. Once the order
is placed, it takes 3 days for delivery, and an additional four days to get the books on the
shelf. This season there is a book—The One Minute Parent—that is selling especially well.
The purchasing manager has gathered some data that she anticipates will be representative
of demand for the next several months. It turns out that weekly demand has been 75 books
on average, with a standard deviation of 5. The carrying charge is 18% per dollar invested
in books, and the manager has determined that the charge per unit short is 30% of the sales
price. Each copy costs Tower $5; and they apply a 50% markup to books of this type. Find
the correct ordering policy.

of 25. What is the expected quantity of backordered items per year if the manager uses an
optimal (s, Q) policy?:
a. The desired service level (the probability of no stockout during the lead time) is 90%.
b. The desired service level is 95%.
Appendix 6A: Some Illustrative Derivations and Approximations
6A.1 B1 Shortage Costing
We show two diﬀerent approaches: the ﬁrst using the total relevant costs; the second based on a
marginal analysis. The latter is simpler but does not permit sensitivity analysis (in that a total cost
expression is not developed).
6A.1.1 Total Cost Approach
We recall from Section 6.7.5 the expression for the expected total relevant costs per year as a
function of the control parameter k. Let us denote this function by ETRC (k). There are three

Individual Items with Probabilistic Demand
■
305
relevant components of costs: (1) replenishment (Cr), (2) carrying (Cc), and (3) stockout (Cs). So,
ETRC(k) = Cr + Cc + Cs
= AD/Q + (Q/2 + kσL)vr + DB1
Q pu≥(k)
We wish to select the k value that minimizes ETRC (k). A convenient approach is to set
dETCR(k)
dk
= 0
that is,
σLvr + DB1
Q
dpu≥(k)
dk
= 0
(6A.1)
But
dpu≥(k)
dk
= −fu(k)
(The derivative of the cumulative distribution function is the density function as shown in
Appendix II.) Therefore, Equation 6A.1 gives
fu(k) = QvσLr
DB1
(6A.2)
Now the density function of the unit normal is given by
fu(k) =
1
√
2π
exp(−k2/2)
Therefore, Equation 6A.2 gives
1
√
2π
exp(−k2/2) = QvσLr
DB1
(6A.3)
which solves for
k =

2 ln
DB1
√
2πQvσLr
(6A.4)
However, it is necessary to proceed with caution. Setting the ﬁrst derivative to zero does not
guarantee a minimum. In fact, Equation 6A.4 will have no solution if the expression inside the
square root is negative. This will occur if the argument of the logarithm is less than unity. A case
where this happens is shown in the lower part of Figure 6A.1. In such a situation, the model says
that the lower the k is, the lower the costs are. The model assumes a linear savings in carrying costs
with decreasing k. Obviously, this is not true indeﬁnitely. The practical resolution is to set k at its
lowest allowable value.

6A.1.2 Marginal Analysis
Let us consider the eﬀects of increasing s by a small amount, say s. The extra carrying costs per
year are given by
Marginal cost/year = svr
(6A.5)
Savings result when, in a lead time, the total demand lies exactly between s and s + s, so that
the extra s has avoided a stockout. On the average, there are D/Q replenishment occasions per
year. Thus,
Expected marginal savings/year = D
Q B1 Pr{Demand lies in interval s to s + s}
= D
Q B1fx(s)s
(6A.6)
Now consider a particular value of s. If the marginal cost associated with adding s to it
exceeds the expected marginal savings, we would not want to add the s. In fact, we might want
to go below the particular s value. On the other hand, if the expected marginal savings exceeded
the marginal cost, we would deﬁnitely want to increase s by s. However, we might wish to con-
tinue increasing s even higher. This line of argument leads us to wanting to operate at the s value,

Individual Items with Probabilistic Demand
■
307
where the marginal cost of adding s exactly equals the expected marginal savings. Thus, from
Equations 6A.5 and 6A.6, we wish to select s so that
svr = D
Q B1fx(s)s
or
fx(s) = Qvr
DB1
(6A.7)
This is a general result that holds for any probability distribution of lead time demand. For the
normal distribution, we have that
fx(s) =
1
√
2πσL
exp

−(s −ˆxL)2/2σ2
L

(6A.8)
Moreover, from Equations 6.7 and 6.8,
s = ˆxL + kσL
(6A.9)
Substitution of Equations 6A.8 and 6A.9 into Equation 6A.7 gives the same result as
Equation 6A.3.
6A.1.3 Behavior of k as a Function of Dv
Equation 6A.4 shows that k increases as D/QvσL or Dv/QvσLv increases. Now, empirically it has
been found that, on the average,
σLv ≈c1(Dv)c2
where c1 and c2 are constants that depend on the particular company involved but, in all known
cases, c2 lies between 0.5 and 1. Also assuming an EOQ form for Qv, we have
Qv = c3
√
Dv
Therefore, we have that k increases as
Dv
c3
√
Dvc1(Dv)c2
or
(Dv)1/2−c2
c1c3
increases. But, because c2 > 1
2, the exponent of Dv in the above quantity is negative. Therefore, k
goes down as Dv increases.
6A.2 P1 Service Measure
Suppose the reorder point is expressed as the sum of the forecast demand plus SS, as shown in
Equation 6.7. Furthermore, suppose, as in Equation 6.8, that the SS is expressed as the product of
two factors

308
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
1. The safety factor k—the control parameter
2. σL, the standard deviation of forecast errors over a lead time
Then from Equation 6.16, we have
Pr{stockout in a lead time} = pu≥(k)
(6A.10)
If the desired service level is P1, then we must have
Pr{stockout in a lead time} = 1 −P1
(6A.11)
It follows from Equations 6A.10 and 6A.11 that we must select k to satisfy
pu≥(k) = 1 −P1
which is Equation 6.26.
Had we not chosen the indirect route of using Equations 6.7 and 6.8, we would have ended up
with a more cumbersome result than Equation 6.26, namely,
pu≥[(s −ˆxL)/σL] = 1 −P1
6A.3 P2 Service Measure
6A.3.1 Complete Backordering
Because each replenishment is of size Q, we can argue as follows:
Fraction backordered = Expected shortage per replenishment cycle, ESPRC
Q
Fraction of demand satisﬁed directly from shelf = 1 −(Fraction backordered).
Therefore, we want
P2 = 1 −ESPRC
Q
(6A.12)
Substituting from Equation 6.17, we have
P2 = 1 −σLGu(k)
Q
which reduces to
Gu(k) = Q
σL
(1 −P2)
which is Equation 6.28.

Individual Items with Probabilistic Demand
■
309
6A.3.2 Complete Lost Sales
If demands when out of stock are lost instead of backordered, then, the expected demand per
cycle is no longer just Q, but rather is increased by the expected shortage per replenishment cycle,
ESPRC. Therefore, we now have
Fraction of demand satisﬁed directly from shelf = 1 −
ESPRC
Q + ESPRC
The derivation then carries through exactly as above, resulting in Equation 6.27.
6A.4 Allocation of a TSS to Minimize the ETSOPY

subject to

kiσLivi = Y
where n is the number of items in the population and Y is the TSS expressed in dollars. One
method of the solution is to use a Lagrange multiplier M (see Appendix I), that is, we select the
ki’s to minimize
L(ki’s, M) =
n

i=1

pu≥(ki) −M

This is accomplished by setting all the partial derivatives to zero. Now
∂L
∂ki
= −Di
Qi
fu(ki) + MσLivi = 0
or
fu(ki) = M QiviσLi
Di
But, this has the exact same form as Equation 6A.2 with M ≡r/B1. Therefore, selection of a
particular M value implies a value of B1. Also, of course, a given M value leads to a speciﬁc value
of Y .
The economic interpretation of the Lagrange multiplier M is that it represents the marginal
beneﬁt, in terms of reduced total expected stockouts, per unit increase in the total dollar budget
available for SSs. r is the cost to carry one dollar in SS for a year. B1 is the cost associated with a
stockout occasion. From a marginal viewpoint, we wish to operate where
(Cost to carry last dollar of safety stock) =
(expected beneﬁt of last dollar of safety stock)

310
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
that is,
r = (Reduction in total expected stockouts per year) × (Cost per stockout)
= MB1
thus, M = r/B1, as we found above.
6A.5 Standard Deviation of Demand during Lead Time
Demand in any period t is assumed to be a random variable Dt with mean E(D) and standard
deviation √var(D). In this analysis, demands in diﬀerent periods are assumed to be independent
and identically distributed and that the random variable for lead time L takes on only integer values.
As in Equations 6.41 and 6.42, x has mean E(x) and standard deviation σx, and lead time L has
mean E(L) and variance var(L).
Demand during the lead time x is a sum of random variables Dt where the number of terms in
the sum is also random (L).
x =
L

i=1
Di
We can ﬁnd both the mean and standard deviation of X by conditioning on the value of the lead
time L. First, for the mean,
E[x] = EL[ED[x|L]]
= EL[(L)E(D)]
= E(D)E(L)
Now, for the standard deviation, note that for any random variable Z, we can ﬁnd the variance
of Z by conditioning on another random variable (e.g., Ross 1983) say Y , as follows:
var[Z] = EY [varZ(Z|Y = y)] + varY [EZ(Z|Y = y)]
So, again conditioning on the value of the lead time L
σ2
x = EL[varD(x|L)] + varL[ED(x|L)]
= EL[(L)var(D)] + varL[E(D)(L)]
= (E(L))var(D) + [E(D)]2var(L)
σx =

E(L)var(D) + [E(D)]2var(L)
6A.6 Two Approaches to Determining Expected Costs
per Unit Time
Throughout the book, the basic approach we use in establishing the expected total relevant costs
per unit time will follow these steps:

Individual Items with Probabilistic Demand
■
311
1. Determine the average inventory level (¯I), in units.
2. Carrying costs per year = ¯Ivr .
3. Determine the average number of replenishments per year (N).
4. Replenishment costs per year = NA.
5. Determine the expected shortage costs per replenishment cycle, say W .
6. Expected shortage costs per year = NW .
7. Total expected costs per year = sum of the results of steps 2, 4, and 6.
If the inventory process has a natural regenerative point where the same state repeats periodi-
cally, then, a diﬀerent approach, using a key result of renewal theory, is possible. Each time that the
regenerative point is reached, a cycle of the process is said to begin. The time between consecutive
regenerative points is known as the length of the cycle, which we denote by Tc.
There is a set of costs (carrying, replenishment, and shortage) associated with each cycle. Let us
denote the total of these costs by Cc. This quantity is almost certainly a random variable because
its value depends on the demand process that is usually random in nature.
A fundamental result of renewal theory (see, e.g., Ross 1983), which holds under very general
conditions, is
Expected total relevant costs per unit time = E(Cc)
E(Tc)
The key point is that in a complicated process, it may be easier to evaluate each of E(Cc) and
E(Tc) instead of the left-hand side of this equation directly. See Silver (1976) for an illustration of
this approach.
6A.7 Expected Units Short per Cycle with the
Gamma Distribution
Suppose demand follows a Gamma distribution described by shape parameter α and scale param-
eter β, implying a mean of αβ and standard deviation of √αβ. Assuming a reorder point of s, we
write expected units short per replenishment cycle as
ESPRC =
∞
s
(x −s)f (x; α, β)dx
where f (x; α, β) represents the probability density function of the Gamma distribution with
parameters α and β
f (x; α, β) = xα−1e−x/β
βα(α)
 is the Gamma function that has the property x(x) = (x + 1).

312

Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
Note that
xf (x; α, β) = x xα−1e−x/β
βα(α)
= αβ
xαe−x/β
ββαα(α)
= αβ
xαe−x/β

ESPRC =

SPECIAL CLASSES OF
ITEMS
In Section II, we were concerned with routine control of B items, that is, the bulk of the items in
a typical population of stock-keeping units. Now, we turn our attention to special items, those at
the ends of the dollar-volume (Dv) spectrum, namely, the A and C groups as well as those items
not having a well-deﬁned continuing demand pattern. The most important items, the A group, are
handled in Chapter 7. Chapter 8 is concerned with slow-moving and low-dollar-volume items, the
C group. Then, in Chapter 9, we deal with style goods and perishable items, that is, SKUs that can
be maintained in inventory for only relatively short periods of time. The well-known newsvendor
problem is covered in this chapter. The presentation of this portion of the book continues in
the same vein as Section II; again, we are concerned primarily with managing individual-item
inventories, although we do discuss several cases of coordinating across multiple items.


Chapter 7
Managing the Most Important
Inventories
In this chapter, we devote our attention to the relatively small number of important items typically
classiﬁed in the A group. For such items, additional eﬀort may be warranted in both selecting
control parameters and managing inventory. While not all important items are necessarily high-
volume items, we restrict our attention in this chapter to items that are moderate to high volume.
Chapter 8 addresses the management of slow-moving items of all levels of importance. Section 7.1
presents a brief review of the nature of A items. This is followed, in Section 7.2, by some general
guidelines for the control of such items. Section 7.3 deals with faster-moving items and a more
elaborate set of decision rules, which, in an (s, Q) system, take account of the service (shortage)-
related eﬀects in selecting the value of the order quantity Q.* Next, in Sections 7.4 and 7.5, we
present control logic for two somewhat more complicated systems whose use may be justiﬁed for
A items. In Section 7.6, we address the issue of demand that is not stationary over time. Finally, in
Section 7.7, we brieﬂy discuss the research that analyzes the case of multiple suppliers.
7.1 Nature of Class A Items
Recall from Chapter 2 that class A items are deﬁned to be those at the upper end of the spectrum of
importance. That is, the total costs of replenishment, carrying stock, and shortages associated with
such an item are high enough to justify a more sophisticated control system than those proposed
for the less important B items in Chapters 4 through 6. This usually means a high annual dollar
usage (a high value of Dv). By usage we mean retail customer demand as well as usage, say, of spare
parts in production. In addition, one or more other factors may dictate that an item be placed in
the A category. For example, an item, although its sales are relatively low, may be essential to round
out the product line. To illustrate, a company may carry a high-end item for its prestige value. Poor
customer service on such an item may have adverse eﬀects on customers who buy large amounts

of other products in the line. In essence, the important issue is a trade-oﬀbetween control system
costs (such as the costs of collecting required data, performing the computations, providing action
reports, etc.) and the other three categories of costs mentioned above. (For simplicity, let us call
this latter group “other” costs.) By deﬁnition, these “other” costs for an A item will be appreciably
higher than for a B item. On the other hand, given that the same control system is used for an A and
a B item, the control costs will be essentially the same for the two items. A numerical example is in
order.
Consider two types of control systems: one simple, one complex. Suppose we have an A and a B
item with estimated “other” costs using the simple system of $900/year and $70/year, respectively.
It is estimated that the use of the complex control system will reduce these “other” costs by 10%.
However, the control costs of this complex system are estimated to be $40/year/item higher than
those incurred in using the simple system. The following table illustrates that the complex system
should be used for the A, but not for the B item.

+33
As mentioned above, the factor Dv is important in deciding whether or not to put an item
in the A category. However, the type of control to use within the A category should deﬁnitely
depend on the magnitudes of the individual components, D and v. As we see later in this chapter,
a high Dv resulting from a low D and a high v value (low unit sales of a high-value item) implies
diﬀerent control from a high Dv resulting from a high D and a low v value (high unit sales of a
low-value item). To illustrate, we would certainly control the inventories of the following two items
in diﬀerent ways:
Item 1: Midamatic ﬁlm processor, valued at $30,000, which sells at a rate of 2 per year.
Item 2: Developing chemical, valued at $2/liter, which sells at a rate of 30,000 liters per year.
Inventory control for items such as number 1 is addressed in Section 8.1, and for items such as
number 2 is examined in Sections 7.3 through 7.5.
7.2 Guidelines for Control of A Items
In Section II, which was concerned primarily with B items, we advocated a management by excep-
tion approach. That is, most decisions would be made by routine (computerized or manual) rules.
This should not be the case with A items. The potentially high payoﬀwarrants frequent manage-
rial attention to the replenishment decisions of individual items. Nonetheless, decision rules, based
on mathematical models, do have a place in aiding the manager. Normally, these models cannot
incorporate all the important factors. In such cases, the manager should incorporate subjective

Managing the Most Important Inventories
■

factors that were omitted from the model. The art of management is very evident in this type of
activity.
We now list a number of suggested guidelines for the control of A items. These may be above
and beyond what normally can be incorporated in a usable mathematical decision rule:
1. Inventory records should be maintained on a perpetual (transactions recording) basis, particularly
for the more expensive items. This need not be through the use of a computer system although
this will be the most common setting. Even if computer systems are available for all items,
our experience is that manual eﬀort is still required to maintain system and data accuracy;
thus, this eﬀort may not be warranted for items of lesser importance.
2. Keep top management informed. Frequent reports (e.g., monthly) should be prepared for at
least a portion of the A items. These should be made available to senior management for
careful review.
3. Estimate and inﬂuence demand. This can be done in three ways:
a.
Provide manual input to forecasts. For example, call your customers to get advance
warning of their needs.
b.
Ascertain the predictability of demand. Where the demand is of a special planned nature
(e.g., scheduled overhaul of a piece of equipment) or where adequate warning of the
need for a replacement part is given (e.g., a machine part fails but can be rapidly and
inexpensively repaired to last for suﬃcient time to requisition and receive a new part
from the supplier), there is no need to carry protection stock. In some cases, information
regarding the impending need for replacement parts can be gathered by monitoring a
system. Such information can be helpful in anticipating the need for replacement parts.
Jardine et al. (2006) discuss such condition-based maintenance approaches. When the
demand can occur without warning (i.e., a random breakdown), some protective stock
may be appropriate. When the unit value of an item is extremely high, it may make
sense to use a pool of spare parts shared among several companies within the same industry.
An example is in the ammonia manufacturing industry where certain spare parts are
maintained in a common pool.
c.
Manipulate a given demand pattern. Seasonal or erratic ﬂuctuations can sometimes be
reduced by altering price structures, negotiating with customers, smoothing shipments,
and so forth.
4. Estimate and inﬂuence supply. Again, it may not be advisable to passively accept a given pattern
of supply. Negotiations (e.g., establishing blanket orders and freeze periods) with suppliers
may reduce the average replenishment lead time, its variability, or both. The idea of a freeze
period is that the timing or size of a particular order cannot be altered within a freeze period
prior to its due date. In the same vein, it is very important to coordinate A item inventory
requirements in-house with the production scheduling department.
5. Use conservative initial provisioning. For A items that have a very high v value and a rela-
tively low D value, the initial provisioning decision becomes particularly crucial. For such
items, erroneous initial overstocking (due to overestimating the usage rate) can be extremely
expensive. Thus, it is a good idea to be conservative in initial provisioning.
6. Review decision parameters frequently. Generally, frequent review (as often as monthly or
bimonthly) of order points and order quantities is advisable for A items.
7. Determine precise values of control quantities. In Chapters 4 and 8, we consider the use of
tabular aids in establishing order quantities for B and C items. We argued that restricting
attention to a limited number of possible time supplies (e.g., 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months)

322
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
results in small cost penalties. This is not the case for A items. The percentage penalties may
still be small, but even small percentage penalties represent sizable absolute costs. Therefore,
order quantities of A items should be based on the most exact analysis possible.
8. Confront shortages as opposed to setting service levels. In Chapter 6, we pointed out that it is
often very diﬃcult to estimate the cost of shortages; as an alternative, we suggested specifying
a desired level of customer service instead. In most cases, we do not advocate this approach
for A items because of the typical management behavior in the short run in coping with
potential or actual shortages of such items. The response is not usually to sit back passively
and accept shortages of A items (or B items, for that matter). Instead, expediting (both in
and out of house), emergency air freight shipments, and other actions are undertaken. That
is, the shortages are avoided or eliminated quickly. Such actions, with associated costs that
can be reasonably estimated, should be recognized when establishing safety stocks to prevent
them. On the other hand, it should be pointed out that, in certain situations, customers are
willing to wait a short time for delivery. Because A items are replenished frequently, it may
be satisfactory to operate with very little on-hand stock (i.e., low safety stock) and, instead,
backorder and satisfy such demand from the next order due in very soon.
7.3 Simultaneous Determination of s and Q for
Fast-Moving Items
For fast-moving A items, we can usually rely on the normal distribution. We discuss the use of
alternative distributions in Chapter 8 where we address slow-moving items. We covered sequential
determination of s and Q in Chapter 6, noting there that the value of Q can often be constrained,
or at least inﬂuenced, by minimum order sizes or predetermined lot sizes. For very important items,
it may be valuable to simultaneously determine s and Q. In this section, we provide an example of
simultaneous determination for the case of a B1 shortage cost and normal lead time demand.*
First, we present the total cost equation for a general lead time demand distribution and a cost
per stockout occasion:
ETRC(s, Q) = AD/Q +
⎡
⎣Q/2 +
s
0
(s −x0)fx(x0)dx0
⎤
⎦vr + DB1
Q
∞
s
fx(x0)dx0
(7.1)
where the second term in the brackets is the safety stock, and the ﬁnal term is the shortage cost.
See the Appendix of Chapter 6 and Section 6.7.3 for more details. For the case of normal demand,
we have an approximation
ETRC(k, Q) = AD/Q + (Q/2 + kσL)vr + DB1
Q pu≥(k)
(7.2)
* Silver and Wilson (1972) develop similar results for a B2 cost and for (R, S) systems. For P2, Yano (1985) treats
the case of normal demand, and Moon and Choi (1994) addresses the case where we know only the mean and
variance of demand. See also Hill (1992). See Problem 7.13 for the formula for the B2 case. Finally, see Moon
and Gallego (1994) for the $/unit short case where we know only the mean and variance of demand.

where, as earlier,

A suggested iterative solution procedure is to initially set Q = EOQ; then solve for a corre-
sponding k value in Equation 7.4, and then use this value in Equation 7.3 to ﬁnd a new Q value,
and so forth. In certain cases, Equation 7.4 will have the square root of a negative number. In
this case, k is set at its lowest allowable value, as previously discussed in Section 6.7.5, and then
Q is obtained using this k value in Equation 7.3. Because of the convex nature of the functions
involved, convergence to the true simultaneous solution pair (Q and k) is ensured. For further
details concerning convexity, when the solution converges, and so on, refer to Chapter 4 of Hadley
and Whitin (1963) as well as to Problem 7.3.
Using functions and equations from Appendix III, it is faster to set up columns for an iteration
table. (See the table in the example below.) It is possible, however, simply to use two cells, one for
k and one for Q. These are deﬁned in terms of each other—k depends on Q, and Q depends on
k. Spreadsheet programs will give a “circular references” warning, but it can be safely ignored. The
spreadsheet will perform the number of iterations speciﬁed and converge on a solution. In all of
our tests, this happened almost instantaneously. See Problem 7.9.

Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
From Equation 7.3, we can see that the simultaneous Q is always larger than the EOQ. This
makes sense in view of Equation 7.2. The EOQ is the Q value that minimizes the sum of the ﬁrst
two cost components. However, at that value, the last term in Equation 7.2 is still decreasing as Q
increases. Thus, it pays to go somewhat above the EOQ.
Once we have ascertained that the simultaneous Q is larger than the EOQ, it follows from
Equation 7.4 that the simultaneous k is smaller than or equal to the sequential k. (They may
be equal because of the boundary condition of a lowest allowable k.) Again, this is intuitively
appealing—the larger Q value makes stockout opportunities less frequent; hence we can aﬀord to
carry less safety stock.
7.3.1.1 Numerical Illustration
For illustrative purposes, suppose that a ﬁrm was considering the use of a B1 shortage cost rule for
certain items with a B1 value of $32 per shortage occasion. One of these items has the following
characteristics:
D = 700 containers/year
v = $12/container
ˆxL = 100 containers
σL = 30 containers
Using the values of A = $3.20 and r = 0.24/year, we have that
EOQ =

simultaneous solution case is (Q +kσL)rv. In this case, it is [64+(0.98)(30)](0.24)(12) = $269.

7.3.2 Cost Penalties
The percentage penalty in costs (excluding those of the control system) resulting from using the
simpler sequential procedure in lieu of the sophisticated simultaneous approach is given by
PCP = [ETRC (sequential parameter values) −ETRC (simultaneous parameter values)]
ETRC (simultaneous parameter values)
(7.6)
where PCP is the percentage cost penalty and the ETRC (·) values are expected total relevant
costs (excluding system control costs) per unit time using the parameter values in the parentheses.
Figure 7.1 shows PCP as a function of two dimensionless parameters in Equation 7.4, EOQ/σL
and B1/A (note again the appearance of the EOQ). The curves have been terminated to the left
where the simultaneous solution ﬁrst gives k = 0.
7.3.2.1 Numerical Illustration of the Cost Penalty
For the item shown above
B1/A = 10
and
EOQ/σL = 1.3
Figure 7.1 shows the percentage cost penalty for the previous example is
PCP ≈4.21%
Now the sequential parameter values are quite easy to obtain. By the method of Section 6.7.5
Q = EOQ = 39 and k is selected to satisfy Equation 7.3:

Using Equation 7.2, we have
ETRC(1.39, 30) = $280.41
The absolute savings is $280.41 −$269.07 = $11.33/year. A savings of $11.33 per year for
an item that has an annual usage of $8,400 seems very small. If, however, the 4.2% savings applies
to many other A items, the total saved could be impressive. Therefore, it is worthwhile checking
some other items for similar savings.
7.3.3 Further Comments
We have seen that the simultaneous approach requires an iterative solution of two complicated
equations in two unknowns. (The situation is even more complicated for (R, S) systems. See

system for the case of a fixed cost per stockout occasion, B1.
Donaldson (1984) for a treatment of this case.) This amount of complexity should not be taken
lightly when considering the possible use of a simultaneous solution. Even though the solution is
very fast once the formulas are built into a spreadsheet, as noted above, we ﬁnd that the complexity
of the development of the formulas, and of the formulas themselves, generates resistance among
some managers. A somewhat simpler approach is presented by Platt et al. (1997), who developed
an accurate approximation for both s and Q when a ﬁll rate is used. Their approximation can be
built on a spreadsheet very easily, and is similar in development to the power approximation to
be discussed in Section 7.5.1. When the simultaneous approach is used, we would suggest the use
of a spreadsheet or another computerized routine. However, let us carefully examine the results of
Figure 7.1. Notice that the percentage cost penalty, for a ﬁxed value of B1/A, decreases as EOQ/σL
increases, that is, as the variability of demand decreases relative to the EOQ. This is to be expected
because the sequential approach computes the order quantity ignoring the variability. Furthermore,
the percentage penalties are quite low as long as EOQ/σL does not become too small.* Now, let us
look more closely at the factor EOQ/σL.

(7.7)
* Furthermore, Brown (1977) has suggested a pragmatic approach that eliminates the larger penalties. Speciﬁcally,
if EOQ < σL, simply use Q = σL and then ﬁnd k sequentially.

Managing the Most Important Inventories

327
As discussed in Chapter 3, some investigations have found evidence that, on average, σLv tends
to increase with Dv in the following manner:
σLv ≈c1(Dv)c2
where c2 is greater than 0.5. Substituting this in Equation 7.7 yields
EOQ
σL
≈

2ADv
rc2
1(Dv)2c2 ∝(Dv)0.5−c2
Because c2 is larger than 0.5, this says that, on the average, EOQ/σL decreases as Dv increases;
that is, low values of EOQ/σL are more likely with A items than with B or C items. From above,
this implies that the larger percentage errors in using the sequential approach are more likely to
occur with A items. This, together with the fact that the absolute costs associated with A items are
high, indicates that the sophisticated simultaneous procedures may be justiﬁed for some A items.
A corollary is that the absolute savings of a simultaneous approach are not likely to be justiﬁed for
B items; hence, we suggested the use of the simpler sequential approach in Chapter 6.
In an interesting study, Gallego (1998) shows that using the following formula for the order
size in a B3 cost situation in conjunction with the optimal s yields a cost no more than 6.07%
higher than the optimal. Therefore, a sequential approach may be used. His formula for the order
quantity is
EOQ(1 + σ2
Lv(r + B3)/(2AD))0.25
One ﬁnal comment: If Q is small, as is common when pallet-sized quantities are delivered
frequently, an order may not restore the inventory position to be greater than s. In such a case,
consider an (s, nQ) system in which an order of a multiple of Q insures that the inventory position
is greater than s at all times. See Zheng and Chen (1992) for a treatment of these policies.
7.4 Decision Rules for (s, S) Systems
We turn now to the commonly used (s, S) system. Once again we shall introduce a sequential
approach followed by a simultaneous approach. Recall from Chapter 6 that an (s, S) system assumes
continuous review. Whenever the inventory position drops to the reorder point s or lower, an order
is placed to raise the position to the order-up-to level S. When all transactions are of unit size, then
every order is of size (S −s) and is placed when the inventory position is exactly at the level s. We
can thus think of an order quantity
Q = S −s
(7.8)
and then the assumptions of an (s, Q) system (see Section 6.7.1 of Chapter 6) hold. Bartakke
(1981) has reported on the use of such a system under Poisson (unit-sized) demand at Sperry-
Univac. It is non-unit-sized transactions that complicate the analysis. Furthermore, in contrast to an
(R, S) system where each cycle of ﬁxed length R starts with the inventory position at the level S,
here, we have a cycle of random length (how long it takes for the inventory position to drop from
S to s or lower). Schneider (1979) shows that using an (s, Q) system in place of an (s, S) system
can severely reduce the obtained service level.
We now discuss the sequential and simultaneous approaches for selecting s and S under condi-
tions of non-unit-sized transactions. This is applied to one type of shortage-costing measure (cost

of B1 per stockout occasion) and normally distributed forecast errors. Other references on (s, S)
systems include Ward (1978); Archibald (1981); Williams (1982); Sahin (1982), and Federgruen
and Zipkin (1984). In addition, the related work of Tijms and Groenevelt (1984) will be discussed
in Section 7.5.2.
7.4.1 Simple Sequential Determination of s and S
In this ﬁrst approach, we choose to neglect the undershoots (how far below s the inventory position
is located when an order is placed). In addition, S and s are computed in a sequential fashion
as follows. The Q expression of Equation 7.8 is set equal to the economic order quantity as in
Chapter 4. Then, given this value of Q, we ﬁnd s by the procedure of Section 6.7.5 of Chapter 6.
Finally, from Equation 7.8, the S value is given by
S = s + Q
(7.9)
7.4.1.1 Numerical Illustration
Consider an item XMF-014 that is a 1,000-sheet box of 8-by-10-inch rapid-process x-ray ﬁlm. For
illustrative purposes, suppose that this ﬁrm was considering using an (s, S) control system for this
item. Relevant given characteristics of the item include
D = 1,400 boxes/year
v = $5.90/box
A = $3.20
r = 0.24 $/$/year
B1 = $150
ˆxL = 270 boxes
σL = 51.3 boxes
The use of the above-outlined procedure leads to
Q = 80 boxes
s = 389 boxes
S = 469 boxes
7.4.2 Simultaneous Selection of s and S Using the
Undershoot Distribution
In the second approach, we select s and S simultaneously and also attempt to take account of
the nonzero undershoots. A stockout occurs if the sum of the undershoot plus the total lead time
demand exceeds s. Thus, the variable in which we are interested is
x′ = z + x
where z is the undershoot and x is the total lead time demand.
We know the distribution of x (assumed to be normal). The distribution of z is quite complex,
depending in general on the distance S −s and the probability distribution of transaction sizes.

However, when S −s is considerably larger than the average transaction size, we can make use of a
result developed by Karlin (1958), namely,
pz(z0) =
1
E(t)
∞

t0=z0+1
pt(t0)
(7.10)
where
pz(z0) = probability that the undershoot is of size z0
pt(t0) = probability that a demand transaction is of size t0
E(t) = average transaction size
Equation 7.10 can be used to compute the mean and variance of the undershoot variable z.

For convenience, we assume that x′ has a normal distribution‡ with the mean and variance
given above. With this assumption, the method, whose derivation closely parallels that shown
Appendix of this chapter, is as follows:

Q = EOQ

* Baganha et al. (1999) develop a simple algorithm to compute the undershoot. And Baganha et al. (1996) show
that for most common demand distributions, the mean and variance given here are quite close to the actual
values if Q > 2E(t). See also Hill (1988) who examines the cost of ignoring the undershoot and develops an
approximation for it.
† Janssen et al. (1998) show that it is better to measure both the undershoot and the lead time demand, and then
use this data in setting reorder points.
‡ x is normally distributed but z is certainly not. Equation 7.10 reveals that pz(zo) is monotonically decreasing
with zo. Hence, the assumption of (z + x) having a normal distribution is only an approximation.

7.4.3 Comparison of the Methods
It is interesting to compare the results of the two methods for the numerical illustration of item
XMF-014. Archibald (1976) has developed a search procedure that ﬁnds the optimal (s, S) pair for
an arbitrary discrete distribution of transaction sizes and also gives the exact expected total relevant
costs for any (s, S) pair used (see also Archibald and Silver 1978). Utilizing his procedure, we found
the results shown in Table 7.1. Observe that the simultaneous method, which takes account of the
undershoot, leads to a solution negligibly close to the optimum. Note that, even with the signiﬁcant
departure from unit-sized transactions shown in the numerical illustration, the sequential approach
of Chapter 6 still gives a cost penalty of only 3.5%. Based on results of this type, we suggest the
use of the simpler procedures of Chapter 6 unless the demand is erratic in nature (deﬁned in
Chapter 3 as when ˆσ1 exceeds the demand level a, where both are measured over a unit time
period). In addition, when a savings of 3%–4% represents a signiﬁcant amount of money, one
should use the simultaneous method or one of the more advanced procedures referenced earlier.
Nevertheless, it is often worthwhile to check a small sample of items to see if the potential savings
are greater.

Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
7.5 Decision Rules for (R, s, S) Systems
As mentioned in Chapter 6, it has been shown that, under quite general conditions, the system
that minimizes the total of review, replenishment, carrying, and shortage costs will be a member of
the (R, s, S) family. However, the determination of the exact best values of the three parameters is
extremely diﬃcult. The problem results partly from the fact that undershoots of the reorder point
s are present even if all transactions are unit-sized. This is because we only observe the inventory
level every R units of time. Because of the complexity of exact analyses, we again advocate and
illustrate the use of heuristic approaches. Some are simple enough that they could also be used for
the control of B items. Hence, in Section 7.5.2, we demonstrate the use of a service constraint that
would normally not be employed for A items. It is important to note, however, that Zheng and
Federgruen (1991) have developed a fast algorithm for ﬁnding the optimal s and S for a given R and
for discrete demand distributions. This algorithm is best developed using a programming language,
or macros with a spreadsheet, rather than a simple spreadsheet. For applications in companies that
can aﬀord the programming time, this algorithm would be an excellent choice.
7.5.1 Decision Rule for a Specified Fractional Charge (B3) per Unit
Short at the End of Each Period
We now present a heuristic method, known as the revised power approximation. The original
power approximation was suggested by Ehrhardt (1979) and the revision was proposed by Ehrhardt
and Mosier (1984). An interesting alternative approach has been developed by Naddor (1975).
The revised power approximation determines values of the two control parameters Q = S −s
and s. We ﬁrst show the approximation and then brieﬂy discuss its nature and its derivation.

Consider a particular item having R = 1/2 month and L = 1 month. Other relevant characteristics
are D = 1,200 units/year, A = $25, v = $2/unit, r = 0.24 $/$/year, B3 = 0.2 $/$ short/period,
and σR+L = 60 units.

Therefore, from Equations 7.18 and 7.19, we have

S = 157 + 367 = 524 units
7.5.1.3 Discussion
The rules were derived in the following fashion. Roberts (1962) developed analytic forms for Q
and s that hold for large values of A and B3. Somewhat more general forms of the same nature were
assumed containing a number of parameter values; for example,
Qp = aˆx1−b
R
 A
vr
b !

(7.24)
where a, b, and c are parameters.
Optimal values of Q = S −s and s were found (by a laborious procedure not practical for rou-
tine operational use) for a wide range of representative problems, and the values of the parameters
(e.g., a, b, and c in Equation 7.24) were determined by a regression ﬁt to these optimal results. In
the case of Qp, this led to Equation 7.15. Equations 7.16 and 7.17 were found in much the same
way.
Step 3 is necessary because, when Qp/ˆxR is small enough, Roberts’ limiting policy is no longer
appropriate; in eﬀect, we are reduced to an order every review interval, that is, an (R, S) system.
Equation 7.21 can be derived in the same fashion as Equation 6.23 of Section 6.7.7 of Chap-
ter 6, except using the more accurate representation for the expected on-hand stock footnoted in
Section 6.7.3.
Note that as σR+L →0, Equation 7.15 gives a result close to the basic economic order quan-
tity. Extensive tests by Ehrhardt (1979) and Ehrhardt and Mosier (1984) have shown that the
approximation performs extremely well in most circumstances.
There has been much research on (R, s, S) policies, including that of Zheng and Federgruen
(1991). Porteus (1985) tests many methods for ﬁnding near-optimal (s, S) values with B3 costing,
including an older version of the power approximation. He also examines whether using the B2
method described in Section 6.7.6 works well in the B3 case. (Not surprisingly, it does not.) The
paper provides an algorithm that works very well on a wide range of parameter values. See also
Ehrhardt et al. (1981) for the case of autocorrelated demand, which might be observed by a ware-
house that supplies retailers who themselves order using (s, S) policies. For a similar approximation
for random lead times, see Ehrhardt (1984). See also Naddor (1978).
7.5.2 Decision Rule for a Specified Fraction (P2) of Demand Satisfied
Directly from Shelf
For the case of a ﬁll rate constraint, we present a heuristic procedure (due to Tijms and Groenevelt
1984), which, incidentally, can be adapted for use within the (s, S) context of Section 7.4, as well as
for the P1 and TBS service measures. Schneider (1978, 1981) used a somewhat diﬀerent approach
to derive the same results. We show the decision rule, followed by a numerical illustration, and

then provide a brief discussion concerning the rule. The underlying assumptions are basically the
same as those presented in Section 6.9.3 for (R, S) systems except, of course, now an order is placed
at a review instant only if the inventory position is at or below s. We show illustrative details only
for the case of normally distributed demand. This is appropriate to use as long as (CV )R+L ≤0.5
where (CV )R+L = σR+L/ˆxR+L is the coeﬃcient of variation of demand over R + L. When CV
exceeds 0.5, a gamma distribution provides better results (see Tijms and Groenevelt 1984; and
Section 6.7.14 of Chapter 6) because, with such a high value of CV, a normal distribution would
lead to a signiﬁcant probability of negative demands.

where

Ju(k) = ∞

Note that, as shown by Hadley and Whitin (1963),
Ju(k) = (1 + k2)pu≥(k) −kfu(k)
(7.26)
so that Ju(k) can be evaluated easily. We have developed a column in Table II.1 of Appendix II for
Ju(k) using the rational approximation described in Appendix III.
Equation 7.25 requires, in general, a trial-and-error-type solution. However, in the event that
the desired service level is high enough (P2 ≥0.9), the demand pattern is relatively smooth and R
is not too small compared with L; then the second term on the left side of Equation 7.25 can be
ignored. Thus, if we set
s = ˆxR+L + kσR+L
(7.27)
the decision rule reduces to selecting k so as to satisfy

If a table of Ju(k) versus k is available, then ﬁnding the appropriate k poses no diﬃculty. Alter-
natively, one can use rational functions to ﬁnd k from Ju(k) as suggested by Schneider (1981) and
presented in Appendix III. These are easily implemented on a spreadsheet. Using Appendix III,
ﬁnding Ju(k) from k is also easy on a spreadsheet.
7.5.2.2 Numerical Illustration
We illustrate a situation where the simpler Equation 7.28 can be used. Suppose a ﬁrm is controlling
a particular item on a periodic basis with R = 2 weeks and the lead time L = 1 week. Assume

336
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
that S −s has been preestablished as 100 units. The forecast update period is 2 weeks and current
estimates are ˆx1 = 50 units and σ1 = 15 units, where the subscript, 1, indicates one forecast
interval rather than 1 week. Suppose that P2 = 0.95. First, we evaluate
ˆxR = ˆx1 = 50 units
ˆxR+L = ˆx3/2 = 75 units
σR = σ1 = 15 units
σR+L = σ3/2 =

3/2σ1 = 18.4 units
(CV )R+L = σR+L
ˆxR+L
= 18.4
75 = 0.25 < 0.5
Thus, an assumption of normally distributed demand is reasonable. From Equation 7.28, we have
(18.4)2Ju(k) = 2(1 −0.95)50

100 + (15)2 + (50)2
2(50)

or
Ju(k) = 1.885
Using Table II.1 or Appendix III, we ﬁnd that
k ≈−0.98
Thus, from Equation 7.27, the reorder point is given by
s = 75 −0.98(18.4)
≈57 units
Finally,
S = s + (S −s) = 57 + 100 = 157 units
Incidentally, the use of the more complicated Equation 7.25 produces the same results in this
example.
7.5.2.3 Discussion
To derive the decision rule, use, as in Chapter 6,
1 −P2 = Expected shortage per replenishment cycle
Expected replenishment size
(7.29)
As in Section 7.4.2, the key random variable is the total of the undershoot z (of the reorder
point) and the demand x in a lead time. The denominator of Equation 7.29 leads to the term in
square brackets in Equation 7.25. The numerator in Equation 7.29 is developed based on
∞
S
(x′ −s)fx′(x′
0)dx′

337
where x′ = z + x. The result, after lengthy calculus, turns out to be the left side of Equation 7.25,
divided by 2 ˆxR.
For other research in this area, see Chen and Krass (1995) who discuss a “marginal service
level” which is the minimum fraction of demand met from the shelf in any period. Thus, it is
analogous to the ﬁll rate (P2) but it applies in any period rather than as a long-term average. They
also describe analogies for the P1 case. They show that (s, S) policies are optimal and provide a fast
algorithm for ﬁnding the optimal values of s and S. Schneider and Ringuest (1990) present a power
approximation for a ready rate service level. Also, for non-normal distributions, see Section 6.7.14
of Chapter 6. See also Schneider and Rinks (1989).
7.6 Coping with Nonstationary Demand
As discussed in Chapter 5, the average demand rate may vary appreciably with time. This should
have an impact on the choice of control parameters such as s and Q for a continuous review system
(or analogous parameters for periodic review systems). In some cases, nonstationary demand can
be handled directly by the forecasting process from which we get the point forecast ˆxt,t+L and
standard deviation of forecast errors σt,t+L for demand over the next L periods.* Harrison (1967)
presents expressions for the standard deviation of forecast errors over the lead time for both simple
exponential smoothing and exponential smoothing with trend. It is worth emphasizing here that
the degree of nonstationarity in the demand can have a signiﬁcant impact on the necessary safety
stock. As an example, consider a setting where demand is being forecasted with a simple exponential
smoothing model. Furthermore, let σ represent the standard deviation of the one-period ahead
forecast error and let α be the ideal smoothing constant for the forecasting process.† For a given
safety factor k, the level of safety stock is
kσt,t+L = kσ
√
L

1 + α(L −1) + α2(L −1)(2L −1)
6
(7.30)
Note that if demand is stationary (e.g., the average level does not change over time), the ideal fore-
casting model would be to not smooth forecasts (α = 0), and the level of safety stock becomes
kσ
√
R + L; that is, the required level of safety stock is proportional to the square root of the pro-
tection interval R + L. When the underlying level of demand varies over time, the ideal smoothing
constant α is greater than zero, and more safety stock is needed for the same protection level.
This relationship, shown in Figure 7.2, is important to remember since often forecast errors are
reported for a ﬁxed time lag, such as one-period ahead, rather than over the lead time. For expo-
nential smoothing with trend (Harrison 1967), where σ is the one-step ahead standard deviation
of forecast errors and the ideal smoothing constants are α and β, the required level of safety stock is
kσt,t+L = kσ
.

required protection period.

The above expressions can be used when demand is best forecasted with simple exponential
smoothing or exponential smoothing with trend and one-period ahead forecast errors are measured
and reported. An exact analysis of general time-varying and probabilistic demand is far too com-
plicated for routine use in practice. Therefore, again we adopt heuristic approaches. If the average
demand rate changes with time, then the values of the control parameters should also change with
time. From a pragmatic standpoint, frequent changes in R, the review interval, for a periodic review
system are awkward to implement. Thus, changes in R, if made at all, should be very infrequent.
One appealing approach to adjusting s and Q (or s and S) with time is to compute these values in a
particular period t using demand (forecast) information over the immediately following interval of
duration L or R + L as appropriate, but still using an underlying steady-state model. This is equiv-
alent, in the terminology of Chapter 5, to using a rolling horizon of length R + L. Silver (1978)
uses much the same idea but allows the demand rate to vary within the current horizon. This is
accomplished by using safety stock considerations to decide when to place an order, followed by
the deterministic Silver–Meal heuristic to select the size of the then current replenishment. Askin
(1981) also addresses this problem. In a similar vein, Vargas (1994) develops a stochastic version
of the Wagner–Whitin model described in Chapter 5. See also Vargas and Metters (1996).
One paper of interest is by Bollapragada and Morton (1993), who develop a myopic heuristic
that is very fast and very accurate. Their heuristic involves precomputing the (s, S) values for
various values of mean demand, possibly using methods of this chapter. Then they approximate
the nonstationary problem by a stationary one—essentially, averaging the nonstationary demand
over an estimate of the optimal time between orders (obtained from the stationary problem) and
reading the corresponding (s, S) values from the precomputed table. Tests show that the error of
using the heuristic averages only 1.7%. This heuristic is easy to implement, but should be avoided

if demand is expected to decline rapidly as a product becomes obsolete. Chapters 8 and 9 address
this latter case.
Additional related work on this problem includes Eilon and Elmaleh (1970), Lasserre et al.
(1985), LeFrancois and Cherkez (1987), Popovic (1987), Bookbinder and Tan (1988), Zipkin
(1989), Wang and Rao (1992), Zinn et al. (1992), Charnes et al. (1995), Marmorstein and Zinn
(1993), Cheng and Sethi (1999), Metters (1997), Ernst and Powell (1995), Morton and Pentico
(1995), Chen and Krass (1995), and Anupindi et al. (1996).
A complexity to be faced under general, time-varying probabilistic demand, even in some of
the simple procedures mentioned above, is the estimation of σt,t+R+L, the standard deviation of
forecast errors for a forecast, made in period t, of demand over the next R + L periods. In the
exponential smoothing models discussed above, even though the level (and perhaps trend) of the
demand are varying over time, the standard deviation of forecast errors is not. In general, and
unlike in earlier discussions, we cannot make the assumption that σt,t+R+L = σR+L. Where the
average demand rate changes with time, it is possible and perhaps likely that σ will also vary. A
pragmatic approach to the estimation σt,t+R+L is to use an aggregate relationship, ﬁrst mentioned
in conjunction with estimating σ’s of new items in Section 3.8.1 of Chapter 3, of the form
σt,t+R+L = c1ˆxc2
t,t+R+L
(7.32)
where ˆxt,t+R+L is the forecast, made in period t, of total demand over the next R + L periods, and
c1 and c2 are constants estimated for a population of items (as discussed in Chapter 4). Another
approach, taken by Bollapragada and Morton (1993), is to assume a constant ratio of the standard
deviation to the mean (i.e., c2 = 1).
7.7 Comments on Multiple Sources of Supply and Expediting
Many ﬁrms are trying to reduce their number of suppliers because of the cost of managing multiple
relationships. It takes time and eﬀort to maintain good relationships with many diﬀerent vendors.
The buying ﬁrm must verify the quality of delivered parts, and often is required to work with the
vendor to reduce the cost of those parts. Perhaps the most important factor in an industry that
competes on time-to-market is the new product development cost. If the ﬁrm has multiple suppli-
ers for a given part, the purchasing and engineering staﬀs must work with many vendors to insure
that parts for the new products are of high quality and are ready on time. Nevertheless, from an
inventory management perspective, costs can decrease if there are more suppliers. Most research
in inventory theory disregards factors such as quality, time to market, and the cost of managing
relationships. Unfortunately, in our discussions with managers, even at large and respected auto-
motive ﬁrms, the inventory implications of sourcing decisions are often ignored. In this section,
we comment brieﬂy on research that should be a useful addition to decisions that are usually made
on more qualitative grounds.
If multiple suppliers are used, the inventory equations developed in this chapter and in Chap-
ter 6 must be modiﬁed. In general, the dual-sourcing models discussed here seek to balance the use
of the two supply modes to get as much of the cost advantage from the slow source while keeping
safety stock levels close to what could be achieved based on only the fast supply mode. There are
two related challenges with dual-sourcing models. First, the resulting control policy should not be
so complicated that it cannot be implemented in practice. Second, the analysis for dual-sourcing

340
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
systems is typically much more complicated, so one can expect greater eﬀort to be required to iden-
tify good values for control parameters. Moinzadeh and Nahmias (1988) developed an approximate
model for an inventory system with two possible suppliers, one having a shorter lead time. They
deﬁned a procedure for ﬁnding approximately optimal values of s and Q for both suppliers. (See
also Moinzadeh and Schmidt 1991.) Kelle and Silver (1990) discussed order splitting among two
or more vendors so that the average and variance of replenishment lead time are reduced. Lau and
Zhao (1993) investigated a similar problem and discovered that the major advantage of order split-
ting is the reduction of cycle inventory cost. This result contrasts with earlier work that focused
on reduction in safety stock. Guo and Ganeshan (1995) provided simple decision rules to ﬁnd the
optimal number of suppliers for particular lead time distributions. See also Sculli and Wu (1981),
Ramasesh et al. (1991), Lau and Zhao (1994), Chiang and Benton (1994), Ernst et al. (2007),
Fong and Gempesaw (1996), Parlar and Perry (1996), Zhang (1997), Chiang and Chiang (1996),
and Feng and Shi (2012).
Veeraraghavan and Scheller-Wolf (2008) developed an approach for a relatively simple “dual
index” policy for a periodic review system where orders for the two supply modes are determined
based on two target inventory levels. At each ordering instance, two orders are placed: (1) an order
with the fast lead time supply source to bring the total of on-hand and on-order inventory that
will arrive within the fast lead time up to a speciﬁed target inventory level, and (2) an order with
the slow lead time supplier to bring on-hand plus on-order inventory up to another (higher) target
inventory level. While some computational eﬀort is involved in ﬁnding the two control parameters,
the authors demonstrate on a broad set of numerical experiments that the best dual-index policy
is quite close to optimal. Their model can also accommodate capacity constraints on the supply
sources.
Motivated by a setting where supply from China and Mexico was used to meet U.S. demand,
Allon and Van Mieghem (2010) developed a “base-surge” approach to managing two supply
sources where a constant “base” volume is sourced from the long lead time source and the fast
lead time source is used to react to variations in demand (“surge”). For stationary demand, the
authors developed an expression for the near-optimal long-term volume to be allocated to the slow
source. This prescription may serve as a reasonable estimate even when demand is nonstationary.
See also Boute and Van Mieghem (2014), Jain et al. (2010, 2011), and Sheopuri et al. (2010).
A related problem is when to place an emergency order if a replenishment order is late or can-
not meet a surge in demand. White and White (1992) investigated the problem of setting the
inventory policy for this case, and found that the cost of emergency ordering may be more than
oﬀset by reductions in inventory carrying costs. Dhakar et al. (1994) investigated an (S −1, S)
inventory system for high-cost repairable items that has three possible modes of replenishment:
normal repair orders, emergency repair orders, and expediting outstanding orders. They use a sim-
ulation procedure to ﬁnd S and an expediting threshold. Kalpakam and Sapna (1995) addressed a
lost sales inventory system in which orders are placed at two levels s(> 0) and zero, with ordering
quantities Q > s and s, respectively. Finally, in an interesting paper, Song and Zipkin (1996) dis-
cussed a system in which replenishment lead times evolve over time as the system changes. They
found that a longer lead time does not necessarily imply more inventory. A related work, Ben-Daya
and Raouf (1994), addressed an inventory system in which lead time is a decision variable, which
can be reduced at a cost. There is a signiﬁcant amount of research on the inventory problem when
the quantity supplied does not necessarily exactly match the quantity ordered. Costa and Silver
(1996) have dealt with the situation where supply is uncertain, but diﬀerent levels of supply can
be reserved ahead of time. See also Lee and Moinzadeh (1987, 1989), Gerchak et al. (1988), Yano
and Lee (1995), and Wang and Gerchak (1996).

7.8 Summary
In this chapter, we have dealt with the most important class of items, namely, A items. Procedures,
more elaborate than those in earlier chapters, have been suggested. Where analytic models cannot
incorporate all important factors and still be solvable by deductive reasoning, it may very well
be worthwhile in the case of A items to resort to simulation methods that are much broader in
applicability but more expensive to use. (See Section 2.7 of Chapter 2.)
In the next chapter, we turn to the opposite end of the spectrum, namely, C items. However,
in later chapters, where we deal with coordination among items, A and B items will again play a
prominent role.
Problems
7.1
Consider an (s, Q) system of control for a single item and with normally distributed forecast
errors.
a. Find an expression that k must satisfy given a Q value if we wish to have an expected
number of stockout occasions per year equal to N.
b. Derive the two simultaneous equations that Q and k must satisfy if we wish to minimize
the total expected costs of replenishment and carrying inventory subject to the expected
number of stockout occasions per year being N.
c. For the following example, develop Q, k, and the associated total relevant costs per year
for two strategies:
i. Q = EOQ and corresponding k
ii. Simultaneous best (Q, k) pair
Item characteristics:

Ceiling Drug is concerned about the inventory control of an important item. Currently,
they are using an (s, Q) system where Q is the EOQ and the safety factor k is selected based
on a B2v shortage-costing method. Relevant parameter values are estimated to be

B2 = 0.6
v = $10/unit
ˆxL = 500 units
A = $5
σL = 100 units
r = 0.25$/$/year
a. What are the Q and s values currently in use?
b. Determine the simultaneous best values of Q and s.
c. What is the percent penalty (in the total of replenishment, carrying, and shortage costs)
of using the simpler sequential approach?

Consider a situation where the lowest allowable k value is 0. The B1 shortage-costing
method is appropriate.
a. On a plot of k versus Q/σL sketch each of Equations 7.3 and 7.4. (Hint: For each,
evaluate dk/d(Q/σL). Also look at the behavior of each for limiting values of k and
Q/σL).
b. Attempt to ascertain under precisely what conditions there will be no simultaneous
solution of the two equations.
c. Verify, using Equation 7.2, that under such circumstances the cost-minimizing solution
is to set k = 0 and
Q/σL = EOQ/σL

1 + 0.5B1/A
7.4
In relation to an (s, Q) inventory control system, an operations analyst has made the
following observation:
Suppose we determine Q from the EOQ; then ﬁnd the safety factor from the “fraction
demand satisﬁed routinely from shelf” criterion. Suppose that through explicit cost consid-
erations we estimate r to be a particular value rl. Now if we deliberately set r at a lower value
r2, when determining Q and s, we can reduce actual total relevant costs.
a. Could the analyst be telling the truth? Attempt to develop an analytic proof.
b. Illustrate with an item having the following characteristics:
Dv = $4000/year
σLv = $500
A = $100
P2 = 0.975
rl = 0.2$/$/year
7.5
Company X has an A item which it controls by an (s, S) system. The item has only a few
customers. According to the (s, S) policy, if a large order drives the inventory position to or
below s, enough is ordered to raise the position to S. Discuss the implicit cost trade-oﬀthat
the company is making in still raising the position to S even after a large demand has just
occurred.
7.6
a. Consider an item for which an (R, s, S) system is used. The review interval is 1 week.
Other characteristics include
L = 2 weeks
r = 0.26$/$/year
D = 800 units/year
B3 = 0.30$/$ short/week
A = $20
σR+L = 14.2 units
v = $1.50/unit
Using the revised power approximation, ﬁnd the appropriate values of s and S.
(Assume that there are exactly 52 weeks per year.)
b. Repeat for another item with the same characteristics except v = $150 /unit.

An oil distribution depot supplies customers by road tanker. The depot itself is supplied
by a unit train with 24 cars, each with a capacity of 75 tons. At the depot, three diﬀerent
products are stored in eight 1,000-ton tanks. At present, three tanks are used for product A,
three tanks for product B, and two tanks for product C. Analysis of demand records shows
that the average weekly demand for product A is 600 tons with a standard deviation 400

tons, average weekly demand for product B is 500 tons with a standard deviation 300 tons,
and average weekly demand for product C is 400 tons with a standard deviation 200 tons.
Any seasonal eﬀects can be ignored. The stock level of each product is reported by the depot
to the reﬁnery every Monday morning. The distribution oﬃce then has to decide whether
to replenish the depot the following Friday and, if so, how many cars of the train should
be ﬁlled with each product. The cost of operating the train is not reduced if any cars are
empty and is approximately $3,000 per trip. If a product runs out at the depot, then the
road tankers have to be diverted from that depot to another depot at considerably higher
cost.
a. How does the limited capacity tankage at the depot aﬀect the applicability of standard
inventory control models?
b. Are there any other features of the problem that make standard inventory control
models diﬃcult to apply?
c. Without doing any detailed numerical calculations, indicate the type of inventory control
guidelines that you could propose for the distribution oﬃce.
d. Brieﬂy indicate what other (if any) types of data you would need. Also, what type of
solution procedure (for ﬁnding precise values of control parameters within the general
control guidelines of part c) do you think would be needed?
7.8
A particular inventory control manager places orders for very expensive items. A report ﬁled
by an outside consultant included the following quotes. Comment on each.
a. “He tried to order only enough items to meet actual sales for the 1-month period, one
lead time period ahead.” Comment in particular the choice of a 1-month period.
b. “To meet unexpected demand he usually ordered 10%–20% more than the number of
units he was able to identify through purchase orders or commitments.”
7.9
Develop a spreadsheet approach for Equations 7.3 and 7.4. First develop a table for
iteration. Then use fewer cells by using circular references.
7.10
Repeat Problem 7.2 using B1 = $100 in place of B2 = 0.6.
7.11
Consider the item in Problem 7.2 and assume that the sequential approach is used. Suppose
that, through improved forecasting, σL can be reduced to 70 units. Up to what extra amount
per year should the company be willing to pay to achieve this improved forecasting?
7.12
Air Alberta has been using an (s, Q) control system for a fast-moving spare part for one of
its types of aircraft. The properties of this part are
D = 1,920 units/year
A = $15
v = $20.00/unit
r = 0.2$/$/year
ˆxL = 150 units
σL = 60 units
Whenever a shortage is impending, an expediting action is taken, avoiding the shortage. The
cost of such an expedite is roughly $200, independent of the magnitude of the impending
shortage. The company uses an EOQ as the order quantity.
a. Determine the EOQ and s.
b. What are the expected total relevant costs (replenishing, carrying, and expediting) per
year?
c. A management science graduate, working in Air Alberta’s operations research depart-
ment, says that increasing Q to 5% above the EOQ will reduce the expected total
relevant costs per year? Can he be right? Discuss.

An arrangement, sometimes made between a supplier and a customer, is what is called a
“standing” order. Under this arrangement, the supplier ships a ﬁxed quantity Qf at regular
intervals (R time units apart) throughout the year. Because of the customer commitment for
regular shipments, the supplier oﬀers an attractive unit cost, vf . However, because demand is
variable, special auxiliary orders must be placed from time to time and/or one or more of the
standard shipments may have to be postponed for R units of time. Suppose a particular steel
products distributor, Salem Inc., is considering a standing order arrangement for a speciﬁc
product with a supplier, Jericho Steel. The demand rate for this product averages 12,000
units/year. For a standing order arrangement of 1,000 units each month, Jericho oﬀers a unit
price (including shipment cost) of $2.00/unit. Without a standing order arrangement, the
unit price (including shipment cost) is $2.20/unit. The Salem inventory manager estimates
that the ﬁxed cost associated with any standing order is $25, whereas the ﬁxed cost of
any other order is $35. Salem uses a carrying charge of 0.26 $/$/year. If a standing order
arrangement is adopted, auxiliary orders can only be placed so as to arrive with standing
orders (the lead time for such an auxiliary order is 1 month; in fact, this is the lead time
of any nonstandard order). The decision to postpone a standard order also must be made
1 month before its scheduled arrival. Assume that demands in non-overlapping periods are
independent, normally distributed variables with a standard deviation of 250 units for a
1 month period. Salem wishes to ensure a maximum probability of 0.03 of a stockout on
any replenishment.
a. If the standing order policy was adopted, indicate how you would assist Salem in
deciding on
i. When to place an auxiliary order
ii. When to postpone a standard order
b. Indicate how you might use a model to ascertain whether Salem should even adopt the
standing order arrangement.

We let
s = ˆxL + kσL
From Equation 7.2, the expected total relevant costs per unit time under use of a safety factor
k and an order quantity Q are given by
ETRC(k, Q) = AD/Q + (Q/2 + kσL)vr + DB1
Q pu≥(k)
To reduce the number of separate parameters that have to be considered, we normalize by
multiplying both sides by the constant term 2/vrσL. We refer to the result as the normalized total

Chapter 8
Managing Slow-Moving
and Low-Value (Class C)
Inventories
Slow-moving and low-value items often fall in the C category or so-called “cats and dogs,” although
as noted in Chapter 7, slow-moving items may be important enough to be included in the A or B
category. Collectively, these items usually represent an appreciable percentage of the total number
of distinct SKUs, but a small fraction of the total dollar investment in the inventory of a typical
company. Most of these items taken singly are relatively unimportant, but, because of their large
numbers, appropriate simple control procedures must be used. In this chapter, we discuss such
methods.
In Section 8.1, decision rules are presented for important (e.g., high-value or critical) slow-
moving items using (s, Q) systems. The special case of intermittent demand for high-unit-value
items is discussed in Section 8.2. Section 8.3 spells out in greater detail the nature of C items
and the primary objectives in designing methods for controlling them. In Section 8.4, we propose
control procedures for low-value items having relatively steady demand. Speciﬁcally, we consider,
in order, the type of inventory records to use, the selection of the reorder quantity (or reorder
interval), and the choice of the reorder point (or order-up-to level). Next, in Section 8.5, we treat
the case of items with signiﬁcantly declining usage patterns, that is, approaching the termination of
usage. Section 8.6 is concerned with the important issue of removing totally (or relatively) inactive
items from the organization’s inventory. Finally, in Section 8.7, we address the related question of
whether demands for a particular item should be purchased (made) to order or met from stock.
8.1 Order-Point, Order-Quantity (s, Q) Systems for
Slow-Moving A Items
In Chapter 6, for the case of B items, we argued for the almost exclusive use of the normal dis-
tribution to represent the distribution of forecast errors over a lead time. For A items, where the
351

■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
potential beneﬁts of using a more accurate representation are higher, we suggest, based on extensive
tests (see Tyworth and O’Neill 1997), still using the normal distribution if the average (or forecast)
demand in a lead time is high enough (at least 10 units). As mentioned in Chapter 6, we advocate
the use of explicit (or implicit) costing of shortages. Therefore, decision rules such as those in Sec-
tions 6.7.5 through 6.7.8 of Chapter 6 should be used. If the average,* ˆxL, is below 10 units, then
a discrete distribution, such as the Poisson, is more appropriate. (See the Appendix of this chapter
for a discussion of some properties of the distribution and a derivation of expected units short per
cycle. See Appendix III for details on how to ﬁnd expected units short per cycle using common
spreadsheet functions.)
The Poisson distribution has but a single parameter, namely, the average demand (in this case,
ˆxL). Once ˆxL is speciﬁed, a value of the standard deviation of forecast errors, σL, follows from the
Poisson relation
σL =

ˆxL
(8.1)
Therefore, the Poisson is appropriate to use only when the observed σL (for the item under
consideration) is quite close to

ˆxL. An operational deﬁnition of “quite close” is within 10%
of

ˆxL. When this is not the case, somewhat more complicated discrete distributions such as the
negative binomial (see Taylor 1961; Porteus 1985; Aggarwal and Moinzadeh 1994) or a compound
Poisson (see, e.g., Adelson 1966; Feeney and Sherbrooke 1966; Mitchell et al. 1983) should be
considered.
The discrete nature of the Poisson distribution (in contrast, the normal distribution deals with
a continuous variable) is both a blessing and a curse. For slow-moving items, it is important to
be able to deal with discrete units. On the other hand, discrete mathematics create problems in
implementation, as we will soon see. In most of our discussions in Chapter 6, there were two
control parameters per item:
s and Q in an (s, Q) system
R and S in an (R, S) system
Our approach was ﬁrst to determine one of the parameters—namely, Q or R; then (sequen-
tially) to ﬁnd the best value of the second parameter, s or S, conditional on the value of Q or R,
respectively. The derivation of the value of Q or R ignored the eﬀect that this parameter has on
the service level or shortage costs per unit time. To illustrate, consider the (s, Q) control system
with a ﬁxed cost B1 per stockout occasion. From Section 6A.1 of the Appendix of Chapter 6 and
Section 6.7.5, the total relevant costs per year, ETRC, are
AD/Q + (Q/2)vr + (SS)vr + DB1
Q
× (Probability of a stockout in a cycle)
(8.2)
where SS is the safety stock.
The approach, advocated in Chapter 6, was ﬁrst to pick the Q value that minimizes the ﬁrst two
terms, ignoring the last two terms; then to choose the best value of safety stock (or kσL in the case of
normal demand). But, clearly, the value of Q inﬂuences the shortage costs (the last term). The larger
the Q is, the smaller these costs become. The exact approach would be to simultaneously determine
* In an (R, S) system ˆxL, the average demand in a lead time would be replaced by ˆxR+L, the average demand in a
review interval plus a lead time.

Managing Slow-Moving and Low-Value (Class C) Inventories

SS and Q to minimize the ETRC expression.* As we saw in Chapter 7, this exact approach is
more involved from both a conceptual and a computational standpoint. Furthermore, the order
quantity is no longer the simple, well-understood economic order quantity, and hence is likely
to be more diﬃcult to implement. Fortunately, as we saw, the percentage penalty in the total of
replenishment, carrying, and shortage costs using the simpler sequential approach tends to be quite
small.† Thus, in most situations, we were justiﬁed in advocating its use for B items. However, even
small percentage savings may be attractive for A items. In the following sections, we present ﬁrst
the sequential approach, and then comment on, or present in detail, the simultaneous approach.
We now present rules for two diﬀerent shortage-costing measures for slow-moving items. In
Sections 8.1.1 and 8.1.2, we choose Q and s sequentially. In Section 8.1.3, we present simultaneous
selection of s and Q.
8.1.1 B2 Cost Measure for Very-Slow-Moving, Expensive Items (Q = 1)
As mentioned above, the discrete nature of the Poisson distribution causes problems in obtaining an
operational decision rule. For one important situation, namely, where the replenishment quantity
Q = 1, an analysis leads to a decision rule quite easy to implement.‡ First, let us see under what
conditions Q = 1 makes sense, for any distribution, including the Poisson. From Equation 4.3 of
Chapter 4, the total relevant costs, if an order quantity of size Q is used, are
TRC(Q) = Qvr/2 + AD/Q
We are indiﬀerent between Q = 1 and Q = 2 where
TRC(1) = TRC(2)
that is,
vr/2 + AD = vr + AD/2
or
D = vr/A
(8.3)
For any lower value of D, we prefer the use of Q = 1. Again note that this rule ignores shortage
costs and thus may lead to some errors. (See Problem 8.25.) To illustrate the rule, suppose that
A/r ≈13.11. Therefore, we have
Use Q = 1if
D < 0.0763v
* Natarajan and Goyal (1994) discuss many methods of setting safety stock and illustrate the interdependence of s
and Q.
† As noted in Chapter 4, Zheng (1992) shows that the fractional cost penalty of using the EOQ is always less than
1/8, and is usually much less. See also Axsäter (1996).
‡ When Q = 1, an (s, Q) policy is identical to an (S −1, S) policy because an order is placed to replace units sold
every time a demand occurs. See Moinzadeh (1989), Schultz (1990), and Moinzadeh and Schmidt (1991) for
additional work on this problem. The latter paper uses information about pipeline orders, which is available in
many cases due to supply chain integration and other technological developments.

8.1.1.1 Assumptions behind the Derivation of the Decision Rule
The assumptions include:
1. Continuous-review, order-point, order-quantity system with Q = 1. The remaining decision
variable is the order point, s, or the order-up-to level, S = s + 1.
2. Poisson demand. (The derivation in Section 8A.2 of the Appendix of this chapter does not
depend on Poisson demand, however, so that similar decision rules apply for any discrete
demand distribution.)
3. The replenishment lead time is a constant L time periods. (The results still hold if L has a
probability distribution as long as we use its mean value, E(L). However, the derivation is
considerably more complicated in this more general case.)
4. There is complete backordering of demands when out of stock. Karush (1957) and Mitchell
(1962) have investigated the case of complete lost sales; the results diﬀer very little from the
complete backordering situation. (See Rabinowitz et al. 1995 and Ouyang et al. 1996 for the
case of partial backorders.)
5. There is a ﬁxed cost, B2v, per unit backordered (i.e., a ﬁxed fraction, B2, of the unit value is
charged for each unit backordered).
8.1.1.2 Decision Rule
As shown in Section 8A.2 of the Appendix of this chapter, we are indiﬀerent between reorder points
s and s + 1 when
pp0(s + 1|ˆxL)
pp0≤(s|ˆxL)
=
r
DB2
(8.4)
where*
pp0(s + 1|ˆxL) = probability that a Poisson variable with mean ˆxL takes on the value s + 1
pp0≤(s|ˆxL) = probability that a Poisson variable with mean ˆxL takes on a value less than or
equal to s
and, as earlier,
r = carrying charge, in $/$/unit time
D = demand rate, in units/unit time
B2 = fraction of unit value charged per unit short
ˆxL = average (forecast) demand in a replenishment lead time
Equation 8.4 is developed by equating the total relevant cost function evaluated at s with the
same function evaluated at s + 1, and manipulating the resulting equation. (The left-hand side of
this equation is sometimes called the “reversed hazard rate,” the hazard rate being the ratio of the
probability density function to the complement of the cumulative density function.) Equation 8.4
can be implemented relatively quickly on a spreadsheet.

8.1.1.3 Numerical Illustration
Consider the case of a high-value item with
v = $350/unit
D = 25 units/year
r = 0.24 $/$/year
L = 3.5 weeks = 3.5/52 year
A = $3.20
and B2 is estimated to be 1/5 (i.e., 350/5 or $70 per unit backordered).
First, we can see from the sentence after Equation 8.3 that Q = 1. Now
r

0.24
25(1/5) = 0.048/unit
and
ˆxL = DL = 25

≈1.7units
The use of Equation 8.4 shows that the best order point is 4. That is, we order one-for-one each
time a demand drops the inventory position to 4. Another way of saying this is that the inventory
position should always be maintained at the level of 5.
8.1.1.4 Sensitivity to Value of B2
A precise value of B2 is not easy to ascertain. Fortunately, there is a range of B2 values for which
each s value holds. To illustrate, consider the item in the above numerical illustration. Assume that
D, r, and ˆxL are all known at the indicated values. Repeated use of Equation 8.4 identiﬁes the
following regions where each s value shown is best for the given value of ˆxL.

4
0.021–0.064
0.150–0.456
5
0.006–0.021
0.456–1.636
These results are striking. Note the wide ranges of B2 for which the same value of s is used. For
example, as long as B2 is anywhere between 0.150 and 0.456, the best s value is 4. Again, we see a
situation where the result is insensitive to the value of one of the parameters.
8.1.1.5 More General Case of Q > 1 and a B2 Cost Structure
This is still the case in which a fraction of the unit cost is charged per unit short and Q and s are
determined sequentially. The solution discussed above is only appropriate for Q = 1. When the
use of Equation 8.4 indicates that the best replenishment quantity is 2 or larger, we can no longer
obtain as convenient a solution, at least for the case of B2 (a fraction of the unit value charged per

356
■

unit short). An exact analysis (see Problem 8.25) leads to indiﬀerence between s and s + 1 where
the following condition holds:
Q
j=1 pp0(s + j|ˆxL)
pp0≤(s|ˆxL)
= Qr
DB2
(8.5)
where
pp0(x0|ˆxL) is the probability that a Poisson variable with mean ˆxL takes on the value x0
pp0≤(x0|ˆxL) is the probability that the same variable takes on a value less than or equal to x0
This equation is more challenging to develop on a spreadsheet. The use of another computer-
ized routine is more appropriate.
8.1.2 Case of Q ≥1 and a B1 Cost Structure
In some cases, it may be more appropriate to assume a ﬁxed cost B1 per (impending) stockout
occasion as opposed to a cost per unit short. For such a case, we have developed indiﬀerence curves
useful for selecting the appropriate reorder point. As shown in Section 8A.2 of the Appendix of
this chapter, we are indiﬀerent between s and s + 1 as reorder points when
pp0(s + 1|ˆxL)
pp0≤(s|ˆxL)
= Qvr
DB1
(8.6)
where all the variables have been deﬁned above. The indiﬀerence curves of Figure 8.1 are developed
by repeated calculation of Equation 8.6: for a given value of s and ˆxL, Equation 8.6 is solved for
Qvr/DB1. For a given value of s, this is repeated for a number of values of ˆxL to produce a curve
representing indiﬀerence between s and s+1 as a function of ˆxL and Qvr/DB1. These curves deﬁne
regions on a graph of Qvr/DB1 versus ˆxL where we prefer one s value to others.
For a given item, values of Q, v, r, D, and B1 are used to evaluate the quantity Qvr/DB1. The
point in Figure 8.1 corresponding to this quantity and the appropriate ˆxL indicates the best value
of the order point, s, to use.
8.1.3 Simultaneous Determination of s and Q for Slow-Moving Items
As noted above, the sequential approach of ﬁrst ﬁnding Q and then ﬁnding s can lead to higher
costs. For the case of Poisson demand and various shortage costs, there are eﬃcient methods for
ﬁnding s and Q simultaneously. In a groundbreaking study, Federgruen and Zheng (1992) provide
a very fast algorithm for both B2 and B3 shortage costs. (See also Gallego 1996.) An alternative is
to build the total cost equation on a spreadsheet and search (perhaps using a data table) for the
optimal values. Here, we simply present two total cost equations and refer to the relevant literature
for the algorithm. It will be clear from the cost equations that a spreadsheet will not be as eﬀective
as a routine written with a macro in a spreadsheet or in another computer programming language.

See Federgruen and Zheng (1992) for details. We have found that in spite of the speed of the
algorithm, and the fast computers available, many managers resist these more complex equations
and algorithms. Thus, we suggest that a test be done on a small sample of items to see if the
simultaneous solution is worth the added eﬀort.
8.2 Controlling the Inventories of Intermittent Demand Items
In Section 3.8.1, we argued for a special type of forecasting for this kind of item that speciﬁcally
separates out as two variables (1) the time (n) between demand transactions and (2) the sizes (z) of
the transactions. In particular, we advocated estimating ˆn (the average number of periods between
transactions), ˆz (the average size of a transaction), and MSE(z). Now, in selecting values of control
variables, such as s, we must take account of the intermittent nature of the demands; speciﬁcally,
there may now be a signiﬁcant chance of no demand at all during a lead time. Problem 8.29 deals
with the case of an (s, Q) system. When intermittent demand is known well ahead of time, it is

358
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
more appropriate to use a decision rule based on a deterministic, time-varying demand pattern
(see Chapter 5). Ekanayake and Norman (1977) discuss this type of issue in a case study context.
Scala et al. (2013) describe using a base-stock model with intermittent demand, and Teunter et
al. (2011) provide an adjustment for obsolescence in an intermittent demand setting. Bachman
et al. (2016) present an approach for managing highly variable items that has been eﬀectively
applied for the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency. See also Croston (1972) and Shenstone and Hynd-
man (2005). Related works include Silver (1970), Wilcox (1970), Cawdery (1976), Ward (1978),
Williams (1982, 1984), Alscher et al. (1986), Etienne (1987), Schultz (1987), Watson (1987), Yil-
maz (1992), Hollier et al. (1995), Johnston and Boylan (1996), Syntetos and Boylan (2001), and
Snyder et al. (2012).
8.3 Nature of C Items
The categorization of items for control purposes was ﬁrst discussed in Chapter 2. As a reminder,
we repeat some of the important points here.
The primary factor that indicates that an item should be placed in the C category is a low dollar
usage (Dv value). The exact cut-oﬀvalue between the B and C categories should be selected so that
somewhere on the order of 30%–50% of all the items are classiﬁed in the C category. A low Dv
value alone is not suﬃcient to dictate that an item should be placed in the C category, however.
The real requirement is that the annual total of replenishment, carrying, and shortage costs be
quite low under any reasonable control strategy. Normally, Dv is a useful surrogate for this total.
However, a low-dollar-usage item may have potentially severe shortage penalties associated with it.
Some typical examples come to mind:
1. A slow-moving product that rounds out a service line provided to an important customer.
Shortages on this item can cause severe reductions in the usage of several faster-moving items.
2. A product that is the “pride and joy” of the president because he or she was instrumental in
its development. In this case, there is a high implicit cost associated with a shortage.
3. An inexpensive product that has a high explicit shortage cost. The authors vividly remember
the case of an electronics manufacturer whose limited manufacturing area was clogged with
ﬁve expensive pieces of custom-made equipment, each the size of two large refrigerators,
because the company had once again run out of the plastic control knobs worth 7 cents each.
For a true C item, the low total of replenishment, carrying, and shortage costs implies that,
regardless of the type of control system used, we cannot achieve a sizable absolute savings in these
costs. Therefore, the guiding principle should be to use simple procedures that keep the control
costs per SKU quite low. That is, we wish to keep the labor and paperwork per item to a minimum.
Equipment that permits electronic capture of data at the point of sale clearly reduces control costs.
However, in our opinion, some organizations are overusing this capability. If the actual cost of
using the electronic system (including maintenance of the software and updating the inventory
records) is quite low, such a system could be a useful tool for C items.* Finally, we should be careful
in deﬁning C items because an item’s classiﬁcation can change over time. The classiﬁcation should
be reviewed periodically so that important items are not relegated to C item status.
* In spite of the widespread use of automated data collection systems and even the availability of spreadsheets for
computing inventory policies, a remarkable number of ﬁrms still operate relatively manually.

8.4 Control of C Items Having Steady Demand
In this section, we deal with items having a relatively low importance and a demand rate that is
not changing appreciably with time. Moreover, we assume that it makes sense to actually stock
the C items under consideration. In Section 8.7, we address the more fundamental question of
stocking an item versus making or buying it to each customer order.
8.4.1 Inventory Records
As a consequence of the primary objective mentioned above, in most cases, it may be most appro-
priate not to maintain any inventory record of a C item. It may be more desirable simply to rely on
an administrative mechanism for reordering, such as placing an order when the last box in a bin is
opened. If an inventory record is maintained, it should certainly not require that each transaction
be recorded (except for the possible use of electronic point-of-sale data capture). Instead, a rather
long review interval, such as 6 months, should be considered. Of course, for demand estimation
and order control purposes, a record should be kept of when orders were placed and received.
Stated another way, we are saying that there are two choices for selecting a review interval for a
C item:
1. Periodic review with a relatively long interval.
2. Continuous review but with a mechanism for triggering orders that requires neither a physical
stock count nor the manual updating (in a ledger) of the stock status. Examples are (i) a
two-bin system of control, and (ii) electronic capture of usage data.
8.4.2 Selecting the Reorder Quantity (or Reorder Interval)
Stated bluntly, the frills of the economic order quantity, Silver–Meal heuristic, and so on are com-
pletely unwarranted for Class C items. Instead, a simple oﬀshoot of the basic EOQ developed
in Chapter 4 should be used. Speciﬁcally, one of at most a few possible time supplies should be
assigned to each Class C item. The time supply to use should be based as much on shelf life and
obsolescence as on setup cost, unit cost, or carrying charge. It is usually reasonable to use a single
value of the ratio A/r for all C items. (One convenient way of estimating this value is through
the exchange curves of Chapter 4.) To illustrate, consider the following situation. The value of r is
found to be 0.24$/$/year and a reasonable average value of A is $3.20. Furthermore, for C items,
management has decided that only three possible time supplies—6, 12, and 18 months—are worth
considering. Using the approach suggested in Section 4.4 of Chapter 4, we develop the particularly
simple decision rule shown in Table 8.1. D would not be estimated through a forecasting system
but rather through knowledge of the starting and ending inventories over a convenient time period.
For example, the procedure could be as follows in a two-bin (s, Q) system. Consider two consecu-
tive orders A and B. Let A be received at time tA and B be placed at time tB. Let IA be the inventory
level just before A is received (a typically low level, hence easy to count). Then we have
Demand rate ≈IA + Q −s
tB −tA
(8.9)
Of course, if pilferage losses are signiﬁcant, we would have an overly high estimate of the
demand rate. Needless to say, rather than taking account of these losses, the preferable approach is
to reduce the losses themselves.

8.4.3 Selecting the Reorder Point (or Order-Up-to Level)
Any of the criteria discussed in Chapter 6 could be chosen for selecting the safety factor. (And with
spreadsheets, the safety factors can be found easily.) However, we advocate the use of a speciﬁc crite-
rion: select the safety factor to provide a speciﬁed expected time, TBS, between stockout occasions.
We have found this criterion to be particularly appealing to management in most C item contexts.
It appears to be a method that managers are comfortable with for expressing their risk aversion.
Thinking in terms of an average time between stockouts is apparently more straightforward than
dealing with probabilities or fractions. Quite often, many C items are involved in a single customer
order. Therefore, to assure a reasonable chance of satisfying the complete customer order, a very
high level of service must be used for each C item. Thus, large values of TBS (e.g., 5–100 years) are
not unreasonable when we recognize the small added expense of carrying a high safety stock. The
decision rule for the TBS criterion (see Section 6.7.11 of Chapter 6) is to select the safety factor k
to satisfy*
pu≥(k) =
Q
D(TBS)
(8.10)
where
pu≥(k) = Pr{Unit normal variable (mean 0, standard deviation 1) takes on a value of k or larger}
is a widely tabulated function (see Table II.1 in Appendix II) and is a built-in function in many
spreadsheets. (See Appendix III.) Then we set the reorder point†
s = ˆxL + kσL
(8.11)
where‡
ˆxL = DL
(8.12)
* In Equation 8.10, a negative k results if Q/D(TBS) > 0.5. This is very unlikely to occur if TBS is large, as
suggested earlier. In any event, management should specify a minimum allowable value of k.
† If a periodic review, order-up-to-level (R, S) system is to be used, then throughout this section, the decision rules
should be modiﬁed as follows (see Section 6.9):
1. Replace L by R + L
2. Replace Q/D by R
3. Replace s by S
‡ Note that ˆxL is not an output of the forecast system (as mentioned earlier, we are advocating not forecasting
C items). D is estimated as discussed in the preceding subsection.

Managing Slow-Moving and Low-Value (Class C) Inventories

is the expected demand (in units) in the replenishment lead time of length L (years), and σL is
the estimate of the standard deviation (in units) of forecast errors over L. (We return shortly to a
discussion of how σL is estimated.)
The appropriate question at this point is: “Who needs all this aggravation, especially for C
items?” Equation 8.10 holds for general values of Q/D and TBS. In the context of any company,
only a few values of each of these two parameters would be speciﬁed. For these few combinations,
the equations could be used once and for all to develop a simple table. We illustrate this in Table
8.2, when demand is normally distributed for a sample ﬁrm, using the earlier selected Q/D values
of 6, 12, and 18 months, and also management-speciﬁed values of 10, 20, and 50 years for TBS.
Once k is selected, the reorder point follows from Equation 8.11. However, for this purpose,
an estimate of σL is required. One point is certain: σL should not be developed from observing
forecast errors of the speciﬁc C item under consideration. Instead, we suggest the use of the Poisson
distribution for developing an estimate of σL because it typically applies to slow-moving items. This
approach provides quick estimates of σL even though it may not be exact.
For the Poisson distribution (see Equation 8A.1), we have the simple relation, which again will
only approximate the true standard deviation, and therefore safety stock,* if demand is not Poisson
σL =

ˆxL =
√
DL units
(8.13)
Finally, we note that it may be a good idea to keep a record of stockouts to see if the speciﬁed
TBS is being met.
8.4.3.1 Numerical Illustration
Consider an item that is a slow-moving with D = 48 units/year, L = 2 months, an order quantity
time supply of 12 months, and a speciﬁed TBS of 20 years.
ˆxL = DL = 48 units/year × 1/6 year = 8 units
From Table 8.2, we read that the safety factor k should be set at 1.64. Suppose we make the
Poisson assumption. Then Equation 8.13 gives
σL ≈
√
8 = 2.83 units
From Equation 8.11 we have that the reorder point is
s = 8 + 1.64(2.83) = 12.6, say 13 units
8.4.4 Two-Bin System Revisited
In Section 6.4 of Chapter 6, we described a particularly simple physical form of an (s, Q) system—
the two-bin system. To review, in a two-bin system, the on-hand inventory is segregated into two
distinct sections (generically called bins). The capacity of one of the bins (called the reserve bin) is
set equal to the reorder point. Demands are satisﬁed from the other bin until its stock is depleted.
* Alternatively, the estimating technique in Section 3.8.1 of Chapter 3 may be used.

Opening the reserve bin is a signal to place a replenishment order. When the order arrives, the
reserve bin is reﬁlled and sealed. The remainder of the order is placed in the other bin.
The authors have seen some rather clever forms of the bins concept. Examples include: (i) the
use of “baggies" in the case of small electronic components, and (ii) color coding the end of an
appropriate bar in steel stacked in a distribution warehouse.
To facilitate ordering, a bin reserve tag should be attached to the reserve bin so that when this
bin is opened, the clerk will have the tag to remind him/her to report that the bin was opened. In
fact, in many cases, the tag itself can be used as an order form. At the very least, dates and order
quantities can be recorded on it (permitting an estimate of D when it is needed).
Obviously, for satisfactory performance of this system, it is imperative that a tag be promptly
submitted to purchasing (or production scheduling) whenever a reserve bin is opened. Supervisors,
assemblers, sales personnel, and others must be motivated to follow this procedure while they
meet their own objectives in the rush of daily activities. One approach to maintaining this level of
discipline is known as plan for every part (PFEP), where the movement of each part is recorded in
one database. See Harris (2004) for more detail on PFEP.
8.4.5 Simple Form of the (R, S) System
Smith (1984) reports on the implementation of a simple form of the (R, S) system, known as
the semiautomatic stock control system, that is particularly eﬀective for control of C (as well as
B) items in a retail environment. Here is how it operates for any particular item, illustrated for a
weekly review interval and a lead time less than R.
Periodically (likely less often than every review period, for example, each quarter-year),
management speciﬁes a desired value of S and at only that time the on-hand stock is counted
and an order is placed to raise the inventory position to S. That is, the on-hand plus the order
quantity must equal S. Then, at each regular review instant (here each week), the computer simply
orders enough to replace sales since the last review. Therefore, the only record that must be main-
tained is the total sales in the current review interval. Problem 8.3 deals with how a desired increase
or decrease in S would be implemented.
8.4.5.1 Numerical Illustration
Consider an item where the desired value of S is 35 units and a physical stock count reveals that
the on-hand inventory is 26 units (with nothing on order). Then an order for 9 units would be
placed. Suppose that the sales prior to the next review (ordering time) were 12 units. As a result,
the next order would simply be for 12 units.

8.4.6 Grouping of Items
In some cases, it may be advantageous to group C items for control purposes. In particular, if a
group of items (including some from the A and B categories) are provided by the same supplier,
or produced in-house on the same equipment, then coordinated control (to be discussed in Chap-
ter 10) may very well be in order to reduce replenishment costs. That is, when one item in the
group needs reordering, several others should likely be included in the order. This is particularly
appealing for a C item. By including it in an order initiated by another item, we avoid incurring a
full setup cost (A) for its replenishment.
Coordination does not rule out the use of a two-bin system of control for the individual C
item. Instead, reserve tags of opened reserve bins are held centrally between designated periodic
times at which that group is ordered. Of course, the reserve stock must be appropriately scaled up
to provide protection over a length of time equal to the sum of the periodic ordering interval plus
the replenishment lead time.
8.5 Control of Items with Declining Demand Patterns
In this section, we deal with items nearing the end of their usage lifetimes (the end of the product
life cycle that was discussed in Section 2.5 of Chapter 2). These ideas, however, are applicable
beyond just C items. In particular, high-unit-value service parts (i.e., B and A items) eventually
enter a period of declining requirements when the parent population is phased out.*
8.5.1 Establishing the Timing and Sizes of Replenishments under
Deterministic Demand
Brosseau (1982) studied the special, but important, case where the (instantaneous) demand rate is
dropping linearly with time. The demand pattern therefore is
xt = a −bt
(8.14)
where t is time, and a and b are constants. For example, let a = 10, b = 2, and let t be measured
in weeks. Then the demand rate at the end of week 1 is projected to be 10 −2(1) = 8, and will
be zero at the end of week 5. The total remaining requirements are a2/2b (or 25 in the example).
The optimal strategy turns out to be a function of only a single parameter, M, which is given by
M = Ab2
vra3
(8.15)
Note that M gets larger as a/b decreases—that is, as we get closer to the end of the demand
pattern.
Brosseau ascertains as a function of M (1) how many replenishments to make and (2) the
timing of the replenishments (as fractions of the horizon a/b). These results are shown in the form
of a simple table. More importantly, however, he shows that a very simple procedure, based again
on the EOQ, produces negligible cost penalties. Speciﬁcally, use the basic EOQ, based on the
* The case of increasing demand was addressed in Chapters 5 and 7.

current demand rate and expressed as a time supply, as long as M < 0.075, and use a single last
replenishment equal to the total remaining requirements (a2/2b) when M ≥0.075. The cutoﬀ
value of 0.075 turns out to be approximately the value of M where we are indiﬀerent between 1
and 2 replenishments in the optimal solution. (See Problem 8.12.)
Smith (1977) and Brown (1977) found similar results for other types of declining demand
patterns (including a continuous analog of the geometric pattern described in Section 3.8.4 of
Chapter 3)—namely, that use of the EOQ, until it implies an order quantity almost as large as the
total remaining requirements, produces excellent results.
We operationalize these results by suggesting the use of the EOQ as long as the total remaining
requirements are at least 1.3 EOQ. If not, simply use one last replenishment to cover the remaining
requirements. It can be shown that the 1.3 factor is equivalent to Brosseau’s cutoﬀM value for the
case of linearly decreasing demand.
For further research on this topic, see Chakravarty and Martin (1989), who addressed the case
of exponentially decreasing demand and price reductions. Wee (1995) developed an exact solution
to the problem of ﬁnding a replenishment policy for an item that faces declining demand, and
that deteriorates over time. See also Kicks and Donaldson (1980), Hariga (1994), Ting and Chung
(1994), Hariga (1995), Bose et al. (1995), and Chapter 9.
8.5.2 Sizing of the Final Replenishment under Probabilistic Demand
When demand is declining, but probabilistic in nature, the choice of the size of one last replen-
ishment involves a trade-oﬀbetween (1) the costs of insuﬃcient inventory (reordering, expediting,
shortages, etc.) if the total remaining demand exceeds the inventory position after the order is
placed, and (2) the costs of overacquisition if the total remaining demand is less than the inventory
position. Again, the ﬁrst category of costs is typically very diﬃcult to establish. So management
may resort to the use of a desired service level, which, in turn, is likely to be largely dictated by
industry norms (e.g., meeting 95% of all requests for spare parts during a 10-year period after the
last sale of a new unit). We present a decision rule based on satisfying a certain fraction of the
remaining demand. The derivation is outlined in Section 8A.3 of the Appendix of this chapter.
Fortuin (1980) treated other service measures. See also Cattani and Souza (2003) and Pourakbar
et al. (2012, 2014).
8.5.2.1 Decision Rule
Select the order-up-to-level* S where
S = ˆy + kσy
(8.16)
with ˆy being the forecasted total remaining demand,† and σy the standard deviation of the total
remaining demand. (One way to estimate σy would be to use the procedure of Brown (1981),
* S = (current inventory position) + (order quantity).

referenced in Section 3.8.2 of Chapter 3.) The safety factor k satisﬁes
Gu(k) = ˆy(1 −P2)
σy
(8.19)
where Gu(k) is again the special function of the unit normal distribution tabulated in Table II.1 of
Appendix II, and given for spreadsheets in Appendix III.
8.5.2.2 Numerical Illustration
An automotive manufacturer is concerned with the size of the last replenishment of a spare part
for a particular make of automobile that was discontinued 3 years ago. A ﬁt to recent historical
monthly usage indicates that a geometrically decaying pattern is appropriate with
ˆy = 83.1 units
σy = 16.8 units
Suppose that it is management’s decision to select an S value for the last replenishments such
that management expects 95% of the remaining demand for the spare part to be met by S. This
does not mean that the other 5% would be lost; instead, cost-incurring actions, such as parts
conversion, may be taken to satisfy the remaining demand, or the customer (or service department
at the dealer) would seek a third-party/aftermarket part.
By using Equation 8.19 , we obtain
Gu(k) = 83.1
16.8(1 −0.95) = 0.2473
Then, from Table II.1 of Appendix II,
k ≈0.35
Hence, from Equation 8.16
S = 83.1 + 0.35(16.8)
≈89 units
8.6 Reducing Excess Inventories
When studying the inventories of many companies, it is common to ﬁnd a signiﬁcant percentage
of the stocked items that have had absolutely no sales (or internal usage) in the last one or more
we have, from Equation 3.79 of Chapter 3,
ˆy =
fa

(8.18)

■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
years. In some industries, the percentage of stocked items that have had no usage in the previous
52 weeks can be as high as 47 %. We refer to these SKUs as dead items.*
Of course, any remaining stock of a dead item is, by deﬁnition, excess stock. In addition, there
are often many slow-moving items for which stock levels are excessive. The reasons for excess inven-
tories can be grouped into two categories. First are errors associated with replenishments, that is,
having purchased or produced too much of an item. These include production overruns, unjusti-
ﬁed quantity purchases, errors in the transmission of an order request (e.g., 1,000 units instead of a
desired 100 units), and inaccurate inventory records (e.g., location errors and “hoarding" of parts).
The second class of reasons relates to overestimating the demand rate. Included here are inaccurate
forecasts, deliberate changes in sales/marketing eﬀorts, technological obsolescence (such as through
an engineering change), and customer cancellations.
Whatever the causes of excess stocks, it is important to be able to (1) identify the associated
items and (2) decide on what remedial action to take. Ideally, it would be desirable to be able to
anticipate the decrease in usage of an item and take appropriate action to avoid being caught with a
large surplus stock. It should be noted that this general problem area is increasing in importance as
the rate of technological change increases, causing the life cycle of the typical product to shorten.
8.6.1 Review of the Distribution by Value
Again, we make use of a simple, but powerful, tool of analysis, the distribution by value (DBV)
list. Recall from an earlier discussion (Table 2.1 in Chapter 2) if that the DBV is a listing of items
in decreasing order of annual dollar usage (Dv value). At the bottom of the table listing will be
all of the items that had no sales (or internal usage) over the period from which D was estimated
(normally the most recent full year). Furthermore, moving up the table, we immediately encounter
the items that have had very low usage.
To establish the DBV, values of Di and vi are required for each item i. If, at the same time, a
reading on the inventory level Ii of item i can be obtained, then a very useful additional table can
be developed as follows.
For each item, the expected time at which the current stock level will be depleted, also called
the coverage or runout time, is computed by the formula
CO = 12I
D
(8.20)
where
CO = coverage, in months
I = on-hand inventory, in units
D = expected usage rate, in units/year
The items are shown in Table 8.3 in decreasing order of coverage. Also shown is the inven-
tory (in dollars) of each item and the cumulative percentage of the total inventory as one proceeds
down the table. In Table 8.3 (involving a population of 200 items with a total inventory valued
at $7,863), we can see that 4.2% of the total inventory is tied up in stock of zero-movers and
* Occasionally, items are kept in inventory to be used as parts for other products. These items never sell as is, but
they are vital to the overall service performance. Clearly, these items should be stocked.

some 6.9% is included in items having a coverage of 5 years (60 months) or more. Such informa-
tion would be of use to management in deciding how serious the overstock situation is and what
remedial action to take.*
Individual item usage values (Di’s) are needed to construct the distribution by value table.
Where these are not readily available, a practical alternative is to simply tour the storage facilities,
applying a so-called dust test: any stock that looks overly dusty (or its equivalent) is a candidate for
identiﬁcation as a dead or very-slow-moving item.
8.6.2 Rule for the Disposal Decision
By disposing of some stock, we now achieve beneﬁts of salvage revenue (possibly negative) and
reduced inventory carrying costs. On the other hand, we will have to replenish at an earlier time
than if no stock disposal was made. With regard to inventory carrying costs, it should be recognized
that often the most costly aspect of excess inventory is that it is taking up signiﬁcant space in a
storage area of limited capacity. In addition, there is often a nuisance cost associated with stock that
has physically deteriorated. Examples include the presence of rats and vermin, excessive rusting, and
so forth. The authors recall the case of manufactured, large, metal piping that was stored in an open
yard. One particular item, left standing for a number of years, had slowly sunk into the mud with
each spring thaw until it stabilized in a semisubmerged state. High-cost excavation equipment was
required to remove the dead stock in order to free up the space it was occupying. In this subsection,
we present two approaches to this disposal decision, one that assumes deterministic demand, and
one that assumes probabilistic demand.
8.6.2.1 Deterministic Demand
The derivation, presented in Section 8A.4 of the Appendix of this chapter, is based on a determin-
istic level demand pattern. Alternative decision rules could be developed (1) for a declining, but
still deterministic, demand pattern, or (2) for probabilistic demand; the latter case closely parallels
the selection of S for the terminal replenishment (see Section 8.5.2).
Let W be the amount of stock to dispose. Then W is given by
W = I −EOQ −D(v −g)
vr
(8.21)
where I is the current inventory level of the item,
EOQ =

2AD
vr
as earlier, and g is the unit salvage value (g can be negative if there is a net cost per unit associated
with disposing of stock). Note that when v = g, that is, the salvage value is equal to the full unit
variable cost, Equation 8.21 says that I −W (which is the amount to leave in stock) is equal to the
EOQ. That is, when we get our full money back, we dispose of stock so that on-hand inventory
will just equal the EOQ. (See also Problem 8.10.)
* We worked with one ﬁrm in which nearly 1,000 of the 3,600 items in the ﬁrm’s inventory sold so infrequently
that management was aggressively working to eliminate them altogether.

Managing Slow-Moving and Low-Value (Class C) Inventories

8.6.2.2 Numerical Illustration
The manager of the hardware division of a retail outlet has discovered that the stock level of a
particular item is 1,200 units, not 200 units as he had expected. Thus, he feels that some of the
stock should be disposed of by means of a sale at 2/3 of unit cost (i.e., g = (2/3)v). He estimates
the following values for other characteristics of the item:
D = 400 units/year
A = $20
v = $3.00/unit
r = 0.25 $/$/year
Equation 8.21 implies that the disposal amount should be
W = 1,200 −

2(20)(400)
(3.00)(0.25) −400(3.00 −2.00)
(3.00)(0.25)
= 521 units
8.6.2.3 Probabilistic Demand
The second approach due to Rosenﬁeld (1989) focuses on the number of units to be saved (not
disposed of) and initially assumes that demands arrive according to a Poisson process and no further
replenishments are to be made. If there is one unit demanded per arrival, a simple formula ﬁnds
the optimal number of units to be saved. Find the largest integer less than
log((Vc + a/i)/(Vu + a/i))/log(D/D + i)
(8.22)
where
Vc = the salvage value at the present time as a percentage of the current value
Vu = the ultimate salvage value as a percentage of the current value
i = discount rate
a = carrying charge excluding capital holding costs, as a percentage of the current value
D = average demand per year.
8.6.2.4 Numerical Illustration
Consider an item with the following characteristics:
Vc = 0.5, Vu = 0.7, i = 0.12, a = 0.09, D = 20
Find the optimal number of units to save in inventory, if there is always one unit
demanded per customer arrival, and demands arrive according to a Poisson process. The use of
Equation 8.22 gives
log((Vc + a/i)/(Vu + a/i))/log(D/D + i)
= log((0.5 + 0.09/0.12)/(0.7 + 0.09/0.12))/log(20/20 + 0.12) = 24.81

370
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
So the ﬁrm should save 24 units. If current inventory is 50 units, they should dispose of 26
units.
Rosenﬁeld also develops formulas for several more complex cases, including items that are
perishable. For example, if the batch size distribution is geometric with parameter q, a simple
formula is given:
Find the largest integer less than
log((Vc + a/i)/(Vu + a/i))
log(qD/(D + i) + (1 −q))
For a geometric distribution, the probability of a batch size of y is q(1 −q)y−1, and the mean
batch size is 1/q. The variance of the batch size is (1 −q)/q2.
8.6.3 Options for Disposing of Excess Stock
Possible courses of action for disposing of excess stock include the following:
1. Use for other purposes. For example, in the case of components or raw materials, consider their
use, possibly requiring some rework, in diﬀerent ﬁnal products.
2. Shipment of the material to another location. Where an item is stocked at more than one
location, it may have negligible demand at one location but still experience a signiﬁcant
demand elsewhere. The transfer of stock not only frees up space at the “ﬁrst” location, but
it also helps avoid the costly setup (or acquisition) costs associated with satisfying the likely
infrequent demands at the other location(s).
3. Use of stock for promotional purposes. Excess stock may be converted to a revenue generator
by providing free samples of it when customers purchase other products. For example, an
appliance store with an overstock of an inexpensive table lamp might oﬀer it free as a bonus
to each customer buying a television set. The extreme case of this action is donating the stock
to some charitable cause.
4. Mark-downs or special sales. The unit price is reduced suﬃciently to generate appreciable
demand for the product. An example would be the reduced price of wrapping paper or
decorations immediately following the Christmas season.
5. Returns to suppliers at a unit value likely lower than the initial acquisition cost. A good example
is that of a college bookstore returning extra copies of a book to the publishing company’s
distributor.
6. Auctions. These should not be overlooked as a possible means of salvaging some value from
excess stock.
7. Disposal for scrap value. The best course of action may be to sell the material directly to a scrap
dealer, a common transaction when there is a signiﬁcant metallic component of the item.
Internal uses of the inventory (numbers 1 and 2) often provide better return than trying to
move the inventory on the external market. Whatever course of action is selected, the excess stock
will not disappear overnight. Therefore, it is important to lay out an approximate timetable for
disposal, and then to ensure that there is appropriate follow-up. Also note that whenever inventory
is disposed of and generates revenue that is less than the acquisition cost, there is an eﬀect on the
ﬁrm’s income statement. Operating proﬁt may decrease because of the loss taken on the inventory.

Managing Slow-Moving and Low-Value (Class C) Inventories

371
Thus, income taxes may decrease, and cash ﬂow may improve. These eﬀects should be examined
closely. (See Smith 1987.)
8.7 Stocking versus Not Stocking an Item
Many items with extremely low sales may be minor variations of faster-moving products. In such
a case, it can be attractive to eliminate the slow-moving special versions. Of course, decisions of
this type, as well as those where there is no substitute product, go beyond the area of production
planning and inventory management. Marketing considerations, including customer relations, are
obviously relevant. For example, the slow mover may be carried as a service item for an important
customer. Furthermore, the appropriate course of action may not be to discontinue selling the
item, but rather to make or buy it to order as opposed to stocking it, an issue addressed in the
following material.
Given that we have decided to satisfy customer demands for a given SKU, the question we
now face is: Should we make a special purchase from the supplier (or production run) to satisfy each
customer-demand transaction or should we purchase (or produce) to stock? It should be emphasized
that this question is not restricted to C items. As we will see, a low demand rate tends to favor
nonstocking, but there are a number of other factors that also inﬂuence the decision.
Earlier in the book, we have seen that, given that an item is stocked, its total relevant costs per
year are quite insensitive to the precise settings of the control variables (e.g., the reorder point and
the order quantity). Interestingly enough, more substantial savings can often be achieved through
the appropriate answer to the question of whether or not the item should even be stocked.
8.7.1 Relevant Factors
For simplicity, our discussion is in terms of a purchased item, but the concepts are readily adaptable
to in-house production. There are a number of factors that can inﬂuence the decision to stock or
not stock the item. These include:
1. The system cost (ﬁle maintenance, forecasting, etc.) per unit time of stocking an item.
2. The unit variable cost of the item both when it is bought for stock and when it is purchased
to meet each demand transaction. A more favorable price may be achieved by the regular
larger buys associated with stocking. In addition, a premium per unit may be necessary if the
nonstocking purchases are made from a competitor.
3. The cost of a temporary backorder associated with each demand when the item is not stocked.
4. The ﬁxed setup cost associated with a replenishment in each context. An account should be
taken of possible coordination with other items, because setup costs may be reduced.
5. The carrying charge (including the eﬀects of obsolescence) which, together with the unit
variable cost, determines the cost of carrying each unit of inventory per unit time.
6. The frequency and magnitude of demand transactions.
7. The replenishment lead time.
Often, it is best to avoid stocking an item at a given location if there is an internal supplier
(a central warehouse, for example) that can hold inventory for several locations. Of course, it is
important to examine the replenishment lead time and ascertain that customers are willing to wait

372
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
the additional transportation time. If not, the cost of a temporary shortage should be included in
the analysis. In what follows, we assume that the replenishment lead time is quite short.
8.7.2 Simple Decision Rule
A general model to handle all of the above factors would be of limited value to the typical practi-
tioner because of its complexity. Therefore, in this subsection, we present a simple rule (based on
work by Popp 1965), valid under speciﬁc assumptions. Even when these assumptions are violated,
the rule should still be a useful guideline. In any event, in the next subsection, some extensions will
be discussed.*
8.7.2.1 Assumptions
1. The unit variable cost is the same under stocking and nonstocking.
2. The ﬁxed setup cost is the same under stocking and nonstocking.
3. In deriving the decision rule to decide on whether or not to stock the item, we allow the
order quantity to be a noninteger. Of course, if the item was actually stocked and demands
were in integer units, we would use an integer value for the order quantity.
4. The replenishment lead time is negligible; consequently, there is no backordering cost.
Based on comparing the cost of not stocking with the cost of stocking, we establish the
following decision rule†:
8.7.2.2 The Decision Rule
Do not stock the item if either of the following two conditions holds (otherwise stock the item):
cs > A/E(i)
(8.23)
or
E(t)vr > E(i)
2A
 A
E(i) −cs
2
(8.24)
where
cs = system cost, in dollars per unit time, of having the item stocked
A = ﬁxed setup cost, in dollars, associated with a replenishment
E(i) = expected (or average) interval (or time) between demand transactions
E(t) = expected (or average) size of a demand transaction in units
v = unit variable cost of the item, in $/unit
r = carrying charge, in $/$/unit time
If the decision is to stock the item, then the economic order quantity should be used.
EOQ =

2AD
vr
(8.25)
* Valadares Tavares and Tadeu Almeida (1983) have presented an even simpler decision rule under somewhat more
restrictive assumptions (Poisson demand and a choice solely between stocking 1 unit versus no stocking).
† The derivation of this rule is given in Section 8A.5 of the Appendix of this chapter.

Managing Slow-Moving and Low-Value (Class C) Inventories
■
373
where
D = E(t)/E(i)
(8.26)
is the demand rate, in units per unit time.
The behavior of the rule as a function of the factors involved makes intuitive sense. As the setup
cost A goes up, we tend to stock the item. Likewise, as the expected time between transactions
decreases, we prefer to stock the item. As v or r increases, we tend not to stock because it becomes
too expensive to carry the item in inventory. As cs increases, we are less likely to prefer stocking the
item. Finally, the larger the expected transaction size E(t), the less likely we are to stock the item
because the individual special orders satisfy a relatively large demand.
8.7.2.3 Numerical Illustration
A ﬁrm has been purchasing a specialty item PDF-088 from a competitor each time that a customer
demand has been encountered. The manager of purchasing feels that it would be attractive to make
less frequent, larger purchases. Relevant parameter values have been estimated as follows:
v = $4.70/roll
E(t) = 1.4 rolls
E(i) = 10 weeks or 10/52 year
A = $2.50
r = 0.24 $/$/year
cs = 0.20 $/year
We have
E(t)vr = (1.4)(4.70)(0.24) = 1.58 $/year
A/E(i) = 2.50/10/52 = 13.00 $/year
The use of Equations 8.22 and 8.23 reveals that the item should indeed be purchased for stock,
with the best order quantity being 6 rolls.
8.7.3 Some Extensions
It is rather straightforward (see Problem 8.6) to generalize the decision rule of the previous subsec-
tion to allow the unit variable cost and the ﬁxed setup cost to each depend on whether or not the
item is purchased for stock. In place of Equations 8.23 and 8.24, we can develop the following:
Do not stock the item if either of the following conditions holds (otherwise stock the item):
cs > Ans
E(i) + E(t)
E(i)(vns −vs)
(8.27)
or
E(t)vsr > E(i)
2As
 Ans
E(i) + E(t)
E(i)(vns −vs) −cs

(8.28)

374
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
where
vs = unit variable cost, in $/unit, if the item is stocked
vns = unit variable cost, in $/unit, if the item is not stocked
As = ﬁxed setup cost, in dollars, if the item is stocked
Ans = ﬁxed setup cost, in dollars, if the item is not stocked (the cost of backordering and extra
paperwork would be included in Ans)
and all the other variables are as deﬁned after Equations 8.22 and 8.23.
Croston (1974) developed a decision rule for the case of a periodic review order-up-to-level
(R, S) system. His model assumes a negligible replenishment lead time, at most one demand trans-
action in each review interval, and a normal distribution of transaction sizes. Shorrock (1978)
developed a tabular aid for the stock/no stock decision.
It should be emphasized that the two quantities, E(t) and E(i), needed in Equa-
tions 8.23 and 8.24 or Equations 8.27 and 8.28 would be estimated from rather sparse data because
the items we are considering are slow-moving. The statistical ﬂuctuations of such limited data could
cause an item, whose underlying parameters had really not changed, to pass the stocking test 1 year
and fail it in the next. Johnson (1962) proposed the useful idea of two threshold values, one to
discontinue stocking an item, the other to institute stocking. The intermediate area helps prevent
an item from ﬂipping back and forth between stocking and nonstocking.
8.8 Summary
In this chapter, we have discussed procedures for controlling the inventories of the large number of
items with low annual dollar usage as well as important items that are slow-moving. For low-value
items, simplicity of control was stressed because of the low annual total of replenishment, carrying,
and shortage costs associated with such items. In other words, if the total of replenishment, carry-
ing, and shortage costs for an item is just a few dollars per year, we must use a control system for
that item that costs only pennies per year.
A ﬁnal point worth mentioning is that with C items, in particular, the best method of control
may be ascertained from the warehouse or production supervisor who knows, for example, that a
lot size of 10 units ﬁts conveniently into a storage bin or into the usual production schedule. Using
a decision rule that provides a diﬀerent quantity, with a trivial annual diﬀerence in costs, is hardly
worth the risk of alienating the supervisor.
Problems
8.1
Consider an item with the following characteristics:
v = $0.40/unit
D = 50 units/year
L = 3 months
In establishing a value of σ, it is reasonable to assume that demand for the item is adequately
approximated by a Poisson process. For an (s, Q) control system
a. Find the appropriate Q value using Table 8.1.
b. Find the s value assuming a desired TBS of 20 years and using Table 8.2.

The Fly-by-Night airlines has been phasing out one of the older types of aircraft that has
been a mainstay of its illustrious ﬂeet. Consequently, it has been observed that the associated
usage of a glue used for maintenance of this type of aircraft has been “dropping oﬀ” linearly
with time. The current level and trend of usage are estimated to be 110 liters/year and minus
45 liters/year/year. Other characteristics of the glue include A = $25, v = $4.50/liter, and
r = 0.3 $/$/year.
a. If it is now time to replenish (i.e., there is no inventory left), what order quantity should
be used?
b. If the usage rate continues to drop oﬀat the same linear rate, what should be the size of
the next replenishment?

Dr. Hunsen Bunnydew of Puppet Laboratories, Inc. had asked his assistant Test Tube to
order in some beakers. Poor Test Tube made a mistake in placing the order, and the lab now
has a 20-year supply! Hunsen has informed Test Tube that he must dispose of an appropriate
number of beakers. Test Tube’s friend, Zongo, has arranged for another medical laboratory
to purchase any quantity that Puppet oﬀers, but at $0.50/beaker, which is 1/3 of what Test
Tube paid for each of them. Using the following information, come to Test Tube’s aid by
suggesting an appropriate amount to sell oﬀ.

A C item is often purchased from the same supplier as a B or A item. Suppose that such is
the case and, based on an EOQ analysis for the B (or A) item involved, an order is placed for
the B (or A) item every 2 months. Assume that demand for the C item is essentially constant
with time at a rate of 18 units/year. Assume that the item has a unit value of $3/unit. The
additional ﬁxed cost of including the C item in an order of the B (or A) item is $1.20.
The carrying charge is 0.24$/$/year. It is reasonable to restrict attention to ordering the
C item in a quantity that will last for 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and so on (i.e.,
an integer multiple of the time supply of the other item). Which of these time supplies is
preferred?

Suppose you have been hired as an inventory control consultant by a client having thou-

two types of control. Using whatever symbols you feel are appropriate, develop as simple
a decision rule as possible for deciding on which type of control to use for each speciﬁc
item.

b. Suppose the ﬁxed cost per replenishment is $50, the unit variable cost is $0.80/unit,
and the carrying charge is 0.20 $/$/year. Use Brosseau’s method to establish the timing

Consider a company with A = $4.00, r = 0.30$/$/year, and cost of stocking cs =
$0.50/year. There are two items (X and Y ) having the same annual demand rate, D = 10
units/year and unit value v = $6.00/unit. However, the transactions for item X tend to be
larger than those for item Y , namely, the average transaction size for X is 5 units while that
for Y is only 2 units.
a. Show, using Section 8.7, that X should not be stocked and Y should be stocked.
b. Why are the decisions diﬀerent for the two items?
8.17
A company, attempting to remove slow movers from its line of stocked items, proposes
the following types of rules for deciding on whether or not to stock an item. If an item
is currently being stocked and no demands have been observed in the last T years, then
the item should not be stocked any longer. On the other hand, if the item is not currently
being stocked, we should begin stocking it if a total demand of at least m units is observed
in a 1-year period. The quantities T and m are control variables. There is a ﬁxed cost c1
associated with activating the stocking of an item (preparation of a new form, etc.). Suppose
that it is reasonable to assume that demand for an item is Poisson distributed with rate D
(where D is not really known with certainty).
a. For a given value of D, what is the probability that a currently stocked item will be
removed from the ﬁles precisely T years after a particular demand transaction? Develop
a graph of T values, as a function of D, that ensure a probability of 0.90.
b. Consider an item that has been removed from routine stocking at a time t. For a given
value of D, express the probability of activating the item in the very next year (following
t) as a function of m.

Because of the industrious nature of the faculty members involved, the Department of
Management Sciences at a well-known university consumes a large amount of 81/2 × 11

following procedure: Once a week (at 5 p.m. on Friday), she reviews the stock level. If there
are 20 or fewer pads, she orders 100 additional pads, which always arrive late on the next
Tuesday. If there are more than 20 pads on the shelf, she does nothing until at least the next
Friday. Assume that the faculty’s needs follow a Poisson distribution with the following rates

A maker of venetian blinds builds a wide variety of products. Demand tends to be erratic
and is diﬃcult to forecast. Each order of a particular blind requires a set of components
with some of the components (e.g., cords) being common to many ﬁnished items. The
company’s policy is to satisfy any customer order within 1 week. The actual time dedicated
to the satisfaction of an order, including some design work and retrieving the required set of
components from inventory, varies between 1 and 3 days. Inventory records are not updated
on a perpetual basis but rather the inventories of items are physically reviewed periodically
(with R varying from 2 weeks to 5 weeks, depending upon the item). An order-up-to level
is used for each component. Make some realistic suggestions for improving the inventory
management situation in this company.

The Acme Company stocks an item where the demand (x) during the lead time has the
following probability distribution:
Pr(x = 0) = 0.2
is normal with mean 40 units and standard deviation 8 units. In other words, nonzero
demands are normally distributed.
a. If an (s, Q) system of control is used with Q = 100 units and the desired fraction of
demand satisﬁed from shelf is 0.98, what value of s should be used?
b. What is the associated value of the safety stock?
Appendix 8A: Poisson Distribution and Some Derivations
8A.1 Poisson Distribution
An extensive reference is the book by Haight (1967).
8A.1.1 Probability Mass Function
A Poisson variable is an example of a discrete random variable. Its probability mass function (p.m.f.)
is given by
px(x0) = Pr{x = x0} = ax0e−a
x0!
x0 = 0, 1, 2, . . .
(8A.1)
where a is the single parameter of the distribution. The graph rises to a peak, then drops oﬀexcept
for very low values of a where the peak is at x0 = 0.
8A.1.2 Moments
One can show (see, e.g., Rohatgi 1976) that
1. E(x) = ∞
x0=0 x0px(x0) = a
that is, the parameter a is the mean of the distribution.
2. σ2
x = ∞
x0=0 [x0 −E(x)]2 px(x0) = a

■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
Hence, the standard deviation σx is given by
σx = √a
8A.1.3 Expression for Expected Units Short per Cycle with Poisson Demand
For a Poisson variable x with mean a, the probability mass function is deﬁned above in
Equation 8A.1. Deﬁne the cumulative distribution function as
Px(s) =
s
x0=0
px(x0)
Expected units short during a replenishment cycle can be calculated as follows:
ESPRC =


x0=s+1
(x0 −s)px(x0) =

x0=s+1


x0=s+1
ax0−1e−a
(x0 −1)! −s[1 −Px(s)]
By changing the starting point for the index for the summation and adjusting the inner term, the
ﬁrst term of the previous expression can be rewritten as
a
∞

x0=s+1
ax0−1e−a
(x0 −1)! = a
∞

x0=s
ax0e−a
(x0)! = a[1 −Px(s −1)]
leading to the following expression for ESPRC using only the reorder point s, the parameter a, and
the cumulative distribution function.
ESPRC = a[1 −Px(s −1)] −s[1 −Px(s)]
(8A.2)
As shown in Appendix III, we can use standard spreadsheet functions to calculate the ESPRC.
8A.2 Indifference Curves for Poisson Demand
8A.2.1 Case of Q = 1 and a B2 Penalty
Suppose an order-up-to-level S is used, or equivalently, an order for one unit is placed when the
inventory position drops to the level S −1. In this system, the inventory position is eﬀectively
always at the level S. All outstanding orders at a time t must arrive by time t + L and no order

Managing Slow-Moving and Low-Value (Class C) Inventories
■
381
placed after t can arrive by t + L. Therefore, the net (on-hand minus backorders) stock at time
t + L must be equal to the inventory position at time t minus any demand in t to t + L; that is,
(Net stock at time t + L) = S −(demand in L)
or
pNS(n0) = Pr{x = S −n0}
(8A.3)
where
pNS(n0) = probability that the net stock at a random point in time takes on the value n0
x = total demand in the replenishment lead time
Furthermore, with Poisson demand, the probability that a particular demand requires backordering
is equal to the probability that the net stock is zero or less; that is,
Pr{a demand is not satisﬁed} = pNS≤(0)
Using Equation 8A.3, we have
Pr{a demand is not satisﬁed} = px≥(S)
The expected on-hand inventory (¯I) at the end of the lead time is the expected positive net stock
at that time,
¯I =
S

n0=0
n0pNS(n0)
=
S

n0=0
n0px(S −n0)
where
px(x0) = probability that total time demand is x0
Substituting, j = S −n0, we have
¯I =
S

j=0
(S −j)px(j)
The expected shortage costs per unit time (Cs) are
Cs = (cost per shortage) × (expected demand per unit time)
× Pr{a demand is not satisﬁed}
= B2vDpx≥(S)

382
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
Expected total relevant costs per unit time, as a function of S, are
ETRC(S) = ¯Ivr + Cs
= vr
S

j=0
(S −j)px(j) + B2vDpx≥(S)
Notice the similarity with Equation 8.8 which is for Q ≥1. Notice also that the ordering cost
term in Equation 8.8 is not included here, because it drops out in the indiﬀerence curve solution.
These indiﬀerence curves are obtained by equating ETRC(S) to ETRC(S + 1) for a given value of
S. In general, this gives, after simpliﬁcation,
px(S)
px≤(S −1) =
r
DB2
(8A.4)
However, because Q = 1, we have that
s = S −1
Therefore, Equation 8A.4 can be written as
px(s + 1)
px≤(s)
=
r
DB2
Equation 8.4 follows by recognizing that the lead time demand (x) has a Poisson distribution with
mean ˆxL.
8A.2.2 Case of a B1 Cost Penalty
We assume that the cost B1 is incurred only if the demand in the lead time exceeds the reorder
point s. The expected total relevant costs per unit time associated with using a reorder point s are
ETRC(s) = vr
s
x0=0
(s −x0)px(x0) + D
Q B1px>(s)
Again, the ﬁxed cost of ordering is independent of s. Equating ETRC(s) = ETRC(s + 1) for
indiﬀerence between s and s + 1 leads to
px(s + 1)
px≤(s)
= Qvr
DB1
Again, Equation 8.6 follows by recognizing that the lead time demand (x) has a Poisson
distribution with mean ˆxL.
8A.3 Decision Rule for the Size of the Last Replenishment
We are interested in the total remaining demand y for the item, where y is a random variable. We
approximate its mean value E(y) by the total demand ˆy implied by the deterministic representation

Managing Slow-Moving and Low-Value (Class C) Inventories
■
383
of the declining demand rate as a function of time (see Equations 8.17 and 8.18). In addition, we
make the plausible assumption that y has a normal distribution (although the derivation could
be modiﬁed to handle any other desired distribution) with standard deviation σy. Then, closely
paralleling the P2 service derivation in Section 6A.3 of the Appendix of Chapter 6, we have that
the expected shortage over the lifetime
ES = σyGu(k)
and we want
ES
ˆy = 1 −P2
so that
Gu(k) = ˆy(1 −P2)
σy
8A.4 Decision Rule for Disposal of Stock
Assuming a deterministic demand pattern (rate D), the situation is conceptually identical with that
of a special opportunity to procure at a reduced unit cost (see Section 4.9.5 of Chapter 4). Let I be
the current inventory level and W be the disposal amount. Then, as in Section 4.9.5, we look at
costs out to time I/D—that is, when the current inventory would be depleted if no disposal took
place. Under the option of no disposal, the costs would be
CND = I2vr
2D
If we dispose of W , then the remaining stock will run out at time (I −W )/D. Assum-
ing an EOQ strategy after that, the relevant costs of the disposal decision out to time I/D are
approximately
CD = −gW +
I −W
D
 I −W
2

vr + W
D (
√
2ADvr + Dv)
As in Section 4.9.5, we select W to maximize CND −CD. Using calculus, this leads to the
decision rule of Equation 8.21.
8A.5 Decision Rule for Stocking versus Not Stocking
The demand rate per unit time D is given by
D = E(t)/E(i)
(8A.5)
Ignoring the minor eﬀects of the non-unit-sized transactions, we have the same setting as
in the derivation of the economic order quantity (Section 4.2 of Chapter 4). Therefore, from
Equation 4.4 of Chapter 4 and Equation 8.25, the best order quantity, if the item is stocked, is
EOQ =

2AE(t)
vrE(i)

384
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
Moreover, from Equation 4.5 of Chapter 4 and including the cs system cost, the best total
relevant costs per unit time, if the item is stocked, are
TRCs(EOQ) =

2AE(t)vr/E(i) + cs
(8A.6)
If the item is not stocked, there is a cost A associated with each transaction which occurs, on the
average, every E(i) units of time. Therefore, the total relevant costs per unit time, if the item is not
stocked, are
TRCns = A/E(i)
(8A.7)
Clearly, if cs itself is larger than A/E(i), then TRCns < TRCs. This gives the condition of
Equation 8.23. More generally, requiring
TRCns = TRCs
and using Equations 8A.6 and 8A.7 leads to
A/E(i) <

2AE(t)vr/E(i) + cs
or
2AE(t)vr/E(i) >
 A
E(i) −cs
2
that is,
E(t)vr > E(i)
2A
 A
E(i) −cs

Chapter 9
Style Goods and Perishable
Items
The developments in Chapters 4 through 8 were all based on the assumption of a demand pattern
for an item continuing well into the future (possibly on a time-varying basis)—that is, “a going
concern” with the opportunity to store inventory from one selling period to the next. In this
chapter, we remove the ability to indeﬁnitely store inventory, due to perishability or obsolescence.
Decision situations where this type of framework is relevant include
1. The newsvendor: How many copies of a particular issue of a newspaper to stock?
2. The garment manufacturer (or retailer): What quantity of a particular style good should be
produced (or bought for sale) prior to the short selling season?
3. The Christmas tree vendor: How many trees should be purchased to put on sale?
4. The cafeteria manager: How many hot meals of a particular type should be prepared prior to
the arrival of customers?
5. The supermarket manager: How much meat or fresh produce should be purchased for a
particular day of the week?
6. The administrator of a regional blood bank: How many donations of blood should be sought
and how should they be distributed among hospitals?
7. The supplies manager in a remote region (e.g., medical and welfare work in northern
Canada): What quantity of supplies should be brought in by boat prior to the long winter
freeze-up?
8. The farmer: What quantity of a particular crop should be planted in a speciﬁc season?
9. The toy manufacturer: A particular product shows signiﬁcant potential sales as a “fad” item.
How many units should be produced on the one major production run to be made?
These are notoriously diﬃcult decisions. Every Christmas, for instance, news reports focus on
the inability to ﬁnd certain extremely popular toys. At the same time, retailers are left with piles
of toys that turned out to be less popular than expected. Many ﬁrms have been able to slash lead
times by prepositioning raw materials ready for assembly, using air freight to expedite delivery,
communicating orders electronically, and so on. Therefore, they can estimate demand closer to
387

Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
the actual selling season. Unfortunately, they are still faced with considerable uncertainty about
demand.
In the simplest situation, inventory cannot be carried forward at all from one period to the
next. In this context, a single period is relevant for each replenishment decision, thus signiﬁcantly
simplifying the analysis (in part because we generally do not calculate a reorder point). This is in
contrast with the earlier, more general, case where inventory is storable from one period to the
next. In that context, the eﬀects of a replenishment action can last for several periods and thus can
interact with later replenishment actions. If we refer to the lifetime of an item as the length of time
until it becomes obsolete or perishes, then the analysis becomes much more complicated as the
lifetime increases.
In Section 9.1, we spell out in more detail the characteristics (and associated complexity) of
the general style goods problem. The models presented in Sections 9.2 through 9.5 deal with pro-
gressively more realistic, but more complicated, versions of the problem. In Section 9.2, we are
concerned with the case of a single product with but one replenishment (procurement or produc-
tion) opportunity. This is followed in Section 9.3 by the important generalization to more than
one product, thus permitting the aggregate viewpoint ﬁrst emphasized in Chapter 2. Again, an
exchange curve is a key by-product of the analysis. In Section 9.4, we examine the case when dif-
ferentiation of the product can be delayed, a technique known as product postponement. Next,
in Section 9.5, we provide some brief comments concerning the situation where there are several
production periods with capacity restrictions prior to the selling season. Section 9.6 extends the
discussion to the case where obsolescence is several periods in the future. Therefore, there are sev-
eral opportunities to reorder before demand completely disappears. Section 9.7 deals with some
other issues relevant to the control of style goods. The chapter is completed by a discussion in
Section 9.8 concerning items subject to perishability.
9.1 Style Goods Problem
The main features of the style goods problem are:
1. There is a relatively short (typically no longer than 3 or 4 months) selling season with a
well-deﬁned beginning and end.
2. Buyers (at the stocking point) or producers have to commit themselves to a large extent, in
terms of how much of each SKU to order or produce, prior to the start of the selling season.
3. There may be one or more opportunities for replenishment after the initial order is placed.
Such replenishment actions may be taken prior to the selling season (if the forecast of demand
has risen appreciably) or during the early part of the selling season itself (if actual demand
to date indicates that the original forecast was considerably low). Occasionally, the season
extends several periods in the future; we will discuss such a situation in Section 9.6.
4. Forecasts prior to the season include considerable uncertainty stemming from the long period
of inactivity (no sales) between seasons. During this inactive period, the economic conditions
or style considerations may have changed appreciably. Consequently, forecast revisions tend
to be heavily inﬂuenced by ﬁrm orders or sales to date in the current season, far more than
in the case of reasonably stable items (as discussed in Chapter 3).
5. When the total demand in the season exceeds the stock made available, there are associ-
ated underage costs. These may simply be lost proﬁt if the sales are foregone. On the other
hand, they may represent the added costs of expediting (e.g., a special order by air freight) or
acquiring the material from a competitor at a high unit value.

6. When the total demand in the season turns out to be less than the stock made available,
overage costs result. The unit salvage value of leftover inventory at the end of a season is likely
to be quite low (well below the unit acquisition cost). It is quite expensive to carry stock over
to the next season; moreover, there is no guarantee that such leftover stock will even sell at
that time. Markdowns (i.e., reduced selling prices) or transfers (between locations) may be
used to avoid leftover stock. (Incidentally, the style goods situation can be thought of as a
special case of perishability where there is not physical deterioration but, instead, a marked
deterioration in the economic value of the goods as of a particular point in time.)
7. Style goods products are often substitutable. Depending on how ﬁnely one deﬁnes a style,
a stockout in one SKU does not necessarily mean a lost sale, because the demand may be
satisﬁed by another product.
8. Sales of style goods are usually inﬂuenced by promotional activities, and space allocation in
the store, among other things.
In the simplest form of the style goods problem, wherein we ignore the last two points made
above as well as markdowns and transfers, the remaining decision variables are the timing and
magnitude of the replenishment quantities. To illustrate the complexity of even this simpliﬁed
version, we need only refer to the early work of Wadsworth (1959). He considered the case of
a style good sold in a fall season with raw material acquisition required in the spring, summer
production of unlimited capacity, and a limited amount of fall production (after the total season
demand is known exactly) being possible but at a higher unit cost than the summer production.
The complex nature of Wadsworth’s solution to this problem indicates that an exact analysis of a
more realistic style goods problem is out of the question. For this reason, as elsewhere in this book,
for all but the simplest problems we advocate the use of heuristic methods designed to generate
reasonable solutions.
9.2 Simplest Case: Unconstrained, Single-Item,
Newsvendor Problem
9.2.1 Determination of the Order Quantity by Marginal Analysis
Let us consider the situation faced by the owner of a newsstand. Each day he has to decide on
the number of copies of a particular paper to stock. There is an underage cost, cu, associated with
each demand that cannot be met, and an overage cost, co, associated with each copy that is not
sold. Suppose the underage cost was exactly equal to the overage cost. Then it seems intuitively
reasonable that he would want to select the number (Q) of copies to purchase such that there was a
50% chance of the total demand being below Q and a 50% chance of it being above Q. But what
about the case where cu = 2co or cu = 3co? It turns out that his decision rule should be to select
the Q∗value that satisﬁes
pu<(Q∗) =
cu
cu + co
(9.1)
where px<(x0) is the probability that the total demand x is less than the value x0.
Notice that when cu = co Equation 9.1 gives
pu<(Q∗) = 0.5
which is the intuitive result discussed above.

When cu = 2co, we have from Equation 9.1
pu<(Q∗) =
2co
2co + co
= 2
3
that is, he should select the order quantity such that the probability of the total demand being
smaller than the order quantity is two-thirds.
Now let us reﬂect on how Equation 9.1 is developed. The simplest derivation is a marginal
analysis, as ﬁrst used in Section 6A.1 of the Appendix of Chapter 6. The argument proceeds as
follows.
Consider the Qth unit purchased. It will be sold if, and only if, the total demand equals or
exceeds Q; otherwise, an overage cost will be incurred for this Qth unit. However, if the demand
equals or exceeds Q, we have avoided an underage cost by having the Qth unit available. In other
words, we have the analysis shown in Table 9.1.
Consider a particular Qth unit. If the expected overage cost associated with acquiring it
exceeded the expected saving in underage costs, we would not want to acquire that unit. In
fact, we might not want to acquire the (Q −1)st, the (Q −2)nd, and so forth. On the other
hand, if the expected saving in underage costs exceeded the expected overage cost associated with
acquiring the Qth unit, we would want to acquire it. However, we might also wish to acquire the
(Q + 1)st, the (Q + 2)nd, etc. The last unit (Q∗) we would want to acquire is that one where the
expected overage cost incurred exactly equaled the expected underage cost saved; that is, Q∗must
satisfy
copx<(Q∗) = cu[1 −px<(Q∗)]
or
px<(Q∗) =
cu
cu + co
which is Equation 9.1.
The solution of Equation 9.1 is shown graphically in Figure 9.1 where we have plotted the
cumulative distribution of demand, px<(x0). Locate the value of cu/(cu+co) on the vertical axis,
come across horizontally to the curve, then move down vertically to read the corresponding x0,
which is the Q∗value. There is always a solution because the fraction lies between zero and unity,
which is the range covered by the cumulative distribution.
We have just seen that the marginal cost analysis approach leads to the decision rule of Equa-
tion 9.1 in a rather straightforward fashion. However, it does not give us an expression for
evaluating the expected costs when any particular Q value is used. The alternative approach of
minimizing total cost does, but the analysis is more complicated.

9.2.2 An Equivalent Result Obtained through Profit Maximization
The above discussion has centered on cost minimization. Instead, let us now approach the problem
from a proﬁt maximization standpoint. Let
v = acquisition cost, in dollars/unit
p = revenue per sale (i.e., the selling price), in dollars/unit
B(or B2v) = penalty (beyond the lost proﬁt) for not satisfying demand, in dollars/unit (B2,
as in Chapter 6, is the fraction of unit value that is charged per unit of demand
unsatisﬁed)
g = salvage value, in dollars/unit
As earlier, we let
Q = quantity to be stocked, in units
and px<(x0) represent the cumulative distribution of total demand, the probability that total
demand x takes on a value less than x0.
Then, as shown in Section 9A.1 of the Appendix of this chapter, the decision rule is to select
the Q∗that satisﬁes
px<(Q∗) = p −v + B
p −g + B
(9.2)

392
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
This result is identical with that of Equation 9.1 when we realize that the cost of underage is
given by
cu = p −v + B
and the cost of overage is
cu = v −g
Because the cumulative distribution function is nondecreasing as its argument increases, we can
make the following intuitively appealing deductions from Equation 9.2.
1. If the sales price, cost per unit short, or salvage value increases, the best Q increases.
2. If the acquisition cost per unit increases, the best Q decreases.
As shown in Section 9A.1 of the Appendix of this chapter, the expected proﬁt is
E[P(Q)] = (p −g)ˆx −(v −g)Q −(p −g + B)ES
(9.3)
where ˆx is expected demand and ES is the expected number of units short, or expected shortages.
If we let EO represent expected units left over, we can also represent the expected proﬁt as
E[P(Q)] = (p −v)ˆx −(v −g)EO −(p −v + B)ES
= (p −v)ˆx −coEO −cuES
(9.4)
This rearrangement shows the expected proﬁt as a “perfect information” expected proﬁt term minus
an overstocking loss and an understocking loss. The ﬁrst term of Equation 9.4 is the expected proﬁt
we would receive if we knew what demand would be and chose the quantity to exactly meet that
demand.
9.2.3 Case of Normally Distributed Demand
The result of Equation 9.1 or 9.2 is applicable for any distribution of total demand. Again, it is
worthwhile, as in Chapter 6, to look at the special case of normally distributed demand. First, such
a distribution tends to be applicable in a signiﬁcant number of situations. Second, as we will see,
sensitivity analysis (eﬀects of incorrectly specifying the order quantity Q) can be performed rather
easily when demand is normal, in contrast with the case of a general probability distribution.
Suppose the demand is normally distributed with a mean of ˆx and a standard deviation of σx
and we deﬁne
k = Q −ˆx
σx
(9.5)
This is analogous to what we did in Chapter 6. Then, as shown in Section 9A.1 of the Appendix
of this chapter, the decision rule of Equation 9.2 transforms to
Select k such that pu≥(k) =
v −g
p −g + B
(9.6)
where pu≥(k) is the probability that a unit normal variable takes on a value of k or larger; this is
a widely tabulated function (see, e.g., Table II.1 of Appendice II) ﬁrst introduced in Chapter 6.
Then, from Equation 9.5, set
Q = ˆx + kσx
(9.7)

Style Goods and Perishable Items
■
393
Furthermore, in this case, as shown in the Appendix of this chapter, we obtain a relatively
simple expression for expected proﬁt as a function of Q, namely,
E[P(Q)] = (p −g)ˆx −(v −g)Q −(p −g + B)σxGu
Q −ˆx
σx

(9.8)
where Gu(u0) is a tabulated function of the unit normal variable (see Table II.1 of Appendice II)
ﬁrst introduced in Chapter 6. It can also be shown that (see Section A.1 of the Appendix of this
chapter):

9.2.3.1 Numerical Illustration
Sales of ski equipment and apparel depend heavily on the snow conditions. A small discount retailer
(called The Ski Bum) of ski equipment near some of the large ski areas of New Hampshire and
Vermont faces the diﬃcult task of ordering a particular line of ski gloves in the month of May well
before the ski season begins. The selling price for these gloves is $50.30 per pair, while the cost to
the retailer is only $35.10. The retailer can usually buy additional gloves from competitors at their
retail price of $60. Gloves left over at the end of the short selling season are sold at a special discount
price of $25 per pair. The owner and manager of the store assumes that demand is approximately
normally distributed with a mean of 900 gloves and a standard deviation of 122 gloves.* Using our
notation
p = $50.30/pair
v = $35.10/pair
g = $25.00/pair
B = ($60.00 −50.30) or $9.70/pair
From Equation 9.6, we want
pu≥(k) =
35.10 −25
50.30 −25 + 9.70 = 0.288
* One way of arriving at an estimate of the standard deviation would be to specify the probability that total demand
exceeded a certain value (other than the mean); for example, prob (x ≥1,100) = 0.05 leads to the standard
deviation of 122 pairs. For x normally distributed,
Pr(x ≥1,100) = pu≥

From the table in Appendix II, we have
k = 0.56
Therefore, Equation 9.7 gives
Q = 900 + 0.56(122) = 968.3, say 968 pairs
The use of Equation 9.8 gives the expected proﬁt for various values of Q; the results are shown
in Table 9.2. It is interesting to note that by following the temptation of ordering the expected
demand—namely, Q = 900—we would be led to a 2.0% reduction in expected proﬁt.
Lau (1980) has shown that, for any demand distribution, to maximize the probability of achiev-
ing a target proﬁt, T, one should choose Q∗such that Q∗= T/(p −v). For the example above,
to maximize the probability of achieving a proﬁt of $10,690, set Q∗= 703, whereas to maximize
the probability of achieving a proﬁt of $12,220, set Q∗= 804. Note that these order quantities
are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from those that provide the same expected proﬁt (from Table 9.2). The
optimal probability that proﬁt achieves (or exceeds) the optimal expected proﬁt target is of course
1 −px<(Q∗). See also Sankarasubramanian and Kumaraswamy (1983).
9.2.4 Case of a Fixed Charge to Place the Order
Where there is a high enough ﬁxed setup cost A to place any size order, the best strategy may be to
not order anything at all. The decision would be based on comparing the cost of not ordering at
all with the expected proﬁt (ignoring the ﬁxed cost as we did earlier) under use of the Q∗value:
If E[P(Q∗)] > A −Bˆx, order Q∗
If E[P(Q∗)] < A −Bˆx, order nothing

Style Goods and Perishable Items
■
395
If there is inventory on hand at the start of the period, the policy of ordering Q∗should be seen
as ordering up to Q∗instead. Observe then that there is a threshold value implied in the decision
rule. If A is large enough, do not order. Otherwise, order up to Q∗. Said another way, if beginning
inventory is relatively high, the penalty cost associated with not ordering will be relatively low,
so do not order. However, if inventory is very low, order up to Q∗. This policy is a single-period
version of the (s, S) policy introduced in Chapter 7. See Porteus (1990). As discussed above, we do
not advocate explicitly determining s. Rather, for any given initial inventory level, we compare the
expected proﬁt of not ordering with the expected proﬁt of using the best order-up-to-level, given
that we order.
9.2.5 Case of Discrete Demand
Strictly speaking, when we are dealing with discrete (integer) units of demand and purchase quan-
tity, it is unlikely that there is an integer Q value that exactly satisﬁes Equation 9.1 or 9.2. To
illustrate, suppose we have an item where
cu
cu + co
= 0.68
and the probability distribution of demand is as shown in the second row of the following table

9.2.5.1 Numerical Illustration
Consider the case of a Mennonite farmer who raises cattle and sells the beef at the weekly farmer’s
market in Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario. He is particularly concerned about a speciﬁc expensive
cut of meat. He sells it in a uniform size of 5 kg at a price of $30. He wants to know how many
5-kg units to take to market. Demand is not known with certainty; all that he has available are
frequency counts of the total 5-kg units demanded in each of the last 20 market sessions. These
are chronologically as follows: 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 5, 1, 2, 4, 4, 2, 3, 4, 1, 5, 2, 2, 3, 1, and 4. Frequency
counts of how many 1’s, how many 2’s, etc. occurred in the 20 weeks are shown in the second row
of Table 9.3. The third row is a set of estimates of the probabilities of the various sized demands
based on the assumption that the historical occurrences are representative of the probabilities. For

example, in 6 out of 20 weeks, the total demand has been 2 units; therefore, the probability of a
total demand of 2 units is approximately 6/20 or 0.3.
The farmer stores the processed beef in a freezer on his farm. He estimates the value of a 5-kg
unit to be $19 after he removes it from the freezer and gets it to the market. Once the beef is
brought to market, he chooses not to take it home and refreeze it. Therefore, any leftover beef at
the market he sells to a local butcher at a discount price of $15 per 5-kg unit. Finally, other than
the foregone proﬁt, he feels that there is no additional cost (e.g., loss of goodwill) associated with
not satisfying a demand.
According to our notation
p = $30/unit
v = $19/unit
B = 0
g = $15/unit
Therefore,
p −v + B
p −g + B = 30 −19 + 0
30 −15 + 0 = 0.733
The use of the fourth row of Table 9.3, together with the decision rule of Equation 9.10, shows
that he should bring four 5-kg units to market. It is interesting to note that the average or expected
demand is
ˆx =

x0
x0px(x0) = (1)(0.2) + 2(0.3) + 3(0.2) + 4(0.2) + 5(0.1)
= 2.7 units
Therefore, because of the economics, the best strategy is to take (4 −2.7) or 1.3 units above
the average demand.
For other non-normal demand distributions, see Scarf (1958), Gallego and Moon (1993), and
Moon and Choi (1995). In particular, if the demand distribution is not known, but managers
have some sense of the mean and variance of demand, Scarf (1958) and Gallego and Moon (1993)
show that using the following formula maximizes the expected proﬁt against the worst possible
distribution of demand:

For the numerical example given for the normal distribution, this formula yields an order
quantity of 925, versus 968 when the distribution is known to be normal. We can see from Table
9.2 that the cost penalty of using 925 is quite small.
9.3 Single-Period, Constrained, Multi-Item Situation
Now we consider the situation of more than one type of SKU to be stocked for a single period’s
demand. It should be emphasized that the model to be developed here is based on the assumption
of independent demands for the various products. However, there is a space or budget constraint
on the group of items. Examples include the following:
1. Several diﬀerent newspapers sharing a limited space or budget in a corner newsstand.
2. A buyer for a style goods department of a retail outlet who has a budget limitation for a group
of items.
3. The provisioning of supplies or spare parts on a spacecraft, submarine, or the like, prior to a
long mission without the possibility of resupply.
4. The repair kit taken by a maintenance crew on a routine visit to an operating facility.
We illustrate the solution procedure for the case of a restriction on the total dollar value of the
units stocked. The procedure is quite similar if the constraint is on space, capacity, or some other
resource. We discuss how one would adapt the approach for some other constrained resource. First,
some notation is required. Let
n = number of diﬀerent items (SKUs) involved (numbered 1, 2, 3, . . . , n)
ipx<(x0) = Pr{total demand for item i is less than x0}
vi = acquisition cost of item i, in $/unit
pi = selling price of item i, in $/unit
Bi = penalty (beyond the lost proﬁt) for not satisfying demand of item i, in $/unit
gi = salvage value of item i, in $/unit
W = budget available for allocation among the stocks of the n items, in dollars
We are assuming the budget is constrained, and that a manager wishes to use up the total
budget to maximize the total expected proﬁt of the n items. If this is not necessarily the case, each
item i’s unconstrained optimal Q∗
i should be ascertained independently using Equation 9.2. If the
total  Q∗
i vi < W , then the Q∗
i s should be used. If not, the constrained approach must be used
to ﬁnd the Qis.
As shown in Section 9A.2 of the Appendix of this chapter, a convenient way to solve this prob-
lem is through the use of a Lagrange multiplier. This approach is useful for multi-item problems
that are connected through some common resource constraint. In this case, it is relatively easy
to solve each single-item problem using Equation 9.2, but of course this leads to a solution that
exceeds the budget constraint. The Lagrange multiplier approach works by charging a penalty cost
M per unit of resource consumed beyond the budget. In this case, the unit of resource is a dollar
of the budget.

The resulting decision procedure is*
Step 1 Select an initial positive value of the multiplier, M.
Step 2 Determine each Qi (i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , n) to satisfy
ipx<(Qi) = pi −(M + 1)vi + Bi

with W .
If  Qivi ≈W , stop. The optimal solution has been obtained.
If  Qivi < W , return to Step 2 with a smaller value of M.
If  Qivi > W , return to Step 2 with a larger value of M.
The multiplier has an interesting economic interpretation; it is the value (in terms of increased
total expected proﬁt) of adding one more dollar to the available budget, W . We revisit this
interpretation in the context of the numerical illustration below.
It is important to recognize that as diﬀerent values of M are used, we are actually tracing out an
exchange curve of total expected proﬁt versus total allowed budget (investment in stock). This is
illustrated in Figure 9.2, which is an exchange curve for the numerical illustration to be presented
momentarily.
Other research on the multiproduct problem includes Nahmias and Schmidt (1984), Lau and
Lau (1988, 1994, 1996b), Li et al. (1990, 1991), and Jönsson and Silver (1996). Erlebacher (2000)
develops simple expressions for certain special cases such as when all items follow a uniform dis-
tribution or all items follow the same demand distribution. Lau and Lau (1996b) show that if
demand can never be zero, or has a very long left tail, it may be impossible to solve Equation 9.11
for certain values of M. Therefore, common search methods, such as the one given above, may not
work. They provide a more complex method that works for any distribution.
The above formulation assumes that the individual-item stocking decisions have independent
eﬀects on the objective function to be maximized or minimized. Smith et al. (1980) have addressed
the following more complicated situation, often called the “repair kit problem.” Consider the kit
of spare parts stocked by a repair crew visiting an oﬀ-site location. A particular repair job may
require more than one spare part. An appropriate measure of eﬀectiveness is now the fraction of
jobs completed without stockout, as opposed to the fraction of needed individual spare parts that
are provided. In addition, Mamer and Smith (1982) extend the analysis to the situation where
part demands are no longer independent. See also Graves (1982), Hausman (1982), Scudder and
March (1984), Mamer and Smith (1985), Mamer and Shogan (1987), and Moon et al. (2000).
* If the constraint is, instead, of a production nature such that no more than W units can be produced, then the
decision procedure is modiﬁed in two ways:
1. Equation 9.12 is changed to
ipx<(Qi) = pi −vi −M + Bi
pi −gi + Bi
2. In Step 3, we compare n
i=1 Qi with W .

9.3.1 Numerical Illustration
Suppose The Ski Bum was faced with decisions on four items rather than just the one illustrated
in Section 9.2.3. The manager is willing to accept that in each case total demand is normally
distributed. For the case of normally distributed demand, Equation 9.12 becomes
pu≥(ki) = (M + 1)vi −gi
pi −gi + Bi
(9.13)
where, as earlier, pu≥(ki) is the probability that a unit normal variable takes on a value of ki or
larger (tabulated in Appendix II) and
Qi = max(0, ˆxi + kiσi)
(9.14)
where
ˆxi = forecast demand for item i
σi = standard deviation of the demand for item i (here we have simpliﬁed the notation
somewhat to avoid a subsubscript)
The relevant parameter values are estimated to be as shown in the top six rows of Table 9.4.
The manager has a budget of $70,000 to allocate among these four items. She would like to know
how to do this. She is also quite interested in the proﬁt impact if the budget is changed somewhat.

The right-hand side of Equation 9.12 exceeds unity, implying that ki (or equivalently
Qi) should be set at its lowest possible value. The lowest value for Qi is zero from
Equation 9.14.
b By trial and error, it was found that this value of M was required to produce a total used budget
of approximately 70,000.
The calculations for several values of the multiplier M are shown in the lower part of Table 9.4
and the results are shown graphically in Figure 9.2. If there is no budget constraint, all items would
be stocked, a budget of $94,930 would be needed, and the expected proﬁt would be $36,824.
We can see that the expected total proﬁt is $28,755 when the proposed budget of approximately
$70,000 is used. However, increasing the budget could lead to a substantial improvement in the

total proﬁt, a useful piece of information for the owner. The far right part of the curve shows that
the total expected proﬁt would start to decrease if the budget was too high and the manager was
required to invest the whole amount in stocks of the four items (a negative value of M applies in
this region). Three signiﬁcant values of M are indicated in Figure 9.2. These values correspond to
points at which the critical fractile (Equation 9.13) for one of the products equals zero, indicating
it is unattractive to produce and stock that product. As shown in Table 9.4, a value of M ≈
0.5093 generated a set of order quantities that consumed the proposed budget of $70,000. As
stated in the previous section, this value of M is the value in terms of expected proﬁt of adding
one more dollar to the budget; another dollar of budget would generate approximately $0.51 in
expected proﬁt. Another important set of managerial insights that can be gleaned from this problem
formulation relates to comparisons across the items competing for the same budget. Notice that
when the budget is quite constrained some products are not suﬃciently attractive to order at all.
For example, at M = 0.6 (leading to a budget of $38,951), items 3 and 4 are not ordered at all.
See Problem 9.26.
9.4 Postponed Product Differentiation
Because of the enormous variety and stiﬀdelivery time requirements characterizing many style
goods, such as fashion apparel, ﬁrms have been developing creative ways to reduce costs and
improve delivery performance. One ﬁrm that has generated much interest is Benetton. By chang-
ing the order of production—their revised system switched the order from dye then knit, to knit
then dye—Benetton was able to gain dramatic operational beneﬁts. By switching the order of oper-
ations, Benetton was able to produce “plain” sweaters and then later dye them, only committing
them to their ﬁnal product form when more accurate demand information was available. This
approach is known as delayed (or postponed) product diﬀerentiation or postponement.
Lee and Tang (1998) develop formal models to show when operations reversal is desirable.
They show that when the major source of demand uncertainty is due to the option mix, but the
total demand for all options is fairly stable, then the sequence of operations should have one or
more of the following properties:
1. The ﬁrst operation has the longer lead time if the value added of the two operations are
roughly equal.
2. The value added of the ﬁrst operation is less than the second operation, if the lead times are
the same.
3. The ﬁrst operation takes longer to perform, but the value added per unit of lead time for the
ﬁrst operation is smaller than or equal to the value added per unit of lead time for the second
stage.
They provide several other properties, and they note that if total demand is highly variable, then
the operation order suggested by these properties should be exactly reversed. See also Swaminathan
and Tayur (1998), Fisher et al. (1999), and Randall and Ulrich (2001) for other examples of using
the ideas of postponed product diﬀerentiation to manage multiple end items.
To adopt a postponement strategy, a ﬁrm typically manufactures a semiﬁnished or base product
that can later be ﬁnished into a ﬁnal product. The Benetton setting describes such an exam-
ple where the base product is the un-dyed sweater. This may require a redesign of the product
and/or the process. Lee et al. (1993) discuss such a redesign eﬀort. Ramdas (2003) provides

402
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
a broader discussion about managing product variety, including a discussion of manufacturing
process capabilities that are essential in adopting postponement strategies.
There are two key factors that drive the potential operational improvement obtained by post-
poning product diﬀerentiation. First, by delaying some of the manufacturing value-add, the
per-unit overstocking cost is reduced. Second, by delaying the commitment of the product into
its ﬁnal form, a ﬁrm can improve performance, either reducing safety stock or improving the level
of service. We explore each of these two factors next, providing a numerical illustration in each case
of the performance improvement obtained.
9.4.1 Value of Delayed Financial Commitment
We use the subscript 0 to represent the base product (e.g., the un-dyed sweater in the Benetton
setting discussed above). Let t represent the additional transformation cost to convert a base prod-
uct into a ﬁnished product. This means the cost to acquire (or produce) a base product and then
transform that base product is v0 +t. As before, let g denote the salvage value for the ﬁnished prod-
uct. Let g0 denote the salvage value for the base product. Here, we assume that the base product
can be transformed into the ﬁnished item at the time demand is realized. This means that a ﬁrm
will stock out when supply of the base product is insuﬃcient and will incur the transformation
cost only for products that are sold. In Section 9.5, we discuss the substantially more complicated
situation when the transformation decision must be made before ﬁnal demand occurs but after the
ﬁrm has updated their demand forecast.
With these assumptions, the cost of understocking is cu = p −v0 −t + B while the cost
of overstocking is v0 −g0. As in Section 9.2.2, let EO, ES represent expected leftover units and
expected units short, respectively. Letting Q0 represent the quantity of base product acquired, the
expected proﬁt is
E[P(Q0)] = (p −v0 −t)ˆx −(v0 −g0)EO −(p −v0 −t + B)ES
(9.15)
Following Equation 9.1, we get that the best quantity satisﬁes:
pu<(Q∗
0) =
cu
cu + co
= p −v0 −t + B
p −g0 −t + B
(9.16)
Whether or not there is a beneﬁt to the delayed ﬁnancial commitment in this single-item setting
depends on the relationship between the costs in the original system and this new system. To see
why there is potential for savings, let us ﬁrst simplify to the case where the total unit cost is the
same in the two systems, v = v0+t, and the two salvage values are the same g0 = g. Note that these
relationships may not hold in general, but this simpliﬁcation allows us to understand the source of
the potential savings. Under these assumptions, the only diﬀerence between the two systems is that
the cost of overstocking is lower in the postponed system (v0 instead of v0 + t) since the cost t is
not incurred unless the demand is realized.
9.4.1.1 Numerical Illustration
Suppose The Ski Bum has historically purchased and sold a particular ski/binding package where
the bindings are mounted (attached to the skis) by the distributor. The manager assumes that
demand is approximately normally distributed with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 20.

Style Goods and Perishable Items
■
403
This particular ski package sells for $500, costs $300, and can be sold at the end of the season for
$100. The manager estimates that failing to satisfy a demand will result in a future lost sale of a
comparable ski package that would result in a similar margin contribution. So, the manager uses a
penalty cost equal to the current product margin of $200. In our notation:
p = $500/pair
v = $300/pair
g = $100/pair
B = $200/pair
This is a standard newsvendor problem (no delayed product diﬀerentiation). Using the same
approach as in Section 9.2.3, we obtain the results summarized in Table 9.5.
Now, suppose The Ski Bum management can purchase the skis and bindings separately for
a total of $275. It is estimated that it will cost approximately $25 to mount the bindings in the
store at the time of customer demand. Management also estimates that they can sell the skis and
bindings at the end of the season and recoup the same $100 salvage value. In our notation:
p = $500/pair
v0 = $275/pair
t = $25/pair
g0 = $100/pair
B = $200/pair
Following Equation 9.16,
pu<(Q∗) = p −v0 −t + B
p −g0 −t + B = 500 −275 −25 + 200
500 −100 −25 + 200 = 400
575
(9.17)
Since demand is assumed to be normally distributed, we can use Appendix II or a spreadsheet
formula to get k = 0.512. The results are summarized in Table 9.5 for easy comparison to the
nonpostponed case.
From Table 9.5, we see that adopting this delayed diﬀerentiation results in a slightly higher
stocking quantity and slightly higher proﬁt. In this example, the cost of understocking is the same
in both systems but the cost of overstocking is lower in the postponed system since the t = $25
transformation cost is not incurred for items purchased but not sold. Since the cost consequences
of overstocking are less severe, the ﬁrm is willing to purchase more. This also results in an increase
in proﬁt of a little more than 2%. Certainly no manager would turn down a 2% increase in proﬁt,
but as we will see in the next section, the potential beneﬁts of postponement really kick in when
multiple items are served from the same base product.
In some settings, the total unit and transformation cost is higher when postponement is
adopted. It can be veriﬁed for this example that if the transformation cost is t = 28.53, the proﬁt
in the two systems is the same. That is, The Ski Bum could tolerate slightly higher total product
costs under postponement and still obtain the same expected proﬁt.
9.4.2 Value of Flexibility
We now consider the case where there are multiple end items created from the same base product.
First, we address the special case where the cost of understocking pi −v0 −ti + Bi (where ti is the

transformation cost for item i) is the same for all products. Making this simplifying assumption
allows us to use the standard newsvendor formulation to calculate the optimal base product quan-
tity. We subsequently relax this limiting assumption below and discuss how to address the more
general multiple-item setting.
To see why the relative cost of understocking across items is critical to the analysis, consider the
situation where a ﬁrm discovers they are in short supply after observing demand. They must make
a choice of how to prioritize demand for diﬀerent items. At this point in the decision timeline, the
ﬁrm knows they are in short supply and thus will not incur overstocking costs. This means they
will seek to minimize the understocking cost by ﬁrst serving the demand for the item with the
highest understocking cost, then the next one, and so on. If we assume that all understocking costs
are the same, we can formulate the expected proﬁt, and determine the ideal base product quantity
by calculating only the total expected units short rather than the expected units short for each item.
Let ˆxi, σi represent mean and standard deviation of demand for item i = 1, . . . , n, and let
ˆx0, σ0 represent the mean and standard deviation of total demand across all items. We obtain
the mean for total demand by adding the individual means, ˆx0 = n
i=1 ˆx. Here we will assume
that demands for these items are mutually independent, meaning we obtain the variance for total
demand by adding the variance of the individual demands, σ2
0 = n
i=1 σ2
i . It may not be the case
in practice that the demands are independent.
The cost of overstocking is the same as in the previous section co = v0 −g0. Under our
assumption that the cost of understocking is the same for any stockout, cu = pi −v0 −ti + Bi, we
can formulate the expected proﬁt as
E[P(Q0)] =
n

where EO and ES are expected units left over and expected units short based on Q0 and the total
demand described by ˆx0, σ0. Following Equation 9.1, we get that the best quantity satisﬁes
pu<(Q∗
0) =
cu
cu + co
= p −v0 −ti + Bi
p −g0 −ti + Bi
(9.19)
We now consider the case where costs of understocking are diﬀerent across items. For this
setting, we need to know the expected units short for each item rather than just the total expected
units short. Letting ESi represent expected units short for item i, the expected proﬁt function is
E[P(Q0)] =

Our experience is that for most settings where this newsvendor model is appropriate, demand is
occurring over a moderately long selling season and retailers tend to serve demand ﬁrst-come ﬁrst-
serve. We ﬁrst address this setting and discuss below the case where the retailer may be able to
prioritize the use of the base product for more critical end-item demand.
If the retailer follows a policy of meeting end-item demand as it occurs, we can simplify the
expected proﬁt given in Equation 9.20 by using an average cost of understocking. We recommend
using the demand-weighted average cost of understocking. That is, if item 1 has twice the average
demand as item 2, we would give twice the weight to the cost of understocking for item 1. Formally,
let ¯cu be the weighted-average cost of understocking, obtained as follows:

Now we can use the same, single-item newsvendor approach as before, with ¯cu as the cost of
understocking and (v0 −g0) as the cost of overstocking.
If a ﬁrm has the ability to prioritize use of the base product, it should choose to meet
more demand for items with higher understocking costs at the expense of items with lower-
understocking costs. To illustrate this eﬀect, we consider the setting where the retailer sees all
demands at once. The exact approach requires some eﬀort in determining the expected units short
for each item, ESi. We comment on this approach further below, but ﬁrst we suggest an approxi-
mate approach based on the observation that the item with the lowest understocking cost that will
have the most missed sales since demand for that item will always be prioritized last. Let cmin
u
rep-
resent the lowest understocking cost among the items. If we assume that all missed sales incurred
are for this item, we can modify Equation 9.18 to be
E[P(Q0)] =
n

i=1
(pi −v0 −ti)ˆxi −coEO −cmin

(9.22)
and the optimal solution can then be found using the same newsvendor approach we have already
seen several times with overstocking and understocking costs co, cmin
u
. This simpliﬁed approach risks
overstating the expected proﬁt slightly as we assumed that all missed sales incur the lowest-possible
understocking cost.
It is possible to ﬁnd values for expected units short for each item. To illustrate how, suppose
we have only two items and that item 1 has the higher understocking cost (meaning demand for

406

item 1 will be met ﬁrst). As noted above, we can calculate the total ES based on Q0 and ˆx0, σ0.
Since demand for item 1 will always be met ﬁrst if possible, we can calculate ES1 by using the same
Q0 and ˆx1, σ1. If we know the total expected units short and the expected units short for item 1,
expected units short for item 2 must be the diﬀerence between the total and item 1 missed sales,
ES2 = ES −ES1.
9.4.2.1 Numerical Illustration
One of the popular snowboards sold by The Ski Bum comes with either a glossy or matte ﬁnish.
The type of ﬁnish is determined at the time the topsheet is applied to the board. Historically, the
retailer has purchased and sold matte and glossy snowboards separately but is now considering
switching to a postponement system where the desired ﬁnish can be applied in the shop at the time
of the customer order.
The snowboard with matte ﬁnish sells for $400 while the glossy-ﬁnish board sells for $450.
The unit costs for either board are $200 if purchased from the manufacturer with the ﬁnish already
applied. It costs $190 to buy an unﬁnished board and $20 to complete the ﬁnishing in the shop.
Any type of board can be sold at the end of season for $50. The manager estimates that failing
to satisfy a demand will result in future lost business of $300. In our notation (let subscripts g, m
represent glossy and matte):
pg, pm = $450, $400
vg, vm = $190
tg, tm = $20
gg = $50
Bg, Bm = $300
The manager estimates that demand for glossy-ﬁnish boards is normally distributed with mean 90
and standard deviation 25 while the demand for matte boards is normally distributed with mean
80 and standard deviation 20. Demand for the boards occurs throughout the winter selling season,
so The Ski Bum meets demands as they come and cannot prioritize one over the other. This means
the approach of using the weighted average understocking cost is appropriate. With postponement,
the cost of understocking for each of the two boards is obtained using Equation 9.21
¯cu = ˆxg(pg −vg + Bg)
(ˆxg + ˆxm)
+ ˆxm(pm −vm + Bm)
(ˆxg + ˆxm)
=

90
90 + 80

($560) +

80
90 + 80

($510) = $536.47
The cost of overstocking an unﬁnished board is the cost of the board minus the salvage value,
v0 −g0 = $190 −$50 = $140. To obtain the ideal stocking quantity of unﬁnished boards, we
need the mean and standard deviation of total demand. The average demand is the sum of the
individual-item averages, ˆx0 = ˆxg + ˆxm = 170. As noted above, we assume that item demands are
independent, so we get the standard deviation by taking the square root of the sum of the variances,
σ0 =

σ2g + σ2m = 32. The ideal quantity is then obtained with this mean and standard deviation
and the critical fractile obtained using the costs of overstocking and<?pag ?> understocking.

Since demand is assumed to be normally distributed, we can use Appendix II or a spreadsheet
formula to get k = 0.817 and an ideal order quantity for the base product of 196. It is straightfor-
ward to follow the approaches outlined above to determine quantities and expected proﬁts for the
case where the two snowboards are managed separately, without postponement. Results are sum-
marized in Table 9.6 for easy comparison to the nonpostponed case. From Table 9.6, we see the
ﬂexibility beneﬁt made possible by delaying product diﬀerentiation. Even though the total product
and transformation cost is higher, the postponed system generates higher expected proﬁt, $32,312
instead of $29,442; a gain of almost 10%. Examining the expected units short and expected units
left over (ES, EO), it is clear that the increase in proﬁt comes from reducing the mismatch between
supply and demand. Total expected missed sales drops from 5.74 to 3.73, and total units left over
drops from 40.25 to 29.89.
The preceding analysis assumed that The Ski Bum served each demand as it arrived and could
not prioritize demand for one item over the other. Suppose instead that The Ski Bum had to
order snowboards well in advance of the ski season, in the summer perhaps, but all customers
would pre-order in the fall. In such a case, The Ski Bum could then determine which demands
to meet. It should be clear that they would prefer to sell a glossy board since it has a higher cost
of understocking. Using the approach outlined in the previous section, the only change that needs
to be made is that the lower cost of understocking of $510 replaces the weighted-average cost of

408
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
understocking of $536.47. This results in a value of k of 0.776, a slightly lower-order quantity of
195 and a slightly higher proﬁt of $32,453. Of course, we would expect the proﬁt to increase given
that missed sales are now only for the matte boards and thus cost only $510 per missed sale.
9.5 More than One Period in Which to Prepare
for the Selling Season
Particularly in a production context (e.g., style goods in the garment industry) there may be
an extended length of time (divided, for convenience, into several time periods) in which
replenishment commitments are made before the actual selling season begins. There are likely
to be production constraints on the total amounts that can be acquired in each time period. Fur-
thermore, forecasts of total demand are almost certain to change during these preseason periods,
perhaps as a consequence of ﬁrm customer orders being received. We would like to be able to
modify the decision rule of the previous section to cope with these new complexities eﬀectively.
Hausman and Peterson (1972) have shown that an “optimal” solution to the problem is out
of the question. However, they have proposed two heuristic decision rules that appear to perform
quite well, at least on the numerical examples tested. The heuristics are closely related to the single-
period procedure of Section 9.3, but allowance is made for production capability in all remaining
periods. Related references include Crowston et al. (1973), Bitran et al. (1986), Matsuo (1990),
Bradford and Sugrue (1990), and Fisher and Raman (1996). The latter paper allows for updating
of forecasts based on sales during the early part of the season and develops a heuristic solution.
Experience with a fashion apparel manufacturer is reported. See also Abillama and Singh (1996)
who model a situation in which the capacity to produce within a season is limited. Therefore,
production is started prior to the season, and any shortages of realized demand are produced if
capacity is available in season. They ﬁnd optimal order quantities for single and multiple products,
and describe a number of properties of the optimal solution.
9.6 Multiperiod Newsvendor Problem
In many cases, obsolescence occurs after several time periods, implying that more than one order
may be placed as the demand declines or simply evaporates. Section 8.5 of Chapter 8 discussed the
case of gradually declining demands and the sizing of the ﬁnal replenishment. We now introduce
literature that addresses the problem of a product that faces sudden obsolescence at some unknown
future time.
For multiperiod production/inventory problems, Ignall and Veinott (1969) have developed
conditions under which a relatively simple policy, known as a myopic policy, is optimal for the
sequence of periods. A myopic policy is one that selects the production quantities for the current
period to minimize expected costs in the current period alone. Obviously, a myopic policy is much
simpler to compute than is a more general multiperiod policy. However, the multiperiod style goods
problem discussed above does not satisfy the conditions for which a myopic policy is optimal.
Joglekar and Lee (1993) provide an exact formulation of the inventory costs for items with
deterministic demand that may face sudden obsolescence at an unknown future time. Jain and Sil-
ver (1994) generalize the problem somewhat by incorporating the potential for a longer lifetime.
At the end of each period, the remaining inventory either becomes worthless or is usable for at least
one more period. They use variations of the lot sizing heuristics introduced in Chapter 5 to solve

Style Goods and Perishable Items
■
409
the problem of how much to order each period. See also David and Mehrez (1995) who introduce
a problem in which all items become useless at once, but at a random time in the future. See also
Rosenﬁeld (1989).
Song and Zipkin (1990) develop a ﬂexible model that can analyze sudden obsolescence as well
as gradual declining demand when demand is probabilistic and is distributed as a Poisson random
variable. They show that in many cases, an inventory hump occurs. When goods are ordered prior
to the decline in demand, inventory reaches a level that is too high for the lower demand rate. It
takes some time to work oﬀthe excess inventory. Therefore, simple myopic policies can produce
signiﬁcant errors, as can simple adjustments to the inventory holding cost rate. (The latter approach
is commonly used. The carrying charge, r, is inﬂated to account for the possibility of obsolescence.)
Song and Zipkin show that inventory policies that explicitly account for obsolescence perform
much better than these heuristic methods. Unfortunately, these policies are not easy to compute for
most demand distributions. If disposal of stock is possible, the problem becomes somewhat more
manageable. Masters (1991), on the other hand, shows that the common approach of inﬂating
r is indeed optimal when demand is deterministic and the time to obsolescence is exponentially
distributed. See also Cobbaert and Van Oudheusden (1996).
Related work on multiperiod problems includes Liao and Yang (1994) and Kurawarwala and
Matsuo (1996).
9.7 Other Issues Relevant to the Control of Style Goods
In this section, we provide the highlights of other research that has been done related to the control
of style goods. For more detailed analyses, see the referenced literature at the end of this chapter.
9.7.1 Updating of Forecasts
This topic has been treated in Chapter 3, but we now reexamine those aspects of particular rele-
vance to the style goods problem. In a multiperiod problem, opportunities exist to update forecasts.
Several alternative methods exist, including
1. Exploitation of the properties of the forecasts made by decision makers. Hausman (1969) found
that under certain circumstances, ratios of successive forecasts turn out to be independent
variables with a speciﬁc form of probability distribution. Fisher et al. (1994b) discovered
that members of the buying committee of a fashion skiwear company tended to listen to
a few dominant members in developing estimates of the next season’s demand. When the
committee members independently forecasted demand, the average of the forecasts tended
to be much more accurate. See also Chambers and Eglese (1986), Fisher et al. (1994a), and
Fisher and Raman (1996).
2. Taking advantage of the observation that sales at the retail level tend to be proportional to inven-
tory displayed. Wolfe (1968) used this approach to revise forecasts based on demands observed
early in the selling period. See also Baker and Urban (1988), Bar-Lev et al. (1994), Kurawar-
wala and Matsuo (1996), Gerchak and Wang (1994), Urban (1995), Padmanabhan and Vrat
(1995), and Giri et al. (1996).
3. Simple extrapolation methods using a particular mathematical form for the cumulative sales as
a function of time. Hertz and Schaﬃr (1960) assumed a normal-shaped cumulative curve.
Gilding and Lock (1980), in the context of a furniture manufacturer, dealt with the case

410
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
of an artiﬁcial seasonality induced by sales promotions. They found that a Gompertz curve
provides a reasonable ﬁt to cumulative sales:
Yult = ln Yt + ae−bt
(9.24)
where
Yult = represents the ultimate (total) sales of the item
Yt = cumulative sales as of time t
and a and b are constants. See also Franses (1994).
4. Bayesian procedures. In the Bayesian approach, one or more parameters of the prob-
ability distribution of demand are assumed unknown. Prior knowledge is encoded in
the form of probability distributions over the possible values of these parameters. As
demands are observed in the early part of the season, these probability distributions
are appropriately modiﬁed to take account of the additional information. References
include Chang and Fyﬀe (1971), Murray and Silver (1966), Riter (1967), Harpaz et al.
(1982), Azoury (1985), Lovejoy (1990), Lariviere and Porteus (1999), and Eppen and
Iyer (1997b). Also, Fisher et al. (1994b) found that in the ﬁrm they studied, using infor-
mation from only the ﬁrst 20% of the season’s sales data signiﬁcantly improved forecast
accuracy.
5. Use of information about patterns of past product demand in conjunction with estimates of the
total life cycle sales of the current product. Managers can estimate the duration of the product life
cycle for a short cycle product based on the experiences with previous versions of the product.
Then estimates about total sales, the timing of peak sales (such as in December), and other
seasonal variations, can be added to develop speciﬁc forecasts of demand. Multiperiod varia-
tions of the newsvendor inventory model are then used to control inventory. See Kurawarwala
and Matsuo (1998, 1996), and Lau and Lau (1996a). See also Fisher et al. (1994b), who
advocated dividing items into those which are more predictable and those which are less pre-
dictable. Thus, productive capacity can be devoted to predictable items ﬁrst. The smaller
amounts of capacity available just before, or during, the season can be reserved for less
predictable items.
9.7.2 Reorders and Markdowns
Wolfe (1968), using the assumption about sales being proportional to the inventory level,
developed methods of determining each of the following:
1. The expected time TF to sell a fraction F of the initial inventory if a fraction f has been
sold by time t(f < F). A style can be tentatively identiﬁed as a fast mover (with associated
possible reorder) or slow mover (with associated possible markdown) depending on the value
of TF for a particular selected F value.
2. The associated order-up-to-level if a reorder is to be placed at a speciﬁc time.
3. The timing of a markdown as a function of the fraction of initial inventory sold to date, the
current price, the markdown price, the salvage value of leftover material, and the assumed
known ratio of the sales rate after the markdown to that before it.

Style Goods and Perishable Items
■
411
Feng and Gallego (1995) studied the problem assuming that there is a ﬁxed number of units
available for sale in a season. They determined when to lower or raise the price as a function
of the time until the end of the season, if there is but one chance to change the price. Based
on the number of items left, they provide a threshold time when the price should be changed.
Khouja (1995) shows that multiple markdowns provide higher expected proﬁt than a single
markdown. See also Carlson (1982a,b), Lau and Lau (1988); Arcelus and Rowcroft (1992),
and Khouja (1996).
9.7.3 Reserving Capacity Ahead of Time
It is common in the apparel industry for a ﬁrm to reserve some portion of the capacity of one
or several suppliers. One fashion-forward apparel ﬁrm we have worked with limits its activities to
designing garments and arranging to have them manufactured. All manufacturing and logistics is
performed by outside contractors. To ensure that enough production capacity is available to meet
peak-season demand, this ﬁrm agrees to buy a certain number of, say, sport coats from a supplier
over the year. Then, speciﬁc styles and colors are determined as the season approaches. Jain and
Silver (1995) examine this problem for an item with uncertainty in its demand and uncertainty
in the capacity of the supplier. Dedicated capacity can be ensured by paying a premium to the
supplier. The two decision variables are the replenishment quantity to request and the amount of
capacity to reserve. It turns out to be very easy to select the best value of the replenishment quantity.
On the other hand, they are only able to characterize the general behavior of the expected proﬁt as a
function of the level of dedicated capacity. See also Ciarallo et al. (1994), So and Song (1998), and
Costa and Silver (1996). In particular, the latter authors examine a multiperiod version of the Jain
and Silver (1995) paper. Bassok and Anupindi (1997) examined the case in which a commitment is
made to the supplier to buy a certain minimum quantity over a multiple period horizon. Anupindi
and Bassok (1995) studied the case in which the buyer provides a forecast but the supplier may
allow some ﬂexibility to deviate from the forecast. Eppen and Iyer (1997a) studied a similar system
in which the buyer orders a given number of items, but some are held back by the vendor. If the
buyer does not purchase these, a penalty is paid. If they are ordered, they can be purchased at the
original price. See also Tsay (1999) and Eppen and Iyer (1997b). Liao and Yang (1994) analyzed a
system in which more than one replenishment is triggered at once. Cachon (1999) studied a case
in which multiple buyers are forced to place their orders according to their supplier’s production
schedule so that the variability of demand experienced by the supplier is reduced. Nevertheless,
total supply chain costs increase, and the buyers end up incurring most of the higher cost.
9.7.4 Inventory Policies for Common Components
In a manufacturing ﬁrm that can assemble ﬁnished products to customer order, it is often desirable
to hold safety stock of components, rather than of end items. If the assembly time is short relative
to the lead time for purchasing or making components, and the value added at the assembly stage
is high, holding component inventory makes sense. In addition, if there is signiﬁcant commonality
among components, total safety stocks may be reduced by holding common components and
then assembling them to order. Component commonality refers to the situation in which certain
components are used to make more than one ﬁnished product.
A number of researchers have investigated the question of how much stock to hold when there
is component commonality. This literature has usually viewed the problem in a newsvendor context
because the long component lead time yields a single decision of how much component inventory

412
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
to order. A second-stage decision in the problem involves which ﬁnished products to assemble once
demand has been realized.
Dogramaci (1979) shows that component commonality can lower costs due to a reduction in
the forecast error. Baker (1985) shows how the typical relationship between the safety factor and
ﬁnished product service level is altered when the safety factor is chosen for common components.
Choosing a safety factor of components to satisfy, say, 90% of demand will not give a 90% service
level of ﬁnished products because the common components can be allocated to several products.
See also Bagchi and Gutierrez (1992).
Gerchak and Henig (1986) show that (1) the inventory of product-speciﬁc components always
increases when other components are combined into common parts and the objective is to maxi-
mize proﬁt; and (2) the inventory of the common components could increase, decrease, or stay the
same. They also show that the multiperiod problem satisﬁes the conditions for a myopic optimal
solution, so that qualitative insights from the newsvendor-type solutions hold in the more general
case. Gerchak et al. (1988) extend the analysis to the case in which there is a service-level require-
ment, and show that property (1) does not necessarily hold. See also Baker et al. (1986). When
there is a capacity or storage constraint, Gerchak and Henig (1989) show that property (1) again
may not hold. See also Jönsson and Silver (1989a,b), Jönsson et al. (1993).
Eynan and Rosenblatt (1996) relax a prevalent assumption that the common component has
the same cost as the product-speciﬁc components it replaces. They show that commonality may
not be desirable. See also Eynan and Rosenblatt (1997). Vakharia et al. (1996) illustrate how com-
monality may increase the disruption on the shop ﬂoor by increasing the variability of the load at
certain work centers.
Eynan and Rosenblatt (1995), in an interesting paper, compare an assemble-in-advance strategy
with an assemble-to-order strategy. If products are made in advance, additional holding costs may
be incurred, whereas if they are made to order, processing costs are higher. The authors give simple
newsvendor-type solutions for the optimal inventory levels. They also provide conditions under
which it is optimal to choose each strategy, or a combination of the two. See also Lee and Tang
(1997) and Moon and Choi (1997).
Srinivasan et al. (1992) develop approximations and an algorithm for a large-scale common-
ality problem at IBM. Other references on the commonality problem include Collier (1982),
McClain et al. (1984), Guerrero (1985), Baker (1988), Aneja and Singh (1990), Tsubone et
al. (1994), Agrawal and Cohen (2001), Balakrishnan et al. (1996), Eynan (1996), and Zhang
(1997).
9.7.5 Other Research
We now comment brieﬂy on other research pertaining to the general problem area of this chapter.
Gerchak and Mossman (1992) show that the optimal order quantity in the newsvendor problem
may actually increase when demand variability decreases. The order quantity increases as demand
variability increases if and only if
px≤(ˆx) <
cu
cu + co
which is often true. They show that, under quite general conditions, as uncertainty increases, the
order quantity always moves away from mean demand, and the optimal cost increases.
Additional research in this area includes Eeckhoudt et al. (1995) and Kim et al. (1995).

Style Goods and Perishable Items

9.8 Inventory Control of Perishable Items
In the earlier parts of the book, we have not explicitly dealt with perishability, other than possibly
through a rather crude adjustment of the inventory carrying charge. Perishability refers to the
physical deterioration of units of a product. Demand continues for further units of the item. In
contrast, when obsolescence occurs, there is negligible further demand for the SKU involved.
Perishable items can be divided into two categories, ﬁxed or random, depending on the lifetime
of a unit of the item. For items with a ﬁxed lifetime, the utility of each unit stays essentially constant
for a ﬁxed period of time, then drops appreciably (perhaps decreed by law). An example is blood
stored in blood banks. For items where the lifetime is a random variable, the utility can decrease
throughout the lifetime in a fashion that may or may not depend on the age of the unit involved
(examples include fresh produce, certain types of volatile chemicals, drugs, etc.). See Abdel-Malek
and Ziegler (1988).
For the ﬁxed lifetime case, Nahmias (1982) provides an extensive and excellent review of the
research on this topic. Here, we brieﬂy comment on the research since that time. Schmidt and Nah-
mias (1985) consider (S −1, S) inventory policies for ﬁxed lifetime items with Poisson demands,
and positive replenishment lead times. Ravichandran (1995) analyzes the same system using (s, S)
policies, and shows that it is extremely diﬃcult to analyze. Chiu (1995) allows for a positive replen-
ishment lead time and develops approximations for (s, Q) policies. See also Cohen et al. (1983)
and Kalpakam and Sapna (1996).
Most research that analyzes the random lifetime problem assumes that inventory on hand dete-
riorates at a constant rate. In other words, a constant fraction of inventory on hand becomes useless
each unit of time. Raafat (1991) reviews some of the literature in this area. Chung and Ting (1994)
investigate a system in which demand decreases linearly with time, and where a constant fraction of
items deteriorates each period. They develop a good heuristic for the amount of inventory to order.
(See also Kim 1995.) Hariga and Benkherouf (1994) expand the problem to include time-varying
demand. They employ heuristics like those presented in Chapter 5. Benkherouf (1995) presents
an optimal procedure for the case in which demand rates decrease over a known time horizon and
items deteriorate at a constant rate. See also Benkherouf and Mahmoud (1996) and Balkhi and
Benkherouf (1996). Aggarwal and Jaggi (1995) extend the analysis to allow for delayed payment
to the supplier. Kalpakam and Sapna (1994) analyze an (s, S) system with Poisson demands and
lifetimes that follow an exponential distribution. Lead times are positive and probabilistic as well.
They describe properties of the long-run expected cost. When demand is probabilistic, as in this
latter case, the analysis becomes extremely complicated. Rosenﬁeld (1989) examines the proba-
bilistic case when each item can perish at a random time. He determines the optimal amount of
inventory to dispose of when demands arrive according to a Poisson process and batch sizes are one
unit. See also Padmanabhan and Vrat (1995), Abad (1996), and Chapter 8 of this book.
In an interesting paper, Vaughn (1994) blends the ﬁxed lifetime and random lifetime literatures.
In his model, neither the vendor nor the customer can observe whether the item has deteriorated.
Therefore, the vendor assigns a “sell by” or “use by” date to each item. The useful life of the item is
a random variable, but the shelf life is deterministic and is given by the chosen “sell by” date. This
paper examines the interaction between the optimal order up to level S and the optimal “sell by”
date.
For most of this research, inventory is depleted according to a ﬁrst-in-ﬁrst-out (FIFO) policy;
that is, the oldest inventory is used ﬁrst. FIFO is an optimal issuing policy over a wide range
of assumptions, particularly where the issuing organization has complete control over the issuing
actions. However, where the customer makes the selection (e.g., in retail food distribution where

414
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
the expiration date is shown on each unit), a last-in-ﬁrst-out (LIFO) policy is likely to be observed.
See Pierskalla and Roach (1972) and Albright (1976).
9.9 Summary
In this chapter, we have presented some decision logic for coping with items subject to obsolescence
or perishability. In the style goods version of the problem, the logic exploited the property of not
being able (for economic reasons) to carry stock over from one selling season to the next. With this
chapter, we have completed our coverage of individual-item inventory management.
Problems
9.1
Alexander Norman owns several retail fur stores in a large North American city. In the
spring of each year, he must decide on the number of each type of fur coat to order from
his manufacturing supplier for the upcoming winter season. For a particular muskrat line,
his cost per coat is $150 and the retail selling price is $210. He estimates an average sales
of 100 coats but with considerable uncertainty, which he is willing to express as a uniform
distribution between 75 and 125. Any coat not sold at the end of the winter can be disposed
of at cost ($150) to a discount house. However, Norman feels that on any such coat he
has lost money because of the capital tied up in the inventory for the whole season. He
estimates a loss of $0.15 for every dollar tied up in a coat that must be sold oﬀat the end of
the season.
a. How many coats should he order?
b. One of the factors contributing to the uncertainty in sales is the unknown level of retail
luxury tax on coats that will be established by the government early in the fall. Norman
has connections in the government and manages to learn the tax level prior to his buying
decision. This changes his probability distribution to a normal form with a mean of 110

Neighborhood Hardware Ltd. acts as a central buying agent and distributor for a large
number of retail hardware outlets in Canada. The product line is divided into six major
categories, with a diﬀerent buyer being responsible for each single category. One category
is miscellaneous equipment for outdoor work around the home. The buyer for this group,
Mr. Harry Lock, seeks assistance from a recently hired analyst, J. D. Smith, in the computer
division of the company. In particular, he is concerned with the acquisition of a particular
type of small snowblower that must be ordered several months before the winter. Smith,
after considerable discussions with Lock, has the latter’s agreement with the following
data:
Unit acquisition cost is $60.00/unit
Selling price is $100.00/unit

Suppose the supplier in Problem 9.3 oﬀers a discount such that the unit cost is $55 if

In reality, Mr. Lock of Neighborhood Hardware has to order three diﬀerent snowblowers
from the same supplier. He tells the analyst, Smith, that he will go along with his normal
model (whatever that is!) but, in no event, will he allocate more than $70,000 for the acqui-

Consider a sporting goods company that carries ski equipment in stores across Canada.
Because of unusual weather conditions 1 year, near the end of the ski season, the company
ﬁnds itself with a surplus of ski equipment in the West and with not enough on hand
in the East to meet the demand. At a meeting of marketing managers a person from the
East requests that the surplus goods in the West be rush-shipped to the East. On the other
hand, a Western manager suggests a discount sale there to get rid of the stock. In an eﬀort

Mr. Jones, a recent MBA graduate, the only entrepreneur in his graduating class, will estab-
lish a distinctive newspaper concession on the corner of two busy streets near his alma mater.
After conducting in-depth interviews, he has decided to stock three daily newspapers: the
Hong Kong Chronicle, the New York Times, and the Barrie Bugle. Having successfully avoided
all courses requiring arithmetic during his academic career, he has contacted you to advise
him on the kind of ordering policy that he should follow.
a. You ﬁrst make the assumption that the daily demand for each of the three papers is
normally distributed. The mean number of papers sold during the ﬁrst 4 days of the
week appears to be 50% greater than on Fridays and Saturdays. Mr. Jones has a small
kiosk (acquired through a student loan from the bank) that can stock only 500 papers
each day. In keeping with analytic modeling tradition, you assume, for mathematical
convenience, that the cost of being short of any of the three papers on any particular day
is $0.06 and the cost of not selling a paper on any particular day is $0.02. Recommend
inventory stocking rules for Mr. Jones.
b. Illustrate with the following numerical example for a typical Tuesday:

the shortcomings of the numerical example and ordering policy above. Criticize your
answers to (a) and (b) in light of reality.
d. How would you ascertain whether it was worthwhile for Jones to go deeper into debt
to buy a larger kiosk (capable of holding 1,000 copies)?

A local vendor of newspapers feels that dissatisfaction of customers leads to future lost sales.
In fact, she feels that the average demand for a particular newspaper is related to the service
level as follows:
ˆx = 1,000 + 500P
where ˆx is the average demand in copies/period and P is the fraction of demand that
is satisﬁed. Demands are normally distributed and the standard deviation (per period)
is equal to 200, independent of the service level. Other (possibly) relevant factors
are:
Fixed cost per day to get any papers in = $2
Cost per paper (for vendor) = $0.07
Selling price per paper = $0.15
Salvage value per paper = $0.02
a. Ignoring the eﬀect of disservice on demand, what is the best number of papers to acquire
per period?
b. Taking account of the eﬀect, now what is the best number to acquire?
c. What average proﬁt is the vendor losing if she proceeds as in (a) instead of as
in (b)?

The Food Services Department of a large university is concerned with the decision mak-
ing related to the purchase of bread for use in the cafeterias of the university. The daily
demand can be assumed to be uniformly distributed between 20 and 60 loaves. There are
20 slices in a loaf of bread and the selling price is $0.04 per slice. Any demand for bread
when there is none on hand is lost but there is no associated loss of goodwill, etc. Any
bread left over at the end of a day is used as ingredients for cooking (e.g., in bread pud-
ding, stuﬃng, etc.). The value of such use is estimated to be $0.05 per loaf. The supplier,
Easton Bakeries, in an eﬀort to induce high consumption oﬀers a discount structure as
follows:
Cost per loaf for ﬁrst 50 loaves = $0.30
Cost per any loaf over 50 loaves = $0.20
The ﬁxed cost of a procurement from the bakery = $5.00
a. Show the expected daily proﬁt as a function of the number of loaves of bread ordered
per day.
b. What quantity of bread should be purchased per day?
c. Outline how you would determine the daily loss in proﬁt (compared with the optimal
strategy) that would result if the university simply ordered the expected demand?

In the text, we discussed the basic newsvendor problem where there is but a single ordering
opportunity per selling period (day). In fact, we assumed that the order had to be placed
prior to the actual selling period (day). Let us now consider the following modiﬁed version
of the problem. After all the demand is known for a particular day, the newsvendor has an
additional opportunity to order any copies that he still needs above and beyond what he
ordered prior to the day. These new copies arrive quickly enough to satisfy customers, thus
avoiding lost sales and any loss of good will. Let
v1 = unit acquisition cost for copies ordered prior to the day in question (i.e., by the
usual assumed method), $/copy
v2 = unit acquisition cost for the emergency additional order, $/copy
Assume g < v1 < v2 < p where
g is the unit salvage value, $/copy and
p is the selling price, $/copy

A manufacturer of summer style goods has two opportunities to make replenishments. The
ﬁrst opportunity, at a unit cost v1, is during the previous winter when very little in the
way of ﬁrm orders have yet been received. The second opportunity, at unit cost v2 (where
v2 > v1), is in the early spring after a (random) number x of ﬁrm orders have been received.
The ultimate total number of units demanded is denoted by y, and x and y have a joint
probability density function fx,y(x0, y0). The selling price per unit is p and any units left can
be scrapped at a unit value of g. Let Q1 be the quantity produced in the winter and Q2 be
the quantity produced in the spring.

the assistance of Professor William F. Jennings of the Department of Industrial Engineer-
ing who has some familiarity with inventory models. Jennings ascertains from Gold that
historically there has been considerable variance between the number of books that Dunphy
says he needs for a course and the actual number purchased by the students. The particular
text under consideration is supplied by a publisher that allows up to 20% returns from the
bookstore, with the latter only incurring the shipping costs (i.e., the wholesale purchase
price is completely refunded). To illustrate, up to 20 copies could be handled in this fashion
if the original order was for 100 copies. No refund is possible on any amount beyond the
20%. Gold indicates that any copies that could not be returned would be marked down to

Consider a perishable commodity that is outdated in exactly three basic periods. Suppose
that an ordering decision is made at the beginning of each period and the replenishment
arrives instantaneously. An order-up-to-level (R, S) system is used. The perishability of the
item means that any units procured at the start of period t and still on-hand at the end of
period t +2 must be discarded. Any demand not satisﬁed is lost (i.e., there is no backorder-
ing). Simulate the behavior of such a system for 20 periods assuming S = 30 units and the
demand in the 20 consecutive periods are 11, 9, 3, 4, 14, 11, 7, 9, 11, 10, 12, 15, 8, 11, 8,

a. Inventory carried forward to the next period

The demand for a particular spare part appears to be decreasing rapidly. Any demand occurs
only in the month of December each year. Because of warranty considerations, the company
has guaranteed the availability of spare parts through to (and including) the 2017 year.
The inventory of the item in mid-November 2016 is 10 units. The demands in December
2016 and December 2017 are assumed to be independent random variables x and y with

There is a setup cost of $50 associated with producing any units of the item. The
unit variable cost of a produced piece is $20/unit and it costs $4.50 to carry each unit
in inventory from December 2016 to December 2017. In any month of December when
the total demand exceeds the stock available, additional spare parts are purchased from a
competitor at a cost in dollars of 60 + 35z, where z is the number of units purchased (i.e.,
the size of the shortage). Any unit left over at the end of December 2017 will have a salvage
value of $5/unit. Production each year must take place before the December demand is
known.

9A.1 Basic Newsvendor Results
9A.1.1 Profit Maximization
Each unit purchased costs v, each unit sold produces a revenue of p, each unit disposed as salvage
gives a revenue of g, and there is an additional cost B associated with each unit of demand not
satisﬁed. If a quantity Q is stocked and a demand x0 occurs, the proﬁt is
P(Q, x0) =

if x0 ≤Q

where ES is the expected number of units short. This is Equation 9.3.*
We can also represent Equation 9A.2 as perfect information proﬁt minus demand–supply mis-
match costs. To do this, we use the following relationship between expected units short ES and
expected units left over which we denote EO.

ˆx −ES + EO

−(p −g + B)ES
= (p −v)ˆx −(v −g)EO −(p −v + B)ES
(9A.3)
Equation 9A.3 is then the proﬁt under perfect information (the per unit margin, p −v, times the
expected demand) minus the per unit overage cost (unit cost minus salvage value) times expected
units left over, and underage cost (per unit margin p −v plus the penalty cost B) times expected
units short.

tial demands. As shown in Appendix II for the normal distribution, ES = σxGu

To ﬁnd the maximizing value of Q, we set
dE[P(Q)]
dQ

(9A.4)
By applying Leibnitz’s rule,* we get dES
dQ = px<(Q) −1, so that

or
px<(Q) = p −v + B

The expected proﬁt at the optimal value of Q is found by substituting the right-hand side of
Equation 9A.4 into the expected proﬁt function:

Now we show the derivation of Equation 9.9. Equation 9.8 is
E[P(Q)] = (p −g)ˆx −(v −g)Q −(p −g + B)σxGu
Q −ˆx
σx

Using the expression for Gu(k) = [fu(k) −kpu≥(k)] from Appendix II and the expression from
Equation 9A.8, we obtain
E[P(Q)] = (p −g)ˆx −(v −g)(ˆx + kσx) −(p −g + B)σx[fu(k) −kpu≥(k)]
= (p −g)ˆx −(v −g)ˆx −(v −g)kσx −(p −g + B)σxfu(k) + (p −g + B)kσxpu≥(k)
= (p −v)ˆx −(v −g)kσx −(p −g + B)σxfu(k) + (p −g + B)kσx

v −g
p −g + B

= (p −v)ˆx −(v −g)kσx −(p −g + B)σxfu(k) + (v −g)kσx
= (p −v)ˆx −(p −g + B)σxfu(k)

9A.1.3 Discrete Case
The expected total cost in the discrete case is
ETC(Q) =
Q−1

x0=0
c0(Q −x0)px(x0) +
∞

x0=Q
cu(x0 −Q)px(x0)
(9A.9)
where
px(x0) = Pr{x = x0}
Let
ETC(Q) = ETC(Q + 1) −ETC(Q)
(9A.10)
Then, ETC(Q) is the change in expected total cost when we switch from Q to Q + 1. For a
convex cost function (the case here), the best Q (or one of the best Q values) will be the lowest Q
where ETC(Q) is greater than zero. Therefore, we select the smallest Q for which
ETC(Q) > 0
(9A.11)
Substituting from Equations 9A.9 and 9A.10 leads, after considerable simpliﬁcation, to Equa-
tion 9.10.
9A.2 Constrained Multi-Item Situation
The problem is to select the Qi’s (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) to maximize
n

i=1
E[P(Qi)]
subject to
n

i=1
Qivi = W
(9A.12)
where, from Equation 9A.2
E[P(Qi)] = −Qivi +
Qi
0
[pix0 + gi(Qi −x0)]ifx(x0)dx0
+
∞
Qi
[piQi −Bi(x0 −Qi)]ifx(x0)dx0
(9A.13)
Equation 9A.13 and
ifx(x0)dx0 = Pr{Total demand for product i lies between x0 and x0 + dx0}

Style Goods and Perishable Items

The Lagrangian approach (see Appendix I) is to select the multiplier M and Qi’s to maximize
L(Qi’s, M) =
n

i=1
E[P(Qi)] −M
# n

i=1
Qivi −W
$
(9A.14)
This is accomplished by setting partial derivatives to zero. Setting the partial derivative with respect
to M equal to zero simply produces Equation 9A.12, implying that an optimal solution must
exactly consume the budget W .
Substituting Equation 9A.13 into Equation 9A.14, we have
L(Qi’s, M) =
n

i=1
(−Qivi + I1 + I2) −M
# n

i=1
Qivi −W
$
(9A.15)
where I1 and I2 are the two integrals in Equation 9A.13. The key point is that I1 and I2 do not
involve the vi’s.
Now Equation 9A.15 can be rewritten as
L(Qi’s, M) =
n

i=1
[−Qi(M + 1)vi + I1 + I2] + MW
The expression in square brackets is the same as E[P(Qi)], except that vi is replaced by (M + 1)vi.
Therefore, when we set
∂L
∂Qi
= 0
we obtain the same result as the independent Q∗for item i except that vi is replaced by (M +1)vi;
that is, select Qi to satisfy
ipx<(Qi) = pi −(M + 1)vi + Bi
pi −gi + Bi
(9A.16)
A given value of M implies a value for each Qi which in turn implies a value of
n

i=1
Qivi
Equation 9A.16 shows that the higher the value of M, the lower must be ipx<(Qi), that is, the
lower must be Qi.

IV
MANAGING
INVENTORY ACROSS
MULTIPLE LOCATIONS
AND MULTIPLE FIRMS
In Sections II and III, we have been primarily concerned with the control of individual items
at a single location. With just a few exceptions, which addressed the aggregate consequences of a
particular decision rule, the rules and systems developed have treated the individual items and loca-
tions in isolation. In Section IV, we now explicitly consider coordinated control of both items and
locations, generally in nonproduction situations. There are three important contexts where such
coordination often leads to substantial cost savings. First, in Chapter 10, we deal with a single stock-
ing point (as in Chapters 4 through 9) but now consider coordination of replenishments of a group
of items to reduce costs. Such coordination makes sense if one of the following conditions occurs:
1. Several items are purchased from the same supplier.
2. Several items share the same mode of transportation.
3. Several items are produced on the same piece of equipment.
The bulk of this chapter focuses on nonproduction situations, but we do provide a substantial
treatment of one particular production situation.
Chapter 11 deals with the second context where coordination can lead to appreciable cost
savings—multiechelon inventory within the same ﬁrm. Material is stored at more than one geo-
graphic location, and one must account for the possibility that the supplying location is short
of stock when an order is placed. It is clear that decisions concerning the same item at diﬀerent
locations should not be made independently.
Chapter 12 addresses the third context—managing inventories across the supply chain. This
topic shares many of the complexities of the multiechelon situation, except that we are now also
dealing with the coordination of multiple ﬁrms across the supply chain.
Because of these coordination issues, exact analyses are an order of magnitude more complex
than those of earlier chapters. Therefore, we are frequently forced to resort to heuristic decision
rules. In Chapters 13 through 16, we address coordination issues within production environments.


Chapter 10
Coordinated Replenishments
at a Single Stocking Point
In this chapter, we address an important situation in which it makes sense to coordinate the control
of diﬀerent stock-keeping units. Speciﬁcally, the items are all stocked at the same location and
they share a common supplier or mode of transportation. Alternatively, they share a common
production facility. In the latter case, there is the added complexity of a ﬁnite productive capacity
to be shared each period. Conceptually, the items to be coordinated could be the same item at
diﬀerent, parallel locations. We emphasize the word parallel because coordination in a multiechelon
(serial) situation (one location feeding stock into another) is quite diﬀerent. The latter situation
will be addressed in Chapter 11.
As we will see in Section 10.1, there are several possible advantages in coordinating the replen-
ishments or production of a group of items. The potential disadvantages will also be discussed.
In Section 10.2, for the case of deterministic demand, the economic order quantity analysis of
Chapter 4 (which there assumed independent control of items) is extended to the situation where
there is a major ﬁxed (setup) cost associated with a replenishment of a family of coordinated items
and a minor ﬁxed (setup) cost for each item involved in the particular replenishment. Section 10.3
extends the quantity discount arguments of Chapter 4 to the case where the discount is based
on the magnitude of the total replenishment of a group of items—for example, a freight rate
reduction if a carload size replenishment is achieved. Then, in Section 10.4, we discuss the com-
plexity of the situation in which items are to be coordinated but demand is probabilistic and
there are no quantity discounts. In Section 10.5, we deal with the situation where group dis-
counts are of paramount importance so that, when a group order is placed, we normally strive
to achieve a certain overall size (or dollar value) of order. Section 10.6 moves on to the pro-
duction environment in which there may be a capacity constraint. In this section, we discuss
both deterministic and probabilistic demand, as well as constant and time-varying demand. It
should be noted that in the literature the terminology joint replenishment is sometimes used in
lieu of coordinated replenishment. Finally, in Section 10.7, we brieﬂy discuss the related problem of
shipment consolidation.

Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
10.1 Advantages and Disadvantages of Coordination
There are a number of reasons for coordinating items when making replenishment decisions. These
include the following:
1. Savings on unit purchase costs: When a group of items is ordered from the same vendor, a
quantity discount in purchase cost may be realized if the total order is greater than some
breakpoint quantity. It may be uneconomical to order this much of a single item, but it
could certainly make sense to coordinate several items to achieve a total order size as large as
the breakpoint. For example, a distributor incurs a ﬁxed cost for negotiating a replenishment
order from her supplier. Adding a line item to the order, however, incurs a smaller ﬁxed cost.
In some cases, a vendor-imposed minimum order quantity may dictate the same sort of joint
consideration. One book publisher is required by its printer to order at least four products
together. And the printer produces in only three quantities: 5,000, 10,000, or 15,000.
2. Savings on unit transportation costs: The discussion is basically the same as above. Now, group-
ing individual item orders may be advisable to achieve a quantity such as a carload or a
container load on a ship. Malden Mills was a textile ﬁrm that invented Polar Fleece, a unique
fabric used in outdoor jackets and other items. One of our students examined shipping
policies and costs as a summer project. It turns out that, because of signiﬁcant discounts,
shipments from their Massachusetts factory to Europe were always created to completely ﬁll
a shipping container for the ocean voyage.
3. Savings on ordering costs: In some cases, where the ﬁxed (setup) cost of placing a replenish-
ment order is high, it might make sense to put several items on a single order to reduce the
annual total of these ﬁxed costs. This is particularly relevant where the replenishment is by
in-house production. In such a case, the major component of the ﬁxed ordering cost is the
manufacturing setup cost. An illustration would be bottling beer products. There are major
changeover costs in converting the production line from one quality of beer to another. In
contrast, the costs of changing from one container type to another are rather minor.
4. Ease of scheduling: Coordinated handling of a vendor group can facilitate scheduling of buyer
time, receiving and inspection workload, and so forth. In fact, we have found that, by and
large, managers and purchasing agents alike tend to think and deal in terms of vendors or
suppliers rather than individual stock-keeping units.
On the other hand, there are possible disadvantages of using coordinated replenishment
procedures. These include the following:
1. A possible increase in the average inventory level: When items are coordinated, some will be
reordered earlier than if they were treated independently.
2. An increase in system control costs: By the very nature of the problem, coordinated control is
more complex than independent control of individual items. Therefore, under coordinated
control, review costs, computation costs, and so on are likely to be higher.
3. Reduced ﬂexibility: Not being able to work with items independently reduces ﬂexibility in
dealing with unusual situations. One possible result is reduced stability of customer service
on an individual-item basis.

10.2 Deterministic Case: Selection of Replenishment Quantities
in a Family of Items
In this section, we consider the case where there is a family of coordinated items deﬁned in the
following manner. There is a major setup cost (A) associated with a replenishment of the family.
In the procurement context, this is the ﬁxed (or header) cost of placing an order, independent of
the number of distinct items involved in the order. In the production environment, this is the
changeover cost associated with converting the facility from the production of some other fam-
ily to production within the family of interest. Then there is a minor setup cost (ai) associated
with including item i in a replenishment of the family. In the procurement context, ai is often
called the line cost, the cost of adding one more item or line to the requisition. From a produc-
tion standpoint, ai represents the relatively minor cost of switching to production of item i from
production of some other item within the same family. In general, we are concerned with items
sharing capacity, such as a container on a ship or a piece of production equipment, or with items
sharing costs, such as a major ﬁxed ordering cost. For a review of the literature on deterministic
and probabilistic models, see Goyal and Satir (1989); Van Eijs (1993), and Khouja and Goyal
(2008).*
10.2.1 Assumptions
All of the assumptions behind the derivation of the economic order quantity (Section 4.1 of Chap-
ter 4) are retained except that now coordination of items is allowed in an eﬀort to reduce setup
costs. We review the assumptions:
1. The demand rate of each item is constant and deterministic (this deterministic assumption
will be relaxed in Sections 10.4 through 10.6).†
2. The replenishment quantity of an item need not be an integral number of units (the extension
to integral units is as discussed for a single item in Chapter 4).
3. The unit variable cost of any of the items does not depend on the quantity; in particular,
there are no discounts in either the unit purchase cost or the unit transportation cost (we will
relax this assumption in Section 10.3).
4. The replenishment lead time is of zero duration, but the extension to a ﬁxed, known, nonzero
duration, independent of the magnitude of the replenishment, is straightforward.
5. No shortages are allowed (Sections 10.4 through 10.6 will deal with the situation where
shortages can occur).
6. The entire order quantity is delivered at the same time.
* For a related problem of ﬁnding groups of raw materials that should be ordered together, see Rosenblatt and
Finger (1983); Chakravarty (1984); Rosenblatt and Kaspi (1985); Chakravarty and Martin (1988); Van Eijs et al.
(1992); Hong and Hayya (1992); and Dekker et al. (1997).
† The situation of time-varying but deterministic demand patterns with no capacity constraint (as was the case in
Chapter 5) has been analyzed by Kao (1979) See Section 10.6.2 for the case with a capacity constraint.

10.2.2 Decision Rule
In the independent EOQ analysis of Chapter 4, we showed that the EOQ expressed as a time
supply was given by
TEOQ =

2A
Dvr
Note that TEOQ increases as the ratio A/Dv increases. Within our present context, this indicates
that an item i with a high setup cost ai and a low dollar usage rate Divi should probably be
replenished less frequently (higher time supply) than an item j having a low aj and a high Djvj.
Because of the assumptions of deterministic demand, no shortages permitted, and instantaneous
delivery, it makes sense to include an item in a replenishment only when its inventory drops to
the zero level. Therefore, a reasonable type of policy to consider is the use of a time interval (T)
between replenishments of the family and a set of mi’s, where mi, an integer, is the number of T
intervals that the replenishment quantity of item i will last. That is, item i will be included in every
mith replenishment of the family.* For example, if m17 = 3, item 17 will only be included in every
third replenishment of the family, with a replenishment quantity suﬃcient to last a time interval of
duration 3T. Each time it will be replenished just as its stock hits the zero level. We wish to select
the values of T and the mi’s to keep the total relevant costs as low as possible.
Figure 10.1 contains a more detailed example. Items 1 and 3 are ordered every time an order is
placed (i.e., m1 and m3 = 1). Item 2 is ordered every other time, so that m2 = 2.
As shown in the Appendix of this chapter, the integer mi’s must be selected to minimize

where

Di = demand rate of item i, in units/unit time
vi = unit variable cost of item i, in $/unit
n = number of items in the family (the items are numbered 1, 2, 3, . . . , n −1, n)
mi = the integer number of T intervals that the replenishment quantity of item i will last
Also, once the best mi’s are known, the corresponding value of T is given by
T ∗(m1, . . . . , mn) =

2(A +  ai/mi)
r  miDivi
(10.2)
* Jackson et al. (1985) have developed an eﬃcient procedure for the more restrictive situation where mi = 1, 2, 4, 8,
etc. (i.e., a multiple of 2) and T itself is also such a multiple of some basic time period (such as a day or a week).
This type of restriction is commonly found in practice. Moreover, Jackson et al. (1985) have shown that their
solution is, at most, 6% costlier than the “optimal” solution to the problem. We do not present the details here
since their solution is more diﬃcult conceptually than is ours. See also Roundy (1985, 1986); Atkins and Iyogun
(1987); Jackson (1988); Zoller (1990); Atkins (1991); Atkins and Sun (1995), and Section 10.4 where we return
to the “powers-of-two” solution. Klein and Ventura (1995) present a simple procedure for ﬁnding the optimal
cycle times if T is restricted to take on one of a set of possible discrete values.

It is worth noting that r does not appear in Equation 10.1; that is, the best values of the mi’s
do not depend on the carrying charge.
Goyal (1974) has proposed a search procedure for ﬁnding the best set of mi’s. (See related
research by Naddor (1975); Chakravarty (1985); Bastian (1986); Goyal (1988); Kaspi and Rosen-
blatt (1991); Goyal and Deshmukh (1993); Van Eijs (1993); Hariga (1994); and Viswanathan
and Goyal (1997). Khouja and Goyal (2008) provides an excellent overview of this early as well
as discussing more recent work.) We suggest, instead, the use of the following much simpler
(noniterative) procedure which is derived in the Appendix of this chapter:
Step 1 Number the items such that
ai

is smallest for item 1. Set m1 = 1.
Step 2 Evaluate
mi =

Step 3 Evaluate T ∗using the mi’s of Step 2 in Equation 10.2.
Step 4 Determine
Qivi = miDiviT ∗
i = 1, 2, . . . , n
(10.4)
In numerous tests (see Silver 1975), this procedure has produced results at or near the best possible
solution. Note, however, that the results are not always optimal because the mi values are rounded.

10.2.2.1 Numerical Illustration
A plant uses the same machinery to place three diﬀerent liquids into assorted container sizes. One
of these liquids (known as product XSC) is packaged in four diﬀerent sized containers: 1, 5, 10,
and 50 liters. The major setup cost to convert to this type of liquid is estimated to be $40. It
costs $15 to switch from one container size to another. The demand rates of this family of items
are shown in Table 10.1. The carrying charge has been established as 0.24 $/$/year. Moreover,
there is substantial excess capacity in the packaging operation, so it is reasonable to ignore capacity
considerations.

With Step 4, we obtain the run quantities
Q1v1 = (1)(86,000)(0.0762) = $6,550 (run quantity in dollars of 10-liter container)
Q2v2 = (1)(12,500)(0.0762) ≈$950

10.2.3 A Bound on the Cost Penalty of the Heuristic Solution
By deﬁnition, a heuristic solution is not guaranteed to give a solution with a low cost penalty.
Fortunately for this problem, it is possible, as shown in the Appendix of this chapter, to ﬁnd a
simple lower bound for the cost of the best (T, mi’s) policy, namely,
TRCbound =

2(A + a1)D1v1r +
n

j=2

2ajDjvjr
(10.5)
There is an interesting interpretation of the bound when we remember that an optimal policy must
have item 1 included in every replenishment of the family. The ﬁrst term is the total relevant cost
per unit time of an EOQ strategy (see Equation 4.5 of Chapter 4) for item 1 considered alone, if
we associate the full cost A + a1 with each replenishment of item 1. The second term represents a
summation of the total relevant costs per unit time of an EOQ strategy of each of the other items,
where a cost of only aj is associated with a replenishment of item j(j ̸= 1).
For our numerical illustration, the value of this bound works out to be $2,054.15/year. As
shown in the Appendix of this chapter, the cost of any (T, mi’s) solution is given by
TRC(T, mi′s) = A + n
i=1 ai/mi
T
+
n

i=1
DimiTvir

(10.6)
The solution developed by the heuristic has a cost of $2,067.65/year (evaluated by substituting
the integer mi values, found by the heuristic, into Equation 10.6). The bound clearly indi-
cates that the heuristic solution is very close to (if not right at) the optimum for the particular
example.
10.3 Deterministic Case with Group Discounts
As mentioned earlier, unit price or freight rate discounts may be oﬀered on the total dollar value
or the total volume of a replenishment made up of several items (e.g., the use of containers for
shipments from Massachusetts to Europe). The inventory control manager would like to ascertain
when to take advantage of such a discount. Therefore, knowing the discount structure, the major
setup cost (A) of a group of items, the item characteristics (ai’s, Di’s, and vi’s), and the carrying
charge (r), we want to develop decision logic for selecting the appropriate individual order quanti-
ties. The sum of the individual quantities totals a group quantity that determines whether or not
a particular discount is achieved. We mention that sometimes discount structures are designed for
much smaller customers than the organization under consideration. In such cases, discounts can be
achieved by individual-item orders so that the more complex coordinated control is not necessarily
needed.

444
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
As in the case of a single item, treated in Chapter 4, taking advantage of an oﬀered discount
reduces the replenishment costs (both the ﬁxed and unit costs) but increases the inventory carrying
costs. At ﬁrst glance, it would appear that the analysis for multiple items should not be much
more diﬃcult than that for a single item. This would be the case if every item was included in
every replenishment. However, we know from the preceding section that an mi > 1 is likely for
an item having a high value of ai/Divi; that is, such items should not necessarily be included in
every replenishment, even to help achieve a quantity discount level. Therefore, it is conceivable
that the best strategy might be one where on certain replenishments a discount was achieved, while
on others it was not (even though all demand rates are assumed known and at constant levels).
The analysis of such a strategy would be quite complex because the replenishment cycles would no
longer all be of the same duration, T (the ones where quantity discounts were achieved would be
longer than the others). Rather than attempting to explicitly model such complex possibilities, we
suggest the following reasonable compromise solution (illustrated for the case of a single possible
discount based on the total replenishment size, in units).
Our approach parallels that used in Section 4.5 of Chapter 4. We consider three possible solu-
tions. The ﬁrst (and if it is feasible, it is the best to use) is where a coordinated analysis, assuming
a quantity discount, leads to total replenishment quantities that are always suﬃcient to achieve
the discount. The second case is where the best result is achieved right at the breakpoint. Finally,
the third possibility is the coordinated solution without a quantity discount. Therefore, ﬁrst, the
method of Section 10.2 is used to ascertain the mi’s and T, assuming that the discount is achieved.
The smallest* replenishment quantity is computed and compared with the breakpoint quantity
(Qb) required. If it exceeds Qb, we use the mi’s and T developed. If it is less than Qb, then we
must compare the cost of the best solution without a discount to the cost of the solution where the
smallest replenishment quantity is right at the breakpoint. Whichever of these has the lower cost
is then the solution to use. The steps are presented using a discount based on the total number of
units ordered, while the numerical illustration that follows uses a dollar value discount. The details
are as follows:
Step 1 Compute the mi’s and T as in Section 10.2 but assuming that each
vi = v0i(1 −d)
where
v0i = basic unit cost of item i without a discount
d = fractional discount when the total replenishment equals or exceeds the breakpoint
quantity Qb
It should be noted that the set of mi’s does not depend on the size of the discount as long as
the unit cost of each item is reduced by the same percentage discount (which is typically the
* What we are assuming here is that if a discount is to be achieved, it must be achieved by every replenishment; that
is, we are ignoring the more complex possibility of achieving a discount on only some of the replenishments. The
smallest replenishments are those where only the items with mi = 1 are included. Lu (1995) develops a heuristic
method for ﬁnding the order quantities when it is possible to take the discount on some replenishments and not
on others. They ﬁnd that this additional ﬂexibility can yield signiﬁcant savings. See also Russell and Krajewski
(1992); Sadrian and Yoon (1992, 1994); Katz et al. (1994); and Xu et al. (2000).

case). This can be seen from Equation 10.3, where, if we use vi = v0i(1 −d) for all i, the
(1 −d) terms in the numerator and denominator cancel.
Compute the size of the smallest family replenishment
Qsm = (Summation of order quantities of all items having mi = 1)
(10.7)
If Qsm ≥Qb, use the mi’s, T, and Qi’s found above. If not, proceed to Step 2.
Step 2 Scale up the family cycle time T (found in Step 1) until the smallest replenishment size
equals the quantity breakpoint. This is achieved at
Tb =
Qb
Summation of Di of all items having mi = 1
(10.8)
The mi’s found in Step 1 are maintained. The cost of this breakpoint solution is evaluated
using the following total relevant cost expression:

(10.9)
Step 3 Use the procedure of Section 10.2 to ﬁnd the mi’s, T, and Qi’s without a discount (as
mentioned earlier, the best mi’s here must be the same as those found in Step 1). As shown in
the Appendix of this chapter, the total relevant costs of this solution are given by a somewhat
simpler expression than Equation 10.9, namely,

Step 4 Compare the TRC values found in Steps 2 and 3 and use the mi’s, T, and Qi’s associated
with the lower of these. If the solution right at the breakpoint is used, care must be taken
(because of the likely required integer nature of the Q’s) to ensure that the breakpoint is
actually achieved. Adjustment of one or more Q values to the next higher integers may be
necessary.
Prior to showing a numerical illustration of the above procedure, we make a few remarks related
to the work of Schneider (1982), which was developed in the context of the food distribution
industry. Speciﬁcally, he incorporates the idea of a modular order quantity (MOQ) for each item.
Then, anytime the item is ordered, the size of the order must be an integer multiple of MOQ.
Furthermore, recognizing that demand is probabilistic, he presents an approximation for the aver-
age inventory level of each item as a function of MOQ, the item’s demand rate, and the vendor
order quantity (the breakpoint). This permits the selection of the best MOQ for each possible
breakpoint so that the various breakpoint solutions can be costed out. Other research in this area
includes Chakravarty (1985).

Consider three parts, EDS-031, EDS-032, and EDS-033, used in the assembly of a stabilization
processor. These three products are purchased from the same domestic supplier who oﬀers a dis-
count of 5% if the value of the total replenishment quantity is at least $600. We use $1.50 as the
basic cost of placing an order with one item involved. The inclusion of each additional item costs
$0.50. It therefore follows that
A = $1.50 −$0.50 = $1.00
and
ai = $0.50

An r value of 0.24 $/$/year is to be used and the Di’s and v0i’s are shown in columns 1 and 2 of

Qsm in dollars = 275 + 110 = $385
which is below the quantity breakpoint of $600. Therefore, we proceed to Step 2. The use of
Equation 10.8, suitably modiﬁed because the breakpoint is expressed in dollars, gives
Tb =
$600
$6,000/year + $2,400/year = 0.07143 year
The cost of the breakpoint solution is from Equation 10.9:
TRC(Tb, mi′s) = 0.95(8,470) + 1.00 + 0.50 + 0.50 + 0.10
0.07143
+ 0.24(0.95)
2
(0.07143)(6,000 + 2,400 + 350)
= 8,047 + 29 + 71
= $8,147/year
In Step 3, we know that the set of best mi’s is m1 = m2 = 1 and m3 = 5 (from Step 1). Using
Equation 10.10, we have
TRC(best T and mi′s) = 8,470 +

2(2.10)0.24(8,750)
= 8,470 + 94
= $8,564/year > $8,147/year
Therefore, we should use the solution of Step 2—which assures that the smallest replenishment
quantity is at the breakpoint. This is achieved by using*
* The T and Q values have been adjusted slightly upward to ensure that Q1vO1 + Q2vO2 is at least as large as the
breakpoint value of $600.

We can see that a sizable saving of (8,564–8,147) or $417/year (around 4.9%) is achieved by
taking the discount.
10.4 Case of Probabilistic Demand and No Quantity Discounts
Probabilistic demand greatly complicates the decision problem in a coordinated control context.
Several questions must be answered:
1. How often do we review the status of items? (That is, the choice of the review interval, R.)
2. When do we reorder the group?
3. How much do we order? (In particular, whether or not to achieve a discount quantity on a
particular order.)
4. How do we allocate the total order among the individual items?

448
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
Because of the coordination, it no longer follows that an item will always be at its reorder point
when it is included in a replenishment. Usually, it will be above in that some other item in the
family will have triggered the order. This complicates matters in two ways. First, it is now more
diﬃcult to ascertain the average inventory level of an item. Second, and more serious, the service
implications of any particular reorder point are much more diﬃcult to evaluate than in the case of
individual-item control.
In the next two sections, we present an overview of two important types of coordinated control
systems under probabilistic demand, particularly emphasizing the second approach.
10.4.1 (S, c, s), or Can-Order, Systems
Can-order systems are speciﬁcally geared to the situation where savings in setup costs are of primary
concern (e.g., where several products are run on the same piece of equipment) as opposed to
achieving a speciﬁed total replenishment size (for quantity discount purposes). Balintfy (1964) was
the ﬁrst to propose the use of an (S, c, s) system, a special type of continuous review system for
controlling coordinated items. In such a system, whenever item i’s inventory position drops to or
below si (called its must-order point), it triggers a replenishment action that raises item i’s level
to its order-up-to-level Si. At the same time, any other item j (within the associated family) with
its inventory position at or below its can-order point cj is included in the replenishment. If item j
is included, a quantity is ordered suﬃcient to raise its level to Sj. The idea of having a can-order
point is to allow an item j, whose inventory position is low enough (at cj or lower), to be included
in the order triggered by item i, thus eliminating an extra major setup cost that would likely occur
in the near future when item j reaches its must-order point. On the other hand, inclusion of item
j in the order is not worthwhile if its inventory position is high enough—above its can-order
point (i.e., above cj). The behavior of a typical item under such a system of control is shown in
Figure 10.2.
For additional information on can-order systems, including how to establish appropriate values
of the s, c, and S, see Ignall (1969); Silver (1974); Thompstone and Silver (1975); Silver (1981);
Federgruen et al. (1984); Goyal and Satir (1989); Zheng (1994); Schultz and Johansen (1999);
and Nielsen and Larsen (2005). Related work includes Gross et al. (1972).
10.4.2 Periodic Review System
Atkins and Iyogun (1988) suggest a procedure for this problem that outperforms can-order policies,
and is easier to compute. McGee and Pyke (1996) apply this procedure at a fastener manufacturer
using a spreadsheet to ﬁnd the production quantities and safety stock. They modiﬁed the procedure
to account for sequence-dependent setup times and a production capacity constraint. The Atkins
and Iyogun (1988) procedure essentially allocates the major replenishment cost in small amounts
to the products that are produced or bought most frequently, keeping the expected time to the next
replenishment for these products in balance.
We now describe this procedure in some detail. First compute the EOQ and equivalent time
supply for each product i using only the minor setup cost ai:
EOQi =

2aiDi

Figure 10.2
Behavior of an item under (S, c, s) control.
So the time supply, or expected runout time, in weeks is EOQi(50)/Di, for product i assuming a
50-week year.* The result is a set of time supplies for each product in the family. Then choose the
product with the smallest time supply, and denote it product 1 for now. A small portion, α1, of
the major setup cost is allocated to this ﬁrst product. The idea is to eventually allocate the entire
major setup cost to several products in the family. If all the costs were allocated to one product,
its EOQ would increase signiﬁcantly, thereby increasing its time supply. It would then be likely
that this product would be purchased or produced less frequently than every cycle, and the setup
cost would be incorrect. Hence, the algorithm calls for allocating only a small portion of the major
setup cost to the most frequently purchased product.
Allocating more and more α1 to the ﬁrst product increases its time supply, eventually to the
point that it matches the time supply of the second most frequently purchased product (based
only on its ai), denoted product 2 for now. Now allocate more of the major setup cost to the ﬁrst
product, and some to product 2, keeping the time supplies in balance. When these two equal time
supplies increase to the time supply of the third most frequently purchased product, begin allocat-
ing α3 to this third product. This process continues until the entire major setup is allocated—that
is, 
i αi = 1. Therefore, each time a family is ordered, the entire setup cost is accounted for.
* This is essentially the same as Step 1 in Section 10.2.2.

450
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
If we express the total setup cost for an item as (αiA + ai), it is easy to solve for αi for a given
time supply:
αi = T 2
i riviDi
2A
−ai
A
(10.11)
where Ti is the time supply, EOQi/Di. This expression can be calculated in a spreadsheet to quickly
ﬁnd all values of αi such that the sum is 1 and the Ti values are equal for all products that have
αi > 0. The time supply of the set of products for which αi > 0 is called the base period, or base
cycle.
Atkins and Iyogun (1988) advocate rounding all products that are not purchased every cycle
to a multiple of the base period. McGee and Pyke (1996) use powers-of-two multiples of the base
period, so that each product’s cycle is either the base period or 21, 22, 23, etc. times the base period.
Powers-of-two multiples create a greater sense of order, allowing regular preventive maintenance,
communication with customers about production schedules, and easier scheduling of operators.
See also the references in footnote(*).
Finally, safety stock is determined by using the periodic review (R, S) policies of Chapter 6,
using the cycle time for each product as the R value.
10.4.2.1 Numerical Illustration
Four products are ordered by a distributor from a single vendor. The product data are given below,
and the following information has been gathered. The ﬁxed cost to place an order is $23, but once
an order is placed, an item can be added to the order for $3. Thus, we set A = $20, and a = $3.
The carrying charge is 24% and the delivery lead time is 1 week. Assume a 50-week year.

The ﬁrst step is to compute the EOQ and time supply based on the $3 minor ordering cost
only. This calculation is shown in the table, where, for example, the EOQ for product 1 is

* What we are assuming here is that if a discount is to be achieved, it must be achieved by every replenishment; that
is, we are ignoring the more complex possibility of achieving a discount on only some of the replenishments. The
smallest replenishments are those where only the items with mi = 1 are included. Lu (1995) develops a heuristic
method for ﬁnding the order quantities when it is possible to take the discount on some replenishments and not
on others. They ﬁnd that this additional ﬂexibility can yield signiﬁcant savings. See also Russell and Krajewski
(1992); Sadrian and Yoon (1992, 1994); Katz et al. (1994); and Xu et al. (2000).

and the time supply is 37.5/450 = 0.0833 years, or 4.17 weeks.
At this point, the major ordering cost has not been counted. So, we assign a small portion of the
$20 cost to product 4, which has the smallest time supply. For example, if α4 = 0.1, the total setup
cost is $20(0.1) + 3 = $5, and the new EOQ is 61, implying a time supply of 1.02 weeks. The
time supply is longer, as we would expect, but it is still less than that of product 2. As we gradually
increase α4 the time supply of product 4 increases until it reaches 1.58, the time supply of product
2. This occurs at α4 = 0.45, which can be found from Equation 10.11, using 1.58 for T.
Now, increase α4 slightly while increasing α2 as well, keeping the time supplies of the two in
balance. For example, if α4 = 0.70, and α2 = 0.063, the time supplies of each become 1.88 weeks.
If the time supplies were to increase to 4.17, the time supply of product 1, we would increase α1
also. This process would continue until 
i αi = 1. In this example, however, the sum of the α
values reaches 1.0 before their time supplies increase to 4.17. The values are α4 = 0.8898, and
α2 = 0.1102, which total to 1.0, and the time supplies of products 2 and 4 become 2.08 weeks.
Now, we have time supplies given in column 3 of Table 10.3.
The next step is to round the base period, 2.08, to an integer, or 2.0, and then round all other
time supplies to powers-of-two multiples of the base period. Thus, 4.17 is rounded to 2 × 21 = 4,
and 9.42 is rounded to 2 × 22 = 8.
Therefore, products 2 and 4 will be ordered every 2 weeks, while product 1 will be ordered
every 4 weeks, or on every other replenishment cycle. Product 3 will be ordered every fourth cycle.
On average, the amount ordered will be as given in column 5 of Table 10.3.
The ﬁnal step is to use methods of Chapter 6 to ﬁnd order-up-to-levels for each product, using
R as given in column 4 and L = 1 week. This entire procedure can be built on a spreadsheet and
searching for the α values. See Problem 10.9.
Tests of this procedure against the can-order policy as well as a number of other policies show
that it performs very well in terms of total cost. If the major setup cost is close to zero, can-
order policies perform better. However, ﬁnding optimal values of s, c, and S is not easy. See Iyogun
(1991); Golany and Lev-er (1992), and Pantumsinchai (1992). For other research on this problem,
see Sivazlian and Wei (1990); and Eynan and Kropp (1998). See also Song (1998) for ﬁnding the
ﬁll rate for a multi-item order.
10.5 Probabilistic Demand and Quantity Discounts
In contrast with the situation in the previous section, now it is attractive to achieve a speciﬁed
group order size. One obvious example is where a discount is oﬀered if the group order size exceeds

some level. Another is where several products are shipped on a periodic basis in a single truck, rail
car, or boat. In either case, it is important to answer the four questions posed near the start of
Section 10.4.
We ﬁrst provide an overview of a system developed by Miltenburg (1982) that is adapted for
use on a computer. Figure 10.3 should be helpful in understanding the following discussion of
Miltenburg’s system.
Block 1 in Figure 10.3 indicates that either continuous or periodic review can be used. In a coor-
dinated situation (particularly the transportation setting described earlier), a convenient periodic
review interval such as a day or a week would typically be used.
As indicated in Block 2, a reorder point system is used. At a review instant, if the inventory
position of any item in the family is at or below its reorder point, then a group replenishment is
triggered. The setting of the reorder points will be discussed later.
The choice of an appropriate group replenishment (Block 5), of course, depends on the cur-
rent inventory status of each item (Block 3) and what quantity discounts are currently available

Coordinated Replenishments at a Single Stocking Point

453
(Block 4). In this decision, the methodology of Section 10.2 could be used; however, it is based on
a steady-state model and does not take into account the current inventory situation. Thus, instead,
the more appropriate decision logic of the “special opportunity to buy” situation (Section 4.9.5 of
Chapter 4) is used to evaluate the various possible group replenishment sizes. We comment below
on a case in which a full truckload deﬁnes the group replenishment size.
Once an overall replenishment size is selected, it must be allocated (Block 6) among the indi-
vidual items. This is done to maximize the time until the next replenishment. After any given
allocation, the individual stock levels are depleted by demands. The ﬁrst to hit its reorder point
triggers a new group order at the next review instant. Because of the probabilistic nature of the
demand, the time until the next reorder is a random variable. Miltenburg models the demands for
separate items as independent, diﬀusion processes (a diﬀusion process, besides being mathemati-
cally convenient, has the attractive property of implying that the total demand over any particular
interval of time has a normal distribution).
Just as in Section 10.4.1, often an item will be reordered when it is above its reorder point.
This is because some other item in the family will trigger the replenishment. The excess stock
above the reorder point is known as residual stock. Account must be taken of this residual stock
because it provides safety stock above and beyond the usual safety stock built into the reorder
point. Unfortunately, the probability distribution of the residual stock of an item depends on the
inventory positions of all of the items after the allocation is made. Thus, after every allocation,
these distributions must be evaluated and used to establish the reorder points (Block 8) in order to
provide a desired service level (Block 7).
For the case of periodic review, Miltenburg has found that a normal distribution provides a
reasonable ﬁt to the distribution of residual stock. In contrast, for the case of continuous review, a
more appropriate ﬁt is achieved by a spike at 0 and a truncated normal distribution above it (see
Problem 10.8).
For other research in this area, see Low and Waddington (1967); Johnston (1980); Agnihothri
et al. (1982); Miltenburg and Silver (1984a,b,c, 1988); Miltenburg (1985, 1987); Ernst and Pyke
(1992); Van der Duyn Schouten et al. (1994); and Ettl et al. (2000).
10.5.1 A Full Truckload Application
In this section, we present an example of the Miltenburg system. One distributor of laminated
wood products ordered extremely long beams from its Oregon supplier. The supplier required that
the beams be shipped in full-truckload quantities because of the high ﬁxed cost of sending a truck.
This cost was due in part to police escorts that were required in many of the small towns the trucks
had to travel through. How should the distributor determine when to order the next truckload,
and how many of each beam should be ordered?
To solve this problem, we could apply the can-order system described in Section 10.4.1, but
there is no guarantee that the order quantities will generate a full truckload. The periodic system
of Atkins and Iyogun illustrated in Section 10.4.2 is another possibility, but again, we are faced
with the problem of ﬁlling the truck exactly. The solution we describe is an application of the
Miltenburg approach and is discussed by Carlson and Miltenburg (1988). It is called the service
point method, and it has been used successfully in an industrial application. We shall assume that
a periodic review system is employed (Block 1 of Figure 10.3). The steps are as follows:
1. Compute the acceptable shortages per replenishment cycle (ASPRC). This is a management
decision, and can be computed as follows: ASPRC = n
i=1 Yi(1 −P2), where Yi is the

454
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
expected usage of item i in the current replenishment cycle. (Yi is simply the expected order
size, Qi, because Qi is the average number of units used in each cycle), P2 is the ﬁll rate
discussed in Chapter 6, and n is the number of items in the family. (This is Block 7.)
2. At every review instant, compute the expected shortages per replenishment cycle (ESPRC) if
an order is not placed. Recall that ESPRC was computed as σLGu(k) in Chapter 6. In this
case, however, k is diﬀerent: k = (IP −ˆxR+L)/σR+L, where IP is the inventory position at
the time of the review. (Now we are not concerned with s, but with the inventory position
at the time of the review.) Also, because the next order, if we do not order now, will arrive
R + L periods later (R until the next review time, and L for delivery), we use R + L. (This is
an application of Block 3.)
3. If ESPRC > ASPRC, place an order. If not, wait until the next review period, and check
again. (This is a variation on Block 2.)
4. If the decision is to order, allocate the truck capacity to all products so as to maximize the time
to the next replenishment. This last step is a bit more complicated, but can be approximated
by assigning the truck capacity in proportion to the average demand of each product, adjusted
for the current inventory positions, IPi. That is, allocate (or order) an amount, Qi, of product
i, so to equate (IPi + Qi)/Di for all i, such that  Qi = TC, where TC is the truck capacity.*
(The truck capacity is the group replenishment size, or Block 5, and the allocation is Block 6.)
10.5.2 Numerical Illustration
As an illustration, assume that the distributor of laminated beams stocks just three products that
are supplied by the Oregon manufacturer. The data for each product are given below. In addition,
we shall simplify the problem slightly by assuming that the truck holds 850 beams of any size. In
reality, we would need to insure that the truck capacity is scaled by beam sizes. Management has
set a 98% ﬁll rate target for each product.

We can see that, on average, a truckload composed of 100, 250, and 500 beams of products
1, 2, and 3, respectively, is ordered each month. Of course, any particular order will likely be
composed of diﬀerent amounts than these.
At a given review instant, assume that the inventory positions of the three products are 15, 45,
and 125, respectively. We must decide whether to place an order. The ASPRC is calculated based

ASPRC =

i=1
Yi(1 −P2) = (100 + 250 + 500)(1 −0.98) = 17
So the k value for product 1 is computed as follows:
k1 = (IP1 −ˆxL+R)/σL+R = (15 −20)/5 = −1
where the subscript denotes the product number. Gu(k) is therefore 1.0833 (Table II.1 of
Appendix II, or a spreadsheet as described in Appendix III), and
ESPRC = σL+RGu(k) = 5(1.0322) = 5.42

The total ESPRC is 20.71, which is higher than the acceptable number of 17. Therefore, an order

As mentioned above, the allocation of truck capacity to the three products is somewhat compli-
cated. For this example, we illustrate a simple approach that provides a reasonable approximation.
In reality, one might want to consult the research papers mentioned above and apply an approach
that could provide lower-cost solutions. For our illustration, we begin the allocation by ordering
enough of each product to raise its inventory position to 80% of Yi. (The 80% value was cho-
sen based on work by Miltenburg (1985).) Because the inventory position of product 1 is 15,
100(0.80) −15 = 65 beams are initially allocated to this product. Likewise, products 2 and 3 are
allocated 250(0.80) −45 = 155 and 500(0.80) −125 = 275 beams, respectively. This totals 495
beams, leaving 750 −495 = 355 beams to allocate. If we allocate based on average demand rates,
product 1 should receive 1,200/(10,200) = 0.118 of the total. This translates to 0.118 (355) = 42
beams. Results for all products are shown below. The truck is ﬁlled by 107 beams of product 1,259
beams of product 2, and 484 beams of product 3. Notice that (IPi + Qi)/Di is the same (1.22) for
each product.

In other research, Pantumsinchai (1992) tests a rule similar to the service point method against

and periodic methods are quite good. For other research on the problem of ﬁnding order quanti-

Throughout this chapter, we have noted that these coordination issues also apply in the production
setting, where major and minor setups are determined by the time and cost of changing over
production equipment among families and within families. Unfortunately, unless the factory is not
capacity-constrained, the methods developed above cannot be applied unless adjustments are made.
In this section, we discuss several dimensions of the coordination problem in a production setting.
The methods we describe apply most commonly in the lower right corner of the product process
matrix introduced in Chapter 2. In other words, they are applied in continuous ﬂow processes,
although they may also be applicable to batch ﬂow processes.
10.6.1 Case of Constant Demand and Capacity: Economic Lot
Scheduling Problem
A pharmaceutical manufacturer with which one of the authors consulted was faced with a bottle-
neck in the packaging lines. Changeover from one product to another entailed a major cleaning that
could take up to 8 hours, while changes of label took only 1/2 hour. How should this ﬁrm sched-
ule production at the packaging lines to replenish ﬁnished goods inventory in time to meet their
service goals? One possibility is a can-order system. However, any system that reacts to demand
occurrences is in danger of creating an idle facility for some time, followed by an overload due to
multiple families reaching their reorder points at the same time. The factory simply may not have
enough capacity to meet the demand. A better choice is to be proactive by creating a sequence of
production that will be followed periodically, similar to the procedure described in Section 10.4.2.
The solution to the economic lot scheduling problem (ELSP) is designed to do precisely that.

In the discussion that follows, we shall assume that if setup times are dependent on the sequence
of production, a particular sequence of products can be developed and will be followed.* Thus, we
will know the correct setup cost and time to use for each family and each item within the family.
Membership in a family is deﬁned by relatively low setup time or cost between members. Also,
in this section we shall assume that demand is constant over time. In other words, we assume
that the pharmaceutical manufacturer faces very little demand ﬂuctuation and that there is no
seasonality or trend in the demand over time. (In Sections 10.6.2 and 10.6.3, we will relax this
restrictive assumption.) This constant demand case is essentially the same as the economic order
quantity context discussed in Section 4.1 of Chapter 4, except there are several items with diﬀering
demand rates and ﬁnite production rates, and there is, of course, a production capacity restriction.
A simple selection of independent ﬁnite-rate economic run quantities of the separate items (see
Equation 4.19 of Chapter 4) can easily lead to an infeasible solution because two or more items are
likely to require production at the same time.
The ELSP is to ﬁnd a cycle length, a production sequence, production times, and idle times,
so that the production sequence can be completed in the chosen cycle, the cycle can be repeated
over time, demand can be fully met, and annual inventory and setup costs can be minimized. As
it happens, this problem is notoriously diﬃcult to solve.† Two factors contribute to this diﬃculty:
the need to satisfy a production capacity constraint, and the need to have only one product in
production at a time (a so-called “synchronization” constraint). A multitude of papers have been
written on the ELSP. Here we provide a procedure for a simple case, and then brieﬂy review some
of the literature that extends the research into more complex situations.
Let us begin by introducing several terms used frequently in the literature. A cyclic schedule
is one in which the entire system is periodic, which means that, regardless of the sequence of
production, the schedule repeats itself over time. One variant of a cyclic schedule is to choose a base
period and to restrict the order interval of each item to be an integer multiple of that base period.
This variant includes the powers-of-two multiples mentioned above.‡ Whatever the multiple, the
batch sizes of a given item will be the same over time.§ A special case of the base period approach
is a pure rotation schedule, in which each product is produced once in each cycle.¶ In other words,
each product shares a common order interval, T. Of course, there is no guarantee that this schedule
will be optimal. Therefore, when we restrict the choice of schedules to this type, we are resorting to
the use of a heuristic. A second variant of a cyclic schedule is to allow items to be produced more
than once in the overall period of the system, and to allow the batch sizes for each item to diﬀer
over that period.∗∗We will focus here on pure rotation schedules.
* An example of sequence-dependent setups is a fastener manufacturer that has long setup times between fastener
sizes, but short setup times within size. (Products that share the same size may diﬀer in the cut of the thread,
the ﬁnish, or other factors.) Another is beer production that sequences products from high quality to low quality.
Within a family (or a given quality level), there are diﬀerent container sizes. See Dobson (1992) and McGee and
Pyke (1996).
† See, for example, Hsu (1983) and Gallego and Shaw (1997).
‡ See Maxwell and Singh (1983); Jackson et al. (1985); and Roundy (1985, 1989) who have suggested the use
of powers-of-two multiples of the base period for all products in the family. They show that the cost of this
restriction is very low—within 6% of the optimal if a ﬁxed base cycle is used, and within 2% if the base cycle is
a variable.

Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
In a pure rotation schedule, there is no chance of two products requiring production equipment
at the same time because each product is scheduled only once during each cycle. Therefore, if a cycle
length can be found that satisﬁes the capacity constraint, we will have a feasible solution to the pure
rotation heuristic. In developing a pure rotation schedule, we shall focus the discussion on ﬁnding
the reorder interval, rather than the batch size, partly because it is often easier to think in terms of
frequency of production than in terms of number of units. The mathematical representation of the
problem also becomes easier. Implementation is much easier as well because the planner can adjust
batch sizes a little if demand varies, while keeping to the same reorder interval. This regularity
facilitates preventive maintenance, operator scheduling, and coordination with other machines.
(See Muckstadt and Roundy 1993.)
Some notation is required:
T = the common order interval, or time supply, for each product, in units of time
pi = the production rate for product i, in units per unit time
Ai = setup cost for item i, in dollars
Ki = setup time for item i, in units of time
Di = demand rate of item i, in units/unit time
vi = unit variable cost of item i, in $/unit
n = number of items in the family (the items are numbered 1, 2, 3, . . . , n −1, n)
The total relevant costs for item i are (following the ﬁnite production rate treatment in
Section 4.8)
TRCi(T) = Ai
T + rviDi(pi −Di)T
2pi
Notice that DiT = the batch size for item i. Now let Hi = (rviDi(pi −Di))/2pi to simplify
the notation. The total amount of time to produce a batch of product i is Ki + (DiT/pi), or the
setup plus processing times. Therefore, we need a constraint on the total time in a cycle:

Taking the derivative of Equation 10.13 with respect to T and setting it equal to zero gives

(10.16)
If the capacity constraint Equation 10.12 is satisﬁed, the optimal T value is given by T ′.
Otherwise, T needs to be increased to insure that there is enough capacity. Then the optimal value
is exactly the constraint (because n
i=1 TRCi(T) is a convex function of T):
T ′′ =

Therefore, the optimal order interval is max(T ′, T ′′).
10.6.1.1 Numerical Illustration
A pharmaceutical manufacturer produces three bottle sizes of one product on one packaging
machine. No other products are assigned to this equipment, and although other equipment is
used for this product, this machine is the clear bottleneck. The data for the item are given in the
following table:
Item

The carrying charge, r, is 25%. The setup times for the three items are 6, 15, and 8 hours,
respectively. So, 0.00068 = 6/[(365 days)(24 hours per day)], because the equipment is run 24
hours per day. Using Equation 10.16, we ﬁnd
T ′ =

125 + 100 + 110
7,284 + 33,781 + 6,233 = 0.0842
From Equation 10.15, we ﬁnd that
0.00068 + 0.00171 + 0.00091
1 −(1,850/5,000 + 1,150/3,500 + 800/3,000) = 0.0952 > 0.0842
Therefore, the order interval is too low and the capacity constraint is violated. So we set
T ′′ = 0.0952 using Equation 10.17. Converting this value to weeks yields a production cycle

of 0.0952(52) = 4.95, or 5 weeks. Every 5 weeks, set up and produce (5/52)(1,850) = 178 units
of product 1, followed by 111 units of product 2 and 77 units of product 3. (How much time is
spent for each batch?)
Gallego and Queyranne (1995) show that there is an easy way to determine how close the
pure rotation schedule may be to the optimal. First compute the optimal time supply for each
item taken independently using Equation 4.7 of Chapter 4 or T ∗
i = √Ai/Hi. In our illustration,
these values are 0.1310, 0.0544, and 0.1328, respectively. Then take the ratio of the largest to the
smallest of these values, and call it R. So R = 0.1328/0.0544 = 2.44. The ratio of the cost of the
pure rotation schedule (TRCPRS) to the optimal (TRCOPT) is then
TRCPRS
TRCOPT
≤1
2
	√
R + 1/
√
R

In our illustration, this bound is 1.10. Thus, the cost of the pure rotation schedule is no more
than 10% more than the cost of the unknown optimal solution.
We now mention a small portion of the literature on the ELSP. The earliest work in this ﬁeld
has been reviewed by Elmaghraby (1978). More recently, Dobson (1987) developed a formulation
of the problem that allows lot sizes and therefore cycle times to vary over time. (This is the second
variant of cyclic schedules mentioned above.) He was also one of the ﬁrst to explicitly consider
setup time, rather than using setup cost as a surrogate of setup time. See also Maxwell (1964) and
Delporte and Thomas (1977). Zipkin (1991a) built on Dobson’s work by taking the sequences
from Dobson as givens, and then using a heuristic to ﬁnd the production run times and machine
idle times for each product. Taken together, Zipkin and Dobson provided a heuristic that computes
feasible schedules with reasonable eﬀort. Bourland and Yano (1997) test several heuristics and show
their performance.
Additional research has addressed the ELSP with the added complication of delivery schedules
when a supplier would rather run larger lot sizes than the customer desires. See Hahm and Yano
(1992, 1995a,b). Silver (1995) and Viswanathan and Goyal (1997) consider the situation in which
a family of items follows a cyclic schedule, but there is a limit on shelf life. The cycle length and
production rate are adjusted to insure a feasible schedule. Taylor and Bolander (1996) ask a series of
questions designed to help the reader understand whether MRP (Chapter 15) is the correct tool for
scheduling the factory. The focus of the article is to determine whether process ﬂow scheduling,
like ELSP, is appropriate. See also Taylor and Bolander (1990, 1991, 1994) and Bolander and
Taylor (1990).
In the realm of changing the givens, Gallego and Moon (1992) examine a multiple product
factory that employs a cyclic schedule to minimize holding and setup costs. When setup times
can be reduced, at the expense of setup costs, by externalizing setup operations, they show that
dramatic savings are possible for highly utilized facilities. Allen (1990) modiﬁes the ELSP to allow
production rates to be decision variables. He then develops a graphical method for ﬁnding the
production rates and cycle times for a two-product problem. The results were successfully applied
in a chemical ﬁrm. See also Moon et al. (1991); Hwang et al. (1993); Gallego (1993); Gallego and
Moon (1995); and Moon (1994).

10.6.2 Case of Time-Varying Demand and Capacity:
Capacitated Lot Sizing
The methods of Chapter 5 apply to the case of time-varying deterministic demand when there
is no capacity constraint. A more diﬃcult problem arises if it may not be possible to produce or
purchase all of the desired parts in a given period. In addition, we allow production capacities to
vary with time (but they are still assumed to be known with certainty). Under such circumstances,
as in Chapter 5, it is most common to consider discrete time intervals such as days or weeks, each
with a known capacity and known individual-item demand rates. The objective is to keep the total
(across all items and all periods out to some horizon) of setup and carrying costs as low as possible,
subject to (1) no backlogging of demand or loss of sales, and (2) no violations of production
capacity constraints.
In Chapter 5, for the single-item, uncapacitated situation, we were able to argue that a replen-
ishment quantity need only be placed when the inventory level is zero,* and also that we can
restrict our attention to replenishment quantities that would cover exactly an integer number of
periods of requirements. This is certainly not the case with capacitated production as evidenced
by the simple, single-item example shown in Table 10.4. The only feasible schedule is to produce
at capacity (i.e., 10 units) each period. Clearly, the quantity produced in period 1 lasts for 1.3
periods and, moreover, production must take place in period 2 even though the starting inventory
in that period is nonzero (3 units). Thus, the nature of the solution, even for a single-item prob-
lem, is considerably more complicated when production capacities are taken into account. Not
surprisingly, a mathematically optimal solution is out of the question when we are dealing with the
multi-item, time-varying, capacitated case. We must again turn to the use of a heuristic solution
procedure.
We outline the nature of a heuristic procedure ﬁrst developed by Dixon (1979), and also
presented in Dixon and Silver (1981). Subsequent industrial applications are described by Van
Wassenhove and De Bodt (1983) and Van Wassenhove and Vanderhenst (1983). The latter, in
particular, use the heuristic as part of an hierarchical planning framework. The procedure is
forward-looking in nature; as with the basic Silver–Meal heuristic of Chapter 5, it develops the
current period’s production quantities using demand information for as few periods into the future
as possible (a desirable characteristic when we recognize the increasing uncertainty in forecasts as
we project further into the future). The heuristic makes use of the Silver–Meal heuristic’s basic
criterion—namely, that, if item 1 is to be produced in period 1, then we wish to select the produc-
tion time supply (Ti) as the integer number of periods that produces the (ﬁrst local) minimum of

the total relevant costs per unit time:
TRCUT(Ti) =
Ai + hi
Ti
j=1(j −1)Dij
Ti
where
Ai = setup cost for item i, in $
hi (or vir) = holding cost for item i, in $/unit/period
Dij = demand for item i in period j, in units
However, where capacity is limited, there is competition for a scarce resource and it is quite likely
that not all lot sizes to be produced in a particular period can be such that the associated TRCUT
is minimized. In order to describe how the heuristic deals with this diﬃculty, we need to introduce
a new variable Ui, deﬁned as follows:
Ui = TRCUT(Ti) −TRCUT(Ti + 1)
kiDi,Ti+1
where ki is the amount of production resource required per unit produced of item i.
We can see that Ui represents the marginal decrease in costs per unit time of item i per unit of
capacity absorbed if the time supply produced of item i is increased from Ti to Ti + 1. Each item
requiring production in the period under consideration has its Ti ﬁrst set to unity (the minimum
feasible amount that must be produced). Then, the item with the largest positive Ui has its Ti
increased to Ti + 1. This is continued until there is insuﬃcient capacity to increase any of the Ti’s
by unity or until all Ui’s are negative (the latter situation would give the unconstrained Silver–Meal
lot sizes for each of the items).
The above procedure clearly does not violate the capacity restriction in the particular period
being scheduled. However, it does not guard against another type of infeasibility. Consider the
situation where in some future period the total demand exceeds the production capacity of that
period. Then, some of the requirements of that period must be satisﬁed by production in preceding
periods. This is illustrated by our example of Table 10.4 where four of the units required in period
4 must be produced prior to that period. Thus, the heuristic also has a look-ahead feature built
into it to ensure that, as the Ti’s are increased (as described in the previous paragraph), enough
total production is accomplished to prevent future infeasibilities.
If the heuristic is applied to a problem having a horizon with well-deﬁned ending conditions,
then the above procedure is used to establish an initial solution of all production lots out to the
horizon. In such a case, the authors discuss several possible adjustments for improving on the
initial solution. However, extensive testing has revealed that only one of these types of adjustments
tends to be attractive in terms of potential savings without too much extra computational eﬀort.
Speciﬁcally, an attempt should be made to eliminate each scheduled lot by, if possible, allocating
the production to periods where there is capacity available and the item under consideration is
already being produced. The lot should be eliminated only if the increased carrying costs do not
exceed the setup cost saved. In the more common case of a rolling-horizon implementation with
an indeﬁnite ending point, we do not recommend any such adjustment procedure.
There have been a number of other heuristic procedures developed for solving the capaci-
tated, multi-item, time-varying demand problem. See reviews by De Bodt et al. (1984); Thizy
and Van Wassenhove (1985); Bitran and Matsuo (1986); Bahl and Zionts (1987); and Maes and

(1995); DeMatta and Guignard (1995); Potamianos et al. (1996); and Tempelmeier and Derstroﬀ
(1996). We make special mention of a procedure presented by Van Nunen and Wessels (1978)
because it involves a conceptual approach very diﬀerent from that of the Dixon and Silver heuristic.
The latter builds up an initial feasible schedule with possible subsequent attempts at improve-
ment. The van Nunen and Wessels approach is to ﬁrst ignore the capacity restrictions and solve
each individual item problem independently. The resulting overall solution is usually infeasi-
ble, violating one or more of the production capacities. The next step is to adjust the solution
until it is feasible with as small as possible an increase in the costs. (See also Karni and Roll
1982.)
Variations on this problem are many. Eppen and Martin (1987); Pochet and Wolsey (1991);
and Millar and Yang (1994) consider a related problem, but add the possibility of backordering.
A number of authors have examined the case in which there is a cost to start up a facility for
production, and a reservation cost that represents the cost of having the facility available regardless
of whether it is producing or not. This reservation cost may represent the opportunity cost of tying
up the facility or machine for the given product, and thus making it unavailable for other products.
Therefore, a single item problem can be viewed as a subproblem of the more realistic multi-item
case. This research applies when the facility produces a relatively small number of products, and a
product may tie up the facility for more than one time period. See Karmarkar and Schrage (1985);
Karmarkar et al. (1987); Sandbothe (1991); Hindi (1995); and Coleman and McKnew (1995).
10.6.3 Probabilistic Demand: The Stochastic Economic
Lot Scheduling Problem
When demand, setup times or processing rates are not deterministic, production may not follow
the production plan developed by deterministic approaches considered in the ELSP described in
Section 10.6.1. If variability is high, there may be signiﬁcant disruptions from using the deter-
ministic solution in a probabilistic environment. Thus, adjustments must be made. The stochastic
economic lot scheduling problem (SELSP) exactly parallels the ELSP with the added complexity
of probabilistic (i.e., stochastic) demand, setup times, or processing rates.
There are two basic approaches to dealing with this problem. One is to develop a regular cyclic
schedule using a solution to the deterministic problem, and then to develop a control rule that
attempts to track or follow this schedule. The other is to develop a heuristic that directly decides
which product to produce next and its production quantity. Therefore, the production sequence
can vary over time.
Examples of the ﬁrst approach include Bourland and Yano (1994) who consider the use of safety
stock and idle time to account for random demand. They ﬁnd that except when setup costs are

464
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
very high, it is better to use safety stock rather than built-in idle time. See also Gallego (1990) who
develops a real-time scheduling tool in three steps. First, replace probabilistic demands by their
average values, and compute an optimal or near-optimal target cyclic schedule. Next, formulate
a control policy to recover the target cyclic schedule after a disruption perturbs the inventories.
Finally, ﬁnd safety stocks to minimize the long run average cost of following the target schedule
with the recovery policy. See also Loerch and Muckstadt (1994); Gallego (1994); and Gallego and
Moon (1996).
A particularly compelling solution is by Federgruen and Katalan (1996c) who propose a simple
strategy: when the facility is assigned to a given product, continue production until either a target
inventory level is reached or a speciﬁc production batch is completed. The diﬀerent products are
produced in a given sequence, possibly with idle times inserted between the completion of an
item’s production batch and the setup for the next item. Federgruen and Katalan (1996c) provide
a rather complex but very fast and accurate algorithm for computing the approximately optimal
policy. Markowitz et al. (2000) show that setup costs should not be used as a surrogate for setup
times, and that the policy of Federgruen and Katalan (1996c) should not be used when setup times
are negligible but setup costs are high. They allow for switching production from one product to
another based on the inventories of all products. Contrast this with the base stock policy, which
relies only on the status of the product currently being produced. See also Bowman and Muckstadt
(1993); Federgruen and Katalan (1994, 1996a,b, 1998); Anupindi and Tayur (1998); and Bowman
and Muckstadt (1995).
The second approach, which dynamically decides which product to produce next, will generally
have lower total costs, but may not be better in a real application because of disruptions to schedules
of other production stages. Leachman and Gascon (1988) develop a methodology based on target
cyclic schedules that are updated dynamically based on estimates of the time when inventories of
various products will run out. They assume periodic review and rely on the ELSP solution for
deterministic nonstationary demand to ﬁnd the next item to produce and the production quantity.
The schedule is modiﬁed if an item is backordered or close to a stockout. See also Leachman et al.
(1991); Wein (1992); Veatch and Wein (1996); Duenyas and Van Oyen (1995, 1996); Perez and
Zipkin (1997); Gascon et al. (1994); Goncalves et al. (1994); Duenyas and Van Oyen (1996); Qui
and Loulou (1995); Sox and Muckstadt (1995, 1996); and Shaoxiang and Lambrecht (1996). Carr
et al. (1993) consider a strategy that makes B and C items to order, while making A items to stock.
For the probabilistic time-varying demand case, see Karmarkar and Yoo (1994) and Winands
et al. (2011).
10.7 Shipping Consolidation
A problem related to the coordination of multiple items is that of shipment consolidation. When
a customer order arrives, the vendor must decide whether to ship the order immediately, or to wait
for more orders to arrive so that the truck will be more fully loaded. Clearly, the truck entails a ﬁxed
cost regardless of the number of units shipped. In addition, costs may increase for each additional
unit included. The focus here is on unit weight or volume, rather than on line items in a cus-
tomer order, as above. Higginson and Bookbinder (1994) pointed out that shipment consolidation
decisions include:
■Which orders will be consolidated and which will be shipped individually?

Coordinated Replenishments at a Single Stocking Point
■
465
■When will orders be released for possible shipping? Immediately, or after some time trigger
or quantity trigger?
■Where will the consolidation take place? At the factory or at an oﬀ-site warehouse or
terminal?
■Who will consolidate? The manufacturer, customer, or a third party?
Higginson and Bookbinder (1994) also tested three policies: a time policy that ships at a prespec-
iﬁed time, a quantity policy that ships when a given quantity is achieved, and a time/quantity
policy that ships at the earliest of the time and quantity values. The shipper must trade oﬀcost per
unit with customer service in deciding on which policy to use. Some literature that may be helpful
includes Tyworth et al. (1991); Van Eijs (1994); Bausch et al. (1995); Higginson and Bookbinder
(1995); and Hall and Racer (1995).
10.8 Summary
In this chapter, we ﬁrst showed the details of coordinated control under deterministic demand,
both with and without quantity discounts. Then, we developed an appreciation of the complexity
of the probabilistic demand situation. For the latter, we illustrated a useful model for coordinated
control. We then extended the discussion to the production context and examined constant and
deterministic demand, time-varying deterministic demand, and probabilistic demand.
In the next chapter, we turn to another, probably more important, type of coordination. That
is, where the same item is stored at more than one location with stock ﬂowing from one location
to another.

The Ptomaine Tavern, a famous fast-lunch spot near an institute of higher learning, pro-
cures three basic cooking ingredients from the same supplier. H. Fishman, one of the
co-owners, estimates that the ﬁxed cost associated with placing an order is $10. In addi-
tion, there is a ﬁxed “aggravation” charge of $1 for each SKU included in the order. Usage
of each of the three ingredients is relatively stable with time. The usages and basic unit
values are as follows:

a. If a coordinated replenishment strategy is to be used, what should be the values of the
mi’s?
b. When pressed by a consulting analyst for a value of the carrying charge r (needed
to compute the family cycle time T), Fishman replies: “I don’t know from nothing
concerning a carrying charge! All I know is that I’m satisﬁed with placing an order
every 2 weeks.” How would you use this answer to impute an approximate value of r?
Discuss why it is likely to be only an approximation.
c. What quantities of the three items should the Ptomaine Tavern order?
d. Suppose that the supplier oﬀers Ptomaine a 3% discount on any order totaling at least
$1,350 in value (before the discount). Fishman’s partner, L. Talks, likes the idea of
saving on the purchase price. Fishman is not so sure about the advisability of tying
up so much money in inventory. Should Ptomaine take advantage of the quantity
discount oﬀer?
10.3
Suppose you wished to estimate the annual costs of treating the members of a family
independently in setting up run quantities. Under independent treatment, some major
setups would be avoided, simply by the chance happening of two items of the same family
being run one right after the other. How would you estimate the fraction of setups where
this would happen?

The initial setup cost for the family is $30. Management has agreed on an r value of 0.10

a. What are the preferred run quantities of the three items?
b. Raw material for product BB1 is acquired from a supplier distinct from that for the
other two products. Suppose that the BB1 supplier oﬀers an 8% discount on all units
if an order of 700 or more is placed. Should Steady–Milver take the discount oﬀer?

Brown (1967) has suggested a procedure for allocating a total order (of size W dollars)
among a group of n items (i = 1, 2, . . . , n). A particular time interval (perhaps until
the next order arrives) of duration T is considered. The allocation is made so that the
probability that item i runs out during T is proportional to the fraction of the group’s
sales that item i contributes. (Brown shows that this procedure, at least approximately,
minimizes the total stock remaining at the end of the interval.) Suppose that it is reasonable
to assume that demand in period T for item i is normally distributed with mean ˆxi and
standard deviation σTi.
a. Introducing whatever symbols are necessary, develop a routine for allocating the order
among the items according to the above criterion.

In Miltenburg’s coordinated control system, the residual stock of a particular item is
denoted by the symbol z, and in the case of periodic review, it turns out to be reason-
able to approximate its distribution by a normal distribution with mean μz and standard
deviation σz.
a. Why is there a spike at z = 0 in the continuous review case but not in the periodic
review case? Also, why can z be negative in the periodic review situation?

A drink bottler uses one bottling line to ﬁll three diﬀerent sized soft drink containers with
the same soft drink. Other drinks are bottled on the same line as well. We shall consider
only one product whose sizes are 10, 16, and 20 ounces, and whose demands are constant
enough to be safely considered deterministic. The major setup cost to convert to this type
of drink is estimated to be $65. It costs $22 to switch from one container size to another.
The demand rates for this family of items are shown below. The carrying charge has been
established as 0.24 $/$/year. Moreover, there is substantial excess capacity in the operation,
so it is reasonable to ignore capacity considerations.

National Electronics distributes a wide variety of electronic products. National has been
experiencing cash ﬂow problems; hence it is concerned about its investment in inventories.
A management consultant, Mr. P. C. Snow, has been hired to suggest ordering decision

rules. As a preliminary step, he selects for study an important group of 10 products all
bought from the same supplier, Harolds Corp. Based on an analysis of ordering costs, Mr.
Snow estimates that the replenishment cost, A, in dollars, is given by
A = 46 + 5.5(V −1,000)/1,000
(10.18)
where V is the total dollar value of the order and a minimum order size of $1,000 is
required by Harolds. The National Electronics Controller, Mr. P. J. Schmeidler, tells Snow
that the company uses an r value of 0.24 $/$/year. The sales forecast for each of the next 12
months, as well as the unit values, are shown in Exhibit 1. Snow ascertains that the require-
ments for any particular month must be on hand at the beginning of the month; hence
he can restrict his attention to replenishments covering an integer number of months. In
addition, at least initially, he decides to consider a deterministic version of the problem,
namely, where lead times are known and the forecasts represent actual demands. Snow
observes that because a marked seasonality exists, a simple EOQ strategy is inappropriate.
He considers two possible types of decision rules:

1. Order the same ﬁxed time supply (e.g., 2 months coverage) of all items.
2. Use a modiﬁed version of the Silver–Meal heuristic (Section 5.6 of Chapter 5), a mod-
iﬁcation is necessary because of the nature of the setup cost A which can be shared
among two or more items involved in the same order.
Snow argues that any reasonable decision rule would require a group replenishment
to arrive at the beginning of September, the start of the peak demand period. Hence, he
assumes 0 inventories of all the items just prior to the beginning of September 2016.
a. For the ﬁxed time supply (T months) strategy, he evaluates the order quantities, replen-
ishment costs, and carrying costs for each of T = 1, 2, and 3 months. Develop these
quantities and select what appears to be the best T value.

474
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
b. In an eﬀort to appropriately modify the Silver–Meal heuristic, Snow reasons as follows.
Suppose that a particular order involves n items and has a total value of V . Then, the
setup cost A is given by Equation 10.18. Hence, an approximate apportioned cost for
each item involved in the order is
46 + 5.5(V −1,000)/1,000
n
The problem is that V depends on the order quantities, which, in turn, should depend
upon the setup cost. This suggests the use of an iterative procedure. Historically, the
average total value of an order involving n items has been approximately $600n. Thus
he starts with the Silver–Meal heuristic for each individual item using an A value of
A = 46 + 5.5(60V −1,000)/1,000
n
= 3.30 + 40.5/n
(10.19)
The actual total value of the resulting group replenishment is determined from the
individual order quantities. This implies a new value of A, the heuristic is reused, a
new V is obtained, etc. until convergence takes place. Illustrate in detail these compu-
tations for the ﬁrst replenishment (at the start of September), which must include all
10 items. Once a stable set of order quantities is established for a particular group
replenishment, Snow moves on to the next time where at least one item requires
another replenishment. The above iterative procedure involving A and V is used for
that group of items. Complete, in this fashion, the 12 months of the modiﬁed heuris-
tic computations. Determine the total replenishment and carrying costs and compare
with your answer in part a.
c. Rather than iterating as above, suppose instead that for each group replenishment the
individual item A was established according to Equation 10.19 and the Silver–Meal
results with this A value were used. Carry through the calculations on this basis and
evaluate the total replenishment and carrying costs.
d. Which approach do you think that Snow should recommend?
Appendix 10A: Derivation of Results in Section 10.2
If a time interval T between replenishments of the family and a set of mi’s are used, where mi, an
integer, is the number of T intervals that the replenishment quantity of item i will last, then this
replenishment quantity (Qi) is given by
Qi = DimiT
(10A.1)
The typical sawtooth diagram of inventory is applicable so that the average inventory of item
i(¯Ii) is
¯Ii = Qi

A group setup cost (A) is incurred every T units of time, whereas the cost ai is incurred only once
in every miT units of time. Therefore, the total relevant costs per unit time are given by

(Note that we do not include the purchase cost in the total relevant costs in this case. However, we
do need to include it when a quantity discount is available.)
Setting

Substitution of Equation 10A.3 back into Equation 10A.2 gives the best cost for a given set of

(10A.4)
(This equation was used to directly produce Equation 10.10.)
We wish to select the mi’s to minimize TRC*(mi’s). From an inspection of Equation 10A.4,
this is achieved by selecting the mi’s to minimize
F(mi′s) =
	
A +


 
miDivi
(10A.5)
The minimization of Equation 10A.5 is no simple matter because of two facts: (1) the mi’s interact
(i.e., the eﬀects of one mi value depend on the values of the other mi’s) and (2) the mi’s must be

We can see that if

then (the continuous solution) mj is less than (the continuous solution) mk. Therefore, the item i
having the smallest value of ai/Divi should have the lowest value of mi, namely, 1. It is reasonable
to assume that this will hold even when the mj’s are restricted to being integers; of course, in this
case, more than one item could have mj = 1.
If the items are numbered such that item 1 has the smallest value of ai/Divi, then
m1 = 1

mj =

to the result of Equation 10.5.

Chapter 11
Multiechelon Inventory
Management
In Chapters 4 through 9, we were primarily focused on single-item, single-location inventory sys-
tems. In Chapter 10, we extended the discussion to multiple items, and the issues associated with
coordinating their ordering or production. In this chapter, we extend our treatment to another level
of complexity—multiple locations. Speciﬁcally, we examine inventory control across the entire sup-
ply chain. As we will see, the solution approaches are somewhat more complex, but a student with
solid understanding of the single-location models treated elsewhere in the book should be well
prepared for this complexity. In this chapter, we focus on the multilocation setting where there is a
single decision maker controlling inventory. We further investigate the important situation where
decisions cross organizational boundaries in Chapter 12.
We begin in Section 11.1 by introducing supply chain management and the many issues
involved with managing a supply chain. Section 11.2 discusses broader strategic issues that
help to frame the discussion of the multiechelon models and insights we develop thereafter. In
Section 11.3, we deal with the conceptually easiest situation of deterministic demand. Neverthe-
less, particularly when the demand rate varies with time, exact analysis quickly becomes quite
complicated. Section 11.4 introduces the complexities of probabilistic demand in a multiechelon
framework. We describe what is known as a base stock control system, a serial system, two arbores-
cent (tree-structure) systems, and a “push” system. Next, in Section 11.5, for the ﬁrst time, we
deal with the so-called product recovery situation. Speciﬁcally, now, not all units demanded are con-
sumed, but rather some units are returned, perhaps in a damaged state. As a result, both repair
and purchase decisions must be made. Finally, we present additional insights in Section 11.6. As
we have done throughout this book, in this chapter, we refer, sometimes very brieﬂy, to research
papers that apply to the relevant topics. These are intended for further insight and research, and
can be safely ignored by many readers.
11.1 Multiechelon Inventory Management
Supply chain management (SCM) is the term used to describe the management of materials
and information across the entire supply chain, from suppliers to component producers to ﬁnal

assemblers to distribution (warehouses and retailers), and ultimately to the consumer. In fact, it
often includes after-sales service and returns or recycling. Figure 11.1 is a schematic of a supply
chain. Supply chain management has generated much interest in recent years because of the real-
ization that actions taken by one member of the chain can inﬂuence the performance of all others
in the chain. Firms are increasingly thinking in terms of competing as part of a supply chain against
other supply chains, rather than as a single ﬁrm against other individual ﬁrms. Also, as ﬁrms suc-
cessfully streamline their own operations, the next opportunity for improvement is through better
coordination with their suppliers and customers.
Before addressing opportunities for better coordination with suppliers and customers (in
Chapter 12), we focus in this chapter on how a ﬁrm can manage inventory across multiple loca-
tions under their control. As suggested by Figure 11.1, it is often the case that a single ﬁrm makes
inventory decisions at multiple locations such as their ﬁnal assembly locations, warehouses, and
retail outlets. Speciﬁcally, we will introduce models of multiechelon inventory systems that can be
used to optimize the deployment of inventory in a supply chain and to evaluate a change in the
supply chain “givens.” We will look at the case of an item being stocked at more than one location
with resupply being made between at least some of the locations. A three-echelon illustration is
shown in Figure 11.2. Retail outlets (the ﬁrst echelon) are replenished from branch warehouses
(the second echelon), which are supplied from a central warehouse (the third echelon). The lat-
ter, in turn, is replenished from outside sources. Inventory management in this system is complex
because demand at the central warehouse is dependent on the demand (and stocking decisions) at
the branches. And demand at the branches is dependent on the demand (and stocking decisions)
at the retail outlets. More generally, we refer to this as a dependent demand situation, in contrast
with earlier chapters of the book where demands for diﬀerent stock-keeping units were considered
to be independent.
Multistage manufacturing situations (raw materials, components, subassemblies, assemblies)
are conceptually very similar to multiechelon inventory systems. However, in this chapter, we

restrict our attention to pure inventory (distribution) situations, by ignoring any ﬁnite replenish-
ment capacities that are usually present in the production context. Nevertheless, some of the results
of this chapter can be applied, with due caution, within production environments and, in fact,
were developed with that type of application in mind. In addition, we will return in Chapter 15
to a detailed treatment of multistage manufacturing systems in which the concept of dependent
demand will play a crucial role.
It seems intuitive that using the multiechelon inventory techniques we describe below provides
signiﬁcant beneﬁt over using the methods of Chapters 6 and 7 in a multilevel setting. (See, e.g.,
Muckstadt and Thomas 1980.) Moreover, these multiechelon techniques have been successfully
implemented. See, for example, Cohen et al. (1990) who apply multiechelon methods in a low
demand, spare parts environment. Farasyn et al. (2011) describe the beneﬁts of using inventory
optimization tools, including multiechelon approaches at a large consumer goods ﬁrm. For very
slow-moving items, from a single-level perspective, each retailer might hold, say, one unit, and yet
sell one or fewer units per year. Because multiechelon models examine the entire system, they might
recommend holding just a few parts at the warehouse level, and none at the retailers. System-wide
savings can be enormous. With faster-moving parts, of course, it is likely that more units would be
held at the retail level, but multiechelon methods help determine how many to hold at the retailers,
and how many to hold at the warehouse.
11.2 Structure and Coordination
In this section, we provide a framework for supply chain management issues by brieﬂy discussing
structural and coordination decisions. Structural decisions are those that focus on longer-term,
strategic issues and parallel the longer-term management levers described in Chapter 2. These
decisions are typically made infrequently because they involve high costs to implement and change.
Some structural decisions include
■Where to locate factories, warehouses, and retail sites?
■How many of these facilities to have?

490
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
■What capacity should each of these facilities have?
■When, and by how much, should capacity be expanded or contracted?
■Which facilities should produce and distribute which products?
■What modes of transportation should be used for which products, and under which
circumstances?
The result of these structural decisions is a network of facilities designed to produce and dis-
tribute the products under consideration. Other parameters, such as lead times and some costs,
used in our models are determined as well. The models we develop can be used to evaluate alterna-
tive structures. For example, customer service personnel often argue for having numerous stocking
points close to customers. However, this leads to duplication of eﬀort, extra carrying costs, and
possibly extra transportation costs. The required inventory capacities and related costs of diﬀerent
options can be evaluated by the procedures of this chapter.*
Coordination decisions are usually taken after the structural decisions are made. Whereas
structural decisions tend to be based on long-term, deterministic approximations, coordina-
tion decisions take the structure of the multiechelon network as given and focus on the short
term. Therefore, they often must account for probabilistic demand and lead times. Coordination
decisions include
■Should inventory stocking and replenishment decisions be made centrally or in a decentral-
ized fashion?
■Should inventory be held at central warehouses or should these simply be used as break-bulk
facilities?
■Where should inventory be deployed? In other words, should most inventory be held at a
central location, or should it be pushed “forward” to the retail level?
■How should a limited and insuﬃcient amount of stock be allocated to diﬀerent locations
that need it?
In addition, the four questions noted in Chapter 6 (how important is the item; periodic or
continuous review; what form should the inventory policy take; and what speciﬁc cost and ser-
vice goals should be set) fall in the coordination category as well. Clearly, the decisions are quite
complex, and we cannot cover all of them in this chapter. However, we will present some models
and insights that will help decision makers address some of the fundamental issues in supply chain
management.
As a ﬁnal comment, we note that costs associated with structural decisions primarily include
ﬁxed operating costs, but also some variable operating costs and certain transportation costs. Costs
associated with coordination decisions include variable operating costs, inventory costs (hold-
ing and shortage), emergency transportation costs, and replenishment costs. General reviews by
Clark (1972); Goyal and Gunasekaran (1990); Axsäter (1993a); Federgruen (1993); Diks et al.
(1996); Thomas and Griﬃn (1996); and Gunasekaran et al. (2004) should be helpful for further
information.
* Research relevant to structural decisions includes Arntzen et al. (1995); Cohen et al. (1995); Graves and Willems
(2003b); Meixell and Gargeya (2005); and Graves and Willems (2005).

11.3 Deterministic Demand
In this section, we deal with the relatively simple situation in which the external demand rates are
known with certainty. This is admittedly an idealization, but it is important to study for several
reasons. First, the models will reveal the basic interactions among replenishment quantities at the
diﬀerent echelons. Second, as in earlier chapters, the deterministic case can serve as a basis for estab-
lishing replenishment quantities for the probabilistic case. Finally, the production environment can
occasionally be approximated by deterministic demand and production rates. We also assume that
replenishment lead times are known and ﬁxed.
11.3.1 Sequential Stocking Points with Level Demand
Consider the simplest of multiechelon situations, namely, where the stocking points are serially
connected—for example, one central warehouse, one retailer warehouse, and one retail outlet.
Another interesting production interpretation is depicted in Figure 11.3. An item progresses
through a series of operations, none of which are of an assembly or splitting nature; that is, each
operation has only one predecessor and only one successor operation. For exposition purposes, we
restrict ourselves to the most simple case of but two stages, denoted by a warehouse (W ) and a
retailer (R). Let us introduce some preliminary notation:
D = deterministic, constant demand rate at the retailer, in units/unit time (normally 1
year)
AW = ﬁxed (setup) cost associated with a replenishment at the warehouse, in dollars
AR = ﬁxed (setup) cost associated with a replenishment at the retailer, in dollars
vW = unit variable cost or value of the item at the warehouse, in $/unit
vR = unit variable cost or value of the item at the retailer, in $/unit
r = carrying charge, in $/$/unit time
QW = replenishment quantity at the warehouse, in units
QR = replenishment quantity at the retailer, in units
The two controllable (or decision) variables are the replenishment sizes QW and QR.
Figure 11.4 shows the behavior of the two levels of inventory with the passage of time for the
particular case where QW = 3QR. A little reﬂection shows that at least for the case of deterministic
demand it never would make sense to have QW anything but an integer multiple of QR. Therefore,
we can think of two alternative decision variables QR and n where
QW = nQR
n = 1, 2, . . .
(11.1)
Note that from Figure 11.4 the inventory at the warehouse does not follow the usual sawtooth
pattern even though the end usage is deterministic and constant with time. The reason is that the

withdrawals from the warehouse inventory are of size QR. We could carry out an analysis using the
conventional deﬁnitions of inventories, but the determination of average inventory levels becomes
complicated. Instead, it is easier to use a diﬀerent concept, known as echelon stock, introduced by
Clark and Scarf (1960). They deﬁne the echelon stock of echelon j (in a general multiechelon
system) as the number of units in the system that are at, or have passed through, echelon j but have
as yet not been speciﬁcally committed to outside customers. When backorders are permitted, the
echelon stock can be negative. With this deﬁnition and uniform end-item demand, each echelon
stock has a sawtooth pattern with time, as illustrated in Figure 11.4; thus, it is simple to compute
the average value of an echelon stock. However, we cannot simply multiply each average echelon
stock by the standard vr term and sum to obtain total inventory carrying costs. The reason is that
the same physical units of stock can appear in more than one echelon inventory. For example,
in our two-stage process, the actual ﬁnished inventory is counted in both the ﬁnished echelon
inventory and the warehouse echelon inventory. The way around this dilemma is to value any
speciﬁc echelon inventory at only the value added at that particular echelon.* When the decision
* In the deterministic demand case, echelon stock policies dominate installation stock policies, see Axsäter and
Juntti (1996, 1997). (Installation stocks are simply the stocks at the given location, without regard for downstream
stocks.) But in certain cases with probabilistic demand, the opposite might be true, particularly if the lead time
to the warehouse is short relative to the lead time to the retailers. Moreover, when there is more than one retail
outlet and transshipments are not possible, basing a replenishment action at the wholesale level on its echelon
stock position is not likely to be optimal when the inventories at the branches are markedly unbalanced.

being made is whether to store inventory at an upstream location or at a downstream location that it
supplies, the relevant holding cost is the incremental cost of moving the product to the retailer. This
incremental cost is exactly the echelon holding cost. (Problem 11.2 is concerned with showing that
this is equivalent to using the usual deﬁnitions of inventory levels and stock valuations.) Thus, in
our two-stage example, the warehouse echelon inventory is valued at v′
W = vW , while the retailer
echelon inventory is valued at only v′
R = vR −vW . More generally, in a production assembly
context, the echelon valuation v′ at a particular stage i is given by

11.3.1.1 Numerical Illustration of the Logic
Let us consider a particular liquid product, which a ﬁrm buys in bulk, then breaks down and
repackages. So, in this case, the warehouse corresponds to the inventory prior to the repackag-
ing operation, and the retailer corresponds to the inventory after the repackaging operation. The
demand for this item can be assumed to be essentially deterministic and level at a rate of 1,000
liters per year. The unit value of the bulk material (v′
W or vW ) is $1/liter, while the value added by
the transforming (break and package) operation v′
R = (vR −vW ) is $4/liter. The ﬁxed component
of the purchase charge (AW ) is $10, while the setup cost for the break and repackage operation
(AR) is $15. Finally, the estimated carrying charge is 0.24 $/$/year.

In other words, we purchase 334 liters* at a time; one-half of these or 167 liters are immediately
broken and repackaged. When these 167 (ﬁnished) liters are depleted, a second break and repackage
run of 167 liters is made. When these are depleted, we start a new cycle by again purchasing 334
liters of raw material.
11.3.1.2 Additional Research
See Roundy (1985) for research directly related to this problem. In other related research, Rosen-
blatt and Lee (1985) study a supplier with a single customer having level demand. The customer
uses the EOQ for placing orders, and the supplier provides a discount of the form a −bQ, where
Q is the order quantity of the customer. The supplier’s order quantity is kQ, where k is an integer.
Their model ﬁnds b and k so as to maximize the supplier’s proﬁt. See also Lee and Rosenblatt
(1986); Moily (1986); Chakravarty and Martin (1988); Goyal and Gupta (1989); Dobson and
Yano (1994); Kohli and Park (1994); Atkins and Sun (1995); Weng (1995); Aderohunmu et al.
(1995); Desai (1996); Gurnani (1996); Lam and Wong (1996); and Chen and Zheng (1997b).
11.3.2 Other Results for the Case of Level Demand
For the serial situation described in the previous subsection, Szendrovits (1975) proposes a dif-
ferent type of control procedure—namely, where the same lot size is used at all operations but
subbatches can be moved between operations. This allows an overlap between operations, and
therefore reduces the manufacturing cycle time. He shows that, under certain conditions, this type
of control procedure can outperform that proposed in the preceding subsection.
A number of authors have looked at systems more general in nature than the serial. Schwarz
(1973) deals with a one-warehouse, n-retailer situation (depicted in Figure 11.5 for n = 4). For
n ≥3, he shows that the form of the optimal policy can be very complex; in particular, it requires
that the order quantity at one or more of the locations vary with time even though all relevant
demand and cost factors are time-invariant. He rightfully argues for restricting attention to a sim-
pler class of strategies (where each location’s order quantity does not change with time) and develops
an eﬀective heuristic for ﬁnding quite good solutions.
* Of course, it may make sense to round this quantity to a convenient shipment size such as 350 liters. In such a
case, QR would also be adjusted (to 175 liters).

A “pure” assembly system.
Schwarz and Schrage (1975) adopt essentially the same approach for another type of deter-
ministic situation—namely, “pure” assembly* (each node feeds into, at most, one other node
as portrayed in Figure 11.6). These authors make use of a “myopic” strategy where each node
and its successor are treated in isolation by much the same procedure as for the two-stage serial
case discussed in the preceding section. Graves and Schwarz (1977) perform a similar analysis for
arborescent systems, which are just the opposite of a “pure” assembly system—now each node has,
at most, one node feeding into it.
Williams (1981, 1983) treats the general situation of an assembly network feeding into
an arborescent system (assembly production followed by distribution). Maxwell and Muckstadt
(1985) address the same problem but impose several restrictions (based on practical considerations)
on the nature of the policy to be used, speciﬁcally:
1. The policy is nested—that is, a replenishment cannot occur at an operation unless one also
occurs at immediate successor operations.
2. The policy is stationary—that is, the time between replenishments at each stage is a constant.
3. A base planning period (e.g., a shift, day, week) exists, and all reorder intervals must be an
integer multiple of this base period.
4. The time between replenishments at any particular stage must be 1, 2, 4, 8, . . . times the
interval between replenishments at any immediately following stage. This is the “powers of
2” restriction encountered in Section 10.4.2 of Chapter 10.
The resulting mathematical formulation results in a large, nonlinear, integer programming
problem, but the authors suggest an eﬃcient, specialized solution procedure. See also Muckstadt
and Roundy (1987) and Iyogun (1992).
11.3.3 Multiechelon Stocking Points with Time-Varying Demand
Here, we return to the demand situation assumed in Chapter 5 where end-item usage is known
but varies from period to period [D(j) in period j]. Also, carrying costs are incurred only on period-
ending inventories. However, now we have a multiechelon assembly or distribution system. Our

discussion is based on the work of Blackburn and Millen (1982) speciﬁcally for an assembly struc-
ture. Moreover, for illustrative purposes, we concentrate on the simple two-stage serial process used
in Section 11.3.1. (The more general case can be found in the Blackburn and Millen reference.)
One approach would be simply to use one of the procedures of Chapter 5 sequentially echelon
by echelon. For example, the Silver–Meal heuristic could be utilized to schedule replenishments for
the retailer (or the ﬁnished item in a production context). This would imply a pattern of require-
ments for the warehouse (or the primary processing stage in production), which would then be
used as input to the Silver–Meal heuristic to plan the replenishments of the warehouse.* Although
this approach is simple, it ignores the cost interdependency of the two echelons. Speciﬁcally, in
choosing the replenishment strategy at the retailer the method does not take account of the cost
implications at the warehouse.
Recognizing the above deﬁciency, we wish to develop a procedure that can still be applied
sequentially (to keep implementation eﬀort at a reasonable level) but that captures the essence of
the cost interdependencies. An examination of the level demand case provides considerable insight.
In particular, we repeat Equation 11.4 here:
TRC(QW , QR) = D
QR

AR + AW
n

+ QRr
2 (nv′
W + v′
R)
(11.8)
where
QW = nQR
(11.9)
Equation 11.8 is analogous to a single echelon problem (the selection of QR) if the adjusted
ﬁxed cost of a replenishment is
ˆAR = AR + AW
n
(11.10)
and the adjusted unit variable cost of the item is
ˆvR = nv′
W + v′
R
(11.11)
Note that the term AW /n reﬂects that there is a warehouse setup at only every nth retailer
setup. We can select QR (see Equation 11.7), including properly taking account of the cost impact
at the warehouse, if we have a good preestimate of n. We could use Steps 1–3 of the algorithm
in Section 11.3.1, but Blackburn and Millen have found that simply using Equation 11.5 and
ensuring that n is at least unity works well (particularly in more complex assembly structures).
Thus we have
n = max

AW v′

ARv′

$
(11.12)
Returning to the time-varying demand situation, we compute n using Equation 11.12; then,
employ the n value to obtain adjusted setup and unit variable costs for the retailer according to
Equations 11.10 and 11.11. The Silver–Meal heuristic can then be applied to the retailer using ˆAR
* Because of batching at the retailer, the resulting requirements pattern at the warehouse level is likely to contain
a number of periods with no demand. As mentioned in Section 5.6.7 of Chapter 5, the unmodiﬁed Silver–Meal
heuristic should be used with caution under such circumstances.

and ˆvR. The resulting replenishments again imply a requirements pattern for the warehouse. Sub-
sequently, the Silver–Meal, or another, lot-sizing procedure is used at the warehouse with AW and
vW . We next show a numerical illustration. Problem 11.4 also presents a full numerical example.
11.3.3.1 Numerical Illustration
To illustrate the computation of ˆAR and ˆvR, consider a two-stage process where AW = $30, Ar =
$20, vW = $2/unit, and vr = $7/unit. First, from Equation 11.2, we have
v′
R = vR −vW = $5/unit
v′
W = vW = $2/unit
Then, using Equation 11.12, we obtain
n = max

Finally, Equations 11.10 and 11.11 give us

1.94 = $35.46
and
ˆvR = 1.94(2.00) + 5.00 = $8.88/unit

11.4 Probabilistic Demand
Probabilistic demand raises several new issues and creates extreme modeling complexities in
a multiechelon inventory situation. For discussion purposes, we examine the relatively simple
three-echelon distribution system depicted in Figure 11.7.

A multiechelon situation with single-stage information flow.
The replenishment lead times between adjacent levels (in each case assuming that the feeding
level has adequate stock) are as follows:
Branch to retailer—1 week
Central to branch—1 week
Supplier to central—3 weeks
Straightforward use of the methods of Chapters 4 through 6 would dictate that each stocking
level (retailer, branch warehouse, and central warehouse) would independently make replenishment
decisions based on its own:
1. Cost factors and service considerations
2. Predicted demand—presumably forecasts based on historical demand that it has observed
from the next stocking point downstream
3. Replenishment lead time from the next stocking point upstream
Such a system has three serious ﬂaws. First, the lead time observed at, say, the retailer is depen-
dent on whether the branch warehouse has suﬃcient stock to ﬁll the order. If stock is available, the

500
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
lead time is simply the transportation time plus any order processing time. If the branch is out of
stock, the lead time could be as long as the branch’s lead time plus the transportation time to the
retailer. Second, as discussed in Section 11.3.1, it ignores the cost implications at one echelon of
using certain ordering logic at another level. Third, even if end-customer demand is fairly smooth,
the orders placed farther up the line become progressively larger and less frequent.
Other complicating factors include
1. How do we deﬁne service in a multiechelon situation? Normally, service is measured only at
the lowest echelon. In a multiechelon system, a stockout at one of the higher echelons has
only a secondary eﬀect on service: it may lengthen the lead time for a lower echelon, which
ultimately may cause customer disservice. We can see that safety stock at a particular echelon
has eﬀects on stockouts at other echelons. Thus, we have to be careful to avoid unnecessary
duplication of safety stocks.
2. Suppose that the branch warehouse places orders of size Qb on the central warehouse. What
happens when such an order is placed and the on-hand stock at the central location is less
than Qb? Is a partial shipment made or does the system wait until the entire order can be
shipped?
3. What about the possibility of an emergency shipment directly from the central warehouse to
the retailer?
4. In more complicated multiechelon structures, transshipments between points at the same
echelon may be possible, for example, between retailers in Figure 11.5.
5. Again, for more complicated structures when one central facility supplies several diﬀerent
stocking points at the next echelon, the central facility is likely to adopt a rationing policy
when it faces multiple requests with insuﬃcient stock to meet them all. Section 11.4.3 will
speciﬁcally address this issue.
Researchers have developed several fundamental approaches to dealing with these complex-
ities. One is to approximate the complex problem by simpler, and more easily solved versions.
The METRIC model and extensions, to be discussed in Section 11.5.1, are examples. A second
approach is to restrict the inventory policy to, say, the nested procedure discussed in Section 11.3.1.
The model discussed in Section 11.4.2 employs this approach. In either case, however, the basic
problem of establishing the linkages among echelons is critical. Three fundamental approaches
have been developed. The ﬁrst is most widely used and ﬁnds or approximates the distribution
of the lead time observed by a downstream facility. See Section 11.4.2 for example. The second
ﬁnds, or approximates, the distribution of the total number of orders outstanding at all retailers.
These are then disaggregated to ﬁnd the approximate number of orders outstanding at each retailer.
The model described in Section 11.5.1 follows this approach. The third tracks each demand unit
and matches it with a supply unit, calculating costs from the information obtained. Svoronos
and Zipkin (1988); Axsäter (1993b); and Chen and Zheng (1997a) are papers that use this
approach.
Despite all of the above complexities, Muckstadt and Thomas (1980) argue that it is indeed still
worthwhile to use multiechelon control procedures. These authors show substantial beneﬁts in a
military supply context, and Lawrence (1977) does the same for a commercial distribution system.
Arguing for the other side, Hausman and Erkip (1994) demonstrate that appropriately modiﬁed
single echelon models lead to small cost penalties for a data set of low-volume, high-cost items. It
is clear, however, that in many instances multiechelon techniques are valuable and can lead to large
improvements in cost and service.

Two dimensions will be useful as we proceed: local versus global information, and centralized
versus decentralized control. Local information implies that each location sees demand only in the
form of orders that arrive from the locations it directly supplies. Also, it has visibility of only its own
inventory status, costs, and so on. Global information implies that the decision maker has visibility
of the demand, costs, and inventory status of all the locations in the system. Centralized control
implies that attempts are made to jointly optimize the entire system, usually by the decisions of one
individual or group. Centralized control is often identiﬁed with “push” systems, because a central
decision maker pushes stock to the locations that need it most. Decentralized control implies that
decisions are made independently by separate locations. Decentralized control is often identiﬁed
with “pull” systems because independent decision makers pull stock from their suppliers. (See Pyke
and Cohen 1990.)
The best solutions are obtained by using global information and centralized control because the
decisions are made with visibility to the entire system using information for all locations. Unexpect-
edly large replenishment orders from downstream are eliminated. However, these solutions require
cooperation and coordination across multiple parties within operations, across functions, and, in
some cases, across ﬁrms. We address coordination across ﬁrms in Chapter 12.
If a ﬁrm is faced with decentralized control and local information, one good approach is for
each location to use the methods of Chapters 4 through 7, probably with the probabilistic lead time
formulas of Section 6.10 of Chapter 6. Beneﬁts can be gained from sharing information even if
control remains decentralized. Section 11.4.1 discusses a system that assumes decentralized control
and global information.
11.4.1 Base Stock Control System
The base stock system is a response to the diﬃculties of each echelon deciding when to reorder
based only on demand from the next lower echelon. The key change is to make end-item demand
information available for decision making at all stocking points, as illustrated in Figure 11.8. This
requires the use of an eﬀective communication system that provides timely and accurate infor-
mation; it also requires a high level of trust across the supply chain so that ﬁrms are willing
to share potentially sensitive information. Each stocking point makes replenishments based on
actual end-item customer demands rather than on replenishment orders from the next level down-
stream. With this modiﬁcation, the procedures of Chapters 4 through 6 are now more appropriate
to use.
The most common type of base stock system, in the research literature as well as in practice,
is one in which an order-up-to policy is used. Order-up-to policy systems were introduced in
Chapter 6 where decisions for any particular stocking point were based only on its stock position
and its direct demand process. Here, we present a more general (s, S) system, more appropriate in
a multiechelon situation. For each stocking point treated independently, an order quantity, Q, is
established (using end-item demand forecasts) by one of the methods of Chapters 4 and 5. Next,
a reorder point s is established by one of the procedures of Chapter 6, using end-item demand
forecasts over the replenishment lead time appropriate to the echelon under consideration. (For
example, the central warehouse would use a lead time of 3 weeks.) Then, the order-up-to-level S,
also called the base stock level, is determined through the relation
S = s + Q

Figure 11.8
Information and stock flow in a base stock system.
In terms of physical operation, the echelon inventory position at each level is monitored
according to the following relation:
Echelon inventory position = (Echelon stock) + (On order)
(11.14)
where, as deﬁned earlier, the echelon stock of echelon j is the number of units in the system that
are at, or have passed through, echelon j but have as yet not been speciﬁcally committed to outside
customers.
The “on-order” term in Equation 11.14 refers to an order placed by echelon j on the next
higher echelon. To illustrate, suppose that at a point in time the physical stocks of our example
(Figure 11.8) are:
Branch warehouse—50 units
Retail outlet—20 units
Furthermore, suppose that 5 units of known customer demand have not yet been satisﬁed.
Moreover, assume that there is no order outstanding from the branch on the central warehouse and

Multiechelon Inventory Management
■
503
that 10 units are in transit between the branch and the retail outlet. Then, the echelon inventory
position for the branch warehouse level would be
Inventory position = (50 + 10 + 20 −5) + (0) = 75 units
The echelon inventory position is reviewed after each transaction or on a periodic basis. (In the
latter case, the replenishment lead time for safety stock calculations at each level must be increased
by the review interval.) Once the echelon inventory position is known, it is compared with the
reorder point s. Whenever it is at or lower than s, enough is ordered from the preceding echelon to
raise the position to the base stock level S.
To repeat, ordering decisions at any stocking point in the base stock system are made as a result
of end-item demand, not as a result of orders from the next level downstream. There is much less
variability in the former than in the latter; hence, signiﬁcantly lower safety stocks (reduced carrying
costs) are achieved by the base stock system.
11.4.2 Serial Situation
For the special case of a serial system (such as in Figure 11.3), De Bodt and Graves (1985) propose
a procedure for computing the replenishment quantities and reorder points that explicitly takes
account of the eﬀects of the stock at one echelon on the lead time at the next lower echelon. Their
model assumes that demand information is available to all locations (global information), and that
decisions are made centrally (centralized control). Again, for illustrative purposes and consistency
with Section 11.3.1, we restrict our description to the case of two stages and call them warehouse
and retailer. The assumptions underlying the decision rules include
1. External demand occurs only at the retailer and is a stationary process. Conceptually, the
method can certainly be applied to a process that changes slowly with time where we have
estimates of the mean and standard deviation of demand over suitable durations of time. We
assume normally distributed forecast errors.
2. There is a deterministic replenishment lead time associated with each stage (LW and LR).
Furthermore, the lead time LR only begins when there is suﬃcient warehouse stock available
to fulﬁll a retailer replenishment.
3. The policy used is of the (s, Q) form, that is, continuous review with four parameters:
sW = reorder point (based on the echelon inventory position) at the warehouse
QW = order quantity at the warehouse
sR = reorder point at the retailer
QR = order quantity at the retailer
Furthermore, for our purposes, we assume that QR and QW = nQR have been predetermined
by the procedure of Section 11.3.1. (De Bodt and Graves suggest an iterative scheme to simulta-
neously ﬁnd the Q’s and s’s, similar to what was shown in Section 7.3 of Chapter 7.) Note that
the restriction, QW = nQR, implies that the policies are nested: when the warehouse orders, the
retailer also orders.
The decision rules for choosing sR and sW are:
1. Select sR such that
sR = ˆxLR + kRσLR
(11.15)

504
■
Inventory and Production Management in Supply Chains
where
ˆxLR = expected (forecast) demand over a retailer lead time
σLR = standard deviation of forecast errors over the same interval
kW = retailer safety factor, which satisﬁes
pu≥(kR) = QR(vR −vW )r
B2vRD
(11.16)
with D being the annual demand rate for the item, r the carrying charge in $/$/year, and
B2 the fraction of unit value charged per unit short. Note the similarity to Equation 6.22 of
Chapter 6.
2. Select sW such that
sW = ˆxLW +LR + kW σLW +LR
(11.17)
where
ˆxLW +LR = expected demand over a warehouse lead time, plus a retailer lead time
σLW +LR = standard deviation of forecast errors over the same interval
kW = warehouse safety factor, which satisﬁes
pu≥(kW ) = QR[vR + (n −1)vW ]r
B2vRD
(11.18)
The v expression in the numerator of Equation 11.16 is equivalent with an echelon valuation.
The LW + LR combination occurs in Equation 11.17 because on every nth replenishment at the
retailer, we have an associated warehouse replenishment, and the latter should be initiated when
there is suﬃcient echelon stock to protect against shortages over a period of length LW + LR
(recall assumption 2). The derivation of Equation 11.18 (see De Bodt and Graves 1985) uses
echelon stocks and hinges on distinguishing this special replenishment from the other n−1 retailer
replenishments. Note that the right-hand side of Equation 11.16 is always smaller than that of
Equation 11.18. Hence, the safety factor at the retailer is always larger than the safety factor at the
warehouse level.
11.4.2.1 Numerical Illustration
We use the same example as in Section 11.3.1, the liquid product that the ﬁrm buys in bulk (the
warehouse inventory), then breaks down and repackages (the retailer inventory). Suppose that the
purchasing lead time is 6 weeks and the lead time for the retailer—that is, for repackaging—is
1 week. Also, assume that forecast errors are normally distributed with the σ for 1 week being 6.4
units, and that σt = √tσ1. From Section 12.3.1, we know that the annual demand rate is 1,000
liters, vW = $1/liter, vr = $5/liter, r = 0.24 $/$/year, n = 2, and QR = 167 liters. Finally,
suppose that the fractional charge per unit short, B2, is set at 0.35. From Equation 11.16, we
obtain
pu≥(kR) = (167)(5.00 −1.00)(0.24)
(0.35)(5.00)(1,000)
= 0.0916
Then, Table II.1 in Appendix II gives
kR = 1.33
