About the Author
Mary Jane Sterling is the author of four other For Dummies titles: Algebra For
Dummies, Algebra II For Dummies, Trigonometry For Dummies, and Math Word
Problems For Dummies. She has honed her math-explaining skills during her
years of teaching mathematics at all levels: junior high school, high school,
and college. She has been teaching at Bradley University, in Peoria, Illinois,
for almost 30 of those years.
When not teaching or writing, Mary Jane keeps busy by working with her
Kiwanis Club, advising Bradley University’s Circle K Club, and working with
members of the Heart of Illinois Aktion Club (for adults with disabilities).
All the volunteer projects taken on for these clubs help keep her busy and
involved in the community.
Dedication
I dedicate this book to my two business math inspirations. First, to my son,
Jon, who came up with the idea of writing a book for business professionals
who needed a refresher — specifically for his real estate workforce. And
second, to my husband, Ted, who is the financial guru of the family and has
had years of experience in the business and financial arena.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I give a big thank you to Stephen Clark, who took on this project and never
ceased to be encouraging and upbeat. Also to Jessica Smith, a wonderful
wordsmith and cheerful copy editor; her wonderful perspective and insights
will pay off big time for the readers. Thank you to Technical Editor Benjamin
Schultz who helped out so much by keeping the examples in this book realis-
tic and the mathematics correct. Thank you to Lindsay Lefevere who took the
initial suggestion and molded it into a workable project. And thank you to
Composition Services, who took some pretty complicated equations and laid
them out in the most readable forms.

Business Math For Dummies

Introduction
B
usiness and mathematics — they just seem to go together. Of course, 
I could make a case for any topic to successfully mesh with math. Then
again, I’m a bit prejudiced. But you have to agree that you can’t do much in
the home or in the business or real estate worlds without a good, solid math-
ematical background.
I became interested in writing Business Math For Dummies because of Jon,
one of my children. He works with real estate agents and managers, and over
time he heard a recurring complaint: This or that agent hadn’t done math in a
long time and couldn’t remember how to do the proper computations. Sure,
computers and calculators do the actual arithmetic, but you have to know
what to enter into the computer or calculator. Finding the area of a circular
garden isn’t terribly difficult if you know how to use the formula for the area
of a circle, but it can be tricky if you haven’t used that formula in a long time.
For instance, you may not remember what pi is (and I don’t mean the apple
or cherry variety). And who would have thought that you’d ever need to
solve a proportion after you grew up and got a job? The math in the business
world isn’t difficult, but it does take a refresher or a bit of relearning. And
here you find it — all in one spot.
In this book, you find tons of mathematical explanations coupled with some
sample business or financial problems. I show you the steps used in the math
and explain how the answers help you complete a transaction or continue on
with a project.
About This Book
In your business, you probably have all sorts of specialized procedures and
formulas. And you’re probably pretty good at what’s particular to your situa-
tion. So what you find in this book is all the background info for more special-
ized material. I show you how to do financial computations that use simple
formulas along with other more-involved formulas. You’ll find geometric
structures and patterns and uses of fractions, decimals, and percents.
Having said all that, I doubt you want to read this book from cover to cover.
After all, no snooze alarm is loud enough to rouse you if you attempt a front-
to-back read. But if you love math that much, please feel free to make this a
pleasure read. However, most folks simply will go to those topics that interest
or concern them.

This modularity is what’s so great about this book. You can jump backward
or forward to your heart’s delight. In fact, I refer to earlier material in later
chapters (if I think it would help explain the topic at hand), and I titillate you
early on with promises of exciting applications further on as you read. In
other words, you’ll find the organization to be such that you can quickly turn
to the pages you need as you need them.
Please use this book as a reference or a study guide. You don’t want to memo-
rize the formulas and procedures shown here. If you did, your head would
surely burst.
Conventions Used in This Book
This book is designed to be user friendly. I’m guessing that you’re too busy to
have to hunt up a dictionary if a word isn’t familiar or to poke around for a
formula (and how to use it) if you need to determine an item’s markup or a
loan’s payment amount.
So as you read this book, you’ll see important terms highlighted with italics,
and I always include a definition with these terms. Boldfaced text highlights
keywords of bulleted lists and the actions you must take in numbered steps.
Also, when a process requires a formula, I state the formula and identify all
the letters and symbols.
What You’re Not to Read
Occasionally in this book you’ll see some material accompanied by a
Technical Stuff icon. And you’ll come across some sidebars, which are those
gray-shaded boxes with interesting but nonessential information. You’ll find
these items when I just couldn’t help myself — I had to tell you about some
mathematical property, geometric eccentricity, or financial feature because 
I found it to be so fascinating. Do you need the information in order to under-
stand the process? No. Will it enlighten you and make your world a better
place? Well, of course. You can take them or leave them; pass them by today
and come back to them in the future — or not.
Foolish Assumptions
I find that separating my foolish assumptions from my realistic assumptions
is really difficult. After all, what you may consider to be foolish, I may con-
sider to be realistic (and vice versa). But let me tell you what I think, and you
can do the sorting.

Business Math For Dummies 

I’m assuming that you have access to at least a simple scientific calculator.
You really can’t do some of the problems involving powers, radicals, and
huge numbers without the help of a calculating device. So, you’re really
handy with an abacus? All the more power to you — but I think you still want
to invest in a calculator. Similarly, computers and spreadsheet software pro-
grams aren’t a necessity, but I assume that you can use a computer, even if
you don’t have your own. After all, today’s financial world is handled pretty
much using spreadsheets with formulas embedded into them.
Most of the math in this book is arithmetic, but you also find some basic alge-
bra. Here’s the deal: You don’t need to solve tricky quadratic equations or
problems involving calculus, but I do assume that you understand how to
solve an equation such as 1,000 = 3x – 8 (by finding the value of x). Don’t
panic! I show you how to do these problems, but I assume that you’ve at least
seen the algebraic process before and just need a reason to use it.
How This Book Is Organized
Mathematics and business just seem to go together naturally, but I do try to
organize the different topics and techniques in this book, and I give you some
practical perspective of how they relate. Even when I start with the mathe-
matics in the beginning, you see how those basic math operations and tech-
niques relate to business topics; otherwise you wouldn’t be inspired to
continue reading the material! In all the chapters, I reference other topics
that are closely related to what you’re reading to save you time in your quest
for the information you need.
Part I: Reviewing Basic Math for Business
and Real Estate Transactions
The basic math of business is really the basic math of life. So, the chapters in
this part take you through the fundamentals of dealing with fractions, deci-
mals, percents, and proportions. You see how the different forms that a per-
cent can take are used to do computations necessary to be successful in
business. A little algebra is even thrown in to make the topics interesting.
Algebra is a rather cryptic language, but a simple translation is all you need
to make your way.

Introduction

Part II: Taking Intriguing Math to Work
Formulas make the world go ‘round — literally. But the formulas in this 
section mainly deal with money and financial situations, measurements, and
statistics. In this part, you see how to use formulas in spreadsheets, and you
find your way around statistical information.
Part III: Discovering the Math 
of Finance and Investments
The chapters in this part are, well, interesting. In other words, simple interest
and compound interest are used to a large extent in this part. You use formu-
las involving interest to determine how much an investment grows over time.
And you use interest to determine the extra expense involved when borrow-
ing money over different periods of time. Plus, no discussion of finance would
be complete without talking about stocks and bonds. You find the ins and
outs of their mathematics in this part. And, as promised, you find information
on promissory notes as an option for borrowing.
Part IV: Putting Math to Use 
in Banking and Payroll
Bank accounts are places to accumulate money and grow interest. You also
use them to make payments to suppliers or employees. In the chapters in
this part, you see variations on budgets and payroll management. Insurance
and valuation of assets both play a big part in the overall financial picture of
a business, which is why I include them in the general picture of managing
the income and outgo involved in running a business successfully.
Part V: Successfully Handling the Math
Used in the World of Goods and Services
Whether you’re on the buying end or the selling end of a business, you need
to understand that discounts, markups, overhead, and depreciation all play a
part in your business’s profits, revenue, and costs. So in this part, I show you
the mathematics involved and give you some examples. And because manag-
ing inventory is critical to the health of a company and its revenue figures, 
I explain methods for turnover and valuation.

Part VI: Surviving the Math for Business
Facilities and Operations
When purchasing property, you need accurate measurements, a fair assess-
ment of the value, and a reasonable mortgage payment. Also, you need to
secure a profitable rental amount if you’re leasing the property to others. You
find the math necessary for all the aspects of measuring, borrowing money
for, purchasing, and renting property in this part’s chapters.
Part VII: The Part of Tens
A For Dummies book isn’t complete without the Part of Tens. In this part, 
I include two top ten lists that give you quick, fun, and relevant information.
For instance, I provide ten tips for managing leases and rental property, as
well as a list of the ten main things to look for when reading a financial form. 
Icons Used in This Book
In the margins of this book, you see little pictures, which are called icons.
These icons highlight specific types of information. They aren’t meant to dis-
tract you. No, instead they’re meant to attract your attention to items that
warrant notice. Here are the icons I include and what they mean:
This icon calls your attention to situations and examples where the business
math that’s discussed is used in a sample situation.
This icon flags important information that you should keep in mind as you
read or solve a problem. I often use this icon to highlight a rule or formula
that you use in the current discussion. These rules or formulas are necessary
for the mathematical computation and are applicable to other problems
related to the topic.
When you see this icon, you’ll know that you’re coming upon a helpful or
time-saving tip.
You’ll find this icon attached to interesting but nonessential information. The
information next to this icon is loosely related to the discussion at hand but
isn’t necessary to your understanding of the topic.

Introduction

This icon points out a particularly sticky problem or common misunder-
standing. I use this icon sparingly so that, when you do see it, you know
I’m serious about the information.
Where to Go from Here
The range of topics in business mathematics (and therefore in this book) is
pretty broad. However, because of the large scope of material shown here,
you’ll be able to find what you need in one place or another. If you need some
help with the basics, feel free to start with the first part. Then jump to the
chapters that relate to your specific business situation. You just need to pick
and choose what you need from the different parts of this book (and then use
them or abuse them to your heart’s content).
As you’re reading through the book, remember that if you come across a par-
ticular mathematical process that you can’t quite remember, you can be sure
I refer you to the chapter that covers the process or something very much
like it. You can then apply the concepts or processes to your particular situa-
tion. Feel free to use this book as a reference more than a guide. It’s here to
clear up the puzzling points and get you set in the right direction.

T
he mathematics of fractions, decimals, and percents
is fully dissected and then put back together in
these chapters. Why? Well, the world of business is tied
to these topics. So, in this part, you investigate percent
increases and percent decreases, and you see how the
math goes right along with fractions and proportions. You
also discover how to create new ways of using percents
and proportions that you haven’t even considered.

usiness mathematics involves a lot of arithmetic, some algebra, a touch
of geometry, and dibs and dabs of other mathematical topics. But the
major portion of mathematics that’s found in business is arithmetic.
Getting you off to a good start is the goal of this chapter. You may be looking
for answers to some deep, dark mathematical secrets; this chapter helps you
light the way toward realizing that the basic math involved in business was
never meant to be kept a secret. You may not see the relevance in some
mathematical processes. But this chapter makes the necessity for mathemat-
ics abundantly clear.
On the other hand, you may have a firm grasp on the business math basics;
you’re looking for more — for some explanations as to why, not just how. So,
in this chapter, I show you many of these whys, and I direct you to even more
complex mathematics when the occasion allows.
Most of the math in business isn’t compartmentalized into one section or
another. Fractions and decimals are found in all applications. Proportions
and percents are rampant. And measurements are necessary for many 
different business processes. In other words, the math of business involves
computations shared by all the different aspects. The main trick to doing the
math is to know when to apply what. Use the material in this book to help
yourself become comfortable with when to use what and how to use it 
successfully.

Fracturing the Myths about Fractions,
Decimals, and Percents
It could be that adding fractions is something that you do every day; in that
case, fractions are fresh in your mind, and you find them easy to deal with.
On the other hand, you may not have found a common denominator in years
(and hope never to have to again). You also may have made it a point not to
deal with decimals. But fractions and decimals can’t be ignored; they need to
be embraced — or, at least, tolerated.
It’s an undeniable fact that fractions, decimals, and percents form the basis of
much of the math in business. Before you run away, screaming and sobbing,
let me tell you that in this book, I ease you into some of the less popular
mathematical subjects when they arise. I show you the way to deal with the
math in the most quick and efficient way possible.
In Part II of this book, you find fractions cropping up in formulas and with
various measurement situations. You probably never complained much when
told that you had to take half of an amount to complete a computation. After
all, a half is the simplest fraction. But, if you can manage one fraction, you
can manage them all. In Chapter 2, I go over some of the operations needed
with fractions, and I show you how to change them to percents and back
again.
Decimals are the middle ground between fractions and percents. You really
can’t get around them — nor do you really want to avoid them. When figuring
percent increases or decreases in Chapter 3, you see how the change from
percents to decimals is necessary. Discounts and markups are often confus-
ing to understand and compute, but Chapter 17 shows you how to handle the
ups and downs correctly using our good friends, the percent and decimal.
And how in the world can you deal with the interest earned on your account
unless you haul out those delightful decimals? When you compute simple
interest, you use the formula I = Prt. Nestled between the money amount 
(P stands for principal) and the number of years involved (t stands for time)
is the rate of interest, r, which is given as a percent and changed to a decimal
in order to do the computation.
You find percents and decimals cropping up throughout this book. If you
come across a conundrum (okay, even just a little challenge), you can always
refer to the chapters in Part I, which deal with fractions, decimals, percents,
and their basic applications and computations.

Part I: Reviewing Basic Math for Business and Real Estate Transactions 

Capitalizing on Patterns in Formulas
A formula is nothing more than a relationship between values that always
works and is always true. Wouldn’t it be nice if formulas worked for people,
too? But that’s the big difference between people and numbers. Numbers are
known to behave much better and more predictably than people, which is
why you can embrace formulas with such confidence.
Formulas have been around since the beginning of recorded history, but in
the Middle Ages, formulas weren’t in their current neat-and-compact forms. It
was only a couple hundred years ago that algebraic notation became popular
and formulas such as P = 2(l + w) and a2 + b2 = c2 became a part of mathemati-
cal history.
The trick to working with any formula is knowing what the different variables
stand for and how to perform the mathematical operations involved. For
example, you should know that A = 1⁄2bh gives you the area of a triangle. You
simply multiply one side of the triangle (the base, b) by the height of the tri-
angle (h, which is measured from the base) and then find 1⁄2 of the product.
(Check out Chapter 21 for more on the area formulas.)
In Chapter 5, I go over the different rules for performing more than one opera-
tion in an expression. In all of Part II, you see how to use formulas in different
settings. It’s a splendid situation when you can put a formula into a computer
spreadsheet and let the technology do repeated computations for you. So in
Chapter 5, I give you some spreadsheet guidance.
Get ready, because you can find some pretty impressive formulas in Parts III
and VI, where loans, mortgages, and other financial manipulations play a big
part in the discussion. You don’t want to memorize the formulas for annuities
and sinking funds, however. You just need to become comfortable using the
formulas and have confidence in your answers. You can always flip to the
actual formula when it comes time to use it.
You probably remember how to do a mean average, but do you know
whether the median or mode would be a better measure of the middle in your
particular situation? Just use the formulas or rules in this book to find out.
For instance, when you’re managing rental properties or another business,
you need to do some comparisons from month to month and year to year.
Your statistics skills, which you can gain in Chapter 8, will put you in good
stead for the computations needed. You don’t find any heavy-duty statistics
or statistical formulas in this book. For further investigations, check out
Statistics For Dummies (Wiley).

Chapter 1: Starting from the Beginning

Finding the Power in Exponents
An exponent is a power. In other words, it’s shorthand algebra that tells you
to multiply something by itself over and over again. Exponents are fundamen-
tal in compound interest formulas and amortized loan formulas. In fact,
they’re great for everything financial.
For example, do you want to know what an investment of $10,000 will be
worth in 5 years? Part III presents lots of options for dealing with your money
and for doing the computations necessary. Mortgage rates change constantly,
and so you often need to make decisions on your mortgages and loans. Those
decisions rely heavily on computations using exponents. You find the low-
down in Part III and, again, in Part VI.
Are you a little shaky on the use of exponents? Check out Table 1-1, which
gives you a quick reminder.

First off, change the radical to a fractional exponent. Then multiply the two
numbers together by adding the exponents like this:
93/2 · 91/2 = 93/2 +1/2 = 92 = 81
Okay, that was fun. But you may not be convinced that exponents are all that
important. What if I asked you to do a quick comparison of how much more
money you accumulate if you invest a certain lump sum for 10 years instead
of just 5 years? I show you how the exponents work in the following example.
(You can go to Chapter 9 to get more of the details.)
12
Part I: Reviewing Basic Math for Business and Real Estate Transactions 

Compare the amount of money accumulated if you deposit an insurance 
settlement for 10 years in an account earning 8% interest compounded 
quarterly versus just leaving that money in the account for 5 years (at the
same interest rate).
The formula for compound interest is:

To do the comparison of how much money accumulates, write a fraction with

the 5 years compounding in the denominator (the bottom). Here’s what your
math should look like:

Performing some reducing of fractions and operations on exponents, you see
that the amount of money accumulated is about 11⁄2 times as much as if it’s
left for 10 years (rather than for 5). You can also use the formula to get the
respective amounts of money for the two different investment times, but this
equation shows you the power of a power for any amount of money invested
at that rate and time.
Doing Some Serious Counting
Keeping track of your inventory means more than taking a clipboard to the
storeroom and counting the number of boxes that are there. Even a smaller
business needs a systematic way of keeping track of how many items it has,
how much the different items cost, and how quickly the items are used and
need to be replaced.
So, in Part V, you find information on inventory, overhead, and depreciation.
The amount of inventory on hand affects the cost of insurance, and, in turn,
the cost of insurance affects the overall profit. Profit is determined by finding
13
Chapter 1: Starting from the Beginning

the difference between revenue and cost. And each part of the profit equation
involves its own set of computations.
One of the best ways of keeping track of inventory and the related costs and
revenue is to use a computer spreadsheet. You get some formal explanations
on spreadsheets in Chapter 5. I also tell you throughout the book when the
use of spreadsheets is possible.
Other types of counting or tallying come in the form of measurements —
linear measurements, area, volume, and angles. You find uses for measuring
lengths and widths and areas when you’re building something new or reno-
vating something old. You need accurate area computations when you’re
planning for the space needed for production or a particular volume. That
way you can store what you’ve produced.
In these cases and more, you need to be able to switch from one measurement
unit to another — from feet to yards, for example — and apply the measures to
the correct situations. In Chapter 7, you find the basics of measuring, and you
apply these measures in the chapters dealing with insuring spaces, renting
properties, figuring acreage, and computing depreciation, just to name a few.
Painting a Pretty Picture
Many people are visual — they learn, understand, and remember better if
they have a picture of the situation. I’m one of those people — and proud of
it. Present a problem to me, and I’ll try to draw a picture of the situation,
even if it means drawing stick figures of Ted, Fred, and Ned to do a compari-
son of their salaries.
Pictures, charts, graphs, and tables are extremely helpful when trying to
explain a situation, organize information, or make quick decisions. You find
tables of values throughout this book. A table is a rectangular arrangement of
information with columns of items sharing some quality and rows of items
moving sequentially downward. Tables of information can be transformed
into spreadsheets or matrices so you can do further computations. (Matrices
aren’t covered in this book, but if you’d like, you can find information on
them in Algebra II For Dummies, published by Wiley.)
Charts and graphs are quick, pictorial representations of a bunch of numbers
or other numerical information. You don’t get exact values from charts or
graphs, but you get a quick, overall picture of what’s going on in the busi-
ness. You can find pie charts and line graphs and more in Chapter 6.

Chapter 2
Fractions, Decimals, and Percents
In This Chapter

 Performing basic operations on fractions
F
ractions, decimals, and percents are closely related to one another.
Every fraction has a percent equivalent, but you have to go through deci-
mals to get from fractions to percents or from percents to fractions. And,
although percents may be the most easy to understand of the three different
forms, you can’t really perform many operations involving percents without
changing them to one of the other forms. You may want to just do away with
all but one of these formats to avoid having to go through the hassle of doing
all the conversions. However, you really wouldn’t want to do that because
each format has a place in everyday life and business.
In this chapter, I show you the ins and outs of changing from one form to
another — fractions to decimals to percents, and back again. You’ll see why
the different formats are necessary and useful (and not evil).
Changing from Fractions to Decimals
Everyone loves fractions. In fact, you probably find it hard to believe that
anyone would ever want fractions to change! Okay. I jest. The practical
reason for changing from fractions to decimals is to aid in computations and
get a sense of the value. It’s easy to trip up when entering a fraction into an
arithmetic operation. But decimals work nicely in calculators. Also, the deci-
mal equivalents of many fractions are easier to compare. For example, which
is larger, 23⁄57 or 26⁄67? The decimal equivalent of 23⁄57 is about 0.404, and the equiv-
alent of 26⁄67 is about 0.388. Much easier to compare now, aren’t they?

Changing a fraction to a decimal is pretty straightforward — you just divide
until the division comes to a screeching halt or until you see a pattern repeat-
ing over and over. One or the other (ending or repeating) will always occur
when you start with a fraction.
Considering the two types of decimals
The two types of decimal numbers that arise from dividing a fraction’s
numerator by its denominator are terminating and repeating decimals. A ter-
minating decimal is just what it sounds like: it’s a decimal that comes to an
end. You may need to do a bit of dividing to come to that end, but you will
find the end. A repeating decimal is one that never ends. Instead, it repeats
itself over and over in a distinctive pattern. The pattern may contain one
digit, two digits, or a huge number of digits.
Terminating decimals
Terminating decimals are created from fractions whose denominators have
the following:
 Factors (divisors) of only 2 and 5
 Powers of 2 and 5
 Multiples of powers of 2 and 5
For example, the fraction 5⁄8 has a terminating decimal, because the number 8 
is 23, a power of 2. And the fraction 250
137 has a terminating decimal, because 
the number 250 is equal to 2 · 53, the product of 2 and a power of 5.
In general, you divide as many times as 2 or 5 are factors of the denominator.
For example, if the denominator is 16, which is the 4th power of 2, you divide
4 times. If the denominator is 3,125, the 5th power of 5, you divide 5 times. If
the denominator contains both powers of 2 and powers of 5, then the number
that has the higher power (the most factors) determines how many times you
divide.
Repeating decimals
When the denominator of a fraction has factors other than 2 or 5, the decimal
equivalent of the fraction always repeats. Always. For example, the fraction 1⁄3
has a decimal equivalent of 0.3333 . . . . The 3s go on forever. You indicate a
repeating decimal by showing enough of the numbers that it’s apparent
what’s repeating and then writing an ellipsis ( . . . ). Or, if you prefer, you can
draw a line across the top of the repeating digits.
16
Part I: Reviewing Basic Math for Business and Real Estate Transactions 

Here’s what I mean: The fraction 2⁄7 has a repeating decimal, .285714. All six
digits repeat; if you didn’t use the bar across the top, you’d write the decimal
equivalent as 0.285714285714 . . . . Doing so shows that the six digits repeat
over and over.
Find the decimal equivalent of the fraction 375
7 .
Divide 7 by 375, and continue until you find the repeating pattern. How do I
know it repeats? Because the denominator, 375, is divisible by 3 and 5 — the
3 factor causes the repeating part. When dividing the problem, your math will
look like this:
.
.
375 7 00000
375
3250
3000
2500
2250
2500
2250
250
01866
g
You see that, after the first few divisions, the remainder 250 keeps appearing
every time. The first three digits of the decimal don’t repeat, just the 6s. You’d
continue to get only 6s, so the decimal equivalent is written 0.018666 . . . or
.0 0186.
Rounding decimals up or down
When you change the fraction 1⁄4 to its decimal equivalent, you end up with a
nice, tame decimal of 0.25. But the fraction 1⁄6 has a repeating decimal equiva-
lent that never ends — 0.1666 . . . . You can even have terminating decimals 
that get a little long-winded. For example, the fraction 3125
79
has a decimal 
value of 0.02528, which isn’t all that long, but you may have more digits than
you think is necessary for the situation at hand.
Rounding off the extra decimal digits takes care of overly long numerical
values. Of course, rounding a decimal changes the number slightly. You’re
eliminating a more exact value when you drop pieces from the number. But
rounding decimals under the right circumstances is expedient and useful.
17
Chapter 2: Fractions, Decimals, and Percents

Suppose, for example, that you’re planning to cut a piece of wood into four
equal pieces. So you measure the wood, divide by four, and cut the pieces to
size. Consider a piece of wood measuring 6 feet, 33⁄8 inches. One-fourth of the
length of the board is 1 foot, 6.84375 inches. (Chapter 7 shows you how to
deal with feet and inches, and later in this chapter I show how to divide frac-
tions.) With that measurement in hand, you’re all set to create four pieces of
wood that measure 1 foot, 6.84375 inches each, right? Of course not. You
know that the sawdust accounts for at least the last three decimal digits of
the number. So, to make things a bit easier, you round off the measure to
about 1 foot, 6.8 inches, which is equal to about 1 foot, 67⁄8 inches.
When rounding decimals, you decide how many decimal places you want in
your number, and then you round to the nearer of that place and lop off the
rest of the digits. You can also use the Rule of 5 when rounding. I explain the
different ways to round in the following sections.
Rounding to the nearer digit
The rule for rounding is that you choose how many decimal digits you want
in your answer, and then you get rid of the excess digits after rounding up or
down. Before discarding the excess digits, use the following steps:
1. Count the number of digits to be discarded, and think of the power of
10 that has as many zeros as digits to discard.
2. Use, as a comparison, half of that power of 10.
For example, half of 10 is 5, half of 100 is 50, and so on.
3. Now consider the discarded digits.
If the amount being discarded is smaller than 5, 50, or 500 (and so on),
you just drop the extra digits. If the amount being discarded is larger
than 5, 50, or 500 (and so on), you increase the last digit of the number
you’re keeping by 1 and discard the rest. If you have exactly 5, 50, or 500
(and so on), you use a special rule, the Rule of 5, which I cover later in
this chapter.
In the following examples, I talk about rounding a number to the “nearer
tenth” or “nearer hundredth.” This naming has to do with the number of
placeholders present. To read more about this naming convention, check out
the later section, “Ending up with terminating decimals.”
Round the number 45.63125 to the nearer hundredth (leave two decimal
places).
18
Part I: Reviewing Basic Math for Business and Real Estate Transactions 

You want to keep the whole number, 45, and the first three digits to the right
of the decimal point — the 6 and, possibly, the 3. The digits left over form the
number 125. Because 125 is less than 500, just drop off those three digits. So
your answer is that 45.63125 rounds to 45.63 when it’s rounded to the nearer
hundredth.
Round the number 645.645645 . . . to the nearer thousandth (leave three deci-
mal places).
You want to keep the whole number, 645, to the left of the decimal point and
at least the first two digits to the right of the decimal point. You keep the 6
and 4 and make a decision about the 5. Because the numbers to be dropped
off represent 645 (or 6,456, 64,564, and so on), you see that the numbers to be
dropped off represent a number bigger than 500 (or 5,000, 50,000, and so on).
So you add 1 to the 5, the last digit, forming the rounded number 645.646 to
replace the repeating decimal part of the original number.
Round the number 1.97342 to the nearer tenth (leave one decimal place).
When you round, you’ll be dropping off the digits 7342, which represent a
number bigger than 5,000. So you add 1 to the 9. But 1 + 9 = 10, so you have to
carry the 1 from the 10 to the digit to the left of the decimal point. Your
resulting number is 2.0 after dropping the four digits off. You leave the 0 after
the decimal point to show that the number is correct (has been rounded) to
the nearer tenth.
Rule of 5
When you’re rounding numbers and the amount to drop off is exactly 5, 50, or
500 (and so on), you round either up or down, depending on which choice cre-
ates an even number (a number ending in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8). The reason for this
rule is that half the time you round up and half the time you round down —
making the adjustments due to rounding more fair and creating less of an
error if you have to repeat the process many times.
Round the number 655.555 to the nearer hundredth (leave two decimal
places).
Because there are only three digits, only the last digit needs to be dropped
off. And because you have exactly 5, you round the hundredth place to a 6,
giving you 655.56. Why? Rounding up gives you an ending digit that’s an even
number.

Chapter 2: Fractions, Decimals, and Percents

Converting Decimals to Fractions
Decimals have a much better reputation than fractions. Why, for the life of me,
I can’t understand. But many people do prefer the decimal point followed by a
neat row of digits. For most applications, the decimal form of a number is just
fine. For many precision computations, though, the exact form, a number’s
fractional value, is necessary. Those working with tools know that fractions
describe the different sizes (unless you’re working with the metric system).
Changing a decimal into a fraction takes a decision on your part. First, you
decide whether the decimal is terminating or repeating. Then, in the case of
the repeating decimal, you decide whether all the digits repeat or just some
of them do. What if the decimal doesn’t terminate or repeat and just goes on
forever and ever? Then you’re done. Only decimals that terminate or repeat
have fractional equivalents. The decimals that neither terminate nor repeat
are called irrational (how appropriate).
In the following sections, I explain how to change terminating and repeating
decimals into fractions. (For more information on irrational numbers, check
out the nearby sidebar “Discovering irrational numbers.”)
Ending up with terminating decimals
Terminating decimals occur when a fraction has the following in its 
denominator:
 Only factors of 2 or 5
 Powers of 2 or 5
 Products of powers of 2 or 5
A terminating decimal has a countable number of decimal places, and the
number formed has a name based on the number of decimal places being
used. The names of the first eight decimal places with a 1 place holder are:
0.1
one tenth
0.01
one hundredth
0.001
one thousandth
0.0001
one ten-thousandth
0.00001
one hundred-thousandth
0.000001
one millionth
0.0000001
one ten-millionth
0.00000001
one hundred-millionth
20
Part I: Reviewing Basic Math for Business and Real Estate Transactions 

So, for example, you read the number 0.003456 as three thousand four hundred
fifty-six millionths. The millionths comes from the position of the last digit in
the number. And, as a bonus, the names of the decimal places actually tell
you what to put in the denominator when you change a terminating decimal
to a fraction. How?
When changing a terminating decimal to its fractional equivalent, you place
the decimal digits over a power of 10 that has the same number of 0s as the
number of decimal digits. Then you reduce the fraction to lowest terms.
Check out the following example to see what I mean.
Rewrite the decimal 0.0875 as a fraction in its lowest terms.
The number 0.0875 is eight hundred seventy-five ten-thousandths. To rewrite
this number as a fraction, you put the digits 875 (you don’t need the lead
zero because 875 and 0875 are the same number) in the numerator of a frac-
tion and 10,000 in the denominator (you use 10,000 because there are 4 digits
to the right of the decimal point and 4 zeros in 10,000 ). Now reduce the frac-
tion. To do so, first divide the numerator and denominator by 25, and then
reduce the numerator and denominator by 5. The math should look like this:
,

10 000

Yes, I know that I could have reduced the fraction in one step by dividing
both the numerator and denominator by 125, but I don’t really know my mul-
tiples of 125 that well, so I chose to reduce the fractions in stages.
21
Chapter 2: Fractions, Decimals, and Percents
Discovering irrational numbers
It is our famous friend, Pythagoras, who’s often
given credit for discovering irrational numbers.
Even though the ancient Babylonians have sur-
viving documents that suggest that they were
also onto the idea, it was the Pythagoreans who
formalized the discovery with the irrationality of
the square root of 2. The proof involves taking a
square, drawing its diagonal, and setting up a
proportion between the sides of the square and
the diagonal. From the proportion, the
Pythagoreans produced the equation 2a2 = b2
and were able to argue that the equation has no
solution if a and b are integers. (Integers, by the
way, are positive and negative whole numbers
and 0.) Other references to the irrational
number proof show up in Aristotle’s works and
Euclid’s Elements. The irrational square root 
of 2 has a decimal that neither terminates 
nor repeats; here are the first 60 or so 
decimal places of the square root of 2:
1.41421356237309504880168872420969807856967
187537694807317667973799 . . . . If you want
more decimal places than appear here, go to
www.rossi.com\sqr2.htm.

Dealing with repeating decimals
Repeating decimals come from fractions. But unlike terminating decimals,
you can’t put the decimal part over a power of 10, because the decimal never
ends. In other words, it doesn’t settle down to a particular power of 10, so
you’d never stop putting zeros in the fraction.
Repeating decimals separate into two different groups or types. The first type
is the one in which all the digits repeat. You don’t have any start-off digits
that don’t fit in the repeating pattern. The second type of repeating decimal
consists of those that have one or more digits that appear just once and
don’t fit into the repeating pattern. Each group has its own way of converting
from decimals to fractions. I explain in the following sections.
Catching all the digits repeating
A decimal number in which all the digits repeat looks something like these:
0.88 . . .
0.123123 . . .
0.14851485 . . .
It doesn’t matter how many digits are in the repeating pattern. As long as all
the digits are a part of the pattern, the number falls into this first group of
repeating decimals.
To find the fractional equivalent of a repeating decimal in which all the digits
repeat, put the repeating digits into the numerator of a fraction, and put as
many 9s as there are digits in the repeating pattern in the denominator of the
fraction. Then reduce the fraction to lowest terms. Sounds pretty simple,
doesn’t it? Try your hand at the following example.
Find the fractional equivalents of 0.88 . . . and 0.123123 . . .
For the decimal 0.88 . . ., put an 8 in the numerator and a 9 in the denomina-
tor. You get the fraction 8⁄9, which is already in reduced form.
For the decimal 0.123123 . . ., put 123 in the numerator and 999 in the denomi-
nator. You reduce the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by
3. Here’s what your simplifying should look like:
999

999

Working with digits that don’t repeat in the pattern
Repeating decimals with nonrepeating parts look like the following:
0.00345345 . . .
0.12699999 . . .
0.32517842842842 . . .
The nonrepeating parts never show up again after the decimal starts repeat-
ing, but that part does affect how you determine the corresponding fraction.
You can’t put the nonrepeating part over 9s and you can’t put it over 0s. The
actual technique involves a bit of a compromise.
To find the fractional equivalent of a repeating decimal with one or more non-
repeating digits, follow these steps:
1. Set the decimal equal to N.
2. Multiply both sides of the equation by the power of 10 that has as
many zeros as there are nonrepeating digits.
3. Multiply both sides of the new equation by the power of 10 that has as
many zeros as there are repeating digits.
4. Subtract the equation in Step 2 from the equation in Step 3, and solve
for N.
Put these steps to use with the following example problem.
Find the fractional equivalent of the repeating decimal 0.123555555555 . . . .
You can solve this problem using the steps as previously given:
1. Set the decimal equal to N to get N = 0.123555555555 . . . .
2. Multiply both sides by 1,000 (because the 123 doesn’t repeat), which
gives you 1,000N = 123.555555555 . . . .
3. Multiply each side of the equation in Step 2 by 10 (because only
one digit, the 5, keeps repeating), and you get 10,000N = 
1235.555555555 . . . .

Understanding the Relationship between
Percents and Decimals
Percents are found daily in newspaper ads, financial statements, medical
reports, and so on. However, percentages aren’t really the same as the rest of
our numbers. You need to change from a percent to a decimal before doing
any computations involving percents of other quantities.
A percent is a number that represents how many compared to 100. Percents
are usually much quicker and easier to understand or know the worth of than
their fractional counterparts. Sure, you have some easier equivalents, such
as 1⁄2 and 50% or 3⁄4 and 75%. But a fraction’s worth may not jump out at you. 
For instance, you may not immediately realize that 20
7 is 35%.
In the earlier section, “Changing from Fractions to Decimals,” I show you how
to get from a fraction to its decimal equivalent. In this section, you see how
to change from decimals to percents and from percents to decimals.
Percents are easy to understand, because you can quickly compare the per-
cent amount to 100. If you’re told that 89% of the people have arrived at an
event, you know that most of the people have come. After all, 89 out of 100 is
a lot of those expected. Similarly, if you’re told that the chance of rain is 1%,
you know that the chances are slim-to-none that you’ll have precipitation,
because 1 out of 100 isn’t a large amount.
Decimals are fairly easy to deal with, but you may have more trouble wrap-
ping your head around how much 0.125 of an estate is. Did you realize that
0.125 is the same as 12.5%? If so, you’re probably in the minority. But good for
you for knowing!
24
Part I: Reviewing Basic Math for Business and Real Estate Transactions 

Transforming from percents to decimals
A percentage is recognizable by the % symbol, or just by the word, percent.
Percents are sort of pictures of amounts, and so they need to be changed to a
decimal or fractional equivalent before combining them with other numbers.
If I told you that 89% of the people had arrived at a meeting, and you’re
expecting 500 people, you can’t just multiply 89 by 500 to get the number of
people who have arrived. Why? Well, 89 × 500 = 44,500. So you can see that
the answer doesn’t make any sense. Instead, you need to change percents to
decimals before trying to do computations.
To change a percent to its decimal equivalent, move the decimal point in the
percent two places to the left. Moving the decimal point two places to the left
gives you the same result as multiplying the percent amount by 0.01 (one
hundredth). Why are you multiplying by 0.01? Because percents are compar-
isons to 100; you’re changing the percent to how many out of 100.
The decimal equivalent of 12.5% is 0.125, and the decimal equivalent of 6% is
0.06. Notice that with 6%, I had to add a 0 in front of the 6 to be able to move
the decimal point the two decimal places. You assume that there’s a decimal
point to the right of the 6 in 6%.
If you’re told that 89% of the people have arrived at the company-wide meet-
ing, and you’re expecting 500 people, how many people have arrived?
To find out, simply change 89% to its decimal equivalent, 0.89. Then multiply
0.89 × 500 = 445 people.
When checking on the latest shipment of eggs, your dairy manager tells you
that 1⁄2% of them are cracked. The shipment contained 3,000 dozen eggs. How
many were cracked?
First, change 3,000 dozen to an actual number of eggs by multiplying 3,000 ×
12 = 36,000 eggs. Next, change 1⁄2% to a decimal. The fraction 1⁄2 is 0.5 as a deci-
mal, so 1⁄2% is 0.5%. Now, to change 0.5% to a decimal, move the decimal point
two places to the left to get 0.005. Multiply 36,000 by 0.005, and you discover
that 180 eggs are cracked. That’s 15 dozen eggs in all.
Moving from decimals to percents
When you change a number from a decimal to a percent, it’s probably
because you have a task in mind. Most likely, you’ve started with a fraction
and are using the decimal as the transition number — the number between
fractions and percents. If the decimal terminates, you can just carry all the
digits along in the percent, or you can round off to a predetermined number
25
Chapter 2: Fractions, Decimals, and Percents

of digits. If the decimal repeats, you want to decide how many decimal points
you want in the percent value.
To change a decimal to its percent equivalent, move the decimal point in the
decimal two places to the right.
If 13 out of 20 people received a flu shot, what percentage of people have
received the shot?
To find the percentage, first write 13 out of 20 as a fraction. Then you can
divide 13 by 20 to get the decimal equivalent: 0.65. (You can see how to
change fractions to decimals in the earlier section “Changing from Fractions
to Decimals.”) Now change 0.65 to a percent by moving the decimal point two
places to the right, which gives you 65%. (I don’t show the decimal point to
the right of the 5 in 65%, because it’s understood to be there when it’s not
otherwise shown.)
The evening crew has completed 67 out of the 333 packets that need to be
filled for the big order. What percentage of the packets has been completed?
The decimal equivalent of the fraction 333
67 is 0.201201 . . . . As you can see, 
this is a repeating decimal. Moving the decimal point two places to the right
gives you 20.1201201 . . . . Now you need to decide how many decimal places
to keep.
Let’s say that you want just the nearer percent. In that case, you round off all
the digits to the right of the decimal point. The number 1,201,201 is less than
half of 5,000,000, so you can just drop all the digits to the right of the decimal
point and call the percentage 20%. (See “Rounding decimals up or down,” ear-
lier in this chapter, for more on how to round numbers and drop digits.)
Dealing with more than 100%
Sometimes you may find it difficult to get your head around the report that
there’s a 300% increase in the number of travelers in a company or that
you’re getting a 104% increase in your salary. Just what do the percents really
mean, and how do you work with them in computations?
First, think about 100% of something. For instance, if you’re told that 100% of a
job is complete, you know that the whole thing is wrapped up. But it doesn’t
make sense that 200% of the job is complete — you can’t do more than all of
the job. So, instead, think of 100% in terms of money. If I pay you 100% of what
I owe you, say $800, I pay you all the money — $800. But if I pay you 200% of
what I owe you, I pay you all of it twice — or $1,600. (Now, why would I do
that? Because I really like you!)
26
Part I: Reviewing Basic Math for Business and Real Estate Transactions 

For percents that exceed 100%, apply the same rule for changing percents to
decimals. The equivalent of 200% is 2.00, and the equivalent of 104% is 1.04.
Try this example to better understand how to work with percentages that are
equal to more than 100. Suppose you’re promised a 104% increase in salary if
you agree to stay in your position for another 5 years. If you’re currently
earning $87,000, what will your salary be for the next 5 years?
To start, multiply 1.04 by $87,000 to get $90,480. Now the question is: Does
the $90,480 actually represent an increase — an amount to be added to your
current salary? If so, you’ll be earning $87,000 + $90,480 = $177,480. Or did the
person offering the increase actually mean to just increase your salary by 4%,
in which case you’d be earning the $90,480? You need to be sure you under-
stand the terms exactly. In Chapter 3, you can see how to be sure of your fig-
ures when talking about percentages and their ups and downs.
Coming to Grips with Fractions
I’ll bet that fractions are your favorite things. Everyone I know just loves frac-
tions. Oh, who am I kidding? I didn’t have you fooled for a minute. So frac-
tions are way down on your list of things to talk about at a party, but they
can’t be ignored. Fractions are a way of life. You cut a pie into eighths, sixths,
or fourths (or, heaven forbid, sevenths). You whip out your 7⁄8-inch wrench.
You measure a board to be 5 feet and 9⁄16 inches long.
See what happened when the United States decided not to go metric? We got
stuck using all these fractions when computing. So, until that happy day
when the country changes its mind regarding the metric system, you can deal
with fractions and the operations that go with them.
Fractions are still useful for describing amounts. They’re exact numbers, so a
sale proclaiming 1⁄3 off the original price tells you to divide by 3 and take one
of them away from the original price. Do you get the same thing changing the
fraction to a decimal? No, not really. The decimal for 1⁄3 is 0.3333 . . ., which
approximates 1⁄3 but isn’t exactly the same. You don’t really notice the differ-
ence unless you’re dealing with large amounts of money or assets.
Adding and subtracting fractions
Fractions can be added and subtracted only if they have the same denomina-
tor. So before adding or subtracting them, you have to find equivalent values
for the fractions involved so that they have the same denominator. One frac-
tion is equivalent to another if the numerator and denominator of the one
27
Chapter 2: Fractions, Decimals, and Percents

fraction are the same multiple as the numerator and denominator of the
other fraction. For example, the following three fractions are equivalent to

You could find infinite numbers of fractions that are equivalent to the given
fraction. The three I chose are found by multiplying the numerator and
denominator by 5, 8, and 1⁄6.
As I note earlier, you can only add or subtract fractions if they have the same
denominator. So if two fractions that need to be added together don’t have
the same denominator, you have to change the fractions until they do. You
change either one or both of the fractions until they have the same (common)
denominator. For example, if you want to add 3⁄5 and 7⁄10, you change the 3⁄5 to
an equivalent fractions with 10 in the denominator. The fraction equivalent to
3⁄5 is 6⁄10, which has the same (common) denominator as the fraction 7⁄10.
Find the sum of 3⁄4 and 3⁄8.
Change 3⁄4 to a fraction with 8 in the denominator. Then add the two numera-
tors together. Your math should look like this:

The sum of the two fractions, 9⁄8, is an improper fraction — it’s bigger than 1.
So, you need to rewrite it as 11⁄8.
To write an improper fraction as a mixed number, you divide the denomina-
tor into the numerator. The number of times that the denominator divides is
the whole number, in front. The remainder goes in the numerator of the frac-
tion that’s left. If you need to borrow from the whole number in order to sub-
tract, you add the equivalent of 1 to the fraction.
Find the difference between 91⁄3 and 47⁄8.

that’s added.
Multiplying and dividing fractions
Adding and subtracting fractions is generally more complicated than multi-
plying and dividing them. The nice thing about multiplication and division of
fractions is that you don’t need a common denominator. And you can reduce
the fractions before ever multiplying to make the numbers smaller and more
manageable. The challenge, however, is that you have to change all mixed
numbers to improper fractions and change whole numbers to fractions by
putting them in the numerator with a 1 in the denominator.
Multiply 51⁄3 by 41⁄5.
To find the product of this problem, first change the mixed numbers to
improper fractions. To do so, multiply the whole number by the denominator,
add the numerator, and then write the sum over the denominator, like this:

The final answer, 222⁄5, is obtained by dividing the numerator by the denomi-
nator and writing the quotient and remainder as a mixed fraction.
To divide one fraction by another, you change the problem to multiplication
by flipping the second fraction. In other words, division is actually multiplica-
tion by the reciprocal of a number. The reciprocal of 2, for example, is 1⁄2, and
the reciprocal of 4⁄7 is 7⁄4.
Divide 83⁄4 by 31⁄8.

nformation involving percentages is fairly easy to decipher. If you’re 45 per-
cent finished with a project, for instance, you know that you’re almost half
done. Percents are based on the idea how many out of 100, so the comparison
of the percentage to the total amount is quick and universally understood.
You’re probably confronted with percent increases and decreases on a daily
basis. For example, you may deal with salary increases or decreases. Citing
these changes as percentages is easier when it comes to comparing the
changes. One person’s increase of $2,000 per year, for instance, is much dif-
ferent from another person’s increase of the same amount — especially when
one person currently earns $10,000 and the other earns $100,000.
In this chapter, you find methods for determining the percent increase or
decrease so that you can do comparisons. You also find out how to work back-
ward from an increased amount to see what the original figure was. If you’re a
little shaky on percents and doing computations with them, flip to Chapter 2.
There you can get reacquainted with the ins and outs of percentages.
Working with Percent Increase
A percent increase isn’t just an increase in the original amount; it’s a compari-
son to the original amount. When you get a 5% increase in salary, you get
what you originally earned plus an additional 5% of that original amount. If
you’re told the dollar amount of your increase and want to determine what
percent that increase is, you compare the amount of the increase by the origi-
nal amount. The original amount, the new amount, the increase, and the 

percent increase are all entwined with one another and allow you to solve for
any one of the values when given the others. I explain how in the following
sections.
Computing new totals with increases
You can add or subtract percents to get their sums or differences; the
answers in these cases are in percents. But when mixing percents with
numerical amounts, such as money or time, you have to change the percent
to a decimal before multiplying. (I discuss the percent-to-decimal procedure
in detail in Chapter 2.)
When figuring the amount resulting from a particular percent increase, you
change the percent to a decimal and then multiply by the original amount.
After you have the amount of the increase, you add that amount to the origi-
nal number to get the new total. Or, if you want one-stop computing, you can
add the percentage value of the increase to 100%. Then you change the total
percentage to a decimal, multiply by the original amount, and have the new
total amount as a final result.
When you have amount A and want to determine a percent increase of p%,
you find the
 Percent increase by multiplying A × 0.01p.
 New total by adding 100% + p% and then multiplying A × 0.01(100 + p).
Tip: Multiplying the percent by 0.01 is the same as moving the decimal point
two places to the left.
Find the percent increase and new salary if your employer is going to give
you a 5% increase on your current salary of $48,200.
To find the percent increase, multiply 0.05 by $48,200 to get $2,410. The new
salary is the sum of the increase and the original salary: $2,410 + $48,200 =
$50,610. You also can get the new total by multiplying the original salary by
105% (add the 5% increase to 100%): $48,200 × 1.05 = $50,610.
Determining the percent increase
When given the percentage that some number is to be increased, you change
the percentage to a decimal and multiply by the original amount. So, for
example, a 3% increase on 200 items is 0.03 × 200 = 6. As you can see, it takes
multiplication to find the percent increase, so it takes division to find out the
percent if you only know the increase.
32
Part I: Reviewing Basic Math for Business and Real Estate Transactions 

To find the percentage amount that something has increased, you divide the
amount of the increase by the original value. The formula you use looks like
this:
percent increase
original amount
amount of increase
original amount
increased amount
original amount
=
=
-
Try out the following example to see how this formula works.
Suppose that your best salesman sold 400 cars last year and 437 cars this
year. What was the percent increase of his sales?
To find the percent increase, first subtract 400 from 437 to get an increase of
37 cars this year. Now divide 37 by the original amount (last year’s number)
to get the decimal value that you can then change to a percent. Here’s what
the math looks like:
percent increase
400
437
400
400

0.0925

-
=
=
As you can see, the decimal answer is 0.0925, which is equal to 9.25%. (Refer
to Chapter 2 if you need a reminder on how to change from a decimal to a
percent.)
Solving for the original amount
With the basic equation used to solve for the percent increase (refer to the pre-
vious section), you can solve for either the percent increase, the increased
amount, or the original amount — as long as you’re given the other two values.
I could give you three different formulas or equations, one to solve for each of
the values, but it’s easier to just remember one formula and perform some
simple algebra to solve for what’s missing.
Imagine you’re told that all the prices in a store increased by 41⁄2% last year.
You have a list of all the current prices and want to determine the original
price of an item. To do so, you just have to use the formula for percent
increase (provided in the previous section). You fill in the percentage and the
new price, let the original price be represented by x, and then solve for x.
Check out the following example for practice.
Say that a hardware store is selling a power washer for $208.95. This current
price is 41⁄2% higher than the price for the same power washer last year. What
was the cost of the washer last year?

Looking into Percent Decrease
Computing percent decrease has a lot of similarities to computing percent
increase — you change percents to decimals, you multiply by the original
amount, and then you refer to the original amount. However, sometimes the
math is just a bit trickier, because you subtract rather than add (subtraction
is a more difficult operation for most folks). And the amount of the decrease
often gets obscured (you end up computing with a number that wasn’t in the
original problem) when you find the reduced amount directly, without sub-
tracting. I explain everything you need to know about computing percent
decreases in the following sections.
For many of you, the best method for determining whether you’ve made an
error in computation is just common sense. You don’t have to be a mathe-
matician to have a feel for the answer. If you’re figuring the percent increase
in your salary and you get a 400% increase, you’ll probably realize that this
isn’t realistic. (If it is realistic, then we need to talk.) Basically, you see if the
answer resembles what you’ve expected; most of the errors come from using
the wrong operation, not in the actual arithmetic (because most people use a
calculator, anyway).

Finding new totals with decreases
Percent decreases play a huge role in the world of discount pricing. You see
advertisements by merchants announcing that certain items, or even all
items, are marked down by a particular percent of the original value of the
item. The percent decrease is determined by multiplying the decimal equiva-
lent of the percent decrease by the original amount.
When you have amount A and want to determine a percent decrease of p%,
you find the
 Percent decrease by multiplying A × 0.01p.
 New total by subtracting 100% – p% and multiplying A × 0.01(100 – p).
Multiplying by 0.01 has the same effect as moving the decimal point two places
to the left. (You can see more on changing percents to decimals in Chapter 2.)
Tip: For the store that has to determine all the new prices of all the red-
tagged items, a nice spreadsheet does the job quickly and accurately. In
Chapter 5, you see some suggestions for using a computer spreadsheet.
This example should get you going in the right direction with percent
decreases: Say that the after-the-holidays sale at a furniture store features
40% off all red-tagged items. What’s the new price of a $3,515 sofa after the
40% decrease in price?
The amount of the decrease is 40%, which is 0.40 as a decimal. First multiply
the original amount by the percentage in decimal form: $3,515 × 0.40 = $1,406.
Then subtract that product from the original amount to get the new price:
$3,515 – $1,406 = $2,109.
Figuring out the percent decrease
Say you purchase several thousand dollars’ worth of office supplies and are
given a volume discount on the entire order. Your bill just shows the total
before the discount and the net cost after the discount. You can determine
the percentage of the discount by using the formula for percent decrease.
To find the percent decrease, you divide the amount of the decrease by the
original value. Here’s the formula:
percent decrease
original amount
amount of decrease
original amount
original amount
reduced amount
=

-
Using this formula, try out the following example problem.
35
Chapter 3: Determining Percent Increase and Decrease

What’s the percent discount if you paid $1,418.55 for an order whose original
cost (before the discount) was $1,470?
To solve, simply plug all the numbers into the formula for percent decrease,
like so:

The decimal 0.035 is equivalent to 3.5%.
Restoring the original price 
from a decreased price
If you purchase a piece of machinery after getting the frequent customer dis-
count of 10%, you may want to determine the original cost for insurance pur-
poses. To find out that original cost, you use the formula for determining the
percent decrease. You let the original amount be represented by x, and then
you solve for x in the equation after replacing the other quantities with their
respective values.
For example, suppose you’re such a good customer at Tracy’s Tractors that
you’re given a 10% discount on your purchase of a new tractor. You have to
pay only $7,688.70. You need to insure the tractor at its replacement cost.
What did the tractor cost before the discount?
Using the percent discount formula, replace the percent with 10% and the dis-
counted price with $7,688.70. Let the original price be represented by x and
solve for x. Here’s what the new equation will look like:

 Working with proportions
 Writing and solving linear equations from algebra
 Considering direct and indirect variation
O
ne of the most useful structures in mathematics is the proportion. You
use it to parcel out amounts in fair and equal portions and to determine
equivalent lengths, volumes, or amounts of money. A proportion is nothing
more than two fractions set equal to one another, but it’s beautifully symmet-
ric and functionally versatile.
Working with proportions helps you solve simple algebraic equations. An alge-
braic equation has at least one unknown variable lurking in its depths. You’ve
solved an algebraic equation when you figure out what a missing variable is
worth. The rules for solving simple, linear algebraic equations make a lot of
sense and are easy to remember. The key is to keep the equation balanced.
I also cover direct and indirect variation in this chapter. Both of these are
actually comparisons of things. Two items vary directly with one another 
if one of the items is tied to the other by some multiple. For example, if 
Henry always runs twice as fast as Henrietta, then when Henrietta runs at 
3 meters per second, you know that Henry runs at 6 meters per second.
Indirect variation takes a bit more explanation, but it’s basically an opposite
type of relationship — as one thing gets bigger, the other gets smaller.
You won’t get as much exposure to solving equations in this chapter as you
would if you were reading Algebra For Dummies or Algebra II For Dummies
(both from Wiley), but do know that I show you the basics and all you need
to handle equations special to business math.

Setting Up Proportions
A proportion is an equation in which one fraction is set equal to another frac-
tion. The following are examples of proportions:

Equating hourly rates with hours
When setting up a proportion, you keep the same units either across from
one another or in the same fraction — above and below one another. Try
your hand at proportions with the following example.
Set up a proportion involving the fact that 1 pound equals 16 ounces and 80
ounces equals 5 pounds.
To set up this proportion, you either have to write the pounds across from
one another or above and below one another. Also, you have to keep the
equivalences across from one another or above and below one another. The
following are just four of the different ways that the proportion involving
pounds and ounces can be written correctly:
16 ounces
1 pound
80 ounces
5 pounds

=
A property common to all proportions is that the cross products (the diagonal
products) are always equal. This commonality makes checking and solving
proportions even easier. When you multiply the top left number by the
bottom right number, you get the same result as multiplying the bottom left
number by the top right number.
For example, in the equation involving fractions equaling 1⁄2 (shown at the
beginning of this section), you see that the cross products are both 150. The
cross products in the proportion involving miles and feet have cross prod-
ucts of 1,320. You can check the other proportions so far and see that the
cross products always come out the same.
Proportions have several properties that make them easy to deal with and 
solve. Given the proportion b

first, and divide the two bottom numbers by 10. Then divide the numbers in
the left fraction by 2. Here’s what your reductions should look like so far:

really, except that proportions always act that way and give you a true state-
ment. The real power and versatility of proportions come into play when you
solve for some unknown value within the proportion.
Solving Proportions for Missing Values
Proportions and their properties find their way into many financial and scien-
tific applications. For instance, determining doses of medicine incorporates
proportions involving a person’s weight. Vegetation and animal habitats are
in a balance expressed with proportions as well. And figuring a seller’s share
of the real estate taxes involves ratios and proportions.
39
Chapter 4: Dealing with Proportions and Basic Algebra

Setting up and solving
The biggest challenge when solving a proportion for an unknown value is in
setting the proportion up correctly. (I detail the correct way to set up a propor-
tion in the earlier section, “Setting Up Proportions.”) When you have an
unknown value, you let that value be represented by a variable, usually x, you
cross-multiply, and then you solve the resulting equation for that variable. The
following example gives you a chance to solve a proportion for a missing value.
A distributor of garbage disposals has been getting complaints that pieces
are missing from the boxes of new disposals. In the past month, the distribu-
tor has sold 143 disposals and has received 15 complaints. He has 200 more
of the disposals in his warehouse. If the complaint pattern holds, how many
of the remaining disposals can he expect to have missing parts?
To find out, set up one fraction with the 143 disposals in the numerator (the
top part of the fraction) and the 15 complaints in the denominator (the bottom
part). The other fraction in the proportion needs to have the 200 disposals in
the numerator — opposite the 143 disposals — and an x in the denominator,
representing the unknown number of complaints. Here’s what the proportion
looks like:
x
15 complaints
143 disposals
complaints
200 disposals
=
Solve for x by cross-multiplying and then dividing each side of the equation
by the coefficient of x. Take a look at the math:

So, the distributor can expect to have about 21 more complaints — unless he
decides to open the boxes beforehand to check whether the parts are all there.
Interpolating when necessary
In Chapter 15, you find many charts and tables with rows and columns full of
numbers. When reading tables and using the numbers in computations or
reports, it’s sometimes necessary to read between the lines, or, mathemati-
cally speaking, to interpolate.
Interpolation is basically inserting numbers between entries in a table. You
assume that the change from one entry to another is pretty uniform and that
you can find a number halfway between two numbers on the table by halving
the difference. Proportions allow you to find numbers between the entries
that are more or less than halfway between.

Part I: Reviewing Basic Math for Business and Real Estate Transactions 

Table 4-1 shows the cumulative sales of a realty company for the first few
months of the year. (The word cumulative means that it’s the sum of every-
thing up to that point.) On March 1, the total number of homes sold by the
realty company was 50. On April 1, the total number of homes sold was 100. If
you assume that the sales were relatively steady throughout the month of
March, how many homes had been sold by March 20?
Table 4-1

To interpolate, set up a proportion in which one fraction has the number of
days involved and the other fraction has the number of homes. Now you
need to do the following three things to solve the entire problem:
1. Determine how many homes were sold from March 1 through April 1.
2. Solve for the number of homes sold by March 20.
3. Add the result from Step 2 to the 50 homes that were sold by March 1.
First, 50 – 20 = 30 tells you that 30 homes were sold in March. Let the fraction
involving the days have 20 in the numerator and 31 in the denominator.
(“Thirty days hath September . . .”) Put the x opposite the 20 and the 30
opposite the 31. So your proportion looks like this:
x
31 days
20 days
30 homes
homes
=
Now cross-multiply and divide each side of the equation by the coefficient 
of x:

It looks like about 19 homes were sold between March 1 and March 20, so the
year-to-date number on March 20 is 20 + 19 = 39 homes. Great work!
41
Chapter 4: Dealing with Proportions and Basic Algebra

When using proportions to interpolate, be careful not to assume a relatively
equal rate between the consecutive entries in the table. In the practice prob-
lem, if I would have tried to interpolate starting from the beginning of the year,
I would have received a completely different (and incorrect) number. Only 20
homes were sold during the first two months and then 30 more during the
third month. The average change is different for the different months.
Handling Basic Linear Equations
When solving proportions for an unknown value, and when performing many
mathematical computations involving measures, money, or time, you’ll likely
find yourself working with an equation that has a variable in it. You solve for
the value of the unknown by applying basic algebraic processes. These
processes keep the integrity of the equation while they change its format so
you can find the value of the unknown.
When solving a basic linear equation of the form ax + b = c, where x is an
unknown variable and a, b, and c are constants, you apply the following rules
(not all will be used in every equation — you pick and choose per situation):
 Add the same number to each side of the equation.
 Subtract the same number from each side of the equation.
 Multiply both sides of the equation by the same number (but don’t mul-
tiply by 0).
 Divide each side of the equation by the same number (but don’t divide
by 0).
 Distribute (multiply) each term in parentheses by the number outside
the parentheses so that you can drop the parentheses.
 Check your answer in the original equation to be sure it makes sense.
Here’s an example you can try: Solve this equation for the value of 
x: 3(2x – 7) = 4x – 13.
First distribute the 3 over the terms in the parentheses by multiplying each
term by 3. You get 6x – 21 = 4x – 13.
Now subtract 4x from each side and add 21 to each side. Doing so allows you
to get the x’s on one side of the equation and the numbers without x’s on the
other side. Here’s how your math should look:

Now divide each side of the equation by 2, and you get that x = 4. Always
check your answer. If you replace the x with 4, you get 3(2×4 – 7) = 4×4 – 13.
In the parentheses, you get 8 – 7 = 1. So the equation now reads 3(1) = 16 – 13,
or 3 = 3. When you see a true statement — one in which a number equals
itself — you know that you’ve done the process correctly.

You can stop with the check at this stage, noting that both fractions are equal
to 1⁄2. Or you can cross-multiply to get 8,000 on each side of the equation. You
also can reduce both fractions to get the same numbers. In any case, you’ve
shown that the 10 does represent the x in the proportion.
Comparing Values with Variation
What is variation? It’s how one entity varies with relation to another. Variation
comes in two varieties: direct and indirect. Consider the following statements:
 The pressure of a gas is indirectly proportional to its volume.
 The productivity of the team is indirectly proportional to the number of
absences.
 The revenue earned is directly proportional to the hours worked.
 The speed of the truck is directly proportional to the acceleration.
I explain the differences between the two types of variation in the following
sections.
Getting right to it with direct variation
When one quantity varies directly with another, one quantity is directly pro-
portional to the other. An algebraic expression of how the two quantities a
and b vary directly is: a = kb, where k is the constant of proportionality, which
is the multiplier that connects the two quantities. If you divide each side of
the equation by b, you get the following proportion:
b
a
k
1
=
And this shows you how the proportion and variation are tied together. When
quantities vary directly, one quantity is a multiple of the other. If you know at
least one of the quantities in the relationship, you can solve for the other (if
it’s unknown). Check out the following example problem to see exactly what 
I mean.
The revenue earned by the sales office varies directly with the number of
hours spent out in the field. Last month, the sales team earned $450,000 and
spent a total of 1,200 hours meeting with customers. How much will the team
earn if it spends 2,000 hours out in the field?
44
Part I: Reviewing Basic Math for Business and Real Estate Transactions 

Using direct variation, you need to find the value of k, the constant of propor-
tionality. Write the equation $450,000 = k × 1,200 for the relationship between
the quantities. Divide each side of the equation by 1,200, and you get that 
k = 375. Now, to solve for the amount earned if the team is in the field for 2,000
hours, plug the numbers into the formula and solve: 375 × 2,000 = $750,000.
What does the k, the constant of proportionality, really represent in this
problem? You can interpret k to be the number of dollars earned per hour
spent with a customer — a sort of average for the business.
Going the indirect route 
with indirect variation
Two quantities vary inversely, or indirectly, if, as one quantity increases, the
other decreases proportionately. Instead of a constant multiplier of k, like you
find with direct variation, the equation tying the two quantities together is:
a
b
k
=
Try your hand at the following indirect variation example.
When a 2 x 4 pine board is suspended between two buildings (with just the
ends of the board at the building edges), the maximum weight that the board
can support varies indirectly with the distance between the buildings. If the
distance between the buildings is 10 feet, the board can support 480 pounds.
What’s the maximum amount of weight that such a board can support if the
buildings are 20 feet apart? How about 30 feet apart?
First write the relationship between the 10-foot distance and the 480 pounds
so you can solve for k by multiplying each side of the equation by 10:
,
k
k
480

4 800
=
=
Next, solve for the amount of weight that can be supported, putting 4,800 for
the value of k and the distance of 20 feet in the denominator:
,
20
4 800
240
=
The board can support half as much at that distance — or 120 fewer pounds
when the distance is increased by 10 feet.

Now, using the equation and replacing the denominator with 30, you get:
,

Increase the distance by another 10 feet, and the amount of weight decreases
by another 80 pounds.

hether you want them to be or not, formulas are a part of your life.
For instance, when you pay your income tax, the amount you owe is
determined with a formula. Yes, I know that you may use a table of values,
but where do you think those values came from? Why, a formula, of course!
When the meteorologist on television talks about the heat index or wind chill
factor, the numbers come from a formula. And when you order new carpeting
for your office, you take measurements and determine the amount needed
using a formula.
You use lots and lots of formulas at work and at home. Like many folks, you
may not have realized how much formulas are a part of your life. So, as you
can see, formulas are our friends. They offer organization and structure in a
chaotic world. A formula qualifies as such when it consistently gives you cor-
rect results and answers to questions.
In this chapter, you see how to use formulas properly when you have more
than one choice of operation involved. You also see how to simplify the com-
plex parts of a formula. I even show you some of the ins and outs of using 
calculators to help you solve mathematical expressions. Finally, I show you
the beauty of entering a formula into a computer spreadsheet, such as
Microsoft Excel, and seeing hundreds of computations magically appear
before your very eyes.

Familiarizing Yourself with a Formula
Formulas are usually long-established relationships that you use in your cal-
culator or computer spreadsheet (or, heaven forbid, with a pencil and some
paper). You find formulas in textbooks, almanacs, mathematical tables, and,
best of all, on the Internet.
Having a formula such as I = Prt or S = 1⁄2n(n + 1) is fine and dandy as long as
you know what to do with it. Otherwise, it may as well be Greek. So the first
course of action to use when confronted with a formula is to identify all the
players. What do the I, P, r, t, S, and n stand for in the formulas? Lots of times
the letters used in a formula have the same beginning letter as what the let-
ters represent — but not always. After you’ve conquered the identification
hurdle, you need to find numbers to replace the letters within the formula.
Next, you check to see that the numbers you’re using are in the same units —
you can’t mix feet and inches, pounds and tons, or apples and oranges. Finally,
you get to the fun part: performing the mathematical operations. I explain
each of these steps in the following sections.
Identifying variables and 
replacing them correctly
A formula is essentially an equation in which some relationship between the
values in the equation is always true. For example, the area of a rectangle is
always equal to the product of the rectangle’s length multiplied by the rec-
tangle’s width. So the formula for the area of a rectangle is written A = lw.
(I introduce this formula in Chapter 21.)
When using a formula, you first need to know what each letter represents, and
then you need to replace the corresponding letters with the correct values
from the problem. Consider, for example, the formula I = Prt. This is the simple
interest formula. (You find more info on interest in Chapter 9.) The letter I rep-
resents the amount of interest earned when the principal, P, is deposited at
the rate of interest, r, for a certain number of years, t. Here’s another way to
view this formula:
Interest = Principal × Rate × Time
In the simple interest formula, you have three values being multiplied by
one another on the right side of the equation. So if you’re told that $5,000
is invested for 6 years at 4% interest, you have to know that the $5,000
replaces the P; the decimal equivalent of 4%, 0.04, replaces the r; and 6 years
replaces the t.
50
Part II: Taking Intriguing Math to Work 

After the letters are replaced by numbers, you have to resort to another nota-
tion to show the original multiplication. If you just fill in the numbers with no
grouping symbols, you get I = 5,0000.046, which hardly makes sense. Instead,
you use parentheses to separate the values: I = 5,000(0.04)(6).
Now, as another example, consider the formula for computing compound
interest:
A
P
nr
1
n t
=
+
c
m
The letters in this formula are
A for the total amount of money accumulated
P for the principal or initial money deposited
r for the interest rate as a decimal
n for the number of times each year the interest is compounded
t for the number of years involved
Note that the letters in the formula pretty much represent the first letter of
each word involved. It isn’t always possible to match each value with its corre-
sponding letter, but, when possible, it’s most helpful to have the coordination.
In the compound interest formula, if you’re told to find the interest rate that
results in an accumulation of $150,000 when $100,000 is deposited for 5 years
and the interest is compounded quarterly, you need to know how to replace
the variables with the appropriate numbers. In this example, the $150,000
replaces the A, the $100,000 replaces the P, the letter n is replaced with a 4,
and t is replaced with 5. When you replace the letters in the compound inter-
est formula, you get the following equation:
,
,
r
150 000
100 000 1
4
( )
4 5
=
+

m
In real-life situations, the substitutions aren’t going to be given to you as 
A = 150,000, r = 4.5%, and so on. Instead, you have to read, interpret, substi-
tute, simplify, and then solve.
Adjusting for differing units
Formulas dealing with perimeter or area need input values in inches, feet,
yards, or some other linear measure. Formulas dealing with interest need
input values involving money, percentages, and time. But you can’t just enter
51
Chapter 5: Working with Formulas

values willy-nilly without considering the units involved. Just because the t
stands for time doesn’t mean that you get to put in days or months. You only
get to replace with those units if the interest is coordinated with that time
measure.
The same goes for area and perimeter formulas. For example, say that you’re
asked to find the area of a rectangle. If you’re given the length in feet and the
width in inches, you need to change one or the other so that the measures
use the same units.
In general, to change units, you start with the known equivalence between
two different units, and then perform multiplication or division to create the
numbers that you need. The following examples provide you some practice
with changing from one unit to another.
Find the area of a factory floor space that’s 40 feet, 8 inches wide by 26 yards,
2 feet, and 9 inches long.
The measurements given here are a conglomeration of units, so you need to
change all of them to the same unit. However, if you change everything to
inches, the numbers will get awfully big. Changing to yards, on the other
hand, involves fractions of yards as well as fractions of feet (which I guaran-
tee won’t be fun). So a good compromise is to change everything to feet
before computing the area.
Here are some tips to help with this problem: The area of a rectangle is
found by multiplying its length by its width. (Refer to Chapter 21 for lots
more information on area, perimeter, and measures.) Also, keep in mind
these equivalents:
1 yard = 3 feet
1 foot = 12 inches
So to change the width of 40 feet, 8 inches to a measure in feet only, you have
to divide the 8 inches by 12. This calculation gives you 2⁄3 foot. So the width is
402⁄3 feet.
To change 26 yards, 2 feet, 9 inches to feet, first multiply 26 × 3 = 78 feet. Then
divide the 9 inches by 12 to get 3⁄4 foot. The length is 78 feet + 2 feet + 3⁄4 foot =
803⁄4 feet.
Now, to find the area of this rectangle, you just have to multiply the length by
the width, like this:

Part II: Taking Intriguing Math to Work 

So the area is 3,2835⁄6 feet, or 3,283 feet, 10 inches. You change the 5⁄6 feet to
inches by multiplying 5⁄6 by 12.
Here’s another example to help you practice unit conversion: What’s the inter-
est on a loan of $21,000 at 9% annual interest if you’re borrowing it for 90 days?
Interest is found with the formula I = Prt, where P is the principal or amount
borrowed, r is the annual rate of interest (written as a decimal), and t is the
number of years you’re borrowing the money.
To use the interest formula, you need to change the 90 days into a part of a
year. The simplest method is to use ordinary interest (where you use 360
for the number of days in a year) so that when you divide 90 by 360 you get
1⁄4 year. (In Chapter 9, you can find an explanation of the difference between
ordinary and exact interest.) The annual rate of interest percentage, written
as a decimal, is 0.09. And the fraction that will fill in for time, 1⁄4, is equal to
0.25 in decimal form. So, in this problem, I = $21,000(0.09)(0.25) = $472.50.
You pay almost $500 for the privilege of borrowing the money for 90 days.
Recognizing operations
A mathematical operation tells you to do something to a number or a set of
numbers. The four basic operations are: +, –, ×, and ÷. These four basic opera-
tions are called binary operations, because they’re performed using two 
numbers. For example, you add 3 + 5. You can’t add 4 + . A second number is
needed to complete the task. “Aren’t all operations binary?” you ask. No. And
thank goodness they aren’t. Too many other tasks need to be performed —
and many of them on one number at a time. Some of the nonbinary operations 
are 
for finding a square root, ! for finding a factorial, and 8:
BD indicating to
round back to the greatest integer.
While adding and subtracting are indicated only by the + and – signs, this
isn’t the case for multiplying and dividing. You can denote multiplication and
division several different ways. Read on for details.
Multiple ways of showing multiplication
Formulas containing the multiplication operation seldom have the multiplica-
tion sign, ×, written in them. Because formulas have letters representing
numerical values, a multiplication sign often gets confused with the letter x.
The letter x is the most frequently used letter in algebra equations, too, so a
multiplication sign isn’t used there, either. Instead of the traditional multipli-
cation sign, multiplication in these cases is indicated with a dot, a grouping
symbol, or with nothing at all.
53
Chapter 5: Working with Formulas

For example, four ways of writing a times b are: ab, a·b, a(b), and a[b]. The
simple interest formula I = Prt shows three values multiplied together on the
right. And the formula for the sum of integers, S = 1⁄2n(n + 1), has 1⁄2 multiply-
ing n, which then multiplies the results inside the parentheses.
Dividing and conquering
Division is another operation that’s seldom shown with its traditional divi-
sion sign, ÷, in a formula. The two most commonly used methods of showing
division in a formula are to use a slash (/) or to write the numbers involved in
the division as a fraction. So 1⁄2 means to divide 1 by 2. And in the formula for 
finding the sum of squares, S

h, you divide the product 
(result of multiplying the numbers in the numerator) by 6.
Simplifying and Solving a Formula
After you’ve determined which formula to use, what each letter in the for-
mula represents, and where to substitute the various numbers (see the previ-
ous section for details), you get to simplify the formula and compute for the
unknown value. In other words, you get to solve the problem.
Most times, you’ll be solving for the lone letter on one side of the equation.
But occasionally (when you’re so lucky!), you get to solve for a letter or quan-
tity that’s embedded in the operations of the formula. Now you can’t just go
in and start ripping a formula apart. The rules governing solving equations
ensure that you get the intended answer. Everyone uses the same rules,
so everyone gets the same answer (if, of course, they do their arithmetic 
correctly). I explain these rules in the following sections.
Operating according to 
the order of operations
Centuries ago, before algebra was done symbolically with letters, exponents,
and operations, the processes in math were written out in words and expla-
nations. While this method of using words may have made the directions
pretty clear, the method was long and cumbersome, and it wasted space.
Along came the algebraic symbols, and the mathematics became neat, tidy,
and concise. In addition to these shorthand symbols came some rules that
were established so that everyone knew what the symbols meant. This way
folks had a road map for following the processes indicated by the symbols.
54
Part II: Taking Intriguing Math to Work 

One important part of this list of rules is the order of operations. The order of
operations kicks in when you have more than one operation to perform in an
expression. Just as the name implies, the operations of +, –, ×, ÷, 
, and the
exponents (powers) have to line up in order to be performed.
When grouping symbols appear in an equation, perform the operations
within the grouping symbols first. Grouping symbols include ( ), [ ], { }, | |,
and fraction lines. The grouping symbols supersede any operations, because
their contents need to be simplified and changed into a single value. After the
groupings are dealt with, you proceed with the rest of the process.
The order of operations dictates that, if no grouping symbols interfere, you
perform operations in the following order, moving from left to right:
1. Take roots and raise to powers.
2. Multiply and divide.
3. Add and subtract.
Try your hand at the order of operations with the example problems in the
following sections.
Example 1
Simplify the following expression using the order of operations:
6
2
4 3
2
18 121
3
+
-
+
$
Because the expression has no grouping symbols, you know that you first
need to deal with the power and root. So raise 2 to the third power and find
the square root of 121. Be sure to put a dot or parenthesis to indicate multi-
plication between the fraction and the answer to the root of 121. After the
radical is dropped, you lose the grouping symbol that indicates multiplica-
tion. Here’s what your new expression looks like:
6
8
4 3
2
18
11
+
-
+
$
$
Now, moving left to right, multiply the 4 and 3, divide the 18 by 2, and then
take the result of the division and multiply it by 11. After all these calcula-
tions, you get the following:
6
8
12
9 11

$
Now, add the 6 and 8 to get 14. Subtract the 12 to get 2, and add the 2 to 99.
The final answer is 101.

Making sure what you have makes sense
When simplifying expressions involving lots of numbers and operations, it’s
easy to make a simple arithmetic error. You may have a mental meltdown, or
you may enter the numbers into the calculator incorrectly. For these and sev-
eral other reasons, it’s always a good idea to have an approximate answer in
mind — or, at least, a general range of possible answers.
For example, say you want to find the interest earned on a deposit of $10,000
for 10 years. If you come up with an answer of $100,000 in interest, hopefully
you’ll realize that the answer isn’t reasonable. After all, that’s more interest
than the initial deposit! Unheard of! (Or, if it’s correct, tell me what bank you’re
using because I’m going to sign up!)
Here’s another example: If you’re determining the monthly payments on a
$4 million house and come up with $500 per month, you should be a bit sus-
picious of your answer (and ever hopeful). Why? Well, if you think about it,
$500 per month is awfully low for such a large home — and it would take
almost 700 years to pay back just the principal at this rate.
True, you’ll come across some situations where you have no clue what the
answer should be. I’m faced with them all the time. You just work as carefully
as you can, and perhaps check with someone else, too. In the big picture of
mathematics, though, using common sense goes a long way toward accuracy.
Computing with Technology
Gone are the days of the abacus, the rolled-up sleeves, the green visor, and
the quill pen. Okay, I’ve really mixed up some computing centuries, but you
probably get my point. Technology is here to stay. And that technology can
make your life much easier. However, you also can get into trouble much
more quickly when using technology; in a complex spreadsheet, a simple
error in only one cell can create calculating havoc.
In this section, I don’t try to sell you any particular brand of calculator or any
particular spreadsheet product. I’m just going to whet your appetite — tease
you with some neat features that technology brings to your business math
table. The directions and suggestions are as general as possible. So it’s up to
you to check out your own personal calculator or computer spreadsheet to
find the specific directions and processes necessary.

Calculators: Holding the answer 
in the palm of your hand
No matter how much you love to crunch numbers in your head, you eventu-
ally come across calculations that are too big or too difficult. In that case,
you look to a calculator for help. You can work most of these computations
with a simple scientific calculator. A scientific calculator raises numbers to
powers and finds roots and the values of logarithms.
You can go fancy-schmantzy and invest in a graphing calculator (or even in one
that does calculus), but be aware that the more features you have in your cal-
culator, the more opportunities you have of going astray. Besides, if you don’t
need to do fancy calculations, why spend more money on a fancy calculator?
The main challenge of using a calculator is to direct the calculator to do what
you mean. The calculator computes with a certain set of rules — mostly based
on the order of operations (see the earlier section, “Operating according to
the order of operations,” for more). So you need to push the right button, use
enough parentheses, and interpret the resulting answer. That way your calcu-
lator computes the right information and you answer your question correctly.
The four basic operations each have their own button on a calculator. When
you hit the + or - button, you see the + or – right on the screen. When you 
hit # , most calculators show the multiplication as an asterisk (*). The '
button usually conjures a slash (/).
Wielding the power of exponents
Many financial and geometrical formulas involve exponents (powers) of the
values in the expression. Some examples of these types of formulas include
the following:
Area of a circle: A = πr2
Accumulated money from compound interest: A

You access the power (exponent) button on a scientific calculator in one of
several ways. If you want to square a value (raise it to the second power),
you hit the button that looks like this:
x
2
58
Part II: Taking Intriguing Math to Work 

The square, or second power, is usually the only power to get its own button
on a calculator. Too many other powers are used in computing, so the rest
are taken care of with a general power button, which looks like one of the 
following:
,
,
x
y
y
x
/
The two buttons with x raised to the y or y raised to the x are sort of scripted.
You have to enter the numbers exactly in the correct order for the calculator
to compute what you mean. To use this button, you put in the x value first,
you hit the button, and then finally you put in the y value.
I’m sure you’re dying to try out these new tricks on your calculator. As prac-
tice, determine how to enter the following expressions in a calculator:

Chapter 5: Working with Formulas
Taking advantage of hand-held 
and online calculators
Hand-held calculators have been around since
the 1960s. Some of the first calculators did little
more than add, subtract, multiply, and divide. You
had the choice between answers correct to two
decimal places or the expanded five decimal
places. Wow! We’ve come a long way, baby.
Nowadays, you have more choices than you can
ever fully investigate. For under $10, you can do
exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric com-
putations to an impressive degree of accuracy.
When deciding on a calculator, your main con-
siderations are the following:
 What do you need the calculator for?
 What type of power source do you prefer
(solar or battery, for example)?
 What type and how large a display do you
want?
 How big do you want the keys on the keypad
(some of us have big fingers)?
The big names in calculators are Texas
Instruments, Hewlett-Packard, and Casio, but
you’ll find more brands if you hunt around
enough. The prices vary, and you can get spec-
tacular deals on eBay.
If you don’t want to invest in a hand-held calcu-
lator, you can find many online calculators that
are quite good. These online calculators are
usually geared to a specific chore: computing a
mortgage payment, figuring percentages, deter-
mining a rental amount, converting tempera-
tures or times, computing areas, and so on. In
some respects, online calculators make a lot
of sense, because technology is changing so
rapidly. After all, the calculator or computer you
bought yesterday is already obsolete.

The order of operations dictates that the 5 in this expression is raised to the
power first, and then the multiplication takes place. You don’t need to input
into your calculator the parentheses to be assured of having the operations
done in the correct order. (But they don’t hurt either.)
Distinguishing between subtraction and negativity
The subtraction symbol (–) is understood as being an operation. Subtraction
is one of the four basic binary operations. And, in algebra, students are told
that subtract, minus, negative, opposite, and less are all indicated with the
same symbol: the subtraction sign. The algebra ruling works fine when deal-
ing with algebraic expressions. But calculators are a bit fussy and make a dis-
tinction between the operation of subtraction (minus and less) and the
condition of being negative (opposite). Most scientific calculators have a sub-
traction button. You also find a separate negative button, which is distin-
guished from the subtraction button by parentheses: (–).
To get familiar with subtraction and negativity, determine how to enter the
following expressions in a calculator:
16 –18
–16 – (–18)
–34
Here’s how to enter the previous expressions in your calculator:

You can type in the parentheses, but they aren’t really necessary in this case.
But when in doubt, always use the parentheses to avoid errors. Look at the dif-
ference between not using parentheses around a negative number being raised
to a power and then using the parentheses. You get two different answers:

The answer to this first expression is –81, because the calculator raises the 3
to the fourth power and then changes the number to the opposite. If you
want the number –3 raised to the fourth power, you have to put parentheses
around both the negative and the 3. Notice that the answer is positive. Why?
Raising a negative number to the fourth power gives you a positive result. It’s
all tied to the order of operations.
Grouping operations successfully
Usually you won’t run into any difficulties if you use more parentheses than
necessary. I’m usually pretty heavy-handed with parentheses in math and
commas in writing (but my editor takes care of that). The parentheses help
you say what you mean — mathematically. Parentheses are needed if you
have more than one term in the denominator (or bottom) of a fraction or more
than one term in a radical. They’re supposed to make your intent clearer.

Going scientific with scientific notation
Scientific notation is used to write very large or very small numbers in a
useful, readable, compact form.
A number written in scientific notation consists of
[a number between 1 and 10] × [a power of 10]
For example, the number 234,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 written in scien-
tific notation looks like this: 2.34 × 1026
The power of 26 on the 10 tells you that the decimal point was moved 26
places, from the end of the last zero to directly behind the 2. The number
2.34 is between 1 and 10.
Now here’s an example at the opposite end of the spectrum — 
it includes a number that’s quite small. Writing the number
0.000000000000000000000000000000000000234567 in scientific notation
gives you: 2.34567 × 10–37.
A negative power is used in this instance, because very small numbers
require that the decimal point moves to the right to get the nonzero digit part
(the first number) to form a number between 1 and 10.
Calculators go into scientific notation mode when the result of a computation
is too large for the screen or has more digits than the calculator can handle.
Instead of displaying scientific notation like I do here, calculators show an E
and then, usually, the exponent. So, if you multiply numbers together and get
the result 4.3E16, the calculator is reporting that the answer is written in sci-
entific notation and is 4.3 × 1016 = 43,000,000,000,000,000.
Repeating operations: Simplifying your
work with a computer spreadsheet
Computer spreadsheets are truly wonderful tools. You not only get orderly
reports of numbers all typed out neatly and in regular rows and columns, but
you also have computing capability that’s equal to a calculator’s capability.
For instance, you can direct the computer spreadsheet to do all sorts of com-
putations, such as adding all the numbers in a column and performing multi-
plications and additions on selected numbers. And here’s the best thing: You
can then tell the spreadsheet to repeat these same operations over and over
on lots and lots of numbers. Now you can spend all that extra time lying on a
beach somewhere . . . .
62
Part II: Taking Intriguing Math to Work 

In this section, I don’t go into too much detail on how to enter formulas or
values, because different computer packages have different rules. But after
you see how tables of data are produced, hopefully you’ll be inspired to
check into the particular spreadsheet program that you have and find the
correct commands to type in.
In the following sections, I show you two examples of spreadsheets that
you can create. One shows you how to sum up the revenue from different
sources, and another determines the payment of an amortized loan.
Summing across rows or down columns
A useful type of table is one that shows the revenue from sales, where some
of the money from the month’s sales come in that month, another percentage
of those sales comes in the second month, and the rest (that actually does
come in) is received in the third month. Every month, the total amount of rev-
enue has to be tallied from the different sources — from previous months
and from the current billing.
Guess what? You can use a spreadsheet to determine the amounts of money
coming in each month as a percentage of particular sales. You also can use
the spreadsheet to find the sum of all the revenue sources for the month.
Show the entries for the columns of a spreadsheet where you expect to col-
lect 50% of the revenue from sales during the first month, 45% of the revenue
during the second month, 4% during the third month, and write off the last
1% as a bad debt. Table 5-1 shows the setup. You copy the three percentage
entries into the corresponding cells for each month. If you type in formulas
and refer to sales amounts in the first column, the spreadsheet does the com-
putations for you.

Chapter 5: Working with Formulas

The table, which extends down for each month’s revenue, could be extended
across for a full year or for several years. The spreadsheet does the computa-
tion for you, rounded to the number of decimal places you indicate in your
setup.
With one of the table commands available, you can find the sum of the num-
bers going across the rows of the table or those going down the columns. Just
highlighting and dragging across the values you want usually does the trick.
So the sum of the entries in the April column will come out to be 4% of
February’s revenue, 45% of March’s revenue, and 50% of April’s revenue. If
you change the sales amount (you find an extra $1,000 in April perhaps), the
formula structure of the table will not only adjust the percentage amount
across the row, but it also takes care of all the columns that are affected, too.
Creating an amortized loan schedule
You can determine the monthly payment of a particular loan using one of the
appropriate formulas (see Chapter 12 for more on loan formulas). But it gets
a bit tedious if you want to find the monthly payments involved in more than
one or two scenarios — where you change the interest rate a bit or the length
of the loan a bit. You don’t want to have to type the numbers into the calcula-
tor over and over again.
Thankfully, a computer spreadsheet makes a table of loan payments quickly
and accurately. You do have to type in the equation and set up the input
values, but after doing the preliminaries, you can immediately copy, drag,
and observe all the possibilities. The following example will walk you through
the process.
Create a chart of the monthly loan payments on a $100,000 loan where you
compare interest rates of 8%, 8.25%, 8.5% and 8.75%. Compare these rates at
15 years, 20 years, 25 years, and 30 years.
You start with a spreadsheet that has the interest rates, as decimals, at the
top of consecutive columns and the years at the beginning of rows. You can
see what I mean in Figure 5-1.

Part II: Taking Intriguing Math to Work 

I typed in the interest rates and years, but you can have the computer spread-
sheet fill in a bunch of consecutive amounts for you. By simply entering in a
command to add a certain amount to each successive value, you save yourself
a lot of typing.
For instance, in Figure 5-1 you enter the 15 for 15 years. Then in the cell
directly below that one, you enter a command such as “= A2+5.” The number
20 should appear in that cell. Now you can copy the command and drag down
through as many cells as you want, and each will show a number that’s 5 more
than the previous cell. The same thing works when moving across the interest
rates. You can increase by 0.25%, as shown in the figure, or you can pick some
other increment. Also, you can format the cells to produce just about any
number of decimal points. For example, you can set the format to show you
four decimal places; the numbers are then rounded to that many places.
Now you’re ready for the fun part: entering the formula referencing the cell
positions. The variables in your formula will be entries such as A2 or B3,
telling the formula to look at that particular row and column. To begin, remem-
ber that the formula for the monthly payment amount of an amortized loan is
R

where R is the amount of the regular payment, P is the amount borrowed, r⁄12
is the interest rate each month, and t is the number of years. (You can find all
the details on this formula in Chapter 12.)
Now you type the formula into cell B2 of the table. The following is one possi-
bility for the format of the formula (which is the one I use in my spreadsheet).
However, you need to check the instructions and help menu with your particu-
lar computer spreadsheet. Here’s the formula I used:
100,000*

Yes, this all fits into the one tiny cell. Actually, what you’ll see is just the
numerical answer in the cell. The formula should be available in the editing
box. You can then copy that cell and hold and drag to the right until the
whole row is highlighted. The spreadsheet picks up the interest values from
the respective column heads.
Figure 5-2 shows what your row in the spreadsheet should look like.

Chapter 5: Working with Formulas

When it comes to spreadsheets, you really need to just play around with them.
Say to yourself, “I wonder if I can get the spreadsheet to . . .” And, amazingly,
you usually can get the spreadsheet to do what you want. When in doubt, con-
sult the program manual for help.

S
ome people love numbers and find it easy to interpret pages full of them.
But others are intimidated by them. How can numbers be presented so
that they make sense to those who aren’t so great with numbers? Through
visuals such as graphs and charts.
Graphs and charts provide lots of information quickly. It’s true that a picture
is worth a thousand words. After all, you can quickly grasp the financial situa-
tion of a business when you see a line on a graph that represents earnings
sloping down.
These visuals don’t give you detailed information, but they do set the scene
as a whole. After you have the situation pictured in your mind, you can then
decide how far you need to drill down into the material in order to make an
informed decision.
The more common types of graphs are scatter plots, line graphs, and bar
graphs (or histograms). Scatter plots are numbers represented by dots dis-
tributed about a rectangular area. A line graph connects points to one
another. Trends and items that are connected — that affect one another —
are best shown with line graphs. In the section on line graphs, you see how to
get around the need for a uniform labeling. You also see how graphs can be
abused.
A bar graph is good for showing volumes or frequencies of items that may or
may not have a connection to one another. Other graphs you may use include
pie charts, where the different-sized pieces represent different portions of the
whole scene, and pictorial graphs, which catch your eye and make a state-
ment at the same time.

The purpose of graphs and charts is to show as much information as quickly,
efficiently, and accurately as possible. The labels on the axes are an equal
distance apart, and they have numbers that are the same distance apart.
With the information in this chapter, you can become better at choosing the
best type of graph or chart for your situation. This way you can easily get
your information to those folks who need it.
Organizing Scattered Information 
with a Scatter Plot
A scatter plot may look just like what its name implies: a bunch of dots scat-
tered all over the place. A scatter plot is used to see whether the data that it
represents has any visible trend or pattern. If the dots are scattered all over
the chart with no rhyme or reason, you can safely conclude that there’s no
correlation between the values that are being plotted. However, if you see the
plotted dots lying more in a clump or in an upward-leaning gathering, you may
determine that some connection or trend is taking place between the values.
Scatter plots, line graphs, and histograms are drawn with respect to two
axes. A horizontal axis and a vertical axis cross one another, and the intersec-
tion acts as a starting point for each set of information.
For example, you may keep records of the days’ temperatures and make a
chart of how many customers you have in your ice cream store on a day with
that certain temperature. Or you may be keeping track of the number of
hours a machine is run each day and how much it costs per hour to run the
machine (averaging in all the labor, materials, utilities, and so on).
In Figure 6-1, you see two scatter plots that are based on the previously men-
tioned examples. The scatter plot on the left-hand side represents customers
and temperatures; on the right-hand side, hours and average cost are plotted.
Keep in mind that a scatter plot is designed to help you determine whether
you see some cause and effect — some pattern or trend.

Part II: Taking Intriguing Math to Work 

A scatter plot doesn’t tell you the exact mathematical relationship between
two values, but it does show you whether such a relationship in fact exists. If
you think that a connection between two different entities does exist, you can
then try to write an equation or formula linking the values. (In Chapter 18, you
see how the behaviors of costs are related with a mathematical statement.)
To create a scatter plot, draw two intersecting perpendicular lines (called the
axes) and assign units to the lines based on what’s represented by the num-
bers you’ll be plotting. You place a point or dot to represent each set of num-
bers by lining the points up with the units on the axes.
Draw a scatter plot showing the data collected on the number of inches of
rain during the summer and the yield per acre of a crop. Table 6-1 shows the
data collected over an 8-year period.

The scatter plot has the number of inches of rain along the x-axis (or bottom
of the graph), and the yield per acre is shown along the y-axis (or side of the
graph). If a relationship is present between the amount of rain and the yield,
you should see a pattern emerging in the dots of the scatter plot. Just looking
at the data tells you very little. The numbers are all over the place and diffi-
cult to decipher.
Figure 6-2 shows you the scatter plot constructed from the data in Table 6-1.
The upward movement of the yield numbers as the rainfall increases seems
to suggest that there’s a relationship between the two values.
69
Chapter 6: Reading Graphs and Charts

Lining Up Data with Line Graphs
A line graph actually consists of a bunch of connected segments. A line graph
connects data that occurs sequentially over a period of time. You use a line
graph to show how values are connected when one point affects the next one.
For example, a line graph often is used to show how temperatures change
during a day, because the temperature one hour affects the temperature the
next hour. Another use for a line graph is to show the depreciation of a piece
of machinery or other property. The value of an item one year has a bearing
on the item’s value the next year. The following sections explain everything
you need to know about line graphs.
Creating a line graph
The axes used when creating a line graph have numbers or values represent-
ing different aspects of the data. The two axes usually have different number-
ing systems, because the values being compared most likely don’t even have
the same units. But the numbering on each axis should be uniform — spaced
equally and numbered consecutively.

Part II: Taking Intriguing Math to Work 

When constructing a line graph, you start out somewhat like you do with a
scatter plot: You draw your axes and then place points or dots to represent
the numbers from your data. The difference is that you connect one dot to
the next with a line segment. You do so in order to show that they’re con-
nected and changing.
Believe it or not, even a new Mercedes depreciates in value over the years.
Table 6-2 shows the first few years of one car’s value. Draw a line graph to
illustrate the value.
Table 6-2

$29,160

$27,120

$25,200
A line graph is used to display the information in Table 6-2, because one
year’s value of the car is tied to the previous year’s value and the next year’s
value. The line graph shown in Figure 6-3 shows the number of years since
the car’s purchase along the horizontal (x) axis and the value of the car on
the vertical (y) axis. The line graph helps you see how dramatically the value
of the car drops at first and how the drops in the value taper off as the car
gets older.
Indicating gaps in graph values
You want your graphs and charts to do a lot of explaining without words. So
you need to label the axes carefully, use a uniform scale on the axes, and plot
the values carefully.
71
Chapter 6: Reading Graphs and Charts

Some data sets don’t cooperate very well when it comes to setting up axes
that are constructed correctly and, at the same time, give good information.
Sometimes, for instance, problems arise when you want the intersection of
the axes to be 0 and the numbers to increase as you move to the right and
upward. But you don’t want your graph to be, say, 6 inches across and 90
inches high just to accommodate the numbering protocol. Instead, in this
case, you should indicate a gap in the numbering with a zigzag on the axis.
For example, if you want to create a line graph of the total city budget from
1993 through 2000, you may have to enter numbers in the billions. Even if you
knock off all the zeros and label your axis as being billions, the numbers go
from $5,168 billion to $5,758 billion. So you wouldn’t get much detail in the
graph from the numbers. On the left-hand side of Figure 6-4, you see a graph
of the total budget for 8 years. The scale is kept uniform and the numbers on
the axis go from $0 to $6,000 billion. You don’t see much detail or movement
from year to year considering the breadth of the range.
An alternative is to put in a break, which looks like a zigzag, to show that
values are missing in the numbering system on the axis. By doing so, you’re
still able to keep the remaining numbers uniformly distributed to give a
better picture of what’s going on. In the right-hand graph in Figure 6-4, you

see how a break in the axis allows more information to be conveyed by
spreading out the upper numbers for more detail. With this break, you see
the detail on just how quickly the budget is changing during particular years.
Measuring Frequency with Histograms
A histogram isn’t some cold remedy (though, doesn’t it sure sound like it?).
Histogram is another name for a bar graph. But, as you can probably tell, bar
graph is a bit more descriptive; in fact, you probably already have a picture in
your mind of what a bar graph is. However, because you’ll often hear these
graphs called histograms, I’ll stick with that term throughout this section.
Just know that you may see it referred to either way.
A histogram is a graph of frequencies — it shows how many of each. With a
bar’s height, a histogram shows the relative amount of each category. Unlike
a line graph, a histogram doesn’t have to have sequential numbers or dates
along the horizontal axis. Why? Because the value of one category doesn’t
affect the next one.
For instance, you can list the states along the bottom of a histogram to show
the area or population of each state. Or you can show the production of some
product.
Another nice feature of a histogram is that you can compare two entries of
each category — perhaps showing the difference between one year’s produc-
tion and the next. However, the vertical axis has to be uniform in labeling so
that the amounts or frequencies are represented fairly.

Chapter 6: Reading Graphs and Charts

To create a histogram, you start out with intersecting horizontal and vertical
axes. You list your categories to be graphed along the horizontal axis, and
you label the units along the vertical axis. Draw a thick line or rectangle
above each category to its corresponding height. The rectangles will be par-
allel to one another, but they’ll usually be different heights.
Create a histogram showing the number of hurricanes that hit the United
States in each decade of the 20th century. The numbers are as follows:
1901–1910, 18
1911–1920, 21
1921–1930, 13
1931–1940, 19
1941–1950, 24
1951–1960, 17
1961–1970, 14
1971–1980, 12
1981–1990, 15
1991–2000, 14
The histogram you create should have the decades listed along the horizon-
tal axis and the numbers 0 through 24 or 25 on the vertical axis. The bar rep-
resenting each frequency should be shaded in. The bars can be touching, but
they don’t have to be. Figure 6-5 shows my version of the histogram. I chose
not to have the bars touching, because only ten bars are needed.
A histogram makes comparing the relative number of hurricanes over the
20th century quite easy. With this graph, you can easily pick out when there
were twice as many hurricanes during one decade than there were in another.
Try another example: Suppose a flag and decorating company sells five differ-
ent types of products: flags, banners, table decorations, flag stands, and com-
memorative pins. The manager wants you to create a histogram showing the
total sales of each category for two consecutive years. Table 6-3 shows the
total sales for each category.

You see that each category had an increase in sales. By creating a histogram
with the two years’ sales side by side, you can see how the increases com-
pare proportionately in each category. Also, the histogram allows you to
better understand where the main emphasis is for the company — where
most of the revenue comes from in the different sales. See Figure 6-6 to see a
completed histogram for this scenario.
A picture can’t tell you everything. You can see the relative changes and the
comparable revenue amounts. But if you want to determine the actual per-
cent changes and the proportionate amount that each product contributes to
the total revenue, you have to figure the percentages. In Chapter 3, you find
all the information you need on percent increases and decreases.

Chapter 6: Reading Graphs and Charts

Taking a Piece of a Pie Chart
A pie chart is a circle divided into wedges where each wedge or piece of the
pie is a proportionate amount of the total — based on the actual numerical
figures. Pie charts are especially useful for showing budget items — where
certain amounts of money are going. To create a pie chart, you divide the
circle proportionately and draw in the radii (the edges of the pieces). The fol-
lowing sections explain pie charts in more detail.
Dividing the circle with 
degrees and percents
Think of a circle as being divided into 360 separate little wedges. (A circle’s
angles all add up to 360 degrees.) Just one of the 360 little wedges is difficult
to see — you may not even notice a drawing of one degree in a picture. Table
6-4 shows you many of the more useful fractional divisions of a circle. (I talk
more about degrees in Chapter 7, if you need more information.)

Chapter 7
Measuring the World around You
In This Chapter
 Moving between different measurement units
 Using the metric system
 Understanding the secret of properly measuring lumber
 Matching angles and degrees
W
henever you use a ruler, a yardstick, a tape measure, a scale, or a
thermometer, you venture into the world of units of measurement.
Measures are pretty much standardized throughout the different countries
of the world. And gone are the days of using hands (although horses are still
referred to as so many hands tall), joints of the thumb, and the distance from
your nose to the tip of your outstretched arm. You can now depend on the
simple plastic ruler to give you the same measures as the next person’s ruler.
When using measurements, you pick the most convenient unit for the situa-
tion. For instance, you aren’t going to use inches when measuring the size of
a parking lot, and you aren’t going to use tons when weighing boxes of nails.
You go with what makes sense. But having said that, you still may have
opportunities to mix and match measures, so in this chapter I show you a
quick and easy setup that works for all your conversion problems.
Also important in this chapter is my discussion on using the metric system.
The world is roughly 96% metric and 4% English as far as measurement sys-
tems. The metric system seems to become popular periodically in the United
States, but the interest comes and goes. In the mid-1970s, there was a huge
push to go metric. (I still have my “Go Metric” bumper sticker.) The switch to
metric in the U.S. will probably never happen, but as long as Americans con-
tinue to do business with other countries, you’ll still occasionally (or often!)
need to understand and work with metric measures.
Finally, I round off this chapter with a section on using angles and degrees.
I show you how to break degrees into smaller units, and I also explain how to
subdivide angles.

Converting from Unit to Unit
You know that 12 inches equals a foot and that 4 cups are in a quart. But
what about changing 16 yards to inches or 400 ounces to pounds? Are you
still comfortable when faced with these measures? I hope so. But just in case
you aren’t, I offer a basic conversion formula in this section that works for all
unit-swapping that you may have to do. You do need to start with the basic
equivalents (such as 5,280 feet = 1 mile), but after those basics are estab-
lished, the rest is straightforward and consistent.
Using the conversion proportion
You can probably do the easier unit conversions in your head (such as
24 inches equals 2 feet), but sometimes you won’t be sure whether you have
to multiply or divide to change from one unit to another. Don’t worry. In this
case, you can fall back on a simple proportion. You put in the known value,
create two fractions, cross-multiply, and pull out the needed values.
In general, you always start out with an equation of a basic, known measure-
ment formula (such as 1 bushel equals 1.24 cu. ft.). Then you put the two
sides of the formula into the two numerators (tops) of two fractions. The
value to be converted goes under one side of the fraction (the side with the
matching unit). You place an x under the other side. Finally, you cross-multiply
and solve for x. So in other words, the general setup for converting one unit
of measure to another is
x
x
Same units as left side or
Left side of known formula
Same units as right side or
Right side of known formula
=
The proportion looks rather vague, so I offer several examples to help illus-
trate how to use the equation for conversions. (If you need help with propor-
tions or basic algebraic equations, refer to those topics in Chapter 4.)
If 1 U.S. dollar is equal to 0.65 euro, how many euros is 45 dollars?
You may immediately say, “Piece of cake. I just multiply to find the euros.”
And you’d be correct. But please bear with me and use the conversion pro-
portion. Getting used to setting up the formulas and values in a simpler prob-
lem helps you out when the situation gets more complex.
After plugging the numbers into the conversion proportion, you get this
equation:
x
45 dollars
1 dollar
euros
0.65 euro
=
80
Part II: Taking Intriguing Math to Work 

Notice that you have dollars under dollars and euros under euros. Now cross-
multiply to solve for x:
.

45 dollars
1 dollar

=
=

$
$
As you can see, 45 dollars equals 29.25 euros.
Here’s another problem to practice: How many dollars is 39,600 euros? Do
you multiply or divide to solve this problem? What do you divide by?
Using the conversion proportion, you start with the basic formula (which you
discovered in the previous example problem and can find daily on the Internet
or at a bank) and put the 39,600 euros under the part of the formula with euros:
x dollars
1 dollar
39,600 euros
0.65 euro
=
Now you cross-multiply. After doing so, you see that x has a multiplier. Divide
each side of the equation by that multiplier. Here’s what your work should
look like:
,

You find that it takes almost $61,000 to equal 39,600 euros.
Lining up the linear measures
A linear measure has one dimension — how long it is. Think of measuring
along a straight line. The standard linear measures are inches, feet, yards,
rods, and miles. (Metric linear measures are found in the later section,
“Making Sense of the Metric System.”)
The following are some of the most commonly used linear measure 
equivalences:
1 yard = 3 feet = 36 inches
1 rod = 16.5 feet
1 mile = 5,280 feet
1 furlong = 660 feet = 220 yards
81
Chapter 7: Measuring the World around You

Try your hand at some linear conversions with the following example.
Suppose you need to measure the length and width of a storage room but you
forgot your tape measure. You have a pocket calendar that you know is 7
inches long, and you have your clipboard, which is 15 inches long. So you
measure the length and width of the storage room with these items. You
come up with a dimension of 18 clipboards and 12 pocket calendars long by
18 clipboards and 1 pocket calendar wide. What are the dimensions of the
room in feet?
First, change the clipboard and calendar measures to inches. The length
is (18 × 15 inches) + (12 × 7 inches) = 270 + 84 = 354 inches. The width is 
(18 × 15 inches) + (1 × 7 inches) = 270 + 7 = 277 inches.
Now change inches to feet using the conversion proportion. First, find the
length:
x
x

x

$
So the garage is 29 feet 6 inches by 23 feet 1 inch.
Spreading out with measures of area
An area measurement is really just the total number of a bunch of connected
squares. When you say that you have a room that measures 36 square feet,
you mean that 36 squares, each 1 foot by 1 foot, would fit in that room. Of
course, most rooms aren’t exactly 6 feet x 6 feet, 9 feet x 4 feet, or some other
combination of whole numbers. More often, a room will be 8 feet, 3 inches by
4 feet, 4.5 inches. If you’ve ever had to lay square tiles in a room, you know
that even if the room was meant to be square it doesn’t always come out that
way. Thank goodness for tile cutters.
82
Part II: Taking Intriguing Math to Work 

Area is used for orders of carpeting or tile; area is used to determine how
much land you have to build on; area is important when you plan your fac-
tory or storage area. To find the area of a region, you use an appropriate area
formula. To find the area of a rectangle, for example, you use a different for-
mula than you would to find the area of a triangle. In Figure 7-1, I show you
several types of regions and the formulas you use for finding the area.
You need to identify which type of region you have before you can apply
the correct formula. If your region doesn’t match any of the types shown in
Figure 7-1, you need to break the region into rectangles or triangles and find
the area of each. You see examples of this method in Chapter 21.
The following examples give you a chance to practice calculating some areas
with the formulas given in Figure 7-1.
Find the area of a rectangular room that measures 19 feet, 9 inches in length
by 15 feet, 4 inches in width.
As you can see in Figure 7-1, the area of a rectangle is length × width. For the
computations, you need the measures to be in either inches or feet, and feet
makes the most sense when measuring rooms. So first you need to change the
feet and inches to just feet. The length is 19 feet, 9 inches, which is 193⁄4 feet.
The width of 15 feet, 4 inches is 15 1⁄3 feet. Multiply the two measures, like so:

Chapter 7: Measuring the World around You

The area is 3025⁄6 sq. ft. (If you don’t remember how to deal with multiplying
mixed numbers, head to Chapter 1 where I cover this math in detail.)
A triangular lawn measures 300 yards on one side, 400 yards on the second
side, and 500 yards on the third side. Find the area of the triangle.
One method of finding the area of this triangle is to use this formula:
A
bh
2
1
=
In this case, you multiply one side of the triangle, b, by the height drawn per-
pendicular to that side up to the opposite corner, h. Then you take one half of
the product. Quite often, though, you don’t have a way of measuring that per-
pendicular height. Your fallback in this situation is Heron’s formula.
To find the area of a triangle whose sides measure a, b, and c in length, use
Heron’s formula, which looks like this:
A
s s

s

s

=

^

where s is the semi-perimeter (half the perimeter). In other words, 
s = 1⁄2 (a + b + c).
For example, to find the area of the triangular lawn whose sides measure 300,
400, and 500 yards, use Heron’s formula. First, you have to find the semi-
perimeter, which is half of the sum of the sides. 300 + 400 + 500 = 1,200. So,
the semi-perimeter is found like this: 1⁄2 (1,200) = 600 yards. Now use Heron’s
formula to get

So the lawn measures 60,000 sq. yd. in area.
If you’re a fan of Pythagoras (the guy who discovered the relationship between
the squares of the sides of any right triangle), you probably noticed that the
sides of the previously mentioned triangle make a right triangle. With a right
triangle, the two shorter sides are perpendicular to one another, and you can
use the quicker formula (A = 1⁄2 bh) for the area of a triangle. But the sides of a
right triangle also make for a nice result using Heron’s formula, and I preferred
showing you a nice result.
You may have looked at the area of 60,000 sq. yd. and said, “Wow. That’s a lot
of yardage!” Or, maybe you’re having difficulty imagining 60,000 sq. yd. and
need more of a hint of how big that is. If so, read on.
84
Part II: Taking Intriguing Math to Work 

The following are the most commonly used area equivalences:
1 square foot = 144 square inches
1 square yard = 9 square feet = 1,296 square inches
1 square mile = 3,097,600 square yards = 27,878,400 square feet = 640 acres
So 60,000 sq. yd. isn’t all that big compared to 1 sq. mi.
How many acres are in 60,000 sq. yd.?
From the previous list of area equivalences, you see that 3,097,600 sq. yd. is
equal to 640 acres. Set up the conversion proportion with the equation
involving square yards and acres in the numerators, and with 60,000 sq. yd.
under the 3,097,600 square yards. Solve for the unknown number of acres.
Your math should look like this:

Chapter 7: Measuring the World around You
Who was Heron of Alexandria?
Heron of Alexandria, who lived around 67 A.D.,
discovered and wrote about many diverse math-
ematical topics. In fact, he’s credited with sev-
eral formulas, and he commented on the work of
other mathematicians, such as Archimedes.
Heron is also credited with the following:
 Determining the formula for the volume of
the frustum of a cone
 Discovering a creative technique used to
solve a quadratic equation
 Producing some good approximations of
the square root of a number that isn’t a per-
fect square
Much of Heron’s math is found in his work,
Metrica, which was discovered in the late 1800s
in a 12th-century manuscript in Constantinople.
Heron’s real claim to fame, however, is his for-
mula for finding the area of a triangle using the
lengths of the sides.

Adding a third dimension: Volume
Volume is measured by how many cubes you can fit into a structure. (A cube
is like a game die or a lump of sugar.) When you talk about the size of a factory
or office building, you give measures in terms of square feet. But the building
really has a third dimension: the height of each room. You don’t know, from the
square footage of a building, whether the rooms have ceilings that are 7 feet,
12 feet, or more above the floor. The amount of volume in a building plays a
huge role when trying to heat and air-condition the space. It also makes a dif-
ference when it comes to painting, wallpapering, and decorating.
Finding volume
The volume of any right rectangular prism (better known as a box) is found by
multiplying the length by the width by the height of the prism. The volume
then comes out in terms of how many cubes can fit in the prism. Not all struc-
tures are made completely of right angles, so pieces and slices of cubes get
involved. But the different formulas you can use make up for any adjustments
from the standard cube.
Here are the formulas for some of the more commonly used three-dimensional
structures:
Right rectangular prism (box): V = lwh, where l, w, and h represent
length, width, and height, respectively
Prism: V = Bh, where B is the area of the base and h is the height
Pyramid: V
Bh
3

=
, where B is the area of the base of the pyramid and h
is the height perpendicular from the base to the tip of the pyramid
Cylinder: V = πr2h, where r is the radius and h is the height
Sphere: V

Suppose that a room is 20 feet by 35 feet and has a vaulted ceiling that starts
slanting at the 7-foot level and reaches a peak at 14 feet above the floor. The
peak runs lengthwise down the room. What’s the total air volume of the room?
Figure 7-2 shows a sketch of the room. The two ends of the vaulted ceiling
form a triangle, so the area above the 7-foot level of the walls is determined
by finding the volume of a triangular prism.
First, find the volume of the rectangular bottom part of the room with V = lwh:
V = (35 feet)(20 feet)(7 feet)
= 4,900 cu. ft.
86
Part II: Taking Intriguing Math to Work 

Now find the area of the triangular upper part of the room (which has a trian-
gular base). You can find the area like this:
A
bh
2

The area of the triangle is 70 sq. ft. Multiply that area by the height of the tri-
angular prism, 35 feet, and you get 70 × 35 = 2,450 cu. ft.
Don’t confuse the base of the triangular prism that’s used to find the volume
of the three-dimensional figure with the base of the triangle that’s used to find
the area of the end piece of the room. The Base of the triangle is an area mea-
sure and the base of the triangle is a linear measure.
So the total air volume of the room is 4,900 + 2,450 = 7,350 cu. ft. A lot of
warm air goes up into the peak of the ceiling — which is good in the summer
but bad in the winter.

Heating and cooling the Great Pyramid
When you begin to think that your energy bills
are over the top, think about the challenges of
climate control in huge structures such as
amphitheaters, factories, or malls. And what
about the Great Pyramid? It isn’t really hollow,
but what if it were? Imagine the bill for air-con-
ditioning a structure of that size and dimension.
The Great Pyramid was originally about 481 feet
tall, and its square base had sides measuring
about 756 feet. The volume of the pyramid was

Understanding volume equivalences
If I declare that the volume of the Great Pyramid is over 91 million cu. ft., you
may not quite see the magnitude of the landmark. Even 1 million cu. ft. is diffi-
cult to comprehend. So here are some equivalences to help put the Great
Pyramid (and other large stuff) in perspective:
1 cubic foot = 1,728 cubic inches
1 cubic yard = 27 cubic feet = 46,656 cubic inches
1 cord = 128 cubic feet
1 cubic mile = 147,197,952,000 cubic feet
Some restaurants have wood-burning fireplaces to add ambience to the
dining experience. So they have to order and store firewood. How many
cords of firewood can Gloria, manager of Gloria’s Fine Dining, fit into a 
storage shed that’s 12 feet long by 8 feet wide by 6 feet high?
First find the volume in cubic feet by multiplying the length by the width by
the height (V = lwh):
V = (12 feet)(8 feet)(6 feet)
= 576 cubic feet
Now write a conversion proportion with the cord and cubic feet:

Making Sense of the Metric System
The metric system of measurement is used by 96% of the world’s population. The
metric system is popular because of its simplicity. Each type of measure (length,
volume, and mass) is based on a single unit and on powers of ten of that unit.
For lengths or linear measures, the unit is the meter; for volume, it’s the liter;
and for mass or weight, it’s the gram.
88
Part II: Taking Intriguing Math to Work 

Another beauty of the system is the way the different types of measures inter-
act with one another. The gram, for example, is equal to 1 cubic centimeter of
water, which is equal to 1 milliliter. Add that to the fact that the metric units
are interchangeable with one another and also that conversions use decimals
rather than fractions, and the metric system seems to make the most sense
for use universally. Even so, the United States is still holding out and chooses
to stick to its traditional English system of measure.
No matter what the United States does, you’re likely to run into metrics when
you’re dealing with numbers from other countries. When that happens, just
read through this section, which provides the basics.
Moving from one metric unit to another
Converting from one unit to another in the metric system involves nothing
more than sliding the decimal point to the right or left. Changing 4.5 decame-
ters to centimeters, for example, means moving the decimal point three
points to the right. So 4.5 decameters = 4,500 centimeters. If you know your
prefixes, you’re in business to convert from one metric unit to another. The
scale in Figure 7-3 shows the relative positions of the different prefixes used
in the metric system.
The prefixes tell you the size of a single metric measure. For example, a kilo-
meter is 1,000 meters, and a milliliter is one-thousandth of a liter. You use the
same prefixes for each of the types of measures. So 1 kilogram equals 1,000
grams. As you can imagine, this uniformity keeps the conversions much 
simpler.
Say that you buy 3.12 liters of olive oil and want to divide it into milliliter
spoonfuls for your restaurant’s signature dish. How many milliliters are in
3.12 liters?

Chapter 7: Measuring the World around You

Look at the scale shown in Figure 7-3. To go from liters (the main unit on the
scale) to milliliters, you have to move the decimal point three places to the
right. So 3.12 liters is 3,120 milliliters. Not too difficult, is it?
Now imagine that you measure along a stretch of road next to your bed-and-
breakfast with a centimeter ruler (don’t ask why you forgot your tape mea-
sure). You come up with 3,243 centimeters. When you order bedding plants
to line that stretch of road from a European supplier, you have to use metrics.
How many decameters is 3,243 centimeters?
By looking at Figure 7-3, you can see that to go from centimeters to decame-
ters, you have to move three decimal places to the left. The number 3,243 has
its decimal point at the right end, so you get 3.243 decameters. Nice work!

Part II: Taking Intriguing Math to Work 
Blame it on the French: Discovering where
the metric system came from
It was the French, in the late 1700s, who decided
that enough was enough. The countries of the
world used dozens of different measurement
systems. The different standards of measure-
ment caused a lot of confusion and difficulties,
especially when the countries began trying to
trade with one another. The French wanted to
develop a system to be used throughout the
world. They decided that a decimal-based
system made the most sense; powers of ten
allowed for simple conversions. Little by little,
this same metric system has been adopted by
countries around the world. As of 2007, only
three countries in the world have chosen not to
use the metric system: Liberia, Myanmar, and
the United States. Even though the UK has offi-
cially adopted the metric system, it continues to
use a mixture of metric and Imperial measures.
The meter, the gram, and the liter are the three
different types of measures making up the
metric system. An attempt was made to con-
nect the basic measures to naturally occurring
structures or physical quantities. The meter was
originally defined as being one forty-millionth of
the polar circumference of the world. And the
kilogram was to be the mass of 1 liter (1 cubic
decimeter) of water at 4 degrees Celsius. The
meter was later defined as being the distance
traveled by light in an absolute vacuum during
about one three hundred millionth of a second.
(Oh, yeah, I measure that every day.)
The metric system also has measures of tem-
perature. In the metric or Celsius system, water
freezes at 0 degrees and boils at 100 degrees
(rather than the Fahrenheit scale of 32 degrees
to 212 degrees).
The pros and cons abound regarding whether
the United States should change or not change
to the metric system. But I won’t bore you with
the details here. Suffice it to say that if the U.S.
did decide to change, why would we ever have
to teach students how to add fractions? Imagine
generations of children not having to find
common denominators — so sad.

Converting from metric to English 
and vice versa
One of the reasons that the metric system was developed was to eliminate
the need for converting from one system to another. Two hundred years later,
we’re still doing the measurement conversions. At least, we’re down to two
basic systems and some pretty standard conversion values. However, in this
section, you’ll see that the numbers aren’t exactly pretty. Converting from
metric to English or English to metric isn’t an exact science — and I mean
that literally. The measures are approximate — or as close as three decimal
places can get you.
Here are some of the more frequently used values when converting from
metric to English or English to metric:
1 mile = 1.609 kilometers
1 kilometer = 0.621 mile
1 foot = 0.305 meters
1 meter = 1.094 yards
1 inch = 2.54 centimeters
1 centimeter = 0.394 inch
1 quart = 0.946 liter
1 liter = 1.057 quarts
1 gallon = 3.785 liters
1 liter = 0.264 gallon
1 pound = 453.592 grams
1 kilogram = 2.205 pounds
In practical, everyday computations, it’s more common to use 1.6 for the
number of kilometers in a mile and 2.2 for the number of pounds in a kilo-
gram. You have to decide, depending on the application, just how precise
you need to be.
While on a business trip in Europe, you read on a sign that it’s 400 km to
Hamburg. How far is that in miles?
You can use the following conversion proportion to determine the number
of miles:

You have about 250 miles to go. If you can drive at 50 miles per hour, that’s a
5-hour drive. How many hours is that in Germany? (Just kidding — no conver-
sion needed here. But do watch out for the 24-hour clock!)

Chapter 7: Measuring the World around You

Suppose you’re told that you need to buy 23 gallons of paint so that your
maintenance worker can finish a project in the apartment complex that you
own and rent out. The paint you want only comes in liter cans. How many
liter cans will it take to finish the project?
Use the following conversion proportion involving gallons and liters to find out:

So you can see that it will take a few more than 87 liter cans of paint. Now
the difficult decision is whether to buy that 88th can. You have to decide
whether the maintenance guy can squeeze an extra 0.055 liter of paint out
of the last can.
Discovering How to Properly
Measure Lumber
Have you ever been to a lumber yard? No aroma quite matches that of stacks
and stacks of wood — all types of trees and all ages of planks. I have a friend
whose business is carving out and constructing cellos. He creates cellos from
hunks (very nice hunks) of wood. He buys the wood and then lets it sit for
about five years to age before working on it. Such patience.
Your exposure to a lumber yard is probably more utilitarian: You need to do
some repair to a rental property, you need more shelves in your shop, or you
decide to subdivide the showroom portion of your business. In any case, you
need to be aware of the pitfalls of measuring spaces and trying to get the
lumber measurements to coincide.
You’ve undoubtedly heard of pieces of wood referred to as 2 x 4s or 4 x 6s.
But did you also know that these measures are lies? A 2 x 4 is really a 1.5 x
3.5. This discrepancy isn’t a conversion issue. It’s basically a shrinkage and
finishing issue.
Shocked? Yeah, I was too when I found out. But don’t worry. You just need to
take into account the actual size of the lumber you’re buying if you need a par-
ticular thickness of a wall or deck area. If you don’t add on enough lumber,
you’re apt to come up short! In Table 7-1, I give you some of the more common
sizes of lumber pieces and their actual sizes.

11⁄2 inches x 51⁄2 inches
4 inches x 4 inches
31⁄2 inches x 31⁄2 inches
4 inches x 6 inches
31⁄2 inches x 51⁄2 inches
Try your hand at this example: Suppose you’re building a loading dock on the
back of a floral business that’s going to be 30 feet long and 12 feet wide. You
plan to run the planks perpendicular to the building (and parallel to the 12-
foot side) and allow for drainage between the planks. If you allow a 1⁄8-inch
gap between each plank, how many rows of 1 x 6 planks do you need to build
the deck?
You need 30 feet of 1 x 6 planks laid side by side. As I mention in Table 7-1, the
actual size of a 1 x 6 is 3⁄4 inch x 51⁄2 inches. Don’t worry about the thickness of
3⁄4 inch. Instead, simply add 1⁄8 inch (the gap) to each plank width of 51⁄2 inches
to get 55⁄8 inch units (plank plus gap). Here’s the addition of the fractions:

Need some guidance on adding fractions? I show you how in Chapter 1. Now

to get 360 inches. Now divide 360 by 55⁄8, like so:

Chapter 7: Measuring the World around You

Measuring Angles by Degrees
Angle measurements are important to carpenters, architects, pilots, and sur-
veyors. The scientific measurement of angles is usually done in radians,
because a radian is a more naturally occurring size (slightly more than
57 degrees). But most of us think of angles in terms of degrees.
A degree is 360
1
of a circle — a very tiny wedge. Using the number 360 to 
divide a circle into equal pieces was rather clever. After all, 360 has plenty
of divisors. You can divide a circle into many, many equal pieces, because
360 divides evenly by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 45, 60,
72, 90, 120, and 180.
In this section, I show you the properties of angles in figures, and I explain
how to subdivide an angle. In Chapter 6, I show you some sketches of the
more commonly used angle measures. And in Chapter 21, you can find the
different ways that angles are used in navigational and surveying directions.
Breaking down a degree
Angle measurements are made with instruments specifically designed for the
process. A protractor is one of these instruments. They’re usually in the shape
of a half circle and allow you to measure angles of up to 180 degrees. The pro-
tractor has marks on it for all the degree measures from 0 to 180.
It isn’t practical to try to divide a degree into units that are smaller than the
ones on these hand-held protractors. Most people wouldn’t be able to see the
divisions, anyway. When navigating the skies or the seas, though, a fraction
of a degree one way or the other can make a huge difference in whether you
reach your destination.
As I mention earlier, a degree is 360
1
of a circle. Each degree is itself subdivided 
into 60 smaller units called minutes. Each minute is subdivided into 60 smaller
units called seconds. So each degree — which is small to begin with — is
divided into 60 × 60 = 3,600 smaller portions for increased accuracy. A single
prime (') indicates minutes, and a double prime (") indicates seconds. So, the
angle measure given as 55°45'15" is read as 55 degrees, 45 minutes, 15 seconds.
The degree-minute-second notation is just grand, but it isn’t very helpful
when combining with other numbers in operations. For instance, if you want
to multiply the angle measuring 55°45'15" by 6, you have to multiply each
subdivision by 6, rewrite the minutes and seconds so that they don’t exceed
59 of each, and adjust the numbers accordingly. So usually you’ll find it much
94
Part II: Taking Intriguing Math to Work 

easier to change the angle measure to a decimal before multiplying or other-
wise combining. I show you how to do this in the following example. And, just
in case you doubt my judgment on which method is easier, I include the math
for both.
Multiply 55°45'15" by 6.
Method 1: Multiply each unit by 6 and adjust.
55° × 6 = 330°.
45' × 6 = 270'. To adjust, divide by 60. 270' ÷ 60 = 4 plus a remainder of 30.
Because 60 minutes makes a degree, this result represents 4 degrees and
30 minutes.
15" × 6 = 90". Adjust by dividing 90 by 60. 90" ÷ 60 = 1 plus a remainder of
30. Sixty seconds makes a minute, so this result represents 1 minute and
30 seconds.
Now combine all the degrees, minutes, and seconds from the multiplica-
tions and adjustments. Degrees: 330 + 4 = 334°. Minutes: 30 + 1 = 31'.
So the final result is 334°31'30".
Method 2: Change the measure to a decimal and multiply by 6.
Divide the number of minutes by 60 and the number of seconds by 3,600
to get the decimal equivalent of each unit. Then add the decimals to the
degree measure.
45' 60 = 0.75 and 15" ÷ 3,600 ≈0.0041667. If you add the decimals to the
degree measure, you get 55 + 0.75 + 0.0041667 = 55.7541667.
Multiplying the sum by 6 gives you: 55.7541667 × 6 = 334.5250002.
Now to compare the answers from the two methods, change the 334°31'30" to
a decimal by dividing the 31' by 60 and the 30" by 3,600. 31' ÷ 60 ≈0.5166667,
and 30" ÷ 3,600 ≈0.0083333. So 334°31'30" = 334 + 0.5166667 + 0.0083333 =
334.5250000. With rounding, the two answers differ by 0.0000002. Not too bad.
Fitting angles into polygons
A polygon is a dead parrot. Get it? Polly gone? Sorry. That’s lame math teacher
humor. Okay, the real scoop is that a polygon is a many-sided closed figure
made up of segments. What I mean by closed is that each segment is con-
nected by its endpoints to two other segments; in other words, you have an
inside and an outside. You can determine the total number of degrees of the
angles inside a polygon if you know how many sides there are.
95
Chapter 7: Measuring the World around You

A polygon with n sides has interior angles measuring a total of 180(n – 2)
degrees. Here are some examples plugged into the formula:
A triangle has three sides, so the total of all the degrees inside it is 
180(3 – 2) = 180(1) = 180 degrees.
A rectangle has four sides, so the total of all the degrees inside it is 
180(4 – 2) = 180(2) = 360 degrees.
A hexagon has six sides, so the total of all the degrees inside it is 
180(6 – 2) = 180(4) = 720 degrees.
You know that not all areas in a building follow the nice geometric shapes —
you have nooks and crannies and other odd outcroppings. So does this rule
for the total interior angles still work for odd shapes? You betcha! Check out
the following example, which proves my point.
Figure 7-4 shows a possible layout for a large work area. The angle measures
are shown at each interior angle. What’s the total of the interior angle mea-
sures of the area shown in the figure?
The area has eight sides. Using the formula, you get 180(8 – 2) = 180(6) = 1,080
degrees for a total of the inside angles. Does this match with the degrees shown
in the sketch? Add up the angles to find out: 77 + 90 + 90 + 270 + 270 + 90 + 90 +
103 = 1,080 degrees. Yup! The formula works, even with odd-shaped areas.

Analyzing Data and Statistics
In This Chapter

 Including standard deviation in your analysis
D
id you know that an author has published a book entitled How to Lie
with Statistics? Actually, you could change the word statistics to just
about any mathematical term and easily come up with some examples of
how to mislead readers. But statistics especially seem to lend themselves
to misinterpretation and abuse.
The world of statistics consists of figuring out how to collect data, organizing
your data, and then drawing meaningful conclusions. The conclusions you
draw will deal with the average (or middle value) and the spread around the
average. You use computations with formulas or charts and graphs.
In business, it’s important to present statistics as clearly and neutrally as
possible. It’s always tempting to put a positive spin on data, but if the num-
bers are trending down, the leaders in the company need to know. And if
you’re assessing the stats of another company, you need to understand how
to determine whether the numbers have been slanted to present a pretty pic-
ture that doesn’t match reality.
In this chapter, I don’t tell you how to ferret out all the spin, but I can make
you more aware of the potential for misuse. If you’re a knowledgeable reader
or consumer of statistics, you’ll have less of a chance of being duped. So I
offer information on how data is organized and how computations are made.
Organizing Raw Data
Data is information. Data is facts and figures. Data is something that’s known.
One problem with raw numerical data is that it’s often presented or available
in a format that gives little useful information regarding what it’s all about.

For instance, if you’re given a list of the number of cars sold each day of the
year at a dealership and it goes something like 4, 7, 6, 5, 8, 7, 6, 5, 7, 5, 4, and
so on, you’re likely to say, “Wait! This is meaningless!” And you’d be right.
A list of numbers like this may tell you that no more than 8 cars were sold
on any one day, but it doesn’t tell you such things as
 How many cars are sold on each day of the week?
 How much revenue is attached to the number of cars sold?
 What number of cars sold in a day happens more frequently?
 What days of the week yield the most car sales?
 What’s the average number of cars sold?
Many other useful bits of information could add meaning to these numbers.
The key to using data successfully is to have it organized. When the data is
organized, you can draw conclusions, do computations, and make predictions.
In the following sections, I provide a few options for organizing your data.
Creating a frequency distribution
A frequency distribution is one structure or process for organizing data. It tells
you how often a particular score or value occurs. For example, a frequency
distribution is a good way to present the following information:
 The number of customers who come into your shop each day.
 The number of cell phones activated during each hour that your busi-
ness is open.
 The number of stops made by the delivery person during each shift.
With a frequency distribution, you gather all the scores or values that are the
same and count how many of them you have. For example, say that you have
a list of 75 numbers. Almost all the numbers repeat. Rather than add all 75
numbers one at a time, you can organize them in a frequency distribution. By
doing so, you determine how many of each number there are (how many 5s,
how many 7s, and so on), and then you use multiplication and addition to get
the result. In other words, you multiply the number of times the number
occurs by that number and add the products together.
This method gives you an easier and more accurate result. After all, when
a list of numbers is too long, you may tend to lose track of where you are in
your addition and make errors. How many times have you had to start all
over again when dealing with long lists of numbers?
98
Part II: Taking Intriguing Math to Work 

A frequency distribution is usually presented as a table in which all the possi-
ble scores or numbers are listed in order (from lowest to highest or highest
to lowest). A tally is made in another column. A tally consists of hash marks
(| | |) where you make a mark for each number and slice through four of the
hash marks when you get to a group of five, like this: |||| . You probably
used these tallies as a kid when you were in competition with your friends.
Table 8-1 shows a frequency distribution of the following numbers: 4, 7, 6, 5,
8, 7, 6, 5, 7, 5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 8, 6, 4, 3, 5, 6, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 4, 3, 6,
4, 5, 6, 0, 6, 5, 3, 6, 3, 5, 6, 7, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6, 7, 7, 8, 5, 6, 5, 4, 6, 6, 6,
4, 3, 3. The numbers in the table go from a low of 0 to a high of 8. The third
column gives the frequency of each number, which is simply the result of the
tallies in the second column. The total is obtained from adding the numbers
in the frequency column.

Grouping values together 
in a frequency distribution
Sometimes a tally involves many items with a wide range of values. For
instance, you may have the length of time (in minutes) that customers walk
through your company’s showroom. Listing all the possible values may take
a page or two of paper — especially when the range is from 0 to 100 or from
99
Chapter 8: Analyzing Data and Statistics

1,000 to 10,000 (that would be a long time to wander the showroom). One
method that eliminates the need for so many numbers is to do groupings of
values.
For example, you can make groups that consist of all the numbers from 1 to 5,
6 to 10, 11 to 15, and so on. The only stipulation is that you keep the group-
ings equivalent in terms of size. A good rule of thumb is to plan on having
about ten different groupings of numbers (give or take a few).
Groupings are a good way to present information such as
 The salary amounts of your office’s employees.
 The number of light bulbs sold in your store on any given day.
 The number of plates of spaghetti sold in an evening at your restaurant.
To determine how to divide a set of numbers into groups, look at the range of
numbers or values that you have collected. What’s the range from the highest
number to the lowest? If your listing of numbers goes from a low of 3 to a
high of 97, your range is 95 numbers (97 – 3 + 1; you add the 1 so that both 3
and 97 are included in the count).
After you find your range, divide that number by 10 (which, as I mention ear-
lier, is a good number of groupings to have). If you divide 95 by 10, you get
9.5. In this case, the best arrangement probably would be to have ten group-
ings of ten numbers.
So now you can let the first grouping be the numbers 1 through 10; the
second grouping would go from 11 through 20. From there you can calculate
the groupings all the way up to the last grouping going from 91 through 100. I
know that the numbers you’ve collected don’t go down to 1 or up to 100, but
this way the intervals are all the same size, and they cover all the numbers
pretty symmetrically.
Ready for some practice in setting up a frequency distribution with groupings?
Great! Try this one out: Say that you’ve been keeping track of the number of
miles driven each week by your sales associates. You want to organize them in
a frequency distribution. What does your distribution table look like?
To begin, take a look at Table 8-2, which shows the mileage records of your
eight associates.

Looking through the list, you can see that the numbers range from a low of 55
miles to a high of 986 miles. The range is 932 miles (986 – 55 + 1), so your best
bet is to have 10 groupings starting with 0 to 99 and going up to 900 to 999.

This frequency table is much more informative than the original listing of
numbers in Table 8-2. In fact, this table is probably even more informative
(and easier to set up) than listing all the numbers in order from smallest to
largest or vice versa. Why? Well, for starters, the manager gets a feel for the
expected or more frequent mileage numbers. Also, the highest and lowest
numbers stand out more and may trigger some inquiries. Finally, the mileage
information helps in planning the salesperson’s time and reimbursement 
projections.
Finding the Average
When you read about the average income across the country, you probably
think in terms of a number that falls in the middle of the entire spectrum of
incomes. In general, that’s a correct thought — the average usually is the
middle or most used value. But, in fact, the average value can be determined
one of three ways. In other words, the “middle” average is just one way. The
average can be the mean, the median, or the mode.

Part II: Taking Intriguing Math to Work 

The purpose of having three different ways of measuring the average is to give
the best and most descriptive number for the average of a particular collection
of numbers. Unfortunately, having the three choices can lead to some abuse of
numbers and some misrepresentation of what’s in the collection. So, in the fol-
lowing sections, I show you all three methods of finding the average, and I let
you decide what works best for describing the average value in your situation.
Adding and dividing to find the mean
The mean average is the number determined by adding all the numbers in a
collection and dividing by the number of numbers that you’ve added together.
Want to see the actual formula? The mean average of the numbers a1, a2, a3, . . .
an is equal to the sum of the n numbers divided by n:

Find the mean average of these numbers: 8, 6, 4, 9, 2, 2, 5, 4, 7, 3, 9, 6.
To find the mean, add the numbers and divide by 12. You divide by 12
because you have 12 numbers in the list. Here’s what the math looks like:

The mean average, 5.417, isn’t on the list of numbers, but it somewhat
describes the middle of the collection.
Suppose a not-so-ethical factory owner objects to the bad press that he has
been receiving from his employees, who are complaining that his pay scale is
much too low. When interviewed, he expresses incredulity that his employ-
ees would complain. After all, the average salary for everyone at the factory
is $53,500. The nine employees who are complaining claim that they’re
making only $15,000. How can this be?
If the nine employees are each making $15,000, and if the average salary of
the nine employees and the owner is $53,500, you can easily find the owner’s
salary by solving for x, like this:

Chapter 8: Analyzing Data and Statistics

If the owner is taking home $400,000, the mean average salary of the ten
people is, in fact, $53,500. So the owner isn’t exactly lying, but he’s definitely
using a method that doesn’t paint a true picture. This is a case of the mean
average not really representing the true average or middle value. A better
measure of the average salary in this case is the median or the mode, which I
explain later in this chapter.
Locating the middle with the median
The median is the middle of a specifically ordered list of numbers (to remem-
ber this one, just think about a median that runs down the middle of the high-
way). The median as an average or middle of a set of numbers is a great
representation of the average when you have one or more outliers. An outlier
is a number that’s much smaller or much larger than all the other values.
For instance, you may remember in school when that one classmate always
scored 100 or 99 even when the rest of you struggled for a 70. Those curve-
breakers were so annoying. A curve-breaker is sort of like an outlier. The
higher-than-usual score hiked up the average for everyone. The median aver-
age is designed to lessen the effect of that unusual score.
The median is the middle number in an ordered (highest to lowest or lowest
to highest) list of numbers. If the list has an even number of entries (meaning
there is no middle term), the median is the mean average of the middle two
numbers. (Refer to the previous section if you need guidance on finding the
mean average.)
Find the median of the following numbers: 8, 6, 4, 9, 2, 2, 5, 4, 7, 3, 9, 6.
First put the numbers in order from least to greatest: 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8,
9, 9. Because the list has 12 numbers, the 6th and 7th numbers in the list are
in the middle. The two middle numbers are 5 and 6. So to find the median,
you have to find the mean average of 5 and 6. You do so by adding the num-
bers together and dividing by 2. You get 5.5 as the mean.
As it turns out, the mean average of the entire list is 5.417 (see the example in
the previous section), so the mean and median are pretty close in value in
this situation. Having two averages of the same list that are close together
in value gives you more assurance that you have a decent measure of the
middle.
The ages of the 15 employees at Methuselah Manufacturing are 18, 25, 37, 28,
23, 29, 31, 87, 20, 24, 30, 21, 22, 93, 19. Find both the mean and median ages
and determine which is a better representation of the average age.

The mean average is the sum of the ages divided by 15:

As you can see, the mean average age is 33.8, which is a higher number than
all but three of the actual ages.
Now find the median by putting the ages in order from lowest to highest:
18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 28, 29, 30, 31, 37, 87, 93
You have an odd number of values, so your middle age is the eighth number
in the list: 25. An average age of 25 (rather than 33.8 with the mean average)
better represents most of the actual ages. The two oldest employees are so
much older than the others that their ages skew the middle or average age.
Understanding how frequency 
affects the mode
The mode of a set of numbers is the most-frequently occurring number — it’s
the one that’s listed most often. The mode is a good average value when the
number occurs overwhelmingly frequently in the list. The following three
sets of numbers all have a mode of 5:
A) 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 10
B) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18
C) 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 999, 999
The mode of 5 in the first and third lists seems to make the most sense as rep-
resenting the average of the list. In the middle list, however, even though 5 is
technically the mode, it doesn’t seem to represent what the list of numbers
is. In this case, you might want to find the average another way.
Suppose you want to show that your nonprofit foundation is kid-friendly, but
you don’t want to reveal how many children are in specific families. Determine
which average is the best representation of the number of children of the
43 families served by your foundation: 0, 5, 6, 0, 3, 4, 0, 4, 10, 14, 7, 0, 6, 2, 3, 0,
4, 5, 4, 8, 7, 3, 5, 3, 2, 6, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 6, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 6, 1, 2.
First put the numbers in order. You must do this when finding the median,
but it’s also helpful to have an ordered list when figuring the mean and mode.
In order, the numbers are 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3,
3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 10, 14.
105
Chapter 8: Analyzing Data and Statistics

The mean is the sum of the numbers divided by 43. The sum is 158, and 
158 ÷ 43 ≈3.674.
The median is the middle number, which in this case is the 22nd number. So,
the median is 3.
The mode is the most frequent number, which after counting is 2 (there are
eight 2s).
So, which outcome —3.674, 3, or 2 — do you think is the best representation
of the list? The two outliers (10 and 14) pull the average up a bit. I’d probably
go with the middle (median) of the averages — but it’s really your call on
this. You can correctly say that any of the values is the average.
Factoring in Standard Deviation
The average of a listing of numbers tells you something about the numbers, but
another important bit of information is the variance or standard deviation —
how much the numbers in the listing deviate from the mean average (see the
earlier section, “Adding and dividing to find the mean,” for more on mean aver-
ages). The standard deviation is a measure of variation and can be a decent
comparison between two sets of numbers — as long as the numbers have
some relation to one another. After all, as with other facets of statistics, you
have to be careful not to misrepresent what’s going on just because you can.
Computing the standard deviation
Standard deviation is a measure of spread. This spread has to do with how far
most of the numbers are from the average. For example, you may be inter-
ested not only in the average number of sales of your staff members, but also
whether the sales cluster closely around that average or are much higher and
much lower than the average. Is your staff pretty predictable and steady, or
are they all over the place with their sales endeavors? Standard deviation is a
number representing the deviation from the mean. So the greater the stan-
dard deviation, the more numbers you’ll find that are farther from the mean
average.
To find the standard deviation of a list of numbers, use the following formula:

where Σx2 represents the sum of all the squares of the numbers in the list, n is
the number of numbers, and x represents the mean average of the numbers
(which is squared in the formula before multiplying it by n).
Each of the following three lists of numbers has a mean average of 5:
A) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
B) 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9
C) 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9
To find the standard deviation of list A, you square each number and then
add up all the squares. Because the number 5 repeats 15 times, I show that as
a multiple of 12:
12 + 22 + 32 + 42 + 15(52) + 62 + 72 + 82 + 92 = 635
You know that the mean average of the list is 5, and you know that there are
23 numbers in the list. Now all you have to do is substitute the numbers into
the formula:

Using the same process on lists B and C, you get standard deviations of about
2.132 for list B and exactly 4 for list C. So the first list of numbers has the
smallest deviation, and the last list of numbers has the greatest deviation.
At a local ice cream factory, the hourly wages of the employees are as follows:
4 employees earn $8.00 per hour
7 employees earn $8.50 per hour
20 employees earn $9.25 per hour
25 employees earn $10.00 per hour
4 employees earn $12.00 per hour
What’s the (mean) average wage of the employees, and what’s the standard
deviation?

This type of problem is solved more easily with a chart or table. So take a
look at Table 8-4, which I created for this scenario.

First, to compute the mean, you need to find the sum of the hourly rate of all
60 employees. Look at the sum of the third column, 574.5, where each rate
has been multiplied by the number of employees earning that rate. Divide
574.5 by 60 (the number of employees) and you get 9.575. The (mean) aver-
age hourly rate is about $9.58.
To compute the standard deviation, you need the sum of the squares of all
60 wage rates. The last column has the square of each rate multiplied by the
number of employees involved. The sum of the squares is 5,549. You have to
multiply the number of employees, 60, by the square of the mean. 9.5752 =
91.680625. Now you’re all set to put the numbers into the formula for the

N
othing is more common to different peoples’ inter-
est than the mathematics of finance. Whether you’re
earning interest compounded quarterly or paying off an
amortized loan, you’re involved with the intricacies of
interest, principals, and percentage rates. With the chap-
ters in this part, you can become better prepared to com-
pare the many different financial products out there. By
the end of this, you’ll be ready to stand as your own finan-
cial advocate. But it never hurts to get some professional
advice either.

nterest is basically a percentage of some amount of money. It’s either the
amount of money that you pay someone for the use of their money (such
as for a loan or credit card) or the amount that you’re paid for the use of your
money (such as with a savings account at a bank). The concept and practice
of determining interest has been around since ancient Babylonian mathemati-
cians created tables of numbers to determine how long it takes to double
one’s money at a particular interest rate.
Interest can be simple — as is the case with simple interest — but it can also
be complex — as with compound interest. (I explain each of these in this
chapter.) Extensive tables that provide numbers that you can use in calcula-
tions of interest are available, but the computations are so easily achieved
with a standard scientific calculator that you don’t need to tote tomes of
numbers around with you. In this chapter, you discover the hows and whys
of computing interest. You also see the effect of time and rate.
It’s best if you have a calculator at hand to confirm or deny the computations
of the example problems. However, even though the calculations aren’t diffi-
cult, you need to be careful when entering the entries into your calculator.
Why? What you type in may not be what you mean. For example, if you want
to raise a number to a fractional power, you need to put the fraction in paren-
theses. Typing 8^2/3 tells your calculator to raise 8 to the second power and

then divide by 3. If you really meant that you want to raise 8 to the 2⁄3 power,
you have to put the 2⁄3 in parentheses. Calculators use the order of operations
and perform powers before multiplication or subtraction (see Chapter 5 for
more on the order of operations).
Understanding the Basics of Interest
Interest is money. And if you’re the borrower, you pay for the privilege of
using the money. If you’re the lender, you’re paid the interest for your service
of providing the money. The amount of money being borrowed or loaned is
the principal, or the initial amount. The rate of interest is the percentage
of the principal that it costs to borrow the money (or that you’re paid for
using the money). And the time is the period — in years, months, or days —
that the transaction is taking place. Yes, I know, that’s a lot of terms to keep
straight, but they’re all important when it comes to understanding how to
compute interest.
Here are the two basic types of interest that you’re likely to come across:
 Simple interest: This type of interest is computed on the principal —
the amount borrowed — for the entire length of time of the transaction.
 Compound interest: This interest builds on itself. Money earned in inter-
est for part of the time period is reinvested and used in the computation
of interest for the rest of the time period.
I explain both of these types of interest later in the chapter.
Simply Delightful: Working 
with Simple Interest
Interest on money is the cost of buying things on credit. The fee you pay for
the privilege of using someone else’s money is the interest, and the amount
you get for lending someone money is also interest. The simplest computation
of interest is simple interest (now, isn’t that handy).
In this section, you see how simple interest works and how the different 
components, such as principal, rate, and time, interact with one another.
Note: Many of the properties of simple interest are closely related to those
of compound interest, so you see properties that are introduced here
repeated — with an interesting twist — in the sections on compound interest.
112
Part III: Discovering the Math of Finance and Investments 

Computing simple interest 
amounts the basic way
The formula for computing the amount of simple interest earned on a particu-
lar amount of money is
I = Prt
where P is the principal (the amount of money involved in the transaction),
r is the rate of interest (written as a decimal number), and t is the amount of
time (usually in years, if r is the yearly rate).
To compute, you simply fill in the numbers you have and solve for the miss-
ing ones. It can’t get much easier than that! (If you need guidance on decimal
equivalents, check out Chapter 2.)
Check out this example for practice: Suppose Jake borrows $4,000 for a new
piece of equipment. He borrows the money for 2 years at 11.5% interest. How
much does he pay in interest, and what’s the total amount he has to repay?
To solve this problem, simply plug your numbers into the formula (I = Prt),
like this: $4,000(11.5%)(2 years) = $4,000(0.115)(2) = $920. So Jake owes $920
in interest plus what he borrowed, which is $920 + $4,000 = $4,920.
Seeing how small businesses use simple interest
Simple interest is frequently used when small businesses act as lenders in
order to sell products. For instance, a local hardware store may sell you a
mechanized posthole digger and arrange for payments over the next two
years. In this situation, an interest rate is set and a time period is agreed on.
The amount loaned (plus the interest) is repaid periodically rather than at
the end of the time period.
Here’s an example that shows what I mean: Say that Delores purchases a new
bedroom set from a local furniture store. She makes arrangements with the
store to pay for the $3,995 bedroom set over the next 4 years at 12% interest
(simple interest). If she is to make equal monthly payments, how much are
those payments?
First determine the amount of interest that she’s paying by using I = Prt:
$3,995(0.12)(4) = $1,917.60. Add the interest to the cost of the bedroom set
to get the total amount: $3,995 + $1,917.60 = $5,912.60. Now divide the total
amount by 48 (4 years × 12 months per year) to get $5,912.60 ÷ 48 = $123.17916.
113
Chapter 9: Computing Simple and Compound Interest

The division doesn’t come out evenly, so Delores will pay $123.18 each month
for the first 47 months, and then she’ll pay $123.14 for her last payment. How
did I figure the last payment? Well, if you multiply $123.18 by 47, you get
$5,789.46 in payments. That leaves $5,912.60 – $5,789.46 = $123.14 for the 48th
payment. Sure, it’s only 4 cents, but Delores is a stickler for detail.
Solving for different values using the simple interest formula
The simple interest formula allows you to solve for more than just the amount
of interest accumulated. You also can use the formula to find the value of any of
the variables — if you have the other three. For instance, you can determine
the interest rate from the amount of interest paid. See how in the following
example.
Freddy agreed to make quarterly payments of $781.25 for 4 years on a loan of
$10,000. What simple interest rate is he paying?
You first need to determine the total amount of money being repaid. If Freddy
is making 4 payments a year for 4 years, you know that he’s making 16 pay-
ments of $781.25. So his total repayment is 16 × $781.25 = $12,500. You also
know that he borrowed $10,000, so the interest he’s paying is: $12,500 –
$10,000 = $2,500. The interest amount, $2,500, is the answer to the interest
formula, I = Prt. So replace the I with $2,500, replace P with $10,000, replace t
with 4, and then solve for r. Your math should look like this:
,

So, as you can see, Freddy is paying 6.25% interest on his loan.
Now try out this example, which asks you to use I = Prt to solve for the princi-
pal amount. Say Hank was helping out his aunt with her finances. Auntie Em
took out a loan for a new television set 2 years ago and agreed to pay $121.88
each month for 5 years at 121⁄2% interest. How much did the TV cost (before
interest is added in)?
The repayment amount is the principal (cost of the TV) plus the interest on
the loan. If she’s paying $121.88 per month, that’s 60 payments (5 years × 12
months). So the total she’ll pay back over the 5-year period is $121.88 × 60 =
$7,312.80.
The total, $7,312.80, represents the principal plus the interest (P + I = $7,312.80).
You replace the I in this equation with Prt (so you can solve for the cost of the
114
Part III: Discovering the Math of Finance and Investments 

TV), which gives you P + Prt = $7,312.80. Now factor out the P, fill in the interest
rate and time, and then solve for P, like so:

The principal comes out to be $4,500.18. That’s some jazzy TV set that
Auntie Em bought.
Stepping it up a notch: Computing 
it all with one formula
The formula for simple interest, I = Prt, gives you the amount of interest
earned (or to be paid) given an amount of money, an interest rate, and a
period of time. You want the amount of interest as a separate number when
you’re figuring your expenses or taxes as a part of doing business. But, as I
show in the previous section, you frequently want the total amount of money
available (or to be repaid) at the end of the time period. You add the principal
to the interest to get the total. But guess what? There’s a better way! Here’s a
formula that allows you to find the total amount all in one computation:
A = P(1 + rt)
where A is the total amount obtained from adding the principal to the inter-
est, P is the principal, r is the annual rate written as a decimal, and t is the
amount of time in years.
Try your hand at using this formula: Imagine that Casey loaned her business
partner $20,000 at 7% simple interest for 3 years. How much will Casey be
repaid by the end of the time period?
Using A = P(1 + rt), Casey gets A = $20,000(1 + 0.07 × 3) = $20,000(1.21) =
$24,200. From this total, you can determine the interest paid by subtracting
the principal amount from the total: $24,200 – $20,000 = $4,200.

Chapter 9: Computing Simple and Compound Interest

Taking time into account 
with simple interest
Loans don’t have to be for whole years. You can borrow money for part of a
year or for multiple years plus a fraction of a year. If the time period is half of a
year or a quarter of a year or a certain number of months, the computation is
pretty clear. You make a fraction of the time and use it in place of the t in I = Prt.
When you get into a number of days, however, the math can get pretty inter-
esting. For instance, when dealing with a number of days, the discussion then
involves ordinary or exact simple interest. I explain each of the scenarios in
the following sections.
Calculating simple interest for parts of years
The simple interest formula (which I explain earlier in the chapter) uses the
annual interest rate and t as the number of years. When you use a fraction of
a year, you essentially reduce the interest rate. For example, to compute the
interest on $1 for 1 year at 4% interest, your math looks like this: I = Prt =
$1(0.04)(1) = 0.04. Now, if you take that same $1 at 4% for half a year, you get
I = Prt = $1(0.04)(0.5) = 0.02.
It doesn’t matter whether you take half the interest rate or use half a year;
either way you get the same number. You just choose the one that makes the
computation easier.
Say Abigail is borrowing $6,000 for 3 months at 8% simple interest. How much
does she repay at the end of 3 months?
Using I = Prt, you let the time be 1⁄4 of a year (3 months ÷ 12 months = 1⁄4 ). So you
get I = $6,000(0.08)(0.25) = $120. In this case, I replaced the 1⁄4 with 0.25 to enter
the numbers in the calculator. I also could have taken advantage of the fact that
8% divides evenly by 4 and written I = $6,000(0.02) = $120. In any case, Abigail
owes $6,000 + $120 = $6,120 at the end of the 3-month loan period.
Try out another example that stirs things up a bit: Say that Gustav repaid a
loan in 30 months by making bimonthly payments of $880. How much did
Gustav borrow, if the simple interest rate was 4%?
Bimonthly means every other month, so a 30-month loan period has 15 pay-
ments. So you multiply the payment amount by the number of payments to
get the total payment amount: $880 × 15 = $13,200. The total of all the pay-
ments includes both interest and principal, so use this formula to solve for
the principal amount:
P(1 + rt) = total repaid
116
Part III: Discovering the Math of Finance and Investments 

I show you how to use this formula in the earlier section, “Computing simple
interest amounts the basic way.” There I also show you how the formula is
derived.
Solving for the principal, you let 30 months be 21⁄2 years, and then you plug in
all the numbers. Your math should look like this:

So you can see that Gustav borrowed $12,000 21⁄2 years ago.
Distinguishing between ordinary and exact simple interest
To liven things up a bit, here in this section I introduce two ways of looking at
computing interest: using ordinary simple interest and using exact simple
interest. You don’t need to be concerned about distinguishing between ordi-
nary and exact interest unless you’re dealing with small periods of time —
usually a number of days instead of a number of years.
When computing simple interest in terms of a number of years or parts of
years (half a year or a quarter of a year), you use whole numbers or fractions
in your calculations. Short-term transactions, on the other hand, may be mea-
sured in days. In that case, you have to decide whether to use ordinary or
exact interest. The difference between these two is that ordinary interest is
calculated based on a 360-day year, and exact interest uses exactly the number
of days in the year — either 365 or 366, depending on whether it’s a leap year.
(See the nearby sidebar, “Don’t forget about the leap years!” for more infor-
mation.) The following examples will help you understand how to use both
ordinary and exact interest.
What’s the difference between the ordinary interest and the exact interest on
a loan of $5,000 at 6% interest for 100 days if the year is 2008?
First, to compute ordinary interest, you divide the number of days by 360
(the number of days in an “ordinary” year), which gives you the fraction you
use for the amount of time in the formula. In this case, you divide100 by 360.
Now you plug all your numbers into I = Prt, like this, to get your answer:
$ ,

Chapter 9: Computing Simple and Compound Interest

Next, you compute the exact interest. To do so, you divide 100 by 366
(because 2008 is a leap year), and then you use that fraction for the amount
of time. Now fill in your formula:

The difference between the two interest methods is just over $1. The ordinary
interest number is more convenient, but the number 360 in the denominator
of the fraction does make the fraction value larger than with a denominator of
365 or 366. And the difference will become more significant as the amount bor-
rowed increases.
Exact interest also is used when the starting and ending dates of a loan are
given and you have to figure out the number of days involved. Most desk cal-
endars include numbers on each date indicating which day of the year it is.
For example, in the year 2007, November 4 was the 308th day of the year.
I include the year because in 2008, November 4 is the 309th day of the year
due to adding the leap year day.
Say, for example, that Timothy borrowed $10,000 on April 17 and paid it back,
with exact simple interest of 51⁄4%, on November 22 in the year 2007. What
interest was charged on the $10,000 loan?
First refer to a calendar and verify that April 17 was the 107th day in 2007 and
November 22 was the 326th day. Find out the total number of days of the loan
118
Part III: Discovering the Math of Finance and Investments 
Don’t forget about the leap years!
Leap year days were added to the calendar in
the 1700s when Pope Gregory determined that
our seasons weren’t jibing with the actual
weather. Our calendar had become out of sync
with the sun. As it turns out, the lack of coordi-
nation of the calendar with the seasons came
about because the Earth’s years are actually
3651⁄4 days long. The Pope’s new Gregorian cal-
endar added leap year days to fix this problem.
Here’s how to tell whether a year is a leap year:
If a year is evenly divisible by 4, the year is a
leap year and has 366 days instead of 365 (for
example, 2008 and 2012 are leap years, while
2009, 2010, and 2011 are not). The added day is
February 29. But because this addition causes
a bit of an error (the year isn’t quite 3651⁄4 days
long), another correction in the calendar is
applied to century years, such as 1700, 1800,
1900, 2000, 2100, and so on. A century year is a
leap year only if it’s divisible by 400. So the year
2000 was a leap year, but the year 2100 will not
be. (Hope you’re planning on sticking around to
remind the calendar makers of all this!)

by subtracting: 326 – 107 = 219 days. Now, using the simple interest formula
and 365 days, plug in your numbers:

Surveying some special rules 
for simple interest
Simple interest is relatively easy to compute, but leave it to some folks to
come up with shortcuts or rules to make the computation — or estimations
of the computation — even easier. The rules I’m referring to are the Banker’s
Rule, the 60-day 6% method, and the 90-day 4% method. I explain each in the
following sections.
The Banker’s Rule
The Banker’s Rule is a common method of computing interest that combines
ordinary interest and exact time. This definition seems a bit of a contradic-
tion, but here’s how it works: The ordinary interest rule of using 360 days is
applied, and the exact number of days is used. So instead of computing inter-
est on three months and calling it 1⁄4 of a year, you determine exactly how
many days are in those three months and divide by 360.
You may wonder just how different the figures might be when using the exact
days in three months versus 1⁄4 of a year. Consider some of the months in the
year 2007 in groups of three:
January through March: 31 + 28 + 31 = 90 days
February through April: 28 + 31 + 30 = 89 days
March through May: 31 + 30 + 31 = 92 days
The fractions formed by dividing the number of days by 360 are:

The decimal equivalents don’t seem to be too different, but when you multi-
ply these decimals by big numbers, the slight variations make a significant
difference!

Chapter 9: Computing Simple and Compound Interest

How about an example? Using the Banker’s Rule, what’s the interest on a loan
of $10,000 at 7% from April 1 to October 1?
Determine the number of days involved. You can use a calendar or table that
provides the number of each day and get 274 – 91 = 183 days. Or you can add
up the days in each month: 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 = 183. (Note: You don’t
count October 1st). Now, using the simple interest formula, calculate the
interest:

The 60-day 6% or 90-day 4% rules
The 60-day 6% and 90-day 4% rules are two shortcut estimations of interest.
These rules are great because both 60 and 90 divide 360 evenly and form nice
fractions when you divide them by 360. For instance, take a look:
360
60
6
1
360
90

and
=
=
When you couple the fractions formed by dividing 60 or 90 by 360 with inter-
est rates of 6% or 4% or 12%, you can do quick calculations of the interest (as
long as the combination of the fraction and the percentage comes out to be a
nice number).
For example, if you have a 60-day loan at 6%, you can multiply 1⁄6 × 6% = 1%.
A 90-day loan at 8% gives you 1⁄4 × 8% = 2%. The rest of the computations
involving multiplying fractions and interest rates work the same, and, hope-
fully, you can do them in your head.
As an example, use the 90-day 4% method to estimate the interest on a loan
of $25,000.
This one is so easy. First, multiplying 4% by 1⁄4 gives you 1%. Then multiplying
$25,000 by 0.01 gives you $250. Not too bad.
Looking into the future with present value
When you’re talking money, the expression present value describes itself
fairly well, but it’s also a bit confusing. Just remember this: What you’re really
looking forward to is having a certain amount of money in the future when
you talk about present value. In other words, if you have some goal for a par-
ticular amount of money in the future, you want to know how much money to
deposit now (in the present) so that the addition of simple interest will create
the sum of money that you need.
120
Part III: Discovering the Math of Finance and Investments 

For example, if you want $10,000 to buy a new piece of machinery 3 years
from now, do you invest $8,000, $9,000, or $9,500 today? When these amounts
of money earn interest, will the added interest bring you up to $10,000? Well,
you can’t really answer this question yet, because I haven’t given you any
interest rate. So this type of question will be a two-pronged one. One plan of
attack will be to determine how much money to deposit if you know the inter-
est rate, and the other approach will be to find an interest rate if you know
the amount of money available for deposit.
In general, you can solve for the principal needed or the rate needed (or even
the amount of time needed) after you know what your money goal is. The for-
mulas used in the computations are all derived from the basic A = P(1 + rt)
formula for the total amount of money resulting from simple interest. (You
can find more on this basic formula in the earlier section, “Stepping it up a
notch: Computing it all with one formula.”) Here are all the formulas that
you’ll use when dealing with present value:

where A is the total amount after adding simple interest, P is the principal,
r is the interest rate as a decimal, and t is the amount of time in years.
Now it’s time to try your hand at these formulas with a few examples.
Say that 3 years from now, you want to buy a new storage shed — and you
need to have $27,000 set aside at that time. You intend to deposit as much
money as is necessary right now so that when it earns simple interest at 53⁄4%
it will be worth $27,000 in 3 years. How much do you have to deposit?
You know the total amount needed, A, the interest rate, r, and the amount of
time, t. So, use the formula to solve for the principal needed:

Here’s the same problem with a twist: Three years from now, you want to buy
a new storage shed — and you need to have $27,000 set aside by that time.
You have $20,000 at hand, which means that you need to find someone who
will give you a high enough simple interest rate so that the $20,000 will grow
to $27,000 (by adding the interest) in 3 years’ time. What interest rate do you
need?

Getting to Know Compound Interest
The biggest difference between simple interest and compound interest is that
simple interest is computed on the original principal only (see the earlier sec-
tion, “Simply Delightful: Working with Simple Interest,” for details). In other
words, no matter how long the transaction lasts, the interest rate multiplies
only the initial principal amount.
Compound interest, on the other hand, multiplies the interest rate by the origi-
nal principal plus any interest that’s accumulated during the time period of
the transaction. As you can imagine, compound interest is pretty powerful.
After all, the principal keeps growing, making the interest amount increase as
time passes. The bigger interest amount is added to the principal to make the
interest amount even bigger.
Compound interest is the type of interest that financial institutions use. In
this case, your money grows exponentially, so exponents (those cute little
superscripted powers) are a part of the formula for determining how much
money you have as a result of compound interest. Of course, for compound
interest to have its full effect, you can’t remove the interest earned; com-
pound interest is based on the premise that you leave the money alone and
let it grow.
Figuring the amount of compound
interest you’ve earned
Computing the total amount of money that results from applying compound
interest takes a jazzy formula. Besides involving multiplication, addition, and
division, this formula also requires you to work with exponents (and who
but mathematicians like to do that?). The hardest parts of working with the
formula are entering the values correctly into the formula and performing
the operations in the right order.
122

The formula for computing compound interest is
A
P
nr

where A is the total amount of money accumulated (principal plus interest),
P is the principal (the amount invested), r is the rate of interest (written in
decimal form), n is the number of times each year that the compounding
occurs, and t is the number of years.
Some scientific and graphing calculators allow you to type the numbers into
the formula pretty much the same way you see them. But if you don’t have
a calculator with all the bells and whistles, you still can do this problem 
correctly — as long as you perform the steps of the equation in the correct
order. You need to apply the order of operations. (If you don’t know how the
order of operations works, refer to Chapter 5, where I discuss it in detail.)
For the compound interest formula, you need to perform the operations in
the following order:
1. Determine the value of the exponent by multiplying n × t (the number
of times compounded each year times the number of years).
2. Inside the parentheses, divide the interest rate, r, by the number of
compoundings each year, n.
3. Add 1 to the answer in Step 2.
4. Raise the result from Step 3 to the power that you got in Step 1.
5. Multiply your answer from Step 4 by the principal, P.
Put these steps to use in the following examples.
How much money has accumulated in an account that’s earning interest at
the rate of 4% compounded monthly if $10,000 was deposited 7 years ago?
Fill in the formula letting P = $10,000, r = 0.04, n = 12, and t = 7:

Now go through these steps (the order of operations) to find your answer:
1. Multiply 12 × 7 = 84.
This is the value of the exponent.
2. Divide 0.04 ÷ 12 = 0.0033333. . . .
Round this answer to five decimal places to get 0.00333.
123
Chapter 9: Computing Simple and Compound Interest

3. Add 1 to the answer in Step 2.
After adding, you get 1.00333.
4. Raise 1.00333 to the 84th power.
So 1.0033384 ≈1.32214.
5. Multiply 1.32214 × $10,000 = $13,221.40.
Now you have the total amount accumulated in 10 years.
Curious to know how this compares to investing the same amount of money for
the same amount of time at the same rate using simple interest? Well, use the
formula for the total amount, A = P(1 + rt), to find out. $10,000(1 + 0.04 × 7) =
$12,800. By using compound interest, you earn about $400 more than you
would have with simple interest.
Noting the difference between
effective and nominal rates
When you walk into a bank, you’re faced with an easel or other display that’s
covered with decimal numbers. You see the latest on rates for car loans and
home equity loans and the update on the effective interest rates for various

The power of compound interest
What if a member of Christopher Columbus’
crew went into the Bank of the West Indies in
1492 and deposited $1 with the agreement that
it would earn 3% interest compounded annu-
ally? And what if that crew member never
returned (maybe he was on the ship that sank)?
Now come back to the year 2007, and say that
you were contacted by the Bank of the West
Indies as the only living heir of this sailor. The
bank now wants to close out this “nuisance
account.” What if it was willing to give you the
money accumulated in this account for over 500
years — as long as you pay a $50 per year main-
tenance fee retroactively? Does this sound
like one of those spam e-mails that you’ve been
getting recently? Well, before hitting the delete
button, take a gander at what the numbers say.
A deposit of $1 earning interest at 3% com-
pounded annually for 515 years (computing this
to 2007) amounts to $4,084,799.30. Even if you
have to pay 515 years of maintenance fees at
$50 per year, that’s only $25,750 out of your $4
million. Of course, you’ll ask the bank to deduct
the maintenance fee and send you the differ-
ence. If they insist on having the maintenance
fee up front, it’s time to delete the message.
This situation just goes to show you the power of
compounding — how just one dollar can grow to
millions of dollars — in a mere 500 years.

products. So what’s this effective interest rate business? The effective interest
rate is what you actually get as a result of compounding.
The nominal rate is the named rate, or what you’d get without compounding.
For instance, you may read that the nominal rate is 4.5% applied to certain
deposits for 6 months. The effective interest rate is what you get as a result
of compounding that nominal rate.
To determine the effective rate of interest, use this formula:
nr
1
1
n
+
-
c
m
where r is the nominal interest rate (expressed as a decimal) and n is the
number of compounding periods in a year.
When doing the computation for the effective interest rate, be sure to use the
order of operations correctly. Otherwise your calculations will be off. Here
are the steps you need to follow:
1. Simplify the fraction inside the parentheses.
2. Add 1 to the result of Step 1.
3. Raise the sum from Step 2 to the power outside the parentheses.
4. Subtract 1 from the number you get in Step 3.
What’s the effective rate of 4.5% compounded quarterly?
Using the formula, the effective rate is computed like this:

So, while the nominal rate is 4.5%, the effective rate is about 4.5765%.
Just how much difference does using the effective interest rate (versus the
nominal rate) make? In other words, why is 4.5765% so much better than 4.5%?
It’s all in the degree of involvement — or, to be blunt, in how much money you
have. If you deposit $1,000 and use 4.5% interest, you’ll earn $1,000 × 0.045 =
$45 in a year. The same $1,000 at 4.5765% earns about $45.76; you get a whole
76 cents more in a year. But if you have $10 million to invest, the difference
between what’s earned at 4.5% and 4.5765% is $7,650 ($457,650 – $450,000 =
$7,650). Guess the saying “Money begets money” is true after all.

Chapter 9: Computing Simple and Compound Interest

Finding present value when 
interest is compounding
The present value of your money is what you deposit in your account today
in order to have a certain target amount in your account in the future.
Present value using simple interest is covered in the earlier section, “Looking
into the future with present value.” In this section, however, you get to use
the power of compounding to make the present value smaller — meaning
that you don’t have to commit as much money right now in order to get your
target amount later.
To find the present value, P, of an amount of money, A, in t years when the
money grows at r interest (expressed as a decimal) compounded n times
each year, use the following formula:
P
nr
A
1
nt
=
+
c
m
To use this formula, use this order of operations:
1. Find the value of the exponent nt by multiplying the number of times
you compound by the number of years.
2. Divide the rate, r, by n and add the result to 1.
3. Raise the sum (after adding the 1) to the nt power to get the value in
the denominator of the fraction.
4. Divide the amount of money, A, by the denominator.
Say, for example, that you want to have $400,000 in 5 years to purchase a new
piece of equipment. How much do you need to deposit today at 63⁄4% interest,
compounded monthly, so there’s $400,000 in your account when you need it?
To solve, you just need to plug your numbers into the formula for present
value, like so:

Determining How Variable Changes
Affect Money Accumulation
Many different banks are available these days, and there are just as many
options, offers, and arrangements that can be made with your money at the
different institutions. For instance, do you choose the free checking or the
unlimited account transfers? Decisions, decisions. I can’t help you in choos-
ing one bank over another, but I can show you just how much the interest
rate, the number of compoundings, or the time invested actually affect the
end result. The rest is for you to sort through and decide.
As you may know from reading this chapter, the compound interest formula
has four different variables, or things that can change. The variables are
 P, the principal or amount of money invested
 r, the interest rate, entered as a decimal
 n, the number of times each year that the interest is compounded
 t, the time in number of years
If you adjust any of the four variables, you change the output or end result.
In general, increasing any of the variable numbers increases the output. But
how much is the increase, and which variable has the greatest impact on an
increase? I show you in the following sections.
Comparing rate increases to
increased compounding
Say that you have $10,000 and need to determine where to invest that money
to earn the greatest amount of interest. If you invest your money at 4% inter-
est, compounded annually, you’d have $10,000(1 + 0.04) = $10,400 at the end
of one year. (Refer to the earlier section, “Getting to Know Compound Interest,”
for the details on how to do this computation.) Knowing that, your next ques-
tion is this: Will you do better to invest your $10,000 with an institution that
increases the interest rate by one-quarter of a percent, or should you stick with
the same interest rate and go someplace that compounds interest quarterly?
To answer this question, you need to determine the total amount of money
in an account if $10,000 is deposited for 1 year at 41⁄4% compounded annually.
Then you simply compare that total amount with the result of $10,000 being
127

deposited in an account that earns interest at 4% compounded quarterly.
Here’s what the computations look like:

Clearly, the increase in the interest rate has the greater impact on the total
amount after a year. A 1⁄4% increase may not be realistic, however. In banking
circles, a quarter of a percent is big money.
Imagine that the total amount in an account where a deposit of $10,000 is
earning 4% interest compounded quarterly is $10,406.04 at the end of 1 year.
What are the effects of increasing the interest rate by one-hundredth of a per-
cent at a time and applying annual compounding?
The following list shows the end results of interest rates of 4.01%, 4.02%, and
so on, with annual compounding:
A = $10,000(1 + 0.0401)1(1) = $10,401
A = $10,000(1 + 0.0402)1(1) = $10,402
A = $10,000(1 + 0.0403)1(1) = $10,403
A = $10,000(1 + 0.0404)1(1) = $10,404
A = $10,000(1 + 0.0405)1(1) = $10,405
A = $10,000(1 + 0.0406)1(1) = $10,406
It only takes a six-hundredths of a percent increase in the interest rate for the
end result to equal the effect of compounding quarterly instead of annually.
Comparing rate increases 
to increases in time
Maybe you’re stuck with one type of interest compounding. For instance,
maybe you only deal with institutions that compound quarterly. Now you
want to compare the effect of increasing the interest rate with the effect of
increasing the amount of time you leave the money in the account. If you
have your money invested at 4% compounded quarterly, would you be better
off increasing the rate of interest to 41⁄4% or leaving it in the original account
for an extra quarter of a year?

Chapter 9: Computing Simple and Compound Interest

The problems involving comparing interest rates and compounding and time
show you that many variations are available when investing your money or
borrowing money. Find some interest charts and look to see how much your
money earns at each rate and amount of time. Sometimes, though, it’s more
a matter of convenience and service (rather than a few extra dollars here and
there) that draws you to a particular institution — and that’s okay.

Chapter 10
Investing in the Future
In This Chapter
 Investing with a lump sum
 Dealing with annuity calculations
 Understanding annuity payouts
You earn money in many ways. First and foremost, you work hard at your
job. And maybe you also buy and manage apartment buildings, buy
stocks or bonds, or invest your money with some financial institution where
you have the understanding that the institution will put your money to work
to earn interest or dividends.
This chapter deals with the different opportunities available for investing
your money. For instance, you can deposit a lump sum and let it grow by
compounding. Or you can deposit that same lump sum and withdraw regular
amounts until it’s all gone. You may even opt to make regular deposits of
money and allow them to grow over the years. The choices (and variations
on the choices) are many.
When investing money, many folks use annuities. And sinking funds are often a
form of annuity. The present value and future value of annuities translate into
the various uses for annuities. In this chapter, by covering some examples,
emphasizing the financial-speak vocabulary, and showing you the step-by-step
process of the mathematics of investing, I show you how to take more control
of your financial plans.

Calculating Investments
Made with Lump Sums
Businesses are created with the ultimate goal of making a profit. And profit
occurs when the revenue is greater than the cost. When a business produces
items to sell, revenue is generated by that sale. But businesses have other
options for creating revenue, in the form of investments of capital. When situ-
ations arise and a business can take advantage of the opportunity to make
a greater profit through an investment, a firm understanding of the math
involved is a must.
Your investment opportunities are abundant, so care must be taken to ensure
a safe investment as well as the best return possible. To determine the return
or interest on deposited money, you can use either of the following methods:
 A formula and a calculator: This method has the advantage of compact-
ness and flexibility.
 A table (and, frequently, a calculator): A table of values has the advan-
tage of quick review of the results of different rates.
Using a formula and calculator is okay, but for the purposes of this chapter, I
show you how to calculate investment info for a lump sum using the tables —
mostly because I’ve found them to be the quickest and easiest route.
Reading interest earnings from a table
Investments earn interest based on four elements:
 The total amount of money invested
 The rate of interest
 The number of times the interest is compounded per year
 The number of years the money is invested
The interest rate and number of times an amount is compounded are closely
related. How so? Well, you divide the annual interest rate by the number of
times it’s compounded each year. (Refer to Chapter 9 and the later sections
in this chapter for more on how interest is computed.)
132
Part III: Discovering the Math of Finance and Investments 

One way to simplify all the possible variations of interest rates and the
number of times the interest is compounded each year is to use a periodic
interest rate in your computations. A periodic interest rate is what the per-
centage is for that short period of time; you divide the yearly rate by the part
of the year being considered. For example, if the yearly interest rate is 8%,
and the interest is compounded quarterly, you want the rate for one-fourth
of a year; use this calculation each period: 8% ÷ 4 = 2% per time period.
You can obtain a particular periodic interest rate in several different ways —
dividing a yearly rate by a carefully selected number.
For instance, to have a periodic interest rate of 1% per period
1% per month comes from a 12% annual rate.
1% per quarter comes from a 4% annual rate.
1% per half-year (semiannual) comes from a 2% annual rate.
To have a periodic interest rate of 1.5% per period
1.5% per month comes from an 18% annual rate.
1.5% per quarter comes from a 6% annual rate.
1.5% per half-year (semiannual) comes from a 3% annual rate.
Using a table to determine the future value of an investment
Table 10-1 is a table that you can use to quickly determine the future value of
your investment. The table is relatively limited, however. You need a com-
plete book of compound interest tables if you intend to compute values of
your investments using tables. In the meantime, follow my instructions and
give the table a try; you may find that you like using interest tables.
To determine the future value of an investment from a table, multiply the
amount of your investment by the entry corresponding to the number of peri-
ods at which the investment has been compounded at the particular interest
rate per period.
Table 10-1 lists several interest rates and the number of periods that $1 is
subject to compounding. You intend to invest more than $1? I hope so! Just
multiply your investment amount by the corresponding value from the table.

Here’s an example to help you understand how to determine the future value
of an investment using Table 10-1: Say that you invest $40,000 for 10 years at
6% annual interest compounded quarterly. How much is your money worth at
the end of the 10 years?
After only a first glance, you may be wondering how you can use Table 10-1 to
determine the amount of your investment. After all, 10 doesn’t appear as a
period number, and 6% doesn’t appear as an interest rate. But that was just
your first glance. Take another look and note that you can count how many
times interest is compounded in 10 years if it’s compounded quarterly. You
simply multiply 10 years × 4 quarters = 40 compounding periods.
The rate of 6% annually becomes 6% ÷ 4 = 1.5% each quarter. So, in Table 10-1,
reading across the row for 40 periods and down the 1.5% column, you find
the number 1.814018. Now multiply your money like this: $40,000 × 1.814018 =
$72,560.72. Your investment hasn’t quite doubled in that 10 years. That wasn’t
so difficult, was it?
Interpolating for investment value
Most compound interest tables are more complete than the example table
that you find in Table 10-1. This sample is just a small excerpt of what usually
are pages and pages of entries. Nonetheless, Table 10-1 still shows you how
to use one of these tables. And now, with the same table, I want to show you
how to find values that lie in between two rows or two columns (by the way,
this type of estimation involving averaging is called interpolation).
134
Part III: Discovering the Math of Finance and Investments 

For instance, you may want to use the table to find the value of an investment
at the end of, say, 30 periods. To do so, you need to use the entries for 28
periods and 32 periods and find the halfway point. To find the halfway point,
just average the two values (add them together and divide by 2).
What’s the value of an investment of $100,000 after 2.5 years if it’s earning
12% annual interest compounded monthly?
First you have to determine how many periods 2.5 years of monthly com-
pounding means. Here’s what your equation would look like: 2.5 × 12 = 30
periods. An annual interest rate of 12% divided by 12 is 1% per period.
So, in Table 10-1, look down the first column to the entries for 28 periods and
32 periods. Now you have to average these entries. To do so, first add the
entries together. 1.321291 + 1.374941 = 2.696232. Divide that sum by 2, and
the average of the two numbers is 1.348116.
Now all you have to do is multiply the amount of your investment by the
average you just figured to get the value of your investment after 21⁄2 years:
$100,000 × 1.348116 = $134,811.60.
Taking advantage of tables to determine growth time
Tables of interest rates for compound interest are most useful for determin-
ing future values of an investment. But you also can use these tables to deter-
mine how long it would take a lump sum investment to grow to a particular
level.
Take another look at Table 10-1, and you see that the numbers in the rows
and columns are all bigger than 1. The entry 1.429503 represents a resulting
amount of money that’s about 1.4 times as much as what you started with.
So, if you invested $100, you have $100 × 1.4, or about $140. Now you’re prob-
ably looking at the numbers starting with 2. That’s where I look, too; after all,
doubling my money sounds rather attractive.
The key to using a table to determine the amount of time needed to create a
particular amount of money is to pick the multiplier that represents how
much money you want. Then you work backward to determine interest rates.
Say you have $1,000,000 and decide to invest it until it earns $500,000 in inter-
est. You’re in a hurry, so you find an investment opportunity that promises an
annual return of 18% compounded monthly. How long will you have to leave
your money invested at this high (and scary) rate in order for it to earn what
you need?
135
Chapter 10: Investing in the Future

You can solve this problem using Table 10-1. Well, you can get a pretty good
estimate anyway. First, add the principal to the interest to get a total amount
in the account: $1,000,000 + $500,000 = $1,500,000. Then divide that total by
the initial amount: $1,500,000 ÷ $1,000,000 = 1.5. So this means that you want
every $1 invested to grow to $1.50.
To determine which column in Table 10-1 contains the 1.5 that you want,
you need the interest rate. A rate of 18% annually when divided by 12 for the
monthly compounding gives you 18% ÷ 12 = 1.5%.
Use the 1.5% column and read down until you find the number closest to 1.5.
The row for 28 periods has the number 1.517222. That’s pretty close to 1.5. So
you’d have to have your money invested for about 28 periods. If each period
is one month, you can figure out the amount of time that is by dividing the
number of periods by 12, which would give you about 2 years and 4 months.
You can get a more exact answer by either interpolating (which I discuss in
the previous section) or using the formula for compound interest. In the
upcoming section, “Doubling your money, doubling your fun,” I show you
how to use the formula to solve for a time period.
Doubling your money, doubling your fun
How long does it take to double your money? Well, that depends. If you have
your money invested in an institution that pays 100% interest, compounded
annually, your money doubles in one year. Okay, 100% interest that’s com-
pounded annually isn’t reasonable — unless you have some interesting 
connections.
Instead, how about 10% compounded quarterly? Look at Table 10-1. Under
the 2.5% interest rate column (10% compounded quarterly is 10% ÷ 4 = 2.5%
each period) you find the entry 1.996495 opposite 28 periods. The number
1.996495 is pretty close to 2, so a good estimate of the amount of time needed
is 7 years (because 28 periods ÷ 4 = 7).
You may have noticed that I carefully chose my examples for doubling using
the table. One other entry is pretty close to 2. For instance, 2% interest with
36 periods also gives you twice your investment. But 2% interest might be 8%
compounded quarterly or 12% compounded bimonthly or 24% compounded
monthly. In other words, you can find many scenarios that accomplish the
doubling. Likewise, with 2.5% and 28 periods, you could be considering 5%
compounded biannually or 15% compounded every other month. Table 10-2
shows you how many years it takes to double your money, using the conve-
nient 2% and 2.5% interest rates.
136
Part III: Discovering the Math of Finance and Investments 

Of course, the higher the interest rate, the less time it takes for the invest-
ment to double. But another consideration in the computation is the number
of times each year that the interest is compounded. The first four lines of
Table 10-2 show you situations where it takes a total of 36 periods to double
the money. The last four lines of the table show you how it can take only 28
periods.

Using a table is a fine way to determine how long it takes for your money
to double, but there are other ways that are also fabulous. The following 
sections explain these methods.

You can use the following formula for finding the time it takes to double your
investment:

where n is the number of periods needed and i is the interest rate per period.
This formula for doubling your investment is used for doubling and doubling
alone. Just be careful when using the quick, slick formula that you’ve entered
the correct value for i.
137
Chapter 10: Investing in the Future

Using the slick formula that I just introduced, figure the following example:
How long does it take to double your money if you can invest at 4.5% com-
pounded monthly?
To begin, obtain the interest rate per period by dividing the interest rate by 12.
4.5% ÷ 12 = 0.375% = 0.00375. After that, plug 0.00375 into the formula, which
gives you:

Because n is the number of periods, you divide the interest rate per period
by 12 to get 185.1856 ÷ 12 ≈15.4321. So, as you can see, it will take almost 151⁄2
years to double the value at this interest rate.
Working with the Rule of 72
The Rule of 72 is a quick and fairly accurate method of determining how long
it takes to double your money at a particular interest rate. You don’t get
exact answers, but that’s okay because once you’re armed with an approxi-
mation, you can then decide if you want to pursue the issue further by haul-
ing out your tables or calculator.
Here’s how the Rule of 72 works: If you simply divide 72 by the annual inter-
est rate, you’ll get an estimate on how long it will take to double your money.
Check out these examples:
72 ÷ 7.2% ≈10 years to double your money
72 ÷ 10% ≈7.2 years to double your money
72 ÷ 6% ≈12 years to double your money
72 ÷ 9% ≈8 years to double your money
One reason that this method is so popular is that it allows you to do quick
calculations in your head. The number 72 is evenly divisible by so many num-
bers that you can either use exactly the interest rate you have in mind or you
can do an estimate of an estimate by averaging for rates in between.
For instance, the Rule of 72 says that it takes 12 years to double your money
at 6% interest and 9 years to double your money at 8% interest, so you can
guess that it will take between 9 and 12 years to double your money at 7%
interest.
You can also use the Rule of 72 to determine your rate of return when your
money doubles. If you invested $4,000 8 years ago and now have $8,000,
simply divide 72 by 8 and you see that the rate of return was 9%.
138
Part III: Discovering the Math of Finance and Investments 

Going the Annuity Route
Sometimes you don’t want to invest a lump sum all at once (see the earlier
section, “Calculating Investments Made with Lump Sums,” if you do). In that
case, you might choose to invest with an annuity. An annuity is a series of
equal payments made at equal periods of time. You may, for example, sign up
to contribute to an annuity in which you deposit $400 each month for the
next 10 years. With annuities, your deposits or contributions earn interest,
with the first payment or deposit earning interest the longest. And each pay-
ment’s interest earns interest — it’s a compounding of a piece at a time.
For example, if you deposit your $400 each month in an account earning 6%
interest compounded monthly, each month the interest is 6% ÷ 12 = 0.5%,
which is 0.005 in decimal form. The following shows the first few payments
and how each payment grows due to compound interest:
Month 1: $400
Month 2: $400 + $400(1 + 0.005)
Month 3: $400 + $400(1 + 0.005) + $400(1 + 0.005)2
Month 4: $400 + $400(1 + 0.005) + $400(1 + 0.005)2 +$400(1 + 0.005)3
Each month has a new deposit of $400 that hasn’t started to earn interest yet.
The $400 that was deposited the month before is worth 1.005 times as much
as it was when deposited. After two months, a deposit of $400 is worth
(1.005)2, or 1.010025, times it was when deposited (and so on through the
years). As you might imagine, the longer a deposit earns interest, the more
it’s worth. I explain everything you need to know about annuities in the fol-
lowing sections.
Some annuities are ordinary annuities and others are referred to as annuities
due. The main difference between the two types is when the payment is
made. In the case of an ordinary annuity, the payments are made at the end
of each period. With an annuity due, the payment is made at the beginning of
each period.
Preparing your financial future 
with a sinking fund
A sinking fund is a fund that’s set up to receive periodic payments with a par-
ticular goal in mind. For instance, you may set up a sinking fund to pay off a
note, or even better, to finance the purchase of some large piece of equipment
10 years from now. Why 10 years from now? Well, you know that the current
139
Chapter 10: Investing in the Future

equipment will need to be replaced, so you figure out how much you’ll have to
spend to replace it, and then you start saving toward that purchase.
With a sinking fund, you’re making regular payments, and the payments
you’re making are earning interest; so in reality you’re setting up an annuity.
Remember that you have an ordinary annuity if you’re making payments at
the end of each payment period and an annuity due if you’re making pay-
ments at the beginning.
Sinking funds were used in 14th-century Italy and in 18th-century Great
Britain in order to reduce the national debt. Perhaps the sinking expression
came in because the countries decided to retire the debt or go under?
Here’s an example you can work that deals with setting up a sinking fund:
Imagine that you have a piece of equipment that’s expected to last for
another 5 years. You set up a sinking fund in anticipation of having to pur-
chase a new piece of equipment to replace the current one that will be out-
dated. At the end of each of the next 5 years, you deposit $20,000 in the
sinking fund that earns 4.5% compounded quarterly. After those 5 years,
how much will you have in that fund to help you purchase the replacement
equipment?
What’s described here is an ordinary annuity in which the payments and the
compounding don’t coincide. So now you know you have to set up a sinking
fund and use the following formula to determine the future value:

All you have to do is plug the numbers you know into the equation. The regu-
lar deposits, R, are $20,000. The interest rate per compounding period is 4.5%
divided by 4, which is 1.125%, or 0.01125. The number of times the interest is
compounded each year is n = 4, and that compounding goes on for t = 5
years. The number of payments per year is p = 1. So with everything plugged
in, the future value is

Part III: Discovering the Math of Finance and Investments 

Determining the payment amount
With a sinking fund (which is described in the previous section), you con-
tribute a regular amount of money each time period and accumulate a sum to
be used some time in the future. But what if you need a particular amount of
money? What if you have a specific goal in mind for a particular project? In
that situation, you want to determine how much has to be contributed now,
in regular payments, in order to have a specific amount of money accumu-
lated then.
The amount of the regular payment needed to accumulate A dollars in an
ordinary annuity is found with this equation:
R
i
Ai
1

n
=
+
-
^
h
where R is the payment amount, i is the interest per pay period, and n is the
number of periods over which the amount will accumulate.
Wrap your brain around this equation by trying out this example: Suppose
you want to accumulate $450,000 over the next 6 years in order to buy a new
building for your business. You plan to make monthly payments into an ordi-
nary annuity that earns 4.5% compounded monthly. What do your payments
need to be?
The interest per pay period is the annual rate of 4.5% divided by 12, which
gives you 0.375%, or 0.00375, per period. Monthly payments for 6 years add
up to 72 payments (12 × 6 = 72). By substituting these numbers into the for-
mula, you get this math:

So this means that you need to make monthly payments of about $5,456.
Multiplying the payment amount by the 72 months, you get a total contribu-
tion of about $392,832. Add to this the almost $60,000 in interest, and you
have what you need for the new building.
Finding the present value of an annuity
The present value of an annuity is the amount of money that you would have
to deposit today (in one lump-sum payment) in order to accumulate the same
amount of money produced by contributing regularly to the annuity over
some particular period of time. These types of annuities are referred to as
141
Chapter 10: Investing in the Future

single-payment annuities. In practice, some people prefer them. After all, if
you could make one big payment today, you’d be all done with the payments.
But coming up with a huge lump sum of money isn’t always possible.
In this section, I compare two different ways of accumulating a particular
amount of money: one way is with a lump sum payment (that you have to
determine), and the other is with regular payments made to an annuity. You
get to decide whether to make the lump sum payment today and let it earn
interest over a certain number of years or to make regular payments into an
annuity for that same number of years.
The present value of an ordinary annuity is found with this equation:

where P is the principal (lump sum) or present value needed to be invested
at this time, R is the amount that would have to be contributed regularly with
the annuity, i is the periodic interest amount, and n is the number of periods
for which regular payments will be made.
Go over this example for some practice: What’s the present value of an ordi-
nary annuity earning 4% compounded quarterly if payments of $500 are made
every 3 months (quarterly) for 10 years?
First you have to find out how many payments you’ll pay in 10 years. To do so,
multiply the number of years by the number of payments per year: 10 × 4 = 40
payments. If you divide the interest rate by 4, the rate per quarter is 1%. Using
the formula, you get

into the account. The following two formulas show you the figures.

The amounts are off by a few cents, which is due to rounding, of course. (If
you need a refresher on computing compound interest, refer to Chapter 9.)
Computing the Payout from an Annuity
As I mention earlier in this chapter, an annuity is set up to collect money and
allow that money to earn interest over some period of time. Annuities allow
people to make donations to organizations; regular payouts are made as
donations over many years — or forever. Scholarships and business-starting
grants are often funded with annuities.
143
Chapter 10: Investing in the Future
The easy way to sum up a series
Formulas used to find the total amount in an
account after a number of years are based on
the sum of a series of numbers. A series in
mathematics is the sum of a list of numbers that
are different from one another by some con-
stant number or by some ratio. For instance, the
sequence of numbers: 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16 . . . is an
arithmetic sequence with the subsequent num-
bers found by adding 3 to the previous one. The
sequence of numbers: 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243 . . . is a
geometric sequence in which you multiply by 3
to get the next number in the sequence. Both
types of sequences have formulas that give you
the sum of the numbers you want to add. These
formulas are handy because who wants to have
to compute 1 + 4 + 7 + 10 + . . . + 3001 by hand (or
even with a calculator!)?
To find the sum of the first n terms of an arith-
metic sequence, use this equation:
S
n a
a
2
n
n
1
=
+
7
A
where a 1 represents the first term in the
sequence, and a n is the nth term.
You can find the sum of the first n terms of a
geometric sequence with this equation:
S
a
r
r
1
1
n
n

=
-
-
<
F
where r is the ratio or multiplier getting you from
one term to the next.
So if you want to add up the first 20 terms in the
sequence 1, 4, 7, 10, 13 . . . 58, you use the formula:

When you have an annuity, you can start the payout program as soon as the
money is deposited, or you can defer the payments for a number of years,
allowing the initial deposit to grow even more and the account to increase
in size. You can even set up an annuity with payments in perpetuity, meaning
that they pay out forever; as long as only the interest is paid out, the annuity
can keep providing money.
The payouts of an annuity are just the reversal of the payment into an annu-
ity. In the earlier section, “Finding the present value of an annuity,” you see
how a lump sum can be equal to making regular payments. In fact, depositing
a certain amount of money can accumulate as much in an account as paying
in over a number of years. The payout of an annuity is like taking that lump
sum and parceling it out in regular, periodic payments, until it’s gone. The
diminishing amount in the account still earns interest, but the amount of
growth of the account gets smaller and smaller over time.
Receiving money from day one
If you make a lump sum contribution into an annuity, and if you want to with-
draw regular amounts of money from the annuity, how much can you take out,
and how long will the money last? Both of these questions are dependent on
each other, and both are dependent on how much money is in the account.
But one thing is obvious: The less you take out each time, the longer the
money will last. Be frugal, my friend!
Figuring out the amount of upfront money that’s needed
When an endowment (a type of annuity) is made, the benefactor often has a
goal in mind — an amount of money that he or she would like to see given
each year for a certain number of years. With that goal in mind, the benefac-
tor then determines how much to invest or deposit so that the desired alloca-
tions can be made.
Consider this example: Imagine that an entrepreneur wants to give an endow-
ment to a small business catalyst to help local fledgling businesses get a good
start. The arrangement says that the entrepreneur will give $5,000 quarterly
to young businesses over the next 5 years. The endowment is invested in an
account earning 5% compounded quarterly. Upfront, how much did the entre-
preneur have to put into the account?
The present value of 20 payments of $5,000 earning interest at 1.25% per
quarter (5% ÷ 4 = 1.25%) is found with the formula for the present value of an
ordinary annuity (see the earlier section, “Finding the present value of an
annuity,” for more on this formula):

It looks like the benefactor gave approximately $88,000 to help the new 
businesses.
Discovering how much time the annuity will last
If you deposit a lump sum into an annuity, regular amounts can be withdrawn
from the account over a period of time until the money is gone. So you’ll
likely want to figure out how long that annuity will last based on your 
withdrawals.
Say, for example, that Hank gets a large insurance settlement and deposits it
in an account earning 6% compounded monthly. He arranges for monthly
payments of $5,000 to be made from that annuity to help offset his business
expenses. If the insurance settlement was for $400,000, how long will he be
able to get the monthly payments?
Using the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity, you can solve
for the number of payments, n. The interest rate per month is 6% ÷ 12 = 0.5%,
which is 0.005. The regular payments, R, are the amounts being paid to Hank
each month. Here’s what your equation should look like:

Are some of these steps a bit unfamiliar to you? If it has been a while since
you’ve seen an algebraic solution like this, refer to “Doubling your money,
doubling your fun,” earlier in this chapter, where you can see a similar
process used to solve an equation.
The value of n, the number of monthly payments, is about 102.42. Divide that
amount by 12 months, and you see that Hank will receive about 8.5 years of
monthly payments of $5,000 from his insurance settlement. $5,000 × 102.42 =
$512,100, which is the total amount of money that Hank will receive during
those 8.5 years. The settlement was for $400,000; the difference between
$512,100 and $400,000 is $112,100. So about $112,100 of that total is interest.
Deferring the annuity payment
You can deposit an amount of money into an account with the understanding
that regular payments will be made, but only after several years. You may
have deposited the money in the account all at once, or you may have accu-
mulated it over a period of years as an annuity. In any case, the amount in
the account grows with compound interest before being disbursed. To figure
the present value of a deferred annuity, you need to determine the number
of payment periods in the payout and the number of payment periods the
payout will be deferred before starting the disbursement.
The present value of a deferred annuity is found with this equation:

where R is the regular payout amount, i is the interest per period, n1 is the
number of periods the annuity is deferred, and n2 is the number of periods
that payments are to be made from the annuity.
The formula for deferred payments combines two other formulas: the present
value of an ordinary annuity (to determine the amount of money needed at
the beginning of the disbursement period) and the present value of that pre-
sent value (to determine how much you need to deposit right now to have
the required amount some time in the future).

Check out this example: A trust fund is set up to pay for the college educa-
tion of a 2-year-old boy. With the arrangement, $60,000 will be paid to the stu-
dent per year for 5 years, starting when he’s 18 years old. The fund earns
5.5% compounded quarterly. The payout will also be quarterly. What’s the
present value of this fund?
The quarterly payout amounts are $60,000 ÷ 4 = $15,000. The interest rate per
quarter is 5.5% ÷ 4 = 1.375%, which is 0.01375 in decimal form. The number of
periods that the annuity is deferred is 16 × 4 = 64, and the number of periods
over which the payment will be made is 5 × 4 = 20. Putting all the numbers in
their proper places, you get this equation:

O
ne of the first things you hear on the evening news is how the stock
market has behaved (or misbehaved) during the day. The ups and
downs of the market seem to act as a barometer of how the country and the
world are doing — on all fronts. And it doesn’t seem to take much to instigate
a change in the market. When change happens, people become either sellers
or bargain-seekers.
You may need to understand the basics of investing so you can answer ques-
tions from investors, help employees sort through investment choices, know
how the competition is doing, and manage your own stocks. You want to
understand the basic premises of stocks and bonds and be able to make the
computations necessary to further your understanding.
The daily price quotations in the newspaper and scrolling across your televi-
sion screen are interesting — but only with the right perspective. And the
stock averages at day’s end serve to summarize the day’s trading — but even
those numbers need a little explanation.
So, in this chapter, I show you how to compute and understand some earn-
ings ratios and daily quotes and determine the percent change from the day’s
activities. Bonds are a way of investing in a company, too, so I take a brief
look at the earnings involved with this investment tool.

Interpreting the Daily Stock Market
Quotations
Current technology allows for instantaneous information on all sorts of
investment topics: the price of various stocks, the number of shares that
have traded, and the performance of the different stock indexes. These
indexes include the Dow Jones Industrials, NYSE Composite, NASDAQ, S&P
500, and others. Choose the average that makes you happiest — at that par-
ticular point in time. Blink and it’s changed, anyway.
Getting to know the stock quotations
The daily price quotations for stocks appearing in the newspapers and on
television are much easier to decipher than they used to be. Until the
Common Cents Stock Pricing Act was passed in 1997, the prices used to be
in dollars and fractions, with halves, quarters, eighths, and sometimes even
sixteenths and thirty-seconds. Beginning in August 2000, the stock market
began changing the prices to decimals until all of the stocks and markets
were converted.
Converting these fractions to pennies when the decimal value of the fraction
had more than two places was especially difficult. For example, the fraction 
1⁄8 is equal to 0.125, which is 121⁄2 cents. I don’t know about you, but I can’t
recall seeing many half-penny coins around in my time. Luckily, the new,
enlightened quotation method uses pennies instead of fractions of dollars.
Table 11-1 is set up something like the daily stock quotations that you see in
the newspaper.

Chapter 11: Understanding and Managing Investments
Counting on stocks with different indexes
Even though the Dow Jones Industrial Average
(DJIA) and Standard & Poor’s 500 are the most
recognizable stock indexes, several other
indexes are used, observed, and studied. The
NASDAQ index, for example, includes many
smaller companies. Russell 2000 and Wilshire
5000 include smaller companies as well. The
2000 and 5000 in the names tell you the number
of companies included in the index. These big
numbers are a far cry from the 30 companies
measured by the DJIA. Some other indexes are
the NYSE Composite, Amex Market Value, S&P
MidCap, Dow Transportation, and the Dow
Utility Index. Just as the last two names imply,
they include transportation companies and util-
ity companies, respectively. Even though it isn’t
as well-known, the Transportation Index is
looked at with great interest, because when it’s
doing well, you know that goods are being
transported. And that, of course, is great for the
economy. Conversely, when the Transportation
Index is doing poorly, goods likely aren’t being
moved, which is bad for the economy. The dif-
ferent indexes measure different types and
sizes of companies. And the companies
included in any of these indexes are in flux —
they can change over time.

In general, you compute the previous day’s value of a particular stock by
either adding to or subtracting from the price of the stock at the end of the
day’s trading (Last). If the change is negative, you add that much to the end
value. If the change is positive, you subtract the change from the end value. I
know that this seems backward, but that’s what you’re doing: going back-
ward! To determine the value of the stock at the beginning of the year, divide

Refer to Table 11-1 and determine the price of the Harley-Davidson stock at
the beginning of the day’s trading.
The price of the stock finished at $45.09, and the price went down $2.02
during the day of trading. To get the beginning price, simply add $45.09 +
$2.02 = $47.11. The stock started at approximately $47.
Refer to Table 11-1 and the information involving the Google stock. What was
the price of the stock at the beginning of the year?
The Google stock finished at $648.54, which reflects a 40.8% increase from the
beginning of the year. To solve, let the price of the stock at the beginning of
the year be represented by x. The increase in the price since the beginning of
the year is figured with this equation: $648.54 – x. Set the fraction equal to
40.8%, which is 0.408 as a decimal. (Changing from percents to decimals is
covered in Chapter 2.) To get the percent increase, you divide the difference
by the starting price, x, like this:
.
.
x

Now solve for the beginning price by multiplying each side by x, adding x to
each side, simplifying, and dividing. Your math should look like this:

And, essentially, you’ve divided the current value by (1 + the percent

the beginning of the year.

Computing percent change
As a part of the daily reports on the stock market, you’re told not only how
much the stocks went up or down but also the percent change. Basically, 
percent change is the change (how much the price went up or down) divided
by the starting amount. If the price of the stock goes up, the percent change
is a positive number. If the price goes down, the result is negative.
The percent change is different from stock to stock and from index to index,
because each item has a different base amount. Dividing various changes by
different base amounts gives different decimal values and percentages.
Refer to Table 11-1 and compute the percent changes in the prices of the
Harley-Davidson stock and the Caterpillar stock.
To compute the percent change, you divide the change in the stock by the
beginning value. The Harley-Davidson stock went down $2.02 during the day
of trading, so it started at $45.09 + $2.02 = $47.11. The percent change is the
change of –$2.02 divided by $47.11:
.
.
.
47 11
2 02
0 042878
.
-
-
The change in this case is negative because the stock went down that day.
The Caterpillar stock went up 8 cents that day, so it started at $68.28 – $0.08 =
$68.20. In this case, the percent change is the change of $0.08 divided by
$68.20:
.
.
.
68 20
0 08
0 0011730
.
The Harley-Davidson stock went down by about 4.3% and the Caterpillar
stock went up by about 0.1%. The less the stock costs, the more changes
have the potential to affect the percent change. For instance, if the Caterpillar
stock had cost $6.80 instead of $68, the percent change would have been
closer to 1% than one-tenth of a percent.
Here’s another example: Say that you read in the newspaper that Wiley stock
went up $12 on Monday, which is a 25% increase, and then it went down $12
on Tuesday, which is a 20% decrease. You get out your trusty pen and paper
and start checking the computations (because they just simply can’t be 
correct).
Here’s what you determined: The price of Wiley stock started at $48 at the
beginning of trading on Monday morning. The price increased by $12, so the
percent increase is:
.

Chapter 11: Understanding and Managing Investments

The price of the stock at the end of trading on Monday is $48 + $12 = $60. On
Tuesday, the price of the stock falls by $12. So the percent decrease is:
.

The stock is now back to $48, but the percent increase was based on $48 and
the percent decrease on $60. The larger the denominator of the fraction, the
smaller the percentage (when the numerators are the same).
Using the averages to compute prices
The different stock market indexes (or averages) all give interpretations of the
status of the price of stocks. For instance, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
(DJIA) is based on the prices of 30 representative stocks — but not their exact
stated prices, because a factor enters into the picture. The factor, or dividing
number, is used on the actual prices to try to standardize the prices when
stock splits are involved; you get a more accurate picture of the value of the
stock when increasing the number of shares is taken into account.
The S&P 500 is the Standard and Poor’s average of the 500 biggest companies
in the world. These companies are weighted by their size. Other indexes
include NASDAQ, Amex Market Value Russell 2000, and Wilshire 5000. Each
has its own formulation for determining its value. And the companies used
with any of the indexes today are probably not those used several years ago,
because the companies often come in and go out of the various indexes.
Then the situations of the stocks change, which in turn changes their impact
on the average.
In the following sections, I show you how to use the DJIA and the S&P 500 to
compute stock prices. I include only these specific indexes because they’re
the most recognizable, and the techniques used can be adapted to computa-
tions in other indexes.
Employing the Dow Jones Average
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) isn’t really an average of the values
of the 30 selected stocks; it’s a sum of the worth of those stocks. And the
DJIA doesn’t consist of just industrial stocks anymore. You have technology
and energy stocks and a smattering of the different types of commonly held
stocks, such as McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Home Depot, and Wal-Mart.
Over time, stocks being used by the DJIA may split, making the price per
share lower. In this case, a factor, or dividing number, is applied to the sum of
the stock values to keep the comparison consistent and meaningful. The
factor at any time divides the total cost of the 30 selected stocks. So, if the
factor is greater than 1, the DJIA comes out to be lower than the actual total
154
Part III: Discovering the Math of Finance and Investments 

cost of the stocks. In late 2007, for example, the index was 0.13532775, which
is between one-eighth and one-seventh. Dividing the total cost of the stocks
by this rather small number makes the DJIA much larger than the actual cost
of the stocks.
A stock split is a way that a company makes more shares of its stock available
to the trading public. For example, if you had 100 shares of Company Z worth
$20 per share, after a split you’d have 200 shares of the Company worth $10
per share. You haven’t lost any money; you just have more shares that cost
less. This process of splitting stocks was introduced to lower the cost of a
share and make it more affordable for more people.
If the DJIA is quoted as being 13,010.14 and the index is 0.13532775, what’s
the actual total price of the 30 stocks being used in the index?
Divide the actual total price of the stocks by 0.13532775 to get 13,010.14. Let x
represent the total price of the 30 stocks. Then solve the equation for x by
multiplying each side of the equation by the index value. Your math for this
problem should look like this:
.

1 760 63
.

^
h
The total price of the 30 stocks is about $1,760.63. So the average price of the
30 stocks used is $1,760.63 ÷ 30 ≈$58.67. On average, each stock is worth
about $60. What’s the impact on the DJIA if the price of one stock goes up 
by $2.00?
At first, you want to say that the DJIA increases by 2. But don’t forget the
factor. You divide the $2.00 by the index, 0.13532775, and get roughly $14.78.
So, when you read that the Dow Jones went up by $14.78 in one day, it could
have been that one stock increased by just $2.00.
Weighting share values with the S&P 500
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500) is one of the more widely watched
indexes, and is probably the most popular after the Dow Jones Industrial
Average. The 500 stocks that are represented in the S&P 500 are mostly those
of American corporations. Another qualification of the index is that the S&P
500 uses only shares in a company that are available for public trading.
The numerical value of the index is computed by weighting the share values
(giving more weight or importance to the companies whose stock is worth
more). The weighting is based on the corporation’s total market valuation —
and is extrapolated (using what it was worth some time ago) back in time —
to when the first S&P Index was introduced in the 1920s. The market 
155
Chapter 11: Understanding and Managing Investments

valuation of a company is its share price multiplied by the number of out-
standing shares. The reason that a corporation’s shares are weighted is
because price movements of companies that have a larger market valuation
have more of an influence on the index than price changes in smaller compa-
nies. The following example shows you how a weighted average works.
If Company A has 2,000,000 shares selling at $45.90 each, Company B has
1,000,000 shares selling at $60.80 each, and Company C has 500,000 shares
selling at $120.40 each, what’s the weighted average of one share of each
stock?
If you want to average just the prices of the stocks, you add the three prices
together and divide by 3. For example, you first add: $45.90 + $60.80 + 
$120.40 = $227.10. Now divide that sum by 3, like so: $227.10 ÷ 3 = $75.70.
Unfortunately, this average isn’t a good representation, because too much
emphasis is given to the price of the stock of Company C, which has one-
fourth the number of shares that Company A has. Instead, you have to find
the weighted average.
One way to find the weighted average is to multiply each number of shares
by its price and divide by the total number of shares. Another method is to
find the percent shares that each company has, multiply the percentage by
the share price, and add the products together. I show you both ways in the
following sections for contrast and clarification.
The first method, multiplying the number of shares by the prices, introduces
large numbers that can become difficult to manage. The second method of
using the percentages involves dreaded decimals, but it also gives you a
better perspective on the actual weighting and relative size of the company’s
stock offering.
Method 1: Multiplying the number of shares by price
To find the weighted average of the stock prices with this method, multiply
each number of shares by the price of the stock:
Company A: 2,000,000 × $45.90 = $91,800,000
Company B: 1,000,000 × $60.80 = $60,800,000
Company C: 500,000 × $120.40 = $60,200,000
Now add the products together and divide by the total number of stocks.
First off, find the sum: $91,800,000 + $60,800,000 + $60,200,000 = $212,800,000.
Then find the total number of stocks: 2,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 500,000 =
3,500,000. Now divide the two: $212,800,000 ÷ 3,500,000 = $60.80. The
weighted average is quite a bit lower than the $75.70 obtained by just averag-
ing the three prices.
156
Part III: Discovering the Math of Finance and Investments 

Method 2: Finding the percentage of the stocks
As you discover in the previous section, the three companies offer a total of
3,500,000 stocks. The percentage held by each of the individual companies is
found by dividing the number of stocks a company has by the total number
of all three:
Company A: 2,000,000 ÷ 3,500,000 ≈0.571
Company B: 1,000,000 ÷ 3,500,000 ≈0.286
Company C: 500,000 ÷ 3,500,000 ≈0.143
So Company A has about 57%, Company B has about 29%, and Company C
has about 14%. Multiply each percentage (its decimal equivalent) by the
price of the respective stock and add the results together, like this: (0.571 ×
$45.90) + (0.286 × $60.80) + (0.143 × $120.40) = $26.2089 + $17.3888 + 
$17.2172 = $60.8149, or about $60.81. The average with this method is about
one cent different from the previous method because of the rounding that’s
done with the fractions.
Wrangling with the Ratios
The different stock averages or indexes offer a measure of the activity and
worth of stocks as a whole. Ratios, such as earnings per share, price earnings,
yield, return on investment, return on assets, and profit ratio, offer informa-
tion on the individual stocks. The numbers associated with each ratio allow
you to compare the stocks to one another on another front. In this section, 
I show you the various computations necessary for the ratios.
A ratio is a fraction in which one quantity divides another. The ratio is repre-
sented by the fraction, such as 7⁄8, or by a corresponding decimal, in this case
0.875. When the fraction’s numerator (the top number) is larger than the
denominator (the bottom number), the ratio has a value greater than 1. For
instance, the ratio 9⁄4 = 2.25.
Examining the stock yield ratio
The stock yield ratio, abbreviated Yld on a stock report, is the ratio of the
annual dividend per share and the current value per share of the stock. The
stock yield ratio changes when either the dividends change or when the price
of the stock changes. By referring to Table 11-1, you can see columns for the
dividend (Div), the yield (Yld), and the current price of the stock (Last). If you
divide the dividend by the stock price, you get a percentage — which is how
the value is reported under the yield.
157
Chapter 11: Understanding and Managing Investments

For instance, from Table 11-1, Allstate stock has a dividend of $1.52 per share
and is currently trading at $50.84. To get the stock yield ratio for this stock,
divide $1.52 by $50.84:
.
.
.
50 84
1 52
0 0298977
.
The ratio rounds to about 0.03, or 3 percent.
Using the information in Table 11-1, determine how much the stock yield ratio
changed for Daimler during the day’s trading.
According to the table, the Daimler stock has a dividend of $2 and, currently,
a stock yield ratio of 2%. The stock yield ratio is determined by dividing the
dividend, $2, by the price of the stock, $98.04. During trading that day, the
stock went up by $4.09, so you know that the previous price of the stock was
$98.04 – $4.09 = $93.95. You can now compute the previous stock yield ratio
by dividing the dividend by $93.95:
.
.
.
93 95
2 00
0 021288
.
The ratio rounds to 2%. So it appears that the increase in price didn’t change
the ratio. The apparent lack of change has to do with the rounding. Dividing
$2 by $98.04 gives you a decimal value of about 0.0203998; dividing $2 by
$93.95 gives you the decimal value of about 0.0212879. The decimals are dif-
ferent by about one thousandth (or one tenth of one percent).
The daily fluctuations in a stock’s price usually have little or no impact on the
yield ratio. Over the long run, however, the change is more significant and
apparent. If your stock value goes up and the dividends stay about the same,
the ratio will decrease. You have to decide what you want from your stock:
growth or income.
Earning respect for the PE ratio
The price earnings ratio, or PE ratio, is determined by dividing the price per
share by the earnings per share. The earnings in this case aren’t the divi-
dends paid to the stockholder. The earnings used in the PE ratio are the prof-
its of the particular company. So the PE ratio is determined by dividing the
number of shares the company is offering by the profit associated with those
shares. Try out the following example to better understand what I mean.
One problem with the PE ratio is that the earnings figures may not be
absolutely up-to-date. Even with computerized reporting and instantaneous
figuring, the numbers may not truly reflect the exact value if the information
input is several days old and the price of the stock is that day’s price.
158
Part III: Discovering the Math of Finance and Investments 

Refer to the Table 11-1 entries for Wal-Mart. The PE ratio is given as 15, and
the price per share is $45.50. What are the earnings per share, based on this
information?
You can find the PE ratio by dividing the price per share by the earnings. Let
x represent the earnings in the equation, and then multiply each side by x
and divide by the ratio. Here’s what your math should look like:
.
.
.

So you can see that the earnings are slightly over $3 per share. If you know
the total number of shares involved, you can multiply the $3 by the number
of shares to get the total earnings of the company.
Working with earnings per share
You can determine the earnings per share of stock if you have the price of the
stock and the PE ratio. (Refer to the previous section, “Earning respect for the
PE ratio,” for details on how to compute the PE ratio.) You may be wondering
whether you can determine the earnings per share if you don’t have the PE
ratio available.
The answer is yes! Why? Well, by definition, the ratio is obtained by dividing
the earnings (after taxes) by the number of available shares. So, if a com-
pany’s earnings (after taxes) come to $6,000,000 and 300,000 shares are avail-
able, the earnings per share ratio is:
,
,
,

So the earnings per share is $20 per share.
Calculating profit ratios
When investing in a business or corporation, the investor is usually inter-
ested in the prospect of profits. The revenue, cost, and profit values them-
selves don’t always give you the information that you’re seeking when
deciding on an investment. But with standard profit ratios, you can compare
one company’s ratio with another. Or you can just keep track of how the ratio
is changing within one company.
159
Chapter 11: Understanding and Managing Investments

The return on investment ratio (ROI), the return on assets ratio (ROA), and
the profit ratio provide three different — but somewhat connected — bits 
of information about a company. I explain each of them in the following 
sections.
The return on investment ratio
A company’s ROI ratio, which measures its ability to create profits for its
owners or stockholders, is computed by dividing the net income of the com-
pany by the equity in the company. The ratio as a percentage represents the
dollars in net income earned per dollar of invested capital.
For some types of businesses, an ROI of 15% is satisfactory. After a particular
target ROI is established, a business can adjust its prices and operations to
best meet that mark.
A company has equity of $1,000,000 and a net income of $40,000. What’s its
ROI?
To find out, all you have to do is divide the net income by the equity:
ROI
equity
net income
ROI
1,000,000
40,000
0.04
4%
=
=
=
=
The ROI, as you can see, is 4%. Depending on the business, this percentage is
either satisfactory or unsatisfactory.
The return on assets ratio
The ROA ratio is quite similar to the ROI (from the previous section), but
there are a few differences, which can be better explained by an accountant.
The ROA is computed by dividing the earnings (before interest and taxes) by
the net operating assets. In general, both ratios are reported as percentages,
and, unless unhealthily so, the higher the ratio the better.
A company’s ROA is 8%, and its earnings (before interest and taxes) are
$45,000,000. What are the company’s net operating assets?
Because the ROA is computed by dividing the earnings by the assets, you
find the assets by dividing the earnings by the ROA percentage. Dividing
$45,000,000 by 0.08 you get $562,500,000. Again, you determine, depending on
the business, as to whether this ROA is acceptable for your company or not.
The profit ratio
The profit ratio is a percentage indicating the profit that’s generated for each
dollar of revenue (after all normal costs are deducted). You can determine
the profit ratio by dividing net income by net sales. The net income in this
160
Part III: Discovering the Math of Finance and Investments 

case is the income after all expenses; the net sales represents the total rev-
enue less any returns.
Some companies, such as appliance or software companies, expect a profit
ratio of 30% to 40%. A grocery store, however, expects a profit ratio of 2% to
3%. Why does a grocery store expect less? Well, because it handles a lot of
different merchandise that a lot of people need. Plus, the food found in gro-
cery stores has already had additions to the cost of the raw product because
of processing, transporting, storing, and stocking on the shelves.
What’s the profit ratio of a company whose gross revenue is $50,000,000 
with 5% returns expected? The net income, in this case, is 30% of the gross
revenue.
First determine the net revenue by reducing the gross amount by the returns.
If 5% is returned, then 95% of the gross revenue constitutes the net revenue.
So, to reduce the gross amount by the returns, you multiply the gross rev-
enue by the net revenue: $50,000,000 × 0.95 = $47,500,000. Now find 30% of the
gross income by multiplying the gross revenue by the decimal form of 30%:
$50,000,000 × 0.30 = $15,000,000. Now you’re all set to find the profit ratio:
Profit ratio

The profit ratio is about 31.6%.
Making Use of Your Broker
A stockbroker or financial consultant is someone you can turn to if you need
financial or investment advice. The brokers and brokerage houses have
access to all sorts of information and resources to help you with your invest-
ing activity. The Internet offers lots of opportunities for individuals to do
their own investing, but that means they have to do all the research and dirty
work (which can be difficult).
Those who prefer to go with a professional for advice and resources can take
advantage of such options as buying stocks on margin and using puts, calls,
straddles, and spreads. When you contract with a broker for a put or call, you
pay a commission, because a deal has been brokered — someone had to put
the two parties together to make the transaction work.
Because brokers charge for their expertise, you also need to be familiar with
the commission schedule and what this means to your bottom line. I explain
many of the basics you need to know about investing in the brokerage world
in the following sections.
161
Chapter 11: Understanding and Managing Investments

Buying stocks on margin
The usual procedure for buying some commodity is to make an offer, strike a
deal, pay for the item, and then take it home. In the case of stock purchases,
you make an offer — usually what the market price is at the time — pay for
the item or items, and then receive a certificate showing your ownership of
the stock. There are some variations on making the offer that your stockbro-
ker can tell you about: calls, puts, and straddles are a few of these variations.
Your broker can also explain the process of buying stock on margin. The
margin purchasing option is sort of a cross between buying and borrowing —
at the same time. Essentially, when you purchase stocks on margin, you
arrange to buy a certain number of shares of stock, but you don’t pay the full
price for the stock. Instead, you pay a percentage of the price. The percent-
age you pay is usually 50%, but it can fluctuate between 50% and 100%,
depending on the circumstances. So, if you only pay 50% of the price of the
stock, who pays for the rest? The brokerage house that you happen to be
dealing with. It loans you the money for the rest of the purchase, and it
charges interest, of course. The math involved in margin accounts can be a
bit tricky, but that’s why I provide you with the upcoming example.
The only downside to buying on margin is if the stock goes down instead of
up. In that case, you’ll be asked by the brokerage firm to settle and pay off
the loan or to add additional cash to the account to bring your investment up
to the desired percentage.
162
Part III: Discovering the Math of Finance and Investments 
Puts, calls, straddles, and spreads
I’ll bet you’re thinking that I’ve switched from
math to a football game. No such luck. However,
the calls made in investing are like the plans
made by the quarterback. But football games
can’t wait for days or weeks to see the results of
the call. And, similarly, a spread in bond prices
may act like a point spread prediction of a
sportscaster; the investor is more leery when 
the spread is too great. Okay, enough of the
analogies.
A put is a contract that allows the owner of a
particular stock to sell that stock if it reaches a
particular price in a designated amount of 
time. A call is a contract that gives someone the
right to purchase a given stock at a particular
price — if it reaches that price in a designated
amount of time. An investor uses a straddle if he
contracts for an equal number of puts and calls
with the same price and the same expiration
date (playing it both ways). And a spread is the
difference between the amount in the contract
and the current asking price.
Puts are used by investors who are looking for
a profit from a rise in the stock prices, and calls
are used by investors who expect a profit from
a fall in the stock prices. Confusing? Well, just
remember that it’s more confusing than the
rules for football, but less confusing than the
rules for soccer.

Suppose you establish a margin account with your broker. You arrange to
purchase 100 shares of your favorite stock, which is now selling for $70 per
share. The brokerage house sends you a bill for 50% of the cost of the stock,
which you pay. You agree to pay 7% interest on the difference until the stock
goes up 10% in value (which ends up taking four months). As soon as the
stock increases in value by 10%, you sell the stock and pay back the broker.
How much money do you make on this transaction?
First of all, you determine how much money is being borrowed at 7%. One
hundred shares of stock at $70 per share is 100 × $70 = $7,000. Because you
paid 50% of this bill and borrowed the rest, you paid $3,500 and borrowed the
other $3,500. The interest on $3,500 at 7% is about $20.42. (Computing inter-
est on loans is covered in detail in Chapter 12.) You pay this amount of inter-
est monthly for the four months until the stock goes up to the level you want.
If the stock’s value increases by 10%, it’s then worth the original amount mul-
tiplied by the original 100% plus the increase of 10%: $7,000 × 110% = $7,000 ×
1.10 = $7,700. (You can find out more about percent increases in Chapter 3.)
You pay your broker $3,500, the amount borrowed. So your net profit is the
$7,700 selling price of the stock minus the cost of the stock minus the interest
payments. In other words, your net is: $7,700 – $7,000 – 4($20.42) = $700 –
$81.68 = $618.32. You usually also have to pay broker fees, but you still end
up with a nice profit.
Paying a commission
You pay bankers, mechanics, and accountants for their expertise. Likewise,
you can expect to pay a stockbroker for advice, guidance, and other services
provided by the brokerage firm. Until a few years ago, stock was bought in
lots of 100 (multiples of 100); those that weren’t purchased in lots of 100 were
deemed odd lots. In this case, a price differential was then applied to the odd
lots to make up for the inconvenience of not dealing with nice, round num-
bers. In other words, the broker received the usual commission, based on the
purchase price, and an extra charge was added on for the strange number of
stocks purchased.
Nowadays, any number of stocks can be purchased, and the commission is a
percentage of the purchase price. Different brokerages have different com-
mission scales, but most charge somewhere between 1% and 3% of the pur-
chase price. The more stock you purchase and the greater the price you pay,
the smaller the percentage you’re charged.
Table 11-2 is a possible commission schedule. The number of stocks being
purchased is multiplied by the cost per share to determine the purchase
price. The maximum commission is $500 and is paid for any transaction
whose price is $50,000 or more.

What’s the commission paid on the purchase of 250 shares of stock that cost
$47.90 per share?
The purchase price is 250 × $47.90 = $11,975. An $11,000 purchase puts you in
the 2% category. So the commission is $11,975 × 2% = $11,975 × 0.02 = $239.50.
Investing in the public: Buying bonds
A bond is a way of investing in a corporation, university, or some other public
project. Essentially, you’re lending money to the institution with the expecta-
tion of getting back your principal plus some interest. In most cases, the
bond and interest are all paid back at the end of the agreed-upon time period.
In some cases, however, the bond is discounted — the interest is deducted
from the amount loaned and is paid to the bondholder up front.
Most bonds are arranged for with your stockbroker. You can purchase trea-
sury bonds or savings bonds at a bank, but the others are negotiated through
a brokerage firm.
Bonds are different from stocks, because a stockholder is actually a part-
owner of the enterprise when they hold the stock certificates. A bondholder is
just a lender. Many issues of bonds are available on the principal exchanges,
which means that the stockbroker is aware of and can make recommenda-
tions as to their availability and advisability.
Bonds come in all shapes and sizes and arrangements of payments. You have
tax-free bonds, zero coupon bonds, premium bonds, and discount bonds. You
decide with your broker how you want to arrange your profit — equally over
the term of the bond, more upfront, or more toward the end. The variations
are many.
Check out this example to see how to calculate bond interest: Suppose you
invest $10,000 in bonds at a 5% annual rate of interest. The agreement stipu-
lates that the company make semi-annual interest payments until the bond is
repaid. How much interest is paid each year?
The annual interest of 5% on $10,000 earns 0.05 × $10,000 = $500 each year;
half is paid each six months. Not too bad!

L
oans are a necessary part of life. They allow consumers to buy houses,
cars, and furniture, and they help to pay for college. Loans allow busi-
ness owners to expand their facilities, improve their inventories, and even
weather tough times. The specifics of the loan depend on many things. Some
of the questions you have to ask yourself are: Is the loan secured? (Do I have
some asset that the lender will get if I don’t pay the money back?) How long
will I be borrowing the money? Will I pay the money back all at once, or will I
pay it back in installments?
Loans come in one of several forms. For instance, they can be in the form of a
promissory note or a discount note. Discount notes are called such because
the interest amount is deducted from the amount that’s borrowed. A credit
card balance is also a form of loan. This type of loan doesn’t have a set end 
to it — you pay back the balance, but not necessarily for any fixed amount of
time. Installment buying is another form of loan. And, finally, there are per-
sonal property or business loans.
You need to arrange for the type of loan that best fits your needs. And you
better know the ins and outs of the numbers involved. After all, you don’t
want to get involved in a loan that costs more than it should or that puts you
into a position that you don’t want to be in. This chapter helps with all this
and more.

Taking Note of Promissory 
and Discount Notes
A promissory note is a legal document that requires the borrower to pay back
the amount he or she owes at specific time intervals and at a specific fixed
rate of interest. With this type of note, you determine the amount of interest
based on the face value — the amount borrowed — and you determine how
all the money will be paid back over time. The terms of the note may include
the deduction of interest from the amount borrowed — in which case the
note is called a discount note.
Promissory notes may be used when a business borrows from other individu-
als and groups rather than banks or other institutions. The note is the legal,
official statement of the terms. The terms of the note may be better than what
you can get at the bank — if you’re dealing with good friends or relatives — or
not necessarily all that good. But you may have no other option. The following
sections describe both full face value notes and discount notes.
Facing up to notes that 
have full face value
A promissory note in which the interest isn’t deducted has full face value. In
other words, you get the full amount of money, and nothing is deducted from
what you’re given. When you pay back what you owe, you add the face value
(the amount of money borrowed) and the interest and then make arrange-
ments for payment of that sum. The upcoming example shows you the best
way to calculate payment amounts when it comes to full face-value loans.
Here’s a clue that will help you with the example problem: Simple interest is
determined with I = Prt, where I is the amount of interest, P is the principal or
amount borrowed, r is the rate of interest, and t is the time in years. (You find
lots of information on simple and compound interest in Chapter 9.)
Say, for example, you borrow $20,000 for 3 months in order to pay for some
holiday inventory. You agree to make 3 monthly payments and pay 9% inter-
est compounded quarterly. How much is each of your payments?
First you have to compute the interest using the simple interest formula that
I mention earlier in this section. To do so, you simply have to plug the num-
bers you know into the formula. For instance, you replace the interest rate,
9%, with its decimal equivalent, 0.09. You also replace the amount of time
with 0.25, which is one-fourth of a year (3 months). And, of course, you know
the loan amount, $20,000, which is put in place of the principal.
166
Part III: Discovering the Math of Finance and Investments 

So, here’s what your math looks like: I = $20,000 × 0.09 × 0.25 = $450. Add the
interest to the principal, and you owe a total of $20,450. When you divide the
total by 3 (to get the amounts of the payments), the answer doesn’t come out
evenly. So, instead, you can make two payments of $6,816.67 and one pay-
ment of $6,816.66.
Discounting the value of a promissory note
Suppose you want to borrow $10,000. You arrange for the transaction and
sign a promissory note. The note is then discounted — the amount of the
interest is deducted from what you’re given. In other words, you don’t have
the full $10,000 to work with, but you have to pay the face value, $10,000,
back to the lender. Discounting a note isn’t an unusual practice, so make sure
you know what you’re getting into. The payments for a discount note are
fairly straightforward to determine. You may want to rethink the transaction,
though, and increase the amount of the note so that you have more money to
work with.
One of the more well-known types of discount notes is the U.S. Treasury bill,
in which you’re the one loaning money to the U.S. Government for a period of
time.
Working with a discounted note
Say that you’re borrowing money for a short period of time and agree to the
terms of a discount note. Now you need to determine what the payback looks
like. To do so, you have to subtract the interest owed from the amount bor-
rowed. Here’s an example to get you started.
A discount note is arranged so that $10,000 is borrowed for 6 months at 12%
compounded monthly. The interest is deducted from the amount of the note,
and you agree to pay the money back in two installments — one at the end of
3 months, and the other at the end of the 6 months. How much money do you
actually get to work with, and how much do you pay back?
First determine the amount of interest using the interest formula, I = Prt. The
interest rate of 12% is written 0.12 as a decimal; the 6-month period is half a
year, or 0.5. So the interest on the note is figured like this: I = $10,000 × 0.12 ×
0.5 = $600. With this loan, you’re actually given $10,000 – $600 = $9,400. You
pay back the full $10,000, so your two payments are each $5,000.
Increasing the amount of the discount note to cover expenses
If you’re borrowing money using a discount promissory note, you may have a
target amount in mind. To ensure that you get the amount you need after the
discounting, you may have to increase the face value of the note.
167
Chapter 12: Using Loans and Credit to Make Purchases

For instance, if you need $50,000 to cover expenses for 3 months, and you
arrange for a discount note charging 10% interest, you don’t get the full $50,000
to work with. Instead, you get $50,000 minus the interest charge. So, instead of
borrowing $50,000, you need to increase the amount of the note to an amount
that allows you to end up with $50,000 after the interest is subtracted.
To find out how much you need to increase the note by, consider the follow-
ing: The $50,000 you want is the difference between the face value of the note
and the interest paid. Let f represent the face value and I the amount of inter-
est. Three months is one-quarter of a year, or 0.25.
So here’s what the equation would look like:
$50,000 = f – I
= f – (f × 0.10 × 0.25)
You replace the amount of interest, I, with the face value times the interest
rate of 10% times the quarter year. Now you’re ready to solve for the value of f:

As you can see, if you arrange to borrow about $51,282, you’ll have your
$50,000 to work with during those 3 months.
Borrowing with a Conventional Loan
A conventional loan may come in the form of a mortgage on a building, a car
or truck loan, a building equity loan, or a personal loan. Loans are available
through banks, credit unions, employers, and many other institutions. Your
task is to find the best possible arrangement to fit your needs. If you’re com-
fortable doing the legwork and computations yourself, get out paper, pencil,
and a calculator and start searching the newspaper and Internet. If you don’t
trust yourself quite yet, find an accountant or financial consultant whom you
trust and feel comfortable talking to.
168
Part III: Discovering the Math of Finance and Investments 

You can compute the interest and payments of a loan by using a book of
tables and your handy, dandy calculator, or you can even find a loan calcula-
tor on the Internet. The variables involved in the computation of loan pay-
ments are
 Amount of money borrowed
 Interest rate
 Amount of time needed to pay back the loan
Each of these variables (values that change the result) affects the result 
differently — some more dramatically than others.
Dealing with a bank or financial institution may seem more impersonal than
dealing with an acquaintance or small lender, but the trade-off is more flexi-
bility in payment schedules, availability of more money, and, usually, better
rates and terms of the loan.
Computing the amount of loan payments
You can determine the amount of your loan payments using tables of values
or a loan calculator. If you’re more of a control person (like me), you proba-
bly want to do the computations yourself — just to be sure that the figures
are accurate.
The periodic payment of an amortized loan is determined with this formula:
R
i
Pi
1
1
n
=
-
+

^
h
where R is the regular payment you’ll be making, P is the principal or amount
borrowed, i is the periodic interest rate (the annual rate divided by the
number of times each year you’re making payments), and n is the number of
periods or payments.
Try your hand at determining a payment with this example: What’s the
monthly payment on a loan of $160,000 for 10 years if the interest rate is
9.75% compounded monthly?
The interest rate per month is 9.75% ÷ 12 = 0.8125%, or 0.008125 per interest
period. The number of payments, n, is 10 years × 12 = 120. Using all the
values in the formula, you get:

Chapter 12: Using Loans and Credit to Make Purchases

So the monthly payments are about $2,100. To find the total payback, simply
multiply the monthly payment by the number of payments: $2,092.32 × 120 =
$251,078.40. So more than $91,000 is paid in interest. (The interest is the total
payback minus the amount borrowed: $251,078.40 – $160,000 = $91,078.40.)
Considering time and rate
There’s no question that the amount of money borrowed affects the condi-
tions of a payback. After all, the more you borrow, the more you’re going to
owe. But the rate of interest and amount of time needed to repay the money
act a bit differently in the overall payback. I explain both of these in the fol-
lowing sections.
Taking your time to repay a loan
Spreading your loan over a longer period of time makes your regular pay-
ments smaller. But what does spreading out those payments do to the total
amount of the payback? And how does spreading out the payments affect the
total amount of interest? Well, it only makes sense that the longer you take to
repay a loan, the more you’re going to pay for the privilege of doing so.
Table 12-1 gives you an example of how time affects payback — both in the
monthly payments and the total amount repaid. The figures in Table 12-1 are
all based on a loan of $40,000 at 9% interest compounded monthly.

As you can see from Table 12-1, the payments are much smaller if you pay
back in 40 years rather than in 10 years. But the amount of interest paid is
enormously greater when spread over the longer period of time.
170
Part III: Discovering the Math of Finance and Investments 

Showing an interest in the interest rate
As astounding as increasing the amount of time to repay a loan can be in
terms of interest paid, an increase in the interest rate tends to be just as
astonishing. For instance, increasing the rate by only 1% makes a significant
difference when you’re paying over a multiyear period.
Table 12-2 shows you what happens to a $40,000 loan as the interest rate
increases. In the table, you see the total payback and interest paid if the loan
is for 10 years and if the loan is for 30 years.

$148,120.20 ($108,120.20)
Table 12-2 confirms it: The higher the interest rate, the more you pay in inter-
est. At 6% and 30 years, you pay a little more than twice what you borrowed
after adding interest. At 12% and 30 years, you pay over $100,000 more than
you borrowed just in interest.
Determining the remaining balance
If you borrow money using a 20- or 30-year loan and then, all of a sudden, you
have a windfall and want to clear all your debts, you need to know what’s left
to pay on your loan. You may not expect to win the lottery, inherit a fortune,
or receive some other type of windfall when you take out a loan, but you really
should avoid any contracts that penalize you for making an early payment.
Get rid of that type of clause, if you can. It won’t hurt anything if you do get
that windfall, and you’ll save money if you’re able to settle up before the end
of the loan term. By paying early, you avoid paying some of the interest.
However, most amortized loans build in high interest payments at the begin-
ning of the payback. So you want to get that windfall early in the game.
171

where B is the remaining balance on the loan, R is the regular payment

the number of payments that have already been made.
Say that you’ve been paying off a 20-year loan and are 10 years into the pay-
ments. You think you have close to half the loan paid, right? Wrong! Check
out the following example to see why you aren’t so close to having your loan
paid off.
Ten years ago, you took out a 20-year loan for $60,000 at 7.25%. You make
monthly payments of $475. But now you’ve inherited some money and want
to pay off the balance of the loan. How close is the balance to being halfway
paid off?
To find out, you use the formula to estimate the remaining balance. First
figure out the values of all the known variables. The value of i is 7.25% ÷ 12 ≈
0.604167%, or 0.00604167; n = 20 × 12 = 240; and x = 10 × 12 = 120. Now you’re

Halfway through the loan period of 20 years, only one-third of this loan has
been paid off. Yikes!
Paying more than required each month
Say that you’ve taken out a loan and arranged for monthly payments over a
20-year period. Then you realize that you’re able to pay a little more than the
monthly payment. Is it a good idea to do so? Absolutely! Making payments
larger than necessary is a splendid idea. You’ll finish paying off the loan much
sooner, and you’ll save lots of money in interest.
172
Part III: Discovering the Math of Finance and Investments 

Making larger-than-necessary payments reduces the amount of the principal
still owed, which in turn reduces the interest that needs to be paid. Why?
Because the monthly interest is figured based on the current principal, and
the interest is paid first. Anything left goes toward reducing the principal. At
the beginning of an amortized loan schedule, most of the payment goes
toward interest.
Table 12-3 shows you how much of a payment on a 20-year, $100,000 loan at
6% goes toward interest and how much goes toward the principal. The
monthly payments are about $716.44.

$712.87

You see that most of the payment goes toward interest at the beginning of the
20 years. Toward the end, most of the payment goes toward the principal.
The last payment is only $712.87. By increasing the payment to $800 each
month, the additional $83.56 goes toward reducing the principal. This way,
the loan is paid off in about 16.5 years instead of 20. And the total amount of
interest paid is reduced.
To figure out how much interest is saved, multiply the payment amount by
the total number of payments you’ll make in 20 years (20 × 12 = 240 pay-
ments): $716.44 × 240 = $171,945.60. The loan is for $100,000, so $71,945.60 is
paid in interest. The number of payments in 16.5 years is 16.5 × 12 = 198. By
increasing the payments to $800, you end up paying $800 × 198 payments =
$158,400. The interest paid this time is $58,400. The savings is over $13,500.
How did I get the number of payments needed at $800? The easiest way to
figure this out is with a spreadsheet and formulas that you type in for the
interest and payments. I explain how to set up spreadsheets in Chapter 5.
173
Chapter 12: Using Loans and Credit to Make Purchases

Working with Installment Loans
An installment loan is a loan in which the principal and interest are paid back
in installments. What makes the installment loan different from a conven-
tional loan or promissory note is that the amount paid in each installment
and the number of installments are what drive the interest rate. The interest
may or may not be clearly indicated. The annual percentage rate, or APR, is
the actual rate of interest charged for the privilege of having the loan. The
stated rate and the actual rate are usually completely different things. For
example, the stated rate may be 4%, but if you take into account the effect of
monthly compounding, that rate is really 4.07415%. The difference may not
seem like much, but it adds up when you’re dealing with lots of money. A for-
mula allows you to determine the annual percentage rate. I introduce this for-
mula in the following section.
Installment loans are commonly used when making purchases from retailers
who are anxious to move their merchandise and earn a profit not only from
the markup but also from the interest on the loan. You may be willing to pur-
chase an item using an installment loan if your only option is to let that mer-
chant be your banker. If you aren’t in the position to pay cash or borrow
more money from a bank, the installment plan allows you the use of the mer-

Calculating the annual percentage rate
The APR isn’t something that’s widely broadcast on many installment loan
contracts; you’ll see the stated interest amount, but the APR takes a little
more figuring. It takes into account the effects of compounding and any fees
and extra charges. If you’ve ever tried to find a formula for determining APR,
you’ve probably discovered that it’s difficult to find one. Most Web sites just
want to do the calculations for you. It must be assumed that you really don’t
want to tackle a formula or that it’s beyond your capabilities. Well, I know
better than that! Of course you want to do the math!
The best formula I’ve found is a variation on Steve Slavin’s formula in
Business Math (Wiley). Here it is:

where m is the number of payments made each year, P is the principal or
amount borrowed, r is the interest rate, t is the number of years involved, and
n is the total number of payments to be made. After you determine your vari-
ables, you’re all set to plug in and solve. Try out an example.

Part III: Discovering the Math of Finance and Investments 

What’s the APR of a loan for $6,000 for 2 years at 10.125% interest with
monthly payments?
The number of payments per year, m, is 12; the interest rate, r, is 10.125, or
0.10125; the amount of time, t, is 2; and the number of payments, n, is 2 × 12 =
24. Plugging these numbers into the formula for APR and solving gives you an
answer:

The APR of 19.44% is much higher than the stated interest rate of 10.125%.
You don’t have any choice on the rate — the APR is what’s used in the com-
putations. You just need to know what you’re getting into when you agree to
a particular stated rate.
Making purchases using 
an installment plan
Making purchases with an installment plan allows you to make use of the item
or items you’re purchasing while you’re paying for them. Making installment
purchases is often a necessary part of doing business. For instance, you may
need machinery or supplies to provide services or produce products. The
profit from those services or products allows you to make the installment pay-
ments. The trick is to be sure that you aren’t paying more than you intended
for the machinery or supplies. The stated costs or payments may be decep-
tive. You may think that you’re getting a good deal — until you do the math
and determine that the total payback far exceeds the value of the item.
For example, an advertisement claiming that you can purchase a riding trac-
tor for just $2,500 down and $200 each month for the next 5 years may seem
like a great deal. But how good a deal is it? Read through the following exam-
ple to find out.
So, say that you’re deciding whether to purchase a $10,000 riding tractor
using an installment payment plan in which you put down $2,500 and pay
$200 each month for the next 5 years. What’s the APR on this plan?
175
Chapter 12: Using Loans and Credit to Make Purchases

You first need to determine the finance charge, because no interest rate is
given. The total cost to you is the down payment of $2,500 plus 5 years of
monthly payments of $200. So your cost is $2,500 + 5 × 12 × $200 = $2,500 +
$12,000 = $14,500. You’ll end up paying $14,500 for a riding tractor that costs
$10,000 in cash. So the extra charge is $14,500 – $10,000 = $4,500.
Using the formula for APR, the number of payments per year, m, is 12. The
principal, P, is $12,000 (the 5 years of payments), and the total number of
payments, n, is 60. By plugging these numbers into the formula, you get

In This Chapter
 Understanding banking basics
 Making daily computations of balance and interest
 Performing reconciliation on your bank accounts
You can find as many types of bank accounts as you do banks. And keep-
ing the names of the types of accounts straight is as much of a challenge
as keeping up with the current name of your bank (you’d think they were
required to change every week!). What is consistent in banking, though, is the
basic mathematics involved when doing the computations. No matter what
type of account you have, the math for average balance, daily interest, and
additional fees is always the same.
The average balance versus daily balance affects the amount of money earned
in interest over a period of time. Your bank’s computers do the computations
swiftly and automatically. Luckily, though, you can reproduce them with a
simple calculator — although maybe not quite as quickly.
Reconciling your checkbook or savings account register is a necessary task.
The reconciliation can go smoothly, if you keep good, accurate records. On
the other hand, if you throw in a simple reversal of numbers or forget to
enter a transaction, you’ll be faced with the challenge of making right a
wrong. In this chapter, I help you gather the skills and arithmetic techniques
needed to keep your banking house in order.
Doing Business with Banks
Whether you like it or not, banks and other financial institutions are in busi-
ness to make money. So you end up paying for their services in one way or
another — even with free accounts. For instance, you may pay fees for the
following reasons:
 Excessive check writing
 Falling below a predetermined balance

 Having insufficient funds
 Making telephone transfers
 Obtaining account printouts
 Replacing ATM cards
 Stopping payment on a check
 Transferring funds
 Withdrawing money from an ATM that isn’t on your system
As you can imagine, it just makes sense to be familiar with all of your bank’s
different services — and their corresponding fees. That way you can deter-
mine which account best accommodates your needs.
The following sections give you some basic (but important) info on bank
accounts, including the types available and how to maintain them.
Exploring the types of business 
bank accounts available
Most banks offer many different options for large and small businesses. It’s
up to the individual business to decide which type of account or accounts to
use based on the type of balance the business can maintain and the types of
services it uses most frequently. A good business manager will choose wisely
when it comes to the types of accounts, and he or she will see that all the
minimums and other requirements are met.
The following sections show examples of the many accounts that are avail-
able and the services and benefits associated with the accounts. Every bank
will have its own set of accounts, and the wise business manager will weigh
all the benefits against the possible costs.
The small business checking account
When a business is relatively small or just starting up, the small business
checking account makes sense, because it requires a minimum daily balance
of only $50 or $100. The small business checking account is usually noninter-
est bearing, and you assume that you’ll make few actual transactions. The
bank may set a limit of 100 or 200 transactions, which are free of charge, and
then it will charge for any transactions in excess of the limit.
The basic business checking account
A business that’s well established or involved in a moderate level of activity
will use a checking account that has a higher minimum balance accompanied
by corresponding increased services. These basic business checking accounts
may have an established monthly maintenance fee that’s waived if the 
180
Part IV: Putting Math to Use in Banking and Payroll 

minimum balance of $500 or $1,000 is kept in the account. The number of free
transactions allowed with such an account may be as many as 400 or 500.
After exceeding that number, a fee is charged. Other services that are often
provided with such an account include night deposit service, coin process-
ing, and free online bill payments or tax payments.
The commercial checking account
Accounts for businesses that have large volumes of deposit and check writ-
ing activity fall into a commercial category of checking accounts. The mini-
mum daily balance may be as low as $100, but the potential for earning
interest on the funds in the account occurs if the daily balance stays above
some higher amount, such as $1,500 or $2,000. Commercial accounts usually
offer unlimited credit and debit activity.
The business interest checking account
Businesses that can depend on having large daily balances — and that need
to keep funds fluid — can arrange for a business interest checking account.
With this type of account, businesses can get increasing interest rates
depending on the amount of money kept in the account. For example, a rate
of 0.37% may be paid if the balance is less than $25,000, and the increments
may increase to 0.55% if the balance exceeds $250,000. Fees may or may not
be charged on these accounts.
The community checking account
Most banks offer special accounts, called community checking accounts, for
nonprofit, religious, and other community organizations that have a moder-
ate level of deposit and check-writing activity. Such accounts usually waive
any fees as long as the business keeps a minimum balance of $50 or $100 in
the account. However, businesses often have the potential for earning inter-
est if the amount in the account exceeds a predetermined amount such as
$1,500 or $2,000.
The business savings account
When a business wants to earn decent interest on deposited money but still
wants to keep it relatively fluid (not invested in a bond or CD), the business
savings account is the way to go. The rate of interest depends on the amount
in the account, and the business can avoid service charges if a minimum bal-
ance is maintained.
Understanding the importance 
of account management
Managing your bank account is important for a couple of reasons: It enables
you to avoid unnecessary fees, and more important, it allows you to make
181
Chapter 13: Managing Simple Bank Accounts

smart decisions about your money. You choose the type of bank account that
works best for the type of business that you have. You need to consider how
many deposit and payment transactions you expect to make each month.
And you need to determine how much money you can afford to have out of
your reach. In other words, you need to know how much money you can have
invested and earning interest or maintaining a minimum balance. After all,
you want your money to be working for you, not against you. The saying that
money begets money is true in the world of banking — as long as you know
how to invest it properly.
Depending on the type of account in which you have your money, you may be
subject to some fees for the privilege of doing business with the financial
institution. Some banks provide accounts that waive a monthly fee if you
keep a certain minimum daily balance in the account. However, if you go
below that minimum, even for a day, you end up paying the fee that month.
Another charge that you may incur is a per-check fee after you’ve written a
certain number of checks for the month.
Keeping your money in an interest-bearing account can help offset some of
the fees, but you need to determine whether having the minimum amount of
money in the account is worth it. You may be earning interest in that interest-
bearing account, but the rate of interest may be too small to consider having
a large amount of money in that account. In other words, you may be better
off investing the minimum elsewhere and simply paying the fees.
When managing your accounts, it’s important to keep an eye on all the fac-
tors involved, and not just on your deposits and withdrawals. For instance, 
to manage your account successfully, you need to
 Know your bank’s fee policies. Determine which services are free and
which have a charge (and under what conditions the charge is applica-
ble). Consider the different types of accounts and the fees associated
with each type.
 Determine which options are less costly. Compare the cost of fees for
services with the loss of interest income from having substantial cash in
a noninterest-bearing account. Consider the cost of convenience in
terms of travel and business.
 Keep track of your account balances. Arrange for a daily review using
Internet access. Chart normal balances during different times of the
month.
Suppose you have a checking account in which you only pay the $7.50 monthly
fee if your daily balance falls below $500 during any day of the month. Is this a
good deal? Or are you better off paying the $7.50 monthly fee and keeping the
$500 in a savings account that pays 1% interest?
You’re probably better off keeping the $500 in the checking account. Why?
Well, first of all, the total amount of interest earned on $500 at 1% interest,
182
Part IV: Putting Math to Use in Banking and Payroll 

compounded quarterly, is slightly more than $5. And that’s for the whole
year. Even if you tried to keep most of your money in a savings account and
periodically transferred some of it over to the checking account as needed,
you’d be hit by other fees for doing all the transferring. Just plan well, and
don’t let the account balance fall below the $500 amount.
Here’s an example to consider: Imagine that you have a checking account
exactly like the one shown in Table 13-1. For this account, you pay a fee of $9
per month if the balance falls below $1,000 during any day of the month. You
also pay a per-check fee of $0.25 per check for each check in excess of 35 for
the month. Your account is interest-bearing, paying 1.51%, which is credited
to your account monthly. Suppose you wrote 40 checks (which all cleared)
during April. What’s your balance on May 1, after all these transactions?
Table 13-1

April 30

$5,590
To figure out the balance, here are the things you need to take into 
consideration:
 From Table 13-1, you see that the balance was below $1,000 for three
days, so the monthly $9 fee will be applied.
 In Table 13-2 (which you can find later in this chapter), you can see the
interest earned at 1.51% is computed and comes out to be $4.51 for the
month of April.
 Because you wrote 40 checks, you have to pay $0.25 for each of the last
5 checks, which totals $1.25.
183
Chapter 13: Managing Simple Bank Accounts

To find the net result, you first have to add all the fees and interest, like this:
–$9.00 + $4.51 – $1.25 = –$5.74
Now subtract that total from the balance of $5,590 on April 30, which gives
you $5,584.26 at the start of May.
Balancing Act: How You and the Bank
Use Your Account Balance
Your bank or financial institution keeps track of the balance in your accounts
on a daily basis. In fact, with today’s availability of online banking, the bank
computers can tell you minute by minute what your account balance is. They
do this in response to additions and subtractions to your account.
The balance in your account is an important number to both you and the
bank. Here’s why:
 The bank needs to know your balance in order to know how much inter-
est to assign your account (if it’s interest-bearing). It also needs the bal-
ance to determine whether you need to be charged for letting your
balance fall beneath a predetermined level.
 You need to know your balance in order to decide whether you have
enough money to pay those pesky bills. Plus, you want to know whether
you’re earning the maximum amount of available interest.
You and the bank also both need your balance to compute the average daily
balance, which is used in determining whether any fees need to be charged
for services rendered. And once your average daily balance is computed, you
can use it to figure out the interest you’re earning on your account. Read on
for details.
Computing your average daily balance
An average daily balance is used by banks and credit card companies
because the amount of money in an account (or the amount of money
charged on a credit card) can fluctuate greatly from day to day or week to
week. The bank would prefer that you have approximately the same amount
of money in your account throughout the month so that it can accommodate
business transactions and lending more easily. But the reality is that busi-
nesses need cash to pay bills and employees at certain times of the month;
so those payment times may not coincide with the revenue deposits.
184
Part IV: Putting Math to Use in Banking and Payroll 

When your bank uses an average daily balance for any of its reports or com-
putations dealing with your account, it simply finds the balance in the
account for each day and then averages them. In other words, the daily
amounts are added up, and the sum is then divided by the number of days.
The bank does this because it’s the fairest and best way of determining inter-
est and fees. Instead of using the largest or smallest amount or the most fre-
quent amount, the average amount is the figure used in the computations.
You can figure the average daily balance one of two ways:
 You can do a simple average by adding all the daily balances together
for a given month and then dividing by the number of days.
 You can use the method that employs a weighted average.
A weighted average is useful because, with many accounts, the balance
remains unchanged for several days in a row — or even for a week or so. Plus
you have fewer numbers to deal with if you do a weighted average. Instead of
having about 30 different numbers in the computation (depending on the
number of days in the month), you have only as many numbers as there are
different amounts in the account. Because of these advantages, I focus on the
weighted average for purposes of this chapter.
To find the weighted average, multiply each different balance by the number of
days the account was at that amount, and then divide by the number of days.
To practice with an example, check out Table 13-1 (you can find it earlier in
the chapter), which shows an account and the activity in that account during
the month of April. Using the info in that table, find the weighted average.
Note: Because the numbers are all in whole dollars, they really aren’t all that
realistic. But illustrating the average balance doesn’t require nitpicking with
pennies, so I made the computations easier.
April, as you know, has 30 days. To find the weighted average you have to
account for the balance on each of the 30 days, add up the numbers, and
then divide by 30. To determine the number of days at each value or balance,
you subtract the date numbers. For example, the balance was $444 for three
days (April 20 – April 17 = 3 days).
The weighting part of the weighted average comes from multiplying each bal-
ance by the number of days that the account had that balance. For example,
here’s what the math for the example should look like:
$4,321× 1 + $4,666× 3 + $2,210× 5 + $3,444× 7 + $444× 3 + $2,789× 2 +
$1,789× 2 + $6,356× 5 + $7,590× 1 + $5,590× 1 = $108,925.
Now divide this weighted total by 30 to get the average daily balance:
$108,925 ÷ 30 ≈$3,630.83.
185
Chapter 13: Managing Simple Bank Accounts

If you look at Table 13-1 again, you’ll notice that for 11 days in April, the
actual balance was higher than the average daily balance, and the other 19
days had an average daily balance that was lower than this average. Why is
this important? Well, different accounts have different qualifications, and the
average daily balance and exact daily balance each play a part in the fee fig-
ures. Because computerized computations are available, financial institutions
can figure fees and interest on the balance day-by-day rather than using the
average. When you’re figuring your average daily balance for your own pur-
poses, though, you don’t want to deal with that many numbers; the weighted
averages are more efficient and quicker for you to compute.
Determining interest using 
your daily balance
The interest earned on money in your account usually accrues for a certain
amount of time — for a month or three months, for example — and then that
interest is credited to your account as a deposit. To determine the amount of
interest earned daily (or over several days, when your balance stays the same
for a while), you have to divvy up the stated interest rate into a daily amount.
186
Part IV: Putting Math to Use in Banking and Payroll 
Go Phish?
E-banking has increased in popularity over the
past ten or so years because of certain services
that e-banks provide. Consider these popular
services:
 Online bank statements and daily 
transactions
 Instantaneous transfers from account to
account
 Online bill payment, which helps you avoid
checks, envelopes, or stamps
 Online deposits
Accompanying the ease and convenience of 
e-banking are the opportunities for attacks by
the unscrupulous. Phishing is done when scam
artists send e-mails that are created to look like
they’re from your financial institution. You’re told
that you need to verify personal information to
protect your account. However, the very e-mail
is the attack upon you and your finances. Even
clicking on the link could subject you to spy-
ware, key-logging software, or Trojans being
installed on your computer. You pay dearly for
your curiosity.
In your e-banking research, you may have come
across the terms float or floating. What does
floating have to do with online banking (besides
adding to the rather tenuous theme)? Again,
with the convenience of e-banking comes the
blessing and curse of rapid banking processes.
With instantaneous processing, you have less
time to get money into a checking account
(assuming it’s not already there).
The key to using online banking effectively is to
keep careful track of your account balances.
Also safeguard your personal information at
every turn, and don’t be tempted to answer
unsolicited or unfamiliar e-mails.

The decimal values get pretty small when you divide them into daily amounts,
so you have to carry some extra decimal places in your computation. And you
have to be sure not to round off the numbers too soon. For example, when
dividing 4.5% by 360 days, you get 0.045 ÷ 360 = 0.000125. If you rounded to the
nearer ten-thousandth, you’d have 0.0001, which would make the results too
low when used in multiplications.
To get some practice, use the numbers from Table 13-1 (shown earlier in the
chapter) to find the interest earned by the money in the account for each bal-
ance shown. Assume that the bank in this case is paying 1.51% interest.
The first step is to get a daily interest rate. To do so, divide the overall inter-
est rate, in decimal form, by 365. (Refer to Chapter 2 if you need a reminder
on how to change 1.51% to its decimal equivalent.) Here’s what your daily
interest rate should be:
.
.
365
0 0151
0 00004136986301
.
The result of the division doesn’t come out evenly, which is why you see
quite a few digits in the decimal answer. Keep all of the decimal places for
now, and be sure to use them in your computations.
Now, to compute the interest earned for each different balance, you multiply
the amount of money by the number of days the account showed that bal-
ance by the interest rate per day.
An electronic spreadsheet will make short work of the computations, even
when using all those decimal digits. Refer to Chapter 5 for more on using
spreadsheets for your calculations.
Table 13-2 gives the account balances from Table 13-1, and it shows you the
interest earned for each different balance and each different length of time.
To save room in the table, I let I represent 0.00004136986301 in each case. The
results are rounded to nine decimal places.

Now, you just have to add up all the interest amounts for the month, which
gives you $4.506212328. And that means the interest earned is about $4.51 for
the month of April. Great work!
Reconciling Your Account
All bank accounts that you put money into (deposits and interest, for exam-
ple) and that you withdraw from, need to be reconciled. Reconciling your
checking or savings account means that you’re performing an audit or check
of the figures over a particular time period. The word reconcile literally
means to bring into agreement or harmony — to make compatible or consis-
tent. So, in other words, you want the money in the account to agree with
what you think should be there.
Reconciling isn’t a critical factor when it comes to stable accounts such as
CDs, which are primarily accruing interest. However, checking accounts (and
some savings accounts), which see a lot of regular action need to be recon-
ciled on a daily or weekly basis. The following sections show you how to go
about reconciling your account and correcting errors when you find them.
Banks issue monthly reports to both aid your reconciliation process and to
prompt you to do this periodic audit. However, the monthly printed reports
that you receive in the mail are often out of date in terms of recent activity.
These printed statements don’t reflect the past few days’ worth of deposits
and withdrawals. Luckily, many banks provide online access in case you need
records that reflect accountings to that day.
188
Part IV: Putting Math to Use in Banking and Payroll 

Making reconciliation simple
To reconcile your banking records, you need the statement from the bank
and you need your own accounting records, such as a checkbook register or
other bookkeeping device. It also helps to have a good head for numbers (or
a calculator if you aren’t number savvy). Your bank statement will likely list
your current balance, transactions during the previous time period (usually a
month), and other tidbits of information, such as average balance, a numeri-
cal listing of cleared checks, and postings of fees and interest.
Table 13-3 shows a shortened version of a checking account register. It has a
column for checkmarks indicating that a transaction has shown up on the
bank statement.

Notice the checkmarks in the check register in Table 13-3. You insert these
marks into your register to indicate the transactions that appear on the bank
statement. For example, as shown in Table 13-3, at the time of the reconcilia-
tion, the automatic payment to the utility company and the check for taxes
haven’t yet cleared the bank. The insurance settlement check isn’t showing
on the statement yet, either.

Chapter 13: Managing Simple Bank Accounts

Most bank statements include forms on the back that you can use for your
reconciliation computation. To actually compute the reconciliation, you need
to add up all the outstanding checks or other debits (those that haven’t yet
been cleared by the bank), and then you add up all deposits not shown on
the statement. The general format of the reconciliation looks like this:
+ Bank balance shown on statement
+ Deposits not yet appearing on the statement
– Checks and other debits outstanding
= Balance showing in your register
Try working a reconciliation as practice. Reconcile the account shown in
Table 13-3, assuming that the bank balance on the statement is $801.09 (you
don’t see the bank statement; just use this number for convenience).
Here are the steps to follow:
1. Add up all the deposits in the register that aren’t shown on the bank
statement.
You see only one such entry, the insurance settlement of $5,200.
2. Add up the debits not appearing on the statement.
The two such debits are: $313.07 + $3303.07 = $3,616.14.
3. Do the appropriate adding and subtracting.
Your calculations should look like this:

Finding the errors
Unless you’re a really perfect person, not all reconciliations of a checking or
savings account come out correctly the first time, every time. In fact, even
the most nimble of number-smiths make occasional errors when adding or
subtracting — especially when the person doing the computation is in a
190
Part IV: Putting Math to Use in Banking and Payroll 

hurry or distracted by something. Or you may input one wrong digit in an
amount, which subsequently throws you off. No matter what the problem is,
if the amount that’s supposed to be in the account doesn’t coincide with the
amount that you have in your register (or spreadsheet), you have to back-
track, do some checking, and find out where the error is. The following sec-
tions show you the different errors you might make and how to find them.
Adding incorrectly
One of the first places I check when my numbers don’t jibe is the listing of
outstanding checks and debits. Because I tend to add two consecutive checks
in my head and write the total (supposedly to save time), errors can and do
occur. If, after checking your addition, you get the same sum for the outstand-
ing checks, go back and be sure that you didn’t miss one or write down a
check that’s already cleared.
Reversing the digits
Another common error in check registers involves reversing digits. Many
people (including yours truly) have a tendency to reverse numbers when writ-
ing them down or entering them in a calculator or computer. I find that mum-
bling the numbers to myself helps keep them in the right order. (I do get funny
looks at times, so it’s best to only mumble to yourself when you’re alone.)
One indication that your error might be from reversing digits is when the sum
of the digits from the number you’re supposed to have in your reconciliation
computation and the sum of digits from the balance in your register are the
same, even though the numbers are different. (Refer to the nearby sidebar,
“Casting out nines,” for an explanation as to why this can be.)
For example, if your check register shows a balance of $94.99 and the compu-
tations for the reconciliation come out to $95.08, you add up the digits in
$94.99 to get 9 + 4 + 9 + 9 = 31. Then add up the digits in 31 to get 3 + 1 = 4.
Now do the same thing with $95.08: 9 + 5 + 0 + 8 = 22, and 2 + 2 = 4. Having the
same sum-of-digits doesn’t for sure mean that you reversed digits, but it gives
you a place to start when looking for the error.
Homing in on the difference
Another way to find an error in your check register — if that’s where the 
discrepancy comes from — is to find the difference between the balance in
your register and the balance that you think you’re supposed to have. For
instance, if the difference between the two is $48, you can then look through
your register and the bank statement for an item that’s $48 or for one that’s
half that amount, $24. If you’ve missed checking the amount off or entered it
in the wrong place, you’ll find your error more quickly if you know what
number you want.
191
Chapter 13: Managing Simple Bank Accounts

And last, but not least (are you getting the impression that I have been there
and done that with my check register?), when the numbers don’t agree,
check to see if you’ve remembered to subtract automatic payments. It’s con-
venient to have bills taken out automatically, but you have to be careful that
you subtract them from your register.
192
Part IV: Putting Math to Use in Banking and Payroll 
Casting out nines
A quick, neat trick for checking whether the
addition in a long list of numbers is correct is
called casting out nines. The procedure in cast-
ing out nines works like this:
1. Cross out all the 9’s and groups of digits
that add up to 9 from the numbers being
added.
2. Add up the digits that are left.
If the sum has more than one digit in it, add
these digits together — and keep repeating
until you have just one digit left.
3. Perform Step 2 for the sum.
If the digit you got from the numbers being
added and the digit in the sum aren’t the
same, you know that the sum is incorrect.
For example, look at the addition problem and
the method of casting out nines side by side:
3419
6223
5401
8322
23365
3419
6223
5401
8322
23365
Cross out the 9.
Cross out 6 and 3.
Cross out 5 and 4.
Cross out 8 here and the 1 above.
Cross out 3 and 6.
+
+
The more obvious 9’s and the numbers adding
up to 9 are crossed out on the right. (Other com-
binations and groupings can be crossed out,
too, but enough digits have been eliminated to
illustrate the method.) Look at the digits that
haven’t been crossed out in the numbers being
added. Their sum is: 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 3 + 2 +
2 = 19. Cross out the 9 in 19, and you’re left with
1. Or you can add 1 + 9 = 10 and then 1 + 0 = 1.
You’ve been able to reduce all the digits above
the addition line to a 1. Keep that number in
mind; it’s your target or goal for the digits in the
sum. Now look at the sum (the number below
the addition line). Add up the digits in the sum
that haven’t been crossed out: 2 + 3 + 5 = 10, and
1 + 0 = 1. The digits remaining above and below
the addition line, after casting out nines, are the
same. So you know that your addition is correct.
Now, to be honest with you, the casting out
nines method isn’t a fool-proof one. If the two
numbers that you’re comparing (the digits you
got from the numbers and the digit you got from
the sum) are different, you can be sure that your
sum is wrong. However, if the two digits are the
same, there’s still a slight chance that your sum
is wrong. For instance, you’ll get a false positive
if your incorrect answer is off by 9. However,
this method is so quick and easy that it’s worth
the slight chance of an error in your error.

nsurance is a risk pool. What’s that, you ask? It’s something that’s formed to
reduce losses in the case of some huge, catastrophic occurrence. For exam-
ple, insurance companies in Florida, where hurricanes are fairly common, may
form a risk pool with Midwestern insurance companies, where you find sea-
sonal tornadoes. The companies share the risk and the expense when claims
are filed after a bad storm in one place or the other. Being a risk pool, an insur-
ance company accepts risks. Accepting risks, however, isn’t the same as taking
risks. The risks involved in the insurance business are closely tied to the
chance that a loss will occur. The loss is based on a monetary amount for prop-
erty, health, life, or some other entity that has value. And basic to this chance
of loss is determining the probability that a loss will occur.
When you start talking about probability of loss, that’s when actuaries come
in. These folks are mathematician-accountants who study conditions and his-
tories to determine the probability (percentage chance) that a particular
occurrence will transpire; this numerical probability helps determine the
amount of the insurance premium and even whether the insurance company
wants to do business with the client at all.
Insurance policies are many, and they’re all varied. The pages of small print
on most policies spell out all the details — what’s covered and what’s not. In
this chapter, you see how to do some of the computations you need in order
to be best served with insurance policies by the insurance companies. The
math involved in this chapter is no more than percentages and ratios and
some multiplication and division. However, it’s the application of those num-
bers and operations that sometimes gets a bit sticky. You won’t be on par
with an actuary after reading this chapter, but you’ll definitely be able to
keep up with the information from and structures of insurance coverage.

Surveying the Types of 
Insurance Available
In order to cover all of the important things in life, insurance comes in many
different flavors. Here are the main types of insurance that you’ll run across
in your quest for coverage:
 Liability insurance: Liability insurance covers claims made by others
(not the insured) for losses caused by the insured. This type of insur-
ance is probably most well known in terms of medical professionals.
 Health insurance: This insurance is used to make financial payments to
hospitals, clinics, physicians, and other health professionals on behalf of
the insured.
 Property insurance: This type of insurance involves buildings, various
structures, contents of buildings, and vehicles. The risks included in prop-
erty insurance are fire, storms, wind, earthquakes, water, and collision. Any
or all of these risks may be covered by insurance — although sometimes
with a high premium. I cover property insurance in more detail in the later
section, “Protecting Yourself from Loss by Insuring Your Property.”
 Life insurance: Life insurance, which seems as if it’s misnamed, is
payable at the death of an individual. Life insurance is designed to
replace the loss of wages (due to an untimely death) of an income-
producer. The funds or payout provided by a life insurance policy are
intended to provide the income needed by the recipient or recipients of
the policy until such funds are no longer needed. In order to establish
how much life insurance needs to be purchased, you need to determine
how much yearly income is needed and for how long. (See the upcoming
section, “Living It Up with Life Insurance,” for further details.)
Insurance comes in many different varieties, but the common theme of all 
of them is the quest to reduce loss if something catastrophic happens. You
really hope that you’ll never need the insurance; but you have the insurance
just in case you have to cover the expense of replacing what’s lost. Also
common to the different types of insurance are the various computations
necessary. Many of the mathematical procedures work much the same for
the different types of insurance.
Living It Up with Life Insurance
Many types of life insurance are available — and each type has its own con-
tingencies and variations that are designed to fit the particular needs of an
individual or a company. In this section, you find explanations of the types 
of life insurance that are designed to help individual employees. I also explain
194
Part IV: Putting Math to Use in Banking and Payroll 

the type that benefits the company. So, whether you’re deciding on a pro-
gram for your employees or some protection for the company, here you find
out how to deal with the options and mathematics of the decisions. Here are
the types of insurance you’re likely to see:
 Ordinary life insurance is insurance that doesn’t expire before the
death of the insured. This type has an initial premium that doesn’t
increase, and it has a cash value. An advantage to this insurance is that
you can budget a set amount for the insurance and not have to worry
about the premium increasing as a person gets older.
 Participating whole life insurance provides premiums to the policy-
holder. If the insured expects to have income from the paid premiums,
this insurance is an option.
 Endowment insurance has a term of a specific length (either in years or
up until a certain age) and pays the premium if the person dies. This
insurance also returns the premiums to the insured if they survive the
term of the insurance.
Each type of insurance has its pros and cons, can be purchased individually
or with a group, and is suitable for different situations. One of the main con-
siderations for any of these types of insurance is the cost. Ordinary life, for
instance, may have cheaper premiums, but you don’t get the income. So you
have to decide whether the income is worth the additional cost. You need to
do the math and determine whether, in your specific situation, a type of
insurance makes sense.
Insuring with a group
Group insurance is arranged by a company or other organization (virtually any
group of people) with the goal of decreasing the ratio of the overall risk — and
consequently, the total amount of the premiums. Some companies offer more
than one type of life insurance to their employees, but most find one type that
fits their situation (and budget) the best.
For example, a company can offer life insurance to its employees as a fringe
benefit. The total amount of insurance provided to an individual is usually
tied to earning level or longevity, and companies often offer options for
employees to increase the amount of coverage if they want to. The insurance
rate or cost is determined by the ages or conditions of the people being cov-
ered, and, because many people are involved, the risk is spread out (aver-
aged) to make the cost less than if the policies were purchased individually.
The policies may also have a provision that decreases the amount of life
insurance to be paid out after an employee reaches the age of 65 or 70.
When determining the cost of providing life insurance for employees, part of
the computation involves the age of the individuals involved. You find the
number of people in each age group and compute the cost at each level.
195
Chapter 14: Protecting Against Risk with Insurance

Another factor to consider is the length of service of different employees. You
can reward long-serving staff by providing more coverage. Again, the compu-
tations involve how many are at each level and the projections of cost into
the future.
Start with a basic example. Say that Ajax Company offers life insurance for its
employees as a fringe benefit. Each employee has $10,000 in life insurance for
the first $25,000 in yearly earnings. The amount of insurance increases by
$5,000 for each additional $10,000 earned by the employee. How much life
insurance do employees Tom, Dick, and Mary get if their yearly earnings are
as follows:
Tom: $27,543
Dick: $47,343
Mary: $63,255
Tom only qualifies for a $10,000 life insurance policy. He needs to earn at least
$35,000 to get an additional $5,000 added to the basic policy. Dick, on the other
hand, qualifies for a $20,000 policy. He earns $47,343, which is $22,343 more
than the $25,000 yearly earnings base. The difference of $22,343 is actually two
$10,000 increments — each increases the policy by $5,000 for a total increase
of $10,000. Mary qualifies for a life insurance policy of $25,000. If you subtract
$63,255 – $25,000, you get $38,255. That’s three increments of $10,000 (plus the
remainder), so she gets $15,000 added to the base policy of $10,000.
If you have a large number of employees in your company, you’d be better off
making a chart of the earnings ranges and insurance amounts. That way you
don’t have to compute each person’s insurance coverage individually. Here’s
an abbreviated example of what I mean:
Earnings
Amount of life insurance
$25,000 through $34,999
$10,000 insurance
$35,000 through $44,999
$15,000 insurance
$45,000 through $54,999
$20,000 insurance
$55,000 through $64,999
$25,000 insurance
Try out this example, which has a bit of a twist: Beta Company offers its basic
life insurance package to all employees and also offers supplemental cover-
age that’s paid by both the employee and the company. The cost of the sup-
plemental coverage is based on the employee’s age. Say that there’s also a
provision that the maximum amount of supplemental coverage may not
exceed three times your salary. Having said all that, say that Moe, Larry, and
Curly apply to increase the amount of their life insurance policies. Determine
how much each pays for his supplemental coverage. Use Table 14-1 and the
following information to determine your answer:
196
Part IV: Putting Math to Use in Banking and Payroll 

Moe, who’s 46 years old, earns $64,000 each year and requests $100,000
of additional life insurance.
Larry, who’s 29 years old, earns $83,000 each year and wants $200,000 of
additional insurance.
Curly, who’s 60 years old, earns $57,000 and asks for $250,000 of addi-
tional insurance.

The rates given are per thousand dollars, so you multiply each rate by the
number of thousands in the supplementary policy. Here’s how the example
would break down:
 Moe pays 0.175 per thousand dollars. Because he wants an additional
$100,000, he pays 0.175 × 100 = $17.50 per month for the additional cov-
erage. The company pays 0.005 × 100 = $0.50 per month for his supple-
mentary insurance.
 Larry pays 0.078 × 200 = $15.60 per month for an additional $200,000 life
insurance. The company pays 0.002 × 200 = $0.40.
 Curly is denied his request. Why? Well, according to the table, he earns
$57,000. Because 3 × $57,000 = $171,000, the $250,000 life insurance
exceeds his allowed amount (because he can’t have any amount over
three times his salary). If he goes for the $171,000, he’ll pay 0.468 × 171 =
$80.03 per month for the extra coverage. The company will pay 0.012 ×
171 = 2.052, or $2.05 per month.
Ready for a more advanced example? Consider this: Happa Kappa Company
offers life insurance coverage for its employees to the tune of three times the
salary of that employee for that year. However, the life insurance coverage
starts to decrease, on a graduated scale, at age 65. Stella is 69 years old and
earns $250,000 this year. If she gets a 61⁄4% raise next year, what will her death
benefit be? Table 14-2 shows the payout schedule for Happa Kappa Company.

First determine Stella’s earnings for next year. A 61⁄4% raise means that she’ll
earn $250,000 × 1.0625 = $265,625. Because she’ll be 70 next year, her death
benefit would be 67% of three times that salary: $265,625 × 3 × 0.67 =
$533,906.25.
How does this payout compare to the benefit if she dies this year at her cur-
rent salary, and the policy pays at 80%? To find out, simply multiply like so:
$250,000 × 3 × 0.80 = $600,000.
Tripling her raise doesn’t make up for the decrease in percentage. (If you need
a refresher on percentages and percent increases, go to Chapters 2 and 3.)
Protecting your business with 
endowment insurance
Life insurance is designed to replace the income or wages of a person who
has dependents, partners, or a business. The insurance doesn’t replace the
person and what he or she has to offer in physical production or guidance,
but the monetary relief helps the family or business continue financially.
Endowment insurance is a type of life insurance that can be used to protect a
business partner in the event of the other’s death. With endowment insur-
ance, you choose a particular term, such as 20, 25, 30, or more years. Or you
pick a particular age of the person being insured to be the end date of the
insurance, such as age 50 or 65. Then if the person dies, a set amount is paid
to the partner. If the person survives the term or age, the premiums are
repayable to the insured.
When determining whether you want term insurance or endowment insur-
ance, you consider several things:
 How much would it cost to replace the person and keep the business
running as usual?
198
Part IV: Putting Math to Use in Banking and Payroll 

 How much does each type of insurance cost, and can you afford either
type?
 How likely is it that you’ll need the insurance? (Of course, you don’t
know any more than the insurance companies actuarially, but you do
have a better feel for the health and well-being of the people involved.)
Try this example on for size: Stan and Ollie just opened a new pet shop and
have invested most of their life savings in the endeavor. They have two other
salespersons, but Stan and Ollie will only take a minimal salary until the busi-
ness picks up. They decide to insure each other’s life for 10 years in order to
cover the cost of hiring additional help should one of them die. Their choices
are between term insurance and endowment insurance. At their age, term
insurance costs $11.60 per thousand per year, and endowment insurance
costs $44.60 per thousand per year. Which is the better choice?
First, determine the cost of each over the 10-year period. To do so, assume
that the policy is for $200,000. The term insurance costs $11.60 × 200 × 10 =
$23,200. The endowment insurance costs $44.60 × 200 × 10 = $89,200. If one of
them dies and the other collects the $200,000, then it seems that the term
insurance is the much better deal. After all, it’s more than $60,000 cheaper.
But with the endowment insurance, the premiums are returned if they both
survive. They’d each have $89,200 to spend at the end of 10 years. So, in this
case, the endowment insurance is probably the way to go.
As you can see, the difference in cost between term insurance and endow-
ment insurance can be significant. So what if you decide to become your own
“broker” and offset the end-of-term settlement that’s available with endow-
ment insurance by banking the difference in cost? Of course, you need to
have enough discipline to keep your hands off the money you’re putting in an
account. One way to help you with that self-discipline is to contract for an
annuity — you’ll be more apt to make the regular payments with this type of
account. In Chapter 10, I discuss all the details of annuities. For now, I just
offer the basic equation:

where A is the total amount of money that’s accumulated, R is the regular
periodic money payment, i is the interest rate for each payment period (writ-
ten as a decimal), and n is the total number of payment periods.
Using the scenario from the previous example, consider what would happen
if Stan and Ollie put the difference between the two policies in an annuity
during the 10-year period (in other words, they pay for the term insurance
and save the difference). How would the money in the annuity compare to
the lump sum payment?
The difference between the two policies is $33 per thousand dollars or $33 ×
200 = $6,600 per year. If you put this in an annuity at 4% interest, the amount
at the end of 10 years is

The $79,240 doesn’t quite match the repayment on the endowment policy,
but if both partners survive for all or most of that 10 years and they bought
the term insurance, they’d have the money in the annuity (they don’t get the
refund if the insurance is paid out). It all depends on who you want to take
the risk. In other words, are you willing to pay the higher amount to the
insurance company and lose the chance of the lump sum if something hap-
pens to the insured? Or would you rather pay the insurance company a
smaller amount and faithfully bank the difference so that you’re sure to have
a lump sum at the end of the time period? That’s what insurance is all about:
risk and chance and who takes the risk and chance.
Protecting Yourself from Loss 
by Insuring Your Property
Owning property brings with it a lot of possibilities: pleasure, extra income,
security, and, of course, risk. Many folks tend to focus on the risk because all
pieces of property are at the mercy of the actions (or inactions) of nature and
people. But luckily, insuring your property passes the risk of loss to another
entity: the insurance companies. The insurance companies determine the
risk of loss in your particular situation. Then they factor in the cost of operat-
ing expenses, add in some profit, and set an amount that you pay them for
taking the risk.
Different types of buildings have different rates of insurance. These rates are
all based on what the buildings are constructed of, where they’re located, and
what type of work takes place in them (storage or manufacturing, for exam-
ple). Some buildings are constructed of brick and stone and others mainly of
wood. Some are on the sea coast and others are in tornado-prone areas. Some
buildings house families, others house retail enterprises, and yet others con-
tain manufacturing activities. Actuaries, which I explain earlier in this chapter,
weigh all of these factors and determine the risk for specific buildings.
After the rates are set, you may consider coinsurance, multiyear contracts,
multiple building insurance, and maybe some sort of deferred payment plan.
I explain each of these in the following sections.
Considering coinsurance
When you insure your property for just part of its value, you’re considered a
coinsurer. You’re taking on part of the risk, and the insurance company is
taking on the rest. A common coinsurance contract is the 80% coinsurance
200
Part IV: Putting Math to Use in Banking and Payroll 

clause. This clause stipulates that if the insurance covers at least 80% of the
value of the property, the insurer will pay all of the losses up to the amount
on the policy. An 80% coinsurance policy only applies if the property is
insured for 80% of its value or less. If the property is insured for less than
80% of its value, the insurer will pay an amount that’s found with the follow-
ing equation:
Payment
80% of value of property

The following two examples show you the difference between insuring your
property for the full 80% of its value as opposed to insuring it for less than
80% of its value. You use the same equation for each, but you see that insuring
for the full amount results in the first fraction just becoming the number 1.
Here’s an example to try: Nancy has a summer home at Lake of the Ozarks
worth $100,000, and she has it insured with an 80% coinsurance clause. Say a
fire caused $40,000 in damage. How much can she expect in payment if she
has insured the home at $80,000?
After plugging the numbers into the formula, you get the following:

You can see that Nancy will collect the full $40,000, because she gets full cov-
erage as long as the loss is less than the $80,000 face value of the policy.
Now consider this example: Say that Chuck’s neighbor decides to economize
and reduce the cost of insurance on his summer home. His 80% coinsurance
clause has his $100,000 summer home insured at $50,000. If a tornado does
$60,000 in damage, what will the insurance payment be?
If you plug the appropriate numbers into the formula, your math looks like this:

As you can see, Chuck’s neighbor probably regrets being so frugal.
Coinsurance is also used when you insure a property for less than it’s worth.
You use coinsurance when a property appraises for less than what was paid
for it. In general, coinsurance is used to save on the cost of the insurance
policy. However, the insured is taking on some of the risk and responsibility
for a portion of the loss if it occurs. A person who wants to insure property
for the full value pays a higher rate; this higher rate is called the flat rate.
Say, for example, that Helen bought a building for her quilting business and it
cost her $100,000. The building was then appraised at $72,000, so she insured
it for $72,000 (the full value of the building). One month after moving in, a 
fire caused $50,000 damage to the building. What did she collect under 80%
coinsurance?

$45,000 is nine-tenths of her loss.
Examining multiyear contracts
Multiyear contracts are contracts for more than one year. Multiyear contracts
are for two, three, or more years in which the rates are a specified amount.
Either the same rate is charged each year, or a graduated rate is agreed on in
the contract. Buildings and their contents are usually eligible for these types of
contracts at reduced rates. Why? Well, insurance companies want to increase
the number of years a contract is binding because it provides stability for their
business. Businesses like multiyear contracts because they help them with
their financial planning, and because the reduced rates save them money.
Consider the following multiyear rates for premiums of a particular insurance
coverage (you can assume that the premiums are paid at the start of the
insurance term):

The effects of the Great Chicago Fire
The city of Chicago, Illinois, was growing rapidly
in the mid-1800s. In fact, the building industry
was struggling to keep up with expansion.
Much of the city at that time was constructed of
wood. The buildings weren’t the only parts
made of wood, either; most of the paved streets
and sidewalks consisted of pine or cedar planks
as well.
On October 8, 1871, in the middle of a particu-
larly dry Indian summer, the wind was blowing
strongly from the southwest. A fire started in the
O’Leary barn (because of a well-placed cow
hoof, as legend has it) and rapidly spread to the
northeast, leaping across the Chicago River and
burning for more than a day. By the time the fire
died out (it started to rain on Tuesday), it had
burned a swath four miles long and three-
quarters of a mile wide. Almost 20,000 buildings
were destroyed, and 100,000 people were left
homeless. Nearly 300 people died; it was a mir-
acle that the number wasn’t greater.
Only about half the properties that were burned
were insured. And only about half of those
insured buildings were ever paid for. The insur-
ance companies were not only overwhelmed
with claims, but many were also burned down
themselves. The fire destroyed roughly one-
third of Chicago’s property value.

Rate
1 year
1.00
2 years
1.85
3 years
2.70
4 years
3.55
5 years
4.40
Using these rates, compute the following: If the cost for 1 year’s insurance is
$2,000, what’s the cost for 3 years of insurance? How much is saved?
To find your answer, multiply the 1-year cost by the 3-year rate: $2,000 ×
2.70 = $5,400. So, if 3-year-long policies were purchased, the cost would be:
$2,000 × 3 = $6,000.
As you can see, the savings is $600 because $6,000 – $5,400 = $600. Of course,
that’s assuming the insurance can be purchased for the same amount 3 years
in a row. It’s definitely nice to lock in the cost!
Taking advantage of multiple 
building insurance coverage
When a person or company owns several buildings, it’s usually advantageous
to insure all the buildings and the contents of the buildings under a single
contract. This way, you spread the risk over all the different properties.
Formulas for determining the overall cost of such a contract incorporate
these items:
 Multiple building volume credit
 Multiple building dispersal of risk
 Loss ratio
The credits and ratios are just small parts of the total calculation needed to
determine the premiums. Computers are fed all the vital information and
claim history, and the amount of the premium is spit out.
But for you, knowing the parts that some of the listed items play in the over-
all picture helps you determine which factor is having the greatest impact on
the cost of insurance. Knowing the impact helps with future plans and econo-
mizing efforts. I explain each of the parts in the following sections.
203
Chapter 14: Protecting Against Risk with Insurance

Determining the multiple building volume credit
A multiple building volume credit is an amount of money credited against the
total premium. (Remind you of income tax credits?) In other words, if the
annual premium exceeds a certain amount, the percentage of the premium in
excess of the maximum figure is deducted.
Consider this example: Suppose that the amount of a multiple building pre-
mium subject to the volume credit is the amount of the premium exceeding
$3,000. The credit is 5% of the premium excess. If the annual premium is
$14,000, what’s the credit?
First find the amount of the excess by subtracting $3,000 from the premium
amount: $14,000 – $3,000 = $11,000. Multiply the excess by 5% to get the
volume credit: $11,000 × 0.05 = $550. So the premium of $14,000 is reduced 
by $550 due to the multiple building volume credit.
Exploring the multiple building dispersal risk
The point of taking advantage of a multiple building rate is that the risk is
spread over several properties. But if one property is worth considerably
more than the others, the risk is centered too much in one place. For exam-
ple, if you have ten properties worth $10,000 each and one property worth
$1,000,000, most of the worth is found in just one of the properties. The risk
(value) isn’t spread out very evenly. This is an extreme example, but I think it
proves my point.
Tables that are used to determine how much of a credit is given for multiple
buildings incorporate the number of buildings involved and the maximum
percentage value that any one building has. It’s best if no one building repre-
sents more than 20% of the total value of all the buildings.
Consider again the extreme example of owning ten properties worth $10,000
each and one property worth $1,000,000. Of course, the value of the million-
dollar property has the greatest percentage of the worth. But what exactly is
that percentage?
To find the percentage value of the million-dollar building, first find the sum
of all the values of all the properties: 10 × $10,000 + $1,000,000 = $1,100,000.
Now divide $1,000,000 by that sum in order to get 0.909, or 90.9%. The million-
dollar building is worth too much — it’s almost 91% of the value of all the prop-
erties added together. You won’t get any percentage credit for that package,
because the one building is worth so much more than all the others together.
Now consider a more reasonable grouping of properties. Figure the percent-
age of the property worth the most. The eight buildings involved are worth
the following amounts:
204
Part IV: Putting Math to Use in Banking and Payroll 

A: $500,000
B: $600,000
C: $700,000
D: $800,000
E: $1,200,000
F: $2,300,000
G: $2,400,000
H: $6,000,000
The total value of all eight buildings is $14,500,000. Property H has the 
greatest value, so divide its worth, $6,000,000, by the total value: 
$6,000,000 ÷ $14,500,000 ≈0.414, or 41.4%
You may qualify for a small discount. However, that building is still worth
much more than the others.
Computing the loss ratio
The loss ratio is a percentage determined by dividing the total losses by the
total premiums during a particular time period. Here’s the formula:
Loss Ratio
Premium Amount Number of Years
Total Losses During the Time Period
#
=
The loss ratio is used when determining the loss modification factor, which is
an adjustment to the premium amount based on the loss history from the
past few years. The idea is for the loss modification factor to result in a
reduction in the premium.
Check out this basic example: Say that a company is renegotiating its multi-
ple building insurance contract. The agent needs the loss ratio as part of the
loss ratio modification factor. In the past 5 years, the company has had
$60,000 in losses and has paid premiums of $20,000 per year. Using these fig-
ures, determine the loss ratio.
To compute the loss ratio, you divide the losses by the total premiums for
the 5 years like this:

So, as you can see, the loss ratio is 60%. Depending on what the projected or
expected losses were — and how much of a variance from those losses is
considered above or below normal — an adjustment may be considered.
205
Chapter 14: Protecting Against Risk with Insurance

Deferring premium payments
As you probably know, insurance is usually paid in advance. You pay for one
year of coverage at the beginning of that year (or three years of coverage at
the beginning of the three years). But, even though you sign up for insurance
for three years, you may be able to defer payments for the second two years
until the beginning of each of those years. Of course, the insurance company
prefers that you pay for all three years at the beginning, so the company
makes it more attractive for you to pay upfront with one payment. However,
rest assured that if you aren’t in the position to pay the total amount all at
once, you can opt for three installments instead.
Before committing to one payment plan or another, you want to determine
how much more it will cost you to pay in several installments than to pay all
at once, at the beginning. The following example shows you what I mean.
Suppose that a three-year contract for property insurance has a total pre-
mium of $20,000. Two different deferred payment plans are possible: one for
three payments and the other for six payments. The three-payment plan calls
for 35% of the premium at the beginning of each of the three years. And the
six-payment plan has you paying 20% of the premium biannually at the begin-
ning of each six-month period. How much more do you pay for the insurance
if you opt for one of the deferred payment plans (as opposed to paying it all
upfront)?
If you pay three times, you pay 35% of $20,000 three times. You can find the
amount of each payment by multiplying like this: $20,000 × 0.35 = $7,000.
Three payments of $7,000 comes to a total of $21,000. You pay $1,000 more
for the convenience.
If you pay six times, you pay 20% of $20,000 six times. Multiply to find the
amount of each payment: $20,000 × 0.20 = $4,000. Six payments of $4,000 is
$24,000. That’s $4,000 more than you’d pay if you made one payment at the
beginning of the three years.

Chapter 15
Planning for Success 
with Budgets
In This Chapter
 Introducing the different types of budgets
 Examining cash budgets
 Keeping track of changes in inventory and budget ramifications
 Completing a variable analysis
A
budget is really just a plan. It incorporates what’s anticipated in terms
of revenues and expenses and provides a basis for comparison to what
actually transpires. The figures in a budget are based on history and reason-
able projections into the future. A budget helps a company make plans and
motivate its employees, and it serves as a standard to measure performance.
Budgets usually are created for an entire year, but some companies prepare
new budgets more frequently in order to make necessary revisions. A vari-
ance analysis (which I discuss later in this chapter) is used to measure just
how different the budgeted items are from the actual. With the figures, the
variance analysis also helps determine future actions.
In this chapter, you see different types of budgets at work, and I help you
decide how to best use the one or ones that are right for you and your busi-
ness. You also see different ways to compute, massage, manipulate, and ana-
lyze budgets and budget items.
Choosing the Right Type of Budget
A budget can take on many different forms, so you have to pick the one or
ones that work best for you. You can choose from several different types of
budgets, including operating budgets, sales budgets, production budgets,
cash budgets, and capital expenditure budgets. A budget can be as simple or
complex as necessary to keep track of your company’s financials and to pro-
vide the needed information in a timely fashion.

The following are some types of budgets that you may find used by compa-
nies or organizations. The different budgets can then be controlled by a
master budget. The processes and mathematics found in each type of budget
are similar, so you find examples from any that can be applied to the others.
Here are some of the common types of budgets:
 Operating budget: An operating budget contains information on the
resources that are needed to perform the operations and to provide
reimbursement for services provided. A school system uses an operat-
ing budget to outline the salaries paid, cost of transportation and utili-
ties, and so on.
 Sales budget: A sales budget outlines the projected sales levels and the
amount of revenue expected to be collected. The sales budget helps pro-
duction divisions determine how much product to provide.
 Production budget: A production budget includes beginning inventory
from an earlier production period and projects the amount of produc-
tion necessary to meet the new needs. The production budget is closely
tied to the sales budget.
 Cash budget: A cash budget is responsive to the rest of the budgets in a
company, because it’s used to estimate the cash flow needs of the differ-
ent divisions of the company.
 Capital expenditure budget: A capital expenditure budget contains not
only amounts of money to be used for purchases during the current time
period, but it also outlines the accrual of money for purchases in the
future.
 Master budget: A master budget can be used to keep track of the differ-
ent divisions of a company through their individual budgets. It can be
used to do periodic measurements of how the different departments are
doing with respect to their projections.
Cashing In on Cash Budgets
A cash budget is used to plan for the anticipated sources of cash and the conse-
quent uses of it. In other words, this type of budget consists of numbers reflect-
ing the cash that comes in and the cash that goes out. A cash budget, which is
used to ensure that enough cash is on hand, shows the following items:
 Entries of cash on hand
 Expenditures
 Receipts of cash
208
Part IV: Putting Math to Use in Banking and Payroll 

A cash budget allows a financial manager to determine whether a loan is nec-
essary to meet the payment needs of the company — to compensate employ-
ees and cover bills, for example.
Looking at an example cash budget
Table 15-1 shows an example cash budget for the first three months of the year.

The first three lines of the cash budget in Table 15-1 show the cash balance
(at the beginning of the month), the anticipated receipts, and the sum of the
beginning balance and receipts. The next three lines show disbursements, or
expenditures. The operational disbursements are roughly the same through-
out the three months — at about $280,000. A big capital expenditure (new
equipment) accounts for the much larger total disbursement in March. The
total cash needed is the sum of the disbursements plus the desired minimum
cash desired. The excess or deficiency entries are missing from the table on
purpose. The following example shows you how to determine these figures
when you have the rest of the budget worked out.
Refer to Table 15-1 and determine the excess or deficiency for each month.
Then determine the amount of money that needs to be borrowed in March to
keep the cash balance at the desired level.
209
Chapter 15: Planning for Success with Budgets

The amount that belongs on line A is the difference between the total cash
available in January and the total cash needed in January. So subtract it out
like this: $400,000 – $330,000 = $70,000.
Similarly, the amount that belongs on line B is the difference between the
total cash available in February and the total cash needed. Subtract the fig-
ures: $520,000 – $330,000 = $190,000.
The ending balance for both January and February is the sum of the excess
or deficiency and the desired $50,000 cash balance. Notice that the ending
balance for each month is carried up to the beginning cash balance of the
next month.
The amount on line C is a negative number, or deficiency. When you subtract
the total cash needed from the total cash available, you get: $590,000 –
$735,000 = – $145,000.
Negative numbers are written in parentheses in a balance sheet, so you write
“($145,000)” on line C. By borrowing $145,000 and entering that number on
line D, the deficit is taken care of, and the ending balance is exactly what you
want it to be: 0 + $50,000 = $50,000. Now you can carry the $50,000 to the top
entry for April.
Comparing budgeted and 
actual cash receipts
Preparing a budget is one thing, but if you never look at it to see how the actual
business is behaving compared to the projections, you won’t end up making
the necessary adjustments or corrections for the next year or business period.
You want to know why the actual amounts don’t match those that were bud-
geted. Is the difference minor or significant? Is someone not doing his or her
job? Comparing the budgeted amounts to the actual amounts can help you gain
a better idea of what’s going on with the company or organization.
The quickest way to compare budgeted items with the actual amounts is to
prepare your budget with adjoining columns that show each entry. You can
also make separate columns for each month in a year’s budget, with the year-
to-date amount (the accumulated amount) in its own column. Table 15-2
shows an example expense budget with the first three months’ actual num-
bers and the accumulated total for each item.

As careful as you may try to be, errors can occur in budget entries and totals.
(You are human after all!) Amounts can (and should) be checked for accu-
racy. In Table 15-2, for instance, you can check that the year-to-date total is
correct by first adding up the columns for January, February, and March and
then by finding the sum of those three sums.
You also can do a reality check to see if the expenses are on track with what
has been budgeted. Compare the first quarter actual expenses with one-
quarter of the budgeted amount for the full year. However, remember that
this type of comparison only works when expense items stay roughly the
same each month. I further explain how to keep an eye on the accuracy of
your budget in the following sections.
Checking the addition
A good method to use when checking the addition in several columns is 
to compare the horizontal sums with the vertical ones. In a year-to-date
accounting, you already have the horizontal sums all listed in the right-most
column. After that, all you have to do is add the numbers in each vertical
column, find the sum of all those results, and then compare the sum of all the
vertical sums with the total from the right-most horizontal computation.
Here’s an example to help you better understand what I mean: Check the
year-to-date total in Table 15-2 by first adding up the expenses for the three
months given, and then find the grand total so far.
The expenses in January add up to $22,550. The totals for February and
March are $22,975 and $23,525, respectively. The sum of the expenses for
those three months is: $22,550 + $22,975 + $23,525 = $69,050. This jibes with
the sum in the last column.
211
Chapter 15: Planning for Success with Budgets

Determining whether you’re on track for the year
If expenses or income are fairly level throughout a particular time period, you
can budget accordingly and do periodic checks to see whether you’re on track.
You can check to see whether the percentage of the number of months that
have passed corresponds to the same percentage of the budgeted amounts.
(This system doesn’t work as well when amounts fluctuate significantly from
month to month.) The following example will help you understand how to per-
form this reality check.
Use Table 15-2 to determine how close the actual figures are to the budgeted
figures for the year. The year-to-date totals in the right-hand column are for
the first three months (which is the first quarter of the year). Compare each
total with one-fourth of the entire budgeted amount for the year.
All you have to do to perform this check is divide each budgeted item by 4:

The salaries and commissions are right on target — exactly what was bud-
geted. Employee benefits and telephone expenses are slightly under the bud-
geted amount. Travel and supplies are also under the budgeted amount. It’s
always nice to have expenses be less than budgeted, but the manager may be
asking why. Refer to the later section, “Measuring Differences with Variance
Analysis,” to see just what the differences may mean.
For those businesses that don’t have a relatively steady revenue or expense
stream, this check involves the different budgeted figures and their individual
percentages instead of what part of the year has passed.
Varying with a Flexible Budget
The term flexible budget doesn’t exactly represent the type of budget that it
really is. Budgets are pretty rigid. You have set numbers that are used for
goal-setting, planning, and measuring performance. A flexible budget shows
the expected behavior of costs at various levels of volume. A flexible budget
allows you to put a then after each if. For instance, you say: “If the volume is
100,000, then the income is $4,000,000.” Or you might say: “If the volume is at
60%, then the expenses are $40,000.” A flexible budget allows you some flexi-
bility in a rigid world.
Table 15-3 shows an example of a flexible budget in which various levels of
production are represented by percentages and overhead costs are repre-
sented in dollars.

The increases in each category aren’t linear. In other words, they don’t go up
by an equal amount for each percentage increase. Instead, the numbers are
usually determined by history and various formulas based on the volume.
For percent volumes not shown on the table, you can interpolate or extrapo-
late to estimate the amount in the category. Interpolation and extrapolation
are computations designed to determine a value between two given values or
to project a value outside a list of given values — based on the given pattern.
I explain each of these computations in the following sections.
Interpolating for an in-between value
As I mention earlier, Table 15-3 shows various expenses based on percent-
ages of volume. The percentages increase by 10% as the columns move from
left to right, so if you need to estimate an expense when the percentage isn’t
a multiple of ten, you use interpolation. To understand how interpolation
works, check out the following example.
Use the information in Table 15-3 to estimate the cost of labor if the produc-
tion volume is 115%.
The production volume percentage, 115%, is halfway between 110% and
120%. So you need to find the expense amount that’s halfway between the
respective amounts on the table. The labor expense at 110% is $7,920; the
expense at 120% is $8,710. To find the halfway point, you simply average the
two numbers. In other words, add the amounts together and then divide by 2.
So, first you add the amounts: $7,920 + $8,710 = $16,630. Then you divide that
sum by 2, which gives you $8,315. Now you have your labor expense at 115%.
Great work!
Not all production levels fall exactly halfway between two given values. You
may want to determine an expense that’s one-third or one-fourth of the way
between two given values.

Chapter 15: Planning for Success with Budgets

Going off the chart with extrapolation
Interpolation is usually a bit more reliable than extrapolation. Especially
when you make an estimate of a value that’s significantly greater or smaller
than any number you already have on a table, you run the chance of assum-
ing something that just can’t hold. However, sometimes you absolutely have
to find an estimate of some value outside the table. To do so, you simply set
up a proportion comparing the differences of the entries. Check out the fol-
lowing example to see what I mean.
Using Table 15-3, extrapolate the total overhead expenses if production is at
154%. Tip: The total of all expenses isn’t given in the table, but adding any
column gives you the total for that percentage.
To solve this problem, first find the total overhead expense at a production
level of 130%. Then compare the difference in percentages between 130% and
154% with the differences between expenses at 130% and 154%. The differ-
ence between 154% and 130% is 24%. Let the unknown expense be repre-
sented by x.
So the total overhead at 130% is: $3,500 + $2,400 + $3,700 + $9,585 + $4,000 =
$23,185. The decimal equivalent for 130% is 1.30, and the decimal equivalent
for 24% is 0.24. Now you’re ready for the proportion:

Budgeting Across the Months
It’s great when you can budget income or expenses week by week or month by
month without having to worry about one number intruding on the next. But
realistically, this ideal situation doesn’t necessarily happen in business. After
all, the sales that you make during one month may not show revenue until 
the next month or even later. And the inventory that you amass during one
time period may be predetermined by looking two or three months into the
future — in other words, by looking to projected sales during that future time.
Of course, you don’t create a budget using a crystal ball (but wouldn’t it be
great if you could?). Instead, you simply have to make educated projections.
And these projections are important because a good budget helps you have a
214
Part IV: Putting Math to Use in Banking and Payroll 

successful business. And creating a budget that incorporates occurrences
overlapping during the year is useful in the planning. The following sections
explain.
Using revenue budgets to deal 
with staggered income
A company may budget for a certain volume in terms of sales. In this case,
the inventory needs to be available, and the product must be paid for.
However, not all sales are paid for immediately. Some sales result in cash pay-
ments, but others are credit sales that come with the promise to pay within a
particular time period. This is where revenue budgets come into play.
A revenue budget indicates the revenue collected from sales over a period of
time. It shows the total revenue for a particular month and the ways in which
the revenue is expected to come in over time. Companies use these budgets
to calculate the amount they need to assign as revenue from sales. I show
you exactly what I mean in the following example.
Suppose a company prepares a revenue for the first four months of the year.
Historically, half of the customers pay cash (they pay upon delivery). Of the
other half, 60 percent of the credit customers pay during the month in which
they make their purchase. Thirty-eight percent of the credit customers pay
the next month, and half of those who haven’t paid in that second month
finally pay two months after the purchase. The remaining sales are consid-
ered bad debts and get written off.
If the projected sales for January, February, March, and April are $88,000,
$90,000, $96,000, and $104,000, respectively, what should the company
budget as revenue from those sales during the first four months of the year?
What amount should be written off as a bad debt? In other words, how much
does the company expect to never be paid for?
To determine the final figures, prepare a table that looks like Table 15-4,
which shows the following items:
 The projected sales for each month
 The amount collected in that month (50% of the cash sales plus 60% of
credit sales = 50% + 60%(50%) = 80%)
 The amount collected in the next month (38% of the credit sales from
the previous month = 38%(50%) = 19%)
 The final amount collected two months later (1% of the credit sales =
1%(50%) = 0.5%)
 The amount written off — the bad debt (1% of the credit sales = 
1%(50%) = 0.5%).

The amount collected in January represents 50% of the sales in cash and 60%
of the credit sales. The total comes from this math:
50%($88,000) + (60% × 50%)($88,000) =
0.50($88,000) + (0.60 × 0.50)($88,000) =
$44,000 + $26,400 = $70,400
The amount collected in February comes from three sources: 38% of the
credit sales from the previous month, 50% of the cash sales from February,
and 60% of the credit sales from February. So the total is determined like this:
(38% × 50%)($88,000) + (50% × $90,000) + (60% × 50%)$90,000 =
(0.38 × 0.50)($88,000) + (0.50 × $90,000) + (0.60 × 0.50)$90,000 =
$16,720 + $45,000 + $27,000 = $88,720
A computer spreadsheet and formulas are invaluable when setting these
budget amounts. (Refer to Chapter 5 for more on the use of computer 
spreadsheets.)
Budgeting for ample inventory
When you set a sales budget, you have high hopes for your inventory. You
probably imagine that it will fly off the shelves and result in great revenue
and, consequently, wonderful profit. But to have this type of success, you
have to have enough in stock to meet your customers’ needs. If you don’t
have the item on hand, your customer will go elsewhere.
216
Part IV: Putting Math to Use in Banking and Payroll 

It’s difficult to plan exactly what your inventory needs will be, but a good
budget based on past sales and reasonable projections goes a long way
toward keeping your inventory at its proper levels. To get some practice with
this type of planning, take a look at the following example.
Garry’s Gifts prefers to carry an ending inventory amounting to the expected
sales of the next two months. Expected sales for April, May, June, July, August,
and September are the following (respectively): $40,000, $44,000, $56,000,
$60,000, $72,000, and $66,000. If the inventory at the end of March was $84,000,
what purchases need to be made in April, May, June, and July?
Start by preparing a table showing the sales and inventory needed (use the
information given in the problem description to fill in the blanks). Table 15-5
shows you exactly what I mean. All the information given so far is included in
this table. You enter the end needs by finding the sum of the projected sales
for the next two months.

$116,000
$132,000

After you’ve created your initial table, find the purchases needed to make the
beginning inventory equal to the budgeted sales for the next two months. Fill
in the beginning inventory blanks by adding the sales for the two months
after the blank (which is the same as the end needs amount from the previ-
ous month). For example, to find the beginning inventory for May, you add
$44,000 to $56,000, which gives you $100,000. (Note: Because you don’t have
the information for October, you won’t be able to find the beginning inven-
tory for September.) Table 15-6 shows each of the beginning inventory
amounts you should have come up with.
Now add a row in the table to show the inventory at the end of the month.
(You can label this row “Net.”) The net inventory is obtained by subtracting
the sales from the beginning inventory. Then add another row for the pur-
chases that are needed to produce the needed inventory at the beginning of
the month. (Label this row “Purchases.”) Table 15-6 shows how your table
should look with all this new information. Note that you can’t fill in the last
entries for August and September without the sales information from the
months that follow.

Measuring Differences with 
Variance Analysis
Computations are made to determine the difference between budgeted
values and the actual values that occur. The results of the computations are
in the actual numbers or percentages. The numbers tell you how much of a
difference or variance there is. It’s up to you to determine the why or who (if
a department head isn’t performing as he/she should) of the variance and
just how significant the difference is in the big picture.
You’ll come across all sorts of variances when creating budgets. Revenue
variances are the differences between budgeted and actual revenues. Sales
volume variance is the difference between the actual and budgeted sales
volume. Cost variances measure differences in cost.
In the following sections, I show you exactly how to compute variances and
create a variance range that’s acceptable for your business.
Computing variance and percent variance
The variance between the budgeted estimate and the actual value is the
number or dollar amount difference between what was anticipated and what
actually happened. Numerically, variances can be positive or negative, mean-
ing that they can have either a positive or negative impact on your bottom
line. For instance, a negative variance is a good thing if you’re talking about
expenses (you spent less than expected), but a negative variance isn’t so
good when you’re talking about income.
218
Part IV: Putting Math to Use in Banking and Payroll 

A better way to measure variances than with actual numbers is by using per-
centages. Why? Well, consider this: A difference of $10,000 is huge if the bud-
geted amount is $20,000, but a $10,000 variance doesn’t have all that much
impact if the budgeted amount is several million dollars.
Whether you’re dealing with actual numbers or percentages, you always sub-
tract the actual amount from the budgeted amount. You get a negative result
if the actual number is larger than the budgeted number and a positive result
if the actual number is smaller than the budgeted number.
Here’s an example you can work for practice: Say that Suds and Stuff Enterprises
budgeted $300,000 for production expenses, $200,000 for overhead, 150,000
units of production, and 450 visitors for April. The actual figures were $350,000
for production expenses, $250,000 for overhead, 200,000 units of production,
and 200 visitors. What’s the variance and percent variance for each item?
To work this problem, make a table showing the items (budgeted and actual),
the variance, and the percent variance. To get the variance, you simply sub-
tract the actual from the budgeted. To get the percent variance, divide the
variance (which you got by subtracting) by the budgeted amount. (Percent
differences — percent increases and decreases — are covered in Chapter 3 if
you need a refresher course.) Table 15-7 shows you what your table should
look like with all the information filled in.

expenses, overhead, and production units are the same number, the percent-
ages are actually quite different.

Chapter 15: Planning for Success with Budgets

Finding a range for variance
Making a budget is a matter of best guesses, good computations, and a bit
of luck. Some differences are tolerable, but others may be too far off to be
acceptable and run a good business. In order to monitor your variances with-
out going nuts with anxiety, you can simply set a particular maximum differ-
ence or variance. That way you only have to be concerned when the
difference is more than that maximum difference.
A budget is just a plan, and you’re no crystal ball-gazer, so you don’t really
expect to be right on the penny with actual figures. You should expect to be
a little above or below the budgeted amount when the final figures come in.
How much of a difference is reasonable or acceptable? Businesses set a toler-
ance or range of values that they expect the actual values to fall into when
the final numbers are tallied. For example, you may say that the revenues for
April will be $40,000, plus or minus $2,000. So your range is from $38,000 to
$42,000. As long as the actual numbers fall in that range, you don’t really
need to take another look at the revenue-producing units in the business.
Try out this example: Say that Best Builders has set a budget for the third
quarter of the year and has determined that a 5% variance (up or down) on
budgeted items is acceptable. Anything greater than 5% needs to be exam-
ined. The budgeted items for the third quarter are
 1,000 units of raw material purchased
 800 units of raw material put into process
 500 hours of labor in production
 400 hours of indirect labor
 $4,000 indirect costs
 $6.00 standard price of one unit of raw material
Determine the acceptable amounts for each unit if 5% variance is acceptable.
To accomplish this, find 5% of each item. Then subtract and add the 5%
amount from the budgeted amount to determine the acceptable range.
Table 15-8 shows the computations and results.

Dealing with Payroll
In This Chapter
 Figuring employee earnings
 Deducting taxes, insurance, and other withheld expenses
P
ayday can come monthly, bimonthly, weekly, or even daily, depending on
your business’s chosen pay schedule. On the other hand, some royalty
payments for books or movies come only twice a year. And with some con-
tract jobs, an employee gets paid only after finishing an entire project. In any
case, monetary payment involves more than just the gross pay amount that a
job is worth. After subtracting taxes, Social Security contributions, insurance,
and whatever else appears in the deductions list, the net pay usually doesn’t
much resemble the lofty income figure.
In this chapter, you find multiple ways of figuring earnings. The main pay-
ment types you have to choose from are salaries, hourly paychecks, and com-
missioned payments. Salaried employees usually get a set fraction of the total
amount each pay period. Hourly workers are paid according to the time put
in during that pay period. Commissioned employees, on the other hand, usu-
ally are all paid differently. The variations on commission payments are
many, and some can be rather creative.
Also important in this chapter are those pesky deductions. Figuring the
amount to subtract from the base pay varies from deduction to deduction.
Some deductions are percentages of the gross pay, and others are flat
amounts. Some federally mandated deductions have caps or limits to the
amount that can be deducted; others don’t. You see a lot of multiplying and
subtracting (unfortunately, lots of subtracting) in this chapter on how to
determine net or take-home pay.

Pay Up: Calculating Employee Earnings
Earnings from being gainfully employed are accumulated in many ways.
Here’s a rundown of the types of employees and how they earn their pay:
 Salaried employees: These folks earn a set amount of money per year,
and the amount is divided evenly between the number of pay periods.
Salaried employees sometimes earn extra pay for extracurricular activi-
ties, or they may receive end-of-year bonuses.
 Seasonal or part-year salaried employees: These employees may opt to
take their salaries over the entire 12 months, or they may choose to be
paid just during the 3 months or 9 months that they work.
 Hourly employees: The hourly worker is paid a set rate per hour, but
there’s often the opportunity to work overtime at a higher rate.
 Commissioned employees: A commissioned employee is paid based on
some performance. They aren’t paid according to the number of hours
worked, however. Instead, they’re paid according to income activity or
production. Salespersons are frequently paid on a commission basis; a
base pay may be included and added to the commissions earned. One
variation on a flat percentage rate of commission is having built-in
increases for meeting certain levels of production.
Determining the earnings for all these folks may sound daunting, but don’t
worry. The following sections show you exactly what you need to know to
calculate all four types of earnings.
Dividing to determine a timely paycheck
To find out how much a person working for a set salary should earn each pay
period, you simply have to use your division skills. You also have to determine
how often you plan to pay your employees. Most employers pay monthly,
bimonthly, or weekly. You can find pros and cons for each of these payment
arrangements. Check out this list to get an idea of each arrangement:
 Monthly: Paying monthly means issuing paychecks 12 times each year.
Most bills come monthly as well, so monthly payments make budgeting
and keeping track of bills much easier. The downside to monthly pay-
ments is that the months don’t have the same number of days, so
payday comes on different days of the week. Also, for some employees,
a month between paychecks may seem like a really long time.
 Bimonthly: Bimonthly paychecks provide fresh cash to employees more
frequently, but it also means more bookkeeping for the employer.
224
Part IV: Putting Math to Use in Banking and Payroll 

 Weekly: Paying weekly allows for more frequent paychecks on the same
day of the week, which is good for the employee. But, like bimonthly
checks, this arrangement can be a bookkeeping nightmare for the
employer. A bonus for employees on this payment plan: Four months
each year have five pay periods.
Don’t forget that even though salaried employees receive a set amount each
pay period, they also may be eligible for extra pay or bonuses that are added
to just one or a few paychecks.
Try your hand at calculating the amount of a monthly paycheck with this
example: Sandy is a manager of Save-A-Bunch, and she has been a wonderful
employee for the store this year. Sandy filled in for a sick evening manager for
six weeks (in addition to her regular job), and she was paid extra for the
added responsibility. She’s also eligible for a bonus at the end of the year.
Using the following information, determine the amount that Sandy is paid
each month: Sandy’s yearly salary is $47,700, and her bonus, which she
receives in December, is $6,000. She was paid $3,600 for taking on the extra
work for six weeks. The extra work covered all of November and half of
December.
To determine Sandy’s monthly paycheck amount, first find her gross base
pay by dividing $47,700 by 12, which gives you $3,975 per month. In
November, Sandy gets extra earnings for the additional evening work. So
divide the extra amount she was paid by the number of weeks she worked to
get the amount per week: $3,600 ÷ 6 = $600.
Now, multiply that $600 by 4 (the number of weeks in November) to deter-
mine her extra November payment: $600 × 4 = $2,400. To calculate her total
November paycheck, simply add her gross base pay with the extra cash:
$3,975 + $2,400 = $6,375.
Don’t forget that in December Sandy gets two more $600 payments totaling
$1,200 plus the bonus. So her December paycheck is $3,975 + $1,200 + $6,000
= $11,175. Merry Christmas, Sandy!
Now try the following example, which has a bit of a twist on interim work.
Mike is a professor at a local university. He has an opportunity to teach a
summer interim course for extra pay. The arrangement with the university is
that extra compensation is paid at the rate of 7% of a person’s base salary for
each three-credit course. Mike currently makes $63,000 per year, and the
course is a four-credit course. How much will he be paid to teach during the
interim?
225
Chapter 16: Dealing with Payroll

Sounds like a toughie doesn’t it? Don’t worry; it really isn’t that bad. First,
determine the percentage rate for a four-credit course. Use a proportion that
has the number of credits in the left-hand fraction and the percentages in the
right-hand fraction. (Refer to Chapter 4 if you need a review of setting up pro-
portions.) Let x represent the unknown percentage. Cross-multiply and solve
for x. Here’s what your math should look like:

So Mike will be paid 9.33% of his salary. To figure out how much he’ll be paid
to teach the interim course, simply multiply his current salary by the per-
centage (in decimal form), like this: $63,000 × 0.0933 ≈$5,878.
Part-timers: Computing the salary 
of seasonal and temporary workers
Seasonal or temporary workers may be employed for a few weeks, a few
months, or a major portion of the year. And depending on what type of work-
ers they are, they’re paid differently. Seasonal workers, for instance, are usu-
ally paid a salary during the months that they work. Others, such as
temporary workers, who typically work for nine or ten months each year,
may opt to be paid equal amounts each month, every month of the year.
Suppose Clyde retired from a management position with a large heavy-
equipment manufacturing company. Now he does consulting with the com-
pany and works for eight months each year. He can choose to be paid
monthly during those eight months, or he can even out his payment and be
paid each of the 12 months for that 8 months’ work. Clyde is being paid
$4,500 per month for his consulting. How much would he get per month if he
chooses the 12-month plan?
First find the total amount Clyde receives for his work by multiplying the pay-
ment per month by the number of months he works: $4,500 × 8 = $36,000.
Now, you just have to divide that total by 12 to find out how much he’ll be
paid per month: $36,000 ÷ 12 = $3,000.
Determining an hourly wage
Being paid an hourly rate means that for every hour that an employee works,
she’s paid a set amount — and if she doesn’t work, she isn’t paid. Sounds
pretty simple, but be careful; you can find contingencies and arrangements
226
Part IV: Putting Math to Use in Banking and Payroll 

that make one hourly wage different from another. I explain some arrange-
ments in the following sections.
Working with an adjustable hourly rate
Businesses often choose an adjustable hourly rate for their employees. With
this arrangement, the rates eventually change with the number of months or
years of employment. In other words, employees are rewarded for their con-
tinued loyalty with wage increases.
Hourly rates are adjusted according to some prescribed formula. The formula
may add a set number of dollars after a particular amount of time, or the for-
mula may incorporate a percentage increase.
Say that Pete’s Produce has four hourly workers on staff; each of these
employees works 35 hours per week. Pete’s pays an hourly rate of $8.00 for
starting workers, and it increases the rate by $0.50 cents per hour after the
worker has worked at the market for 6 months. Workers who have been with
Pete’s for a year or more get an increase of $0.10 cents for every 6 months
they have been employed after the first 6 months. How much do Amy and
Ben each make at Pete’s if Amy has been employed for two years and Ben for 
six years?
First, determine Amy’s hourly rate. At the end of her first year, she was earn-
ing: $8.50 + $0.10 = $8.60 per hour. Add two more increases, and Amy’s rate is
$8.60 + $0.10 + $0.10 = $8.80 per hour.
Ben has been employed at Pete’s for six years, so his rate is: $8.50 + $0.10 +
$0.10 + $0.10 + $0.10 + $0.10 + $0.10 + $0.10 + $0.10 + $0.10 + $0.10 + $0.10 =
$9.60 per hour.
What if Ben had been there for 10 years or 15 years? Don’t you think there’s a
better way to figure out his rate than adding up all those $0.10-cent addi-
tions? Well, sure! You could use the following formula:

where n is the number of months and the fraction in the [[ ]] is rounded

The greatest integer function takes a number and rounds it down to the largest
integer that’s smaller than the number. For instance, performing the greatest

So, in effect, the greatest integer function just lops off any fraction or decimal
part of a positive mixed number.
Choosing an hourly rate with an overtime option
Another arrangement you may choose for your business is an hourly rate
with the option of overtime. With this option, after a certain number of hours
each week, overtime rates kick in. These rates increase the amount per hour
an employee earns for the hours worked in overtime. Being paid overtime is
a nice perk for hourly workers. However, it’s both a blessing and a bane; you
get paid at a higher rate, but you do have to work more hours.
The overtime rate is usually either a set amount that’s greater than the
employee’s usual rate, or it’s a percentage increase. You have to determine
which rate works best — especially considering how large a percentage
increase will be for employees earning at the top of the rate scale.
Check out this example: A local fast-food restaurant pays its employees $7.50
per hour for the first 40 hours, time-and-a-half for the next 10 hours, and
double-time for hours exceeding 50 hours during any one week. How much
do Ronald and Donald make if Ronald works 48 hours and Donald works 63
hours during a one-week period?
At $7.50 per hour, time-and-a-half is $7.50 × 1.5 = $11.25, and double time is
$7.50 × 2 = $15. Given this information, you can see that Ronald earns $7.50
for the first 40 hours and $11.25 for the next 8 hours (48 – 40 = 8 hours). So
Ronald earns ($7.50 × 40) + ($11.25 × 8) = $300 + $90 = $390.
Donald, on the other hand, earns $7.50 for the first 40 hours, $11.25 for the
next 10 hours (50 – 40 = 10 hours), and $15 for the last 13 hours (63 – 50 = 13).
So Donald makes ($7.50 × 40) + ($11.25 × 10) + ($15.00 × 13) = $300 + $112.50 +
$195 = $607.50.
Taking care of commission payments
Working on a commission means that an employee earns a percentage of
some sales or activity. This type of arrangement is usually set up to reward
hard work and good salesmanship. Imagine the car salesperson, for example;
the more cars he sells, the more he earns.
Commission structures vary. The commission rates may be flat, single rates,
or graduated as the total sales increase. A base pay may also be included.
And managers sometimes earn commissions based on their salespersons’
efforts. I explain each of these structures in the upcoming sections.
228
Part IV: Putting Math to Use in Banking and Payroll 

Keeping an even keel with a flat commission rate
A flat commission rate is one that stays the same no matter how much or how
little a person produces in sales. The commission — or payment to the sales-
person — is a percentage of the total amount of revenue brought in by the
salesperson.
To compute the amount of commission earned by a salesperson, you multi-
ply the total amount of the sale or sales by the decimal number correspond-
ing to the commission percentage. If the commission rate is 10%, for instance,
sales of $10,000 earn the salesperson $10,000 × 0.10 = $1,000. A commission
acts as an incentive to sell more. With a flat percentage of sales, a salesper-
son gets the same commission for selling one $100,000 piece of jewelry as she
does for selling five $20,000 pieces.
Ready for an example? Take a look at this one: Carole works in a local shoe
store and earns a commission of 6% on all the products that she sells. During
the five days that she worked last week, she sold 211 pairs of shoes for a total
of $8,239.37 in gross sales. What’s her commission?
To find Carole’s commission, simply multiply her gross sales by her commis-
sion percentage (in decimal form): $8,239.37 × 0.06 ≈$494.36.
Graduating to a graduated commission schedule
A graduated commission schedule rewards the salesperson for the magnitude
of their sales. For instance, as the total in sales increases, the commission
rate increases as well. Depending on the arrangement, the increase either
applies to the sales over a certain number or to all the sales that have accu-
mulated over a time period.
For example, a person’s commission rate may be 5% on the first $10,000 in
sales, 10% on the next $40,000 in sales, and 15% on all sales over $50,000. Or,
the arrangement may be that the salesperson earns 5% on all sales up to
$10,000, 10% on all sales if they sell up to $50,000, and 15% on all sales if they
sell more than $50,000. In each case, you multiply the sales that qualify for a
particular rate by the decimal corresponding to the percentage.
Try your hand at this example: Imagine that Carole has worked in a local
shoe store for several years and is negotiating a better commission rate for
herself — as a condition of her staying with that store. Carole suggests to her
boss that a suitable weekly commission rate would be one of the following:
6% commission on the first $5,000 in sales and 10% on all sales exceeding
$5,000
6% commission on the first $5,000 in sales; if her total sales exceed
$5,000, she receives an 8% commission on all of her sales
229
Chapter 16: Dealing with Payroll

If Carole typically sells about $8,500 in shoes each week, which commission
rate is better for her?
Using the first rate, which is 6% on the first $5,000 and 10% on the next $3,500
($8,500 – $5,000 = $3,500), Carole earns ($5,000 × 0.06) + ($3,500 × 0.10) = $300
+ $350 = $650.
Using the second rate, where she gets 8% commission on the total when she
exceeds $5,000, Carole earns $8,500 × 0.08 = $680. So, she does better with the
second rate.
Refer to the previous problem where Carole is negotiating a new commission
rate. In that problem, Carole makes $8,500 and is better off taking 8% for her
entire commission (rather than 6% on the first $5,000 and 10% on the sales
exceeding $5,000). How much does she need to sell each week for the first
commission schedule to be better?
To find out, construct an equation in which the commission paid at the first
rate (6% on the first $5,000 and 10% on any sales more than $5,000) is equal
to the second rate (8% on all sales when she exceeds $5,000). Let the amount
in sales be represented by x. Your equation and math should look like this:

As you can see, if Carole starts selling more than $10,000 each week, she’s
better off with the first rate. For instance, if Carole sells $11,000 during the
week, the first commission rate earns her $5,000 × 0.06 + $6,000 × 0.10 = $300
+ $600 = $900.
Using the $11,000 sales figure and the second rate, where she gets 8% on the
total amount, she earns $11,000 × 0.08 = $880.
Combining a base salary and a commission
Many businesses pay their salespersons a small base salary to be in the
store, on the lot, or out in the field, and then they add on a commission to
reward for volume of sales. This arrangement of base pay plus commission
works best when it’s necessary that someone is available to customers
whether or not sales are made. Of course, the business doesn’t want to pay
someone who just stands around and doesn’t try to sell anything. But the
base pay serves to compensate the salesperson for some of his time.
230
Part IV: Putting Math to Use in Banking and Payroll 

To compute the total payment for this type of arrangement, you determine
how much the person earns in commission fees by multiplying the sales total
by the percentage. Then you add the commission to the base salary for that
time period.
A cutlery company sells its products through home visits and catalogue sales
only. The compensation arrangement is that salespersons receive $15 per
sales presentation and 10% of the gross sales. Salespersons also get $5 for
each customer referral they obtain during a sales presentation. What does a
salesperson earn during a week when he makes 20 sales presentations,
obtains 35 referrals, and sells $3,500 in products?
To calculate the salesperson’s compensation, multiply the 20 presentations
by $15, multiply the 35 referrals by $5, multiply the $3,500 by 10%, and then
add the three results together: (20 × $15) + (35 × $5) + ($3,500 × 0.10) = $300 +
$175 + $350 = $825.
Splitting a commission
Splitting a commission occurs when two or more people share in the commis-
sion earned for a particular sale or sales. Salespersons work under this
arrangement when it’s to the mutual benefit of all those involved to share in
the payment. Splitting the money with someone who helped accomplish the
transaction is better than getting nothing. After all, the sale couldn’t have
happened otherwise. You see the commission-splitting arrangement in real
estate and other high-priced items such as yachts.
When it comes to real estate, different areas of the country have different
arrangements for commissions, but the basic premise is that the listing agent
(the person who contracts with a seller to sell her property), the selling
agent (the person who finds a buyer and sells the property), and any man-
agers and support staff all have a claim to part of the total commission.
The share in a split commission is really just a percent of a percent. You mul-
tiply the amount of the sale by the commission rate (changed to a decimal
value) by the share of the commission (changed to a decimal value).
Try this real estate problem to get an idea of how you can calculate payments
when splits are involved: Say, for example, that in Springfield, the standard
commission on a home sale is 7%. Of that percentage, half goes to the selling
agent’s company and half to the listing agent’s company. Now say that in a
particular transaction, where a home sells for $230,000, both the selling and
listing agents work for the same company. The arrangement with that com-
pany is that 20% of all commissions go to the office manager and 15% go to
office expenses; the rest go to the agents. What do the selling and listing
agents earn for this transaction?
231
Chapter 16: Dealing with Payroll

First, find the total commission, which is 7% of the selling price of the home:
0.07 × $230,000 = $16,100. Now determine the manager’s share of the commis-
sion and the office expenses share of the commission. The manager’s share is
20% of the commission: 0.20 × $16,000 = $3,220. The office expenses amount,
which is 15% of the commission, is: 0.15 × $16,000 = $2,415. The next step is
to subtract the manager and office expense amounts from the total commis-
sion: $16,100 – ($3,220 + $2,415) = $10,465. Finally, you can split what’s left for
the agents. Splitting this difference two ways, each agent gets $5,232.50 for
the transaction.
Subtracting Payroll Deductions
Reality hits home each time an employee receives a paycheck. Why? Because
before the check is cut, all sorts of pesky deductions are subtracted from the
earnings. Deductions are made before the paycheck is issued perhaps to
make the process less painful, or maybe to be sure that the payments are
made to the insurance company, the federal government, and the other
taxing bodies.
Depending on the deduction, the subtraction is either a percent of the total
income, a percent of the taxable income, a set monthly amount, or an occa-
sional debit. Each deduction has its effect to the income before there’s any
outgo.
Computing federal income tax
The federal income tax was authorized in 1913 with the passage of the 16th
Amendment. And ever since that time, April 15 — tax day — has come to
hold special meaning for most Americans.
The rate for federal income tax is a graduated amount going as high as 35
percent of a person’s taxable income. The expression taxable income has
been interpreted and reinterpreted — and likely will be interpreted yet again.
What this term refers to is the amount of your income that Uncle Sam can
tax. However, you also get to disallow some of your income to be subject to
the tax. You just have to keep up with the changes and rules for these adjust-
ments and plan accordingly.
Figuring income tax on taxable income
An employee’s taxable income is arrived at after doing all the computations
and manipulations necessary on their income tax form. They subtract deduc-
tions and exemptions and come up with as small a number as possible to
multiply by the percentage rate. (Well, you do this, don’t you? Am I the only
232
Part IV: Putting Math to Use in Banking and Payroll 

one who scrapes the barrel for deductions?) The rates used in the multiplica-
tion depend on the employee’s status (single, head of household, married)
and how much taxable income he has. Worksheets for employers and
employees help determine how much should be deducted from their pay-
check to pay their federal, state, and/or local income tax.
Be sure to use a tax computation worksheet carefully and accurately. 
You don’t want to take out too much of a deduction, because no interest is
earned on the money (even though it’s refunded later). And you don’t want 
to take out too little money, because penalties are charged for significant 
underpayment.
Calculating corporate rates
Most corporations pay income tax at rates varying from 15% to 39% of their
taxable income. After the tax rate is determined (by looking at the total
income for the corporation), the income tax rate then applies to the entire
income amount. This is unlike the personal income tax rate in which a lower
rate is applied to the first few thousand dollars, a higher rate applied to the
next few thousand, and so on. Corporations pay the same high rate for the
entire amount of their income. For instance, look at these rates:
If the taxable income is . . . 
The tax rate is . . .
$0–$50,000
15%
$50,001–$75,000
25%
$100,001–$335,000
39%
$335,001–$10,000,000
34%
To calculate the tax amount, multiply the total income by the decimal value
corresponding to the percentage rate.
Using the previous table of rates, determine the difference in income tax paid
by a corporation whose taxable income is $330,000 and one whose taxable
income is $340,000.
To do so, multiply the taxable incomes by their respective tax rates:
$330,000 × 39% = $128,700
$340,000 × 34% = $115,600
The corporation that makes $10,000 more in taxable income pays about
$13,000 less in taxes.
233
Chapter 16: Dealing with Payroll

Determining Social Security contributions
The FICA tax, which is named after the Federal Insurance Contributions Act,
consists of both Social Security and Medicare taxes. Social Security taxes 
and Medicare taxes are paid partly by the employee and partly by the
employer — each pays half of the total contribution.
The Social Security part of the tax has an upper limit — the employee pays
tax on his or her income only up to a certain level. In 2007, for example, the
top amount being taxed was $97,500; so the cap for taxes was 6.2% of $97,500,
or $6,045. The Medicare part of the FICA tax has no cap. All earnings are sub-
ject to the 1.45% tax rate for Medicare.
So, in 2007, an employee may have had Social Security contributions of up to
$12,090 (half contributed by the employee and half contributed by the
employer) and no limit on the Medicare contribution, which would equal 2.9%
of the income (half paid by the employee and half paid by the employer).
Try your hand at an example for a bit of practice. Say that an employee earns
$4,400 in taxable income each month. Using the 2007 rates that I mention ear-
lier, determine how much is deducted for Social Security and Medicare during
the month of November.
To solve this problem, first determine whether the employee has reached or
passed the upper level of making Social Security contributions. If you multi-
ply $4,400 by the first ten months (which gives you $44,000), you see that the
total is nowhere near the $97,500 cap. So the full contribution to Social
Security will be made, which means you have to multiply the employee’s tax-
able income by the percentage cap to find the amount that will be deducted:
$4,400 × 6.2% = $272.80.
This amount is deducted from the employee’s paycheck, and the business
contributes another $272.80. The Medicare contribution in this scenario is
1.45% of $4,400, which comes out to be $63.80. The company matches that
amount, too.

A

has to purchase or produce the items, set a price
that earns a profit, sell the items, and then report the
profit for possible taxation. In addition to these processes,
the businesses have to figure discounts and markups and
overhead and depreciation. Plus, it pays to keep good

very day radio, television, and newspaper ads bombard customers with
wonderful opportunities to spend money. Customers may sometimes feel
that it’s difficult to separate the good from the bad with these retail opportu-
nities. And for the merchant, pricing can be both a science and art. It’s neces-
sary to mark up items to earn a reasonable profit and cover costs, but prices
that are too high lead to lower sales. On the flip side, discounting items can
bring in more customers. However, too deep a slash can hurt the company’s
bottom line.
Keeping track of all these price changes can be tricky. So you need to be
familiar and comfortable with percents, decimals, and fractions. Being famil-
iar with these will help you catch obvious errors — and save money.
In this chapter, you discover how to determine markups, discounts, and the
general game plans for establishing the new prices of items. New prices are
most frequently determined by using fractions and percents in such situa-
tions as having a half-off sale or giving customers 60% off of every orange-dot
item. (If you’re feeling percentage anxious, check out Chapter 3, where you
find the basics of percent increase and percent decrease.)
Examining Markups and Retail Prices
The amount of money that a store pays for merchandise is always less than
the price that customers pay. It’s a known fact that items are marked up 
from a wholesale price to a retail price. Likewise, a company that provides
services may hire a contractor at one amount and mark up the cost of the
contractor’s work to the end customer. All of this markup is done in the name

of profit. In the following sections, I explain everything you need to know in
order to deal with markups and retail prices.
This section shows you how to work back and forth from the cost of an item
to the price that’s charged. To help ease your way, I use cost when talking
about what the merchant or service provider pays and price for what the cus-
tomer pays. Because markups are based on the price and profits involve both
the price and cost, I use the two different words to keep things straight.
Making sense of markups
Unless you’ve been living in a bubble and have never ventured out to the
store, you’ve had experience with markups. All companies mark up their
prices in order to make a profit. The markup of an item for sale is the amount
of money the retailer adds to the cost of the item to bring it up to the selling
price. This price is also often referred to as the retail price (though for pur-
poses of this book, I only refer to it as selling price). Here’s an equation to
help you understand this process:
Cost + Markup in dollars = Selling price
Try putting this equation to work with an example.
If the cost of an item is $50 and the selling (retail) price is $90, what’s the
markup?
To solve this problem, all you have to do is plug the numbers into the equa-
tion, which gives you $50 + markup = $90. Using basic algebra, you can see
that the markup is $40.
If the markup of an item is $27.50 and the selling price is $90, what’s the cost
of the item?
To solve, plug your numbers into the equation, like so: cost + $27.50 = $90.
After the algebra is hashed out, the cost comes to $62.50.
Understanding how markups are 
a percentage of retail prices
Sometimes you may want to figure the markup percentage of an item. For
instance, you may be doing some comparison shopping for equipment for
your small business. You find the same item at two different stores for two
different prices. You assume that the cost to the merchants was the same, so
you figure out what the markup is at each store. Knowing the markup that 
a merchant is using helps you decide where to shop. When a markup 
238
Part V: Successfully Handling the Math Used in the World of Goods and Services

percentage is computed, it’s based on the retail price, not the wholesale cost.
After you find the markup percentage, you can also then find the markup in 
dollars. I explain how to compute both in the following sections.
Figuring the markup as a percent
If you know the markup and the retail price of an item, you can figure the
markup percentage. (You find information on cost, markup, and retail price in
the earlier section, “Making sense of markups.”) If you know the retail price
and markup percentage, you can figure the markup and the cost of the item.
In other words, the cost, markup, markup percentage, and retail price are all
intertwined.
Here’s the formula showing how to compute the markup percentage:
markup percentage
retail price in dollars
dollar amount of markup
=
Here’s an example to help you get accustomed to the markup percentage
equation: Say that a refrigerator sells for $750. The markup is $250. What’s
the markup percentage for the refrigerator?
To solve this example, divide the markup amount by the retail price. Here’s
what the math would look like:
.
. . .
750
250
3
1
0 333
=
=
So you have about a 331⁄3% markup.
Calculating the markup in dollars
The markup in dollars is an important calculation, because after you know it,
you can determine the cost of the item to the retailer. Here’s the formula:
Markup in dollars = Markup percentage × Retail price in dollars
Suppose a car sells for $23,000 and the markup is 5.5%. What’s the dollar
amount of the markup? After you figure the markup in dollars, determine how
much the dealer paid for the car.
To solve, simply plug the numbers into the formula, like so:
Markup in dollars = 5.5% × $23,000 = 0.055 × $23,000
= $1,265
Now you can figure out how much the dealer paid for the car. To do so, use
this formula:
Retail price – Markup in dollars = Amount dealer paid
239
Chapter 17: Pricing with Markups and Discounts

So, simply plug in your numbers to get the amount paid: $23,000 – $1,265 =
$21,735.
Working with the retail price
The process of determining the retail price of an item is somewhat backward
from what you may expect. As I note earlier in this chapter, the markup is a
percentage of the retail price, so how in the world can you determine the
retail price from the markup percentage or the retail price from the cost of
the item if you need a percentage of that retail price? It does sound like a
conundrum, but the situation really isn’t as bad as it sounds. I provide you
with a formula to use when determining the retail price.
Finding the retail price
If you know the cost and markup of an item, you can determine the retail
price of the item using the following formula:
retail price
1
markup percentage
dollar cost of item
100%
markup percentage
cost of item
=
-
=
-
Recall that 100% is the same as the number 1. (Chapter 2 shows you how to
change percentages to decimal numbers.)
Here’s an example for you to try out: Say that it costs you $45 in materials
and labor to produce a pair of beaded moccasins. You plan on a 40% markup.
What will you charge for the moccasins?
To solve, simply plug the numbers into the formula. Your equation should
look like this:

As you can see, you need to sell the moccasins for $75 if you want a 40%
markup.
You may be asking: “Isn’t that the same thing I’d get by finding 40% of $45 and
then adding that percentage to the $45?” Nope, and this is the perfect oppor-
tunity to show you why not! After all, take a look at this: If you find 40% of
$45, you get 0.40 × $45 = $18. Add $18 to $45, and the sum is $63. This isn’t
anywhere near the $75 price that was determined properly.
Take a look at another example: What’s the retail price of an appliance if the
markup dollar amount is $50 and the markup percentage is 25%?
240
Part V: Successfully Handling the Math Used in the World of Goods and Services

For this problem, use the following formula:
Markup amount in dollars = Markup percentage × Retail price
Substituting in what you know, you get $50 = 25% × retail price. Now divide
each side by 25% to solve for the retail price. Your equation should look like
this:

25% of the $200 retail price.
Figuring out the cost of the item
The cost of an item is what the retailer pays a supplier or what a manufac-
turer charges for all the materials and labor. If certain parts of your billing
information aren’t available, you can still determine the cost of an item based
on the other information that you do have.
Determining cost from retail price and markup
Suppose that you have retail price and markup information. You can defi-
nitely determine cost with this information. To do so, play around with the
following formula:
Cost + Markup in dollars = Retail price
Check out the following example to see what I mean.
Say that a desk lamp (which would be perfect in your office) has a price tag
of $930. The markup on lamps is 60%. What did the lamp cost the supplier?
To solve, you need to determine the markup amount in dollars before substi-
tuting into the retail price in dollars formula, which looks like this:
Retail price in dollars = Dollar cost of item + Markup amount in dollars
To find the markup amount in dollars, you use this formula:
Markup amount in dollars = Markup percentage × Retail amount
When you fill your numbers into the markup amount in dollars formula, your
equation will look like this: 60% × $930 = $558. Next you go ahead and plug
into the retail price in dollars formula to get this: $930 = cost of item + $558.
Finally, subtract $558 from each side of the equation to get the cost of the
lamp, which is $372.

Determining cost after an increase
Imagine that you’re trying to determine this year’s cost of an item based on
last year’s information, because you want to do an increase in volume this
year. This calculation is a bit more complex than the one in the previous sec-
tion, but it’s fairly simple in small steps.
To calculate cost in this situation, all you have to do is determine the actual
money amount of the increase based on the percent increase. If you’re start-
ing with the retail percent increase, you compute the cost using the appropri-
ate formula. If you’re starting with the actual cost, you’re home free — you
just have to compute the percent increase. (Chapter 3 provides information
on percent increases and decreases if you need a refresher.)
Wrap your brain around this concept with an example: Last year, you did
$20,000 volume at retail for one particular item in your inventory. This year,
you plan to increase your retail volume of this item by 20%. If your markup
percentage is 50%, how much will your cost be for this item? After you find
the new retail volume, determine how much this will cost and how much
more your cost will be this year than it was last year.
First determine what your retail volume will be, factoring in the 20% increase.
Twenty percent of $20,000 is $4,000, so you plan on a volume of $24,000. Now
you can use the formula for determining retail price from cost, and then solve
for the cost. Here’s what the equation should look like:
retail price
100%
markup percentage
cost of item
$24,000

After multiplying each side of the equation by 0.50, you get that the cost will
be $12,000. How much more is your cost of this item than last year? Well, if
you did $20,000 and your markup is 50%, the markup amount was 0.50 ×
$20,000 = $10,000. So you’re planning spending an additional $2,000 on the
item this year.
Exploring Discount Pricing
Consumers are attracted to opportunities to save money, and merchants
need to keep older inventory moving out the door to make room for shiny
new goodies. So you may want to take advantage of this situation and put a
sign in the window showing that all items are discounted by 40 percent. You
may have a rush on your hands — or so you hope. It all depends on how the
discount is computed.
242
Part V: Successfully Handling the Math Used in the World of Goods and Services

For example, sometimes discounts are computed at the cash register, letting
the technology do the work. But customers are more often attracted to items
when they see the actual marked-down price on the tag. However, you may
run into some problems when showing the actual marked-down price. One
problem is that you have to change all the tags back to the original price
when the sale is over. Also, you may have a customer who questions the
math, and then you need to be able to defend the number — gently and diplo-
matically, of course. In the following sections, I explain the many ways to 
discount products.
Discounting once
You can probably guess what the formula for discount price is, but here it is
just in case:
Discount price = Original retail price – Amount of the discount
When the discount is a certain dollar amount, you simply subtract that
amount to get the new price. More commonly, though, the discount price is
based on a percentage of the original price of the item.
Subtracting a dollar amount discount from the price
Discounting the price of an item means that you subtract the discounted
amount from the full retail price. Unless you sell just one type of item or ser-
vice, the amount of the discount usually varies from item to item. After all, it
wouldn’t make much sense to advertise $100 off all items if the merchandise
currently varies in price from $1,000 to $200. You may run across some
instance where a blanket discount makes sense — the $200 item at $100 off
could be your cost leader, for example — but, in general, different items have
different discounts.
Suppose a $4,500 big-screen television is going on sale at a 20% discount.
What’s the new price of the television?
To work this example, you have to find 20% of $4,500. You can do so with the
following equation (refer to Chapter 2 to see how to change percentages to
decimals): 0.20 × $4,500 = $900. The discount is $900, so now you subtract
that amount from the original retail price for the discounted price of the tele-
vision: $4,500 – $900 = $3,600.
The math is fine and worked well for this example, but what if you have to
figure the discount prices of more than 100 items in your store? This method
of multiplying each price by 20% and then subtracting the discount from the
original retail price is a bit cumbersome. If you have a bunch of items that
need discounted, you may be better off using a one-step process. The method
shown in the next section makes much more sense when you have many dis-
count prices to figure.
243
Chapter 17: Pricing with Markups and Discounts

Multiplying by the net percentage
If you have to find the discount prices of many items, the previous option of
doing each computation individually could take days. But don’t worry. You
have another option. With this option, you multiply by the net percentage,
which is done in one step instead of with the two-step process of figuring the
discount and then subtracting.
The net percentage is the difference between 100% (the full retail price 
percentage) and the discount percentage. Look at this computation of the
discount price in terms of percentages of the discount, the original price, and
the new price:
New, discounted price = Original retail price (100%) – Discount 
(% of original)
Let x represent the original retail price, and you get
New, discounted price = x(100%) – x(Discount % of original)
To make the equation even simpler, you pull the x out of each term on the
right and multiply it by the difference. You get the discounted price by 
multiplying the original retail price by the difference between 100% and the
discount percent of the original retail price, like this:
x(100% – Discount % of original)
The value in the parentheses is the net percentage. So, if the discount is 40%,
the equation for the new, discounted price is:
New, discounted price = x(100% – 40%)
= x(60%)
Try this example: Merchandise currently priced at $430, $670, $550, and $375
is to be discounted by 30%. Find the new prices for each.
First, find the percentage multiplier by subtracting 100% – 30% = 70%.
Seventy percent has a decimal equivalence of 0.70. Now just plug the num-
bers into the equation, like so:
$430(0.70) = $301
$670(0.70) = $469
$550(0.70) = $385
$375(0.70) = $262.50
Note that the prices found by multiplying by 70% are the same that you’d get
by multiplying the original price by 30% and subtracting the product from
that original. For instance, 30% of $430 is worked like this: $430(0.30) = $129.
244
Part V: Successfully Handling the Math Used in the World of Goods and Services

Then for the subtraction: $430 – $129 = $301. As you can see, you get the
same answer with less hassle.
Computations like the ones in the previous example are even easier to do
with a spreadsheet. With a spreadsheet you can enter the original prices and
a formula to do the multiplication. Chapter 5 has more on using spreadsheets
for repeated calculations.
Successive or multiple discounts
Sometimes a discounted price is discounted again (and again). You can com-
pute a final discounted price that’s the result of more than one discount by
determining the price from the first discount and then by discounting the dis-
count price. This process can be repeated as many times as you want. Or you
can also apply a quick formula to the original price and do the discounting in
one fell swoop.
If you’re running a sale campaign and will be discounting your discount over
the period of days or weeks, you’ll want all the gory details — all the dis-
counted prices in steps. See the upcoming section, “Performing successive
discounting,” for details regarding this situation. However, if you’re after the
bottom line and want the best and final discount, check out the later section,
“Using a formula for multiple discounts.” You’ll save time and energy with
this method.
Performing successive discounting
If a store is going out of business or a charity sale needs to reduce its inven-
tory by the end of the weekend, successive discounts are made over a period
of time. The multiple or successive discounts are each made on the already-
discounted price. For example, here are the formulas:
Original price – Amount of first discount = First intermediate price
First intermediate price – Amount of second discount = Second 
intermediate price
Second intermediate price – Amount of third discount = Third 
intermediate price
This method can go on and on as many times as you need.
Ready for an example? Check this one out: Julep’s Closet is a large fundraiser
held every year at which gently used donated items are sold over a four-day
period. On the first day, all items are sold at full price. On the second day, all
items are discounted by 10%. On the third day, the remaining items are dis-
counted by another 30%. And, on the final day, everything that’s left is dis-
counted by 60%. What’s the final price of a coat that was unsold on the last
day, if the original price was $60?
245
Chapter 17: Pricing with Markups and Discounts

Did you notice that the discounts all add up to 100%? Does that mean that the
final price is $0? No, of course not. Here’s how the math goes:
Original price – Amount of first discount = First intermediate price
$60 – 10%($60) = $60 – 0.10($60) = $60 – $6 = $54
First intermediate price – Amount of second discount = Second 
intermediate price
$54 – 30%($54) = $54 – 0.30($54) = $54 – $16.20 = $37.80
Second intermediate price – Amount of third discount = Third 
intermediate price
$37.80 – 60%($37.80) = $37.80 – 0.60($37.80) = $37.80 – $22.68 = $15.12
The final price of the coat on the final day of the sale is just over $15.
Now look at the computations using the same percentages on the same coat,
but instead of subtracting the amount of the discount each time, use the net
percentage (check out the earlier section, “Multiplying by the net percent-
age,” for more details). The net percentage is found by subtracting the dis-
count percentage from 100%. So, using the information from the example, you
get the following net percentages:
100% – 10% = 90%
100% – 30% = 70%
100% – 60% = 40%.
Then you simply fill in the formulas:
Original price × Net percentage of first discount = First intermediate
price
$60 × 0.90 = $54
First intermediate price × Net percentage of second discount = Second
intermediate price
$54 × 0.70 = $37.80
Second intermediate price × Net percentage of third discount = Third
intermediate price
$37.80 × 0.40 = $15.12
Using a formula for multiple discounts
If you’re going to figure a discount of a discount price, and you’re in a huge
hurry, you can skip the method of successive discounts as shown in the pre-
vious section and simply apply a single formula to get the end result — quick,
fast, and in a hurry.
246
Part V: Successfully Handling the Math Used in the World of Goods and Services

Here’s how the formula works: Consider an item costing $100 that’s first dis-
counted by 10% and then discounted by 20%. The net percentages are 90%
and 80%, respectively. Your corresponding decimals are 0.90 and 0.80.
Now you simply multiply the two net percentages together and then multiply
the resulting product by the original retail price. For example, your math
would look something like this:
0.90 × 0.80 = 0.72
$100 × 0.72 = $72
Try your hand at this example: In the earlier section, “Performing successive
discounting,” a $60 coat was discounted by 10%, 30%, and finally 60%. Using
the easier formula that I discuss in this section, determine the final price.
Multiply the net percentages (90%, 70%, and 40%, respectively) together, like
so: 0.90 × 0.70 × 0.40 = 0.252. Now multiply the original $60 by 0.252 and you
get $15.12.
Going for a volume discount
Businesses are often granted a nice reduction in the price of items purchased
if they place larger orders for the item or items. In the world of advertising,
newspapers and magazines usually discount the price when more lines of
advertising are purchased or a larger number of advertisements are con-
tracted for over the period of a year or more.
The discount for buying a larger number of items may apply to all the items
purchased, or it may apply just to the items over a certain number. Some dis-
counts could even be retroactive; for instance, you may pay full price and
then, when a certain level of purchasing is reached during some time period,
the discount is applied to later purchases and you get a rebate on earlier pur-
chases. You may decide that you need to determine discounts like these, so
read on for details.
Discounting the entire order
To grasp the concept of discounting on an entire order, say that a retail sup-
plier provides widgets to several stores in the area. Widgets cost the retailer
$4.00 each. If a single order is for more than 300 but less than 500 widgets,
the cost per widget for the entire order is $3.80. If the order is for 500 or more
widgets, the cost is $3.50 per widget. Look at this pricing using a piecewise
function, where n is the number of items ordered:

Chapter 17: Pricing with Markups and Discounts

A piecewise function is a rule that changes with input volume or amounts.
You use piecewise functions to accommodate volume purchases; you build in
the discount pricing. Utilities, for example, use piecewise functions where the
input is the number of units of electricity or water. The Internal Revenue
Service uses piecewise functions where the income is the input and the tax
percentage increases with the income.
What’s the cost of an order of 470 widgets? How much is saved by ordering
all 470 widgets at once, instead of ordering 200 one month and 270 the next
month?
An order of 470 widgets allows the retailer to use the middle pricing scheme
in the formula (piecewise function) for determining the total price. You
simply have to plug in the numbers to get the price of the order of 470 
widgets: $3.80 × 470 = $1,786.
If the retailer had ordered 470 widgets in two smaller orders, necessitating
using the more expensive pricing, the math would be different: $4.00 ×
200 + $4.00 × 270 = $1,880. You can calculate the savings like this: $1,880 –
$1,786 = $94.
Paying in graduated amounts
To better understand the logistics of paying in graduated amounts, check out
this example: Suppose a supplier of canned chicken feet (a delicacy in
Taiwan) has a pricing scale based on the number of cans bought by a mer-
chant. For instance, if the merchant purchases more than 1,000 cans, the cost
per can for all those after the first 1,000 is $0.85. The first 1,000 cans cost
$0.97 each. If the merchant purchases more than 2,000 cans, the cost per can
for all those after 2,000 cans is $0.60.
Now suppose that a specialty food shop orders 5,000 cans of chicken feet
from the supplier whose pricing formula is shown here:

In the formula, n represents the number of cans ordered. The second line of
the formula — $970 + $0.85 × (n – 1,000) if 1,000 < n ≤2,000 — incorporates
the cost of the first 1,000 cans at $0.97 by multiplying 1,000 × $0.97. Then it
subtracts those 1,000 cans from n and multiplies the difference by the lower
cost per can. The same process is used in the third line of the formula: The
$1,820 comes from adding $970 for the first 1,000 cans plus $850 for the
second 1,000 cans.
Knowing all that information, can you determine what an order of 5,000 cans
of chicken feet will cost?
248
Part V: Successfully Handling the Math Used in the World of Goods and Services

Because the order is for 5,000 cans, you use the third line of the formula. Your
math should look like this:
Cost = $1,820 + $0.60(5,000 – 2,000)
= $1,820 + $0.60(3,000)
= $1,820 + $1,800
= $3,620
By dividing $3,620 by 5,000, you get an average of about $0.72 cents per can.
Getting a retroactive discount
The best way to get a handle on retroactive discounting is to work through an
example. So check out the following scenario.
The supplier of a popular bubble gum charges $15 per box for 24 packs of
gum. After a retailer has ordered 1,000 boxes of gum in one calendar year, the
rest of the boxes of gum cost $14.70 — and the price is retroactive for all pur-
chases that year. Say, for example, that one retailer places orders for 300, 400,
and 500 boxes of gum. That retailer paid full price for the first two orders.
What’s the charge for the third order?
The third order puts the retailer over the 1,000 target, because 300 + 400 +
500 = 1,200. The retailer owes $14.70 per box for the last order of 500 boxes,
which comes to $14.70 × 500 = $7,350. The retailer now gets a retroactive dis-
count on the first 700 boxes. The retailer paid $15 per case, but it now gets a
discount of $0.30 per case retroactively. Here’s what the equation would look
like: 700 × $0.30 = $210. Now subtract the $210 from the retailer’s current bill
of $7,350 to find out what he owes: $7,350 – $210 = $7,140.
Taking advantage of discounts for lines and pages of advertising
Newspapers and other periodicals would like for you to be a regular adver-
tiser, so discounts are offered depending on how much advertising space you
use each year. You may sign a contract so that the discount is in effect from
the beginning of the year. Other times, though, you may just pay as you go
because you don’t know how much of a regular customer you’ll be. The dis-
count, of course, is the way to go.
Say, for example, that a newspaper charges $1.00 per line for advertising in
the classified section. If you contract for 5,000 lines per year, you get a 10%
discount; 10,000 lines per year earns a 12% discount; and 20,000 lines per
year gets a 15% discount. What’s the total cost of advertising if you contract
for 18,000 lines per year?
Contracting for 18,000 lines puts you at the 12% discount level. The net per-
centage cost per line is 100% – 12% = 88%, or $0.88. To get the total cost of
advertising, your math would look like this: 18,000 × 0.88 = $15,840.
249
Chapter 17: Pricing with Markups and Discounts

Notice how close you are to the next level of discount. If you increase your
contract for just 2,000 more lines, you’d be at the 15% discount level. Will it
cost you more or less total advertising money to contract for 20,000 lines?
A 15% discount means the net percentage is 85%. Now multiply to get the
total cost of advertising: 20,000 × 0.85 = $17,000. If you subtract the two sets
of advertising costs ($17,000 – $15,840 = $1,160), you can see that the cost of
the extra 2,000 lines is an increase of $1,160 over what you originally planned
to spend. The advertising cost goes up by about 7.3% (divide $1,160 by
$15,840) when you add the additional 2,000 lines, but the amount of advertis-
ing space increases by about 11% (divide 2,000 by 18,000). It may be worth
the added cost to change the contract. (If you need help with percent
increases, refer to Chapter 3.)

Discount Cards
Many local supermarkets, pharmacies, and
other retail stores want you to sign up for their
free discount cards. The cards are used to iden-
tify and reward loyal and frequent customers by
giving discounts on select items. But they really
do beg the question: Do you really save money?
Or do the stores simply increase the prices in
general so that the discount really just brings
the price down to what it would have been with-
out a card?
The savvy consumer checks out the prices.
Consider a curious shopper who wants to deter-
mine whether the discount card really is worth
the hassle. This shopper purchases about 20
particular items (just normal, weekly purchases)
at the store with the discount card. Then the
shopper buys the same 20 items at a store that
offers a discount card (but the shopper doesn’t
have that card). Finally, the shopper buys the
same 20 items at a store that doesn’t offer a dis-
count card at all.
So, the shopper now has three weeks’ worth of
purchases, but he’s set for almost a month.
What do you suppose the shopper determines?
Without naming any names, places, or stores, I
do declare that the shopper pays the least at the
store that doesn’t offer the discount card at all.
You don’t believe me? Try it. Do I have a discount
card? Sure, but that isn’t what draws me to that
particular store for certain purchases.

Calculating Profit, 
Revenue, and Cost
In This Chapter
 Balancing revenue and cost for a profit
 Discovering costs and how to predict them
 Breaking even in business
T
he basic idea of making a profit on a venture comes early to young
people. Maybe you had a lemonade stand out in front of your house, sell-
ing cups of that sweet stuff to the passing neighbors? Or maybe you were
involved in organizations or camps that had you fundraising by selling items
such as cookies, popcorn, or candy. And if you weren’t lucky enough to be
involved in any of those activities, there were always the school supply sales
run by the student council or the football game concession stands run by the
glee club. The point is that most people have had an opportunity to see
profit, revenue, and cost at work in a firsthand situation before they even set
foot into the business world.
The general concept of profit is fairly straightforward and relatively easy to
understand. A profit is simply the difference between the amount of money
you receive for goods and the amount it costs you to produce them. What
makes the process of determining profit all the more interesting is when you
begin to break down the costs into the different types and then investigate
the different ways that the costs are handled. This investigation is a far cry
from the lemonade stand where you added up how much the lemons, sugar,
and cups cost.
Coming out ahead is a definite (and pretty obvious) goal for the business-
person. And, before you get ahead, you have to break even. In other words,
you want to earn at least what you’re spending. You want to reach the break-
even level of sales and exceed it by as much as possible. Determining the
break-even point involves getting a handle on the revenue and the costs —
and doing the appropriate computations. In this chapter, you discover the
basis of profit, revenue, cost, and breaking even — and how they all work
together for you.

Figuring Profit from Revenue and Cost
Profit is a good thing. It’s what makes businesses run, become successful,
and grow. In order to earn a profit, you have to have fewer expenses than you
do income. Your cost of providing merchandise or a service has to be less
than what you’re paid to provide the goods or service.
Here’s the general formula relating profit, revenue, and cost:
Profit = Revenue – Cost
Understanding how volume affects 
profit, revenue, and cost
One of the simpler models or examples of profit, revenue, and cost is driven
completely by the volume — the number of items produced and sold. In this
model, the number of items produced and sold is the variable. The price
being charged for an item and the cost to produce an item are constant num-
bers. This simple model doesn’t really apply to big, complicated businesses,
but it holds for some of the basic ventures.
For instance, if you can produce lemonade for $0.12 per cup — which
includes the cost of the materials and the paper cup — and if you sell the
lemonade for $0.50 per cup, this equation gives you your profit, P, when you
sell x cups of lemonade:
P(x) = 0.50x – 0.12x
= 0.38x
The notation P(x) in the profit equation is called function notation. The nota-
tion P(x) reads: P of x, where x is the input amount used to evaluate the equa-
tion, P, to get an answer.
The variable x represents the number of items, so in the revenue part of the
equation it’s the price multiplied by x. In the cost part of the equation, it’s the
cost per item multiplied by x. The difference is found with algebraic subtraction.
Continuing with the lemonade stand scenario, try out this example: What’s
the profit on 100 cups of lemonade if it costs you $0.12 for the materials per
cup and you can sell the lemonade for $0.50 per cup? Also, how many cups of
lemonade do you have to sell to make a profit of $50?
Using the formula P(x) = 0.50x – 0.12x, you get P(x) = 0.38x. If you let x = 100,
you put the 100 in for the value of x, multiply 0.38 by 100 to get: P(100) =
0.38(100) = 38. So you make $38 for selling 100 cups of lemonade.
252
Part V: Successfully Handling the Math Used in the World of Goods and Services

To determine how many cups of lemonade you need to sell to make a $50
profit, you replace P(x) in the formula with 50, and then you solve for x, the
number of cups. So your equation looks like this: 50 = 0.38x.
Now you divide both sides of the equation by 0.38 to get about 131.6. You
aren’t going to sell anyone a part of a cup of lemonade, so round up to 132
cups. Using the formula, you get P(132) = 0.38(132) = 50.16. This amount
exceeds $50, but if you use 131 in the formula instead, you get: P(131) =
0.38(131) = 49.78. Of course, this is under the target amount.
Seeing how price is sensitive to demand
Many people are bargain hunters. They shop around until they find the best
price for a particular item; some even wait until an item goes on sale before
buying it. The merchant, on the other hand, wants to be competitive in pric-
ing, but it also wants to make as much as the market will bear.
A common characteristic of price in relation to the number of items sold is
this: the lower the price, the more the items tend to sell. It takes a fine bal-
ance, of course, between lowering or raising prices enough but not too much.
The following sections show you how to find that balance.
Charting the effects of lowering prices
A merchant can make use of an informal customer survey or perhaps the tal-
ents of a marketing firm to determine how to price an item. Also factored into
setting the price is the cost to produce the item.
For example, say that a company usually sells 2,400 doodads a month when
the price is $15 per doodad. The company determines that it can increase the
number of doodads sold by 400 for each $0.50 drop in price. Table 18-1 illus-
trates the effect of this drop in price on the number of doodads sold.

2,400 + 400(4) = 4,000
5
15 – 0.50(5) = 12.50
2,400 + 400(5) = 4,400

Chapter 18: Calculating Profit, Revenue, and Cost

The information in Table 18-1 is informative when it comes to determining the
effects of lowering prices, but an equation is even more helpful. Why?
Because it can be written into a spreadsheet, graphed, and worked into equa-
tions to analyze the situation. Read on to the next section to discover this
helpful equation.
Using an equation for demand
A demand equation is used to represent the effect of a drop in price. Demand
equations are projections or predictions of what the sales volume will be
based on the price or what the price should be based on estimated sales
volume. These equations are produced by marketing analysts who study
sales numbers and create models in the forms of formulas. A demand func-
tion is used instead of a set, unchanging price in the revenue part of a profit
function. For example, instead of saying that the revenue is R = 10x, meaning
that each item will sell for $10, you use the revenue function R = px, showing
that the price, p, changes with the volume, x.
Consider the situation in the previous section where a company determines
that it can increase the number of doodads sold by 400 for each drop of $0.50
in price. In that situation, the following demand equation can be used:

where x is the number of items expected to be sold if the price is p. Because a

being sold, x, you solve the equation for p like this:

These values are the same that you find in Table 18-1.
You can see from the demand equation that there’s a limit on what x can be.
For instance, if you let x be a number greater than 14,400, you get a negative
price. You can specify that the equation applies only to volume within a cer-
tain range. You may say that x must be less than 1 million or between 100 and
500, or some such constraints. Such guidelines are set to keep the price
above a particular number so that the profit is a positive number.
The following example shows you how to use a demand equation to find a
profit. Suppose that doodads sell for $15 regularly, but the company’s market-
ing division has determined that doodads sell better if the price is reduced.
The demand function that reflects an additional 400 sales for each $0.50
reduction is
,
p
x
800

where p is the price when x doodads are sold. Constructing a doodad costs
the company $8.50. What’s the profit when the company sells 2,400 doodads?
How about when it sells 3,600 doodads and 5,200 doodads?
To figure this problem, you simply use the profit equation (Profit = Revenue –
Cost). You can fill in the revenue part of the formula by multiplying the price
per doodad, p, by the number of items, x. Then you subtract the cost, 8.50x.
Your equation looks like this: P = px – 8.50x. Now insert the demand equation
for the p:

The profit equation can be simplified with algebra, but I’m just going to leave
it for now to show the substitutions for x. I’ll let x = 2,400, 3,600, and 5,200.

From these equations, you can see that the profit increases when the number
of doodads sold goes from 2,400 to 3,600. Remember that the doodads cost
$15 when 2,400 are sold. When 3,600 doodads are sold, you know that the
price has been reduced to $13.50 each. But what happened with the sales
level of 5,200? Shouldn’t increased sales mean more profit? Nope! That’s not
the case when the price has been reduced too much. When 5,200 doodads
are sold, the demand equation says that the price has been lowered to
$11.50. The lower price has offset the increased sales.

Chapter 18: Calculating Profit, Revenue, and Cost

Sorting out variable and fixed costs
You can find two basic types of cost in production or services: fixed cost and
variable cost. Fixed cost is the part of the total cost that’s incurred whether
you produce anything or not. Fixed cost may be for the use of a building or
structure, payments to any salaried employees, insurance, and so on. In sim-
pler models, the fixed cost is the start-up cost. This type of cost is incurred
once no matter how many items are produced. For example, when you decide
to sell imprinted T-shirts for a sports team, your start-up cost is for the
screen-print template, which you pay for only once.
The variable cost is the part of the total cost that changes as the number of
items being produced changes. When it comes to variable cost, the more
items you produce, the more you have in cost.
With a lemonade stand, for example, the more cups of lemonade you put
together to sell, the more it costs in sugar, lemons, and paper cups. With
large companies, on the other hand, the cost may vary in another way: The
amount charged per item may decrease (or the profit margin may increase).
Why is this the case? Well, when supplies are bought in large quantities, dis-
counts for volume can make the expenditure per item smaller.
Figuring in fixed cost
The fixed cost of a small enterprise, such as the sale of fundraiser T-shirts or
a stall at a flea market, is a set number that counts against the profit no
matter how many items are sold. In a way, the fixed cost is the risk for being
in a venture. You pay it whether you sell anything or not.
When including fixed cost in the profit formula, you add the fixed amount to
the variable amount. Here are the formulas you may use:
Total Cost = Variable cost + Fixed cost
Total Cost = Price × number of items + Constant number
Try your hand at this problem: The booster club for the Bradley Braves
decided to fashion a commemorative T-shirt to celebrate the team’s success
in the NCAA basketball tournament. The template for the screen printing
costs $90. The T-shirts themselves cost $8 each, but it also costs $2 per shirt
to get them printed. The booster club decides to sell the T-shirts for $12
each. What’s the club’s profit if it sells 300 T-shirts?
First you have to find the total cost for the T-shirts. This total includes both
the variable and fixed costs. Start with the variable costs: $8 per shirt plus 
$2 per shirt for printing. So your total variable cost is $10 per shirt. In the
cost formula, this variable part of the total cost is $10x, where x is the
number of T-shirts. The fixed cost is $90. So the total cost is written like this:
C(x) = 10x + 90.
256
Part V: Successfully Handling the Math Used in the World of Goods and Services

The revenue part of the profit equation is written as 12x, because the shirts
will be sold for $12 each. By putting the revenue and cost portions into the
profit equation and simplifying, you get
P(x) = 12x – (10x + 90)
= 12x – 10x – 90
= 2x – 90
Now replace the x in the equation with 300, which is the amount the club
anticipates to sell. This gives you
P(x) = 2(300) – 90
= 600 – 90
= 510
So the club will make $510 if it sells 300 T-shirts.
Notice that the club is in trouble if it doesn’t sell at least 45 T-shirts. With fixed
costs of $90, the club members need to sell at least $90 worth of T-shirts so
they don’t have a negative result in the profit formula. You solve for the
number of items needed to break even by setting the profit function equal to 0
and solving for the variable. In this case, P(x) = 0 when 2x–90 = 0. You get 2x =
90, or x = 45.
Here’s another example to get you up to speed: A plant food manufacturer
has expenses involving mixing, packaging, and the monthly rent for the
equipment. Rather than buy the machinery, the manufacturer pays $2,000 per
month to rent the equipment needed to process the plant food. The manufac-
turer also pays $12,000 to produce 5,000 gallons of plant food. The plant food
is mixed with water immediately before being packaged in 8-ounce bottles.
During this packaging process, which costs $6,000, the manufacturer adds
4,000 gallons of water to the plant food. The 8-ounce bottles sell for $2.29
each. What profit function is used to determine the profit if the manufacturer
sells 10,000 bottles of plant food in one month?
To find out, use the profit equation. The revenue part of this equation is easy:
You simply multiply $2.29 by x, where x is the number of bottles. The cost
consists of the fixed part, $2,000 per month, and the variable part, which is
the amount it costs to produce each bottle of food. To determine the cost per
bottle, first figure out how many 8-ounce bottles are filled with the 5,000 gal-
lons of plant food plus 4,000 gallons of water. Tip: One gallon = 4 quarts = 16
cups = 128 ounces; one cup = 8 ounces.
If you add the plant food and water, you get 9,000 gallons of fluid that fills the
8-ounce bottles. An 8-ounce bottle holds a cup of fluid, and 1 gallon is the
same as 16 cups, so multiply the number of gallons by 16. You get 9,000 × 16 =
144,000 bottles. It costs $12,000 to produce the plant food and $6,000 to 
257
Chapter 18: Calculating Profit, Revenue, and Cost

package the bottles, so a total of $18,000 is needed. To find the cost per
bottle, divide $18,000 by 144,000 to get 0.125, or 121⁄2 cents per bottle.
The profit function is written by subtracting the cost from the revenue. So for
the plant food, your function looks like this:
P(x) = 2.29x – (0.125x + 2,000)
= 2.29x – 0.125x – 2000
= 2.165x – 2000
So the profit on 10,000 bottles in one month is
P(10,000) = 2.165(10,000) – 2000
= 21,650 – 2000 = 19,650
A $19,650 profit is a pretty decent one. Looks like a lot of money can be made
in feeding plants.
Examining how variable costs change with volume
The simplest method of figuring the cost of the materials and labor that are
needed to produce an item is to take the total amount expended in materials
and labor and divide it by the number of items. This computation gives you a
fixed value that’s then used in a profit function as the cost per item.
For example, if you determine that it costs $40 per item to produce a particu-
lar product, you use the number 40 as a multiplier of the variable that repre-
sents the number of items. In the profit equation, you can use something like
40x for the cost to show that each item of the x number of items produced is
multiplied by the individual cost.
Sometimes, though, the costs change with the number of items being pro-
duced. For instance, when a company buys supplies in bulk, it often gets a
discount, which reduces the amount spent per item. This changing cost is
represented by a function or relationship in the form of an equation. You
start with the usual cost, such as $40 per item, and then subtract some
amount as a reward for doing volume business.
For example, the $40 cost per item could be reduced by the fraction 0.0003 of
a dollar, for every item you purchase. You could use this equation for the
cost, c, per item: c = 40 – 0.0003x.
The greater the number of items, the less the cost. Why? Because something
is always being subtracted from the base cost (in this case 40). With this par-
ticular example equation, not much is subtracted (unless x is fairly large).
But the numbers can eventually make a difference, and it may be necessary
to put a cap or limit on the amount that can be subtracted. And remember,
the reduced price applies to all the items purchased.
258
Part V: Successfully Handling the Math Used in the World of Goods and Services

Ready for an example? Try this one: Suppose a ceramic business makes deco-
rative jack-o’-lanterns every year and sells them for $55 each. The kiln-firing
process during which all the jack-o’-lanterns are prepared costs $100 in elec-
tricity. Let’s just say that the materials needed — clay and glazes — have a
cost per item according to the equation c = 40 – 0.0003x, because the supplier
rewards volume spending. What’s the total cost for x jack-o’-lanterns, and
what’s the profit if the business makes 100 of these decorations?
To solve this problem, remember that the total cost equals the variable cost
plus the fixed cost. And the variable cost is the cost per jack-o’-lantern multi-
plied by the number of jack-o’-lanterns, x. So the variable cost is represented
with cx. But you replace the c with 40 – 0.0003x to get:
cx = (40 – 0.0003x)x
= 40x – 0.0003x2
Now add the fixed cost of $100 to get the total cost for x jack-o’-lanterns: 
40x – 0.0003x2 + 100.
Great work! To find the profit that the business makes producing and selling
100 items, write the revenue as 55x and then subtract the cost. The profit is
represented with this equation:
P(x) = 55x – (40x – 0.0003x2 + 100)
= 55x – 40x + 0.0003x2 – 100
= 15x – 0.0003x2 – 100
To find the profit on 100 jack-o’-lanterns, replace the x with 100, like so:
P(100) = 15(100) + 0.0003(100)2 – 100
= 1,500 + 3 – 100 = 1,403
So, as you can see, the company makes over $1,400 on the jack-o’-lanterns.
A cost-adjusting or changing formula like the one shown in this example usu-
ally has some range of values for which it can be used. If the number of items
gets too large, the cost can become very small or even negative — which
makes no sense. The supplier will have a chart or formula telling you the
range of number of items that apply to the discount. For example, the sup-
plier may say that the discount doesn’t start until you’ve ordered at least 100
items and doesn’t apply to orders exceeding 10,000 items. It’s their call.
Averaging the costs
One measure of how profits act is the average cost of the items produced.
Here’s the general formula to find the average cost:
Average cost = Total cost ÷ Number of items
259
Chapter 18: Calculating Profit, Revenue, and Cost

So, for example, if the total cost of an item is $4,000, and you’ve produced
1,000 items, the average cost is $4 per item. Not too difficult, is it?
Good. Now, I want to give you an example of a legitimate cost function where
the following apply:
The average cost per item when 50 items are produced is $24.
The average cost per item when 100 items are produced is $14.
The average cost per item when 200 items are produced is $9.
This is no magic trick. This example is an illustration of how the fixed cost
factors into the total cost. It also shows that the greater the number of items
produced, the more items there are to spread the fixed costs to.
Here’s the math that corresponds to the numbers I gave: C(x) = 4x + 1,000. In
this cost equation, the variable cost is represented with 4x, where x is the
number of items. It costs $4 per item for materials and/or labor. The fixed
cost is $1,000. When 50 items are produced, the $1,000 is divided evenly
among the 50 items, each absorbing $20 of the fixed cost plus the $4. When
100 items are produced, each takes on $10 of the fixed cost plus $4. And
when 200 items are produced, each has $5 of the fixed cost plus $4. As you
see, the more items that are produced, the lower the average cost per item.
What’s It Gonna Be? Projecting Cost
When determining a company’s profit, you use a formula that subtracts cost
from revenue. This formula gives you the net value — which you hope is a
positive number. Determining the revenue for this formula is relatively easy;
the money comes in or promises are made, and this allows you to record the
income for the products or service. Cost, on the other hand, is often a bit
more elusive to predict than revenue. After all, you have to juggle many dif-
ferent types of costs, including
 Fixed and variable costs (see the previous section for details)
 Direct and indirect costs
 Differential and historical costs
The projected cost (what you estimate you’ll have to provide to suppliers,
labor force, and utility companies) is necessary when trying to determine a
workable price to put in the revenue part of the profit equation. (See the ear-
lier section, “Figuring Profit from Revenue and Cost,” for more details on the
profit equation.) Depending on your type of business, you generally break the
various costs into smaller components or different categories. The many
260
Part V: Successfully Handling the Math Used in the World of Goods and Services

types of costs are often handled differently in the overall accounting
processes. But the basic types, which I cover in the following sections, do
have many similarities.
Dividing up direct and indirect costs
Direct cost includes anything that can be specifically traceable or accountable
to a particular product, service, or purpose. Here are some examples of
direct costs:
 The materials needed to construct a house
 The labor used to install a fence
 The advertising bought to announce a bake sale
Indirect cost involves (surprise, surprise) costs that aren’t directly traceable
or accountable to a particular product or service. Instead, indirect cost may
be associated with two or more different products or services of a company
or business. The following are some examples of indirect cost:
 The cost of advertising for the different sale items in a store
 Salaries of managers and secretaries not directly involved in the produc-
tion process
 Stationery and office supplies
 Insurance
 Heating and cooling
The list goes on and on. Just remember that the indirect costs get allocated
to different items based on an overhead rate. An overhead rate is designed to
assign a fair amount of the indirect costs to particular products based on
some measures or amounts associated with the different products.
For example, an overhead rate may include the number of hours of labor for
the different products, the number of hours of machine time, or even the
level of direct costs. Each of these measures can then be used to determine
how much of the indirect cost will be allocated to a particular product. The
labor costs and amount of machine time are still assigned to the different
products responsible as direct costs. The share of labor costs and machine
time can be converted to percentages and used to assign or apportion the
indirect costs to the different products in a fair and equitable manner.
If one product uses half of all the machine time, it could be assigned half of all
the indirect costs. Formulas for assigning the indirect costs may vary, but
they all revolve around divvying up percentages of the indirect cost so that
the percentages all add up to 100%.
261
Chapter 18: Calculating Profit, Revenue, and Cost

Try this example: Consider a company that makes four different products: 
A, B, C, and D. Here are the percentage breakdowns of each product:
Product A requires 10% of the labor and 20% of the machinery time, and
it accounts for 20% of the total of all the direct costs.
Product B requires 30% of the labor and 20% machine time, and it
accounts for 40% of the direct costs.
Product C uses 50% of the labor and 30% of the machine time, and it
accounts for 20% of the direct costs.
Product D requires 10% of the labor and 30% of the machine time, and it
accounts for 20% of the direct costs.
The total amount in indirect costs per year is $2,500,000. How much of the
indirect cost should be assigned to each product? (Tip: When solving,
assume that each category is equally weighted; in other words, machine time
doesn’t count more than labor.)
To find out how to assign the indirect costs, first add up all the percentages.
Doing so will give you 300%. To get the fraction of the indirect costs that each
product is responsible for, add up the percentages assigned to each product
and divide by 300%. Refer to Table 18-2 for an organized approach to the math.

Whoa! What in the world are those fractions doing there? They all have differ-
ent denominators. How do you check to see if they add up correctly (to 1 or
100%)? It’s easy! To add fractions together, simply find a common denomina-
tor for the fractions, change each fraction to an equivalent fraction with that
denominator, and then add the numerators together and simplify. (Flip to
Chapter 2 for more on fractions.) Here’s what your work should look like:

If you prefer not to work with fractions, you can do the computations using
the percentages directly from the table. For each product, first you multiply
$2,500,000 by its total percentage (without moving the decimal). Then you
divide the result by 300. You’ll be dealing with very large numbers, but your
calculator should be able to take the heat for you. However, take heed: I
really prefer not to work with such big numbers. It’s way too easy to get lost
in all those zeros.
Weighing historical and differential cost
When determining how to price an item, you look at how much that item
costs to produce. Well, you at least look at the item’s production cost 
history — what it has been costing to produce it. Making plans for future pro-
duction and sales, you look into the future for what it will cost you to con-
tinue the same process. Historical cost is what the cost has been in the past.
Differential cost is what you predict the cost to be in the future.
Historical cost may be based on last month’s or last year’s figures. However,
you may even go back several years to see if the cost of an item is holding
steady. Usually, the cost of production increases over time. But on rare occa-
sions, the cost may decrease because of some glut in the necessary materials
or because of a change in technology. So when predicting profits and setting
prices, you must use historical cost judiciously.
Differential cost is determined somewhat by changes in circumstances, and
it’s a prediction of what amount is necessary due to inflation, specification
changes, availability of materials, or agreement with labor. Determining differ-
ential cost may seem somewhat like looking in a crystal ball. But don’t worry;
to make the process a bit more manageable and to provide a sense of secu-
rity with the results, some tools are available to assist you in the process.
For instance, you can develop a formula or equation using the high-low
method or the method of least squares. You can draw a line through a scatter
plot and determine the equation of the line to use as the cost formula. Many
calculators and spreadsheets give you pretty decent formulas, too, if you
plug in the information you have at hand.

Chapter 18: Calculating Profit, Revenue, and Cost

Assuming a pattern in costs
One of the most prevalent assumptions in determining cost is that it will be
linear and therefore follow a straight line. Except for a few little deviations,
the increases (or decreases) in this cost assumption appear to follow a line
that’s upward or downward or fairly level — both in a picture or with a for-
mula. A linear function is a frequently-used model in business and accounting.
Another assumption in cost behavior is that cost moves in steps. The step 
function, for instance, is horizontal or level until another expense, such as a new
worker, is added. At that point, the cost jumps up and stays horizontal again
until another addition comes along. The resulting graph looks like stair steps.
Figure 18-1 shows you a linear model on the left and a step function on the right.
The last of the more popular assumptions is that cost follows a curve.
However, the differences between a curve and a line are often so small that a
line, which is easier to deal with, is usually satisfactory for approximations.
Linear cost assumptions top users’ lists of function types because they’re
easier to write equations for, easier to deal with once the formula is written,
and because, frequently, this is just how cost behaves. Complex cost formu-
las are created with technology — computers and calculators. You’ll find that
you can usually get by with the cost assumptions involving linearity, as
shown in the following sections.
Developing a formula for a linear cost assumption
Using either historical or differential figures, the models or formulas for the
cost of production based on the volume are found in several different ways.
Your goal here is to write the equation of a linear function C(x) = a + bx,
where C is the total cost, a is the fixed cost for some time period, and bx is
the variable cost (see the earlier section, “Sorting out variable and fixed
costs,” for more). The variable b represents the cost per unit, and x repre-
sents the number of units or volume of production.

The linear cost model is based on the slope-intercept form for the equation of
a line. In algebra, you’re presented with y = mx+b, where m is the slope of the
line (the way the line changes when x changes) and b is the y-intercept or ini-
tial value — it stays constant like the fixed cost.
To determine the values of a and b in the cost equation, C(x) = a + bx, your
computation options include the following:
 Applying the high-low method to make a scatter plot of the actual costs
 Drawing a line through the points on a scatter plot
 Using the method of least squares
 Using just one year’s or one month’s worth of cost figures — one set of
data — when that’s all there is.
I explain how to use each of these options in the following sections.
Finding a decent cost equation is a matter of choice, judgment, and luck. You
make the choice as to the method to use, you decide whether your resulting
choice is reasonable, and, if you’re lucky, the model will work for you when
doing computations now and business in the future.
Picking one representative value
If you’ve been in business for one year and anticipate that the cost of produc-
tion isn’t going to change, you’ll probably use the fixed cost and cost per unit
that you did last year to predict profit. The following example explains how.
Say, for instance, that a college club prepares goodie boxes for final exam
time. The club sends notes to the parents of all students offering to prepare a
box (on behalf of the paying parent) of healthy snacks, hot cocoa mix, coffee
and tea, instant macaroni and cheese, crackers, and other goodies to help the
student through final exams. Last year, the club was able to buy a box and fill
it with goodies for $7.39 per box. The mailing and postage costs (stationery,
printing, and stamps) came to a total of $473. Every parent got a letter, but
not everyone ordered a goodie box. Using the figures from last year, how
much will the group spend if it gets orders for 330 boxes this year?
To figure out the total expenses for this number of goodie boxes, you have to
take into account the fixed and variable costs, which will be placed into the
cost equation I introduce in the previous section: C(x) = a + bx. In this exam-
ple, the fixed cost is $473, and the variable cost (the cost per box) is $7.39. So
your cost equation is C(x) = 473 + 7.39x. The total cost for 330 boxes is found
by replacing the x in the equation with 330, like this:
C(330) = 473 + 7.39(330)
= 473 + 2,438.70
= 2,911.70
265
Chapter 18: Calculating Profit, Revenue, and Cost

So it will cost the club almost $3,000 to do the mailing and fill 330 boxes.
Using these figures, the club now has more information to help in determin-
ing the price it wants to charge for the boxes so it can make a decent profit.
Using the high-low method
When a company has several years or several other periods of information
on cost, it can decide that somewhere between the highest volume on record
and the lowest volume on record works for an estimate of cost in the future.
In this case, the company can choose to use the high-low method to deter-
mine a formula for the cost. The high-low method pretty much ignores all the
data in between the highest and lowest volumes. The computation is much
easier when you have just two points to consider. The missing numbers in
the cost formula are computed algebraically and are assumed to represent
what goes on with the cost of the product.
Table 18-3 shows the volume and total cost for a company over an eight-year
period.

The high and low values (in volume) from the information given in Table 18-3
were in 2002 and 2005. The volume was 800 in 2002 and 1,400 in 2005.
Resorting to the method of least squares
The method of least squares involves a formula used to find the best linear
equation that’s possible from the information you have at hand. Of course, if
your information is no good, the resulting equation will be worthless. After
all, garbage in, garbage out! But if you have accurate measures of volume and
cost for a few years, you can use the least squares formula to find the best
line for the information.
266
Part V: Successfully Handling the Math Used in the World of Goods and Services

Here’s what the least squares formula does: It gives you the equation of a line
that’s as close to each point in a scatter plot as possible. The line determined
by the formula has the smallest differences in the distances from the points
in the graph measured to a point on the line. Why is the formula named as it
is? Because, built into the formula, the distances are squared so that points
above the line (with a positive difference) and those below the line (with a
negative difference) don’t cancel each other out.
The best-fit linear equation, y = a + bx, for a set of points is found by solving
the following system of equations for a and b:

where n is the number of points or data sets used, Σx is the sum of all the x
coordinates of the points, Σy is the sum of all the y values of the points, Σx2 is
the sum of all the squares of the x values, and Σxy is the sum of the products
of the x and y values.
The easiest way to deal with all the sums, products, and powers needed in
the formula is to make a table. Table 18-4, which uses the information that’s
given in Table 18-3, shows an example of such a table.

Chapter 18: Calculating Profit, Revenue, and Cost

Using the various sums in the least squares equations, you let n = 8, because
you have eight data sets. You can see the sums of the various categories in
Table 18-4. Fill in those various sums wherever they appear in the equations
of the formula, like so:
8a + b(8,900) = 12,100
a(8,900) + b(10,190,000) = 13,650,000
To solve this system of equations for a and b (see Chapter 5 for more on solv-
ing systems of linear equations), you first simplify the second equation by
dividing each term by 100 to get rid of some of those zeros. Then multiply the
terms in the top equation by –89 and the terms in the bottom equation by 8.
This multiplication gives you opposite numbers for the coefficients of a, so
when you add the two equations together, you eliminate the a terms and can
solve for b. When you’re finally ready to solve for b, you get b ≈0.654. Now
substitute that value of b into the first equation and solve for a. Your math
should look like this:

The best model for cost using the data in Table 18-4 is: C(x) = 784.925 + 0.654x.
You get pretty much the same line using the different methods. Of course, the
least squares line is the best measure, because it takes into account all the
points. But this is where judgment comes in. Is all this computation worth the
effort? Only you can decide that. When the scatter plot seems to have a dis-
tinctive flow in one direction, you probably won’t get much difference in the
lines when using the two different methods: high-low and least squares.

Determining Break-Even Volume
Whether you like it or not, businesses are all created to make a profit. After
all, it doesn’t make sense to start up a business with the goal of losing money
or going broke. Figuring out profit with a formula is simple enough. But
coming up with the actual product and sales to make the profit happen is the
biggest challenge.
The break-even volume (which is also sometimes called the break-even point)
is the level of production at which the revenue and the cost are exactly the
same. The profit at the break-even volume is zero. A profit of zero isn’t
exactly what you want, but at the break-even volume (or just beyond it)
everything is all pluses: The difference between revenue and cost is a posi-
tive number.
Finding the break-even volume is relatively simple if you have a profit formula
all worked out and ready to solve. You may have to come up with a cost for-
mula to complete your profit equation (see the earlier section, “What’s It
Gonna Be? Projecting Cost,” for details). After you have your profit equation,
however, the break-even volume is relatively straightforward to solve for.
Without a profit equation, you can resort to using a chart or a graph to esti-
mate your break-even volume.
Solving for break-even 
volume with a formula
You can solve for the break-even volume by setting the cost part of the profit
equation equal to the revenue part of the profit equation and then solving for
the volume, x. Or you can use the profit equation in its usual form, letting the
profit equal 0; again, you solve for the volume, x.
Try solving for the break-even volume with this example: Say that a silk tie
vendor purchases ties from his supplier through the mail. The vendor’s cost
for a shipment of ties includes the postage and handling charge of $47 plus
the cost per tie, which is $13.80. He sells the ties for $29.95 each. What’s his
break-even volume?
The profit function for this vendor’s venture is Profit = Revenue – Cost. After
plugging in his specific numbers, you get this equation: Profit = 29.95x –
(47.00 + 13.80x), where x is the number of ties. All you have to do now is let
the profit equal 0 and then solve for the value of x, like this:

The volume at break even, x ≈2.910, means that selling three ties will do it —
everything else is gravy. Just look at how the volume works in the profit func-
tion for two ties, three ties, and ten ties:
Profit = 29.95x – (47 + 13.80x)
= 16.15x – 47
Profit (2 ties) = 16.15(2) – 47
= 32.30 – 47
= –14.70
Profit (3 ties) = 16.15(3) – 47
= 48.45 – 47
= +1.45
Profit (10 ties) = 16.15(10) – 47
= 48.45 – 47
= +114.50
The profit with two ties is still negative, but three ties puts the vendor over
the 2.910 break-even volume. And ten ties makes the venture look pretty good.
Working out break-even volume 
from historical data
Even when an exact profit equation isn’t available or hasn’t yet been com-
puted, you can make a decent estimate of the break-even volume from histor-
ical data. And even with two data sets you can find the point of intersection
of revenue and cost.

Consider this example in which the AJ Company has information on its cost
and revenue for the years 2004 and 2006. Using this information, it wants to
estimate the volume at which it can expect to break even. In 2004, the com-
pany had a production and sales volume of 1,300 units for which the cost was
$83,000 and the revenue was $104,000. In 2006, the volume was 2,500 units at
a cost of $155,000 and revenue of $200,000. What can the AJ Company expect
the break-even volume to be if this year’s production is similar in the relation-
ship between revenue and cost?
To solve this problem, you need to plot the two costs with their volumes and
draw a line through them. On the same graph, plot the two revenues with
their volumes and draw a line through them. Estimate where the lines cross,
and you’ve found your break-even volume. From Figure 18-2, the break-even
volume appears to be slightly more than 500 units.

Chapter 19
Accounting for Overhead
and Depreciation
In This Chapter
 Dealing with overhead by apportioning fairly
 Examining the many ways to calculate depreciation
O
verhead, in business math, isn’t the compartment above your airplane
seat where you stow your carry-on luggage. Instead, overhead is the
term used to describe a variety of different costs that are associated with
a business but not necessarily with a particular product or product line in
that business. Overhead may include any of the following:
 Order-getting costs, such as advertising, marketing research, and the
salaries of salespersons
 Research and development of new products
 The salaries and supplies of administrative staff, such as managers and
secretaries (these folks aren’t necessarily assigned to one product, so
the cost of employing them is considered overhead)
 Financial costs, such as interest on loans or dividends to owners
Depreciation, which is figured into the cost of doing business, is another type
of nonmanufacturing cost. Computing the depreciation associated with an
item allows you to determine the current value of that item. Depreciation is
computed in many different ways; you choose the method that provides the
best picture for you and gives you the greatest financial benefit.
This chapter provides several depreciation options and shows you the ins
and outs of computing the depreciation and value of an asset. You’ll also find
apportioning scenarios, which show you how to divvy up overhead fairly.

Keeping an Eye on Overhead Costs
Overhead costs often include marketing, advertising, postage, supplies,
salaries, and other miscellaneous expenses that can’t be delegated to a par-
ticular item or production line.
Overhead has to be paid and allocated fairly to the items or services being
provided so that the profit from the different items can be determined and
proper tax responsibilities executed.
Different overhead items are accounted for and apportioned in different
ways. When many different costs are included in overhead, you may find
that it’s a challenge to determine a fair division. Even within an overhead
area, different costs may need to be handled differently. I show you every-
thing you need to know in the following sections.
Working with order-getting costs
Order-getting costs are incurred in an effort to get orders for products or ser-
vices. Order-getting costs may be associated with the revenue that comes
from the particular orders, but not all activities and costs involved in order-
getting necessarily result in sales. And often, multiple items are involved in a
particular attempt at an order — whether they result in a sale or not.
Order-getting costs include the following:
 Advertising
 Commissions that are directly tied to particular items
 Marketing
 Office expenses
 Other sales promotions
 Salaries of salespersons who may sell one or several different products
 Salaries of secretaries
 Travel and entertainment expenses
Order-getting costs involve both the costs that are directly related to getting
the orders and those that are intermingled with other departments or parts
of the business. The cost of secretarial help, for instance, is apportioned
fairly among the parts of the business that need the help of a secretary, and
each part shares in the expense of having secretaries. The percentage share
is determined for each shared cost category, and the total cost of all the cate-
gories is charged to order-getting.

To understand what I mean, consider some marketing and sales expenses
incurred during the first two months of a year. Table 19-1 shows the expense
and the amount per month. You’ll notice that the salespersons’ commissions
for February are missing. The following example will show you how to calcu-
late them.

If the sales supervisor gets a flat monthly salary plus 12% of the salespersons’
commissions, what’s that monthly salary, and what were the commissions in
February? Also, are the travel and meal expenses proportionate with sales?
To answer all these questions, first determine the flat monthly salary of the
sales supervisor. To do so, calculate what 12% of the commissions were in
January by multiplying the commissions by 12% (in decimal form): $6,000 ×
0.12 = $720. Now subtract the commission amount from the payment to the
sales supervisor: $4,320 – $720 = $3,600.
If the sales supervisor gets $3,600 per month plus a percentage of the com-
missions, determine how much of the February payment to the supervisor is
commission by subtracting the $3,600 from the amount paid in February:
$4,560 – $3,600 = $960.
The $960 is 12% of the commissions, which means that you need to solve this
equation: 12%x = 960, where the variable x represents the commissions. If
you divide both sides by 12% (or 0.12), you get that x = 8,000. So the salesper-
sons’ commissions in February were $8,000.
Finally, you want to determine whether the increased amount spent on travel
and meals in February are consistent with the sales. In other words, did
spending the additional money reap a proportionate amount of revenue? To
find out, simply set up two fractions with the travel and meal expenses in the
numerator (the top of the fraction) and the commissions in the denominator
(the bottom).
275
Chapter 19: Accounting for Overhead and Depreciation

You aren’t shown the actual revenue figures, but if commissions are based
on sales, you’ll be comparing the same things. You just want to look at the
percentages to see whether there’s a big disparity between the expenses and
results in these two months.
For January, you divide $540 by $6,000, and for February you divide $800 by
$8,000. (You didn’t have the commission amount until you did the figuring
earlier.) Here’s what the equations should look like:

The percentages are different, but probably not significantly different. If
you’re in charge of revenue at this company, however, you may want to keep
an eye on the numbers to see if a trend develops.
Give another example a try. Say that a company manufactures three products:
A, B, and C. The company also has three supervisors — one for each product.
One year, a $60,000 advertising expense was allocated to each product in pro-
portion to the net sales of each. The next year, the advertising budget was
increased to $90,000. Of this $90,000, a total of $50,000 was used for general
advertising of the company to increase awareness of its commitment to the
environment. The rest of the advertising budget was divvied up among the
products as follows:
$16,000 for A
$18,000 for B
$6,000 for C
For cost purposes, the advertising expenses were allocated on the basis of
sales. The sales and advertising expenses are shown in Table 19-2. Were the
advertising expenses fairly divided?
Table 19-2

$250,000

$25,000
$28,000
You really have two things going on here: The amount allocated to each prod-
uct to spend on advertising, and the amount being charged to each product
for the cost of advertising. It could be that the best-selling product doesn’t
need as much advertising, but the amounts and percentages should still be
presented and reviewed. Table 19-3 shows the three products, their percent-
age of total net sales, their percentage of budgeted money for advertising,
and their percentage of the total advertising cost charged to them.

Looking at Table 19-3, Product A seems to be in line. Its net sales, share of
the advertising budget, and allocated advertising cost all are fairly close in
number. Products B and C have some disparities, though. Product B, for
instance, has 25% of the net sales and 45% of the advertising budget, and it’s
charged about 28% of the costs. If cost allocation is supposed to be based on
sales, Product B is being charged more than it should be. On the other hand,
Product B also is getting a huge amount of advertising money. Product C
seems to be paying for more than its share of the advertising costs as well.
The supervisors need to sit down and hash this out.
Deciding on allocation options
Overhead comes in a variety of forms, and the costs associated with over-
head are to be allocated to different products, product lines, or services in a
way that fairly divides the costs. Different costs use different means of assign-
ing the proportionate responsibility.
For instance, costs that are related to payroll or personnel can be divided
based on hours of machine usage or total revenue of the product. Similarly,
office supplies can be allocated based on hours or revenue. Financial costs,
such as building loans, insurance, and utilities, can be divided based on
space, revenue, or time.
When calculating overhead, a fair apportionment is determined, and then an
overhead rate or percentage is assigned to the different products or services.
The rate is usually revisited each year to determine whether any significant
changes need to be made.
Consider, for example, a company that produces three different items: A, B,
and C. The items are produced using two machines: Machine X and Machine Y.
The labor force consists of 15 full-time employees. The total space for the
production, storage, and office is 4,000 square feet. Table 19-4 shows the
weekly allocation of machine time, labor, space, and yearly revenue for each
product.

Using the information from Table 19-4, the overhead allocated to the different
products can be computed. But when you calculate, do remember that differ-
ent items produce different percentages and different shares of the categories.
The following example problem will show you how to calculate the overhead
allocations for this company.
The yearly cost of electricity for the business shown in Table 19-4 is $500,000.
Using the total machinery hours, how is the cost divided among the three
products? Is the allocation significantly different if you use hours of labor?
Product A uses a total of 30 hours on the two machines, while Products B and
C use a total of 25 hours and 30 hours, respectively. If you divide the number
of hours that each product uses the machines by 85 (the total hours on both
machines), it turns out that Products A and C use 35.3% each; Product B uses
29.4%. If you multiply the $500,000 electric bill by the percentages, the alloca-
tion assigns $176,500 to Products A and C, and $147,000 to Product B.
If the number of hours of labor is used instead of machinery time, you have
to divide the hours for each product by 600 (the total hours). In doing so,
you find that Product A uses 40%, Product B uses 33.3%, and Product C uses
26.7%. These percentages change the amount of electricity charged to each
product. For instance, now $200,000 is assigned to Product A, $166,500 is
assigned to Product B, and $133,500 is assigned to Product C. As you can see,
Product A now assumes much more of the cost of electricity.
Because the allotments come out rather differently, it’s a judgment call as to
which way to assign the overhead. Another option is to try to use several of the
items with a weighted average as a multiplier. A weighted average is used to
give some items in a list more value or worth than others. Weighted averages
work something like diving or snowboard competitions; you get more points
when the dive or maneuver is more difficult. To find a weighted average, multi-
ply each item by the number assigned as its weight. Then divide the sum of all
the multiplied numbers by the total of all the weights.
278
Part V: Successfully Handling the Math Used in the World of Goods and Services  

In this example, if you value Product A twice as much as you do Product B,
and if you value Product C three times as much as you do Product B, you get
this equation: 2A + 3C + B. The weights are 2, 3 and 1. The sum or total of all
the weights is 6, so you simply divide the multiplications by 6: 
(2A+3C+ 1B) ÷ 6 gives you the weighted average.
Using all of the information in this example, you can now calculate the percent-
ages for each category and product. Table 19-5 shows you the answers. Even
though the storage space doesn’t account for the total area available in the
facility, the percentages reflect the part of the storage space that they occupy.

You may have noticed that the percentages for the weekly hours on Machine X
and the storage space don’t add up to exactly 100%. This discrepancy is due
to rounding. If you’re talking about huge amounts of money and want to avoid
discrepancies, carry the decimals out several more places than just the one
decimal place shown.
Now that you’ve been introduced to weighted averages, try out this example:
Determine the percentage allocation for each product in Table 19-5 if you
assume that
 The hours on the machines are weighted twice that of storage space.
 Labor is weighted three times as much as storage space.
 Revenue is weighted the same as storage space.
To compute each product’s allocation, each percentage is multiplied by its
respective weight factor: 2X, 2Y, 3Labor, 1Space, and 1Revenue. Then the total
is divided by the total of the weightings, or multipliers (2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 9).
Here’s what the calculations would look like for each product:

So, using this weighted arrangement, Product A is assigned 40.8% of the over-
head, Product B has 30.3%, and Product C is assigned 28.9%. Of course, you
can play around with the numbers all you want to make the allocations come
out the way you want them.
Getting the Lowdown on Depreciation
Business assets, such as machinery, buildings, computers, and other equip-
ment, are bound to one day grow old and become outdated. These physical
assets lose value and their worth gradually gets used up. The procedure for
determining the amount to be allocated to entries in valuation of capital
equipment or property statements is referred to as depreciation (a reduction
in value). A common example of this reduction in value involves cars. The
value of a new car drops about 20% (or more!) as soon as you drive it off the
dealer’s lot. In five years, its value can drop around 35%.
A piece of machinery has an initial cost — what you pay at the time of pur-
chase. After the accumulated depreciation (the sum of all the depreciation
over time) is applied, the difference between the initial cost and the accumu-
lated depreciation is the remaining value of the item. This value is often
referred to as salvage value or residual value. Here’s the formula:
Initial cost (purchase price) – Depreciation = Salvage value
When figuring depreciation, you have to determine the asset’s estimated
useful life (how long the asset can be used until it wears out or becomes out-
dated), its salvage value, and the accounting method that you’re going to
apply to compute depreciation over the lifetime of the asset. The methods
most frequently applied to depreciation are
 The straight-line method of depreciation
 The sum-of-the-years’-digits method
 The declining balance method
I explain each of these methods in the following sections.
280
Part V: Successfully Handling the Math Used in the World of Goods and Services  

The sum-of-the-years’-digits and declining balance methods are considered to
be accelerated methods, because they speed up or increase the amount of the
depreciation early in the time period. Why would a company want to speed
up the depreciation? It may need the additional tax break of being able to
deduct more depreciation in the next few years rather than later.
The straight-line method
The straight-line method of depreciation subtracts an equal amount from the
value of the asset each year. When you look at a graph of the value of an asset
for which the straight-line method is used, you see exactly what the method
implies: a straight line. Figure 19-1 shows the value of a storage building
that’s determined with straight-line depreciation.
Figure 19-1 shows the initial value, useful life, and salvage value of the build-
ing. The initial value, in 1995, was $80,000. The salvage value in 2010 is
$20,000. By subtracting the initial year from the last year shown on the chart,
you can find the useful life of the building: 2010 – 1995 = 15 years.
Reading from the table, you see that the value in the year 2000 is $60,000, and
the value in 2006 is about $37,000. Graphs are quick and easy to read, but a
formula that gives you the exact value of the building during a particular year
is better for the accountant (and the IRS).
The equation of a straight line when written in the slope-intercept form is

where b is the y-intercept (the point where the line crosses the vertical axis)
and m is the slope (the steepness or change). Applying the slope-intercept
form to straight-line depreciation, the y-intercept, b, is the initial value of the
asset; the slope, m, is the amount of yearly depreciation; and the input vari-
able, x, is the number of years since purchase. The output variable, y, is the
value of the asset. The following example will show you how to use the slope-
intercept form to solve a straight-line depreciation problem.
Write an equation using straight-line depreciation to find the value of a build-
ing that’s worth $80,000 in 1995 and $20,000 in 2010. Then use that equation
to find the exact value of the building in the year 2006.
To start, use this format:
V(t) = V0 – mt
where V(t) is the value of the asset t years since purchase, V0 is the initial
value, and m is the yearly depreciation of the asset. The initial value is
$80,000, so V0 = 80,000. To find the amount per year of depreciation, divide
the difference between the initial value and the salvage value by the number
of years of useful life, like this:

Replacing the m in the equation with 4,000, the formula to use for the value of
the building in this situation is V(t) = 80,000 – 4,000t, where t is the number of
years since 1995. To find the value of the building in 2006, subtract to find the
useful life: 2006 – 1995 = 11 years. Replace the t with 11 in the formula, and
you get
V(11) = 80,000 – 4,000(11)
= 80,000 – 44,000
= 36,000
So you can see that the building is worth $36,000 in 2006.
You can make a chart or spreadsheet of the exact values of the building for
the different years. Table 19-6 shows you the first five years for the value of
a building whose initial value was $80,000 in 1995 and that depreciated by
$4,000 per year.

The sum-of-the-years’-digits method
Some assets depreciate more rapidly in the first few years of use than they do
later on. Vehicles, for instance, quickly lose a significant percentage of their
value at the beginning of their useful life, and then their values stay steadier
or decline slowly toward the end. One method used to accommodate this
accelerated loss of value is the sum-of-the-years’-digits method.
A big difference between the sum-of-the-years’-digits method and other meth-
ods is that the computations with the sum-of-the-years’-digits method are
made on the depreciation base (the initial value minus the salvage value), not
on the initial cost of the item. Using the sum-of-the-years’-digits method, you
create a series of fractions that add up to 1. The larger fractions come first in
the list and then the fractions get progressively smaller from there. Each
year’s depreciation amount is determined by multiplying the depreciation
base by the designated fraction.
The graph of the values of an item being depreciated by the sum-of-the-
years’-digits method curves down sharply. Figure 19-2 shows an example
graph of values that were computed using the sum-of-the-years’-digits
method.
With the sum-of-the-years’-digits method, you take the number of years of esti-
mated life of the asset and add that number to each positive whole number
smaller than it. The sum of the numbers is the denominator (bottom) of the
fractions to be used. The numerators (tops) of the fractions are the numbers
that were added together. After subtracting the salvage value from the original
value of the asset, you multiply the difference (the depreciation base) by the
decreasing fractions to get the amount to be depreciated each year.
283
Chapter 19: Accounting for Overhead and Depreciation

So if the useful life of an asset is 5 years, you add 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 to get 15 for
the denominators. Then you create the fractions that are used in figuring the
yearly depreciation:

Ready for an example? Suppose a piece of equipment costs $90,000 and has a
useful life of 10 years. The salvage value of the equipment is $13,000. Using
the sum-of-the-years’-digits method, determine the amount of depreciation
and the value of the equipment for each year of its useful life. (Tip: A spread-
sheet is useful for these computations. Refer to Chapter 5 for more on using
spreadsheets in your calculations.)

Note that the final value comes out to be the salvage value. The sum-of-the-
years’-digits methods subtracts parts of the depreciation base from the initial
value until the final value is the salvage value.
The declining balance method
Some assets lose a major portion of their value early in their estimated lives.
Like the sum-of-the-years’-digits method (see the previous section), the
declining balance method is another way to accelerate depreciation. However,
285
Chapter 19: Accounting for Overhead and Depreciation

the declining balance method is different from the sum-of-the-years’-digits
method in two respects:
 The rate of depreciation is a uniform rate. (The rate doesn’t change each
year; it stays the same.)
 The computations are made on the initial value of the asset, not on the
depreciation base.
By law, the rate can’t exceed twice the rate of a straight-line method. And
even though the computations are made on the initial cost of the asset, the
final value can’t be reduced to below salvage.
The declining balance method is accomplished using many possible multipli-
ers. The annual depreciation can be multiplied by any number between 1 and
2, including the 2. You can multiply by 1.1, 1.2, 1.5, 1.75, 1.95, or anything, as
long as it’s not more than 2 (and less than 1). In the next sections, you see the
different multipliers at work.
Doubling your pleasure with the double declining balance method
In practice, the full extent of acceleration — twice — is most commonly used,
because it creates the most rapid acceleration possible. When twice the
straight-line method is employed, it’s called the double declining balance
method.
To compute depreciation using the double declining balance method, you
follow these steps:
1. Determine the annual percentage depreciation that you would use
with the straight-line method.
2. Double the percentage from Step 1.
3. Multiply the asset’s current value by the percentage to get the depre-
ciation for that year.
4. To get the current value of the asset, subtract the depreciation from
the current value.
Try using the double declining balance method with this example: Imagine
that a new truck costs $60,000 and has a useful life of 5 years. The salvage
value of the truck at the end of 5 years is $8,000. Using the double declining
balance method, determine the depreciation and value of the truck for its
5 years of useful life.
286
Part V: Successfully Handling the Math Used in the World of Goods and Services  

If you were to use the straight-line method over a 5-year period, you would
depreciate 1⁄5 or 20% per year:
,
,
.
%
60 000
12 000
5
1
0 20

=
=
=
So, doubling that 20% depreciation rate, you get 40% depreciation per year.
The 40% first multiplies the initial value of the truck. Then, in future computa-
tions, the 40% multiplies the value of the truck from the previous year. The
depreciation amount is subtracted from the previous year’s value to get the
new value. Table 19-8 shows you how the numbers work out in this method.

40% × $60,000 = $24,000
$60,000 – $24,000 = $36,000
2
40% × $36,000 = $14,400
$36,000 – $14,400 = $21,600
3
40% × $21,600 = $8,640
$21,600 – $8,640 = $12,960
4
40% × $12,960 = $5,184
$12,960 – $5,184 = $7,776
5
0
The value $7,776 (in the fourth year) is lower than the $8,000 salvage value.
So only $4,960 is depreciated in the fourth year, and the value is recorded as
$8,000 for the fourth year. You don’t have any depreciation in the fifth year.
Declining at a different rate
Multiplying a straight-line depreciation percentage or value by 2 is the maxi-
mum that’s allowed, but what if you want to multiply by a number that accel-
erates the depreciation rate — but not quite as much as doubling it? For
example, say that you want to use 11⁄2 times or 13⁄4 times the rate. Well, guess
what? You can do it! In fact, in Table 19-9, I show you what the depreciation
schedule looks like if you use 11⁄2 times the straight-line amount. The percent-
age amount you use for 11⁄2 times is: 20% × 11⁄2 = 30%.
So you’ll be multiplying the value of the truck from the previous year by 30%
to get the amount that’s depreciated. Then you subtract the depreciation
amount from the value of the truck that year to get the new value of the
287
Chapter 19: Accounting for Overhead and Depreciation

truck. In general, no matter what multiplier you use, the procedure to find the
new, depreciated value is
% depreciation rate × Previous year’s value = Amount of depreciation
Previous year’s value – Amount of depreciation = New value

30% × $42,000 = $12,600
$42,000 – $12,600 = $29,400
3
30% × $29,400 = $8,820
$29,400 – $8,820 = $20,580
4
30% × $20,580 = $6,174
$20,580 – $6,174 = $14,406
5
30% × $14,406 = $4,321.80
$14,406 – $4,321.80 = $10,084.20
As you see in Table 19-9, the item isn’t fully depreciated. The salvage value is
$8,000, and this method doesn’t reduce the value to salvage in the 5-year
useful life span. The depreciation amount is accelerated at the beginning, but
it tapers off toward the end. Can you accelerate the depreciation so that the
value is fully depreciated at the end of its useful life? Yes you can! The follow-
ing section tells you how.
Determining a declining balance rate to fully depreciate
When using the declining balance method, you determine the remaining
value of an asset for a particular year by subtracting the depreciation amount
from the previous year’s balance. So if the depreciation rate is 30%, you use
this formula: V – 30%V = (1 – 30%)V = (100% – 30%)V = 70%V. So you’re left
with 70%V. Every year, the value of the asset is 70% of what it was the previ-
ous year. The value changes each year, and the amount that’s depreciated
changes, but the percentages stay the same.
Here’s the general formula for finding the salvage value for any percentage
rate:
Vn = (1– r)n Vo
where Vn is the salvage value after n years of useful life, r is the percentage
rate, and Vo is the original value of the asset. You want to figure out what rate
allows the asset to be fully depreciated — and therefore have something to
depreciate every year.
288
Part V: Successfully Handling the Math Used in the World of Goods and Services  

To find the rate you want, you have to divide the salvage value by the original
value, take a root that’s the same as the number of years of usable life, and
then subtract the number you get from 1. You need a scientific calculator to
do this computation.
To find a root on your calculator, change the value on the radical to its 
reciprocal and raise the number under the radical to that fractional power.
For example, to find 
.0 1333333
5
, enter 0.1333333^(1/5) into your scientific
calculator.

Try your hand at an example: Use the formula to find a declining rate that
fully depreciates a $60,000 truck that has a useful life of 5 years and a salvage
value of $8,000.

The rate that works to fully depreciate the truck in five years is about 33.2%.
That rate is slightly higher than the 30% used at 11⁄2 times the straight-line
rate; it’s just enough more to do the full depreciation job.
Ready for another practice example? Use the formula for fully depreciating an
asset that costs $80,000 and has a useful life of 20 years. The salvage value is
$10,000.

Chapter 19: Accounting for Overhead and Depreciation

The rate is about 9.9%, which isn’t quite double the straight-line rate. A 20-year
useful life means that 1⁄20 corresponds to a 5% depreciation rate. The double-
declining method would use twice 5%, which obviously would be 10%.
It’s interesting how just a few decimal places can change the end value over a
20-year period. If the 10% rate is used, the value of the asset in the 20th year
is $9,726 — lower than the salvage value. If you use 9.9%, the value in the
20th year comes out to be $9,945. It’s still lower than the salvage value.
When including more decimal values, for instance 0.0987, or 9.87%, you get a
value of $10,011, which is slightly higher than the salvage value. But if you
include more decimal places and use 0.0987495 or 9.87495%, you get a value
of $10,000 in the 20th year. (These numbers are easy to produce using a com-
puter spreadsheet. See Chapter 5 for details.)

Advertising on the Super Bowl
One important element in overhead expenses is
advertising. While most companies try to spread
their advertising and advertising expenses over
the entire year, some put all their eggs in one
basket: the Super Bowl basket. These folks
hope that a flashy and memorable Super Bowl
commercial will result in more customers and
more revenue. With commercial spots com-
manding nearly 3 million dollars for 30 seconds
(that’s $100,000 per second), it’s a real gamble
that the Super Bowl commercial will be memo-
rable enough and seen by enough people to
have an impact. Advertisers are usually con-
cerned that viewers who record programs are
fast-forwarding through commercials during
regular broadcasts, but this isn’t the case with
the Super Bowl. In this case, the commercials
are sometimes more entertaining than the
actual game. But that’s still a lot of money to
spend on advertising.

Keeping Track of Inventory
In This Chapter
 Examining inventory and turnover
 Rotating inventory with FIFO and LIFO
 Computing the Economic Order Quantity
A
business has an inventory if it accumulates things such as raw materi-
als used to produce products, supplies needed to run the business,
partly finished goods, or finished goods. The object of the business is to sell
the finished goods at a profit, so you’d think that the quicker the items move
out the better. Sometimes, though, it pays to hold onto finished goods. Why?
Well, it increases the size of the inventory and you can wait for the prices to
increase. The hold versus sell proposition is a real balancing act for busi-
nesses, and sometimes it requires a lot of luck along with good business
sense to make it all work.
Inventory can be accounted for using cost inventory or retail inventory. Both
options are discussed and illustrated in this chapter so you can make a judg-
ment as to which works best in your situation. The FIFO (first-in-first-out) and
LIFO (last-in-first-out) methods, which are also discussed in this chapter,
have implications involving when to take profits and how to reduce taxes.
Controlling Inventory and Turnover
For small businesses, controlling inventory isn’t terribly difficult — especially
if the owner can simply walk into the storage area and count the number of
boxes of supplies or the number of each item that has been produced. The
larger the business, however, the bigger the challenge of keeping track of the
items available in storage. Even more difficult is tracking what has already
been loaded onto the trucks.
As a business grows, it becomes more and more important to keep track of
inventory and how quickly the items being stored are sold. A measure of how
quickly things move from inventory to sale and then are replenished is referred
to as the inventory turnover rate.

In the following sections, I explain the differences between cost inventory
and retail inventory, and I show you how to calculate each. I also introduce
you to inventory turnover.
Comparing cost inventory 
and retail inventory
Inventory is counted differently in different situations. The number of items
is changed into monetary value by multiplying how many by how much in
terms of money. Factor into that the choice between cost inventory and retail
inventory and you find that you have options galore. As you can imagine,
many decisions need to be made. In general, though, after you choose a par-
ticular inventory method, you stick with it and don’t flip-flop around. You
stick to one method so you don’t run afoul of the tax people.
Here’s the lowdown on the two primary inventory methods:
 Cost inventory: A cost inventory is used primarily by smaller retailers.
The cost inventory gives an evaluation of the merchandise before any
markup (in other words, before the goods are sold).
 Retail inventory: A retail inventory is used by larger stores to keep track
of their merchandise. They find that sales, customer returns, discounts
by employees, and shortages are easier to keep track of when the cost
plus markup is assigned first. The cost inventory doesn’t keep track of
losses due to damage or mishandling as easily as retail inventory, so for
large businesses, the retail inventory is generally preferred.
Cost inventory: Keeping track of inventory 
with the cost of merchandise
The basis behind keeping track of a business’s assets is to count up what’s
available at inventory. The company bookkeeper may keep several different
types or categories of inventory, including raw products, partially finished
goods, finished goods, office supplies, and so on. Whether the inventory is all
lumped together or figured separately, the main process is the same: Count
the beginning, factor in the additions and subtractions, and the net result is
the end inventory.
Here’s the formula for finding the inventory at the end of a period:
Inventory at period end = Beginning inventory + Purchases – Goods sold
Having a handle on inventory means keeping good track of purchases, sales,
and adjustments due to loss or damage. The following example should help
you understand how to do this by using the inventory formula.
292
Part V: Successfully Handling the Math Used in the World of Goods and Services  

Mother Nature’s Bird Seed Shop had an inventory (at cost), on January 1, of
$45,300. During the next three months, additional purchases of $13,000 and
$675 were made. Also during those months, the cost of goods sold was $22,550.
When the manager did a physical inventory at the end of the three months
(actually counted every bag and box of every product), he determined that the
inventory should be $36,825. Do the computed inventory and physical inven-
tory agree?
To find out, first you need to determine the computed inventory by adding
the purchases to the beginning inventory and then subtracting the sales:
$45,300 + $13,000 + $675 – $22,550 = $36,425.
The physical inventory is $36,825, so you can see that the difference is $400.
That is, the physical inventory is $400 more than what the computed inven-
tory said it should be. One of many scenarios could be the culprit:
 The manager miscounted what’s currently available.
 The inventory figures for the beginning of the year were wrong.
 Something happened during sales or delivery.
The manager, in this situation, will probably keep an eye on the figures in the
future to see if the discrepancy resolves itself. Or he may just count the
boxes again. How would you like to have that job?
Retail inventory: Carrying inventory at retail
Large companies usually carry their inventories at retail rather than at cost
(see the previous section to find out more about at cost inventory). When the
companies need to report on their net worth, they do the necessary computa-
tions to reduce the inventories to cost using the percentage associated with
each product’s markup. With the inventory kept at retail, all purchases have
the retail value calculated before inserting the numbers into the formula.
Computing prices using markup percentages and determining cost from prices
is covered in Chapter 17. The formulas you need are also given here.
To compute the retail price when given the cost of an item and the markup
percentage, or to compute the original cost of an item when given its retail
price and the markup, use these formulas:
Retail price
100%
% markup
Cost of item
=
-
Cost of item = Retail price (100% – % markup)
Try out these formulas with the following example: The Man’s Man Merchandise
Mart had a suit inventory at retail of $19,500 at the beginning of the month.
During the next two months, an additional $24,000 worth of suits was purchased
at cost. Also during that two-month period, the store had sales of $37,900. If the
standard markup on all items is 40%, what’s the inventory at retail at the end of
the two months?
293
Chapter 20: Keeping Track of Inventory

To compute the value at retail of the newly purchased merchandise, use the
formula to change $24,000 to its retail value with a 40% markup. Here’s what
your math should look like:

=
Now use the $40,000 in purchases to compute the current inventory:
Inventory = $19,500 + $40,000 – $37,900
= $21,600
If the Man’s Man Merchandise Mart needs to determine the value of the
inventory at cost (so they can do a net worth report), you would work the
formula like this:
Cost of item = 21,600 (100% – 40%)
= 21,600(60%)
= 21,600(0.60)
= 12,960
So, the merchandise at inventory has a cost of $12,960.
Keeping track of inventory at retail makes the computation easier when figur-
ing in discounts, customer returns, and other variations. I show you how in
the following example.
A local dairy store has a quick turnover due to the nature of the products it
carries: Milk, eggs, and butter have a pretty short shelf life. The store’s inven-
tory at the beginning of the week (at retail) was $6,000. During the week, the
net sales were $23,500. This total included $2,700 in sales to employees, who
get a 10% discount. Purchases (at cost) were $18,000 during that week, and
the markup was 20%. What was the ending inventory (at retail)?
The employees paid $2,700 for their merchandise, which was the price of the
goods with a 10% discount; so employees pay 90% of the full cost. To get the
price of the merchandise before the discount, divide $2,700 by 90% to get
$3,000. The difference between the amount paid and the price of the mer-
chandise is $300 — which must be subtracted from the inventory at retail.
To get the price of the goods purchased using the 20% markup, you subtract
100% – 20% to get the original value of 80% of what’s being charged. Divide
294
Part V: Successfully Handling the Math Used in the World of Goods and Services  

$18,000 by 80% to get $22,500. So the inventory at the end of the week is fig-
ured with this formula:
Inventory = Beginning amount – Net sales – Adjustment due to the
employee discount + Purchased items (at retail)
Now you just have to plug in the correct numbers to get the answer:
Inventory = $6,000 – $23,500 – $300 + $22,500
= $4,700
Estimating turnover with 
an inventory ratio
An inventory turnover ratio provides a business with an estimate of how
quickly the current inventory is being sold and replaced by new inventory
during a particular time period. In general, the higher the number obtained
by the inventory turnover ratio, the more often the inventory is sold and
replaced.
Inventory turnover is an important measure of management efficiency. For
instance, if a business has too much inventory, it’s probably tying up money
that could be better used elsewhere. On the other hand, if the company 
doesn’t have enough inventory, it may lose business if a customer wants
immediate delivery when enough of the product isn’t available to fill the order.
Note: An inventory that consists of fresh food will have a higher turnover
than an inventory of equipment or goods that doesn’t spoil. Also, a company
may do a separate inventory turnover ratio for each different product — or it
may decide to lump all the products together.
To calculate the inventory turnover ratio, use one of the following formulas:
Inventory Turnover Ratio

Average Inventory

To get an average inventory, use this formula:

ratio in grocery stores or any business that deals with perishable or strictly
seasonal products.

of $10,000, and an ending inventory of $8,000. What’s the inventory turnover

So the turnover ratio is about 8.33. Whether this is a good turnover ratio
depends on the business. What’s going to be interesting to the small busi-
nessperson is how the turnover ratio changes and what seems to be influenc-
ing that change.
Examples with a twist: Determining average inventory
One way to compute average inventory is to divide the beginning and ending
amounts by 2. Another way to determine average inventory is to record the
296
Part V: Successfully Handling the Math Used in the World of Goods and Services  

inventory periodically and use each of the figures in the average. Check out
the following example to see what I mean.
A company that keeps its inventory at cost recorded the following inventory
amounts:
January 1: $220,000
April 1: $240,000
July 1: $270,000
October 1: $330,000
December 31: $210,000
If this company had total retail sales of $2,100,000 and it uses a markup of
30%, what’s this company’s inventory turnover rate?
To find out, first calculate the average inventory by adding the five inventory
amounts together and dividing by 5, like this:

Now change the sales to their equivalent at cost using the number in the for-
mula for the inventory turnover:
Cost = Retail price (100% – % markup)
= 2,100,000 (100% – 30%)
= 2,100,000 (70%)
= 2,100,000 (0.70)
= 1,470,000
Now, using the inventory turnover ratio, divide $1,470,000 by $254,000 to get
the turnover rate:

The inventory turnover is about 5.79. But what if the CFO decided that the

Inventory destroyed by the Great Chicago Fire
Montgomery Ward overcame many obstacles to
make his mail-order business a success — not
the least of which was having the first inventory
of his fledgling business go up in flames in the
Great Chicago Fire. Aaron Montgomery Ward
started out as a traveling salesman, dealing in
dry goods in the late 1800s. Ward was concerned
about the plight of Americans living in the
Midwest who were at the mercy of unscrupu-
lous local retailers who took advantage of the
remoteness of the areas and charged exorbitant
prices for often poor-quality goods.
Montgomery determined that he would buy
goods at low cost for cash and sell them to
people through the mail. It took some time to
convince backers to join his endeavor; he had
no capital himself — just a vision. In 1872, Ward
rented a small room on North Clark Street in
Chicago and published the first mail-order cat-
alog with more than 150 general merchandise
items in it. Orders came by mail, and the pur-
chases were delivered to the railroad station
nearest the customer.
Business wasn’t immediately successful, and
Ward was not at all popular with the local mer-
chants who had had a monopoly until that time.
But the Montgomery Ward catalog came to be
known as the “Wish Book.” It was soon copied
by Sears and others who saw the great promise
of the mail-order trade.

FIFO and LIFO: Giving Order to Inventory
Keeping track of items manufactured or purchased and then sold by a com-
pany can be a daunting task. Thank goodness for today’s bar codes and hand-
held devices that make counting and accounting easier and more efficient.
And, of course, using technology means that you’ll never have a mistake in
your inventory. After all, technology is perfect. Yeah, right!
Okay, so keeping track of inventory still has its challenges in today’s business
environment. You may keep track of inventory with FIFO or maybe with LIFO.
No, these aren’t names for cute little puppy dogs. FIFO is the acronym for
first-in-first-out, and LIFO stands for last-in-first-out. Most folks try to use FIFO
when keeping track of products in their refrigerators and pantries. They use
the older stuff first, before it turns green and nasty.
A company is using the FIFO system of inventory control when it sells to its
customers the merchandise that it purchased first. The FIFO system works
well for the retailer when costs and prices are rising because the computed
profit is greater. The items purchased earlier cost the retailer less, and the
price that customers are paying is higher.
A retailer uses the LIFO system when, perhaps for tax reasons, it doesn’t want
to show as great a profit. By using LIFO when prices are increasing, the differ-
ence between the cost and the price are closer, and the net profit is smaller.
Consider this scenario from a hardware store: If an order for leaf rakes comes
in, the number of rakes and total cost for the rakes is removed from the
inventory. Depending on whether you use FIFO or LIFO, the cost for the same
number of rakes will differ — as will the profit. Table 20-1 shows purchases of
leaf rakes by the hardware store over a six-month period.

Chapter 20: Keeping Track of Inventory

In general, when figuring costs using either FIFO or LIFO, you remove as
many items from the inventory listing as are needed to fill the order — taking
all of the earliest (or latest, depending on the method) and moving through
the inventory until the order is filled. You may have to take just part of one
inventory line, if taking all of the items exceeds the order amount.
Using the information from Table 20-1, give the following example a shot.
Suppose an order for 150 leaf rakes comes in, and the FIFO method is
employed to determine the cost of those rakes. What is that cost?
Beginning with the first month, use the 40 rakes purchased in January, the 24
rakes purchased in February, the 60 rakes purchased in March, and 26 of the
rakes purchased in April. (You only need 26 of the 72 rakes purchased in
April to fill the order of 150 rakes.) Reading the totals for January, February,
and March from the table, you add the total costs: $160 + $102 + $270 = $532.
Now multiply the 26 rakes from April by $4.40 to get $114.40. Add this to the
$532, and the total for all 150 rakes is: $532 + $114.40 = $646.40.
The business manager for the hardware store that received an order for 150
rakes wants to minimize the profit during this boom time, which happened to
occur in the summer. She decides to figure the cost of the rakes using LIFO.
What’s the cost of the 150 rakes (using the figures in Table 20-1)?
Beginning with the last month, use the 48 rakes purchased in June, the 90 rakes
purchased in May, and 12 of the rakes purchased in April to get to the 150 rakes
needed to fill the order. From the table, the total purchases in June and May
are: $220.80 + $405 = $625.80. Now multiply 12 by $4.40 for a cost of $52.80 in
April. Add that to the earlier purchases, and the total is: $625.80 + $52.80 =
$678.60. The cost is $32.20 more than that obtained using the FIFO method.
Determining Economic Order Quantity
The Economic Order Quantity, or EOQ, is the optimum number of items to be
manufactured or ordered each time a business produces products or places
an order for products. The EOQ applies to retailers that need a steady supply
of some item and that want to have enough of the item at hand but don’t want
to pay too much for shipping or storage. The EOQ also applies to manufactur-
ers that don’t want to pay too much for setup costs and storage of the items.
The balancing act here involves two opposing influences: the cost of ordering
or manufacturing versus the cost of storage or carrying inventory. Both sce-
narios (a retailer purchasing and a manufacturer producing) assume some
steady and predictable demand for the item or items being produced.
Figures 20-1 and 20-2 show two different options for manufacturing or order-
ing and the resulting inventory. Both graphs show a total of 2,000 items being

manufactured or ordered. The graph in Figure 20-1 illustrates the number of
items at inventory when there’s only one manufacturing or order; the graph
in Figure 20-2 shows the number of items at inventory when the manufactur-
ing or ordering is done four separate times during the year.
A ceramic company makes decorative mugs with graphics depicting patriotic
scenes. The company can count on orders for about 600 mugs each month
throughout the year (for a total of about 7,200 each year). It costs $500 for
the setup and labor to produce the mugs — no matter how many are pro-
duced at that time. The carrying cost (cost of storage, insurance, and inter-
est) is $2 per mug per year. Which scenario is more economical: producing
600 mugs each month, producing 1,800 mugs every three months, or produc-
ing all 7,200 mugs at the beginning of the year?

Chapter 20: Keeping Track of Inventory

Table 20-2 shows you the three different possibilities for the production
schedule needed to produce 7,200 mugs per year. In each case, the carrying
cost is equal to half the number produced during the time period. Why?
Because half the production size is the average number of mugs in storage at
any one time. And the cost of storage is for the entire year.
The average inventory is half the production size, because you figure that,
right after production, you have all the mugs, and at the end of the time
period, when you have to produce more mugs, you will be down to 0 mugs.
So the average is the total amount plus 0 divided by 2 — the average. (Refer
to Figure 20-2 for an illustration of the average inventory — how it’s half the
production level.)

Referring to Table 20-2, you see that the total cost first went down when the
number of setups was reduced from 12 to 4, but then the total cost increased
when the cost of storage became greater. The big balancing act of storing
versus setups is boiled down to a formula that allows you to determine the
best quantity to produce at one time — and the number of times per year to
do the production.
The Economic Order Quantity, or EOQ, is estimated with the following formula:
Q
CK
SR
2
=
where Q is the quantity you want (the number of items to produce or order
at one time), S is the setup cost or shipping cost per order, R is the required
number of items needed each year, C is the cost per unit being manufactured
or ordered, and K is the inventory carrying charge given as a percentage of
the cost or value of the item. The upcoming example shows you how to use
this formula.

Part V: Successfully Handling the Math Used in the World of Goods and Services  

The ceramic company depicted in Table 20-2 can count on orders for about
600 mugs each month throughout the year. As noted in the earlier problem,
it costs the company $500 for the setup and labor to produce mugs — no
matter how many are produced at that time. The carrying cost is $2 per mug,
which is determined by multiplying the cost per mug, $10, by the inventory
carrying charge, 20%. Use the EOQ formula to determine the number of mugs
that should be produced and how many times each year to make them.
Using the formula, you replace S with $500, R with 7,200, C with $10, and K
with 0.20. You actually already have the value of CK from the stated $2 carry-
ing charge per mug. Now plug the numbers in like so:

As you can see, that’s almost 1,900 mugs per run. The company needs a total
of 7,200 mugs for the year, and 1,900 doesn’t divide 7,200 evenly, so consider
two possibilities:
 Option 1: Produce 1,900 in each month of January, April, and July, and
then 1,500 in October.
 Option 2: Produce graduated amounts of mugs with 1,920 in January,
1,880 in April, 1,840 in July, and the final 1,560 in October.
To compare the two options, refer to Table 20-3 for Option 1 and Table 20-4
for Option 2. The carrying charge changes with the number of mugs at inven-
tory. In Option 1, the average of 1,900 mugs is being stored for three-fourths
of the year; the average of 1,500 mugs is being stored for one-fourth of a year.
In Option 2, the average inventory changes during each quarter year (begin-
ning in January, April, July, and October), and that average number of mugs is
stored for just its respective one-fourth of a year.

It appears that you can play around with the order sizes, but you don’t really
save anything by changing the order sizes. For simplicity, you may want to
consider the simpler route and make the ordering process more consistent.
Try out one more example: Say that a specialty coffee shop orders its paper
cups from a company in a neighboring state. Each order the shop places for
cups has a flat service charge of $40; the actual shipping charges are included
in the cost per cup. The cups cost $0.0325 each, and the coffee shop uses
900,000 cups annually, spread evenly over the entire year. If it costs the shop
a 10% carrying charge (based on the cost of the cups) to store the cups, how
many cups should the coffee shop order at a time? Note: Assume that the
shop has storage room for up to 150,000 cups.
Using the EOQ formula, and letting S be $40, R be 900,000, C be 0.0325, and K
be 10%, gives you:

That’s almost 150,000 cups per order. Dividing 900,000 by 150,000, you get 6,
so the coffee shop should place 6 orders of 150,000 cups each. If the shop
tries to follow the value of the equation exactly, it would need to order
148,842 cups the first 5 times and then 155,790 on the 6th order. However,
because the coffee shop doesn’t have room for more than 150,000 cups, the
150,000 number is the best choice.

O
wning or managing a rental property has its chal-
lenges. For instance, you have to determine a fair
rental amount, and then you actually have to collect that
amount. And just when you think you’re safe, loans, mort-
gages, utilities, and taxes get thrown into the mix when
you determine revenue and cost. Last but not least, you
have to calculate areas and perimeters in order to main-
tain your buildings. After all, you can’t buy new carpet or
have someone clean your building without knowing your
square footage. As you can see, all the different facets of
a rental business have their own special mathematical
needs and processes. But don’t worry! I have included
everything you need to know in this part.

easurements tell you about the size of something. Say, a building lot,
for example. And a Floridian’s yardstick is the same as one belonging
to someone from Montana. In fact, measurements are the same almost every-
where you go. So you can feel confident that your calculation of 6 square feet
(sq. ft.) is the same as the next person’s understanding of the same footage.
Your challenge, instead, is to know how to do the computations of the area of
a room or building so you can do comparisons with someone else.
Businesses both expand and contract. What I mean is that they sometimes
need to add space, reconfigure existing space, rent out part of their space,
or relocate to smaller quarters. And it’s not just the inside areas that need to
be measured. Many businesses have large parking lots that need to be resur-
faced or cleared of snow; they also may have grounds to be mowed and land-
scaped. Many aspects of a business and the space it takes up involve
knowing how to determine the amount of area needed.
Perfect squares are important when it comes to measurements, but so are
irregular shapes. So this chapter shows you how to accommodate those
irregular shapes in business — to think outside the proverbial square box.
I show you how to compute square footage (even when the area being mea-
sured is not square) so you can use it to determine the cost of carpeting or
marble flooring or how much heating capacity you need. Also, in this chapter,
you discover how to measure like a surveyor: in metes and bounds. The
information in this chapter allows you to measure and calculate on your
own or verify what the Realtor, interior designer, or contractor tells you.

Exploring Area and Perimeter Formulas
for Different Figures
Several different area formulas are used throughout this chapter. In the later
section, “Squaring Off with Square Measures,” for instance, you see the for-
mula for the area of a rectangle. In the section “Measuring Irregular Spaces,”
you become familiar with the formulas for the areas of triangles, trapezoids,
and regular polygons (a polygon is a figure whose sides are segments).
This section helps you get started with basic area and perimeter tools. You find
formulas for the commonly used figures found in buildings and plots of land.
Even though every polygon can be broken into a number of triangles (see the
later section “Trying out triangles”) and the area can be computed using those
triangles, this method should be saved for a last resort. Why? It’s generally
easier to use the specific formula designed for that specific type of figure.
In the following sections, I provide sketches of geometric figures, brief
descriptions of those figures, and formulas for area and perimeter of the fig-
ures. The perimeter of a polygon or curved figure is the distance around the
outside. The area of a figure is the number of square units you can fit inside
it. You find some of the figures in this section later in the chapter, accompa-
nying possible scenarios. Other figures and their formulas are offered here
for your quick reference.
Rectangles
A rectangle is a four-sided polygon with square corners (see Figure 21-1). The
opposite sides, denoted by l for length and w for width, are parallel and equal
in length. To find the perimeter of a rectangle, you can add up the four sides,
or you can use this formula:
P = 2(l + w)
As you can see, this formula tells you to add the length to the width and then
double the sum. To find the area of a rectangle, use this formula:
A = lw
Here you just have to multiply the length by the width. Pretty simple!
w
l

A rectangle.

Part VI: Surviving the Math for Business Facilities and Operations 

Squares
A square is a four-sided polygon with square corners (see Figure 21-2). With
this figure, all sides are the same measure, denoted s. The perimeter of a
square is just 4 times the measure of a side:
P = 4s
The area of a square is the measure of a side squared:
A =s2
Parallelograms
A parallelogram is a four-sided figure whose opposite sides, the length and
width, are parallel and of the same measure. Think of it as being a squished
rectangle — the angles are usually not 90°. You can see what a parallelogram
looks like in Figure 21-3.
The perimeter of a parallelogram is found the same way as a rectangle’s
perimeter — just add up the sides. Or, if you’d like, you can use this formula:
P = 2(l + w)
To find the area, you multiply one of the sides by the distance between that
side and the opposite side. You call the perpendicular distance between two
sides of a parallelogram its height, h. So your formula looks like this:
A = lh

Chapter 21: Measuring Properties

Here’s an example to wrap your brain around: Say that a plot of land is
shaped like a parallelogram. Walking around the perimeter of the plot, you
measure 400 feet, 150 feet, 400 feet, and 150 feet. You’ve been told that the
plot measures 40,000 sq. ft. What’s the perimeter of the plot, and what’s the
height (the distance between the two longer sides)?
The perimeter is just the sum of the measures of the sides. You can either
add the sides (400 + 150 + 400 + 150) or you can use the formula:
P = 2(400+150)
= 2(550)
= 1,100 feet
If the area of the plot is 40,000 sq. ft., the distance between the two longer
sides (the sides that measure 400 feet) must be 100 feet. The 100 feet is the
height. Using the area formula, you see that 40,000 = 400 × 100.
Triangles
A triangle, shown in Figure 21-4, is a three-sided polygon. There’s no elegant
way to find the perimeter — you just add up the lengths of the sides. You find
the area of a triangle in one of two ways. You can use either of these formulas:

The first equation is the traditional formula where you multiply one side by
the distance to the opposite corner and take half of that product (I refer to
this as the half-of formula). The second formula is called Heron’s formula; here
you use the lengths of the sides and half the perimeter, s. I discuss both of
these formulas in the section “Trying Out Triangles.”

Trapezoids
A trapezoid is a four-sided polygon with just two sides parallel (see Figure 21-5).
The perimeter is found by adding up the lengths of the four sides:
P = a1 + a2 + b1 + b2
The area is found by multiplying the height, h, which is the distance between
the two parallel sides, by the sum of the lengths of the two parallel sides and
then taking half of the product. Here’s the formula:

Regular polygons
A regular polygon is different from just any old polygon because all the sides
are the same measure and all the angles are the same measure. Refer to
Figure 21-6 to see a regular hexagon. The perimeter of a regular polygon is
found by multiplying the measure of any side by the number of sides:
P = sn
The area of a regular polygon is found by multiplying the distance from a side
to the center, denoted by a (for apothem), by the length of one of the sides, s,
by the number of sides, n, and then taking half of that product. In other
words, the formula looks like this:

Circles
A circle is a curved shape where all the points on the figure are some set dis-
tance from the center (see Figure 21-7). The set distance is called the circle’s
radius, denoted by r. The distance all the way across a circle is called the
diameter. The diameter is twice the radius. To find the perimeter of a circle
(also called its circumference), you multiply 2 by 3.14159 (which is π) by the
length of the radius. Here’s the formula:
P = 2πr
To find the area of a circle, use
A = πr2.
The value of π is approximately 3.14, 3.1416, 3.14159, or . . . . Actually, π (the
Greek letter “pi”) has no exact numerical value. Use as many or as few of the
decimal places as you desire. The more digits you use, though, the more
accurate your computation.
Here’s an example: What are the perimeter and area of a circular garden if the
distance all the way across the garden is 40 feet?
The diameter is twice the radius, so the radius of this circle is 20 feet. The
perimeter of the garden is:
P = 2 × 3.14159 × 20
= 125.6636 feet

You can now use these figures to determine how much border material to
purchase and how much fertilizer is needed.
Ellipses
An ellipse is an oval or egg-shaped figure (refer to Figure 21-8). Many door
insets and mirrors are ellipses. The perimeter and area of an ellipse are found
using two different measures, a and b. These two measures are: the longest
distance inside the ellipse and the shortest distance across the inside. The
two segments representing the distances are always perpendicular to one
another. The perimeter, or distance around the outside of an ellipse, is found

Squaring Off with Square Measurements
When you’re told that an office or warehouse contains 2,400 square feet (sq.
ft.) or that a parking area consists of 5 square miles (sq. mi.), you’re being
given a measurement of the building or area that’s basically just a bunch of
squares all stuck together. A room that has an area of 64 sq. ft. could be a
square room, but it could also be rectangular or triangular. In fact, it may be
a room that looks like an oddly shaped polygon. (A polygon is a geometric
figure with line segments for its sides.)
Figure 21-9 shows you four different possibilities for a floor plan that mea-
sures 64 sq. ft. You could construct many more such rooms and offices in
innumerable other shapes. Maybe you prefer hexagons or octagons or some
other polygon with even more sides than eight. Notice that the triangular
room has squares that are broken apart. Add the irregular pieces together,
and you still get 64 sq. ft.

Part VI: Surviving the Math for Business Facilities and Operations 

Figuring total area in 
various measurements
The total number of square feet in an office or warehouse is typically the sum
of all the areas of useable space in that building. The useable area in a large
office complex may include individual offices, secretarial work areas, mail-
sorting rooms, lunch rooms, and storage spaces. A well-planned business
also may have an outdoor walking track or picnic area.
Indoor rooms need flooring, paint, heating, and air conditioning. Outdoor
areas need to be mowed, weeded, watered, and otherwise tended. All these
activities revolve around determining the respective areas. In the following
sections, I show you how to determine these areas, such as square footage,
square yardage, and square acreage.
Measuring in square feet and square yards
One of the more common measures of area is the square foot, which is often
abbreviated as sq. ft. Floor tiles are often about 1 x 1 foot — making it easy to
estimate the number of square feet in a particular room. Smaller tiles may be
1 x 1 inch. Carpeting is usually measured in square yards (sq. yd). Mixing and
matching the measures makes it necessary to pay attention to details. An
error in measurement can be costly in money, resources, or time. The upcom-
ing example explains how to calculate total square footage and yardage.
Here’s one tidbit that will help you with the example:
1 sq. yd. = 9 sq. ft. (3 ft. × 3 ft.)
Say that you’ve hired a new cleaning crew to take care of your office building.
The total cost of cleaning is determined by how many square feet of carpeting
and tile floor need to be cleaned. Your building has three levels, each with a
total of 1,540 sq. ft. of useable space. The first level of your building contains
four tiled bathrooms, each 3 sq. yd. in area, and a reception area that has a
counter taking up 8 sq. ft. of the carpeted area. The second level has two tiled
bathrooms, each 3 sq. yd. in area, and a tiled lunchroom with an area of 220
sq. ft. The third level has just two tiled bathrooms; one is 3 sq. yd., and the
other (the executive bathroom) is 5 sq. yd. How many square feet of carpeting
and how many square feet of tile are the cleaning crew responsible for?
To solve this problem, you need to first determine how many square feet of
each level are carpeted by subtracting any tiled or covered areas. Add up the
areas of all the carpeted and tiled rooms.
315
Chapter 21: Measuring Properties

On the first level, you have four bathrooms, each 3 sq. yd. To get the square
footage of one bathroom, multiply each side of this equation by 3: 1 sq. yd. = 9
sq. ft. You get: 3 sq. yd. = 27 sq. ft. Four bathrooms means that you multiply the
27 sq. ft. by 4, ending up with 108 sq. ft. of tiled floors in the bathrooms. The
reception area takes up 8 sq. ft. of area, so the first level has 1,540 – 108 – 8 =
1,424 sq. ft. of carpeting.
The second level of the building has two bathrooms measuring 27 sq. ft. (the
same computation as on the first level), which is a total of 27 × 2 = 54 sq. ft.
The second level also has a tiled lunchroom with an area of 220 sq. ft. To get
the amount of tiled floor, add 54 + 220 = 274 sq. ft. Now you’re ready to find
out how much carpeting the second level has: 1,540 – 274 = 1,266 sq. ft.
On the third level, the two bathrooms are tiled. One bathroom has the same
27 sq. ft. as the bathrooms on the first two levels. The second bathroom is
5 sq. yd., so multiply 9 × 5 = 45 sq. ft. To get the total amount of tiled floor on
the third level, add 27 + 45 = 72. Now you can figure out the total amount of
carpeting on that level: 1,540 – 72 = 1,468 sq. ft.
Add the areas of tiled floor for each level: 108 + 274 + 72 = 454 sq. ft. Then add
the areas of carpeting for each level: 1,424 + 1,266 + 1,468 = 4,158 sq. ft. Great
work! Now you’re ready with the figures to negotiate with the cleaning crew.
Determining acres
Large residential yards and parks are measured in acres rather than square
feet, square yards, or square miles. Here are some famous examples of acreage:
 The White House lawn is about 18 acres.
 Hot Springs National Park in Arkansas is 5,760 acres.
 Yellowstone National Park — which is a part of three states — spans
more than 2 million acres.
Here are a few things to keep in mind as you calculate acreage in the follow-
ing example:
1 acre = 43,560 sq. ft.
1 sq. mi. = 640 acres = 27,878,400 sq. ft.
Also remember that the area of a rectangle is found by multiplying the length
of the rectangle by the width of the rectangle.
Suppose you need to determine the size of a new parking lot. You start off by
measuring with feet. Then you do some calculations to change to square feet,
then to square miles, and finally to acres to see which measurement makes
the most sense for your situation. Measuring the length of the rectangle along
316
Part VI: Surviving the Math for Business Facilities and Operations 

a road, you see that it measures 42,300 ft. And the width, measured along a
road perpendicular to the first one, is 5,600 ft.
After you have your measurements in feet, you want to find the area of this
rectangular plot of land in square feet. To do so, you multiply the length by
the width: 42,300 × 5,600 = 236,880,000.
This total is more than 2 hundred million sq. ft. Do you see why measuring in
acres or square miles makes more sense in this scenario?
To get your total into square miles, you have to divide the total number of
square feet by 27,878,400 sq. ft.:
,
,
,
,
.
27 878 400
236 880 000
8 4969
.
That’s almost 8.5 sq. mi.
Now you’re all set to change over to acres. To do so, multiply the square
miles you just figured by 640 (the number of acres in a square mile): 8.4969 ×
640 ≈5,438 acres.
Another way to determine the acreage is to take the total number of square
feet and divide by 43,560 (the number of square feet in an acre), like this:
,
,
,
,
43 560
236 880 000
5 438
.
You get the same answer, of course. But you may find it easier to skip the cal-
culation to change to square miles.
Adjusting for increased area
Most businesses want to be efficient and save money, so they make the most
of the rooms and area that they have in their buildings. But making employees
happy to be at work counts for a lot, too. So, many business owners offer more
pleasant work areas, break rooms, or other facilities to encourage more effi-
ciency and loyalty.
The addition of a solarium, child-care area, or lounge enhances the quality of
a workplace, and increases its value. But additions like these also introduce
some other aspects that need to be dealt with: more area to pay taxes on,
and more air volume to heat and cool.

Chapter 21: Measuring Properties

Computing percents of areas
Adding 300 sq. ft. onto an existing structure currently measuring 3,300 sq. ft.
makes a much bigger impact than adding 300 sq. ft. onto a structure that
measures 6,000 sq. ft. The percent increase gives a better measure and tells
you more about the potential impact on utilities and taxes. The following
example shows you exactly how to compute percents of area.
Say that a 12-x-25 foot solarium is added on the side of a building that origi-
nally had 3,300 square feet. What percentage of the total area will this solar-
ium account for in the building? And by what percent was the area increased
by adding the solarium?
A 12-x-25 foot room measures 300 sq. ft. (to get that answer, you simply multi-
ply 12 × 25). The total area of the building plus the solarium is now: 3,300 +
300 = 3,600 sq. ft.
To find the percentage of the solarium, divide 300 by 3,600, write the answer
as a decimal, and change the decimal to a percent by moving the decimal
place. (Refer to Chapter 2 if you need more information on fractions, deci-
mals, and percents.) Here’s what your math should look like:

As you can see, the solarium is a little more than 8% of the total area of the
building. To determine the percent increase in the area of the building, divide
the increase, 300 sq. ft., by the original square footage, 3,300 sq. ft, like this:

The area of the building increased by a little more than 9%.
Heating up and cooling off
The size of a company’s furnace and air conditioner is determined not
only by the size of the building but also by where in the world it’s located.
A company in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, for instance, won’t need air
conditioning quite as much as a company in southern Florida. However, the
company in Florida doesn’t need to heat things up too much, either.
And what effect does an addition to a building have on the heating and air
conditioning of the total building? If the heating and air conditioning needs
318
Part VI: Surviving the Math for Business Facilities and Operations 

increase at the same rate (percentage) that the size of the building increases,
you can estimate the needs based on the new square footage. The following
example shows you how.
Consider a small clothing store in Madison, Wisconsin, which measures 3,300
sq. ft. before the owners construct a 1,700 sq. ft. addition. If the original store
needed 5.5 tons of cooling capacity and 145,200 Btus of heating capacity,
what are the new requirements for the store plus the addition? Assume that
the requirements for heating and cooling increase at the same rate as the
floor space increases.
To determine the new requirements, create a proportion. (I show you how to
handle ratios and proportions and simple algebraic equations in Chapter 4.)
When solving the cooling problem, first put the old square footage over the
new square footage in a fraction. The new square footage is 3,300 + 1,700 =
5,000 sq. ft. Now set that fraction equal to the old tonnage over the unknown
tonnage, which you designate as x. Find the value of x by cross-multiplying
the numbers in the proportion and solving for x in the equation. Tip: You can
make life easier for yourself by first reducing the fraction on the left to make
the numbers smaller. Your math should look like this:

Chapter 21: Measuring Properties

Taking frontage into consideration
In Figure 21-9, you see four different ways to arrange 64 sq. ft. Those geomet-
ric figures could represent building lots, yards, patios, or ponds. One major
consideration when computing the area of a building lot, park, or parking lot
is the length of the frontage (the part or edge of a piece of land that lies next
to public access) along a road, a lake, or another lot.
Having more lake frontage may be important to a restaurant that wants to
take advantage of patio dining in nice weather and the gorgeous view during
the spring and fall. Other considerations, of course, are that increased lake
frontage means more upkeep. Even though Canada geese are lovely to look
at, they leave behind rather messy and smelly souvenirs along the walkways.
And don’t forget that geese are prone to attacking the unwary stroller who
may venture too close to goslings.
Suppose that a lakeside lot has lake frontage measuring 40 feet. If the rectan-
gular lot has a total area of 8,400 sq. ft., what’s the length of the lot?
The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying the length by the width. If you
assume that the width is 40 feet, you can divide 8,400 by 40 to get 210 feet.
Easy, wasn’t it?
Calculating acreage
Because large parks, grounds, and farms are so big, they’re usually measured
in acres rather than square feet or square yards. Here’s some perspective to
get you started: A football field is about 11⁄3 acres.
The following equivalents can help you solve the following problem (and any
real-life problem you’re up against):
1 acre = 4,840 sq. yd.
1 acre = 43,560 sq. ft.
1 sq. mi. = 640 acres
If you’re ready to work a math problem dealing with acres, check out the fol-
lowing example.
Say that a contractor wants to build a 35,000 sq. ft. office complex on 6 acres
of land. The footprint (the amount of area taken up by the base of the struc-
ture) of that building is 22,000 sq. ft. The industrial park has a rule that a
building’s footprint can’t exceed 10% of the total area of the lot. Is this plan
going to work for the contractor?
320
Part VI: Surviving the Math for Business Facilities and Operations 

You first need to convert your 6 acres to square feet using a proportion. Then
you’re ready to divide 22,000 by this total number of square feet. Change
your decimal answer to a percent. (If you need to review fractions, decimals,
and percents, flip to Chapter 2.) Here’s what your math should look like:

This decimal is equivalent to about 8.4%. The contractor is fine.
Determining Cost per Foot
When building a factory, store, or office, you want to start out with an
approximate cost. This way you know what you’re possibly getting yourself
into before committing yourself to hiring the architect, buying the land, and
so on. Of course, everything seems to cost more than you first figure, but a
ballpark estimate at least helps you determine whether the project is even
worth considering.
Costs per square foot are going to vary widely depending on what part of the
country you live in, the quality of construction materials you intend to use,
the cost of gasoline or diesel fuel, concrete availability, and sometimes other
unpredictable factors. The examples in the following sections serve as gen-
eral guidelines for estimating the costs and having intelligent conversations
with Realtors and builders.
321
Chapter 21: Measuring Properties
Oh, my aching acre
The word acre means, roughly, open field. An
acre was supposed to be the amount of area or
land that you could reasonably expect one man
to plow in one day when his plow was hooked
up to one ox.
An acre isn’t really a square measure like a
square foot or square yard. If you want a square
piece of land that’s exactly an acre, the square
has to be about 208.7 feet on a side or about 69.6
yards on a side. Because of its origin, an acre
isn’t beholden to a square shape. After all, if an
acre of land is long and narrow, it’s easier to
plow — because you don’t have to turn your
plow or tractor around as often.

Renting space
When renting an office or some type of retail or manufacturing space, the
common denominator in determining the total cost of the area is the amount
of floor space dedicated to particular purposes and the cost per unit of that
area. Other factors include location, street accessibility, and parking.
However, those items all help determine what the multiplier or cost per
square unit becomes. The total price is still driven by area. The following
examples give you a clue as to how area affects rent prices. I try to include
different scenarios that may occur so that you can apply what you need from
each to your own situation.
Imagine that an attorney wants to set up shop in a new city and is looking
into renting an office in a particular downtown office building. If offices in
that building go for $30 per square foot, and the lawyer has budgeted no
more than $1,800 per month for rent, how large of an office can she afford?
To find out how much office the attorney can afford, you have to divide
$1,800 by $30, which gives you 60 sq. ft. Guess her decision depends on how
the office is divided and where the windows are.
Here’s another example to consider: A manufacturing company is relocating
to an area where the average cost of renting office space is $111 per sq. ft.
The rental of industrial space is $140 per sq. ft. The company needs 5 offices
that are at least 300 sq. ft. and 2 offices that are at least 500 sq. ft. It also
needs 100,000 sq. ft. of industrial space. What can the company expect to
be paying in monthly rent?
To solve, multiply each square footage requirement by the respective cost
per square foot. Then add the products together. Here’s how:
5 offices
300 sq. ft.
$111
$166,500
2 offices
500 sq. ft.
$111
$111,000
100,000 sq. ft.
$140
$14,000,000
Total $14,277,500

That’s more than $14 million just to rent the space. Might it be a better idea
to build?

Part VI: Surviving the Math for Business Facilities and Operations 

Estimating building costs
A company can choose to rent office and manufacturing space, or it can
decide to buy or build the structure it needs. If the company buys an existing
structure, the cost is pretty clear-cut. Building a new structure, however,
involves selecting a contractor and builder, and it requires some thought and
preplanning. So you want to know the basics in terms of area and cost. This
way you can select a contractor with confidence. After all, you don’t want to
come across any nasty surprises.
Estimating the cost of building a structure is tricky and can be fraught with
pitfalls. So you have to keep a few things in mind. For example, when working
with area, you need to consider the finished square footage (the number that
includes all the livable area, from outside wall to outside wall). This number
doesn’t include garages or unfinished spaces, so the estimate is a bit mislead-
ing. You also need to consider the constructed square footage, which includes
spaces that aren’t lived in. The bottom line in cost is found by doing the actual
figuring using material costs and labor. But a decent estimate is still helpful.
Estimating the cost correctly is important so that
 You don’t overextend yourself.
 You can make budgeting plans for the future.
 You understand any tax implications.
Find out how to determine a building cost estimate with the following examples.
A two-story building for a dentist’s office and laboratory is to be constructed
on a slab with no garage and no basement. What’s the estimated cost if the
building is to measure 2,700 square feet and the estimated cost of construc-
tion is $123 per sq. ft.?
This problem is so easy! You simply multiply 2,700 by $123, which gives you
$332,100 in building costs.
An office building with 2,700 sq. ft. of livable space is to have an unfinished
basement measuring 1,200 sq. ft. The estimated total cost of the business
and basement is $360,000. What’s the cost per square foot?
Even though the building has 1,200 sq. ft. of basement, this isn’t considered
to be useable space, so you divide $360,000 by 2,700 to get $133.33 per sq. ft.

Chapter 21: Measuring Properties

Measuring Irregular Spaces
Wouldn’t it be wonderful (or maybe extremely boring) if everything was rec-
tangular in shape? A rectangle has a set width and length and no special char-
acter. No matter where you choose to walk from one end to the other of a
rectangle, it’ll be the same distance. Having a set measure is efficient, but it
may not be appealing to the restaurant owner who wants nooks and crannies
for intimate dining; to the church council that wants a large, open, octagonal
area; or to the theatre manager who wants a trapezoidal auditorium that
tapers in as it approaches the stage.
The advantage of having just rectangles — and those special rectangles,
called squares — is that the computations for area and perimeter are rela-
tively simple. To determine the area of a rectangle or square, you multiply the
length by the width. To determine the perimeter, you add length and width
together and then double the result. You can find many different area and
perimeter formulas in the earlier section, “Exploring Area and Perimeter
Formulas for Different Figures.”
Breaking spaces into rectangles
Many stores and office buildings have little alcoves or bends that form adja-
cent rooms. By creating interesting shapes for floor plans, you make deter-
mining area and perimeter (so that you can order carpeting or figure out the
cost of cleaning materials) a bit of a challenge.
Most rooms in offices consist of areas with square corners or 90-degree angles.
However, some creatively designed rooms may veer off in some other angles.
A four-sided figure with all 90 degree angles for corners is a rectangle. And the
rectangle is one of the easiest forms to use when figuring area and perimeter.
In Figure 21-10, I show you a large area and several options for breaking up
the area into separate rectangles. When dividing an area into convenient rec-
tangles, you can choose any number of combinations. You usually want to
keep the number of rectangles as small as possible, though. After all, there’s
no need to make this more complicated than necessary.
324
Part VI: Surviving the Math for Business Facilities and Operations 

In Figure 21-11, you can see that I have chosen a particular division and have
put in the dimensions of each individual rectangle. Did I just guess the num-
bers for the broken-up spaces? Of course not! These measurements need
to be precise.
I’m assuming that the room has perfectly perpendicular corners and that the
measures are correct. And you’ll probably notice that the measures are all in
whole feet. This probably isn’t very realistic. Most rooms have measurements
in feet and inches. But the whole feet will do to illustrate my point.

Chapter 21: Measuring Properties

As you can see in Figure 21-11, the upper left-hand rectangle has a measure of
24' x 30'. This division was the simplest, because the width and length are
two entire walls. The upper right-hand rectangle has a measure of 15' x 22'.
The 22-foot measure is pretty obvious. I get the 15-foot measure by subtract-
ing the 9-foot measure that’s along the right side of the first rectangle from
24 feet on the left side of that first rectangle. The middle rectangle that mea-
sures 10' x 43' takes a little more doing to figure out. I get the 10 foot measure
by subtracting 16 feet from 26 feet. I get the 16 feet from the right side of the
bottom rectangle and the 26 feet from the left side, opposite it. Whew! Only
one more to explain: the bottom rectangle. This one is pretty easy. The 16
feet comes from the measure of the right side, and the 13 feet comes from
the measure of the bottom.
Now you can compute the entire area. To do so, simply multiply each width
and height and then add all the separate areas together, like this:

Trying out triangles
If your irregularly shaped room or parking area doesn’t have all right angles
for corners, you get to resort to more creative divisions of the entire area.
Any polygon (a geometric figure with line segments for its sides) can be
divided into a series of triangles.
For example, a four-sided figure divides into two triangles; a five-sided figure
divides into three triangles; a six-sided figure divides into four triangles; and
so on. The general rule is that the number of triangles you need is two less
than the number of sides of the polygon.
Triangles work well when computing the area of an irregular polygon,
because you can determine the area of a triangle using either the standard
half-of formula or with Heron’s formula.
Here’s the half-of formula for finding the area of a triangle:
A
bh
2
1
=
326
Part VI: Surviving the Math for Business Facilities and Operations 

In this formula, b is the measure of the base of the triangle (one of the sides)
and h is the measure of the distance drawn from the vertex (corner) that’s
opposite the base down to the base. The h (height) is always perpendicular
to the base. (If you want see a labeled triangle, check out Figure 21-4 earlier in
this chapter.)
This is Heron’s formula for finding the area of a triangle:
A

In this formula, a, b, and c are the measures of the three sides of the triangle
and s is the semi-perimeter (half the perimeter).
In Figure 21-12, I show you one way to divide up an irregular area using 
triangles.
Now I want to show you how to find the area of this polygon using the two
formulas I just introduced. The area in Figure 21-12 is a quadrilateral (a four-
sided polygon). Only one corner is square (90°), so I divide the area into two
triangles. The top triangle is called a right triangle, because it contains a right,
or 90°, angle.
To find the area of the top triangle (the right triangle) in Figure 21-12, use the
half-of formula that I introduce earlier in this section. The base, b, can be the
side measuring 39 feet, and the height, h, is the side measuring 80 feet. Here’s
what the formula looks like with all the numbers plugged in:
,
A

The half-of formula for the area of a triangle is easier and quicker to use, so it’s
my choice when possible. I could have used Heron’s formula on this triangle,
too, but I don’t use it unless necessary. The bottom triangle in Figure 21-12
isn’t a right triangle. So, to find the area, use Heron’s formula. You first find the
perimeter, P, which is the sum of the measures of the sides of the triangle:
111 ft.
39 ft.
80 ft.
89 ft.
64 ft.
Figure 21-12:
Triangulating

327
Chapter 21: Measuring Properties

P = 89 + 64 + 111
= 264
The semi-perimeter, s, is half that amount, so s = 132. Now use the formula to
solve for the area:

Tracking trapezoids
Some areas in buildings, parking lots, or other such structures are made up
of rectangles with triangles seemingly attached to either end. This shape
resembles a trapezoid. To see what a trapezoidal area looks like, check out
Figure 21-13.
To determine the total area of such a structure, you can use the technique
involving dividing the area into triangles, as I show you in the earlier section
“Trying out triangles,” or you can take advantage of the formula for the area
of a trapezoid to save yourself some time.
The area of a trapezoid that’s h units between the two parallel bases is found
with the following formula:

Describing Property with 
Metes and Bounds
Metes and bounds (not to be confused with leaps and bounds) is a surveyor’s
description of a piece of property. Using metes and bounds when measuring
property dates back to colonial times. The United States inherited the term
from England, which has used metes and bounds for hundreds of years.
Metes and bounds is a way of describing someone’s land or property by way
of a landmark and compass directions. For example, a listing in metes and
bounds may start with something like this: “Beginning at the corner of Main
and University, running N30°E 300 feet to a point, then S63°E 150 feet to a
point . . . .” The surveyor’s description in metes and bounds begins at some
specific point, proceeds around the boundaries of a property with references
to direction and some linear measurement, and always ends up back where
he or she started.
Surveyors’ directions
Before you can deal with both the directions and distances in metes and
bounds, you need to acquaint yourself with surveyors’ measures. It’s impor-
tant for you to note that the directions are given in terms of being east or
west of north or south. For example, a direction that starts out with N for
north has you pointing upward on a piece of paper. Then you lean either left
or right by a particular number of degrees, depending on whether the second
direction is west or east. So the angle N30°E means 30 degrees east of due
north. This would be pointing at about 1:00 on a clock. The angle S60°W
means 60 degrees away from due south or about 8:00 on a clock. Figure 21-14
shows you some compass degree headings to help you with the directions.
329
Chapter 21: Measuring Properties

Measuring a boundary
Consider the following description, which uses metes and bounds to describe
property. Then refer to Figure 21-15 for a diagram of what the description 
represents.
Start at the corner of Sugar Plum Avenue and Maple Drive and proceed N66°E
for 678 feet, where you should see a large boulder. From there, go S54°E for
850 feet where there’s a large tree stump. Now go S44°W for 743 feet to an
abandoned well. From there go N25°W for 560 feet to a wild raspberry
thicket. (Leave the raspberries alone!) Return to the starting point by going
N60°W for 572 feet.
After describing this plot in metes and bounds, you then have a diagram,
which helps you calculate certain measurements. For example, you can figure
the perimeter of this plot by adding up the measures between the points. You
can also figure the area by dividing the area up into three triangles, finding
the area of each triangle, and adding the areas together.

Understanding the Rectangular
Survey System
The rectangular survey system, also called the government survey system, has
been used in North America since the 1700s. The rectangular survey system
establishes units of land that are approximately square — 24 miles on a side.
The measure is considered approximate because the system is based on
meridians that run north and south, converging at the poles. The meridians
are closer together as you get closer to the poles. In a square plot that’s 24
miles on a side, you aren’t going to see all that much convergence or narrow-
ing. However, there is some, and the error has to be accounted for. Any dis-
crepancies in measurement, due to the convergence of the meridians and any
other built-in errors, are usually absorbed into sections along the north and
west boundary of the square. The 24-mile square is divided into 16 more
squares, each measuring 6 miles on a side. The 16 squares are then subdi-
vided into 1-mile square sections.

Chapter 21: Measuring Properties

Basing measures on meridians
The rectangular survey system is implemented for a particular area by estab-
lishing some starting point determined by astronomical measures of latitude
and longitude. For instance, using the starting point, a principal meridian is
determined (running north and south), and then a base line (running east and
west) is set. Running parallel to the principal meridian are guide meridians,
each of which are 24 miles east and west of the principal meridian or another
guide meridian. And then there are standard parallels that run parallel to the
base line. These are also 24 miles apart.
Figure 21-16 shows you a principal meridian, base line, and some guide
meridians and standard parallels. The darkened section is then shown in
more detail in Figure 21-17.
Subdividing the 24-mile square
Each 24-mile square is subdivided. Then it’s identified by ranges, which are 
6-mile-wide strips running vertically (north and south), and by townships,
which are 6-mile-wide strips running horizontally (east and west).

The squares that are 24 miles on a side are divided into 16 squares that are
6 miles on a side. Each of these squares is subdivided into 36 parts, each of
which is a 1-mile square called a section. Each section contains 640 acres.
Figure 21-17 shows you how a section may be broken up into various plots
containing different numbers of acres.
Using the rectangular survey system, a particular plot of land can be
described by its principal meridian and guide meridian, then by ranges and
townships, then by sections, and finally by the portion of the section in
which it lies.

A
mortgage on a building or property is a promise to pay for that building
or property over a period of time. In other words, it’s a way of making a
purchase without having to pay for the whole thing immediately. What makes
a mortgage different from other types of loans or debts is that the building
or property acts as the security; an actual physical entity is involved. The
mortgage is both the process used to produce the loan and the loan itself —
the meaning is dual.
Many different variables figure into the amount and term of a mortgage, and
the amount of it is usually some percentage of the value of the property. A
down payment on the property reduces the amount of money that has to be
loaned. The time agreed on for repayment is usually between 20 or 30 years —
but even that can change, depending on the circumstances and the financial
situation of the person borrowing the money.
Some mortgage-holders like to pay ahead — to finish up early and save
money on interest. Others need a contract for deed. The implications of
paying ahead or changing the method of payment aren’t always clear. Don’t
worry, though. This chapter shows you how to better understand the mathe-
matics of the lending process related to mortgages and other property loans.
For instance, in this chapter I solve the mysteries involved in closing on a
mortgage and computing mortgage payments and total interest. You see how
to accurately make use of appropriate formulas or tables (you get to choose
your favorite method). I also discuss other types of property loans.

Closing In on Closing Costs
When finally securing a mortgage on a property, the prospective buyer
comes to a settlement meeting or closing. At this settlement meeting, the bor-
rower has to deal with any closing costs or other terms.
A closing in money-speak is when all the papers are finally signed, the
promises are officially and formally made, and the buyers get to move their
stuff into their building or build on their newly acquired property.
Closing costs vary from mortgage to mortgage, from lender to lender, and
from situation to situation. Even more confusing is the fact that different clos-
ing costs are called different things by different institutions. Some lenders
even resort to padding their closing fees because they’ve had to reduce their
rates to be competitive. Top it all off with the fact that errors in computations
can occur, and whew! With all these possibilities coming at you, you need to
be prepared to sort through all the information and computations to be sure
that what you see is what you want.
The following are some common closing costs:
 Points (percent of loan amount)
 Appraisal fee
 Title search
 Survey fee (dependent on property size)
 Recording and transfer fees
 Stamp tax (based on amount borrowed)
 Attorney fees
 Prorated interest
 Prepaid property taxes
I use this example throughout the section to explain some of the most
common closing costs and how to compute them: Suppose you’re purchasing
a $300,000 office building. You made a contract deposit of $10,000 at the time
of the offer. (By the way, a contract deposit is an amount of money that holds
or saves the property for you. It’s your guarantee that you’ll buy the place,
and the seller’s promise not to sell the property to someone else.) The total
down payment is 15% of the sale price. Assume that you’re planning to take
out a 30-year, 5.5% fixed rate loan.
336
Part VI: Surviving the Math for Business Facilities and Operations 

Dealing with down payments
A down payment is a certain percentage of the amount being paid for a build-
ing. The greater the down payment, the less to be paid back later — which in
turn reduces the amount that needs to be paid in interest over the years.
In the example involving the $300,000 building (check out the beginning of
this section for the details), the down payment is $300,000 × 0.15 = $45,000.
Because you made a contract deposit of $10,000 so that the seller would
commit to selling to you, you have to subtract $45,000 – 10,000 = $35,000,
which tells you the amount of the additional down payment that’s due at the
time of the closing. The down payment includes your initial deposit plus what-
ever is needed to complete the down payment. This way, you don’t have to
come up with the entire down payment until the time of the closing. The loan
amount is then the difference between the sale price and the entire down pay-
ment: $300,000 – 45,000 = $255,000.
Paying down using points
In the mortgage world, points represent additional money that’s paid to the
lender at the time of the closing. The more points you pay, the more you can
lower the interest rate. The amounts of the points are percentages of the
amount of the loan. For example, 2.5 points translates into 2.5% of the loan
amount. And each point you pay on a 30-year loan reduces your interest rate
by about one-eighth of a percentage point.
Consider the example I introduce at the beginning of the section. The $300,000
building with a down payment of $45,000 has a loan amount of $255,000. You’re
paying 2.5 in points at closing. So to compute the additional amount that you’ll
be paying, multiply the loan amount by the decimal form of the points percent-
age: $255,000 × 0.025 = $6,375.
You planned to pay, before points, 5.5% interest. However, each point you pay
reduces the interest rate by about one-eighth of a percentage point. One-
eighth point is 0.125, or 0.125%. Multiplying that by 2.5, you see that the
reduction in the interest rate is 0.3125%:
.

This lowers the interest rate on the loan to 5.5 – 0.3125 = 5.1875%. This may
not seem like much, but on a 30-year loan, that amounts to significant sav-
ings. (Refer to the later section, “Showing the effect of lowering the interest
rate,” for more information.)
337
Chapter 22: Taking Out Mortgages and Property-Related Loans

Considering appraisal fees
An independent appraiser (someone not connected to the lender or the bor-
rower) determines the market value of a building or piece of property. That
appraiser charges an appraisal fee for her work. The fee usually depends on
the price of the building. For instance, assume that the appraiser in the exam-
ple (at the beginning of the section) charges a flat fee of $200 plus $25 for
each $10,000 the home costs in excess of $200,000. So for the building that
costs $300,000, the $25 extra is charged on $100,000 — which is 10 multiples
of $10,000. So the charge is $200 + 10($25) = $200 + 250 = $450.
Prorating property tax
Property taxes are generally collected by the local governing body once or
twice each year. The seller of property owes taxes for the number of days or
months he owned the property during a particular tax period, and the buyer
owes taxes on the remainder of the tax period. To split up the tax liability
fairly, you have to deal with some prorating. For instance, if a property tax
payment is due on September 30 and the closing is earlier in the year on April
10, the buyer is responsible for the property taxes from April 10 through
September 30, and the seller is responsible for the previous months.
Consider again the $300,000 office building. The tax rate on this building is
6.75% of the assessed value. And the assessed value is 1⁄3 of the value of the
building. To determine the property tax on the building, multiply $300,000 × 1⁄3 ×
0.0675 = $6,750. If the closing is on April 10, and the property taxes are due on
September 30, how much is the buyer responsible for paying?
Five and two-thirds months separate April 10 and September 30. So first you
need to figure out what fraction of a year 52⁄3 months is. To do so, divide by
12, and then multiply that fraction by the annual property taxes, like so:

As you can see, the buyer owes $3,187.50 of the taxes and the seller owes the
difference, $6750 – $3187.50 = $3,562.50.
Often, the closing occurs before the tax bills are available. A common prac-
tice to handle this situation is to estimate the total amount of the tax by figur-
ing 110% of the previous year’s tax bill. Check out the following example to
see how to compute taxes this way.
338
Part VI: Surviving the Math for Business Facilities and Operations 

What’s the estimate of the coming year’s property tax if last year’s was $6,750
and you’re using 110% as a best guess?
To find out, you multiply $6,750 by 1.10 to get $7,425. 
Amortizing Loans with
Three Different Methods
An amortized loan is one in which regular, set payments are made and the inter-
est on the loan is figured on what’s left to be repaid. Even though the principal
(the amount still owed) is decreasing, the payment stays the same, because
that payment is more of an averaging-out of all the payments — from when the
principal is at the highest until the loan is almost completely repaid. You can
determine the monthly payment of an amortized loan using an online calcula-
tor, a table of values, or a good, old-fashioned formula. I explain each of these
methods in the following sections.
By the way, the term mortgage is only applied to loans for buildings or prop-
erty. So, while a mortgage is a loan, a loan isn’t necessarily a mortgage.
However, payments and interest on both are figured the same way.
Taking advantage of online calculators
An online calculator is a handy tool for figuring mortgage payments. The
beauty of online calculators is that they take all the mystery and scariness
out of computing mortgage payments, mortgage interest, points, and so on.
Most financial institutions with Web sites offer you the convenience of doing
computations using their particular calculator. You enter the amount of the
loan and any other pertinent information, and the calculator will almost
immediately produce the payment amount and interest rates available. You
can play around with the numbers — see what happens if you want to borrow
more or make a bigger down payment. You get to do your homework before
actually going to the institution to arrange for a loan.
Be aware, though, that you often have to register or provide some sort of per-
sonal information when you use these Web sites. You may get e-mails or
phone calls from the institution, offering to do business with you. 
339
Chapter 22: Taking Out Mortgages and Property-Related Loans

Consulting mortgage payment tables
Visiting an online mortgage calculator (see the previous section) is probably
the quickest method of figuring monthly mortgage payments, but using a
table or chart is quick and efficient as well. It would take a book the size of a
dictionary to list all the possible loan amounts and corresponding interest
rates. But you don’t want to lug around a book. You want something you can
carry in your pocket or wallet. That’s why folks started constructing tables
showing certain interest rates, the number of years of borrowing, and the
amount of the payment per thousand dollars of the loan.
When using a payment table to determine your monthly mortgage payment
amount, you first find the rate down the side of the table and the number of
years across the top. Find the entry corresponding to the rate and years you
want and then multiply by the number of thousands of dollars that you want
to borrow.
In Table 22-1, I show you the monthly payment it would take to amortize a
$1,000 loan. I include interest rates from 4% to 9% in increments of a quarter
of a percent, and loans for 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 years.

Use Table 22-1 to determine the monthly payment of a $200,000 loan at 63⁄4%
interest for 25 years.
To do so, find the row for 63⁄4% interest. Then scan across until you hit the
column for 25 years. At that intersecting cell of the table, you should find the
number 6.909115. That’s the amount of the payment — about $6.91 — that
you’d have to pay every month for 25 years, to repay a loan of $1,000.
Now, to determine the monthly payment for a $200,000 loan, multiply
6.909115 by 200 to get $1,381.823, or about $1,382 each month. (You multiply
by 200, because the loan is for 200 thousand.) Pretty snazzy table, isn’t it?
Interpolating for interest
Say that you want to figure the payment on a $150,000 loan at 51⁄8% interest for
20 years. What do you do in this situation where the interest rate that you want
is some amount between two of the rates given on the table? You interpolate!
Interpolating, as used in mathematics, simply means finding some intermediate
or middle value between two consecutive values that appear in a table. It’s
essentially finding a number between two other numbers. Interpolation isn’t as
good as using a formula or a given table value, but it provides a decent esti-
mate of the number you want.
Use Table 22-1 to determine the monthly payment on a $150,000 loan at 51⁄8%
for 20 years.
To do this, you first determine that 51⁄8% is halfway between 5% and 51⁄4%. Now
you know that you want the payment value that’s halfway between the two
given values on the table. To determine that midpoint, find the difference
341
Chapter 22: Taking Out Mortgages and Property-Related Loans

between the two payment values, take half of that difference, and then add it
to the 5% amount. Here’s what your math should look like:

The payment per $1,000 is 6.6689995, so the payment on a loan of $150,000 is
150 × 6.6689995 = $1,000.349925, or about $1,000.35 per month. Later in this
chapter, I use a formula to determine the payment in this example. This way
you can compare the amounts to see how well interpolation works. Don’t
forget that I said it was a decent estimate. So take it for what it’s worth.
In the previous problem, the percentage needed was halfway between the
values on the table. What if the percentage you want isn’t quite so coopera-
tive? For example, say you want to use Table 22-1 to figure the monthly pay-
ment on a loan of $100,000 at 7.3125% for 30 years.
The first challenge is to determine where 7.3125 belongs in a table that has
fractional percentage rates. The number 71⁄4 = 7.25 and 71⁄2 = 7.5. (Refer to
Chapter 2 for a complete explanation of changing fractions to decimals.) So
where does 7.3125 belong between these two numbers? Is it halfway? One-
third of the way? To determine how far 7.3125 is from 7.25 and 7.5 in the
table, find the percent difference of 7.3125 between the two table entries.
(You can find more information on percent increases and decreases in
Chapter 3.) Your work should look like this:
difference between 7.5 and 7.25
difference between 7.3125 and 7.25

The rate 7.3125% is one-quarter of the way between 71⁄4% and 71⁄2%. So, to find
the monthly payment from the table, you find 1⁄4, or 25%, of the payment
amount between 71⁄4% and 71⁄2%. Then you add that number to the given pay-
ment amount at 71⁄4%. Here’s what your work should look like:

Great work!
Interpolating for time
The entries in Table 22-1 show increments of 5 years going from 10 years to 30
years. It would be nice if all loan lengths fell into neat little categories like this,
but they don’t. Loans are made in other, not so round, yearly amounts. But
don’t worry. You can compute estimates for years other than multiples of five
in much the same way as you compute estimates for interest rates between
those on the table. Check out the following example for some practice.
Suppose a dentist wants to take out a $60,000 loan at 8% interest and have it
paid off the year that she retires, which is 12 years from now. What will the
monthly payments be?
A loan term of 12 years is obviously between 10 years and 15 years. But you
need to know exactly how far between the two entries 12 years is. To find out,
you take the difference between 12 years and 10 years, 12 – 10 = 2, and then
divide that by the difference between 15 years and 10 years:

As you can see, 12 years is 40% of the way between the two column entries.
Now you have to find 40% of the difference between a loan for 10 years and a
loan for 15 years. The payments decrease as the number of years increases,
so the 40% difference is subtracted from the payment at the 10-year level:

Chapter 22: Taking Out Mortgages and Property-Related Loans

The monthly payment is now found by multiplying 11.1022638 by 60 (for
$60,000): 11.1022638 × 60 = 666.13584. So the dentist’s payments are about
$666.14 per month.
Working your brain with 
an old-fashioned formula
You can use an online calculator or a set of tables to find a particular mort-
gage payment (see both methods in action earlier in the chapter). But some-
times you may want to do your own calculating with a simple, scientific
calculator and the appropriate formula. I show you how in this section.
The formula for determining the monthly payment, R, on an amortized loan
of P dollars for t years at an interest rate r is

If the payments are in an increment other than monthly, replace the 12’s in
the formula with the number of times each year the payments are made.
In the earlier section “Interpolating for interest,” I show you how to use
Table 22-1 to estimate the monthly payment for a loan of $150,000 at 51⁄8% for
20 years. I use the formula here to do the same computation.
The loan amount, P, is 150,000; the interest rate, r, is 51⁄8 %, or 0.05125; and the
number of years, t, is 20. So now you just plug all of the numbers into the for-
mula, like so

Whoa! You have to put all that in your little scientific calculator? Well, not all
at once. I take you through the steps that work best. (In Chapter 5, I give
explanations on how to solve formulas, so refer to that chapter if you need
more information than I give here.)
The first step in using the formula is to find the values in the parentheses.
You can then substitute the computed numbers into the parentheses as part
of simplifying the whole thing. This step looks like this:

Your payment comes out to about $1,000.32 per month. This solution is

Not too bad.
Going Off Schedule with Amortized
Loans and Mortgages
Amortized loans are the standard for building mortgages and other property-
related loans. You determine the monthly or yearly (or some other periodic)
payment using either tables or a formula — or you can hit the Internet for an
online calculator. (I show you how to use each of these methods in the earlier
section, “Amortizing Loans with Three Different Methods.”)
But what if you want to go off schedule? What if you want to pay ahead on
your mortgage or make some adjustment to the regular payments? What’s
the end result? Do you save money? And, if you save money by paying ahead
or changing the pattern, is the savings enough to even bother with?
In this section, I show you how to determine what amount of a property
mortgage payment is actually interest, and I explain what effects changing
your payment can make on the end result. Finally, I help you explore the
effect of fiddling with the interest rate. For instance, did you know that by
paying a larger down payment or paying points to the lender, you can realize
345
Chapter 22: Taking Out Mortgages and Property-Related Loans

a significant savings? That’s right! Read on for details. (For more information
on loans that aren’t used for property-related expenses, flip to Chapter 12.)
Determining how much of 
your payment is interest
Lending institutions are required to send out reports to loan-holders telling
them how much interest they paid during the previous year. This practice
helps taxpayers determine how much they can deduct for expenses when fig-
uring their income tax. The amount paid in interest changes every year with
an amortized loan. Why? Because the principal (the amount of the loan)
keeps decreasing as payments are made. So more interest is paid at the
beginning of a loan payback than at the end. (Check out Chapter 9 for more
information on simple and compound interest.)
Figuring total interest paid
By increasing the number of years needed to pay back a property mortgage,
you decrease the monthly payments. This perk is great for the borrower
when money is tight and he doesn’t want to put as much money toward the
expenses. But how does this affect the total amount of money paid back by
the borrower? Will the amount of interest being charged increase signifi-
cantly? Is the amount of the increase great enough to encourage you to look
at other options?
Say that a business owner wants to move into a bigger building, so he borrows
$130,000 at 41⁄4% for 30 years. In this case, his monthly payment is $639.52.
What’s the total amount that the business owner is paying back over the
entire 30-year period, and how much of that is interest?
A monthly payment of $639.52 for 30 years amounts to $639.52 × 30 × 12 =
$230,227.20 as a total payment. If the amount borrowed was $130,000, then
$100,227.20 was paid in interest. (You find the interest by subtracting the
amount borrowed from the total payback: $230,227.20 – $130,000 =
$100,227.20.) That’s a lot of money!
Compare that to the same business owner borrowing the same $130,000 at
41⁄4% for 25 years. The monthly payment goes up to $704.26. The total amount
paid over the 25-year period is $704.26 × 25 × 12 = $211,278. The interest paid
is $211,278 – 130,000 = $81,278. This is still a lot of money, but it’s almost
$20,000 less than the amount that’s paid over the 30 years.

Part VI: Surviving the Math for Business Facilities and Operations 

Computing unpaid balance
After a certain number of mortgage payments, a borrower wants to know the
amount of the unpaid balance — how much is left of the original loan and
how much of the interest is being computed on. Knowing this information is
important for tax purposes and for planning on what can be deducted as
overhead. It also helps the borrower determine whether she needs to take
out an additional loan based on the equity in the property so she can build
an addition and expand her business.
The amount of the unpaid balance of a loan that has a monthly payment of R
dollars at a rate of r percent for t years if x payments have already been made
is found with the following formula:

This formula looks hairy, but don’t worry. The following example will help
you work through the steps.
A small business owner has made 24 monthly payments on an $80,000 mort-
gage at 5% interest over 25 years. Her monthly payments are $467.67. How
much does she have left to pay on her loan? With this figure, she can make
plans for an expansion.
To find out, plug your numbers into the formula, like this:

And, showing you the computation in steps:
You first divide the 0.05 by 12 for both the numerator and denominator;
in the exponent, you multiply the 12 by the 25.
Next, you do the subtraction in the exponent to get –276.
Now you add the 1 to the decimal in the parentheses and raise the result
to the –276 power.
Subtract the result from the parentheses from the 1.
Now simplify the fraction in the bracket by dividing, and finally, multiply
the result of the division by the payment amount. Whew!

The balance is about $76,615.61 on the original $80,000 loan. Even though she
has made payments totaling $467.67 × 24 = $11,224.08, her loan balance has
been reduced by a little more than $3,000. This example illustrates how most
of the first payments on an amortized loan are interest.
Finding out how much of a particular payment is interest
Each monthly payment of an amortized loan has different amounts devoted
to reducing the principal and to paying interest. The percentage of interest in
the first few payments is very high, and the percentage decreases with each
payment. The high interest payments have a tax advantage to a new busi-
ness. How? Well, it allows it to have more to deduct at tax time. To determine
just how much of a particular payment is interest and how much is being
applied to the principal, you need to know what the balance is at a particular
point in time. (In the section “Computing unpaid balance,” you see how to
come up with this number.) 
After you know your balance, you can use the following formula to figure the
amount of interest in a monthly payment: 
I
Pr 12
1
=
c
m
This formula is just the basic interest formula, I = Prt, where P is the principal,
r is the rate of interest, and t is the amount of time (in this case for one
month, so it’s divided by 12).
Suppose Jack, a budding entrepreneur, wants to purchase a building for his
pool-cleaning business. He takes out a loan for $180,000 over 30 years at 7%
interest. His mortgage terms say that he will pay monthly payments. How
much of the payment is interest after one year, and how much of the payment
is interest after 20 years?
First determine the amount of the monthly payment. Using Table 22-1, you do
this by multiplying 6.653025 × 180 = $1,197.54. (If you need help using a table
to determine the monthly payment, spend some time with the earlier section,
“Consulting mortgage payment tables.”)

years (240 payments). Here’s what your math should look like:

After 1 year, the principal is reduced by only about $2,000, and after 20 years,
the principal is down to about $100,000.
Now you just have to compute the amount of interest being paid at each
level. You do this using the formula I introduced earlier in this section:

So, after 1 year of paying almost $1,200 per month, the amount of the pay-
ment going to interest is about $1,039 of that $1,200. After 20 years, the
amount of interest goes down to about $600 — or half the payment. 
Altering the payments
After a loan repayment schedule has been established, the borrower knows
what payment is required each month in order to pay off the loan on time.
Savvy borrowers realize that an awful lot of money goes into paying interest,
so they’ll consider some alternatives — some ways to reduce the total
amount paid back.
Of course, it’s often to the borrower’s advantage to have a lot of interest pay-
ment to deduct. Why? Well, the interest on a loan is a deduction that offsets
the amount of income tax to be paid. The whole process is a bit of a balancing
act between taking advantage of the tax laws and not going overboard with
the amount of money being paid back. (You can read more in Chapter 12.)
For those of you who want to reduce the total amount of money paid back on
an amortized loan, you have several options. All the options, which I explain in
the following sections, revolve around changing the amount of payment, chang-
ing the number of times payments are made, or changing the interest rate.
349
Chapter 22: Taking Out Mortgages and Property-Related Loans

A borrower can change the amount of each of his or her payments by either
increasing the amount by a certain number of dollars or by paying half the
amount twice each month. Both of these methods affect the total amount
paid — one more significantly than the other.
Increasing the dollar amount
A person who borrows $90,000 at 61⁄4% over a period of 25 years has monthly
payments of $593.70. (The earlier section, “Amortizing Loans with Three
Different Methods,” shows you how to figure monthly payments.) Increasing
the amount of the monthly payment will decrease the number of years of
repayment and the total payout. How? Any additional money made in a pay-
ment is applied directly to reducing the principal. If the principal is lower,
then the amount of interest on that lower principal is also smaller. This has a
snowball effect — reducing the principal and the interest month after month.
(In Chapter 12, you find an example of the effect that making larger loan pay-
ments can have.) 
How long will it take a person with a $90,000 mortgage at 61⁄4% for 25 years
to repay her loan if she makes $600 payments (instead of the scheduled
$593.70)? And how much will she save in interest? What about payments of
$625? How will that increase in payment affect the length of time and the
amount of interest?
To be honest, a nice spreadsheet does this figuring pretty well (see Chapter 5
for details), but I have a dandy formula for you to use so you can compute
the amounts with a scientific calculator.
To determine the number of months needed, n, to pay off an amortized loan
whose principal is P, when the rate of interest is r percent, and you’re making
payments of R dollars, use the following formula:
ln
ln
ln
n

The notation ln in the formula represents the natural logarithm. It’s a function
that allows you to solve for a variable that’s in the exponent of a number.
Your scientific calculator has a log button and an ln button. The log button is
for base 10 numbers, and the ln button is for base e numbers. The number e
has a value of approximately 2.71818. You “hit” the ln button, then the
number that you want evaluated, and then enter. 
So, to find the number of months it will take to repay the original 25-year
mortgage if the payments are increased to either $600 or $625, you just plug
the numbers into the formula and solve:

You work from the inside of the parentheses outward. First divide the 0.0625
by 12 in both the numerator and denominator. In the numerator, take that
result, multiply by 90,000, and then subtract the product from 600. Find the ln
of the difference. In the denominator, you add 1 to the division result and find
the ln of that sum. The computations are all based on the order of operations
in formulas which I discuss in great detail in Chapter 5.
Increasing the payments to $600 makes the number of months equal to
292.567, which, when divided by 12 months, comes out to about 24.38 years.
That’s shortening the loan-repayment by about 71⁄2 months. Increasing the
payments to $625 reduces the loan-repayment period to 22.239 years, or
about 22 years, 3 months. The time isn’t decreased much with the additional
$7, but it’s cut by almost three years with payments of $625.
Now, to compare the amount of interest paid, look at the total amount paid
back and the amount of interest paid for each of the three loan payment
amounts:
$593.70
25 years

For each case, find the total payback by multiplying the amount of the pay-
ment times the number of years times 12 months. Then subtract the amount
of the loan from that total payback.
Even a small addition of $7 per month results in a couple thousand dollars
saved in interest payments. Increasing the payment by $32 per month saves
over $11,000 in interest.

Chapter 22: Taking Out Mortgages and Property-Related Loans

Paying more often, but paying half as much
You wouldn’t think that paying twice as often — and half as much — would
make much difference in the total amount repaid on a loan. But it does. If you
don’t believe me, check out the following example.
Consider the borrower in the previous section who borrowed $90,000 at 61⁄4%
interest over 25 years. The monthly payment comes out to be $593.70, and
half of that is $296.85. Paying $296.85 twice a month results in n payments:

Remember that the 6.25% rate is divided by 24 instead of 12, because the bor-
rower pays two payments per month. Now take the number of payments,
599.224 and divide by 24 to get 24.968 years. That’s almost the same 25 years.
So how does the total amount repaid change?
To find out, you multiply the payment amount times the number of years times
24 (the number of payments in 12 months). Here’s what the math looks like:
$296.85

Even this method saves a couple hundred dollars in interest.
Changing the number of payments
A popular method used to repay mortgages on a regular schedule and cut
down the interest paid is to make more payments. If you make the scheduled
payment every four weeks instead of every month, by the end of the year you
will have made one extra payment. For businesses that have unusually good
months or other sources of income, this method makes a lot of sense. See
how the math works out in the following example.
Suppose an advertising firm bought a business retreat in Colorado for hold-
ing client conferences and took out a mortgage of $420,000 at 41⁄2% interest for
20 years. The scheduled monthly payments are $2,657.13. The company
decides to make payments every four weeks. How will this change the length
of the repayment and the amount of interest paid?
To find out how many payments need to be made, you use the formula for
determining that number. Your math will look like this:

At 13 payments per year, 229.249 divided by 13 is about 17.635 years rather

You find the amount of interest paid by determining the total amount of the
payback and subtracting the amount borrowed. The two computations show
you the total paybacks for 20 years and 17.635 years and the amount of inter-
est in each case.
If you subtract the two resulting amounts ($217,711.20 – $189,160.34), you
can see that the borrower will save more than $28,000 in interest.
Showing the effect of lowering the interest rate
In the earlier section, “Paying down using points,” I indicate that by paying
more points at closing you save money in the long run. The scenario in that
section is that a loan of $255,000 at 5.5% interest was to be paid back in 30
years. Paying $6,375 in points reduced the interest rate to 5.1875%. Do the
borrowers really make up the extra $6,375 paid up front if they lower the
interest rate? To compare, you have to find the total payback over 30 years.
What’s the total payback of a $255,000 mortgage at 5.5% compared to the
total for the same amount at 5.1875% when both are for 30 years? Is the differ-
ence greater than $6,375?
Using Table 22-1, the monthly payments for the loan at 5.5% are $1,447.86.
Next, using the formula for monthly payments for the amortized loan at
5.1875%, you get $1,398.26. I got to use the easier method (the table) with the
first computation because the interest rate is a nice, round number. For the
second computation, I had to dig out my calculator. (To get more information
on the methods to figure monthly payments, check out the earlier section,
“Amortizing Loans with Three Different Methods.”)

Chapter 22: Taking Out Mortgages and Property-Related Loans

The difference between the two payments is $49.60. Multiply that difference
by 360 (12 payments per year for 30 years) and the total difference is $17,856.
This total difference is almost three times the extra amount paid in points.
Not too shabby!
Talking about Borrowing Power
Most small businesses have to borrow money at some time or another.
Borrowing money isn’t a bad thing, but it has to be done carefully and with
great forethought. Businesses can borrow money using any of the following
methods:
 A line of credit: Allows the business to borrow funds as needed up to a
prescribed limit.
 A term loan: This loan can be short term or long term and is usually
amortized.
 A credit card: Lets the business purchase merchandise and temporarily
postpone payment.
When a business borrows money, it has to establish that the current and
expected income provides enough cash flow to make the loan payments. The
business should make a yearly model or projection, because a company may
have peaks and valleys in its income during the course of 12 months.
Suppose, for example, a business wants to borrow money to purchase a new
assembling machine. The machine will increase the total income of the com-
pany and allow for future growth into other markets. After doing a study on
the effect of adding the new machine and the projected increases in income,
the business owner determines that the company can allocate $12,500 per
month to repaying a loan for the purchase of the equipment. If the business
can afford to make monthly payments of $12,500 to pay back the loan, how
much money can it borrow if the interest rate is 83⁄4%? Compute this for both
10 years and 15 years.
Using Table 22-1, the payment per $1,000 borrowed at 83⁄4% for 10 years is
12.532675. If you figure a monthly payment by multiplying the number of
thousands of dollars of the loan by the value in the table, then you need to
divide the payment by the number in the table to get the number of thou-
sands of dollars of the loan.
For instance, if you divide $12,500 by 12.532675, you get 997.392815, or
approximately $997,000 that can be borrowed. Using the same process for
15 years, divide $12,500 by 9.994487 to get 1250.689505, which is $1.25 million.
If the machinery has a long life expectancy, the loan seems like a good idea.

Investigating Alternative Loans
Two types of loans that require special handling are contracts for deed and
construction loans. Not all states encourage or even make it easy to purchase
property with a contract for deed. In fact, they often make it very difficult.
A contract for deed puts the responsibility for the amount of the loan on an
individual, the current owner of the property. Lending institutions are usually
more prepared to determine a person’s ability to repay a loan than an individ-
ual who may have a personal connection (a close friend or relative). A con-
tract for deed may be the only way to make a sale possible, though.
A construction loan is pretty standard fare for both businesses and develop-
ers. A construction loan has a predetermined limit, but the total amount isn’t
borrowed all at the same time. Over a period of some months or a year, the
construction costs accumulate until a traditional loan comes into effect.
Taking out a contract for deed
A contract for deed is a contract between the owner of some property and the
person who wants to buy that property. This type of loan is different from a
mortgage with a bank or lending institution because the seller is taking on
the position of lender. The seller and buyer agree to a price and a payment
schedule, and the buyer makes the payments directly to the seller.
A contract for deed is often used if a particular buyer either doesn’t qualify
for a conventional loan or if there just isn’t time for all the paperwork and
processes necessary with a lending institution. Beware, though. There may
be a reason that a business doesn’t qualify for a conventional loan.
Some creative payment plans are often instituted with a contract for deed.
Such plans include interest-only plans and short balloon plans. I explain each
in the following sections.
Interest-only contracts
With an interest-only contract, the buyer is paying the interest on the amount
and not making any dent in the principal. The interest-only part usually takes
place for a specified amount of time. This type of contract may be great tax-
wise, but it leaves the buyer with the full amount to pay back eventually.
However, interest-only contracts also allow the buyer to “own” the property
for a while.
A small business owner is anxious to sell his shop so he can move to another
state. He sells his business on a contract for deed for $85,000. He’s currently
making mortgage payments on a conventional $60,000 loan at 83⁄4% for 25
years. The contract for deed that he’s agreed to is an interest-only contract for
355
Chapter 22: Taking Out Mortgages and Property-Related Loans

2 years at 61⁄4%; at the end of the 2 years, the buyer will pay the full amount —
probably by just getting a conventional loan. How much will the monthly inter-
est payments be, and will the buyer’s payments cover the current owner’s
monthly mortgage payments?
The interest-only payments on $85,000 are computed by multiplying the
$85,000 by the interest rate of 61⁄4% by 1⁄12. Each month, the interest is figured
on the same amount, because the principal isn’t being reduced. Here’s what
the math looks like:
$
,
.

Next figure out the payments that the current owner is making. You can do
this by using Table 22-1. You multiply 8.221436 (the monthly payment) by 60
(the table gives the amount per thousand, and the loan is for 60 thousand) to
get $493.29. (To get more information on using tables to find monthly pay-
ments, check out the earlier section, “Consulting mortgage payment tables.”)
The owner will be paying out more on his loan than he’ll be getting from the
buyer. Sometimes, however, this is acceptable, especially if the owner is in a
hurry.
Balloon payment contracts
A balloon payment contract allows the borrower to pay back a loan, usually
using an amortization schedule for a 25- or 30-year loan, for a certain number
of years — say 5 or 10 years. At the end of the specified time, the entire bal-
ance becomes payable. The buyer either has to take out another loan to
repay the balance — or come up with the entire amount owed.
Balloon contracts are great for fledgling businesses — making the payments
smaller at the beginning. But this is really a gamble — gambling that the situ-
ation will be better in the five or ten years and that the borrower will be in a
position to pay the greater amount of money.
Suppose a couple purchases a fast-food franchise and makes arrangements to
borrow $450,000 at 41⁄2% for 6 months. At the end of six months they’ll make a
balloon payment — pay off the balance of the loan (they won the lottery and
will have the check by then). The payments during the 6 months are based
on a 30-year amortized loan. What’s the total amount that the couple will
pay before making the final, balloon payment, and how much will the balloon
payment be?
Using Table 22-1 and 30 years, you get monthly payments of $2,280.08.
Multiply the monthly payment by six, and their total output comes to
$13,680.50. (For more information on using tables to find monthly payments,
flip to the earlier section, “Consulting mortgage payment tables.”)
The unpaid balance is found using the formula I introduce in the earlier sec-
tion, “Computing unpaid balance.” The formula is

So, as you can see, the couple will have to pay $446,410.23; their 6 months of
payments decreased the principal by about $3,600.
Building a construction loan
A construction loan usually has two parts: an interest-only loan until the con-
struction project is finished and a conventional mortgage loan as soon as
the business owner takes occupancy. The lender needs to know the plans for
construction — the amount of money needed and the timeline. The details
of the loan are worked out based on the construction plans. This type of loan
makes a lot of sense to the builder, because only the amount of money
advanced to a particular point is creating interest. The end total is agreed
upon, and only the amount needed at a particular time is released.
Say, for example, that a $300,000 construction loan is agreed on in which the
construction company pays interest only at 6% for the first 6 months and
then 53⁄4% when the building is occupied and the full amount comes due.
Assuming that the average balance of the borrowed amount is $150,000
during the 6-month construction period, estimate the amount of interest paid
during that first 6 months.
Even though the money needed for construction is probably doled out in
uneven increments during the 6-month period, an estimate is made using the
average amount of $150,000. Just use the simple interest formula, I = prt, to get
I = 150,000(0.06)(1⁄2)
= $4,500
You can read more about simple and compound interest in Chapter 9.

your lease
 Coming to terms with renewing, renegotiating, or breaking leases
T
he biggest question that pops up when you’re faced with the prospect of
needing space is whether to rent or to buy. The plusses and minuses of
both options are special to your particular circumstances. And, if you’re in
the business of renting property to others, you need to know how to best
arrange for a fair, profitable, and manageable situation using a lease.
Leases come in all shapes and sizes. Okay, they’re all printed on paper, but
the terms and specifics of a lease vary as much as the types of properties
they represent. Because of all these variations, it’s always a good idea to get
legal counsel and tax advice before entering into a lease agreement. However,
you can do all the legwork and be more assured of having the arrangement
that you want if you take time to acquaint yourself with the options.
In this chapter, you find all sorts of information about leases. I describe the
most common types of leases: gross leases, net leases, percentage leases, and
step leases. I also explain some of the ways that you can protect your lease,
including clauses, allowances, and security deposits. The different clauses
that can be added to a lease spell out some special terms and protect both the
renter and the property owner. You don’t want any nasty surprises, so it pays
to understand what’s involved with a particular lease and its clauses.
Each type of lease has its own particular advantages and disadvantages. Each
type of lease can be modified to fit the situation. However, do remember that
when bound by any of these arrangements, both the landlord and the tenant
need to be aware of their responsibilities under the terms of the arrangement —
and they must make good on them. Complete and accurate records need be
kept and regular accounting and audits need be scheduled.

Getting the Full Treatment 
with a Gross Lease
With the terms of a gross lease, the landlord receives the gross amount of
money in rent and pays all expenses associated with the property. If you’re
entering into a gross lease as a landlord, you agree to be responsible for all
the expenses that are normally associated with ownership: taxes, mainte-
nance, utilities, insurance, and repairs.
On the other hand, if you’re the renter in a gross lease, you have the advan-
tage of a set monthly payment for all the expenses of housing your business.
In other words, you don’t have to worry about fluctuating utility charges,
changes in your share of the common areas, or increases in taxes.
As you probably know, property owners or landlords are interested in having
their investments in a property grow. They also want to receive a steady
income from that property. Setting a rental amount that provides the income
and is at a level that attracts good tenants is essential to financial success.
When determining a fair rental amount, the landlord takes into account all of
the usual expenses and determines an amount that provides a profit. When
more than one tenant is involved, the landlord must determine each tenant’s
share of any common areas. This share is referred to as the common area
maintenance, or CAM. Other provisions provided in a gross lease include
clauses involving escalation of rent and expense stop provisions. (You can
find more on these provisions later in this chapter. See the sections,
“Stepping It Up with a Step Lease” and “Inserting Expense Provisions into
Your Lease.”
A gross lease is fairly rare. One reason that a gross lease is rarely used is
because the different expenses associated with the rental of part of a building
can vary greatly with different tenants’ usage. For instance, if each office has
a thermostat and heating and cooling isn’t limited or controlled, a tenant may
set the temperature to excessively high temperatures in the winter or exces-
sively cool temperatures in the summer. One tenant may use more in heat,
lights, and water than another, but the kicker is that they all pay the same
amount. This is why an expense stop provision is often used with gross leases.
Similarly, with a gross lease, the expenses are based on projected costs for
garbage and taxes. Parking lot maintenance may be contracted out with a set
amount for a year, but you can’t control what governmental bodies do with
the garbage pickup fees and real estate tax rates. Increases in the real estate
tax don’t usually take effect immediately, so there’s time to adjust accord-
ingly. However, the garbage doesn’t wait. An operating expense escalation
clause may be added to a gross lease to take care of such contingencies.
362
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Using a Single Net Lease to Get Your
Tenant to Share the Expenses
If you thought that a net lease dealt with fishing or butterfly collecting, you’re
going to be slightly disappointed. Instead, with a net lease, the landlord
receives a net sum and the tenant pays for some of the expenses. These
expenses, which are paid by the tenant, can include utilities, repairs, insur-
ance, or taxes. Different types of net leases are defined by the expenses that
are or are not included.
A single net lease, for example, is a net lease where the tenant pays a monthly
amount in rent and the property taxes as well. With this type of lease, the
property owner/landlord is still responsible for all the other expenses, such
as utilities, maintenance, and so on. For instance, the landlord can include a
charge of $200 per month toward the taxes, $600 per quarter, or some such
arrangement. If the landlord deposits this tax payment into a separate
account, the interest can be earned on the payments — quite a bonus!
Even though the tenant is paying the taxes, it’s best to have the tax payment
go through the owner or landlord. That way, the property owner is sure that
the taxes get paid on time. Cities and counties get a bit testy about late or
unpaid property taxes. If your tenant neglects to pay the taxes on time, you’ll
come across penalties and other inconveniences (such as having the tax bill
sold at auction).
Signing a Double or Triple Net Lease
A double net lease is a lease where the tenant pays the monthly set amount
along with the property taxes and property insurance. With a triple net lease,
the tenant pays the property taxes, property insurance, the maintenance,
and the monthly rent. In both situations, the landlord is still responsible for
all the other expenses.
The double and triple net leases are conventional arrangements. But there’s
no reason that you can’t get creative and set up a quadruple net lease, a 
quintuple net lease, or sextuple net lease. (Okay, I went a bit overboard here;
this is beginning to sound like a discussion of multiple births.) In any case, a
properly executed lease can be set up to meet the needs and desires of the
landlord and the tenant. Spelling out all the details in a lease helps avoid con-
fusion as to who’s responsible for what.
363
Chapter 23: Ten Tips for Leasing and Managing Rental Property

Trying Out a Percentage Lease
A percentage lease is arranged to benefit both the landlord and the renter.
The landlord benefits by sharing in the business tenant’s good profits, and
the renter benefits when business is in a slump or down-period. Percentage
leases make sense for businesses that fluctuate with the seasons, but they
also make financial planning difficult. Another downside is this: Even though
a landlord receives more money with a percentage lease when the tenant’s
business is good, the additional revenue may be offset by greater expenses,
such as utilities, if a net lease is in place.
The terms of a percentage lease may require the renter to pay a certain flat
rate per month plus 2 percent of the gross sales for the month. This arrange-
ment works if the added amount is sufficient to cover the added expense of
the increased sales. And a possibility is a rate schedule that includes
increases or decreases determined by the particular level of volume.
Stepping It Up with a Step Lease
A step lease (or escalation lease) makes provisions for the amount of the
lease to increase over a period of time — usually each year, but other
arrangements, such as quarterly or monthly, can also be used.
Over the course of the lease term, the rent can increase at predetermined
amounts. These amounts are negotiated at the beginning of the lease term.
With a step lease, the landlord accepts smaller amounts of money at the
beginning of the term, expecting to benefit from the success of the enterprise
after it takes hold. At the same time, the building is appreciating in value, and
the landlord has a tenant locked in. With a step lease, each step may be the
same over the term of the lease, or it may have unequal steps that reach the
same level in the end.
Real estate values increase over time, and inflation continues to affect the
cost of doing business, so landlords expect to get their fair share. The main
reason a building owner may use a step lease is to allow the renter and owner
to enter into a multiyear contract while, at the same time, making accommo-
dations for yearly increases.
Another reason an owner may choose a step lease is to benefit the tenant.
When a business is first starting up, the business owner prefers to reinvest
money into the business to stimulate its growth (rather than give profits to
the owner or landlord). A landlord can go along with this and protect himself
with a larger security deposit. The step lease, in this situation, allows the
landlord to reap the benefits as the new business takes hold and becomes
more profitable.
364
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Inserting Expense Provisions 
into Your Lease
When you’re entering into a lease as a landlord, you have to be sure to pro-
tect yourself. You can do so by adding specific clauses and provisions. For
example, an expense stop provision protects the landlord from excessive
expenses. And an allowance per foot clause can secure the promise of renova-
tions and cooperation while the renovations or changes are being made.
Expense stop provisions are negotiated when the terms of the lease are being
set. A landlord and renter will negotiate how the issue is to affect the terms of
the lease using historical information regarding the expected expenses for a
particular item.
With the allowance per foot clause, either the improvements are added to the
rental amount because of the increase in utility of the property, or the
amount is decreased due to expected inconveniences. Sometimes, the land-
lord pays for the improvement while the tenant decides how the improve-
ment is made — within the allowance.
A gross lease requires a landlord to pay all the expenses — such as taxes,
maintenance, and utilities (see the earlier section “Getting the Full Treatment
with a Gross Lease”). However, a landlord can protect himself from an overly
high utility expense (whether it’s due to abuse by a tenant, unseasonably
cold or warm weather, or an unexpected utility rate hike) by inserting an
expense stop provision in the lease. The provision should protect the owner,
but should also be fair to the tenant. Utility companies usually offer level 
payment plans to even out spikes in the cost.
Including an Allowance for
Improvements in Your Lease
When negotiating for commercial space, you sometimes want to include
improvements to the property as part of the contract. In some cases, those
improvements are the landlord’s responsibility, and sometimes they’re the
tenant’s responsibility. When the tenant takes on the improvements, he or
she may be able to negotiate a reduction in the rental amount. Of course, the
landlord wants to have some control over the quality of the work being done
and expects all permanent fixtures to be left in place when the tenant leaves.
365
Chapter 23: Ten Tips for Leasing and Managing Rental Property

It’s often more advantageous for the landlord to take on the improvements,
because the landlord has more of a vested interest in the improvement on his
property. One example of such a lease is when a tenant agrees to a 5-year
step lease with a particular cost per square foot of space. If the tenant
requests some improvements to the property, her proposal may include an
extension in the length of the lease. In this case, the owner of the property
needs to weigh the advantage of having the renter for a longer period of 
time — at her terms — versus the cost of the improvement.
Protecting Your Lease with a 
Security Deposit
A security deposit basically acts to cover the landlord’s expenses should a
tenant violate the lease agreement by breaking the lease (not renting for the
full term that was agreed upon) or by not keeping the property in good 
condition — if the wear and tear is greater than what’s normally expected
during the time period of the lease.
When a business has little or no credit history, the landlord may require a
larger security deposit because of the increased risk of default or violation.
On the other hand, if the credit history of a business is strong, the landlord
may waive the security deposit requirement altogether or require only a nom-
inal amount. After a tenant establishes himself as being reliable, he can some-
times negotiate an agreement that allows him to reclaim part or all of the
security deposit.
Assuming all the conditions are met, the challenge here is determining how
much of the security deposit should be returned. Does the added time cover
the cost of the improvements? Is it worth the security of having the tenant for
more time? Other agreements may include having the landlord share the
interest that’s being earned on the security deposit; this would take some
negotiating.
Adding a Sublease Clause 
to Your Commercial Lease
Because commercial leases are typically much longer than residential leases,
it’s usually a good idea to have a sublease clause in your rental contract. A
sublease clause defines whether, as a renter, you’re allowed to find another
renter to take your place — with the same terms that you’ve agreed on with
the landlord. After all, if you need to move to other quarters, you’d probably
366
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

prefer to sublease the current area instead of breaking the contract and
paying the penalties. Most leases contain a clause stating that the landlord
must approve any subtenants; this type of clause also covers all the legal
ramifications in terms of your responsibility and the owner’s responsibility. 
Deciding Whether You Should Renew,
Renegotiate, or Break a Lease
Some tenants want to renew their leases at the end of the current lease term.
Others need to break their lease midway through and not complete the full
term. And other times, a tenant may want to sublease a property as a way of
fulfilling the lease obligation. Sometimes a landlord may even be the one to
break a lease.
All these various contingencies, such as breaking the lease, subleasing, or
even renewing, should be spelled out in the original lease. That way if one of
these occurrences needs to be dealt with, the terms of the lease give direc-
tion on how to handle them.
Remember that the length of a commercial lease is usually much longer than a
residential lease. That means it’s common to see commercial leases that are
up to five or ten years in length as a normal course of business; this length can
add stability and security. But, depending on the type of business you run and
the projected growth, locking yourself into a long lease can cause a conun-
drum for your planning. So if you think that your business has the potential to
outgrow the current space, you need to plan ahead for expansion.
One way to provide for the changes in your situation is to renegotiate the
terms of your lease, taking into account your new needs. This is often the
more acceptable situation — the least disruptive to business. If good terms
can’t be set, or if the current facilities can’t be altered to meet your needs,
you may have to go through the expense of breaking your lease — and
thereby paying a hefty fine to get out of that contract.
For example, consider a company that’s currently halfway through the third
year of a 5-year lease. If that company decides that it needs to expand, it has
to determine whether it’s better to increase the space at a possible premium
rate (if the landlord wants to take advantage of the situation) or to break the
lease, pay the penalty, and move elsewhere. Even though there are multiple
expenses involved in relocating, it may still be the preferred option.

Ten Things to Watch Out for When
Reading Financial Reports
In This Chapter
 Reading a report for insight and understanding
 Watching out for report entries that act as red flags
C
ompanies — especially those that are publicly traded — produce many
different financial statements each year so that their managers, owners,
stockholders, and the IRS have access to the information necessary to make
decisions. Each of the different financial reports has its own specifications
and particular format, and even those formats change with the type of com-
pany and the situation.
This chapter doesn’t educate you on how to read the different financial
forms. Instead, what you find here are some of the things to watch out for
to determine whether more study is necessary if a report isn’t as clear and
forthright as you think it should be. If you’re interested in understanding
how to read financial reports, you can get an explanation with lots of detail
in Reading Financial Reports For Dummies (Wiley).
Apologies for Shortfalls
A corporation’s annual report offers the board of directors the opportunity to
strut their stuff and summarize the past year. They also get to use the report
to show their strategies for the coming year. So if you’re reading the report
and come across an apology (veiled or outright) in the chairman’s letter that
a particular lofty goal wasn’t quite met because of unforeseen events, you
want to investigate further to see just how far the goal was missed by and
how unlikely the event in question may have been. If missing the goal has sig-
nificant impact on the future of the company, then you need to keep an eye
on future developments.

Blurring in the Overall Picture
A company is most happy to report record revenues and successfully-met
sales goals, but is the annual report clear on where that income is being gen-
erated? How and where is the revenue coming from during the year? Are the
different divisions that make up the company clearly defined? It’s fine that
revenue is coming in, but you want to know where the revenue is coming
from and if the result can be replicated.
Wishy-Washy Descriptions of Trends
The management of a company uses various records to determine the financial
situation both past and present. So you should be able to find documentation
concerning the financial trends of the company — whether the financials are
good news or bad news. And that documentation should be written in a clear
and honest discourse. If the report is wishy-washy and uninformative, it’s your
job to find out more. You don’t want vague generalities about the finances; you
want cold, hard facts. If you’re being given noninformation, you need to ask
questions. Are the details available, or are you gently being told that you just
don’t need to know?
An Overabundance of Footnotes
Footnotes are designed to clarify information in a financial report. Beware of
an overabundance of footnotes or of vague references in footnotes. Why?
Because a report is meant to be informative and instructive. Footnotes are
extra bits of information or clarification and shouldn’t contain the meat of
the report. And remember that any time information is pulled away from the
body of a report, you have an interruption of the flow of material. This inter-
ruption isn’t good because it impedes your ability to understand the report
and see the whole picture.
Listings of the Directors
You’ll find a listing of the board of directors in a company’s annual report.
Determine how many directors are on the board. Do you really think that the
number of directors currently on the board is enough? Or do you think that
there are too many? You also may want to read through the directors’ brief
biographies so you can get an idea of who’s sitting on the board and what
370
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

their agendas may be. By looking at their histories, do you think that the
directors represent a wide range of experience and corporate responsibility,
or are they all apparent buddies of the president? A wide range of experience
provides a more global perspective — not everyone is looking at the com-
pany with the same preparation and background. Buddies of the president
may be more forgiving of errors and missteps; you want directors who are
more objective.
A family-owned business may have an overabundance of people with the
same last name serving on the board. Keeping it in the family may be fine, but
you need to delve further if you think that undue influence could be hurting
the company.
Uncollected Revenues
In a company’s balance statement, you’ll find entries for the receivables,
which is the income not yet collected for goods purchased or services pro-
vided. Does the amount in accounts receivable seem a bit high compared to
previous periods of time or comparable companies? Does the company seem
to have an awful lot of uncollected revenue? If so, the company may be
exposing itself to potentially bad debts at a higher-than-needed scale. Ask
questions of the company representatives to see if they have plausible rea-
sons for the situation.
A High Working Capital
When reading a company’s cash flow statement, be wary of especially large
amounts of working capital (money just sitting there — items produced and
warehoused but not sold). A big number in the working capital entry may
mean that inventory isn’t being moved out as quickly as it should be. And if
inventory isn’t moving out at an appropriate rate, then sales are probably
stagnating, and that will affect revenue in the future.
Long-Term Debt
Many companies use loans to help their businesses grow. And why not?
Borrowing makes good business sense as long as the amount is reasonable
and the projected payback is doable. Having said that, beware of a company
with a large amount of long-term debt. Having to pay interest on long-term
debt tends to cut into a company’s cash flow.

Chapter 24: Ten Things to Watch Out for When Reading Financial Reports

Low Profit Margins
A profit margin is the difference between the revenue generated and the cost
required to generate that revenue. In general, the larger the profit margin, the
safer the investment. On the other hand, a low margin can be risky. For exam-
ple, a company operating at a 4% profit margin is quickly in trouble if the
sales decline by 4% or more. You should expect the profit margin to increase
over time, which is accomplished by increasing sales at a faster rate than the
expenses incurred while generating those sales.
Warning Words
Financial reports are full of numbers, and unfortunately, numbers can lie. In
Chapter 8, for example, I show you how to lie with statistics. (Okay, I don’t
show you how to actually lie, but I do show you how it can be done.) Numbers
can be slippery fellows, but so can words. So watch for the hidden meanings
when you see words and phrases like challenging, undertaking corrective mea-
sures, adjustments, and significant difficulties. When you see challenging, does it
mean something that the company is looking forward to facing or something
that has dragged the financial situation downward? Corrective measures may
be slight adjustments to take care of changes in the financial climate, or
they may be huge layoffs or firing of employees who have done some harm.
Adjustments can mean just about anything — look for what the adjustments
refer to in the financial picture. And significant difficulties isn’t included in a
financial statement unless something significant really has happened. Delve
further — something is afoot.
You want the reports to be honest and to include the bad news along with
the good, but be wary of the company trying to gloss over certain pertinent
information.
