Note from the Series Editor
This book is the latest contribution to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) Space Science and Tech-
nology Series. This series is a companion series of the ongoing Deep Space Communications and
Navigation Systems (DESCANSO) Series and includes disciplines beyond communications and
navigation. DESCANSO is a Center of Excellence formed in 1998 by the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA) at JPL, which is managed under contract by the California Insti-
tute of Technology.
The JPL Space Science and Technology series, authored by scientists and engineers with many
years of experience in their fields, lays a foundation for innovation by sharing of state-of-the-art
knowledge, fundamental principles and practices, and lessons learned in key technologies and
science disciplines. We would like to thank the Interplanetary Network Directorate at JPL for their
encouragement and support of this series.

Foreword
I am pleased to commend the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) Space Science and Technology Series
and to congratulate and thank the authors for contributing their time to these publications. It is
always difficult for busy scientists and engineers, who face the constant pressure of launch dates
and deadlines, to find the time to tell others clearly and in detail how they solved important and
difficult problems, so I applaud the authors of this series for the time and care they devoted to doc-
umenting their contributions to the adventure of space exploration. In writing these books, these
authors are truly living up to JPL’s core value of openness.
JPL has been NASA’s primary center for robotic planetary and deep-space exploration since the
Laboratory launched the nation’s first satellite, Explorer 1, in 1958. In the years since this first suc-
cess, JPL has sent spacecraft to each of the planets, studied our own planet at wavelengths from
radar to visible, and observed the universe from radio to cosmic ray frequencies. Even more exciting
missions are planned for the next decades in all these planetary and astronomical studies, and these
future missions must be enabled by advanced technology that will be reported in this series. The
JPL Deep Space Communications and Navigation book series captures the fundamentals and
accomplishments of those two related disciplines, and this companion Science and Technology
Series expands the scope of those earlier publications to include other space science, engineering,
and technology fields in which JPL has made important contributions.
I look forward to seeing many important achievements captured in these books.

Preface
Since the 2008 publication of the 1st edition of this book, the field of electric propulsion has
exploded with thousands of electric thrusters now operating on Earth-orbiting satellites and ion
and Hall thrusters having been successfully used for propulsion in deep-space science missions.
The recent emergence of large constellations of communications satellites and a new generation
of Earth observation satellites has greatly expanded the use of electric propulsion in space. In addi-
tion to these applications of electric propulsion technology, research and development has greatly
expanded worldwide in universities, laboratories, and industry. Electric propulsion has arrived as a
vibrant, growing field.
The 1st edition was intended to alleviate the community’s dependence on empirical investiga-
tions and laboratory-based development programs for electric thruster invention and advances
by presenting fundamental physics models to explain the behavior and scaling of ion and Hall
thrusters. This required communicating a basic knowledge of plasma physics, cathodes, ion accel-
erators, electrical discharges, high voltage, gas dynamics, and plasma-surface interactions. As such,
the 1st edition helped to educate a new generation of engineers and scientists interested in working
in this field.
In the meantime, progress in the field and emerging applications have pushed researchers to con-
tinue to improve existing technologies and to develop new thrusters, which often requires complex
multi-dimensional modeling to predict the plasma dynamics that drive the performance and life of
these thrusters. The role of physics-based models and simulations in the design, development, and
flight qualification of electric thrusters is now well accepted. The 2nd edition of this book retains
much of the material of the 1st edition and captures progress in this field over the past 15 years
especially with respect to hollow cathodes, modeling and simulation, and the discovery and imple-
mentation of magnetic shielding that has revolutionized Hall thrusters. We are fortunate to include
Dr. Ioannis G. Mikellides as a coauthor of the 2nd edition to contribute his extensive expertise in
these areas. The 2nd edition also includes new chapters on electromagnetic thrusters and future
directions in electric thruster research and development. Work in this field is progressing rapidly,
and we hope this new edition of the book will lead to further research and advances in our under-
standing of these surprisingly complex devices.
While this book encompasses a large body of literature in the area of electric thrusters, it is based
largely on the research and development performed at the JPL. Therefore, this book should not be
considered an all-inclusive treatise on the subject of electric thrusters or a review of their develop-
ment history. Rather, this effort delves further into the fundamentals of some of the modern electric
rockets that are finding increasingly more applications in an attempt to provide a better under-
standing of their principles.

Chapter 1
Introduction
Electric propulsion (EP) is an in-space propulsion technology aimed at achieving thrust with high
exhaust velocities, which results in a reduction in the amount of on-board propellant required for a
given space mission or space propulsion application compared to other conventional propulsion
methods. Reduced propellant mass can significantly decrease the launch mass of a spacecraft or
satellite, leading to lower costs from the use of smaller launch vehicles to deliver a desired mass
into orbit or to a deep space target. Alternatively, the reduced propellant mass enabled using EP
can be used to increase the delivered payload mass on a given launch vehicle.
In general, EP encompasses any propulsion technology in which electricity is used to increase the
propellant exhaust velocity. There are many figures of merit for electric thrusters, but mission and
application planners are primarily interested in thrust, propellant flow rate or specific impulse, and
total efficiency in relating the performance of the thruster to the delivered mass and change in the
spacecraft velocity (Δv) during thrusting periods. Although thrust is self-explanatory, specific
impulse (Isp) is defined as the mean effective propellant exhaust velocity divided by the gravita-
tional acceleration constant g, which results in the unusual units of seconds. The total efficiency
is the jet power produced by the thrust beam divided by the electrical power into the system. Nat-
urally, spacecraft designers are then concerned with providing the electrical power that the thruster
requires to produce a given thrust, as well as required propellant flow, and in dissipating the ther-
mal power that the thruster generates as waste heat.
In this book, the fundamentals of EP are presented. There is an emphasis on ion and Hall thrus-
ters that have emerged as leading EP technologies in terms of performance (thrust, Isp, and effi-
ciency) and use in space applications, but other thrusters such as electromagnetic thrusters are
also described. Ion and Hall thrusters operate in the power range of hundreds of watts up to tens
of kilowatts with an Isp of thousands of seconds to tens of thousands of seconds, and produce thrust
levels of a fraction of a Newton to over a Newton. Ion and Hall thrusters generally use heavy inert
gases such as xenon or krypton as propellants, but other propellant materials, such as cesium and
mercury, have been investigated in the past. Xenon is generally preferable because it is not hazard-
ous to handle and process, it does not condense on spacecraft components that are above cryogenic
temperatures, its large mass compared to other inert gases generates higher thrust for a given input
power, and it is easily stored at densities of about 1 g/cm3 with low tank mass fractions. Krypton is
also an emerging propellant that is cheaper than xenon and provides slightly higher Isp (due to its
lower mass) than xenon for a given thruster electrical configuration. Electromagnetic thrusters can
use nearly any propellant, but tend toward lower atomic mass to improve performance and Isp.
However, this book will primarily focus on xenon as the propellant in ion and Hall thrusters,

1.1
Electric Propulsion Background
A detailed history of EP up to the 1950s was published by Choueiri [1], and information on devel-
opments in EP since then can be found in reference books [2] and on various internet sites [3].
Briefly, EP was first conceived by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky [4] in Russia in 1903 and independently
by Robert Goddard [5] in the United States in 1906 and Hermann Oberth in Germany [6] in 1929.
Several EP concepts for some space applications were published in the literature by Shepherd and
Cleaver in Britain in 1949. The first systematic analysis of EP systems was made by Ernst Stuhlinger
[7] in his book Ion Propulsion for Space Flight published in 1964, and the physics of EP thrusters was
first described comprehensively in the book by Robert Jahn [8] in 1968. The technology of early ion
propulsion systems that used cesium and mercury propellants, along with the basics of low-thrust
mission design and trajectory analysis, was published by George Brewer [9] in 1970. Since that time,
the basics of EP and some thruster characteristics have been described in several chapters of text-
books published in the US on spacecraft propulsion [10–13]. An extensive presentation of the prin-
ciples and working processes of several electric thrusters was published in 1989 in a book by
S. Grishin and L. Leskov [14] (in Russian). A survey of the early flight history of ion propulsion
projects in the US was published by J. Sovey et al. [15] in 1999.
Significant EP research programs were established in the 1960s at NASA’s Glenn Research Cen-
ter (GRC), Hughes Research Laboratories (HRL), NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and at
various institutes in Russia to develop this technology for satellite station keeping and deep space
prime propulsion applications. The first experimental electric thrusters were launched into orbit in
the early 1960s [15] by the United States (US) and by Russia. The US demonstrated the first
extended operation of ion thrusters in orbit with the Space Electric Rocket Test (SERT-II) mission
[16] launched in 1970. The SERT-II mercury ion thrusters were also the first to use a hollow cathode
“plasma-bridge neutralizer” to provide complete ion beam neutralization in space. Experimental
test flights of ion thrusters and Hall thrusters continued from that time into the 1990s.
A detailed description of flight electric thrusters, with performance information and photos, is
given in Chapter 12. Briefly, the first extensive application of EP was by Russia using Hall thrusters
for station keeping on weather and communications satellites [17]. Since 1971, when the Soviets first
flew a pair of SPT-60s on the Meteor satellite, over 250 SPT Hall thrusters have been operated on
dozens of satellites to date [18]. Japan launched the first ion thruster system intended for north–south
station keeping on the communications satellite “Engineering Test Satellite (ETS) VI” in 1995 [19].
However, a launch vehicle failure did not permit station keeping by this system, but the ion thrusters
were successfully operated in space. The first commercial use of ion thrusters in the United States
started in 1997 with the launch of a Hughes Xenon Ion Propulsion System (XIPS) [20], and the first
NASA deep space mission using the NSTAR ion thruster was launched in 1998 on Deep Space-1 [21].
Since then, Hughes/Boeing launched their second generation 25-cm XIPS ion thruster system [22]
in 2000 for station keeping applications on the high power 702 communications satellite [23].
The Hughes/Boeing 702 spacecraft is the first satellite to use electric thrusters for all propulsion appli-
cations (orbit raising, station keeping, momentum management, and attitude control).
The Japanese Space Agency (JAXA) successfully used the μ10 ion thrusters to provide the prime
propulsion for the Hayabusa asteroid sample return mission [24] launched in 2003, and an
2
1 Introduction

upgraded version of this microwave ion thruster [25] was used for prime propulsion on Hayabusa-2
launched in 2014. The European Space Agency (ESA) used the Safran manufactured PPS-1350-G
Hall thruster on its SMART-1 mission to the moon [26] also in 2003.The Russians have been stead-
ily launching communications satellites with Hall thrusters aboard since 1971, and will continue to
use these devices in the future for station keeping applications [18]. The first commercial use of Hall
thrusters by a US spacecraft manufacturer was in 2004 on Space Systems Loral’s (SSL) MBSAT,
which used the Fakel SPT-100 [27]. ESA launched the QinetiQ/UK T5 ion thruster on the GOCE
mission [28] in 2009. This was followed in 2010 with the launch of Aerojet’s BPT-4000 Hall thruster
[29] (now called the XR-5) on the AF/LMC AEHF satellite. ESA launched the QinetiQ manufac-
tured T6 ion thruster [30] on the BepiColombo mission to Mercury in 2018. SSL launched its first
spacecraft that used the 4.5 kW Fakel SPT-140 Hall thruster [31] in 2018 for orbit raising and station
keeping. The first spacecraft that did not utilize any chemical propulsion (no kick-stage thruster for
orbit insertion or chemical thrusters for orbit maintenance) was the Boeing’s “all-electric” 702SP sat-
ellite [32] launched in 2015. NASA/GRC’s NEXT ion thruster was flight demonstrated in 2021 on the
DART mission [33]. Additional ion and Hall thruster launches are ongoing now for emerging LEO
communications constellations, such as the thousands of SpaceX Starlink launches each with a Hall
thruster used for orbit insertion and station keeping. This trend will continue going forward using var-
ious thrusters produced by commercial vendors, with Hall thrusters dominating the present market.
In the past 25 years, EP use in spacecrafts has grown steadily worldwide [34, 35], and advanced
electric thrusters have emerged [36] for scientific missions and as a competitive alternative to chem-
ical thrusters for station keeping and orbit raising applications in geosynchronous communication
satellites. Rapid growth has occurred in the last 10 years in the use of ion thrusters and Hall thrus-
ters in commercial communications satellites to reduce the propellant mass for station keeping and
orbit insertion. The US, Europeans, and the Russians have now flown thousands of electric
thrusters on communications satellites and will continue to launch more ion and Hall thrusters
in the future. The use of these technologies for primary propulsion in deep space scientific applica-
tions has also been increasing over the past 15 years. There are many planned launches of new EP
spacecraft, especially for the emerging LEO communications constellations and for challenging
scientific missions, that use ion and Hall thrusters as the acceptance of the reliability and cost
benefits of these systems grow.
1.2
Electric Thruster Types
Electric thrusters are generally described in terms of the acceleration method used to produce the
thrust. These methods can be easily separated into three categories: electrothermal, electrostatic,
and electromagnetic. Electrothermal thrusters are not discussed in this book, except for a brief
description below, because the technology is very mature and covered in previous books [8],
and the performance is relatively low compared to other types of electric thrusters. Common elec-
tric thruster types are:
1.2.1
Resistojet
Resistojets are electrothermal devices in which the propellant is heated by passing through a resis-
tively heated chamber or over a resistively heated element before entering a downstream nozzle.
The increase in exhaust velocity is due to the thermal heating of the propellant, which limits the Isp
to low levels (<500 s).
1.2 Electric Thruster Types
3

1.2.2
Arcjet
An arcjet is also an electrothermal thruster that heats the propellant by passing it through a high
current arc in line with the nozzle feed system. Although there is an electric discharge involved in
the propellant path, plasma effects are insignificant in the increase of the exhaust velocity because
the propellant is very weakly ionized. The Isp is limited by thermal heating to less than about 700s
for easily stored propellants.
1.2.3
Electrospray/FEEP Thruster
These are two types of electrostatic EP devices that generate very low thrust (<1 mN). Electrospray
thrusters extract ions or charged droplets from conductive liquids fed through small needles and
accelerate them electrostatically with biased, aligned apertures to high energy. Field Emission Elec-
tric Propulsion (FEEP) thrusters transport liquid metals (typically indium or cesium) along needles,
extracting ions from a “Taylor-cone” on the sharp tip by field emission processes. Owing to their
very low thrust, these devices are used primarily for precision control of spacecraft position or atti-
tude in space, but are now being pursued for CubeSat and small sat applications. Electrospray/
FEEP thrusters are not discussed further in this edition because a book specifically on micropro-
pulsion thrusters has previously been published [37].
1.2.4
Ion Thruster
Ion thrusters employ a variety of plasma generation techniques (DC discharge, rf discharge, micro-
wave discharge, arcs, etc.) to ionize a large fraction of a gaseous propellant. These thrusters then
utilize biased grids to electrostatically extract ions from the plasma and accelerate them to high
velocity by voltages typically ranging from 1 to 2 kV, but which can even exceed 10 kV in laboratory
thrusters. A hollow cathode positioned external to the thruster and grids provides electrons to neu-
tralize the beam. Ion thrusters feature the highest efficiency (60 to >80%) and very high-specific
impulse (2000 to over 10,000 s) compared to other thruster types.
1.2.5
Hall Thruster
This type of thruster utilizes an E × B cross-field discharge described by the Hall effect to generate
the plasma. An electric field is established perpendicular to an applied radial magnetic field to
electrostatically accelerate ions to high exhaust velocities. The transverse magnetic field causes
the electrons to move in cycloidal orbits around an axisymmetric discharge channel (the “Hall
current”), and inhibits electron motion axially toward the anode to create a resistivity in the plasma
that supports the ion accelerating electric field. Although the force is transferred from the ions to
the thruster through the magnetic field, these are classified here as electrostatic thrusters because
the unmagnetized ions are accelerated electrostatically. Hall thruster efficiency and specific
impulse is typically somewhat less than that achievable in ion thrusters, but the thrust at a given
power is higher, the power density is higher, and the device is much simpler and requires fewer
power supplies to operate. Recently, advanced Hall thrusters have begun utilizing a more complex
magnetic field shape near the discharge channel exit called “Magnetic Shielding” that eliminated
wall erosion and enabled Hall thrusters with lifetimes in excess of 50,000 h.
1.2.6
Magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) Thruster
These electromagnetic devices use a very high current arc to ionize a significant fraction of the pro-
pellant, and then use electromagnetic forces (Lorentz J × B forces) in the plasma discharge to accel-
erate the charged propellant. Since both the current and the magnetic field are usually generated by
4
1 Introduction

the plasma discharge, MPD thrusters tend to operate at very high currents and high powers to gen-
erate sufficient force and thereby also generate high thrust compared to the other technologies
described above. Since MPD thrusters tend to run at lower discharge voltages (<100 V) to avoid
significant electrode erosion, they tend to use light atoms as propellant (H2, Li and Ar) to achieve
longer life at higher Isp.
1.2.7
Pulsed Plasma Thruster (PPT)
A PPT is an electromagnetic thruster that utilizes a pulsed discharge to ionize a fraction of a solid
propellant ablated by a plasma arc, and then uses the electromagnetic Lorentz J × B force generated
in the pulsed plasma to accelerate the ions to high exit velocity. PPTs that produce the order 1 mN of
thrust at an Isp of over 1000 s have been flown at an average input power of about 100 W. The dis-
charge pulse is short (tens of μsec) to avoid arc damage, and the repetition rate is typically used to
determine the average thrust level.
1.2.8
Pulsed Inductive Thruster (PIT)
Like the PPT, the PIT is another electromagnetic thruster that operates in pulsed mode. However,
its operational principle is distinctly different making it truly unique among all other mainstream
electromagnetic thrusters. For example, the Lorentz force is produced inductively and, therefore,
the PIT does not require electrodes. Also, in principle, it can operate with a wide range of gaseous
propellants, although a single-shot operation has shown optimal performance with polyatomic
molecule fuels. For example, a PIT operating with ammonia at 4.6 kJ per pulse demonstrated nearly
constant efficiencies exceeding 50% at the range of specific impulse 4000 s < Isp < 8000 s. Its pro-
pensity to work best with such polyatomic fuels renders the thruster as a potentially ideal candidate
for a water-propellant operation.
Some of the operating parameters of chemical and electric thrusters, most with flight heritage,
are summarized in Table 1-1.There are many other types of EP thrusters in development or merely
conceived that are too numerous to be described here, some of which are described in Chapter 10.
This book will focus on the fundamentals of electrostatic and electromagnetic thrusters as
outlined in the next section.

Electrostatic Thrusters
1.3.1
Ion Thrusters
An ion thruster consists of basically three compo-
nents: the plasma generator, accelerator grids,
and the neutralizer cathode. Figure 1-1 shows a
schematic cross section of an electron bombard-
ment ion thruster that uses an electron discharge
with a magnetic field produced by permanent
magnets at the surface of the anode to generate
the plasma. The discharge from the cathode to
the anode generates the plasma in this thruster,
and ions from the discharge chamber region flow
to the grids and are accelerated to form the thrust
beam. The plasma generator is at high positive
voltage compared to the spacecraft or space
plasma, and so is enclosed in a “plasma screen”
biased near the spacecraft potential to eliminate
electron collection from the space plasma to the
positively biased surfaces. The neutralizer cathode is positioned outside the thruster and provides
electrons at the same rate as the ions in the beam to avoid charge imbalance with the spacecraft.
A photograph of the NEXT ion thruster developed at NASA/GRC [39] is shown in Fig. 1-2. This
thruster is capable of operating at 0.5–6.9 kW with a maximum Isp of 4000 s. Ion thrusters that use

1 Introduction

alternative plasma generators, such as microwave or rf plasma generators, have the same basic
geometry with the plasma generator enclosed in a plasma screen and coupled to a gridded ion accel-
erator with a neutralizer cathode. The performance of the thruster depends on the plasma generator
efficiency and the ion accelerator design.
1.3.2
Hall Thrusters
A Hall thruster can also be thought of as consisting of basically three components: the cathode,
the discharge region, and the magnetic field generator. Figure 1-3 shows a schematic cross-
section of a Hall thruster. In this example, a cylindrical insulating channel encloses the discharge
region. Magnetic coils induce a radial magnetic field between the center pole piece and the flux
return path at the outside edge. The cathode of the discharge is an internal centrally mounted
hollow cathode, although external cathodes mounted outside the thruster body are also used.
The anode is a ring with some structure to evenly distribute the propellant gas in the annular
channel, and is located at the base of the cylindrical discharge channel. Gas is fed into the dis-
charge channel through the anode and dispersed into the channel. Electrons attempting to reach
the anode encounter a transverse radial magnetic field, which reduces their mobility in the axial
direction and inhibits their flow to the anode. The electrons tend to spiral around the thruster axis
in the E × B direction and represent the Hall current from which the device derives its name. Ions
generated by these electrons are accelerated by the electric field from the anode to the cathode poten-
tial plasma produced at the front of the thruster. Some fraction of the electrons emitted from the
hollow cathode also leave the thruster with the ion beam to neutralize the exiting charge. The shape
and material of the discharge region channel and the details of the magnetic field determine the per-
formance of the thruster.
Figure 1-4 shows a photograph of a SPT-100 Hall that has extensive flight experience on Russian
communications satellites [17]. This thruster, described in Chapter 12, has redundant externally
mounted hollow cathodes and oper-
ates nominally [40] at a power of
1.35 kW and an Isp of 1600 s. The
thruster includes a redundant hollow
cathode to increase the reliability
and features a lifetime in excess of
9000 h.The SPT-100 has also been
flown on US commercial communi-
cations satellites [27].

1.4.1
Magnetoplasmadynamic Thrusters
Magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) thrusters [8] are high-power devices that produce thrust using the
Lorentz electromagnetic force. The basic configuration consists of a centrally mounted cathode, a
cylindrical or conical anode isolated from the center cathode, and for applied field thrusters mag-
netic field coils positioned outside the anode. Figure 1-5 shows an illustration of a typical MPD

1 Introduction

thruster design with these components. The cath-
ode can consist of a refractory metal rod as shown
in the figure, an assembly of refractory metal rods
for more current capability, or a hollow cathode
configuration, depending on the discharge current
and cathode life desired. Current flowing in the
cathode generates a “self-field” azimuthal mag-
netic field, and the radial component of the dis-
charge current to the anode interacting with this
azimuthal magnetic field generates axial thrust
from the Lorentz force. This generation of trans-
verse magnetic fields and plasma currents are
inherent to all of the electromagnetic thruster con-
cepts that use the Lorentz force to generate thrust.
In MPD thrusters with external coils, the
“applied” magnetic field contributes to the Lorentz
force and changes the plasma structure near the
anode. There are also other forces on the plasma
due to the complex structure of the magnetic fields
and the current distributions, which are described in Chapter 9. MPD thrusters typically run in
the multi-kiloamp, tens to hundreds of kilowatts power range, and scale well to over a megawatt
in a compact, high-power package. An example of a laboratory self-field MPD thruster is shown
in Fig. 1-6. There has been extensive research and development internationally on MPD thrusters,
but to date only technology demonstration pulsed MPDs have been flown in space.
1.4.2
Pulsed Plasma Thrusters
The first electric thruster to provide spacecraft attitude control in space was an electromagnetic
pulsed plasma thruster (PPT). This thruster concept uses an arc discharge across two electrodes that
ablates and vaporizes solid propellant feed into a channel. The transverse plasma current in the arc
and the induced magnetic field produces a J × B force that generates thrust out of the system.
Figure 1-7 shows a simple schematic of a PPT thruster, and Fig. 1-8 shows a photograph of the
PPT that flew on the Earth Observing (EO-1) Mission in 2000 [41]. PPTs are inherently pulsed
devices to avoid damage to the electrodes and generate the desired amount of propellant into
the system, and produce the order of 1 mN of
thrust at an Isp of over 1000 s with an average
input power of the order of 100 W. PPTs are
now a commercial product and have flown
recently in microsatellite applications.

Pulsed Inductive Thrusters

pulsed

thrusters
(PIT)
[42, 43] are electromagnetic accelerators in
which energy is stored capacitively and dis-
charged through an inductive coil. First, the

release of the energy stored in the capacitors. The
strong azimuthal electric field produced in this
mannerbreaks down the propellant and estab-
lishes an azimuthal current that interacts with
the rising radial magnetic field to accelerate the
plasma along the thruster axis to high exhaust
velocities. Such inductive acceleration, illustrated
in Fig. 1-9, avoids the need for electrodes, the ero-
sion of which has typically been the life-limiting
process of traditional electromagnetic thrusters.
Another unique benefit of the PIT is that it can
potentially operate and perform well with any
propellant, including water. Single-shot operation
has demonstrated optimum performance with
polyatomic molecule fuels such as ammonia
which is plentiful and easily stored. Moreover, this
thruster can maintain constant Isp and thrust effi-
ciency over a wide range of input power by vary-
ing the pulse rate to maintain a constant discharge
energy per pulse. PITs can also have a high energy
per pulse, and by increasing the pulse rate they
can operate at very high power levels producing
high thrust from a single thruster. The first labo-
ratory investigations of this accelerator were, in
fact, performed in the late 1960s at Thompson Ramo Wooldridge Inc. (TRW) and continued later
at Northrop Grumman Space Technology in the 1980s and 1990s [45]. It was not until the emer-
gence of a renewed interest in high power EP in the early 2000s, however, that those largely

1 Introduction

empirical investigations were complemented by more in-depth analytical modeling and the first
detailed 2-D numerical simulations [44, 46].
1.5
Beam/Plume Characteristics
The ion beam exiting the thruster is often called the thruster plume, and the characteristics of this
plume are important in how the exhaust particles interact with the spacecraft. Figure 1-10 shows
the generic characteristics of a thruster plume. First, the beam has an envelope and a distribution
of the ion currents in that envelope. Second, the energetic ions in the beam can charge exchange
with neutral gas coming from the thruster or the neutralizer, producing fast neutrals propagating
in the beam direction and slow ions. These slow ions then move in the local electric fields asso-
ciated with the exit of the acceleration region and the neutralizer plasma, and can backflow into
the thruster or move radially to potentially bombard any spacecraft components in the vicinity.
Third, energetic ions are often generated at large angles from the thrust axis either due to edge
effects (fringe fields) in the acceleration optics of ion thrusters, large gradients in the edge of the
acceleration region in Hall thrusters, or scattering of the beam ions with the background gas.
Finally, the thruster evolves impurities associated with the wear of the thruster components. This
can be caused by the sputtering of the grids in ion thrusters, the erosion of the ceramic channel
in Hall thrusters, or the evolution of cathode materials or sputtering of other electrodes in the
engines. This material can deposit on spacecraft surfaces, which can change surface properties such
as emissivity, transparency, etc.
The plume from an electric thruster typically has a complex structure. For example, Fig. 1-11
shows an exploded view of a calculated three-dimensional plume from a three-grid ion thruster.
In this case, the ion beam is shown as the extended plume and the molybdenum atom plume
escaping through the third grid from sputter erosion of the center-accel grid is shown by the wider
angular divergent dark plume and several beam lobes of high-angle particle fluxes. Likewise, Hall

1.5 Beam/Plume Characteristics

thruster plumes start from a conical discharge chan-
nel and merge downstream to form the thrust beam,
and are characterized by a larger angular divergence
of high-energy ions than typical from ion thrusters.
Since the energetic ions in the thruster plume tend
to sputter surfaces that they come into contact with,
and metal or impurity atoms from the thruster tend
to deposit and coat surfaces they come in contact
with, the net interaction of these plumes with the
spacecraft is very different from that encountered
when using on-board chemical propulsion systems,
and the spacecraft interactions must be examined
with 3-D codes that include the spacecraft layout
coupled to these types of thruster plume plots. Tech-
niques and models for doing this are described in
detail in Chapter 11.

1 Introduction

Chapter 2
Thruster Principles
Electric thrusters propel the spacecraft using the same basic principle as chemical rockets of
accelerating mass and ejecting it from the vehicle. The ejected mass from electric thrusters, how-
ever, is primarily in the form of energetic charged particles. This changes the performance of the
propulsion system compared to other types of thrusters and modifies the conventional way of cal-
culating some of the thruster parameters such as specific impulse and efficiency. Electric thrusters
provide higher exhaust velocities than available from gas jets or chemical rockets, which improves
either the available change in vehicle velocity (called Δυ or delta-υ), or increases the delivered
spacecraft and payload mass for a given Δυ. Chemical rockets will generally have exhaust velocities
of 3–4 km/s, whereas the exhaust velocity of electric thrusters can approach 102 km/s for heavy
propellant such as xenon atoms, and 103 km/s for light propellants such as helium.
2.1
The Rocket Equation
The mass ejected to provide thrust to the spacecraft is the propellant, which is carried onboard the
vehicle and expended during thrusting. From conservation of momentum, the ejected propellant
mass times its velocity is equal to the spacecraft mass times its change in velocity. The “rocket equa-
tion” [1] that describes the relationship between the spacecraft velocity and the mass of the system
is derived as follows. The force on a spacecraft, and thus the thrust on the vehicle, is equal to the
mass of the spacecraft, M, times its change in velocity υ:
Force = T = M dυ
dt
(2.1-1)
The thrust on the spacecraft is equal and opposite to time rate of change of the momentum of the
propellant, which is the exhaust velocity of the propellant times the time rate of change of the pro-
pellant mass:
T = −d
dt mpυex
= −υex
dmp
dt ,
(2.1-2)
where mp is the propellant mass on the spacecraft and υex is the propellant exhaust velocity in the
spacecraft frame of reference.
The total mass M of the spacecraft at any time is the delivered mass, md, plus the propellant mass:
M t = md + mp
(2.1-3)

The mass of the spacecraft changes because of consumption of the propellant, so the time rate of
change of the total mass is
dM
dt = dmp
dt
(2.1-4)
Substituting Eq. 2.1-4 into Eq. 2.1-2 and equating with Eq. 2.1-1 gives
M dυ
dt = −υex
dM
dt ,
(2.1-5)
which can be written as
dυ = −υex
dM
M
(2.1-6)
For motion in a straight line, this equation is solved by integrating from the spacecraft initial veloc-
ity υi to the final velocity υf, during which the mass changes from its initial value md + mp to its final
delivered mass md:
υf
υi
dυ = −υex
md
md + mp
dM
M
(2.1-7)
The solution to Eq. 2.1-7 is
υi −υf = Δυ = υex ln md + mp
md
(2.1-8)
The final mass of a spacecraft delivered after a given amount of propellant has been used to achieve
the specified Δυ is
md = md + mp e −Δυ υex
(2.1-9)
The specific impulse, Isp, will be shown in Section 2.3 to be equal to the propellant exhaust velocity,
υex, divided by the gravitational acceleration g. The change in velocity of the spacecraft is then
Δυ = Isp ∗g ln md + mp
md
= Isp ∗g ln Mi
Mf
,
(2.1-10)
where Mi is the initial mass, Mf is the final mass, and g is the acceleration by gravity = 9.8067 m/s2.
Equation 2.1-10 shows that for a given mission with a specified Δυ and final delivered mass md,
the initial spacecraft wet mass (md + mp) can be reduced by increasing the Isp of the propulsion
system, which has implications on the launch vehicle size and cost. High delta-v missions are often
enabled by electric propulsion because it offers much higher exhaust velocities and Isp than con-
ventional chemical propulsion systems.
Equation 2.1-9 can be written in terms of the required propellant mass
mp = md eΔυ υex −1 = md eΔυ
Isp ∗g −1
(2.1-11)
The relationship between the amount of propellant required to perform a given mission and the
propellant exhaust velocity (or the propulsion system Isp) indicates that the propellant mass
increases exponentially with the delta-υ required. Thrusters that provide a large propellant exhaust
velocity compared to the mission Δυ will have a propellant mass that is only a small fraction of the
initial spacecraft wet mass.
16
2 Thruster Principles

The exhaust velocity of chemical rockets is limited by the energy contained in the chemical bonds
of the propellant used; typical values are up to 4 km/s. Electric thrusters, however, separate the
propellant from the energy source (which is now a power supply) and thus are not subject to
the same limitations. Modern ion and Hall thrusters operating on xenon propellant have exhaust
velocities in the range of 20–40 km/s and 10–30 km/s, respectively.
The dramatic benefits of the high exhaust velocities of electric thrusters are clearly seen from
Eq. 2.1-11. For example, consider an asteroid rendezvous mission in which it is desired to deliver
500 kg of payload with a mission Δυ of 5 km/s. A spacecraft propelled by a chemical engine with a
3 km/s exhaust velocity, corresponding to an Isp of 306 s, would require 2147 kg of propellant to
accomplish the mission. In contrast, an ion thruster with a 30 km/s exhaust velocity, corresponding
to an Isp of 3060 s, would accomplish the same mission using only 91 kg of propellant. High delta-υ
missions such as this are often enabled by electric propulsion, allowing either a significant reduc-
tion in the amount of required propellant that has to be launched, or the ability to increase the
spacecraft dry mass for a given wet mass associated with a launch vehicle or mission requirement.
2.2
Force Transfer in Electric Thrusters
The propellant ionized in electric thrusters is accelerated by the application of electric and magnetic
fields. However, the mechanism for generating the thrust and transferring the force from the ion
motion to the thruster body, and thereby the spacecraft, is different for ion thrusters, Hall thrusters,
and electromagnetic thrusters.
2.2.1
Ion Thrusters
In ion thrusters, ions are produced by a plasma source and accelerated electrostatically by the field
applied between two (or more) grids, as illustrated in Figure 2-1. The voltage applied between the
two grids creates a vacuum electric field between the grids of the applied voltage divided by the gap
d. The ions represent additional charge qi in the gap between the grids that modifies the electric
field. Assuming infinitely large grids, the electric field distribution
between the grids can be found from the one-dimensional Poisson’s
Equation:
dE x
dx
= ρ x
εo
= qni x
εo
(2.2-1)
where εo is the permittivity of free space, ρ is the ion charge density in the
gap, q is the ion charge, ni is the ion number density in the gap. Equa-
tion 2.2-1 can be integrated from the screen grid to the accel grid to give
E x = q
εo
x
0
ni x dx + Escreen
(2.2-2)
where Escreen is the electric field at the screen grid. Assuming that the
screen grid is a perfect conductor, its surface charge density, σ, is
σ = εoEscreen
(2.2-3)

2.2 Force Transfer in Electric Thrusters

The surface charge is an image charge and is attracted by the ion charge in gap. Since the field drops
to zero inside the conductor, the screen grid experiences a force per unit area equal to the charge
density times the average field (which is half the field on the outside of the conductor):
Fscreen = σ Escreen + 0
2
= 1
2 εoE2
screen,
(2.2-4)
where Fscreen is the force per unit area on the screen grid. Correspondingly, at the accelerator grid
there is an electric field, Eaccel, and a surface charge density equal to that on the screen grid but of
the opposite sign. The accel grid feels a force per unit area in the opposite direction:
Faccel = −σ Eaccel + 0
2
= −1
2 εoE2
accel
(2.2-5)
The net thrust on the ion engine is the sum of the forces on the screen and accel grids,
T = Fscreen + Faccel A = 1
2 Aεo E2
screen −E2
accel ,
(2.2-6)
where T is the thrust in Newtons and A is the area of the grids. The force per unit area on the ions in
the gap between the grids can be calculated using the fact that the force on an ion equals its charge
times the local electric field, and by integrating that force across the gap:
Fions = q
d
0
ni x E x dx
(2.2-7)
Eliminating the ion density ni(x) using Eq. 2.2-1, the integral can be done directly:
Fions = εo
d
0
dE x
dx
E x dx = 1
2 εo E2
accel −E2
screen
(2.2-8)
The net force on the grids, which is the thrust, is equal and opposite to the electric field forces on the
ions between the grids:
T = −Fions A = −1
2 Aεo E2
accel −E2
screen
(2.2-9)
Therefore, the thrust in an ion engine is generated by the applied elec-
tric field and transferred by the electrostatic force between the ions and
the two grids.
2.2.2
Hall Thrusters
In Hall thrusters, the ions are generated in a plasma volume in
the discharge channel and accelerated by an electric field in the
plasma. The transverse magnetic field in the thruster increases
the axial resistivity and the electric field in the plasma accelerates
the ions to high velocity, and is responsible for the rotational Hall cur-
rent that modifies the force transfer mechanism. Assume, for argu-
ment, that the Hall thruster plasma is locally quasi-neutral
(qni ≈qne) in the acceleration region, where ne is the electron plasma
density, and that in the acceleration zone the electric and magnetic fields
are uniform. The geometry is shown schematically in Figure 2-2.

2 Thruster Principles

The ions are essentially unmagnetized and feel the force of the local electric field, so the total force on
the ions is
Fion = 2π
qniE rdr dz
(2.2-10)
The electrons in the plasma feel an E × B force and circulate in the system transverse to the electric
and magnetic fields with a velocity
ve = E × B
B2
(2.2-11)
The electrostatic force on the ions is the negative of the electrostatic force on the electrons because
of their sign difference. The electrons are constrained to not move axially by the transverse mag-
netic field, so the force per unit area on the electrons (going to the left in Figure 2-2) is balanced by
the Lorentz force:
Fe = −2π
qneE rdrdz −2π
qneve × B rdrdz = 0
(2.2-12)
Using quasi-neutrality and the definition of the Hall current density JHall = −qneυe in Eq. 2.2-12,
and substituting this result into Eq. 2.2-10, the force on the ions is then equal to the Lorentz force on
the electrons
Fi = 2π
JHall × B rdrdz
(2.2-13)
Integrating Eq. 2.2-13 around the cylinder gives the total force on the ions
Fi = JHall × B
(2.2-14)
By Newton’s second law, the Hall current force on the magnets is equal and opposite to the Hall
current force on the electrons and, therefore, is also equal and opposite to the force on the ions:
T = JHall × B = −Fi
(2.2-15)
Therefore, the thrust force in Hall thrusters is transferred from the ions to the thruster body
through the electromagnetic Lorentz force. These thrusters are sometimes called electromagnetic
thrusters because the force is transferred through the magnetic field. However, since the ions are
accelerated by the electrostatic field (like ion thrusters), we chose to call them electrostatic
thrusters.
2.2.3
Electromagnetic Thrusters
Electromagnetic thrusters use the Lorentz force combined with internal pressure gradients to pro-
duce thrust. This can be shown by looking the momentum equation and assuming there is a quasi-
neutral (ni ≈ne = n) plasma in the thruster composed of only electrons and singly-charged ions. We
will neglect viscous effects that are usually small, and also neglect the momentum stored in the
electron fluid because the electron mass is small compared to the ion mass. The fluid momentum
equation for each species is given by
mn dv
dt = mn ∂v
∂t + v ∇v
= qn E + v × B −∇p −mnν v −vo
(2.2-16)
2.2 Force Transfer in Electric Thrusters
19

where the convective derivation is shown, viscosity is neglected, and the Lorentz force term is:
FL = q E + v × B
(2.2-17)
The momentum change from collisions can be written as
Pie = −Pei = mnν vi −ve ,
(2.2-18)
where vi – ve represents the velocity difference between the electrons and ions, and conservation of
momentum between the two species makes the collision terms equal and opposite. The 1-D equa-
tions of motion for ions and electrons are then
Mni
dvi
dt = eni E + vi × B −∇pi −Pie
(2.2-19)
0 = −ene E + ve × B −∇pe + Pei
(2.2-20)
Using quasi-neutrality, solving Eqs. 2.2-19 and 2.2-20 for the collision terms, and using Eq. 2.2-18
gives
Mn dvi
dt = eni E + vi × B −∇pi −ene E + ve × B −∇pe
(2.2-21)
Defining the total pressure gradient and the ion density as
∇p = ∇pi + ∇pe,
ρ = Mn,
(2.2-22)
we write the fluid equation of motion as
ρ dvi
dt = en vi −ve × B −∇p = J × B −∇p
(2.2-23)
where the difference in the ion and electron velocities has been expressed in terms of the net current
density
J = en vi −ve
(2.2-24)
Equation 2.2-23 reduces to the Lorentz force term, expressed as J × B, and a pressure gradient term
found in conventional rockets. The primary cause of the acceleration is the electric field that drives
the current between cathode and anode. This discharge current generates the magnetic field, or
interacts with the transverse component of any applied magnetic field, which results in the
Lorentz force producing thrust. Electrons that are accelerated by the electric field also transfer
momentum to neutrals and ions through collisions that result in heating, which also contributes
(to a lesser extent) to the thrust.
2.3
Thrust
Thrust is the force transferred by the engine to the spacecraft. Since the spacecraft mass changes
with time due to the propellant consumption, the thrust is given by the time rate of change of the
momentum, which can be written as:
T = d
dt mpυex = dmp
dt υex = mpυex,
(2.3-1)
where mp is the propellant mass flow rate in kg/s. The propellant mass flow rate is
mp = QM,
(2.3-2)
where Q is the propellant particle flow rate (in particles per sec) and M is the particle mass.
20
2 Thruster Principles

The kinetic thrust power of the beam, called the jet power, is defined as
Pjet
1
2 mpυ2
ex
(2.3-3)
Using Eq. 2.3-1, the jet power is then
Pjet = T2
2mp
(2.3-4)
This expression shows that techniques that increase the thrust without increases in the propellant
flow rate will result in an increase in the jet power.
For ion and Hall thrusters, ions are accelerated to high exhaust velocity using an electrical power
source. The velocity of the ions greatly exceeds that of any unionized propellant that may escape
from the thruster, so the thrust in one direction T’ can be described as
T = dmp
dt υex ≈mpυi,
(2.3-5)
where mi is the ion mass flow rate and υi is the ion velocity. By conservation of energy, the ion
exhaust velocity is given by
υi =
2qV b
M ,
(2.3-6)
where Vb is the net voltage through which the ion was accelerated, q is the charge, and M is the ion
mass. The mass flow rate of ions is related to the ion beam current Ib by
mi = IbM
q
(2.3-7)
Substituting Eqs. 2.3-6 and 2.3-7 into Eq. 2.3-5, the thrust for a singly charged propellant (q = e) is
T =
2M
e Ib
Vb Newtons
(2.3-8)
Thrust is proportional to the beam current times the square root of the acceleration voltage. In the
case of Hall thrusters, there is a spread in beam energies produced in the thruster, and Vb represents
the effective or average beam voltage. If the propellant is xenon,
2M e = 1 65 × 10 −3, and the
thrust is given by
T xenon = 1 65 Ib
V b mN ,
(2.3-9)
where Ib is the beam current in Amperes and Vb is the beam voltage in Volts. If the propellant is
krypton,
2M e = 1 32 × 10 −3, and the thrust is given by
T krypton = 1 32 Ib
Vb mN ,
(2.3-10)
which, of course, is slightly lower than that for xenon for the same beam current and voltage due to
the lighter atom mass.
Equation 2.3-8 is the basic thrust equation that applies for a unidirectional, singly ionized, mono-
energetic beam of ions. The assumption of a monoenergetic ion beam is generally valid for ion
thrusters, but is only an approximation for the beam characteristics in Hall thrusters, which will
be discussed in Chapter 7. This equation must be modified to account for the divergence of the ion
beam and the presence of multiply charged ions commonly observed in electric thrusters.
2.3 Thrust
21

This modification to Eq. 2.3-8 has been done in the ion thruster literature by introducing a cor-
rection factor γ in the thrust equation. The thrust correction factor is the product of the divergence
and multiply charged species terms:
γ = α Ft
(2.3-11)
The correction to the thrust for beam divergence, Ft, is straightforward for a beam that diverges
uniformly on exiting from the thruster. For a thruster with a constant ion current density profile
accelerated by uniform electric fields, the correction to the force because of the effective thrust-
vector angle is simply
Ft = cos θ,
(2.3-12)
where θ is the average half-angle divergence of the beam. If the thrust half angle is 10 , then
cosθ = 0.985, which represents a 1.5% loss in thrust. If the plasma source is not uniform and/or
the accelerator grids have curvature, then the thrust correction must be integrated over the beam
and grid profiles. For cylindrical thrusters, the current-weighted correction factor is then
Ft =
r
o
2πJ r cos θ r dr
Ib
,
(2.3-13)
where Ib is the total beam current, J(r) is the ion current density which is a function of the radius.
The ion current density is usually determined from direct measurement of the current distribution
in the plume by plasma probes. For a constant value of J(r), Eq. 2.3-13 reduces to Eq. 2.3-12.
A more rigorous approach for finding the divergence correction factor is to calculate the momen-
tum-weighted average divergence angle [2]. Assuming an axisymmetric beam and integrating over
a hemispherical surface through the plume, the divergence correction factor is given by
Ft = cos θ

where m θ is the mass flux at the half-angular position θ in the beam and J(θ) is the ion current
density which is a function of the angle in these coordinates. The momentum-weighted average
angular divergence can be approximated as the charge-weighted average divergence in an axisym-
metric plume [2], which enables probe current measurements in the plume to be used in evaluating
Eq. 2.3-13.
The correction to the thrust for the presence of multiply charged ion species in the beam, α, is
found by considering the force imparted by each species. If the beam contains both singly-charged
and doubly-charged ions such that the total beam current is
Ib = I + + I ++ ,
(2.3-15)
where I + is the singly-charged ion current and I ++ is the doubly-charged ion current, the total
thrust for the multiple species, Tm, is the sum of the thrust from each species:

α = Tm

(2.3-17)
where T is given by Eq. 2.3-8. A similar correction factor can be easily derived for even higher
charged ions, although the number of these species are typically found to be relatively small in most
ion and Hall thrusters.
The total corrected thrust is then given by
T = γmυi = γ
2M
e Ib

(2.3-18)
The total thrust for xenon can be simply written as
TXe = 1 65 γ Ib
Vb mN
(2.3-19)
For example, assuming an ion thruster with a 10 half angle beam divergence with a 10% doubles-
to-singles ratio results in γ = 0.958. For a thruster producing 2 A of xenon ions at 1500 V, the thrust
produced is 122.4 mN.
Likewise, the total thrust for krypton is given by
TKr = 1 32 γ Ib
Vb mN
(2.3-20)
For the same example of an ion thruster running at 2 A and 1500 V in krypton, assuming a 10 half-
angle beam divergence with a 10% doubles-to-singles ratio (γ = 0.958), the thrust produced is
97.9 mN.
2.4
Specific Impulse
Specific impulse, termed Isp, is a measure of thrust efficiency and is defined as the ratio of the thrust
to the rate of propellant consumption. Isp for constant thrust and propellant flow rate, is
Isp =
T
mp g ,
(2.4-1)
where g is the acceleration of gravity = 9.807 m/s2. For a xenon thruster, the Isp can be expressed as
Isp = 1 037 × 106
T N
Q sccm = 1 02 × 102
T N
Q mg s ,
(2.4-2)
where Eq. 2.3-2 and the flow conversions in Appendix B have been used.
Using Eq. 2.3-1 for the thrust in Eq. 2.4-1, the Isp for any thruster is
Isp = υi
g ,
(2.4-3)
where υex is an effective exhaust velocity.
Defining the Isp in terms of the exhaust velocity relative to g is what gives rise to the unusual units
of seconds for Isp. In electric thrusters, the thrust is due primarily to the ions. Using Eq. 2.3-5, the
Isp is given by
Isp = υi
g
mi
mp
,
(2.4-4)
where υi is the exhaust velocity for unidirectional, monoenergetic ion exhaust.

The thruster mass utilization efficiency, which accounts for the ionized versus unionized propel-
lant, is defined for singly-charged ions as
ηm = mi
mp
= Ib
e
M
mp
(2.4-5)
In the event that the thruster produces a significant number of multiply charged ions, the expres-
sion for the propellant utilization efficiency must be redefined. For thrusters with both singly and
doubly charged ions, the corrected mass utilization efficiency for multiple species is
ηm∗= αm
Ib
e
M
mp
,
(2.4-6)
where αm is a term that accounts for the fact that a doubly-charged ion in the beam current carries
two charges but only one unit of mass. In a similar manner as the derivation of the thrust correction
due to double ions, the mass utilization correction αm is given by
αm = I + + 1
2 I ++
I + + I ++
= 1 + 0 5 I ++
I +
I + + I ++
I +
(2.4-7)
For a small ratio of double-to-single ion content, αm is essentially equal to one.
Substituting Eq. 2.3-18 for the thrust and Eq. 2.4-5 for the propellant utilization efficiency into
Eq. 2.4-3 yields an expression for the Isp:
Isp = γηm
g
2eV b
M ,
(2.4-8)
where the propellant utilization efficiency for singly charged ions must be used because Eq. 2.3-18
defines the beam current this way, and again the effective beam voltage must be used for Hall thrus-
ters. Using the values for g and e, the Isp for an arbitrary propellant is
Isp = 1 417 × 103 γηm
V b
Ma
,
(2.4-9)
where Vb is the beam voltage in Volts and Ma is the ion mass in atomic mass units
[1 AMU = 1.6605 × 10−27 kg]. For xenon, the atomic mass Ma = 131.29, and the Isp is given by
IspXe = 123 6 γηm
V b
(2.4-10)
Using our previous example of a 10 half-angle beam divergence and a 10% doubles-to-singles ratio
with a 90% propellant utilization of xenon (in Eq. 2.4-5) at 1500 V, the Isp is (123.6)(0.958)(0.9)
1500 = 4127 s.
For krypton, the atomic mass Ma = 83.798, and the Isp is given by
IspKr = 154 8 γηm
Vb
(2.4-11)
Using our previous example of a 10 half angle beam divergence and a 10% doubles-to-singles ratio
with a 90% propellant utilization of xenon (in Eq. 2.4-5) at 1500 V, the Isp is (154.8)(0.958)(0.9)
1500 = 5169 s. Comparing with our example in the previous section for the same ion thruster
example, the thrust decreased by 20% using krypton instead of xenon, but the Isp increased by 25%.
Isp is functionally equivalent to gas mileage in a car. Cars with high gas mileage typically don’t
provide much acceleration, just as thrusters with high Isp don’t provide as much thrust for a given
input electrical power. Of critical importance is the ratio of the thrust achieved to total power used,
which depends on the electrical efficiency of the thruster (to be described in the next section).

2 Thruster Principles

2.5
Thruster Efficiency
The mass utilization efficiency, defined in Eq. 2.4-5, describes the fraction of the input propellant
mass that is converted into ions and accelerated in the electric thruster. The electrical efficiency of
the thruster is defined as the beam power Pb out of the thruster divided by the total input power PT:
ηe = Pb
PT
=
IbVb
IbVb + Po
,
(2.5-1)
where Po represents the other power input to the thruster required to create the thrust beam. Other
power will include the electrical cost of producing the ions, cathode heater or keeper power, grid
currents in ion thrusters, etc.
The cost of producing the ions is described by an ion production efficiency term, sometimes called
the discharge loss
ηd = Power to produce the ions
Current of ions produced = Pd
Ib
,
(2.5-2)
where ηd has units of watts per ampere (W/A) or equivalently electron-volts per ion (eV/ion). Con-
trary to most efficiency terms, it is desirable to have ηd as small as possible since this represents a
power loss. For example, if an ion thruster requires a 20 A, 25 V discharge to produce 2 A of ions in
the beam, the discharge loss is then 20 ∗25/2 = 250 eV/ion.
The performance of a plasma generator is usually characterized by plotting the discharge loss
versus the propellant utilization efficiency. An example of this is shown in Figure 2-3. At low pro-
pellant efficiencies, the neutral pressure in the thruster is high and the performance curves are rel-
atively flat. As the propellant efficiency is increased, the neutral pressure in the thruster decreases,
the electron temperature increases, and the loss mechanisms in the thruster become larger. Thrus-
ters are normally operated near the knee of this curve such that high mass utilization efficiency is
achieved without excessive discharge loss. Optimized thruster designs result in lower discharge
losses and low loss at high propellant efficiency.

2.5 Thruster Efficiency
25

The total efficiency of an electrically powered thruster is defined as the jet power divided by the
total electrical power into the thruster:
ηT = Pjet
Pin
(2.5-3)
Using Eq. 2.3-4 for the jet power, the efficiency of any electric propulsion thruster is
ηT =
T2
2mpPin
(2.5-4)
Measurements made of the thruster’s input electrical power, input mass flow rate, and thrust out-
put (measured in the vacuum system by a thrust stand) during testing can be used to calculate the
total efficiency of the thruster using Eq. 2.5-4. This is the preferred technique for determining effi-
ciency of Hall thrusters because the beam parameters (current and velocity) are not known outright
from measurements of electrical or gas flow parameters external to the vacuum system.
In ion thrusters, the beam is nearly monoenergetic, the exhaust velocity can be found from the
net acceleration voltage applied to the thruster (using Eq. 2.3-6), and the beam current is measured
by the high voltage power supply. This allows the total efficiency to be accurately calculated from
the electrical and gas flow inputs to the thruster. Using Eq. 2.3-18 for the thrust, Eq. 2.3-6 for the
exhaust velocity, and Eq. 2.4-5 for the propellant flow rate, the total efficiency in Eq. 2.5-4 can be
written as
ηT = γηm Tυi
2miPin
= γ2ηm
IbVb
Pin
(2.5-5)
The input power into the thruster, from Eq. 2.5-1, is
Pin = Pb
ηe

ηe
,
(2.5-6)
Substituting Eq. 2.5-6 into Eq. 2.5-5 gives:
ηT = γ2ηeηm
(2.5-7)
Measurements of the input propellant flow rate and electrical parameters (currents and voltages),
and knowledge of the thrust correction factors from thruster plume measurements or code predic-
tions, permit the total efficiency of ion thrusters to be calculated using Eq. 2.5-7. The electrical and
mass utilization efficiencies are readily available for ion thrusters during testing from the external
electrical signals and flow measurements. In Hall thrusters, however, the beam current and voltage
are not directly proportional to the applied voltage and current, and so additional efficiency terms
are normally included in the total efficiency expression to describe these effects. These terms will be
described in Chapter 7.
Using our previous example of an ion thruster with 10 half-angle divergence, 10% double ion
current, 90% mass utilization efficiency, and 250 eV/ion to produce a 2 A beam at 1500 V, the elec-
trical efficiency is
ηe =
2 ∗1500
2 ∗1500 + 250 ∗2 = 0 857,
and the total efficiency is
ηT = 0 958 2 0 857
0 9 = 0 708,
26
2 Thruster Principles

which indicates that the thruster converts 70.8% of the supplied electrical energy into useful kinetic
energy imparted to the spacecraft.
Thrusters with high exhaust velocities, and thus high Isps, are desirable to maximize a mission
payload mass. It was shown in Eq. 2.4-9 that to achieve high Isp, it is necessary to operate at a high
ion acceleration voltage and high mass utilization efficiency. Reductions in ion mass also increase
the Isp, but at the cost of thrust at the same power level. This is seen by examining the thrust to total
input power ratio. The total power is just the beam power divided by the electrical efficiency, so the
thrust to power ratio using Eq. 2.5-1 is
T
PT
= Tηe
Pb
(2.5-8)
The beam power is the beam current times the beam voltage. Using Eq. 2.3-18 for the thrust and
Eq. 2.4-8 to put this in terms of Isp, the thrust per unit input power is
T
PT
= 2γ2ηmηe
g Isp
= 2
g
ηT
Isp
(2.5-9)
The thrust to power ratio ultimately is determined by the total efficiency and the Isp of the thruster.
High thrust to power ratio is best obtained at lower Isp, which we will see later is more obtainable in
Hall thrusters than ion thrusters.
Equation 2.5-9 can be rearranged to show how the total power is distributed in an electric
thruster
PT = T Isp g
2ηT
(2.5-10)
This shows that for a given input power and total thruster efficiency, increasing the Isp reduces the
thrust available from the electric engine. This trade of thrust for Isp at a constant input power can
only be improved if higher efficiency thrusters are employed.
2.6
Power Dissipation
The power into a thruster that does not result in thrust must be dissipated primarily by radiating the
unused power into space. If the thruster electrical efficiency is accurately known, the dissipated
power is simply
Pdissipated = Pin 1 −ηe
(2.6-1)
If the electrical efficiency is not well known, alternative techniques can be used to determine the
dissipated power. For example, in an ion thruster, the power in the beam is well known, and a sim-
ple difference between the total input power and the beam power represents the dissipated power.
The various input powers can be measured externally to the thruster on the power supplies.
Using ion thrusters for this example, assuming the heaters have been turned off and the hollow
cathodes are self-heating, the power into the ion thruster is given by the power into each compo-
nent (described in Chapter 5):
Pin = IbVb + IdVd + IckVck + InkV nk + IA1 Vb + Va + IA2V a + IDE1Vb + IDE2VG,
(2.6-2)
where the subscript “b” represents the beam current and voltage, “d” is the discharge current and
voltage, “ck” is the cathode keeper current and voltage, “nk” is the neutralizer keeper current and
2.6 Power Dissipation
27

voltage, “A1” represents beam ions incident on the accel grid, “A2” represents charge exchange ions
at the accel grid potential, Va, “IDE1” represents the decel grid (if present) current from beam ions,
and “IDE2” represents the decel grid current from backstreaming ions from the beam plume. In real-
ity, the accel and decel grid power are very small compared to the other power levels in the thruster.
The power that must be dissipated by the thruster is Eq. 2.6-2 minus the beam power:
Pdissipated = IdVd + IckVck + InkVnk + IA1 V b + Va + IA2Va + IDE1Vb + IDE2VG
(2.6-3)
Using the same ion thruster example used previously in this chapter producing a 2 A beam at
1500 V as an example, Table 2-1 shows some example electrical parameters for a generic ion
thruster. Assuming 10% of the grid currents are due to direct interception, using the table para-
meters in Eq. 2.5-12 gives a dissipated power of 528.3 W. Since the discharge power in this example
is 500 W, the other power levels are relatively insignificant. However, the thruster will have to be of
sufficient size to radiate all this power to space at a reasonable temperature that the materials
and construction are designed to handle.
Unlike ion thrusters, power dissipation in Hall thrusters is not easily obtained from the external
power supply readings. However, two techniques can be used to estimate the dissipated power.
First, the dissipated power can be inferred from measurements of the thruster efficiency and the
beam power (ion current and energy), which involves calculating the difference between the total
beam power and the input electrical power. Another technique is to assume that the dissipated
power is primarily the loss due to the electron current flowing from the exterior cathode through
the thruster to the high voltage anode. If the fraction of the discharge current that becomes beam
ions can be determined from the external diagnostics, then the difference between the discharge
current and beam current times the discharge voltage is approximately the dissipated power. This
technique neglects the ionization power and energy carried by the electrons in the beam and so is
only a rough estimate. Hall thruster efficiency and performance useful in determining the power
dissipation is described in detail in Chapter 7.

2 Thruster Principles

2.7
Neutral Densities and Ingestion
In electric propulsion thrusters, the propellant is injected as a neutral gas into a chamber or region
where ionization takes place. Accurately knowing the flow rate of the propellant gas is important in
determining the performance and efficiency of the thruster, and allows the operator to find the
impact of finite pumping speed of test chambers on the thruster operation. The gas flow into the
thruster, which is sometimes called the throughput, is often quoted in a number of different units.
The most common units are standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm) for ion thrusters and mg/s
for Hall thrusters. Additional flow rate units include atoms per second, equivalent amperes, and torr-
liter per second. Conversion factors between these systems of flow units are derived in Appendix B.
The neutral pressure in the thruster discharge chamber or in the vacuum system follows the
standard gas law [3, 4]:
PV = NkT,
(2.7-1)
where P is the pressure in Pascals, V is the volume, N is the number of particles, k is Boltzmann’s
constant (1.38 × 10−23 W/s/K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin. Since there are 133.32 Pascals
per Torr, the number density of the neutral gas is
n = PT Torr 133 32 Pascal Torr
1 38 × 10 −23 J
K ∗T K
= 9 66 × 1024 PT
T

m3
,
(2.7-2)
where PT is the pressure in the vacuum system in Torr and T is the gas temperature in Kelvin. It
should be noted that the pressure must be corrected for the gas type in whatever measurement sys-
tem is used to obtain the actual pressure data. As an example, for a pressure of 10−6 Torr and a
temperature of 290 K, the density of gas atoms is 3.3 × 1016 per cubic meter.
The pressure in a vacuum system [5] in which a thruster is being tested is determined by the gas
flow rate and the pumping speed
P = Q
S ,
(2.7-3)
where Q is the total propellant throughput and S is the pumping speed. The most common units for
pumping speed are liters per second, so utilizing a throughput in Torr-l/s directly provides the pres-
sure in the vacuum system in Torr. The conversions of different flow units to Torr-l/s can be
obtained from Appendix B.
The finite pressure in the test vacuum system causes a backflow of neutral gas into the thruster that
may artificially improve the performance. This ingestion of facility gas by the thruster can be calcu-
lated if the pressure in the chamber is known by evaluating the flux of neutral gas from the chamber
into the thruster ionization region. The equivalent flow into the thruster is then the injected flow
Q plus the equivalent ingested flow. The ingested flow (in particles per second) is given by
Qingested = nc
4 A ηc,
(2.7-4)
where n is the neutral density in the chamber, c is the average gas thermal velocity, A is the total
open area fraction of the thruster to the vacuum system, and ηc is a correction factor related to
the conductance into the thruster from the vacuum system. The neutral gas density is given by
Eq. 2.7-2, and the gas thermal velocity is given by
c =
8kT
πM,
(2.7-5)
2.7 Neutral Densities and Ingestion
29

where M is the atom mass in kg. The conductance correction factor ηc is sometimes called the
“Clausing Factor” [6] and describes the conductance reduction due to the finite axial length of
the effective entrance aperture(s) to the thruster. This factor is generally negligible for Hall thrus-
ters but appreciable for the apertured grids of ion thrusters. Owing to the large diameter-to-length
ratio of the accelerator grid apertures in ion thrusters, the Clausing factor is usually calculated by
Monte-Carlo gas flow codes. An example of a simple spreadsheet Monte-Carlo code for calculating
the Clausing factor for ion thruster grids is given in Appendix G.
The ingested flow of gas from the finite pressure in the vacuum system is then
Qingested = 133 2 P
4kT

(2.7-6)
This expression for the ingested flow can be re-written as

sccm ,
(2.7-7)
where P is the vacuum chamber pressure in Torr, T is the backflowing neutral gas temperature in
K, Ma is the gas mass in AMU, and A is the open area in m2. The total flow rate into the thruster
is then
Qtotal = Qinjected + Qingested
(2.7-8)

Chapter 3
Basic Plasma Physics
3.1
Introduction
Electric propulsion (EP) achieves high-specific impulse by the acceleration of charged particles to
high velocity. The charged particles are produced by ionization of a propellant gas, which creates
both ions and electrons and forms what is called a plasma. Plasma is then a collection of the various
charged particles that are free to move in response to fields they generate or fields that are applied to
the collection, and on the average is almost electrically neutral. This means that the ion and elec-
tron densities are nearly equal, ni ≈ne, a condition commonly termed “quasi-neutrality”. This con-
dition exists throughout the volume of the ionized gas except close to the boundaries, and the
assumption of quasi-neutrality is valid whenever the spatial scale length of the plasma is much lar-
ger than the characteristic length over which charges or boundaries are electrostatically shielded,
called the Debye length. The ions and electrons have distributions in energy usually characterized
by a temperature Ti for ions and Te for electrons, which are not necessarily or usually the same. In
addition, different ion and electron species can exist in the plasma with different temperatures or
different distributions in energy.
Plasmas in EP devices, even in individual parts of a thruster, can span orders of magnitude in
plasma density, temperature, and ionization fraction. Therefore, models used to describe the
plasma behavior and characteristics in the thrusters must be formed with assumptions that are
valid in the regime being studied. Many of the plasma conditions and behaviors in thrusters can
be modeled by fluid equations, and kinetic effects are only important in specific instances.
There are several textbooks that provide very comprehensive introductions to plasma physics
[1–3] and the generation of ion beams [4]. This chapter is intended to provide the basic plasma
physics necessary to understand the operation of electric thrusters. The units used throughout
the book are based on the International System (SI). However, by convention we will occasionally
revert to other metric units (such as A/cm2, mg/s, etc.) commonly used in the literature describing
these devices.

The electric and magnetic fields that exist in EP plasmas obey Maxwell’s Equations formulated in a
vacuum that contains charges and currents. Maxwell’s equations for these conditions are:

where ρ is the charge density in the plasma, J is the current density in the plasma, and εo and μο are
the permittivity and permeability of free space, respectively. Note that ρ and J comprise all the
charges and currents for all the particle species that are present in the plasma, including multiply-
charged ions. The charge density is then

where qs is the charge state of species s, Z is the charge state, ni is the ion number density, and ne is
the electron number density. Likewise, the current density is

qsnsυs = e Zniυi −neυe
(3.2-6)
where υs is the velocity of the charge species, υi is the ion velocity, and υe is the electron velocity. For
static magnetic fields (∂B/∂t = 0), the electric field can be expressed as the gradient of the electric
potential
E = −∇ϕ,
(3.2-7)
where the negative sign comes from the convention that the electric field always points in the direc-
tion of ion motion.

Single Particle Motions
The equation of motion for a charged particle with a velocity v in a magnetic field B is given by the
Lorentz force equation:
F = m dv
dt = q E + v × B
(3.3-1)
Particle motion in a magnetic field in the z direction for the case of negligible electric field is
found by evaluating Eq. 3.3-1:

∂t = −qBυx
(3.3-2)

These equations describe a simple harmonic oscillator at the cyclotron frequency:

(3.3-4)
For electrons, this is called the electron cyclotron frequency.
The size of the particle orbit for finite particle energies can be found from the solution to the
particle motion equations in the axial magnetic field. In this case, the solution to Eq. 3.3-3 is
υx,y = υ⊥eiωct
(3.3-5)

(3.3-7)
Integrating this equation gives

(3.3-8)
Taking the real part of Eq. 3.3-8 gives
y −yo = υ⊥
ωc
cos ωct = rL cos ωct,
(3.3-9)
where rL = υ⊥/ωc is defined as the Larmor radius. A similar analysis of the displacement in the x
direction gives the same Larmor radius 90 out of phase with the y-direction displacement, which
with Eq. 3.3-9 describes the particle motion as a circular orbit
around the field line at xo and yo with a radius given by rL.
The Larmor radius arises from very simple physics. Consider
a charged particle of mass m in a uniform magnetic field with a
velocity in one direction, as illustrated in Fig. 3-1. The charge
will feel a Lorentz force
F = qv⊥× B
(3.3-10)
Since the charged particle will move under this force in circular
orbits in the v⊥× B direction, it feels a corresponding
centripetal force such that
Fc = qv⊥× B = mυ2

(3.3-13)
using 1
2 mv⊥= eV⊥for the singly-charged particle energy in the direction perpendicular to the mag-
netic field. The direction of particle gyration is always such that the induced magnetic field is oppo-
site in direction to the applied field, which tends to reduce the applied field, an effect called
diamagnetism. Any particle motion along the magnetic field is not affected by the field, but
causes the particle motion to form a helix along the magnetic field direction with a radius given
by the Larmor radius and a pitch given by the ratio of the perpendicular to parallel velocities.
Next consider the situation in Fig. 3-1, but with the addition of a finite electric field perpendicular
to B. In this case, E is in some direction in the plane of the page. The equation of motion for the
charged particle is given by Eq. 3.3-1. Considering the drift to be steady-state, the time derivative is
equal to zero, and Eq. 3.3-1 becomes
E = −v × B
(3.3-14)
Taking the cross product of both sides with B gives
E × B = −v × B × B = vB2 −B B v
(3.3-15)
The dot product is in the direction perpendicular to B, so the last term in Eq. 3.3-15 is equal to zero.
Solving for the transverse velocity of the particle gives
v = E × B
B2
vE,
(3.3-16)
which is the “E cross B” drift velocity. In this case, the drift is in the direction perpendicular to both
E and B, and arises from the cycloidal electron motion in the magnetic field being accelerated in the
direction of –E and decelerated in the direction of E. This elongates the orbit on one half cycle and
shrinks the orbit on the opposite half cycle, which causes the net motion of the particle in the E × B
direction. The units of the E × B velocity are
υE = E V m
B tesla m s
(3.3-17)
Finally, consider the situation of a particle gyrating in a magnetic field that is changing in magni-
tude along the magnetic field direction z. This is commonly found in EP thrusters relatively close to
permanent magnets or electromagnetic pole-pieces that produce fields used to confine the elec-
trons. Since the divergence of B is zero (Eq. 3.2-3), the magnetic field in cylindrical coordinates
is described by
1
r
∂
∂r rBr + ∂Bz
∂z = 0
(3.3-18)
Assuming that the axial component of the field does not vary significantly with r and integrating
yields the radial component of the magnetic field with respect to r:
Br ≈−r

∂Bz
∂z
(3.3-19)
36
3 Basic Plasma Physics

The Lorentz force on a charged particle has a component along z given by
Fz ≈−qυϕBr,
(3.3-20)
where the azimuthal particle velocity averaged over a Larmor-radius (r = rL) gyration is υϕ = −υ⊥.
The average force on the particle is then
Fz ≈−1

(3.3-21)
The magnetic moment of the gyrating particle is defined as
μ = 1

⊥
B
(3.3-22)
As the particle moves along the magnetic field lines into a stronger magnitude field regions, the
parallel energy of the particle is converted into rotational energy and its Larmor radius increases.
However, its magnetic moment remains invariant because the magnetic field does no work and the
total kinetic energy of the particle is conserved. For a sufficiently large increase in the magnetic
field, a situation can arise where the parallel velocity of the particle goes to zero and the Lorentz
force reflects the particle from a “magnetic mirror”. By conservation of energy, particles will be
reflected from the magnetic mirror if their parallel velocity is less than
υ < υ⊥
Rm −1,
(3.3-23)
where υ|| is the parallel velocity and Rm is the mirror ratio given by Bmax/Bmin. This effect is used to
provide confinement of energetic electrons in ion thruster discharge chambers.
There are a number of other particle drifts and motions possible that depend on gradients in the
magnetic and electric fields, and also on time dependent or oscillating electric or magnetic fields.
These are described in detail in plasma physics texts such as Chen [1], and although they certainly
might occur in the EP devices considered here, they are typically not of critical importance to the
thruster performance or behavior.
3.4
Particle Energies and Velocities
In electric thrusters, the charge particles may undergo a large number of collisions with each
other, and in some cases with the other species (ions, electrons, and/or neutrals) in the plasma.
It is therefore impractical to analyze the motion of each particle to obtain a macroscopic picture
of the plasma processes that is useful for assessing the performance and life of these devices. For-
tunately, in most cases it is not necessary to track individual particles to understand the plasma
dynamics. The effect of collisions is to develop a distribution of the velocities for each species.
On the average, and in the absence of other forces, each particle will then move with a speed that
is solely a function of the macroscopic temperature and mass of that species. The charged particles
in the thruster, therefore, can usually be described by different velocity distribution functions and
the random motions calculated by taking the moments of those distributions.
Most of the charged particles in electric thrusters have a Maxwellian velocity distribution, which
is the most probable distribution of velocities for a group of particles in thermal equilibrium. In one
dimension, the Maxwellian velocity distribution function is:
f υ =
m
2πkT
1 2
exp −mυ2
2kT
,
(3.4-1)
3.4 Particle Energies and Velocities

where m is the mass of the particle, k is Boltzmann constant, and the width of the distribution is
characterized by the temperature T. The average kinetic energy of a particle in the Maxwellian
distribution in one dimension is
Eave =

(3.4-2)
By inserting in Eq. 3.4-1 and integrating by parts, the average energy per particle in each dimen-

f u, υ, w =

exp −m
2kT u2 + υ2 + w2
,
(3.4-4)
where u, υ and w represent the velocity components in the three coordinate axes. The average

integration to give
Eave = 3

the average speed per particle is
υ =

πm
1 2
(3.4-8)
The flux of particles in one dimension (say in the z direction) for a Maxwellian distribution of par-
ticle velocities is given by n<υz>. In this case, the average over the particle velocities is taken in the
positive υz direction because the flux is considered in only one direction. The particle flux (in one
direction) is then
Γz =
nυz f υ d3υ,
(3.4-9)
which can be evaluated by integrating the velocities in spherical coordinates with the velocity vol-
ume element given by
d3υ = υ2dυ dΩ = υ2dυ sinθ dθ dϕ,
(3.4-10)
38

where the dΩ represents the element of the solid angle. If the incident velocity has a cosine distri-

(3.4-12)
Since the plasma electrons are very mobile and tend to make a large number of Coulomb collisions
with each other, they can usually be characterized by a Maxwellian temperature Te and have aver-
age energies and speeds well described by the equations derived in this section. The random elec-
tron flux inside the plasma is also well described by Eq. 3.4-12 if the electron temperature and
density are known. The electrons tend to be relatively hot (compared to the ions and atoms) in elec-
tric thrusters because they are typically injected into the plasma or heated by external mechanisms
to provide sufficient energy to produce ionization. In the presence of electric and magnetic fields in
the plasma and at the boundaries, the electron motion will no longer be purely random, and the flux
described by Eq. 3.4-12 must be modified as described below.
The ions in thrusters, on the other hand, are usually relatively cold in temperature (they may
have high directed velocities after being accelerated, but they usually have relatively low random
velocities and temperatures). This occurs because the ions are not well confined in the plasma gen-
erators for the reason that they must be extracted to form the thrust beam, and so leave the plasma
after perhaps only a single pass. The ions are also not heated efficiently by the various mechanisms
used to ionize the gas. Therefore, the plasmas in electric thrusters are usually characterized as
having relatively cold ions and Maxwellian electrons with a high electron to ion temperature ratio
(Te/Ti ≈10). As a result, the velocity of the ions in the plasma and the fluxes to the boundaries tend
to be determined by the electric fields generated inside the plasma to conserve charge, and are dif-
ferent than the expressions derived here for the electron velocity and fluxes. This effect will be
described in more detail in Section 3.6.
3.5
Plasma as a Fluid
The behavior of most of the plasma effects in electric thrusters can be described by simplified
models in which the plasma is treated as a fluid of neutral particles and electrical charges with
Maxwellian distribution functions, and only the interactions and motion of the fluid elements must
be considered. Kinetic effects that consider the actual velocity distribution of each species are
important in some instances, but will not be addressed here.
3.5.1
Momentum Conservation
In constructing a fluid approach to plasmas, there are three dominant forces on the charged par-
ticles in the plasma that transfer momentum that are considered here. First, charged particles react
to electric and magnetic fields via the Lorentz force, which was given by Eq. 3.3-1:
FL = m dv
dt = q E + v × B
(3.5-1)
3.5 Plasma as a Fluid
39

Next, there is a pressure gradient force
Fp = −∇p
n
= −∇nkT
n
,
(3.5-2)
where the pressure is given by P = nkT and should be written more rigorously as a stress tensor
since it can, in general, be anisotropic. For plasmas with temperatures that are generally spatially
constant, the force due to the pressure gradient is usually written simply as
Fp = −kT ∇n
n
(3.5-3)
Finally, collisions transfer momentum between the different charged particles, and also between
the charged particles and the neutral gas. The force due to collisions is
Fc = −m
a, b
νab va −vb
(3.5-4)
where νab is the collision frequency between species a and b.
Using these three force terms, the fluid momentum equation for each species is
mn dv
dt = mn ∂v
∂t + v ∇v
= qn E + v × B −∇p −mnν v −vo
(3.5-5)
where the convective derivative has been written explicitly and the collision term must be summed
over all collisions.
Utilizing conservation of momentum, it is possible to evaluate how the electron fluid behaves in
the plasma. For example, in one dimension and in the absence of magnetic fields and collisions with
other species, the fluid equation of motion for electrons can be written as
mne
∂υz
∂t + υ ∇υz
= qneEz −∂p
∂z ,
(3.5-6)
where υz is the electron velocity in the z-direction and p represents the electron pressure term.
Neglecting the convective derivative, assuming that the velocity is spatially uniform, and using
Eq. 3.5-3 gives
m ∂υz
∂t = −eEz −kTe
ne
∂ne
∂z
(3.5-7)
Assuming that the electrons have essentially no inertia (their mass is small and so they react infi-
nitely fast to changes in potential), the left-hand side of Eq. 3.5-7 goes to zero and the net current in
the system is also zero. Considering only electrons at a temperature Te, and using Eq. 3.2-7 for the
electric field, gives
qEz = e ∂ϕ
∂z = kTe
ne
∂ne
∂z
(3.5-8)
Integrating this equation and solving for the electron density produces the “Boltzmann relation-
ship” for electrons:
ne = ne 0 e eϕ kTe
(3.5-9)
where ϕ is the potential relative to the potential ϕo at the location of ne(0).
40
3 Basic Plasma Physics

Equation 3.5-9 is sometimes written as
ne = ne 0 e
ϕ z −ϕo
TeV
(3.5-10)
where TeV is the electron temperature in electron-volts and the exponent specifically shows the ref-
erence potential. This relationship simply states that the electrons will respond to electrostatic fields
(potential changes) by varying their density to preserve the pressure in the system. This relationship
is generally valid for motion along a magnetic field and tends to hold for motion across magnetic
fields if the field is weak and the electron collisions are frequent.
3.5.2
Particle Conservation
Conservation of particles and/or charges in the plasma is described by the continuity equation:
∂n
∂t + ∇nv = ns,
(3.5-11)
where ns represents the time dependent source or sink term for the species being considered. Con-
tinuity equations are sometimes called mass-conservation equations because they account for the
sources and sinks of particles into and out of the plasma.
Utilizing continuity equations coupled with momentum conservation and with Maxwell’s equa-
tions, it is possible to calculate the response rate and wave-like behavior of plasmas. For example,
the rate at which a plasma responds to changes in potential is related to the plasma frequency of the
electrons. Assume that there is no magnetic field in the plasma or that the electron motion is along
the magnetic field in the z-direction. To simplify this derivation, also assume that the ions are fixed
uniformly in space on the time scales of interest here due to their large mass, and there is no thermal
motion of the particles (T = 0). Since the ions are fixed in this case, only the electron equation of
motion is of interest:
mne
∂υz
∂t + υ ∇υz
= −eneEz,
(3.5-12)
and the electron equation of continuity is
∂ne
∂t + ∇
nev = 0
(3.5-13)
The relationship between the electric field and the charge densities is given by Eq. 3.2-1, which can
be written using Eq. 3.2-5 as
∇E = ρ
εo
= e
εo
ni −ne ,
(3.5-14)
The wave-like behavior of this system is analyzed by linearizing using
E = Eo + E1
(3.5-15)
v = vo + υ1
(3.5-16)
n = no + n1
(3.5-17)
3.5 Plasma as a Fluid
41

where Eo, vo, and no are the equilibrium values of the electric field, electron velocity and electron
density, and E1, υ1, and n1 are the perturbed values of these quantities. Since quasi-neutral
plasma has been assumed, Eo = 0, and the assumption of a uniform plasma with no temperature
means that Δno = vo = 0. Likewise, the time derivatives of these equilibrium quantities are zero.
Linearizing Eq. 3.5-14 gives
∇E1 = −e
εo
n1
(3.5-18)
Substituting Eqs. 3.5-15, 3.5-16, and 3.5-17 in Eq. 3.5-12 results in
dυ1
dt = −e
m E1z,
(3.5-19)
where the linearized convective derivative has been neglected. Linearizing the continuity
Eq. 3.5-13 gives
dn1
dt = −no∇υ1z,
(3.5-20)
where the quadratic terms, such as n1υ1, etc., have been neglected as small. In the linear regime, the
oscillating quantities will behave sinusoidally:
E1 = E1ei kz −ωt z
(3.5-21)
υ1 = υ1ei kz −ωt z
(3.5-22)
n1 = n1ei kz −ωt
(3.5-23)
This means that the time derivates in the momentum and continuity equations can be replaced by
-iω, and the gradient in Eq. 3.5-18 can be replaced by ik in the z direction. Combining Eqs. 3.5-18,
3.5-19, and 3.5-20, using the time and spatial derivatives of the oscillating quantities, and solving for
the frequency of the oscillation gives
ωp =
nee2
εom
1 2
,
(3.5-24)
where ωp is the electron plasma frequency. A useful numerical formula for the electron plasma
frequency is
f p = ωp
2π ≈9
ne,
(3.5-25)
where the plasma density is in m−3. This frequency is one of the fundamental parameters of a
plasma, and the inverse of this value is approximately the minimum time required for the plasma
to react to changes in its boundaries or in the applied potentials. For example, if the plasma density
is 1018 m−3, the electron plasma frequency is 9 GHz, and the electron plasma will respond to per-
turbations in less than a nanosecond.
In a similar manner, if the ion temperature is assumed to be negligible and the gross response of
the plasma is dominated by ion motions, the ion plasma frequency can be found to be
Ωp =
nee2
εoM
1 2
(3.5-26)
42
3 Basic Plasma Physics

This equation provides the approximate time scale in which ions move in the plasma. For our pre-
vious example for a 1018 m−3 plasma density composed of xenon ions, the ion plasma frequency is
about 18 MHz and the ions will respond to first order in a fraction of a microsecond. However, the
ions have inertia and respond at the ion acoustic velocity given by
υa =
γikTi + kTe
M
,
(3.5-27)
where γi is the ratio of ion specific heats and is equal to one for isothermal ions. In the normal case
for ion and Hall thrusters where Te >> Ti, the ion acoustic velocity is simply
υa =
kTe
M
(3.5-28)
It should be noted that if finite-temperature electrons and ions had been included in the derivations
above, the electron-plasma and ion-plasma oscillations would have produced waves that propagate
with finite wavelengths in the plasma. Electron plasma waves and ion plasma waves (sometimes
called ion acoustic waves) occur in most electric thruster plasmas with varying amplitudes and
effects on the plasma behavior. The dispersion relationships for these waves, which describe the
relationship between the frequency and the wavelength of the wave, are derived in detail in plasma
textbooks such as Chen [1] and will not be re-derived here.
3.5.3

(3.5-29)
For simplicity, Eq. 3.5-29 neglects viscous heating of the species. The divergence terms on the
left-hand side represent the total energy flux, which includes the work done by the pressure,
the macroscopic energy flux, and the transport of heat by conduction θs = −κs∇Ts. The thermal
conductivity of the species is denoted by κs, which is given in SI units [5] by
κs = 3 2 τene2TeV
m
,
(3.5-30)
where TeV in this equation is in electron volts (eV). The right-hand side of Eq. 3.5-29 accounts for
the work done by other forces as well for the generation/loss of heat as a result of collisions with
other particles. The term Rs represents the mean change in the momentum of particles “s” as a
result of collisions with all other particles:
Rs

Rsn = −

(3.5-31)
The heat-exchange terms are Qs, which is the heat generated/lost in the particles of species “s” as a
result of elastic collisions with all other species, and Ψs, the energy loss by species “s” as a result of
inelastic collision processes such as ionization and excitation.

It is often useful to eliminate the kinetic energy from Eq. 3.5-29 to obtain a more applicable form

to ionization, with Ui (in volts) representing the first ionization potential of the atom. In
Eq. 3.5-39, the meυe
2/2 correction term has been neglected because usually in electric thrusters
eUi >> meυe
2/2. If multiple ionization and/or excitation losses are significant, the inelastic terms
in Eq. 3.5-39 must be augmented accordingly.
In electric thrusters it is common to assume a single temperature or distribution of temperatures
for the heavy species without directly solving the energy equation(s). In some cases, however, such
as in the plume of a hollow cathode for example, the ratio of Te/Ti is important for determining the
extent of Landau damping on possible electrostatic instabilities. The heavy species temperature is
also important for determining the total pressure inside the cathode. Thus, separate energy equa-
tions must be solved directly. Assuming that the heavy species are slow-moving and the inelastic
loss terms are negligible, Eq. 3.5-35 for ions takes the form

(3.5-40)
where the subscript “in” represents ion-neutral collisions.
Finally, the total heat generated in partially ionized plasmas as a result of the (elastic) friction
between the various species is given by

Since Rsa = −Ras it is possible to write this as

(3.5-42)
The energy conservation equation(s) can be used with the momentum and continuity equations to
provide a closed set of equations for analysis of plasma dynamics within the fluid approximations.

Diffusion in Partially Ionized Plasma
Diffusion is often very important in the particle transport in electric thruster plasmas. The presence
of pressure gradients and collisions between different species of charged particles and between the
charged particles and the neutrals produces diffusion of the plasma from high density regions to low
density regions, both along and across magnetic field lines.
To evaluate diffusion driven particle motion in electric thruster plasmas, the equation of motion
for any species can be written as
mn dv
dt = qn E + v × B −∇p −mnν v −vo ,
(3.6-1)
where the terms in this equation have been previously defined and ν is the collision frequency
between any two species in the plasma. To apply and solve this equation, it is first necessary to
understand the collisional processes between the different species in the plasma that determines
the applicable collision frequency.
3.6 Diffusion in Partially Ionized Plasma

3.6.1
Collisions
Charged particles in a plasma interact with each other primarily by Coulomb collisions, and also
can collide with neutral atoms present in the plasma. These collisions are very important when
describing diffusion, mobility, and resistivity in the plasma.
When a charged particle collides with a neutral atom, it can undergo an elastic or an inelastic
collision. The probability that such a collision will occur can be expressed in terms of an effective
cross-sectional area. Consider a thin slice of neutral gas with an area A and a thickness dx contain-
ing essentially stationary neutral gas atoms with a density na. Assume that the atoms are simple
spheres of cross-sectional area σ. The number of atoms in the slice is given by naAdx. The fraction
of the slice area that is occupied by the spheres is
naAσdx
A
= naσdx
(3.6-2)
If the incident flux of particles is Γo, then the flux that emerges without making a collision after
passing through the slice is
Γ x = Γo 1 −naσdx
(3.6-3)
The change in the flux as the particles pass through the slice is
dΓ
dx = −Γnaσ
(3.6-4)
The solution to Eq. 3.6-4 is
Γ = Γoe −naσx = Γoe
−xλ ,
(3.6-5)
where λ is defined as the mean free path for collisions and describes the distance in which the par-
ticle flux would decrease to 1/e of its initial value. The mean free path is given by
λ =
1
naσ ,
(3.6-6)
which represents the mean distance that a relatively fast moving particle, such as an electron or ion,
will travel in a stationary density of neutral particles.
The mean time between collisions for this case is given by the mean free path divided by the
charged particle velocity:
τ =
1
naσυ
(3.6-7)
Averaging over all of the Maxwellian velocities of the charged particles, the collision frequency
is then
ν = 1
τ = naσυ
(3.6-8)
In the event that a relatively slowly moving particle, such as a neutral atom, is incident on a density
of fast moving electrons, the mean free path for the neutral particle to experience a collision is
given by
λ =
υn
ne συe
,
(3.6-9)
46
3 Basic Plasma Physics

where υn is the neutral particle velocity and the reaction rate coefficient in the denominator is aver-
aged over all the relevant collision cross sections. Eq. 3.6-9 can be used to describe the distance that
a neutral gas atom travels in a plasma before ionization occurs, which is sometimes called the pen-
etration distance.
Other collisions are also very important in electric thrusters. The presence of inelastic collisions
between electrons and neutrals can result in either ionization or excitation of the neutral particle.
The ion production rate per unit volume is given by
dni
dt = nane σiυe ,
(3.6-10)
where σi is the ionization cross section, υe is the electron velocity, and the term in the brackets is the
reaction rate coefficient, which is the ionization cross section averaged over the electron velocity
distribution function.
Likewise, the production rate per unit volume of excited neutrals, n∗, is
dn∗
dt
=
j
nane σ∗υe j
(3.6-11)
where σ∗is the excitation cross section and the reaction rate coefficient is averaged over the electron
distribution function and summed over all possible excited states j. A listing of the ionization and
excitation cross sections for xenon and krypton are given in Appendix D, and the reaction rate
coefficients for ionization and excitation averaged over a Maxwellian electron distribution are
given in Appendix E.
Charge exchange [2, 6] in electric thrusters usually describes the resonant charge transfer
between like atoms and ions in which essentially no kinetic energy is exchanged during the colli-
sion. Because this is a resonant process, it can occur at large distances and the charge exchange
(CEX) cross section is very large [2]. For example, the charge exchange cross section for xenon
is about 10−18 m2[7], which is significantly larger than the ionization and excitation cross sections
for this atom. Since the ions in the thruster are often energetic due to acceleration by the electric
fields in the plasma or acceleration in ion thruster grid structures, charge exchange results in the
production of energetic neutrals and relatively cold ions. Charge exchange collisions are often a
dominant factor in the heating of cathode structures, the mobility and diffusion of ions in the
thruster plasma, and the erosion of grid structures and thruster surfaces.
While the details of classical collision physics are interesting, they are well described in several
other textbooks [1, 2, 5] and are not critically important to understanding electric thrusters.
However, the various collision frequencies and cross sections are of interest for use in modeling
the thruster discharge and performance.
The frequency of collisions between electron and neutrals is sometimes written [8] as
νen = σen Te na
8kTe
πm ,
(3.6-12)
where the effective electron-neutral scattering cross section σ(Te) for xenon can be found
from a numerical fit to the electron-neutral scattering cross section averaged over a Maxwellian
electron distribution [8]:
σen Te = 6 6 × 10 −19

where Tev is in electron volts. The electron-ion collision frequency for Coulomb collisions [1] is
given in SI units by
νei = 2 9 × 10 −12 ZnelnΛ
T3 2

(3.6-14)
where lnΛ is the Coulomb logarithm given in a familiar form [5] by
lnΛ = 23 −1

(3.6-15)
The electron–electron collision frequency [1] is given by
νee = 5 × 10 −12 nelnΛ
T3 2
eV
,
(3.6-16)
While the values of the electron-ion and the electron–electron collision frequencies in Eqs. 3.6-14
and 3.6-16 are clearly comparable, the electron–electron thermalization time is much shorter than
the electron-ion thermalization time due to the large mass difference between the electrons and
ions reducing the energy transferred in each collision. This is a major reason that electrons ther-
malize rapidly into a population with Maxwellian distribution, but do not thermalize rapidly with
the ions.
In addition, the ion-ion collision frequency [1] is given by
νii = Z4 m
M
1 2 Te
Ti
3 2
νee,
(3.6-17)
where Z is the ion charge number.
Collisions between like particles and between separate species tend to equilibrate the energy and
distribution functions of the particles. This effect was analyzed in detail by Spitzer [9] in his classic
book. In electric thrusters, there are several equilibration time constants of interest. First, the char-
acteristic collision times between the different charged particles is just one over the average colli-
sion frequencies given above. Second, equilibration times between the species and between
different populations of the same species were calculated by Spitzer. The time for a monoenergetic
electron (sometimes called a primary electron) to equilibrate with the Maxwellian population of the
plasma electrons is called the slowing time τs. Finally, the time for one Maxwellian population to
equilibrate with another Maxwellian population is called the equilibration time τeq. Expressions for
these equilibration times, and a comparison of the rates of equilibration by these two effects, are
found in Appendix F.
Collisions of electrons with other species in the plasma lead to resistivity and provide a mechan-
ism for heating. This mechanism is often called ohmic heating or joule heating. In steady state and
neglecting electron inertia, the electron momentum equation, taking into account electron-ion col-
lisions and electron-neutral collisions, is
0 = −en E + ve × B −∇pe −mn νei ve −vi + νen ve −vn
(3.6-18)
The electron velocity is very large with respect to the neutral velocity, and Eq. 3.6-18 can be
written as
48
3 Basic Plasma Physics

0 = −en E + ∇pe
en
−enve × B −mn νei + υen ve + mnνeivi
(3.6-19)
Since charged particle current density is given by J = qnv, Eq. 3.6-19 can be written as
ηJe = E + ∇p −Je × B
en
−ηeiJi,
(3.6-20)
where Je is the electron current density, Ji is the ion current density and ηei is the plasma resistivity.
Eq. 3.6-20 is commonly known as Ohm’s Law for partially ionized plasmas and is a variant of the
well-known generalized Ohm’s Law, which usually expressed in terms of the total current density
J = en(vi−ve) and the ion fluid velocity vi. If there are no collisions or net current in the plasma, this
equation reduces to Eq. 3.5-7 which was used to derive the Boltzmann relationship for plasma
electrons.
From Eq. 3.6-20, the total resistivity of a partiallyionized plasma is given by
η = m νei + νen
e2n
=
1
εoτeω2
p
,
(3.6-21)
where the total collision time for electrons, accounting for both electron-ion and electron-neutral
collisions, is given by
τe =
1
νei + νen
(3.6-22)
By neglecting the electron-neutral collision terms in Eq. 3.6-19, the well-known expression [1, 9] for
the resistivity of a fully-ionized plasma is recovered:
ηei = mνei
e2n =
1
εoτeiω2
p
(3.6-23)
In electric thrusters, the ion current in the plasma is typically much smaller than the electron cur-
rent due to the large mass ratio, so the ion current term in Ohm’s Law (Eq. 3.6-20) is sometimes
neglected.
3.6.2
Diffusion and Mobility Without a Magnetic Field
The simplest case of diffusion in a plasma is found by neglecting the magnetic field and writing the
equation of motion for any species as
mn dv
dt = qnE −∇p −mnν v −vo ,
(3.6-24)
where m is the species mass and the collision frequency is taken to be a constant. Assume that the
velocity of the particle species of interest is large compared to the slow species (v >> v0), the
plasma is isothermal (∇p = kT ∇n), and the diffusion is steady state and occurring with a
sufficiently high velocity that the convective derivative can be neglected. Eq. 3.6-24 can then be
solved for the particle velocity:
v =
q
mν E −kT
mν
∇n
n
(3.6-25)
3.6 Diffusion in Partially Ionized Plasma
49

The coefficients of the electric field and the density gradient terms in Eq. 3.6-25 are called the
mobility:
μ =
q
mν m2
V s
(3.6-26)
and the diffusion coefficient:
D = kT
mν m2 s
(3.6-27)
These terms are related by what is called the Einstein relation:
μ = q D
kT
(3.6-28)
3.6.2.1
Fick’s Law and the Diffusion Equation
The flux of diffusing particles in the simple case of Eq. 3.6-25 is
Γ = nv = μnE −D∇n
(3.6-29)
A special case of this is called Fick’s law, in which the flux of particles for either the electric field or
the mobility term being zero is given by
Γ = −D∇n
(3.6-30)
The continuity equation (Eq. 3.5-11) without sink or source terms can be written as
∂n
∂t + ∇Γ = 0,
(3.6-31)
where Γ represents the flux of any species of interest. If the diffusion coefficient D is constant
throughout the plasma, substituting Eq. 3.6-30 into Eq. 3.6-31 gives the well-known diffusion equa-
tion for a single species:
∂n
∂t −D∇2n = 0
(3.6-32)
The solution to this equation can be obtained by separation of variables. The simplest example
of this is for slab geometry of finite width, where the plasma density can be expressed as having
separable spatial and temporal dependencies:
n x, t = X x T t
(3.6-33)
Substituting this into Eq. 3.6-32 gives
X dT
dt = DT d2X
dx2
(3.6-34)
Separating the terms gives
1
T
dT
dt = D 1
X
d2X
dx2 = α,
(3.6-35)
where each side of the equation is independent of the other side and can therefore be set equal to a
constant α. The time dependent function is then
50
3 Basic Plasma Physics

dT
dt = −T
τ ,
(3.6-36)
where the constant α will be written as −1/τ. The solution to Eq. 3.6-36 is
T = Toe −t τ
(3.6-37)
Since there is no ionization source term in Eq. 3.6-32, the plasma density decays exponentially with
time from the initial state due to the diffusion.
The right-hand side of Eq. 3.6-35 has the spatial dependence of the diffusion and can be written as
d2X
dx2 = −X
Dτ ,
(3.6-38)
where again the constant α will be written as −1/τ. This equation has a solution of the form
X = A cos X
L + B sin X
L ,
(3.6-39)
where A and B are constants and L is the diffusion length given by (Dτ)1/2. If it is assumed that
X is zero at the boundaries at ±d/2, then the lowest order solution is symmetric (B = 0) with
the diffusion length equal to π. The solution to Eq. 3.6-38 is then
X = cos πx
d
(3.6-40)
The lowest-order complete solution to the diffusion equation for the plasma density is then the
product of Eqs. 3.6-37 and 3.6-40:
n = noe −t τ cos πx
d
(3.6-41)
Of course, higher order odd solutions are possible for given initial conditions, but the higher order
modes decay faster and the lowest order mode typically dominates after a sufficient time. The
plasma density decays with time from the initial value no, but the boundary condition (zero plasma
density at the wall) maintains the plasma shape described by the cosine function in Eq. 3.6-41.
Although slabgeometry was chosen for this illustrative example due to its simplicity, situations in
which slab geometries are useful in modeling electric thrusters are rare. However, solutions to the
diffusion equation in other coordinates more typically found in these thrusters are obtained in a
similar manner. For example, in cylindrical geometries found in many hollow cathodes and in
ion thruster discharge chambers, the solution to the cylindrical differential equation follows Bessel
functions radially and still decays exponentially in time if source terms are not considered.
Solutions to the diffusion equation with source or sink terms on the right-hand side are more
complicated to solve. This can be seen in writing the diffusion equation as
∂n
∂t −D∇2n = n,
(3.6-42)
where the source term is described by an ionization rate equation per unit volume given by
n = nan σiυe ≈nanσi Te υ,
(3.6-43)
and where υ is the average particle speed found in Eq. 3.4-8, and σi(Te) is the impact ionization
cross-section averaged over a Maxwellian distribution of electrons at a temperature Te.
Equations for the xenon and krypton ionization reaction rate coefficients averaged over a
Maxwellian distribution are found in Appendix E.
3.6 Diffusion in Partially Ionized Plasma
51

A separation of variables solution can still be obtained for this case, but the time-dependent
behavior is no longer purely exponential as was found in Eq. 3.6-37. In this situation, the plasma
density will increase or decay to an equilibrium value depending on the magnitude of the source
and sink terms.
To find the steady state solution to the cylindrical diffusion equation, the time derivative in
Eq. 3.6-42 is set equal to zero. Writing the diffusion equation in cylindrical coordinates and assum-
ing uniform radial electron temperatures and neutral densities, Eq. 3.6-42 becomes
∂2n
∂r2 + 1
r
∂n
∂r + ∂2n
∂z2 + C2n = 0,
(3.6-44)
where the constant is given by
C2 = naσi Te υ
D
(3.6-45)
This equation can be solved analytically by separation of variables of the form
n = n 0, 0 f r g z
(3.6-46)
Using Eq. 3.6-46, the diffusion equation becomes
1
f
∂2f
∂r2 + 1
rf
∂f
∂r + C2 + α2 = −1
g
∂2g
∂z2 + α2 = 0
(3.6-47)
The solution to the radial component of Eq. 3.6-47 is the sum of the zero-order Bessel functions of
the first and second kind, which is written in a general form as
f r = A1Jo αr + A2Y o αr
(3.6-48)
The Bessel function of the second kind Yo becomes infinite as (αr) goes to zero, and because the
density must always be finite, the constant A2 must equal zero. Therefore, the solution for
Eq. 3.6-47 is the product of the zero order Bessel function of the first kind times an exponential
term in the axial direction:
n r, z = n 0, 0 Jo
C2 + α2r e −αz
(3.6-49)
Assuming that the ion density goes to zero at the wall,
C2 + α2 = λ01
r ,
(3.6-50)
where λ01is the first zero of the zero-order Bessel function and r is now the internal radius of the
cylinder being considered. Setting α = 0, this eigenvalue results in an equation that gives a direct
relationship between the electron temperature, the radius of the plasma cylinder, and the diffu-
sion rate:
r
λ01

naσi Te
8kTe
πm −D = 0
(3.6-51)
The physical meaning of Eq. 3.6-51 is that particle balance in bounded plasma discharges domi-
nated by radial diffusion determines the plasma electron temperature. This occurs because the gen-
eration rate of ions, which is determined by the electron temperature from Eq. 3.6-43, must equal
the ion loss rate, which is determined by the diffusion rate to the walls, to satisfy the boundary
condition. Therefore, the solution to the steady-state cylindrical diffusion equation specifies both
52
3 Basic Plasma Physics

the radial plasma profile and the maximum electron temperature once the dependence of the dif-
fusion coefficient is specified. This result is very useful in modeling the plasma discharges in hollow
cathodes and in various types of electric thrusters.
3.6.2.2
Ambipolar Diffusion Without a Magnetic Field
In many circumstances in thrusters, the flux of ions and electrons from a given region or the plasma
as a whole are equal. For example, in the case of microwave ion thrusters, the ions and electrons are
created in pairs during ionization by the plasma electrons heated by the microwaves, so simple
charge conservation states that the net flux of both ions and electrons out of the plasma must
be the same. The plasma will then establish the required electric fields in the system to slow the
more mobile electrons such that the electron escape rate is the same as the slower ions loss rate.
This finite electric field affects the diffusion rate for both species.
Since the expression for the flux in Eq. 3.6-29 was derived for any species of particles, a diffusion
coefficient for ions (Di) and electrons (De) can be designated (because D in Eq. 3.6-27 contains the
particle mass) and the fluxes equated to obtain
μinE −Di∇n = −μenE −De∇n,
(3.6-52)
where quasi-neutrality (ni ≈ne) in the plasma has been assumed. Solving for the electric field gives
E = Di −De
μi + μe
∇n
n
(3.6-53)
Substituting E into the Eq. 3.6-29 for the ion flux,
Γ = −μiDe + μeDi
μi + μe
∇n = −Da∇n,
(3.6-54)
where Da is the ambipolar diffusion coefficient given by
Da = μiDe + μeDi
μi + μe
(3.6-55)
Equation 3.6-54 was expressed in the form of Fick’s Law, but with a new diffusion coefficient
reflecting the impact of ambipolar flow on the particle mobilities. Substituting Eq. 3.6-54 into
the continuity equation without sources or sinks gives the diffusion equation for ambipolar flow:
∂n
∂t −Da∇2n = 0
(3.6-56)
Since the electron and ion mobilities depend on the mass:
μe =
e
mν
μi =
e
Mν ,
(3.6-57)
it is usually possible to neglect the ion mobility. In this case, Eq. 3.6-55 combined with Eq. 3.6-25
gives
Da ≈kT
Mν + μi
μe
kT
mν = Di + μi
μe
De = Di 1 + Te
Ti
(3.6-58)
Since the electron temperature in thrusters is usually significantly higher than the ion temperature
(Te >> Ti), ambipolar diffusion greatly enhances the ion diffusion coefficient. Likewise, the smaller
ion mobility significantly decreases the ambipolar electron flux leaving the plasma.
3.6 Diffusion in Partially Ionized Plasma

3.6.3
Diffusion Across Magnetic Fields
Chargedparticle transportacross magneticfields isdescribedby whatiscalledclassicaldiffusiontheory
and non-classical or anomalous diffusion. Classical diffusion, which will be presented below, includes
both the case of particles of one species moving across the field due to collisions with another species
of particles, and the case of ambipolar diffusion across the field where the fluxes are constrained by
particle balance in the plasma. Anomalous diffusion can be caused by a number of different effects.
In ion and Hall thrusters, the anomalous diffusion has been described by Bohm diffusion [10], or is
due to anomalous resistivity from turbulent ion acoustic oscillations [1].
3.6.3.1
Classical Diffusion of Particles across B Fields
The fluid equation of motion for isothermal electrons moving in the perpendicular direction across
a magnetic field is
mn dv⊥
dt
= qn E + v⊥× B −kTe∇n −mnνv⊥
(3.6-59)
The same form of this equation can be written for ions with a mass M and temperature Ti. Consider
steady-state diffusion and set the time and convective derivatives equal to zero. Separating
Eq. 3.6-59 into x and y coordinates gives
mnνυx = qnEx + qnυyBo −kTe
∂n
∂x ,
(3.6-60)
and
mnνυy = qnEy + qnυxBo −kTe

where B = Bo(z). The x and y velocity components are then

(3.6-70)
both reduced by the fluid drag term (1 + ν2/ωc

ular cross-field electron flux flowing toward the wall or toward the anode is then
Γe = nv⊥= ± μ⊥nE −D⊥∇n,
(3.6-71)
which has the form of Fick’s Law but with the mobility and diffusion coefficients modified by the
magnetic field.
The “classical” cross-field diffusion coefficient D⊥, derived above and found in the literature
[1, 2], is proportional to 1/B2. However, in measurements in many plasma devices, including in
Kaufman ion thrusters and other thrusters, the perpendicular diffusion coefficient in some regions
is found to be described by the Bohm diffusion coefficient:
DB = 1
16
kTe
eB ,
(3.6-72)
which scales as 1/B. Therefore, Bohm diffusion often progresses at orders of magnitude higher
rates than classical diffusion. It has been proposed that Bohm diffusion results from collective
instabilities in the plasma. Assume that the perpendicular electron flux is proportional to the
E × B drift velocity,
Γe = nυ⊥
n E

(3.6-73)
Also assume that the maximum electric field that occurs in the plasma due to Debye shielding with
a potential ϕmax over a radius r is proportional to the electron temperature divided by the radius of

where C is a constant less than 1. The Bohm diffusion coefficient has an empirically determined
value of C = 1/16, as shown in Eq. 3.6-71, which fits most experiments with some uncertainty.
As pointed out in Chen [1], this is why it is no surprise that Bohm diffusion scales as kTe/eB.
3.6.3.2
Ambipolar Diffusion Across B Fields
Ambipolar diffusion across magnetic fields is much more complicated than the diffusion cases just
covered because the mobility and diffusion coefficients are anisotropic in the presence of a mag-
netic field. Since both quasi-neutrality and charge balance must be satisfied, ambipolar diffusion
dictates that the sum of the cross field and parallel to the field loss rates for both the ions and elec-
trons must be the same. This means that the divergence of the ion and electron fluxes must be equal.
While it is a simple matter to write equations for the divergence of these two species and equate
them, the resulting equation cannot be easily solved because it depends on the behavior both in
the plasma and at the boundary conditions.
A special case in which only the ambipolar diffusion toward a wall in the presence of a transverse
magnetic field is now considered. In this situation, charge balance is conserved separately along and
across the magnetic field lines. The transverse electron equation of motion for isothermal electrons,
including electron-neutral and electron-ion collisions, can be written as
mn ∂ve
∂t + ve ∇ve
= −en E + ve × B −kTe ∇n
−mnνen ve −vo −mnνei ve −vi
,
(3.6-76)
where vo is the neutral particle velocity. Taking the magnetic field to be in the z-direction, and
assuming the convective derivative to be negligibly small, then in steady state this equation can
be separated into the two transverse electron velocity components:
υx + μeEx +

(3.6-78)
where νe = νen + νei is the total collision frequency, μe = e/mνe is the electron mobility including
both ion and neutral collisional effects, and vo is neglected as being small compared to the electron
velocity υe. Solving for υy and eliminating the E × B and diamagnetic drift terms in the x-direction,
the transverse electron velocity is given by
υe 1 + μ2
eB2 = μe E + kTe

In this case, the electron mobility is reduced by the magnetic field (the first term on the right-hand
side of the equation), and so an electric field E is generated in the plasma to slow down the ion
transverse velocity to balance the pressure term and maintain ambipolarity. This is exactly the
opposite of the normal ambipolar diffusion without magnetic fields or along the magnetic field lines
covered in Section 3.6.2, where the electric field slowed the electrons and accelerated the ions to
maintain ambipolarity. Equation 3.6-81 can be written in terms the transverse flux as

Sheaths at the Boundaries of Plasmas
While the motion of the various particles in the plasma is important in understanding the behavior
and performance of electric thrusters, the boundaries of the plasma represent the physical interface
through which energy and particles enter and leave the plasma and the thruster. Depending on the
conditions, the plasma will establish potential and density variations at the boundaries to satisfy
particle balance or the imposed electrical conditions at the thruster walls. This region of potential
and density change is called the sheath, and understanding sheath formation and behavior is also
very important in understanding and modeling electric thruster plasmas.
Consider the generic plasma in Fig. 3-2 consisting of quasi-neutral ion and electrons densities
with temperatures given by Ti and Te, respectively. The ion current density to the boundary or
“wall” for singly-charged ions, to first order, is given by nievi, where υi is the ion velocity. Likewise,
the electron current density to the boundary wall, to first order, is given by neeve, where υe is the
electron velocity. The ratio of the electron current density to the ion current density going to the
boundary, assuming quasi-neutrality, is

Table 3-1 shows the mass ratio M/m for several gas

is orders of magnitude higher than the ion current
due to the much higher electron mobility. This

would make it impossible to maintain the assumption of quasi-neutrality in the plasma used in
Eq. 3.7-1 because the electrons would leave the volume much faster than the ions.
If different temperatures between the ions and electrons are allowed, the ratio of the current
densities to the boundary is given by

(3.7-3)
To balance the fluxes to the wall to satisfy charge continuity (an ionization event makes one ion and
one electron), the ion temperature would have to again be orders of magnitude higher than the
electron temperatures. In electric thrusters, the opposite is true and the electron temperature is
normally at least an order of magnitude higher than the ion temperature, which compounds
the problem of maintaining quasi-neutrality in a plasma.
In reality, if the electrons left the plasma volume faster than the ions, a charge imbalance would
result due to the large net ion charge left behind. This would produce a positive potential in the
plasma, which creates a retarding electric field for the electrons. The electrons would then be slo-
wed down and retained in the plasma. Potential gradients in the plasma and at the plasma bound-
ary are a natural consequence of the different temperatures and mobilities of the ions and electrons.
Potential gradients will develop at the wall or next to electrodes inserted into the plasma to main-
tain quasi-neutrality between the charged species. These regions with potential gradients are called
sheaths.
3.7.1
Debye Sheaths
To start an analysis of sheaths, assume that the positive and negative charges in the plasma are fixed
in space, but have any arbitrary distribution. It is then possible to solve for the potential distribution
everywhere using Maxwell’s equations. The integral form of Eq. 3.2-1 is Gauss’s Law:
s
E ds = 1

V
ρdV = Q
εo
(3.7-4)
where Q is the total enclosed charge in the volume V and s is the surface enclosing that charge. If an
arbitrary sphere of radius r is drawn around the enclosed charge, the electric field found from inte-
grating over the sphere is
E =
Q
4πεor2 r
(3.7-5)
Since the electric field is minus the gradient of the potential, the integral form of Eq. 3.2-2 can be
written

(3.7-7)
The potential decreases as 1/r moving away from the charge.
However, if the plasma is allowed to react to a test-charge placed inside the plasma, the potential
has a different behavior than predicted by Eq. 3.7-7. Utilizing Eq. 3.2-7 for the electric field in
Eq. 3.2-1 gives Poisson’s equation:

(3.7-8)
where the charge density in Eq. 3.2-5 has been used. Assume that the ions are singly-charged and
that the potential change around the test charge is small (eϕ << kTe), such that the ion density is
fixed and ni ≈no. Writing Poisson’s equation in spherical coordinates and using Eq. 3.5-9 to describe
the Boltzmann electron density behavior gives

(3.7-11)
By defining

as the characteristic Debye length, Eq. 3.7-11 can be written as
ϕ =

4πεor e
−rλD
(3.7-13)
This equation shows that the potential would normally fall off away from the test charge inserted in
the plasma as 1/r, as previously found, except that the electrons in the plasma have reacted to shield
the test charge and cause the potential to decrease exponentially away from it. This behavior of the
potential in the plasma is, of course, true for any structure such as a grid or probe that is placed in
the plasma and that has a net charge on it.
The Debye length is the characteristic distance over which the potential changes for potentials
that are small compared to kTe. It is common to assume that the sheath around an object will have a
thickness of the order of a few Debye lengths for the potential to fall to a negligible value away
from the object. As an example, consider a plasma with a density of 1017 m−3 and an electron

temperature of 1 eV. Boltzmann’s constant k is
1.3807 × 10−23 J/K and charge is 1.6022 × 10−19 C,
so the temperature corresponding to 1 electron volt is
T = 1
e
k
= 1 6022 × 10 −19
1 3807 × 10 −23 = 11,604 3 K
The Debye length, using the permittivity of free space
as 8.85 × 10−12F/m, is then
λD =

1 38 × 10 −23 11,604
1017 1 6 × 10 −19 2
1 2
= 2 35 × 10 −5m = 23 5 μm
A simplifying step to note in this calculation is that kTe/e in Eq. 3.7-12 has units of electron volts.
A handy formula for the Debye length is
λD cm ≈740
Tev no,
(3.7-14)
where Tev is in electron volts and no is the plasma density in cm−3.
3.7.2
Pre-sheaths
In the previous section, the sheath characteristics for the case of the potential difference
between the plasma and an electrode or boundary being small compared to the electron temper-
ature (eϕ << kTe) was analyzed and resulted in Debye shielding sheaths. What happens for the case
of potential differences on the order of the electron temperature? Consider a plasma in contact with
a boundary wall, as illustrated in Fig. 3-3. Assume that the plasma is at a reference potential Φ
at the center (which can be arbitrarily be set), and that cold ions fall through an arbitrary potential
of ϕo as they move toward the boundary. Conservation of energy states that the ions arrived at the
sheath edge with an energy given by
1
2 Mυ2
o = eϕo
(3.7-15)
This potential drop between the center of the plasma and the sheath edge, ϕo, is called the pre-
sheath potential. Once past the sheath edge, the ions then gain an additional energy given by
1
2 Mυ2 = 1
2 Mυ2
o −eϕ x ,
(3.7-16)
where υ is the ion velocity in the sheath and ϕ(x) is the potential through the sheath (becoming
more negative relative to center of the plasma). Using Eq. 3.7-15 in Eq. 3.7-16 and solving for
the ion velocity in the sheath gives
υ =
2e
M ϕo −ϕ 1 2
(3.7-17)
However, from Eq. 3.7-15 υo =
2eϕo M, so Eq. 3.7-17 can be rearranged to give

ni = no 1 −1

(3.7-21)
where the higher order terms in the series will be neglected.
The electron density through the sheath is given by the Boltzmann relationship in Eq. 3.5-9. If it is
also assumed that the change in potential right at the sheath edge is small compared to the electron
temperature, then the exponent in Eq. 3.5-9 can be expanded in a Taylor series to give

In order to have a monotonically decreasing potential from the center to the wall, which avoids an
inflection in the potential at the sheath edge that would slow or even reflect the ions going into the
sheath, the right-hand side of Eq. 3.7-23 must always be zero or positive, which implies:
1
2ϕo

kTe
(3.7-24)
This expression can be re-written as:
ϕo ≥kTe
2e ,
(3.7-25)
which is the Bohm Sheath Criterion [10] that states that the ions must fall through a “presheath”
potential in the plasma of at least TeV/2 before entering the sheath to produce a monotonically
decreasing sheath potential. Since the ion velocity entering the sheath is υo =
2eϕo M, the Bohm
Criterion in Eq. 3.7-25 can be expressed in the more familiar form as
υo ≥
kTe
M
(3.7-26)
This is usually called the Bohm velocity for ions entering a sheath. Equation 3.7-26 states that the
ions must enter the sheath with a velocity of at least
kTe M (known as the acoustic velocity for
3.7 Sheaths at the Boundaries of Plasmas
61

cold ions) to have a stable (monotonic) sheath potential behavior. The plasma produces a potential
drop of at least Te/2 in the pre-sheath region before the sheath to produce this ion velocity.
Although not derived here, if the ions have a finite temperature Ti, it is easy to show that the Bohm
velocity will still take the form of the ion acoustic velocity given by
υo =
γkTi + kTe
M
(3.7-27)
It is important to realize that the plasma density also decreases in the pre-sheath due to ion accel-
eration toward the wall. This is easily observed from the Boltzmann behavior of the plasma density,
where the potential at the sheath edge has fallen to a value of –kTe/2e relative to the plasma poten-
tial at the location where the density is no (far from the edge of the plasma). The electron density at
the sheath edge is then
ne = no exp eϕo
kTe

(3.7-28)
Therefore, the plasma density at the sheath edge is about 61% of the plasma density in the center of
the plasma.
The current density of ions entering the sheath at the edge of the plasma can be found from the
density at the sheath edge in Eq. 3.7-28 and the ion velocity at the sheath edge in Eq. 3.7-26:
Ji = 0 61noeυi ≈1

(3.7-29)
where n is the plasma density at the start of the pre-sheath, which is normally considered to be the

plasmas. It is common to write Eq. 3.7-29 as the Bohm current:
Ii = 1
2 ne
kTe
M A,
(3.7-30)
where A is the ion collection area at the sheath boundary. For example, consider a xenon ion
thruster with a 1018 m−3 plasma density and an electron temperature of 3 eV. The current density
of ions to the boundary of the ion acceleration structure is found to be 118 A m−2, and the Bohm
current to an area of 10−2 m2 is 1.18 A.
3.7.3
Child-Langmuir Sheath
The simplest case of a sheath in a plasma is obtained when the potential across the sheath is suf-
ficiently large that the electrons are repelled over the majority of the sheath thickness. This will
occur if the potential is very large compared to the electron temperature (ϕ >> kTe/e). This means
that the electron density goes to zero relatively close to the sheath edge, and the electron space
charge does not significantly affect the sheath thickness. The ion velocity through the sheath is
given by Eq. 3.7-17. The ion current density is then

This equation was originally derived by Child [11] in 1911 and independently derived by Langmuir
[12] in 1913. Equation 3.7-35 states that the current per unit area that can pass through a planar
sheath is limited by space charge effects that reduce the electric field at the x = 0 boundary, and is
proportional to the voltage to the 3/2 power divided by the sheath thickness squared. In ion thrus-
ters, the accelerator structure can be designed to first order using the Child-Langmuir equation
where d is the gap between the accelerator electrodes. The Child-Langmuir equation can be con-

3.7.4
Generalized Sheath Solution
To find the characteristics of any sheath without the simplifying assumptions used in the above

To obtain a solution for χ(ξ), Eq. 3.7-43 must be solved numerically. However, as was shown earlier
for Eq. 3.7-23, the right-hand side must always be positive or the potential will have an inflection at
or near the sheath edge. Expanding the right-hand side in a Taylor series and neglecting the higher
order terms, this equation will also produce the Bohm sheath criterion and specify that the ion
velocity at the sheath edge must equal or exceed the ion acoustic (or Bohm) velocity. An examina-
tion of Eq. 3.7-43 also shows that the Bohm sheath criterion forces the ion density to always be
larger than the electron density through the pre-sheath and sheath, which results in the physically
realistic monotonically decreasing potential behavior through the pre-sheath and sheath regions.

Hutchinson [13] derived an analytic expression for the sheath thickness assuming the electron
density in the sheath is negligible and the incident ion current density at the sheath edge is the
Bohm current given in Eq. 3.7-29. He found:

(3.7-44)
where V is the total potential difference in the sheath. Figure 3-4 shows a plot of the sheath thick-
ness d relative to the Debye length versus the total potential drop in the sheath normalized to the
electron temperature. The criterion for a Debye sheath derived in Section 3.7.1 was that the poten-
tial drop is much less than the electron temperature (eϕ << kTe), which is on the far left-hand side
of the graph. The criterion for a Child-Langmuir sheath derived in Section 3.7.3 is that the sheath
potential is large compared to the electron temperature (eϕ >> kTe), which occurs on the right-
hand side of the graph. This graph illustrates the rule-of-thumb that the sheath thickness is
several Debye lengths until the full Child-Langmuir conditions are established. Beyond this
point, the sheath thickness varies as the potential to the 3/2 power for a given plasma density.
The reason for examining this general case is because sheaths with potential drops on the order of
the electron temperature or higher are typically found at both the anode and insulating surfaces in
ion and Hall thrusters. For example, it will be shown later that an insulating surface exposed to a
xenon plasma will self-bias to a potential of about ϕ
6Te, which is called the floating potential. For
a plasma with an electron temperature of 4 eV and a density of 1018 m−3, the Debye length from
Eq. 3.7-12 is 1.5 × 10−5 m and the sheath thickness from Eq. 3.7-44 is about 6 Debye lengths. Once
the potential is significantly greater than the electron temperature, the sheath thickness is many
times this value and the sheath transitions to a Child-Langmuir sheath.
3.7.5
Double Sheaths
So far, only plasma boundaries where particles from the plasma are flowing toward a wall have been
considered. At other locations in electric thrusters, such as in some cathode and accelerator struc-
tures, a situation may exist where two plasmas are in contact but at different potentials and ion and

electron currents flowbetween theplasmas inopposite
directions. This situation is called a double sheath, or
double layer, and is illustrated in Fig. 3-5. In this case,
electrons flow from the zero-potential boundary on the
left and ions flow from the boundary at a potential ϕs
on the right. Since the particle velocities are relatively
slow near the plasma boundaries before the sheath
acceleration takes place, the local space charge effects
are significant and the local electric field is reduced at
both boundaries. The gradient of the potential inside
the double layer is therefore much higher than in
the vacuum case where the potential varies linearly
in between the boundaries.
Referring again to Fig. 3-5, assume that boundary
on the left is at zero potential and that the particles arrive at the sheath edge on both sides of
the double layer with zero initial velocity. The potential difference between the surfaces accelerates
the particles in the opposite direction across the double layer. The electron conservation of
energy gives

3 Basic Plasma Physics

For space-charge-limited current flow, the electric field at the right-hand boundary (the edge of the
plasma) is zero and the potential is ϕ = ϕs. Putting that boundary condition into Eq. 3.7-49 and
solving for the current density gives
Je =
M
mJi
(3.7-50)
If the area of the two plasmas in contact with each other is the same, the electron current crossing
the double layer is the square root of the mass ratio times the ion current crossing the layer. This
situation is called the Langmuir Condition (1929) and describes the space-charge-limited flow of
ions and electrons between two plasmas or between a plasma and an electron emitter.
For finite initial velocities, Eq. 3.7-50 was corrected by Andrews and Allen [14] to give
Je = κ
M
mJi,
(3.7-51)
where κ is a constant that varies from 0.2 to 0.8 for Te/Ti changing from 2 to about 20. For typical
thruster plasmas where Te/Ti ≈10, κ is about 0.5.
While the presence of free-standing double layers in the plasma volume in thrusters is
often debated, the sheath at a thermionic cathode surface certainly satisfies the criteria of
counter-streaming ion and electron currents and can be viewed as a double layer. In this case,
Eq. 3.7-51 describes the space charge limited current density that a plasma can accept from an
electron-emitting cathode surface. This is useful in that the maximum current density that
can be drawn from a cathode can be evaluated if the plasma parameters at the sheath edge in
contact with the cathode are known (such that Ji can be evaluated from the Bohm current), with-
out requiring that the actual sheath thickness be known.
Finally, there are several conditions for the formation of the classic double layer described here.
To achieve a potential difference between the plasmas that is large compared to the local electron
temperature, charge separation must occur in the layer. This, of course, violates quasi-neutrality
locally. The current flow across the layer is space-charge limited, which means that the electric field
is essentially zero at both boundaries. Finally, the flow through the layer discussed here is collision-
less. Collisions cause resistive voltage drops where current is flowing, which can easily be mistaken
for the potential difference across a double layer.

Summary of Sheath Effects
It is worthwhile to summarize here some of the important equations in this section related to
sheaths because these will be very useful later in describing thruster performance. These equations
were derived in the sections above, and alternative derivations can be found in the referenced text-
books [1–3].
The current density of ions entering the sheath at the edge of the plasma is given by:
Ji = 0 6 ne υi ≈1
2 ne

M ,
(3.7-52)
where n is the plasma density at the start of the pre-sheath far from the boundary, which was con-
sidered to be the center of the plasma by Langmuir for his collisionless plasmas. The convention of
approximating the coefficient 0.6 as ½ was made by Bohm in defining what is now called the
“Bohm current”.
3.7 Sheaths at the Boundaries of Plasmas

If there is no net current to the boundary, the ion and electron currents must be equal. The Bohm
current of ions through the sheath is given by the current density in Eq. 3.7-52 times the wall area A:

where the potential ϕ is relative to the plasma potential at the plasma center and is by convention a

This is the potential at which the plasma will self-bias to have zero net current to the walls and
thereby conserve charge, and is often called the floating potential. Note that the floating potential
is negative relative to the plasma potential.
For sheath potentials less than the electron temperature, the sheath thickness is given by the
Debye length (Eq. 3.7-12):
λD =
εokTe
noe2
(3.7-56)
For sheath potentials greater than the electron temperature (eϕ > kTe), a pre-sheath forms to
accelerate the ions into the sheath to avoid any inflection in the potential at the sheath edge.
The collisionless pre-sheath has a potential difference from the center of the plasma to the sheath
edge of TeV/2 and a density decrease from the center of the plasma to the sheath edge of 0.61no.
The TeV/2 potential difference accelerates the ions to the Bohm velocity
υBohm = υB =

(3.7-57)
The sheath thickness at the wall depends on the plasma parameters and the potential difference
between the plasma and the wall, and is found from the solution of Eq. 3.7-43.
For the case of sheath potentials that are large compared to the electron temperature (eϕ >> kTe),
the current density through the sheath is described by the Child-Langmuir equation

If one boundary of the double layer is the sheath edge at a thermionic cathode, Eq. 3.7-53 can

This is the maximum electron current density that can be accepted by a plasma due to space-charge
effects at the cathode double-sheath. For example, the maximum space-charge-limited cathode
emission current into a xenon plasma with a density of 1018 m−3 and an electron temperature of
5 eV is about 3.8 A cm−2.
These summary equations are commonly seen in the literature on the design and analysis of ion
sources, plasma processing sources, and, of course, electric thrusters.

Hollow Cathodes
Nearly all electric thrusters require an electron emitter for discharge current generation, propellant
ionization, and ion beam charge neutralization. Most of these electron emitters are configured as
hollow cathodes due to their compact size, high current capability, and long life. Hollow cathodes
are straightforward to ignite with a momentary heater, rf exciter, or Paschen discharge. Once
ignited they are self-heated; varying their voltage drop to provide the thermionic electron emitter
heating necessary to produce the desired discharge current. They operate on a wide variety of pro-
pellants and can be scaled to produce discharge currents from fractions of an ampere to hundreds of
amperes. The properties of the cathode material, the physical configuration of the hollow cathode,
and structure and behavior of the cathode plasma determine, to a large extent, the performance and
life of the thruster.
4.1
Introduction
Early electron-bombardment ion thrusters developed in the 1950s utilized directly heated tungsten
or tantalum filaments as the cathode that emitted electrons for the plasma discharge used to pro-
duce the ions. Smaller tungsten filaments were also immersed directly into the ion beam to provide
neutralizing electrons. Owing to the high work function of these refractory metals, the filaments
had to be operated at temperatures of over 2400 C to emit electron current densities in excess of
1 A/cm2. Operation at these temperatures requires high heater power, often on the order of the
discharge power, which significantly reduces the efficiency of the thruster. In addition, the life
of refractory metal filament cathodes is limited by rapid evaporation of the filament material at
the elevated temperatures and by ion bombardment sputtering of the surfaces exposed to the dis-
charge plasma in the thruster or in the beam. Filament cathode life was typically limited to the
order of only tens to hundreds of hours. Although the use of filament cathodes permitted early
development of ion thruster discharge chambers and accelerator grids, they were inadequate for
long-life space applications.
This problem was solved by the development of hollow cathodes. The first description of a dis-
charge in a “hollow cathode” was by F. Paschen [1] in 1916. Hollow cathodes are characterized by a
reentrant geometry where the internal plasma is at least partially bounded by electrode walls that
are at cathode potential. Ionizing electrons produced in the discharge reflect from the cathode-
potential walls, which increases their path length before loss and thereby increases the plasma

density and cathode emission current capability. Hollow cathodes made before the 1960s primarily
used Paschen breakdowns [1] to initiate a low current glow discharge that produced higher plasma
densities due to the reentrant cathode geometry.
In the early 1960s, Lidsky [2] developed what was then called a “hollow cathode arc discharge”
where the reentrant cathode was a simple open-ended refractory metal tube at cathode potential
with gas flowing through it. The discharge was started by a Paschen breakdown from the tip of the
tube to the cylindrical anode and transitioned into a high-current thermionic discharge deeper
inside the tube once the discharge produced sufficient heating of the refractory metal wall to reach
thermionic emission temperatures (>> 2400 C). These cathodes produced high discharge currents
and high plasma densities, but had limited life due to the high evaporation rates of the refractory
metal tube wall at the temperatures required for operation.
The first purely thermionic hollow cathode was invented by Forrester [3] in the mid-1960s for use
as a neutralizer cathode for cesium surface ionization ion thrusters. This cathode featured a tung-
sten tube with a small orifice at the exit and an external heater to start the discharge. The cesium
propellant injected into the tube produced a very low work function Cs-W surface on the inside
wall, and the emitted electrons were extracted from the cesium plasma through the orifice. The
plasma produced by this cathode was used as a “plasma-bridge neutralizer” that delivered electrons
to the ion beam [3], eliminating the life limitations of filament electron emitters immersed in the
beam that were subject to ion sputtering. Pawlik [4] modified this design for use with mercury pro-
pellants by placing a thermionic emitter “insert” inside the hollow cathode. Early plasma-bridge
neutralizer cathodes were required to produce less than 1 A of current and operate for lifetimes
of less than a year, which Pawlik achieved with simple oxide-coated rolled-up metal foil inserts
in small diameter hollow tubes with small orifices. The first employment of such an “orificed hol-
low cathode” with a thermionic emitter on a spaceflight electric propulsion system was in 1970
onboard NASA’s Space Electric Rocket Test (SERT 2) [5]. Rawlin [6, 7] replaced the oxide-coated
insert with barium oxide dispenser cathode inserts in the 1970s to provide higher electron currents
(up to 10 A) and longer life for use as the main discharge cathode in both mercury and inert gas ion
thrusters. At about that same time in the 1970s, the lanthanum hexaboride hollow cathode was
invented in the United States by Goebel [8] to provide even higher discharge currents from tens
to hundreds of amperes. All of these cathode types have been matured since that time to produce
higher discharge currents and longer life for electric propulsion applications [9, 10], but the basic
geometry has remained the same.
A generic hollow cathode is shown in Fig. 4-1, where the cathode consists of a hollow refractory
tube with an orifice plate on the downstream end. The tube has an insert in the shape of a cylinder

that is placed inside the tube and pushed against the orifice plate. This insert is the active electron
emitter and it can be made of several different materials that provide a low work function surface on
the inside diameter in contact with the cathode plasma. The cathode tube is wrapped with a heater
(a co-axial sheathed heater is shown in the figure) that raises the insert temperature to emissive
temperatures to start the discharge. Outside the cathode tube assembly is a keeper electrode that
is biased to help start the cathode and also protects the cathode from back ion bombardment sput-
tering. The electrons emitted from the insert ionize gas injected through the cathode tube and form
a cathode plasma from which the discharge current electrons are extracted through the orifice into
the thruster plasma.
A hollow cathode can be separated into three distinct plasma regions illustrated in Fig. 4-2:
A dense plasma in the insert region interior to the cathode, a high current density plasma in
the orifice, and a low-density plume plasma outside the cathode that completes the electrical con-
nection to the thruster discharge plasma. The plasma ions generated throughout the device neu-
tralize the electron space charge. As a result, hollow cathodes produce high currents at low
voltages compared to vacuum cathode devices.
The structure of the hollow cathode serves three main functions. First, some fraction of the
thruster propellant is injected through the hollow cathode and the discharge inside the resulting
high neutral pressure region generates a cold, high-density plasma. The plasma and neutral den-
sities are the highest of anywhere in the thruster and the electron temperature is correspondingly
the lowest. This causes the plasma potential inside the hollow cathode to be very low, reducing the
energy of the ions that arrive at the insert surface. This characteristic behavior is demonstrated in
Fig. 4-3, which shows the measured potential and density profiles in the Nuclear-Electric Xenon
Ion System (NEXIS) hollow cathode [11] discharge. Plasma densities in excess of 1019 m−3 are rou-
tinely generated inside hollow cathodes and the electron temperature is found [11, 12] to be only
1–3 eV. The low plasma potential in the insert region and high neutral scattering rates decrease the
ion bombardment energy striking the insert surface to typically less than 20 eV, which essentially
eliminates ion sputtering of the surface and greatly increases the life of the cathode. Second, the
high-density plasma in the insert region eliminates space charge effects at the cathode surface that
can limit the electron emission current density. Emission current densities of 1–10 A/cm2 are typ-
ically employed in thruster hollow cathodes for compact size and good life, although higher current
densities are achievable and sometimes used. Third, the cathode insert can be heat-shielded well in
this geometry, which greatly reduces the radiation losses of the cathode at operating temperatures.
This decreases the amount of power that must be deposited in the cathode to maintain the required
temperature for electron emission. It also reduces the cathode heating losses to a small fraction of
the discharge power, significantly reducing the discharge loss of the plasma generator.

4.1 Introduction
73

Since nearly the entire discharge current runs through the orifice, which is the region of the cath-
ode with the smallest cross-sectional area, the current density there is the highest in the system and
a sufficient plasma density must be generated locally to carry the current. For the 25-A discharge
case shown in Fig. 4-3, the plasma density in the orifice is on the order of 1020 m−3. The discharge
current flowing through the 0.25-cm diameter orifice in this cathode is given by
I = neυA
4 1-1
where n is the plasma density, e is the electron charge, υ is the electron drift velocity and A is the
cross sectional area of the orifice. Solving for the drift velocity gives
υ =
I
neA = 7 7 × 104 m s << υth,
4 1-2
where the thermal electron drift velocity υth =
kTe m is 6 × 105 m/s for the 2 eV plasma elec-
tron temperatures measured in this location. The current is conducted through the orifice region at
relatively low drift velocities, even though the electron current density exceeds 100 A/cm2 in this
case. This is typically true even at current densities exceeding 1000 A/cm2.
In the plume region, the expanding plasma from the orifice region and ionization of the expand-
ing neutral gas provide an ion background that neutralizes the space charge of the current carrying
electrons. Hollow cathodes are normally enclosed in another electrode called a keeper, shown in
Fig. 4-4. The major functions of the keeper electrode are to facilitate turning on the cathode dis-
charge, to maintain the cathode temperature and operation in the event that the discharge or beam

current is interrupted temporarily, and to protect the cathode orifice plate and external heater from
high-energy ion bombardment that might limit the cathode life. The keeper is normally biased pos-
itive relative to the cathode, which either initiates the discharge during start-up, or reduces the ion
bombardment energy during normal operation. The life of the keeper electrode is very important to
the life of the cathode and thruster.
Hollow cathodes operate in a “self-heating” mode where the external heater or heater-plasma
discharge is turned off during operation and the cathode insert is heated by plasma bombardment
from the insert-region plasma. There are three self-heating mechanisms possible in hollow cath-
odes: (i) orifice heating, (ii) ion heating, and (iii) electron heating. In orifice heating, the cathode
is designed with a small-diameter, restrictive orifice, which produces a high internal density and
pressure in both the insert and orifice regions. The plasma discharge passing through the orifice
is then very resistive, causing a significant amount of power to be deposited in the orifice plasma
and transferred to the orifice walls by convection. This power deposition then heats the thermionic
insert by conduction and radiation. Orifice heating is used primarily in low current cathodes, like
ion-beam neutralizer cathodes, where the discharge currents are very low. Ion heating is the classic
mechanism for cathode heating where ions in the cathode insert-region plasma fall through the
sheath potential at the insert surface and heat the surface by ion bombardment. Electron heating
occurs in a regime where both the cathode internal pressure and the discharge current are relatively
high, resulting in the very high plasma densities (>1020 m−3) generated in the insert region. The low
electron temperatures and low sheath voltages produced in this situation result in the energetic tail
of the Maxwellian electron distribution having sufficient energy to exceed the sheath potential and
reach the insert surface. These electrons then deposit their energy on the insert and heat it to emis-
sion temperatures. The heating mechanism that dominates in any hollow cathode design depends
on the geometry of the cathode, the internal neutral gas pressure in the insert and orifice regions,
and the discharge current.
This chapter will start with a simple classification of different hollow cathode geometries to aid in
the discussion of the important effects in the system, and then discuss the basics of the cathode

insert that provides thermionic electron emission. The characteristics of the plasma in the insert
region, the orifice, and cathode plume in the vicinity of the keeper required to extract and transmit
the electrons into the thruster will then be examined. Since the neutral gas density changes all along
the discharge path in hollow cathode discharges, the plasmas generated in each location (inside the
insert, in the orifice, and in the cathode plume) have different properties in terms of collisionality,
temperature, potential, and density. These differences determine the applicable plasma physics in
each region.
4.2
Cathode Configurations
The geometry and size of the hollow cathodes depends on the amount of current they are required
to emit. Discharge currents in ion thrusters are typically 5–10 times the beam current depending on
the efficiency of the plasma generator, and discharge currents can range from a few amperes to over
100 A[13] depending on the size of the thruster. The hollow cathode used in a Hall thruster provides
electrons for both ionization of the propellant gas and
neutralization of the beam [14]. Hall thrusters also tend
to run at lower specific impulse (Isp) than ion thrusters
for a given thruster power level. Therefore, Hall thrusters
require higher discharge currents from the cathode to
achieve the same total power compared to ion thrusters,
and currents of the order of 10 A to hundreds of amperes
are needed. Neutralizer cathodes in ion thrusters [15] emit
electrons at a current equal to the beam current. There-
fore, they can be made smaller than discharge cathodes
and must be designed to be self-heated and run reliably
at lower currents.
Higher discharge currents require larger insert surface
areas because the electron emission current density avail-
able from thermionic cathodes is limited by the cathode
properties. Ultimately, this determines the diameter of
the insert and the hollow cathode, which will be described
in the next section. The cathode orifice diameter and
length depend on many parameters. Ion thruster neutral-
izer cathodes have been designed with very small diame-
ter orifices (≤3 × 10−2 cm), and ion thruster discharge
cathodes and small Hall thruster cathodes have been
designed with orifices of less than 0.1-cm diameter to over
0.3 cm in diameter. High current hollow cathodes for large
ion thrusters and Hall thrusters will have even larger ori-
fices. These cathodes are sometimes designed even with-
out an orifice, where the insert inner diameter forms a
tube exposed to the discharge plasma.
Hollow cathodes generally fall into the three categories
shown schematically in Fig. 4-5, which will be useful later
in describing the plasma characteristics in the three

regions described above. The first type of hollow cathode is characterized by a small orifice (com-
pared to the insert diameter) with a large length to diameter ratio, and called Type A. These cath-
odes typical operate at low current and relatively high internal gas pressures, and are heated
primarily by cathode orifice heating. The second type of cathode features an orifice diameter typ-
ically larger than the length, shown in Fig. 4-5 as Type B, and operates at lower internal gas pres-
sures. The heating mechanism in these cathodes is typically due to a combination of electron and
ion bombardment of the insert that depends on the orifice size and operating condition. The third
type of cathode, typically used in high current applications and shown in Fig. 4-5 as Type C, has a
very large diameter cathode orifice or essentially no orifice at all. These cathodes typically have a
reduced internal pressure overall compared to orificed cathodes. The heating mechanism for Type
C cathodes is normally ion bombardment of the insert.
The geometry of the hollow cathode and conditions at which it is operated critically affect the
maximum plasma density and its gradient in the cathode interior [16, 17]. Figure 4-6 shows exam-
ples of plasma density profiles measured along the cathode centerline with fast scanning probes
[11] inside a 0.38 cm inside diameter (I.D.) cathode insert operating at 13 A of discharge current
and a xenon flow rate of 3.7 sccm for two different orifice diameters and the case of no orifice plate
at all. Small orifices, characteristic of Type A cathodes, operate at high internal pressures and pro-
duce high plasma densities but constrain the axial extent of the plasma to the order of a few milli-
meters. For a given emission current density, this can restrict the discharge current that is available.
As the orifice is enlarged, the plasma extends farther into the insert, resulting in utilization of more
insert surface area for electron emission. This is illustrated in Fig. 4-7 that shows a numerical sim-
ulation [18] of the Type A, B, and C cathodes and illustrates how the orifice selection strongly affects
the internal plasma density distribution. Likewise, for a fixed orifice size and discharge current,
increasing the gas flow rate increases the internal pressure and is observed to produce a steeper
plasma density gradient upstream of the peak value while that peak density value moves closer
to the orifice plate.

The effect on the internal plasma density of increasing the discharge current in a given cathode
design at a constant flow rate [19] is illustrated in Fig. 4-8. Increasing the discharge current raises
the plasma density and also tends to push the plasma downstream toward the orifice plate. This
motion of the plasma can become problematic because, as the plasma density upstream falls,
the electron emission can become locally space charge limited [20]. This will force the cathode
to emit more of the discharge current from a smaller area downstream, which will require higher
insert temperatures and produce higher evaporation rates. Higher currents also typically require

4 Hollow Cathodes

higher gas flow rates to avoid instabilities outside the cathode in the near cathode plume (discussed
in Section 4.6), which also push the plasma downstream and reduce the contact area between the
plasma and the insert. For very high current hollow cathodes in excess of 100 A, this behavior drives
the cathode design to larger insert diameters with more emitting surface area near the orifice plate,
and to larger orifice diameters to provide as much plasma penetration and insert contact area as
possible.
Determining the spatial variations of the plasma parameters inside the cathode as the operating
conditions and/or geometry are changed is an inherently two-dimensional (2-D) problem that
involves a number of coupled nonlinear processes, both in the plasma region and along the bound-
aries. Hence, a detailed description of the profiles is not possible using low-dimensional idealized
models which provide only global descriptions of the plasma. A detailed discussion on this topic is
included in Section 4.4.
Depending on the orifice diameter, the electron current density in the orifice can be the highest of
anywhere in the system and can easily exceed 1 kA/cm2. If the orifice is long compared with its
radius, as is the case in most Type A neutralizer hollow cathodes, the physics is the same as a clas-
sical positive column plasma where an axial electric field in the collisional plasma conducts the
current, and plasma resistive heating is very important. A large fraction of this ohmic power depos-
ited in the orifice plasma goes into heating the orifice plate by ion bombardment, which contributes
to the insert heating by conduction and radiation. In Type B cathodes, the cathode orifice plate is
typically thin compared to the orifice diameter, and there is little local resistive heating. The plasma
in the insert region is generated by ionization of the neutral gas by the discharge current flowing
through the insert region into the orifice. At high cathode neutral gas flow rates (and subsequent
high plasma density) in this type of cathode, the insert heating is primarily by plasma electrons. At
low flow rates or with large orifices, the insert is heated predominately due to bombardment by ions
accelerated by a higher sheath voltage. In Type C cathodes, there is little or no orifice and the
plasma couples from a collisionally dominated region upstream inside the insert directly into

the nearly collisionless cathode plume region. This creates long axial density and potential gradi-
ents and may expose some of the downstream region of the insert to higher potentials and ion bom-
bardment. Heating in this case is predominately by ion bombardment through the higher cathode
sheath potential. Without an orifice plate, the downstream end of the insert radiates more freely
and runs cooler than it would if there had been an orifice plate.
Naturally, there is a continuous range of cathode operation that may demonstrate properties of all
three cathode types. Indeed, a given cathode geometry can transition from low resistive heating in
the orifice at low currents and low gas flow rates to substantial resistive heating and plasma gen-
eration at high currents and high gas flow rates. These three types of hollow cathodes will be dis-
cussed in more detail after the thermionic electron emitter properties are described in the next
section.
4.3
Thermionic Electron Emitters
Electrons are introduced into the hollow cathode by thermionic emission from the insert surface.
The thermionic current density is described by the Richardson-Dushman equation [21]:
J = AT2e −eϕwf kT
4 3-1
where A is, ideally, a constant with a value of 120 A/cm2 K2, T is the temperature in Kelvin, e in the
exponent is the charge, k is Boltzmann’s constant, and ϕwf is the work function of the surface.
Experimental investigations of the thermionic emission of different materials reported values of
A that vary considerably from the theoretical value. The cause of the deviation of A from a constant
has been attributed to several different effects such as variations in the crystal structure of the sur-
face, variations in the surface coverage (for dispenser cathodes), changes in the density of states at
the surface due to thermal expansion, etc. This issue has been addressed [22] for many of the therm-
ionic electron emitters used in hollow cathodes by introducing a temperature correction for the
work function of the form
ϕwf = ϕo + αT,
4 3-2
where ϕo is the classically reported work function and α is an experimentally measured constant.
This dependence can be inserted into Eq. 4.3-1 to give
J = Ae −eα kT2e −eϕwf kT = DT2e −eϕo kT,
4 3-3
where D is a material-specific modification to the Richardson-Dushman equation.
In the presence of strong electric fields at the surface of the cathode, the potential barrier that
must be overcome by the electrons in the material’s conduction band is reduced, which results
effectively in a reduced work function. This effect was first analyzed by Schottky [23], and the
so-called Schottky effect is included in the emission equation by the addition of a term [24] to
describe the effect of the surface electric field on the emission current density:
J = DT2e −eϕo kT exp
e
kT
eE
4πεo
,
4 3-4
where E is the electric field at the emitting surface. The Schottky effect often becomes significant
inside hollow cathodes where the plasma density is very high and the electric field in the sheath
becomes significant.

4 Hollow Cathodes

The properties of the material selected for the thermionic emitter or insert determine the required
operating temperature of the cathode for a given emission current. The work functions and values
of D found in the literature for several common cathode materials are summarized in Table 4-1. The
refractory metals are seen to have work functions in excess of 4 eV, and so they must operate at very
high temperatures to achieve significant emission current density.
The so-called “oxide” cathodes have work functions of about 2 eV and so are capable of producing
high emission current densities at temperatures under 1000 C. Oxide layers, such as barium oxide,
were first deposited on tungsten or nickel filaments to lower the work function and reduce the
heater power required. However, these surface layers eventually evaporate and are easily sputtered
by ion bombardment, limiting the life in vacuum applications to thousands of hours and in plasma
discharges to tens of hours. This problem was mitigated by the development of dispenser cathodes,
where a reservoir of the oxide material is fabricated into the tungsten substrate that continuously
re-supplies the low work function surface layer. The most commonly used dispenser cathode in
thrusters, the “Phillips Type-S,” uses a porous tungsten matrix that is impregnated with an emissive
mix of barium and calcium oxides and alumina. Different molar concentrations of the three con-
stituents of the emissive mix are used depending on the required emission current density and life.
The matrix material containing the impregnate can be directly heated by passing a current through
the material, or configured as an insert placed inside a hollow cathode with a radiatively coupled
heater.
In dispenser cathodes, chemical reactions in the pores of the matrix or at the surface at high tem-
peratures reduce the emissive material and evolve a barium oxide dipole attached to an active site
on the tungsten substrate. The work function of various molar concentrations of the impregnate has
been measured and is summarized in Cronin [25]. The most commonly used dispenser cathode in
electric thrusters has a 4 : 1 : 1 stoichiometric mix of barium calcium aluminate (4BaO: 1CaO:
1Al2O3) as the impregnate, and its work function is found from Table 4-1 to be 2.06 eV at tempera-
tures of about 1100 C. However, the actual work function of the surface is strongly dependent on
the surface coverage of the tungsten by the barium oxide dipoles. At higher temperatures, the evap-
oration rate of the barium on the surface will exceed the supply rate from the impregnate diffusing
up through the pores, and the work function will increase. A detailed analysis by Longo [26, 27]

where E = Eoe−ζ/T is a fitting function related to the surface activation energy, τ is the surface
desorption time constant, ζ is the activation energy for surface desorption, T is the surface temper-
ature, γ is a constant with units kh−1, and t is the operation time in kh. The numerical values in this
equation were determined empirically from cathode life testing results. The surface coverage θ
ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 corresponds to a monolayer of barium on the surface. The activation
energy for barium desorption from a 4 : 1 : 1 dispenser cathode expressed as a temperature is about
26,500 K. As the cathode ages, the supply of barium at a given temperature decreases and the sur-
face coverage decreases. This ultimately determines the life time of the cathode because as the bar-
ium impregnate is depleted and the surface coverage decreases, the work function rises. The
cathode then has to be at a higher temperature to produce the same desired emission current,
and the evaporation rate increases further. This causes runaway as barium is rapidly depleted from
the pores and the cathode fails.
The work function of the barium-tungsten dispenser cathode as a function of the surface coverage
was analyzed by Mueller [28], who found

the effective polarizability of the dipole in Å3, N is the surface coverage in 1015 atoms/cm2, and c is a
constant. The behavior of the barium oxide surface coverage and work function with temperature
from the Longo/Mueller models for a 4 : 1 : 1 dispenser cathode is shown in Fig. 4-9. For compar-
ison, the corresponding work function reported by Cronin [25] in Table 4-1 is also shown. The
agreement at low temperatures is good, but at temperatures above 1200 C the reduced surface

coverage predicted by Longo increases the work function above that from the Cronin fit. This limits
the maximum electron emission current density of barium oxide dispenser cathodes.
The electron emission current density, calculated using Eq. 4.3-3 for several different emitter
materials given in Table 4-1, is shown in Fig. 4-10. The barium oxide on tungsten dispenser cathode
provides emission current densities of 10 A/cm2 at surface temperatures of about 1100 C. The max-
imum current density for this cathode is seen to be 20 A/cm2 at temperatures of 1200 C, above
which the barium surface coverage cannot be maintained by diffusion from the pores and the emis-
sion current density falls off.
The work function of dispenser cathodes can be further reduced by the introduction of small
amounts of other refractory materials, such as iridium or osmium, in the tungsten matrix. These
“mixed metal matrix” cathodes can have work functions below 1.9 eV, and they typically slow some
of the chemical reactions that take place in the cathode. It was also found that the addition of scan-
dium to the surface of the barium oxide dispenser cathode reduces the work function significantly.
This is shown in Fig. 4-10 where the reported work function for a scandate cathode [29] at 1100 C is
about 1.7 eV, which is significantly less than the 2.06 eV for the BaO-W dispenser cathode. This results
in much lower temperatures for a given emission current density. Although fabricating stable, long-
life scandate electron emitters can be challenging, scandate-BaO-W dispenser cathodes have been
developed [30] and successfully used in several different hollow cathodes in electric thrusters.
Because chemistry is involved in the formation of the low work function surface in dispenser
cathodes, they are subject to poisoning that can significantly increase the work function
[31, 32]. Some care must be taken in handling the inserts and in the vacuum conditions used during
operation of these cathodes to avoid poisoning by impurities in the propellant that produce unre-
liable emission and shorten the lifetime. In addition, propellant impurities can also react with the
tungsten insert at higher temperatures (above 1100 C) causing migration and deposition of tung-
sten or tungstates (compounds of tungsten, barium, and oxygen) on the surface, which change the
surface structure and porosity and can reduce the surface coverage of the low work function
BaO layer. One of the major drawbacks of using BaO dispenser cathodes in electric propulsion
applications is the extremely high propellant gas purity specified to avoid these poisoning and tung-
sten-material transport issues, which has resulted in a special “propulsion-grade” xenon with
99.9995% purity to be specified by most users of these cathodes for flight.

4.3 Thermionic Electron Emitters

Another electron emitter material commonly used in electric thruster applications is lanthanum
hexaboride (LaB6) [33], which is a crystalline material first developed as an electron emitter by Laff-
erty in the 1950s. It is made for inserts by press sintering LaB6 powder into rods or plates and then
machining the solid material to the desired shape. Polycrystalline LaB6 cathodes have a work func-
tion of about 2.67 eV [34, 35], depending on the surface stoichiometry [36], and will emit over
10 A/cm2 at a temperature of 1650 C, as shown in Fig. 4-10. Since the bulk material is emitting,
there is no chemistry directly involved in establishing the low work function surface and LaB6 cath-
odes are insensitive to impurities and air exposures that can destroy a BaO dispenser cathode [37].
LaB6 cathodes can withstand gas-feed impurity levels two orders of magnitude higher than dis-
penser cathodes at the same emission current density. In addition, the cathode life is determined
primarily by the low evaporation rate of the LaB6 material at typical operating temperatures. The
higher operating temperature of bulk LaB6 and the need to support and make electrical contact
with LaB6 with materials that inhibit boron diffusion at the operating temperatures require some
careful engineering of the cathode structure. However, LaB6 cathodes are commonly used in Rus-
sian Hall thrusters in communications satellite applications [14, 38].
The first reported use of LaB6 in a hollow cathode was by Goebel [8] in 1978, and the development
of a high-current LaB6 cathode for plasma sources that dealt with supporting, heating, and making
electrical contact with the material was described by him in 1985 [39].The lanthanum-boron system
can consist of combinations of stable LaB4, LaB6, and LaB9 compounds, with the surface color
determined [40] by the dominant compound. The evolution of LaB4 to LaB9 compounds is caused
either by preferential sputtering of the boron or lanthanum atoms at the surface by energetic ion
bombardment [39], or by preferential chemical reactions with the surface atoms [36]. However, a
lanthanum-boride compound, when heated in excess of 1000 C in reasonable vacuum, will evap-
orate its component atoms at rates that produces a stable LaB6.0 surface [34]. Lanthanum hexabor-
ide can be heated indirectly by internal or external radiative heaters [37, 39], or directly heated in a
filament configuration [41].
Dispenser cathodes and LaB6 cathodes offer long lifetimes in thruster applications because the
evaporation rate is significantly lower than for refractory metals. Figure 4-11 shows the evaporation

rate as a function of the emission current density for a Type-S 4 : 1 : 1 dispenser cathode [32],
LaB6[33] and tungsten [22] (for comparison). The dispenser cathode and LaB6 cathode evaporation
rates are more than one order of magnitude lower compared to tungsten at the same emission cur-
rent density. As discussed above, excessive evaporation of barium and reduced surface coverage
limit the current density of dispenser cathodes to less than about 20 A/cm2 in continuous operation.
Despite operating at a significantly higher temperature than the barium cathode, the LaB6 has a
lower evaporation rate until the emission current exceeds about 15 A/cm2 and can provide longer
life. The life of these cathodes is discussed in more detail in Section 4.8.
4.4
Insert Region
The insert region of the hollow cathode, as was illustrated in Fig. 4-4, usually has a cylindrical geom-
etry with electron emission from the interior surface of a thermionic insert material. A plasma dis-
charge is established inside the insert region, and electrons emitted from the insert surface are
accelerated through the cathode sheath that forms between the insert surface and the plasma.
The insert-region plasma must have sufficient density to support the emitted electron current density
from the insert and provide heating of the insert for the cathode to operate properly. The maximum
electron current density into the insert-region plasma is then determined by either space charge lim-
itations at the sheath edge or by characteristics of the surface (work function and temperature) that
limit the thermionic emission. As shown in Section 3.7.5 by the double sheath analysis, ions flowing
back from the plasma through the sheath to the cathode surface neutralize electron space charge and
increase the extracted electron current density from the insert surface. The electrons accelerated
through the sheath quickly give up their energy to the dense collisional plasma inside the insert. Elec-
trons in the tail of the Maxwellian distribution in this plasma have sufficient energy to ionize some
portion of the thruster propellant injected through the cathode, which is only a small fraction of the
total propellant injected into the thruster. Plasma electrons incident on the downstream end of the
cathode tube flow through the orifice and into the main discharge chamber.
The barium evaporated from dispenser cathode inserts is easily ionized in plasmas with this elec-
tron temperature because its ionization potential is only 5.2 eV. A calculation of the ionization
mean free path in NSTAR-sized hollow cathodes [42] predicts about 4 × 10−5 m, which is much
smaller than the interior dimensions of the cathode. The ionized barium then migrates upstream
from the ionization location because the potential gradient in the hollow cathode that pulls elec-
trons out of the cathode plasma also accelerates barium ions in the opposite direction (upstream).
This means that the barium released from the insert does not leave the cathode during discharge
operation, but tends to recycle in the plasma [43] and is deposited in the cooler upstream regions of
the hollow cathode.
The pressure inside the hollow cathode is set primarily by the gas flow rate through the cathode
and the orifice size, and must be sufficiently high to produce a collisional plasma. This condition is
required to slow the ions that are backstreaming from the orifice region and from the peak plasma
potential on axis (primarily by charge exchange) to avoid sputtering of the insert surface by high-
energy ion bombardment. Although this condition may not necessarily be satisfied everywhere
inside a Type C cathode (with no orifice), at least some fraction of the insert is protected by the
collisional processes for proper cathode operation and life. The collisional plasma will also tend
to have a low electron temperature, which reduces the sheath voltages and further protects the
low work function insert surface from damage or modification by the plasma.
4.4 Insert Region
85

The plasma inside the insert region is inherently 2-D and has strong coupling between the neutral
gas, plasma and sheath, which usually requires 2-D numerical simulations to solve for the density,
potential and temperature profiles. However, important insights can be obtained by using simple
particle and energy balance models and plasma diffusion models [44] to describe the plasma
because the transport inside the hollow cathode is dominated by collisions and the ion motion
is slow enough to neglect their inertia. In Chapter 3, the solution to the radial diffusion equation
for ions in collisionally dominated plasmas in cylindrical geometry resulted in an eigenvalue equa-
tion with a unique dependence on the electron temperature:
r
λ01
2
noσi Te
8kTe
πm −D = 0
4 4-1
where r is the internal radius of the insert, λ01 = 2.4048 is the first zero of the zero-order Bessel func-
tion, no is the neutral density, σi is the ionization cross section averaged over a Maxwellian electron
temperature and D is the diffusion coefficient. This means that the electron temperature is con-
strained to produce sufficient ions to offset the diffusion losses to the wall.
If we assume the diffusion in the radial direction in the insert region is ambipolar, and the ion
mobility is limited by resonant charge exchange (CEX) with the xenon neutral atoms, the average
collision frequency νi for the ions is then
νi = σCEXnoυscat
4 4-2
where the effective velocity υscat for scattering of the ions in the insert region is approximated by the
ion thermal speed:
υscat =

and Ti is the ion temperature in Kelvin. Since the electron mobility is much higher than the ion
mobility, the ambipolar diffusion coefficient Da from Eq. 3.6-58 for this case is then

4 4-4
where Di is the ion diffusion coefficient derived in Section 3.6.2 and the ion and electron tempera-
tures are given in units of eV. As an example, consider two hollow cathodes operating with xenon
and having different insert inner diameters. The neutral density inside the hollow cathode is
described by Eq. 2.7-1 for a given pressure P inside the cathode, which is determined by the
gas flow rate and the orifice size. A simple analytical technique to estimate the neutral pressure
in the insert region is given in Appendix B. Typical pressures inside discharge hollow cathodes
usually range from 1 to 15 Torr, although higher pressures are often found in neutralizer cath-
odes. Figure 4-12 shows the electron temperature versus internal pressure found from Eq. 4.4-1
for two insert diameters assuming a charge exchange cross section of 10−18 m2 [45] for low temper-
ature xenon ions and neutrals inside the hollow cathode and a neutral gas temperature of 2500 K. The
smaller NSTAR insert diameter requires a higher electron temperature to offset the higher diffusion
losses to the closer wall at a given pressure. During operation at the high power TH15 throttle point at
13.1 A and 3.7 sccm, the internal pressure was measured to be about 7.5 Torr and the predicted elec-
tron temperature was then about 1.36 eV. This agrees well with probe data taken in the insert region
[46] in this mode. The larger NEXIS cathode nominal discharge conditions of 25 A and 5.5 sccm
86

produce an internal pressure of 1.8 Torr, which results in a predicted electron temperature of about
1.4 eV that is also in good agreement with the measurements [46].

ode centerline by

In the example above, the larger diameter insert produces an electron temperature of about 1.4 eV
at 1.8 Torr internal xenon pressure. The effective ion velocity found near the wall is slowed by ion-
neutral CEX collisions to 3.1 m/s, which is significantly less than the 500 m/s ion thermal velocity
and 1200 m/s xenon ion acoustic velocity. Since the pre-sheath potential that accelerates the ions to
the Bohm velocity extends only the order of the collision mean free path into the plasma, ions dif-
fusing to the plasma edge are accelerated to the Bohm velocity very close to the sheath due to the
high collisionality in the insert-region plasma.
If the cathode has a Type B or C geometry, the density of the plasma in the insert region can be
estimated to within factors of about two of the true value by a simple 0-D particle and energy

balance model that assumes the plasma is uniform. In the insert region, heating of the plasma from
thermionic electrons that are accelerated through the cathode sheath and the resistive heating in
the plasma (terms on the left) is balanced by the power loss (terms on the right):

where It is the thermionically emitted electron current, ϕs is the cathode sheath voltage, R is the
insert-plasma resistance, Ie is the hollow cathode discharge current, Ii is the total ion current gen-
erated in the insert region, U+ is the ionization potential, TeV is the electron temperature (in volts),
and Ir is the random electron flux at the sheath edge. The power loss from the insert-region plasma
(the right-hand terms in Eq. 4.4-8) is the power it takes to make ions IiU+, the power convected out
of the plasma through the orifice 5
2 TeVIe, and the electron power loss due to tail electrons overcom-
ing the sheath to the wall. Ion excitation and radiation losses seen in the discharge chamber energy
balance equations in Chapter 5 are ignored because the high density plasma inside the hollow cath-
ode is optically “thick” and the radiated energy is reabsorbed by the plasma. The resistance R is the
resistivity times the average conduction length l divided by the cross sectional area of the insert-
region plasma:

tron current from the plasma:

Since the electron temperature is given by the solution to Eq. 4.4-1 in the insert region (as shown
above), Eq. 4.4-15 can be solved for the cathode sheath voltage as a function of the discharge current
if the radiation and conduction heat losses are known. The insert heat losses are found from thermal
models of the cathode, which will be discussed in Section 4.7. Eq. 4.4-15 can be greatly simplified by
realizing that in most cases TeV/2 << (U+ + ϕs), and the right-hand side is essentially equal to one.
Eq. 4.4-15 then reduces to a simple power balance equation, and the cathode sheath voltage is

Figure 4-13 shows the calculated sheath voltage from Eq. 4.4-16 for the NSTAR cathode at a
fixed 3.7 sccm xenon flow rate as a function of the discharge current for four values of the combined
radiated and conducted power loss. The electron temperature is taken to be 1.4 eV from Fig. 4-12 for
the 7.8 Torr measured at 13 A of discharge current and 3.7 sccm flow. A thermal model of this cath-
ode [47] to be described in Section 4.7 predicts that the total self-heating power available is about
40 W at 12 A of discharge current, resulting in a sheath voltage from the figure of only about 2 V. In
this case, over 20% of the random electron flux in the plasma can overcome the sheath voltage and
be collected on the insert to provide heating. The balance of the power required to heat the insert in
the NSTAR cathode comes from orifice plate heating [47], which will be discussed in Section 4.5.
In low-pressure Type B and C cathodes, the sheath potentials are much greater than the 3.6 V
calculated for the NSTAR discharge cathode. For example, in Fig. 4-12, the NSTAR solution for
the electron temperature is at the far right of the graph in excess of 7 Torr, whereas NEXIS and
other large orifice cathodes are closer to the left side of the graph between 1 and 2 Torr. The sheath
potential found by solving Eq. 4.4-16 for the NEXIS electron temperature is over 7 V, and so rela-
tively few plasma electrons return to the emitter and they do little heating. Most of the insert heat-
ing in lower pressure (on the order of 1–2 Torr), lower internal plasma density cathodes is from ion
bombardment of the insert surface due to the higher sheath voltage.
The insert-region plasma density can now be found from Eq. 4.4-8. The ion current term is given by
Ii = non e σiυe V,
4 4-17
where no is the neutral density, <σiυe> is the ionization reaction rate coefficient, V is the volume,
and n is the average plasma density over the insert volume. Remembering that the plasma density
in the random electron flux equation is evaluated at the plasma edge, Eq. 4.4-8 can be solved using
the above equations to produce an expression for the average plasma density:

4 Hollow Cathodes

density measurements made by a miniature scanning probe in this cathode [48] is obtained, and a
nearly linear dependence on discharge current is predicted by the model and shown experimen-
tally. While the idealized 0-D cathode model described above requires insert heat loss from a cath-
ode thermal model and on-axis potentials from probe measurements or 2-D simulations, it provides
reasonable agreement with the data and illustrates the dependence of the insert-region plasma den-
sity and temperature, on the geometry and the plasma conditions inside the cathode.
The 0-D model also illuminates the heating mechanism in the hollow cathode. The ion heating
power to the insert is found in Eq. 4.4-12:
Powerions = Ii U + + ϕs + TeV
2
−ϕwf
,
4 4-20
where the ion current is given by the Bohm current at the sheath edge. Using the above parameters
for the Type-B NSTAR discharge cathode shown in Fig. 4-5 at the full power TH15 operating point
of 13 A and 3.7 sccm (U+ = 12.1 eV, ϕs = 3.6 eV, Te = 1.36 eV, ϕwf = 2.06 V, ϕaxis = 8.5 V and an ion
density ni ≈1.5 × 1021m−3), the ion heating power from Eq. 4.4-20 is only 4.7 W. The electron heat-
ing power to the insert is also found in Eq. 4.4-12:
Powerelectrons = 2TeV + ϕwf Ire −ϕs TeV,
4 4-21
where the random electron current is again evaluated at the sheath edge. For the same example
parameters for Type B NSTAR cathode given above, the electron heating of the insert is found
to be about 45 W. This particular Type B cathode is, therefore, heated predominately by electron
heating of the insert, with a comparable amount coming from orifice heating (shown in
Section 4.7). Similar analysis of Type B cathodes with larger orifices or lower flow rates, and also
most Type C cathodes, indicates that ion heating will become the dominant heating mechanism
due to the higher electron temperature and larger sheath potential drop at the insert. More exten-
sive investigations of the power distributions and interior power characteristics of hollow cathodes
can be found in the literature [17, 18, 49].
It is important to recognize that as the pressure in the hollow cathode is increased, much of the
plasma heating comes from resistive heating of the current flowing through the partially ionized
plasma. The higher the neutral gas background pressure, the greater the contribution of resistive
heating. In cathodes with larger orifices that produce lower internal pressures, most of the heating
of the insert-region plasma comes from the emitted electrons that are accelerated across the cathode
sheath potential. In lower pressure cathodes, the sheath potential is higher and the plasma resis-
tivity is lower, resulting in less Joule heating of the plasma but more ion bombardment heating of
the insert surface. This is illustrated in Fig. 4-15, which shows the sheath potential and the ion and
electron currents impacting the cathode as a function of the resistive Joule heating of the plasma.
The behavior shown in Fig. 4-15 can be understood by rearranging the equations in the power
balance model above. Using Eqs. 3.7-29, 4.4-13 and 4.4-14 in the power balance equation (Eq. 4.4-8)
and solving for the sheath potential gives

The decrease in the sheath potential observed in Fig. 4-15 as the Joule heating (RIe
2) becomes more
significant follows directly from Eq. 4.4-22, because the Joule heating term enters with a negative
sign. Equation 4.4-13 also shows that a decrease in the sheath potential allows for more of the elec-
tron flux to return to the emitter. Finally, if the heat loss H(T) is fixed, Eq. 4.4-12 shows that the
increased return electron current (second term on the
4.4 Insert Region
91

reduced ion flux (first term on the right-hand side). This illustrates how the design and operating
conditions of the hollow cathode (sizes, flow, and discharge current) determine which terms dom-
inate in the cathode self-heating.
It is also possible to estimate the axial extent of the plasma in the insert region for Type A and
some Type B cathodes with small orifices that again produce diffusion dominated plasmas. This is
useful in understanding the plasma “attachment” or “contact length” with the insert, which
impacts where the electron emission can take place. As was shown in Chapter 3, the solution to
the 2-D diffusion equation in cylindrical geometry in Eq. 3.6-49 is the product of a zero order Bessel
function radially times an exponential term in the axial direction:
n r, z = n 0,0 Jo
C2 + α2r e −αz,
4 4-23
where z is the axial distance and α is one over the e-folding distance of the plasma density from
the reference location on axis at (0,0).This length can be found by considering the ion generation
inside the insert. The ion current to the insert surface is the ion generation rate integrated over
the volume inside the insert region:

For example, the axial plasma density profile from the scanning probe along the centerline inside
the NSTAR hollow cathode [46] operating at 15 A and 3.7 sccm is shown in Fig. 4-16. Taking the
peak plasma density from the figure of n(0,0) = 1.6 × 1021 m−3 as the reference density at position
(0,0) and using the neutral density calculated inside the insert from Eq. 2.7-2 of 2.5 × 1022 m−3,
Eq. 4.4-27 gives a value of α = 6.0 (corresponding to an e-folding length of 1/α = 1.7 mm) if the
ion current to the insert is 0.5 A. The fit to the exponential decrease in the plasma density upstream
of the orifice shown in Fig. 4-16 gives α = 6.1. The assumed value of 0.5 A for the ion current actually
results from a 2-D numerical model of the insert-region plasma that will be described later in this
section [12]. This simple diffusion model shows an exponential behavior in the axial plasma density
profile predicted from Eq. 4.4-23, which is consistent with the near-exponential profiles measured
in the NSTAR cathode sufficiently far away from the orifice region.
A closer examination of Eq. 4.4-27 shows that the terms on the right-hand side represent the ion-
ization rate per unit volume. If the geometry of the cathode is fixed, then the number of ions flowing
to the insert (Ii in the denominator) is proportional to this ionization rate per unit volume. There-
fore, the value of alpha will be constant for varying operating conditions of a given sized cathode.
This behavior is illustrated in Fig. 4-17, where the density profile for an NSTAR-size cathode with
two different orifice sizes operating at the same discharge current and gas flow is shown. For the
larger orifice cathode, the internal pressure at the constant gas flow is lower, and the penetration of
the 2-D effects associated with downstream boundary condition and the electron current funneling
into the orifice extends deeper into the insert region. In this case, the plasma is still collisional
enough to neglect the ion inertia terms in the momentum equation, but other properties of the
plasma, like the diffusion coefficient, electron temperature, and plasma density are no longer radi-
ally uniform. Therefore, a 2-D model that includes conservation equations for the neutral gas, elec-
tron energy, Ohm’s Law, and appropriate sheath boundary conditions is required to describe the

behavior in these cathode geometries. However, deep enough into the insert region from the orifice,
where 2-D effects have diminished and diffusion-limited plasma flow to the insert dominates, then
Eq. 4.4-23 is again valid and the value of alpha in the cathode is seen to be essentially constant.
It should be emphasized that the e-folding distance for the plasma density measured inside the
NSTAR cathode in Fig. 4-16 is 1/α = 1.7 mm. The plasma is only in significant contact with the
insert for a few e-foldings, which in this small orifice case is less than 1 cm. This rapid plasma den-
sity decrease away from the orifice is the result of the very high pressure in the NSTAR cathode
[12, 15] and also occurs in most neutralizer cathodes. For high pressure cathodes like this, utilizing
inserts significantly longer than 1–1.5 cm in length are not very useful because there is little plasma
left beyond this distance to accept the thermionic emission from the insert.
Althoughthe 0-D and 1-D models described above can provide somebasic insight intothe operation
of hollow cathodes, 2-D models that solve the extensive system of governing equations are the only
means to capture the spatial details of the plasma density in the insert region and near the cathode
orifice. The first 2-D model that solved such an extensive set of equations with appropriate sheath
boundary conditions is the 2-D Orifice Cathode (OrCa2D) code developed by Mikellides and Katz
in the mid-2000s. Early versions of this code included the insert but excluded the cathode orifice
[12, 50], which meant that boundary conditions at the entrance to the orifice had to be prescribed.
This was no longer necessary in later versions of the code that included the orifice and keeper regions,
and a sufficiently large plume region to allow simulation of different anode configurations.
The insert-region plasma energy balance in OrCa2D was derived in [12] based on the individual
electron and ion energy conservation equations. These equations were also described in Section
3.5.3 of Chapter 3. Neglecting the energy terms associated with the thermal non-equilibrium
between electrons and the heavy species, the steady-state electron energy equation can be written:

where Ji is the ion current density, κn is the thermal conductivity for neutrals, and it is assumed that
the ions and neutrals are in thermal equilibrium (Tn = Ti) in the collisional insert-region plasma.
The energy balance equations are used to close the system of equations describing the plasma in
the insert region. These equations also are used to describe the self-heating mechanism character-
istic of hollow cathodes due to the particle flux and energy hitting the cathode walls. This effect will
be discussed in Sections 4.5 and 4.7 with respect to the cathode thermal models.
Writing the steady-state momentum equations from Eq. 3.5-5 for the ions and electrons (neglect-
ing the inertia terms):

This system of equations was solved numerically in OrCa2D [12] to determine the plasma density,
temperature, and potential in the insert region for the NSTAR discharge cathode operating condi-
tions of 12 A and 4.25 sccm. Utilizing thermionic emission from the insert surface described by
Eq. 4.3-4 with temperatures measured by Polk [51], and applying the proper boundary conditions
at the wall and the entrance to the orifice, the plasma density profile along the axis of symmetry is
compared with the laboratory measurement in Fig. 4-18. The 12 A net cathode current was found to
result from almost 32 A electron emission by the insert countered by 20 A of plasma (thermal) elec-
tron current back to the insert and the orifice plate. The particle balance in the insert is shown in
Table 4-2, where only about 0.5 A of the net cathode current is due to ionization of the xenon gas,
which was used in the previous analysis to obtain the exponential density scale lengths.
4.4 Insert Region
95

OrCa2D describes accurately what is happening in the cathode insert region. For example, the
numerical results in Table 4-2 capture the 2-D effects upstream of the cathode orifice as shown in
Fig. 4-19, predicting a density profile that is consistent with the data [17]. The code’s predictions of
the electron temperature and plasma potential are also close to the measured values in the emission
zone, which extends less than about 0.5 cm upstream of the orifice entrance in the NSTAR cathode.
The plasma density contours plotted in Fig. 4-19a show that the density falls radially as expected
toward the insert wall. The 2-D plasma potential contours for this case are also shown in Fig. 4-19b.
Good agreement with the measurements has been achieved by the code for larger cathodes as well,
such as with the 1.5-cm diameter NEXIS cathode [11, 12], and at different operating conditions
[15, 17, 52–56] spanning all three types of cathodes in Fig. 4-5.
The 2-D numerical simulations have revealed critical insights about the main drivers behind the
internal plasma density profiles. The final state of the plasma inside the cathode depends primarily
on two competing characteristic penetration depths: Ln, which is associated with the penetration of
the neutral gas from the cathode inlet into the ionization region and, Lj, the penetration depth of the
electron current density from the orifice to the cathode interior. The former can be simply estimated
as Ln

frequency of the neutrals. Hence, any process that increases the velocity of the neutrals, such as
increasing the flow rate in a given cathode geometry or decreasing the emitter I.D. at a given flow
rate, will also increase the penetration of neutrals into the ionization region, thereby reducing that
region’s characteristic scale size. This will lead also to higher internal pressure and a steeper plasma
density gradient upstream of the peak plasma density value. An example of this trend is shown in
Fig. 4-20 in a cathode where only the mass flow rate was changed for two different insert diameters.
One can show from the electron and neutral continuity equations that Lj Id/DEJE where DE is the
emitter I.D. and Id is the discharge current. The quantity JE, represents the net current density of
electrons the emitter must provide to support Id. The value of JE is determined by the difference
between the flux of electrons that are thermionically emitted and those that are generated in
the plasma and have sufficient energy to overcome the sheath potential and return back to the emit-
ter. As we discussed in Section 4.3, the flux of emitted electrons depends on the temperature of the

emitter which is driven by the plasma heat loads generated during operation and the properties of
the cathode’s thermal system, as described in Section 4.7. The flux of return electrons depends on
the thermal flux of electrons toward the insert and the potential difference across the sheath that
forms along the emitter.
It is through these two main processes that the cathode regulates the electron supply to the dis-
charge. Therefore, though Lj appears to have a deceivingly simple dependence on Id and JE, it is in
factmuchmore difficult todiscern thanLn.Inadditiontothe complexitiesassociatedwiththe thermal
balance and plasma loads that ultimately determine the temperature at which the emitter will oper-
ate, the sheath drop at the emitter is dependent on the electric field that develops inside the cathode,
which can only be determined by Ohm’s law given by Eq. 4.4-36 and the appropriate boundary con-
ditions.For simplicityEq. 4.4-36includesonlythe two dominant terms onthe right-hand side, namely
the resistive and the electron pressure gradient contributions to the electric field E:

Here, ηei and ηen are the resistivities due to electron-ion (e-i) and electron-neutral (e-n) collisions,
and pe and ne are electron pressure and number density, respectively.
Numerical simulations have shown that in the ionization region of most of these cathodes, the
resistivity is largely because of electron-ion collisions and is therefore insensitive to changes in both
the plasma and neutral gas densities. A typical comparison of the centerline electron-ion and elec-
tron-neutral resistivities determined by 2-D numerical simulations of a Type B discharge cathode
operating at 25 A [55] is shown in Fig. 4-21. Also shown on the plot for reference are the neutral gas
and electron number densities. This insensitivity of the electron-ion resistivity implies that the only
means of regulating the current density in the ionization region is through the pressure gradient,

potential drop from the orifice to the emitter, the thermionic emission, and the features of the den-
sity profiles observed in measurements like those in Figs. 4-6, 4-8 and 4-20 are largely the response
of the plasma to Ohm’s law through the pressure gradient.
To further elaborate on what takes place in this region we use the following example. Consider
any process that increases the thermionic emission flux of electrons at fixed discharge current and
mass flow rate; say, by using a shorter emitter or an external heat source that raises the emitter
temperature. Because the discharge current is fixed by the external power supply, the return elec-
tron current to the emitter must increase to produce the correct net current, which requires a lower
sheath drop at the emitter and therefore a lower electric potential in the plasma region. This
increases the electric field which would, in turn, also lead to an increase in the electron current
density and ultimately a higher Id. To counter that increase, the electron pressure must increase,
which leads to a smaller density gradient length scale, L∇n ≡(∇n/n)−1. This, of course, does not
happen without also affecting Ln which must increase since a lower upstream plasma density
increases the penetration of neutrals into the ionization region and, in turn, the interior pressure.
The density profile trends shown in Fig. 4-8, which are for a cathode in which the discharge cur-
rent is changed, can be explained along these same lines, although in this case the only parameter
increasing is Id. Nevertheless, higher Id in general still increases the emitter heating and lowers the
sheath potential, which again leads to a smaller L∇n. Moreover, because the emitter is warmer at
higher discharge currents, ions that are neutralized at the surface and return back to the plasma as
neutrals are also warmer, which increases the interior pressure. Finally, higher peak plasma den-
sities mean increased heating rates for the heavy species through charge-exchange collisions; this
also increases the interior pressure.

4.4 Insert Region

4.5
Orifice Region
Electrons are extracted from the insert-region plasma through the cathode orifice into the discharge
chamber or ion beam. For cathodes with no orifice, a transition region exists at the end of the insert
and cathode tube where the neutral gas density is sufficiently low and the flow becomes collision-
less. Orificed cathodes, in most cases, also have a transition region to collisionless neutral flow,
which can occur inside the orifice or slightly downstream depending on the orifice size and the
gas flow rate. Inside the orifice, the electron current density is the highest in the entire system.
In this region, classical electron scattering with the ions and neutral gas produces resistive heating.
The hot electrons then ionize a large fraction of the xenon gas, most of which strike the orifice wall
as ions and heat it. The amount of orifice-plasma resistance and orifice plate heating depends on the
geometry, flow rate, and discharge current. Type A cathodes have long, narrow orifices and high
pressures, which lead to high resistivity, strong ion bombardment of the orifice wall, and significant
local heating. Type B cathodes tend to have smaller orifice heating unless the orifice is relatively small
and the gas flow high, both because the resistance is usually lower than in Type A cathodes and
because a larger fraction of the power deposited in the plasma in this region convects out into the
cathode plume. For example, the 1-mm diameter orifice NSTAR cathode has significant orifice heat-
ing, but the 2.5 mm diameter orifice NEXIS cathode has lower orifice heating even at higher currents.
Under typical conditions that Type A and B cathodes are operated in electric propulsion, the ion
flow in the cylindrical region of the orifice can be assumed to be diffusion limited. Their low flow
speed and short mean free paths for charge exchange collisions with the neutrals mean that ions
in this region do not move very far in a collision time. For example, the NSTAR discharge
cathode operating in the TH15 mode has an average neutral density in the orifice region of
no ≈5 × 1021 m−3. The average ion mean-free-path for resonant charge exchange collisions with
a cross section of
10−18 m2 is
λ =

σCEXno
≈2 × 10−4m,

which is about 5 times smaller than the orifice diameter. Thus, diffusion is a good approximation for
the ion motion in these hollow cathode orifices. This is in fact true for a wide range of cathode
geometries and operating conditions and was confirmed by 2-D numerical simulations with
OrCa2D after the ion momentum equation was updated in the code to include the ion inertia terms
∂(nvi)/∂t + ∇(nvivi). For example, Fig. 4-22 shows a comparison of the electron number density
with (top) and without (bottom) the ion inertia terms, for a LaB6 cathode operating at 100 A [56]. It
is clear that the differences in the two solutions are quite small in the orifice and insert regions, but
become larger in the cathode plume where ions attain larger speeds and their density, as well as that
of neutrals, decline.
We can take advantage of these properties in the orifice to construct a 0-D model of the cathode
orifice plasma to show the dependence of the plasma density, electron temperature, and voltage
drop in the orifice region. However, such a model provides only a rough estimate of these para-
meters because there is a large neutral pressure gradient generated going toward the orifice,
whereas the model uses average parameters. It is assumed for now that the orifice is long compared
to its length so that the radial ion diffusion equation applies. The solution to this equation for col-
lisional plasmas in the orifice, described above for the insert region, results in the usual eigenvalue
equation dependent on the electron temperature:

where ro is now the internal radius of the orifice. The electron temperature is again constrained to
produce sufficient ions to offset the diffusion losses, as in the insert region analysis. Eq. 4.5-2 can be
solved for the local electron temperature in the orifice using the terms evaluated in Eq. 4.4-4
through Eq. 4.4-7.
The steady-state electron energy equation (Eq. 4.4-28) is integrated over the cylindrical orifice,
ignoring thermal conduction and radiation losses, to yield an equation for the average plasma den-
sity in the orifice. In this case, ohmic heating in the orifice plasma is balanced by convection of the
energy deposited in the orifice plasma electrons and ionization losses:

Te
in, is the electron temperature in the insert-region plasma that comes from another model such as
the diffusion model used in Section 4.4, or from experimental measurements.
The detailed measurements of the plasma density and electron temperature in the orifice of the
NSTAR discharge cathode [48] will be used as a first example to compare with the model predic-
tions. The NSTAR discharge cathode has an orifice diameter of 0.1 cm, and the case of the full
power TH15 operating point with 13 A of discharge current at a xenon gas flow rate of 3.7 sccm
will be used. The pressure measured inside the insert region for this case is about 7.8 Torr [48].
Assuming a fully developed viscous (Poiseuille) flow (see Appendix B), the pressure in the orifice
is estimated to fall to less than 3 Torr by the end of the 0.75 mm long cylindrical section of the
orifice. Assuming a gas temperature of about 2000 K in the orifice, the solution for the electron
temperature in the diffusion equation (Eq. 4.5-2) versus pressure in the orifice is shown in
Fig. 4-23. The electron temperature predicted by this model varies by less than 1 eV along the orifice
length, and the average in the channel is about 2.3 eV. This value is close to the experimentally
measured values of 2.2–2.3 eV found in this region [46].
Using this electron temperature, the density in the orifice is calculated from Eq. 4.5-4 and plotted
in Fig. 4-24 versus the discharge current for the NSTAR cathode. The agreement with the exper-
imental data [48] taken for two discharge currents at the nominal 3.7 sccm cathode flow rate is also
very good. The resistance calculated from Eq. 4.4-9 for the cylindrical orifice length is 0.31 Ω which,
at 13 A, produces a voltage drop in the orifice of about 4 V. This is the same magnitude as the voltage
change observed in the experimental data, which illustrates that the potential drop in the hollow
cathode orifice is resistive due to the very collisional plasma that exists there in these xenon hollow
cathodes. Detailed 2-D calculations described below indicate that roughly half of the power depos-
ited in this region (P = 4 V × 13A = 52 W) goes to the orifice wall, and the remainder is convected
into the discharge chamber by the plasma.
Since the 0-D orifice model with just the average parameters has been shown to provide rough
estimates of the orifice parameters, it is reasonable to use it to examine Type A cathode orifice heat-
ing. Consider the orifice of the NSTAR neutralizer cathode [48], which has an inside-diameter of
0.028 cm. The pressure measured inside the neutralizer during operation at 3.2 A, associated with

the full power TH15 case, is 145 Torr. Assuming again simple Poiseuille flow (see Appendix B)
through the 3 : 1 aspect ratio orifice channel in this cathode, the pressure is found to fall to less than
20 Torr by the end of the 0.75 mm long cylindrical section of the orifice. Assuming the same gas
temperature of about 2000 K in the orifice again, the solution to the radial diffusion Eq. 4.5-2 pre-
dicts the electron temperature to vary by only 0.5 eV along the orifice, with an average value of
about 1.4 eV. It is also assumed that a minimal 1 eV electron temperature exists in the insert region
for the Te
in in Eq. 4.5-3.
The average plasma density in the orifice is plotted in Fig. 4-25 versus the discharge current. At
3.2 A, corresponding to the neutralizer cathode producing the beam current of 1.76 A plus the
keeper current of 1.5 A, the predicted plasma density is about 6 × 1022 m−3. The resistance calcu-
lated from Eq. 4.4-9 for the cylindrical orifice section is 3.5 Ω, which, at 3.2 A, produces a resistive
voltage drop in the orifice of about 11 V. The power deposited in the plasma (P = 11 V × 3.2A =
35 W) in this case goes primarily to the orifice wall because the convection power loss is low
due to the large geometrical aspect ratio of Type A orifices and the low electron temperature. This
demonstrates the resistive orifice heating power characteristically found in Type A cathodes.
Although 0-D models are useful to illustrate the strong resistive effects in the orifices of all Type
A and some Type B cathodes, the use of average pressures and temperatures reduces the accuracy of
these models. However, it is possible to construct a 1-D model for the cathode orifice [44] to address
this issue. The orifice plate is usually chamfered on the downstream side, which must be included in
the analysis because the rapidly expanding gas plume in this region often transitions to the colli-
sionless regime in which the flow is not dominated by diffusion.
In the orifice, continuity dictates that the ions that hit the orifice wall are re-emitted as neutrals
and re-enter the plasma. The continuity equations for the three species (neutrals, ions, and elec-
trons) in the cylindrically symmetric orifice region are, respectively:

has been observed in experiments and in 2-D numerical simulations (shown later) where the neu-
tral temperatures are higher than the orifice wall temperatures.
Combining the electron and ion momentum equations (Eq. 4.4-30 and Eq. 4.4-31) to eliminate

The ambipolar diffusion coefficient for this case is given by Eq. 4.4-4. In the orifice, the radial drift

where υr is the radial ion velocity found from Eq. 4.4-7.
The continuity equations in the orifice (Eqs. 4.5-5 through 4.5-7) were solved using the electron
energy Eq. 4.4-28 and Ohm’s Law in the cylindrical orifice to produce ion density and plasma poten-
tial profiles in the orifice region. The first result from this work is that a double sheath often pos-
tulated in the orifice region [58] is not observed for xenon ion thruster cathodes. There is a potential
gradient through the orifice, but this results from resistive effects associated with classical electron
collisions in the orifice channel and is not due to any double layer inside the orifice channel.
As an example, Fig. 4-26 shows a plot of the neutral and plasma density along the axis of an
NSTAR neutralizer cathode orifice operating at the TH15 power point, producing 3.76 A of current
with a xenon gas flow rate of 3.5 sccm. The peak plasma density occurs in the cylindrical section of
the orifice, and the density falls though the chamfered region because of the neutral gas density
decrease. It should be noted that the peak plasma density predicted by the 1-D model in the orifice
is in reasonable agreement with the 0-D model results shown above that used the average neutral
density and temperature along the length of the orifice. When the assumptions remain valid and

using inputs from other models or measurements, reasonably accurate results can be obtained
using simple 0-D and 1-D models to illustrate the driving physics in this region.
An interesting result of this simplified analysis is that significant ionization occurs in the orifice,
which provides electrons to the discharge. Figure 4-27 shows the electron current calculated as a
function of the distance along the orifice axis. The electron current is about 50% higher exiting the
orifice compared to the amount extracted from the insert-region plasma. This is because the very
high neutral gas density in the neutralizer cathode orifice region causes significant ionization. Dis-
charge cathodes have much lower electron multiplication factors in the orifice because the neutral
and plasma densities are typically an order of magnitude lower.
The ion current density to the orifice wall, which naturally follows the plasma density profile in
Fig. 4-26, is shown in Fig. 4-28. The ion bombardment of the orifice walls is seen to peak well before
the chamfer region starts. Since the plasma potential is increasing along the axis from the insert-
region plasma to the exit due to the plasma resistance, the ions in this region can have sufficient
energy to sputter the wall. This effect was observed in the cross section of the NSTAR neutralizer
after the 8200 Life Demonstration Test (LDT) [59] and is shown in Fig. 4-29. The orifice was
observed to open up in the center cylindrical region before the chamfer, consistent with the pre-
dicted ion bombardment location in Fig. 4-28.
The time required to produce this erosion pattern is not known from the experiments because
Fig. 4-29 shows a destructive analysis after the end of the test. In fact, the erosion pattern shown
in the destructive analysis of the neutralizer cathode orifice after the 30,352 h Extended Life Test
(ELT) [60] shown in Fig. 4-30 is nearly identical to the shorter duration LDT result. The ELT cath-
ode experienced nearly double the operation time of the LDT cathode at the full power level, which
did not further erode the orifice. The 1-D orifice model described above shows that the neutral pres-
sure and plasma density in the orifice decrease as the diameter increases, which reduces the ion
bombardment flux but cannot capture the plasma potential changes that occur along the channel.
Considering the low ion energies that are generated in this region of the cathode, the sputtering

yield and, therefore, the erosion rate, can be very
strongly dependent on the sheath drop so its accu-
rate determination is of utmost importance.
Explanations for this behavior and quantitative
predictions of the erosion rates were provided by
detailed numerical simulations using OrCa2D
[53]. The numerical simulations showed that the
main mechanism responsible for the channel ero-
sion was sputtering by singly-charged ions. These
ions were accelerated by the sheath along the
channel and bombarded the surface with suffi-
cient kinetic energy to erode the walls at the begin-
ning of the test. The density of the ions inside
the neutralizer orifice was found to be as high as
2 × 1022 m−3. As the orifice channel opened due
to the erosion, the plasma potential, and in turn
the energy of the ions bombarding the orifice walls
through the sheath, diminished. The maximum
energy/charge with which Xe+ bombarded the orifice walls at the beginning of the test was found
to be about 17 V, as shown in the plasma potential contours of Fig. 4-31 (top). By the time the chan-
nel opened to a radius of 0.023 cm, the maximum ion energy had fallen below 9 V corresponding to
almost a three-order-of-magnitude drop in the sputtering yield. At such low yields the erosion of the
orifice material is negligible and the sputtering essentially stopped.
The potential contours from the numerical simulations of the eroded channel after 500 h of oper-
ation are shown in Fig. 4-31 (bottom). The results predicted that more than half of the erosion
occurred in less than 1000 h, and that the erosion became negligible in less than a few thousand
hours. A comparison of the final state of the eroded orifice from the simulations is compared with

the measurement in Fig. 4-32. Modeling capabilities of this kind are critical in the design and life
qualification of hollow cathodes for electric propulsion where, in the absence of long and costly
wear tests, these are the only means of evaluating the life of these neutralizers since the size of their
orifices prohibit access to probe diagnostics.
One might expect similar erosion behavior from discharge cathode orifices. Figure 4-33 shows the
destructive analysis of the LDT discharge cathode orifice plate after 8200 h at full power where there
is no discernable erosion in the cross section. The OrCa2D simulations showed quantitatively that
due to the 3.5× larger diameter of the discharge cathode orifice, the resistive drop and resistive heat-
ing, which largely drive the plasma potential, electron heating and ionization inside the orifice,
were both much higher in the neutralizer orifice. The plasma density inside the orifice of the dis-
charge cathode was more than 40× lower, as shown in Fig. 4-34, and the sheath drop 7 V lower
compared to the values in the neutralizer. At these conditions, singly charged xenon ions could
cause no significant sputtering of the surface.

beam plasma. In this region, the neutral gas expands rapidly away from the cathode and is either
collisionless from the cathode orifice region or makes the transition to collisionless near the keeper.
The electrons from the cathode are accelerated by the potential difference between the cathode ori-
fice plasma and the plasma in the near cathode plume. The total potential difference is usually near
the discharge chamber anode voltage in ion thrusters or the beam plasma potential in Hall thrus-
ters. There is usually an applied axial magnetic field on the order of 100 G in the near cathode plume
region of the discharge cathode in DC ion thrusters and at the hollow cathode exit region in Hall
thrusters with center-mounted cathodes. In ion thrusters this field provides a transition to the ring-
cusp fields, which produces some confinement of the cathode plume electrons which generate the
cathode plume plasma. In Hall thrusters with centrally mounted cathodes, this field is generated at
the central pole face due to the magnetic field design to produce the radial field of the thruster near
the channel exit.
The plasma stream exiting the hollow cathode is often reported as having various structures con-
sisting of dark spaces, plasma spheres, and brightly divergent plume shapes. Two common cases are
shown in Fig. 4-35, where in each photo the cathode is on the right and the anode on the left. The
plasma stream consists of the electrons from the hollow cathode, neutral gas expanding from
the keeper aperture in addition to more uniform background neutral gas from the thruster, and
the plasma plume generated by ionization of this gas by the electrons. The on-axis potential and
temperature profiles measured by scanning probes for these two cases [11] are shown in Fig. 4-36.
Although the discharge current is the same in these two cases, the high gas flow reduced the discharge
voltage from about 26 V at 5.5 sccm to 20 V at 10 sccm. The structure of the potential and temperature
profiles is significantly different in the plume region as the gas flow and discharge voltage change.
The higher gas flow case reduces the potentials and temperatures throughout the system and pushes
the plasma sphere observed at the cathode exit farther downstream. The flat potential region just
downstream of the cathode orifice exit is related to the keeper orifice location, and higher gas flows
pushes this potential structure even further downstream into the plume.
If the processes described above were not complex enough, the electrons from the cathode are
extracted at high enough velocities and low densities that electrostatic instabilities can also be gen-
erated in this region of the cathode. The topic of instabilities will be discussed further in this

section and in Section 4.10. The combination of all these processes makes this region of the cathode
unamenable to idealized modeling in 0-D or 1-D. Comprehensive 2-D models and numerical simu-
lations coupled with experimental measurements to validate the results appears to be the only
means by which the complexity of these plumes can be resolved and thoroughly analyzed.
The 2-D structure of the cathode plume as it expands from the cathode orifice has been investi-
gated experimentally by several authors [46, 48, 61]. Figure 4-37 shows plasma density contours
measured [62] with a fast scanning Langmuir probe. The density is the highest on-axis and closest
to the cathode orifice, which is consistent with the visual appearance of a bright plasma sphere or
spot at the cathode exit that expands both radially and axially into the discharge chamber [46].
A reduction in cathode gas flow causes the sphere or spot to pull back toward the cathode orifice
and the plasma to expand into what is called a plume mode [4, 10, 63]. Plume mode operation gen-
erally results in high frequency oscillations in the cathode plume that propagate into the discharge
chamber and keeper region, and can couple to the power supply connection leads if of sufficient
amplitude.
The plasma potential contours measured by the scanning probe for the case of Fig. 4-37 are shown
in Fig. 4-38. The potential is actually a minimum on axis near the cathode, and then increases radi-
ally and axially away from the cathode exit to a value several volts in excess of the discharge voltage
[46, 62]. This structure near the cathode is sometimes called a “trough” because ions generated
externally to the cathode tend to funnel into the trough and toward the cathode. Large amplitude
plasma potential oscillations (20–80 V) in the range of 50–1000 kHz have been observed primarily
in and around the edge of the plasma sphere and in front of the keeper electrode from high speed
scanning emissive probes [64, 65].
The abundance of physical processes that take place in the plume region of the hollow cathode
also called for extensive 2-D numerical modeling to explain the physics and plasma behavior. Early
attempts were made to develop 2-D models of the plasma discharge [66, 67], but in general these
models did not account for all the pertinent physics that were later found to be important and/or

only encompassed portions of the cathode-plume domain [12, 68]. The first 2-D model to success-
fully solve an extensive system of governing laws for the cathode discharge, using numerical sim-
ulation and a computational domain that spanned all regions of the hollow cathode, namely the
insert, cathode and keeper orifices, and the plume region, was the OrCa2D code [56]. The system
of governing laws solved in this code is based on Braginskii’s formulations for partially ionized
gases [69] subject to appropriate sheath boundary conditions in the presence of thermionic emis-
sion [70]. The system also includes the Navier–Stokes equations for the neutral gas since viscosity
was found to be important in the insert region [71]. The neutral gas model is smoothly transitioned
from the continuum regime in the insert region to the collisionless regime in the plume. This tran-
sition typically occurs inside the cathode plate orifice.
One of the first significant findings from the global OrCa2D simulations was on plasma instabil-
ities. The first efforts to model the plume with OrCa2D revealed that the electron resistivity due to
classical collisions was orders of magnitude too low to explain the measured plasma parameter pro-
files. Mikellides [72] postulated that the presence of anomalous resistivity in the plume of a 25-A
hollow cathode was required to explain the measured plasma potential and electron temperature
profiles. It was also shown [12] that the conditions for the growth of the ion acoustic instability were
met near the orifice and that this could saturate to ion acoustic turbulence (IAT) [73–75] down-
stream in the plume. When an idealized anomalous resistivity model for the electrons subjected
to IAT was included, the agreement with the measurements near the orifice improved significantly.
Ultimately, in the global version of OrCa2D the anomalous contribution to the generalized Ohm’s
law was incorporated through the addition of an anomalous collision frequency, να, yielding a total
resistivity η as follows:
η = m νe + να
e2n
4 6-1
where νe represents the classical electron-ion and electron-atom collision frequencies.
Figure 4-39 top compares measurements of the plasma potential on the centerline of the NSTAR
discharge hollow cathode with the computed values produced by the model of να used in the
simulations, and with a version of the model that yielded one order of magnitude lower total col-
lision frequency [54]. A steady state solution could not be obtained with classical resistivity alone
(να = 0). The comparison of the classical and anomalous collisions frequencies in those simulations
in Fig. 4-39 bottom shows that the anomalous collision frequency can be approximately two orders
of magnitude larger than the classical collision frequency in the plume region, and that the differ-
ence diminishes as the cathode is approached.
The idealized IAT model of the resistivity was based on the formulations of Sagdeev and Galeev
[75], who assumed the IAT saturates through non-linear wave-particle interactions. This allowed
them to determine the turbulent wave energy WT and reduce the “anomalous” collision frequency
να to a simple algebraic function of the macroscopic plasma parameters as follows:
να
ωpe
W T
nTe
= β ωpe
Te
Ti
υe
υth
4 6-2
where the electron drift speed is υe, the electron thermal speed is υth = (2 kTe/m)½, and the electron
plasma frequency is ωpe. Several years after the original formulations of Sagdeev and Galeev in
1969, the coefficient β was found to be approximately 0.01 [76]. In most early simulations with
OrCa2D that used the Sagdeev and Galeev model [54], the heavy species were assumed to be in
thermal equilibrium. Therefore, a separate ion energy equation was not solved. Consequently,
the ratio Te/Ti in Eq. 4.6-2 was assumed to be constant. This ratio was then included in a coefficient
β such that να = β ωpeυe/υTe, which was determined in the simulations by iteration based on the
114

specified discharge current. In the electron energy equation, anomalous heating of electrons is
taken into account through the frictional heat exchange [55]. The IAT-based collision frequency
in Eq. 4.6-2 led to results that agreed well with experimentally-measured plasma parameters along
the centerlines of two discharge cathodes [54, 72] operating with discharge currents in the range of
13.3–27.5 A. Later, in an effort that combined numerical modeling and plasma measurements in a
LaB6 25-A cathode, the simulations actually allowed for the determination of the coefficient β in
Eq. 4.6-2. This was made possible by the fact that more parameters about the experiment were
known in these simulations than in most previous cases where β was treated as a free parameter.
It was found that β was only about a factor of two lower than the estimated theoretical value of
0.01 [55].
It was argued that because anomalous heating of ions was not accounted for in the simulations,
the computed ion temperatures were lower than those in the discharge, yielding a higher value of
the electron-to-ion temperature and, in turn, a somewhat lower value for β. This result was nev-
ertheless notable because it was the first time that an electric propulsion hollow cathode was used
to determine the value of β through a combination of simulations and measurements. The confir-
mation of β
0.01 also strengthened the theoretical predictions of IAT-driven anomalous resistivity

in these devices when operating at tens of amperes. The application of Eq. 4.6-2 to higher discharge
currents ( 100 A), however, yielded only qualitative agreement with the experiments. This sug-
gested that a more sophisticated closure relation was needed for the IAT-driven anomalous colli-
sion frequency in high-current cathodes, like that proposed by Lopez Ortega [77] who solved an
additional conservation equation for the IAT wave energy density WT in the OrCa2D global system
of equations for the plasma.
The presence of IAT in the near-plume of hollow cathodes was confirmed several years later
experimentally by Jorns [78] in a high-current LaB6 hollow cathode operating over the range of
20–130 A. The authors, through direct measurements with scanning probes, confirmed that anom-
alous resistivity from the IAT dominates over classical values over a wide range of operating con-
ditions, but most notably at high current to gas flow ratios. Most revealing were the measurements
that allowed the authors to generate the Beall intensity plot in Figure 4-40 showing the dispersion of
the waves 0.75 cm from the keeper face. The dispersion clearly exhibits a linear dependence
between the frequency (ω) and the wave number (k) which strongly supports the presence of
the ion acoustic instability. This conclusion was strengthened by measurements of the wave phase
velocity, which the authors determined by fitting a line to the dispersion plot as shown in Fig. 4-40.
They also determined directly from the measurements the anomalous collision frequency and com-
pared it to the classical electron-ion values. The results are plotted in Fig. 4-41 and show that there
are a number of operating conditions – most notably high current to flow ratios – where the anom-
alous collision frequency is dominant over classical values.
The theoretical predictions by Mikellides of anomalous resistivity due to IAT in the hollow cath-
ode plume, and the experimental confirmation by Jorns of the presence there of IAT, established
this as a dominant non-classical process that is fundamental to the operation of most hollow cath-
odes used in electric propulsion. The presence of IAT in these devices has implications not only on
the electrons, but also on the heating of the ions that possibly produces erosion of the keeper. All
these topics comprise an active area of research.

4 Hollow Cathodes

4.7
Heating and Thermal Models
Hollow cathodes must be heated to thermionic temperatures to start emission and the plasma dis-
charge. The heater is usually made of a refractory metal wire such as tantalum that is electrically
insulated from the cathode tube by a ceramic structure. This structure can be in the form of a coaxial
sheathed heater, a thin film heater on a ceramic substrate around the cathode, or a heater wire laid
into a spiral or bifilar wound slot in a ceramic part placed around the cathode.
4.7.1
Hollow Cathode Heaters
Barium oxide dispenser hollow cathodes manufactured in the United States typically use a coiled
coaxial tantalum sheathed heater [79, 80] that features a magnesium oxide powder insulation. This
swaged heater geometry is common in industrial furnaces and can be found in the standard catalog
of several companies. For space applications the tantalum heaters have been developed with var-
ious sizes and lengths to provide power levels of tens of watts to over 100 W. The MgO insulation
material has a maximum operation temperature of about 1400 C, above which chemical reactions
between the oxide insulation and the heater electrode or sheath material cause a reduction in the
resistance and ultimately lead to failure of the heater [80]. These heaters have demonstrated thou-
sands of hours of on-time and over 10,000 on/off cycles in qualification tests for flight of BaO-W
dispenser hollow cathodes [79].
Lanthanum hexaboride hollow cathodes typically need more heater power than a conventional
BaO-W dispenser cathode and the capability to go to higher temperatures to achieve the temperatures
associated with the higher work function of LaB6. A tantalum sheathed heater that incorporates high-
temperature alumina powder insulation was developed [37, 81] and has been used to heat LaB6 hol-
low cathodes of many different sizes. The powdered alumina insulation has a maximum temperature
of about 1800 C, which is well in excess of the temperature required to start the LaB6 cathode.
A 0.24 cm-dia. sheathed Al2O3-insulated tantalum heater routinely provides 120 W of heater
power for the 0.63-cm-dia. LaB6 cathode [81], which has accumulated over 1000 starts to date. This
same size sheathed heater is used for a 1.5-cm dia. LaB6 cathode [19, 37], which has a 50% longer

length before winding than used in the smaller cathode to provide 280 W of heater power. A 2-cm
dia. LaB6 cathode [82, 83] typically uses 380 W of heater power from two of the sheathed heaters
wound in parallel around the cathode tube, as seen in Fig. 4-42 left, to heat and ignite the larger
cathode. Also seen in Fig. 4-42 right is the tantalum foil heat shield wound around the heater to
reduce radiation losses from the cathode.
An alternative heater configuration consists of a filament wound in a ceramic mandrel placed
around the cathode tube [84].Figure 4-43 shows several views of such a filament heater in a single
coil or bifilar wound configuration. A cylindrical ceramic sheath is also normally slid over the
heater filament assembly to insulate the filament from the layers of refractory metal foil heat shield-
ing wound around the outside of the heater assembly to reduce the radiation losses out of the
cathode.
4.7.2
Heaterless Hollow Cathodes
While all of the flight cathodes built to date have used an external heater, this heater is subject to
failures associated with insulation breakdown, filament opening/shorting, and the electrical con-
nection opening. To avoid these problems, heaterless ignition has been pursued where a Paschen

discharge [1] is initiated between the cathode orifice plate or insert and the keeper electrode to pro-
vide the heat required to bring the emitter up to emission temperatures. The very first hollow cath-
odes that used straight refractory-metal tubes utilized a high voltage ignitor pulse to start a
Paschen/arc discharge to heat the end of the cathode tube and ignite the cathode [2]. Called “hea-
terless hollow cathodes”, this technology has been the subject of many development programs and
a review by Lev et al. [85] summarized the progress with heaterless cathodes worldwide until 2019.
Heaterless hollow cathode ignition [86] can be divided into three phases: (i) initial electrical
breakdown of the keeper discharge, (ii) heating of the cathode, and (iii) steady-state operation. Igni-
tion is started by increasing the gas flow rate through the cathode to increase the local pressure
between the cathode and the keeper. The keeper electrode is sometimes designed with a smaller
diameter [85] or relatively long orifice [86] to aid in increasing the pressure just upstream. Applying
high voltage between the keeper and cathode initiates a Paschen breakdown [1] that transitions
into a glow discharge in the heating phase sustained by field emission and secondary electron emis-
sion. This phase heats the thermionic emitter to thermionic electron emission temperatures. The
discharge then transitions to the third phase of thermionic emission and steady-state discharge
operation. At this point, the gas flow through the cathode is reduced to the nominal value and
the discharge current transferred to the thruster anode.
The major issue with heaterless ignition is arc formation during the high voltage (400–2000 V)
Paschen breakdown phase. Arcs can cause significant damage to the cathode electrodes and limit
both the number of ignitions and the cathode life. Arc initiation can be controlled by limiting the
breakdown current level [87], and Robson reported [88] that a total arc energy of 0.25 J was non-
destructive for a hollow cathode ignition. This typically requires limiting the peak arc current to
about 0.5 A, which is below [89] the “chopping current” or “arc sustaining current” on tungsten
where the arc tends to anchor on the orifice plate and causes significant surface damage. Below
the self-sustaining current level, arcs are sometimes called “microarcs” because they are momen-
tary and not anchored, which causes much less surface damage.
Care in avoiding arcing and/or limiting it to short duration microarcs are key to enabling
repeated heaterless ignitions. Figure 4-44 shows a cross section photograph of a small heaterless
LaB6 hollow cathode [86] that successfully achieved 25,000 ignitions. This cathode features a long
keeper orifice to raise the pressure in the cathode-keeper gap to reduce the Paschen initiation volt-
age to the order of only 500 V. The cathode operates in the current range of 0.5–4 A, and is designed
with extremely low heat capacity and thermal conduction to the support structures in the thruster

to achieve ignition and heating to full thermionic discharge current in less than 1 s. This cathode
has also operated for over 10,000 h at the full 4 A discharge current, indicating that the size and
operating temperature of the LaB6 insert is appropriate for long life.
Heaterless cathode technology has been recently extended to much larger, higher current hollow
cathodes capable of discharge current over 50 A [90]. The new heaterless design exploits the ten-
dency the Paschen discharge to strike at the longest path length between cathode potential electro-
des and the keeper, and uses the capabilities of refractory metal hollow cathode tubes to act as an
internal heater. The gas feed line into the upstream side of the hollow cathode is extended with a
tantalum tube part way into the insert region such that when the Paschen discharge ignites between
the tip of the tube and the keeper, the heat generated inside the tube (primarily in the last 1-cm
where the discharge attaches) radiates directly to the insert. In this “tube-radiator” heater config-
uration, the Paschen discharge connects directly to the tantalum tube in a hollow cathode mode
(sustained by the inner surface of the tube where the neutral gas pressure is high). The refractory
metal tantalum tube is very robust and can sustain microarcing during conditioning without dam-
age. The discharge spends very little time (on the order of seconds) in the >250 V Paschen discharge
regime, reducing the significance of the sputtering and arcing erosion mechanisms of this high volt-
age discharge altogether. The tantalum tube reaches thermionic emission temperatures above
2300 C within seconds, at which point the discharge transitions to an intermediate-voltage
(45–65 V) tantalum thermionic discharge, which easily provides 100–300 W of heating power radia-
tively to the insert. Once the insert reaches thermionic emission temperatures, it takes over the
majority of the electron production, the discharge voltage falls due to the lower work function emit-
ter, and the tantalum tube temperature drops as the tube discharge falls to negligible levels. Because
the insert is being radiatively heated from the inside, thermal losses to the downstream orifice plate
and upstream cathode components are reduced, so a simple ignition procedure lasting only a few
minutes is required to ignite large hollow cathodes [90]. This new heaterless technology has been
successfully applied to larger cathodes capable of hundreds of amperes of discharge current [91],
and investigations continue for electric thruster applications.
4.7.3
Hollow Cathode Thermal Models
The thermal response of the cathode to the internal plasma loads impacts how well it will perform
and also how long it will last. In cases where the plasma is fairly uniform in the insert region (such
as in low pressure Type-B cathodes or Type-C cathodes), it may be possible to employ reduced-order
plasma models [42, 44, 57, 92] like those described in Section 4.4 to obtain general trends about the
cathode’s thermal response and provide some guidance for hollow cathode design. The next level of
accuracy is obtained by using the plasma fluxes to the cathode surfaces from 2-D plasma simula-
tions that are fed into a thermal model without coupling between the two models. For example, this
is the approach followed by Katz [47, 49]. More advanced techniques have been developed [93, 94]
that couple 2-D plasma and thermal models to provide overall cathode-system performance. Such
coupled 2-D plasma and thermal models provide the best predictions of the cathode performance
and behavior at the expense of added model complexity and computer run times. Key to all these
approaches is having a tractable thermal model.
Figure 4-45 shows a sample input geometry for a 2-D cathode thermal model [47] in r-z coordi-
nates that uses the ion and electron fluxes from the 2-D plasma simulations [12] as input to predict

region. The plasma fluxes from the simulations also include heating of the cathode tube and insert
due to power deposition in the orifice region that conducts to the tube and radiates directly to the
insert.
Plasma simulations were performed of all three types of cathodes shown in Fig. 4-5 using the
OrCa2D global plasma model to provide the distribution of power to the various surfaces including
the cathode orifice [18]. In Type A cathodes, the plasma density peaks very close to the orifice plate,
and the heating is primarily in the cathode orifice region. In Type C cathodes, the plasma peaks
significantly upstream of the orifice plate, and almost all the heating occurs along the cathode
insert. This upstream progression of the heating in the cathode as the orifice diameter is increased
is shown graphically in Fig. 4-46. The heating reaches its maximum value very close to the orifice

eter increases in the Type B and Type C cathodes [18].
As an example of the results from a coupled thermal and cathode plasma model, Fig. 4-47 shows
the code predictions from the thermal model [18] and measured temperatures [51] of the insert for
the NSTAR cathode running at 12 A of discharge current. The 2-D code predicts an insert temper-
ature of about 1210 C in the first few millimeters from the orifice plate where the plasma is in good
contact with the insert. The thermal model predicts a peak temperature of about 1190 C for the
heat loads from a plasma contact area of 5 mm predicted by the plasma code. The 2-D codes also
show the sensitivity of the hollow cathode temperature to the emissivity of the orifice plate, the
thermal contact between the emitter and the tube, and orifice heating effects (especially in neutral-
izer cathodes), which impact the performance and life of the cathode. These effects cannot be
obtained from the simple 0-D models described above.
4.8
Hollow Cathode Life
Cathode insert life is fundamentally determined by either depletion of the barium emissive mix
impregnated into the dispenser cathodes such that the surface work function is degraded [95],
or by evaporation of the bulk material in refractory metal cathodes, such as tungsten and tantalum,
and in crystalline cathodes such as LaB6. The cathode mechanical structure (orifice plate, heater,
cathode tube, etc.) can also be worn or degraded [53, 54] by ion-induced sputtering, which affects
the cathode life. The impact on the cathode performance by these life-limiting fundamental
mechanisms is important to understand in designing cathodes for electric thrusters. In addition,
poisoning of inserts due to impurities in the feed gas or improper exposure to air can also increase
the work function and impact cathode life.
4.8.1
Dispenser Cathode Insert-Region Plasmas
In dispenser cathodes, evaporation of the barium layer coating the cathode surface is well under-
stood, and depletion life models can be readily constructed if this is the root cause of barium loss

[95]. However, the emitter surface is exposed to a
plasma and ion bombardment of the surface by
ions from the insert-region plasma that can
increase the loss of barium from the surface,
which will reduce the lifetime of the cathode.
Although the basic concept of a hollow cathode
is to reduce the erosion and modification of the
low work function insert surface with a high pres-
sure, collisional insert-region plasma, this benefit
had to be validated before the cathode life could be
predicted [95].
An
experimental and theoretical study of
enhanced barium evaporation from dispenser
cathode surfaces was undertaken [96] to deter-
mine the plasma conditions in the insert region
under which an evaporation model could be
used. The experimental arrangement measured
the barium evaporation from a Type-S 4 : 1 : 1
impregnated porous tungsten cathode with an
embedded heater during xenon plasma bombardment. The cathode could be biased negatively rel-
ative to the plasma to control the ion bombardment energy. The barium evaporation rate was meas-
ured by a fiber optic coupled to a visible wavelength spectrometer tuned to detect the emission
intensity of the Ba-I line at 553.5 nm excited in the plasma. Since the emission intensity depends
on the amount of Ba present in the plasma and the electron density and temperature, the plasma
parameters were monitored with a probe and the Ba-I signal normalized to a neutral xenon line to
account for any variations in plasma parameters during the measurements.
Figure 4-48 shows the barium loss rate measured at 725 C versus the ion bombardment energy.
Increasing the ion bombardment energy from 10 to 30 eV increases the barium loss rate by an order
of magnitude. Figure 4-49 shows the barium loss rate as a function of temperature for two cathode

bias energies. For the case of the cathode floating relative to the plasma, the ion bombardment
energy is only a few eV and the barium loss rate is determined solely by thermal evaporation.
For a bias energy of 15 eV, the barium loss rate is found to be the same as for thermal evaporation
for cathode temperatures in excess of about 800 C. Since the hollow cathodes in most thrusters
operate at insert temperatures in excess of 1000 C, this data shows that the barium loss rate is deter-
mined by thermal evaporation rates.
A model of the enhancement of barium evaporation for a surface under energetic ion bombard-
ment was developed by Doerner [97] to explain this behavior. At elevated surface temperatures, two
classes of surface particles must be considered: (i) those particles that are bound to the material
lattice structure (denoted here as “lattice atoms”) and (ii) atoms that have been liberated from
the lattice structure, but which are still bound to the material surface with a reduced binding energy
(denoted here as “adatoms”). Both species can sublimate from the material surface if an atom
receives enough kinetic energy from random collisions to break free from the surface; however,
because the binding energy for the two species is different, the corresponding loss rate will also
be different.
The net flux of material ΓT from the surface can be written as
ΓT = ΓiY ps + Konoe −Eo T +
Y adΓi
1 + A exp Eeff T
,
4 8-1
where Γi is the plasma ion flux, no is the areal atom density, Ko ≈υth λ, λ is the lattice scale length,
υth is the thermal velocity of the particles, Yad is the adatom production yield from the incident ion
flux, Yps is the sputtered particle yield, YadΓi is equal to the adatom loss rate due to both sublimation
and recombination. The first term in Eq. 4.8-1 describes physical sputtering of lattice atoms (which
is independent of surface temperature), the second term describes the thermal sublimation of lattice
atoms, which is independent of ion flux, and the third term describes the losses due to adatom pro-
duction and subsequent sublimation, which depends on both the incident ion flux and the surface
temperature. For Xe ions incident on BaO at 30 eV, Yps = 0.02, A = 2 × 10−9 and
Y ad
Y ps

These parameters can be used to model the expected net flux of Ba from a surface under bombard-
ment with 30 eV Xe ions for various surface temperatures. The result of this model is compared with
experimental measurements of Ba emissivity under these conditions in Fig. 4-50. The model com-
pares extremely well with the experimental results. The model also qualitatively explains the key
experimental observations, including the effect of ion energy on net erosion, the saturation of the
adatom loss term at elevated temperatures, and the transition to losses dominated by thermal sub-
limation of lattice atoms at elevated temperatures. The model has been used to examine the effect of
increasing the ion flux to the surface from the values in these experiments to the actual values for
the hollow cathodes found from the 2-D plasma model. In this case, the model predicts that thermal
evaporation dominates the barium loss rate for ion energies of less than 15 eV and cathode tem-
peratures of over 900 C. The model provides confidence that the barium loss rate effects in the
plasma are understood and that the main result of barium loss determined by thermal evaporation
rates for the plasma parameters of thruster cathodes examined here is accurate.
4.8.2
BaO Cathode Insert Temperature
Since the barium evaporation rate for the plasma conditions found in the hollow cathodes is deter-
mined by the insert surface temperature, a non-contact temperature measurement technique was
developed at JPL [98] to directly measure the insert temperature of barium oxide (BaO) cathodes
124

during cathode operation. The technique employs a stepper motor driven sapphire fiber optic probe
that is scanned along the insert inside diameter and collects the light radiated by the insert surface.
Ratio pyrometry is used to determine the axial temperature profile of the insert from the fiber optic
probe data. Thermocouples attached on the outside of the cathode on the orifice plate provide addi-
tional temperature data during operation and are used to calibrate the pyrometer system in situ
with a small oven inserted over the cathode to equilibrate the temperature.
Figure 4-51 shows temperature profiles measured for a nominal Space Station Contactor (SSC)
cathode [98] operating at four different discharge currents. The peak temperature of the insert at
the full 12 A current level is about 1200 C. The insert also has approximately a 10–15% temperature

gradient along its length. The change in the insert temperature with the xenon flow rate for the
cathode producing 12 A of discharge current is shown in Fig. 4-52. High flow rates through the
cathode is observed to reduce the insert temperature, although the effect is small.
A direct comparison of the insert temperature profile for the NSTAR discharge cathode and the
Space Station Plasma Contactor cathode at identical discharge currents of 12 A and xenon flow
rates of 6 sccm is shown in Fig. 4-53. The NSTAR insert temperature is higher than the SSC all along
the insert. It also appears that the temperatures of the inserts tend to converge near the orifice plate.
The high insert temperature for the NSTAR cathode is likely because the plasma contact area is
significantly larger at the roughly 50% lower internal pressure compared to the SSC. In addition,
thermocouple measurements on the orifice plate show that the smaller diameter SSC orifice plate is

significantly hotter than the NSTAR orifice plate, consistent with orifice heating effects described in
Section 4.5 for smaller orifice diameters.
4.8.3
Barium Depletion Model
The previous sections showed that the barium loss rate from hollow cathode dispenser cathode
inserts should be essentially the same as dispenser cathode inserts operated in vacuum if the
ion bombardment energy is sufficiently low in the hollow cathode. Since plasma potentials on axis
in the insert-region plasma of less than 15 V are routinely measured [11, 46] and sheath potentials
of less than 10 V are found from the models discussed above, the insert life will be limited by evap-
oration in the same manner as in vacuum devices.
Published measurements by Palluel and Shroff [99] of the depth of barium depletion in dispenser
cathodes as a function of time and temperature show that barium depletion obeys a simple diffusion
law with an Arrhenius dependence on temperature. This is shown in Fig. 4-54, where the impreg-
nate surface layer in the pore recedes with time. The activation energy in the diffusion coefficient
that determines the slope of the curves in Fig. 4-54 appears to be relatively independent of the cath-
ode type.
From data presented Fig. 4-54, the operating time to deplete impregnate from the insert material
to a depth of 100 μm is
ln t100μm = eVa

where the operating time τ100μm is in hours, e is the elementary charge, Va is the activation energy, k
is Boltzmann’s constant, C1 is a fit coefficient, and T is the insert temperature in degrees Kelvin. The
activation energy was found from Fig. 4-54. Using this relationship and the fact that the depletion

depth is proportional to the square root of the operating time [99], an equation yielding the insert
lifetime due to barium depletion can be derived [95]:
tlife = t100μm
y
y100μm
2
,
4 8-4
where τ100μm is the time to deplete to 100 μm in depth from Eq. 4.8-3, y is the insert thickness in μm,
and y100μm is the 100 μm reference depth. Using Eq. 4.8-3 in Eq. 4.8-4, the life of a Type S dispenser
cathode in hours is
tlife = 10 −4y2 exp 2 8244e
kT
−15 488 ,
4 8-5
where y is the insert thickness in μm and T is the insert temperature in degrees Kelvin. Figure 4-55
shows the insert life for a 1 mm depletion depth versus the insert temperature. Insert life of over
100,000 h is readily achievable if the insert is thick enough. At around a nominal 1100 C operating
temperature, the life increases a factor of two if the temperature decreases 40 C.
This model represents a worst-case estimate of the cathode life. In very high-density hollow cath-
odes, like the NSTAR cathode, the ionization mean free path for the evaporated barium is signif-
icantly less than the insert-region plasma radius. This means that a large fraction of the barium is
ionized close to the insert surface. The electric field in this region is primarily radial, which means
that some large fraction of the barium is recycled back to the surface. The barium surface coverage
is then partially re-supplied by recycling, which can extend the life considerably.
To predict cathode life in a thruster application from an insert depletion mechanism, a relation-
ship between the insert temperature and the discharge current at a given gas flow must be obtained.
The SSC insert-temperature was measured versus discharge current by Polk [98].This data is well fit
in the plasma contact region (the 3 mm closest to the orifice plate) by
T = 1010 6 I0 146
d
K
4 8-6
At 12 A of discharge current, this gives an insert temperature of 1453 K. Since the insert in this cath-
ode was about 760 μm thick and we assume that the insert is depleted when the depth reaches about
2/3rds of the thickness (due to some barium diffusion out the outside diameter of the insert),

Eq. 4.8-5 predicts a life of 30,000 h. This is in good agreement with the SSC life test data where the
cathode failed to start after about 28,000 h at 12 A of discharge current [100]. In this case, barium
recycling may not affect the insert life significantly because the plasma is in contact with the insert
for only a couple of millimeters from the orifice plate, and the barium will tend to migrate to
upstream regions that are not involved in the emission process.
For the NSTAR cathode, the insert temperature data as a function of discharge current measured
by Polk [51] is well fit in the plasma contact region by
T = 1191 6 I0 0988
d
K
4 8-7
At the full power discharge current of 13 A, and using the insert thickness of 760 μm, Eq. 4.4-5 pre-
dicts an insert life of 20,000 h. The ELT ran at full power for about 14,000 h and accumulated an
additional 16 352 h at much lower discharge currents [60]. The barium depletion model indicates
that the insert should have been depleted in the emission zone in less than 24,000 h. Measurements
indicate partial depletion in the emission region near the orifice, but that as much as 30% of the
original barium was still present. Clearly barium recycling in the plasma [43] reduced the effective
evaporation rate and extended the life of the cathode significantly.
For the NEXIS hollow cathodes, the operating insert temperature profile has not yet been meas-
ured to date. Estimates of the insert temperature were made using an early version of a combined
plasma and thermal model [93]. Since the discharge loss and efficiency performance of the NEXIS
thruster is known, the relationships in Chapter 2 can be used to plot thruster life versus engine
performance. The NEXIS ion thruster operates at 75–81% efficiency over an Isp of 6000–8000 s
[101]. Figure 4-56 shows the model predicted depletion limited life of this insert versus Isp for sev-
eral thruster power levels. At the nominal operating point of 7000 s Isp and 20 kW, the cathode is
projected to operate for about 100,000 h. Increasing the Isp requires operation at higher beam vol-
tages, which for a given power requires less beam current and, thereby, less discharge current.
A lower discharge current reduces the insert temperature for a given cathode size, which reduces
the barium evaporation rate and extends the cathode life. Likewise, lower Isp and higher power
require higher discharge currents, which translate to a reduction in the cathode life. It should

be noted that the cathode life in Eq. 4.8-5 scales as the insert thickness squared, so the life at any
operating point in Fig. 4-53 can be extended simply by increasing the thickness of the insert. This
may require increases in other dimensions, but proper selection of the cathode diameter and orifice
size can be made to maintain the insert temperature at the desired level to provide the desired life.
4.8.4
Bulk-Material Insert Life
Cathodes that are based on bulk insert material instead of dispenser chemistry, such as LaB6, have a
lifetime that is determined by the evaporation of the insert material inside the hollow cathode [37].
In plasma discharges, sputtering of the LaB6 surface can also impact the life [39]. However, as in
dispenser hollow cathodes, the plasma potential is very low in the insert region and the bombard-
ment energy of xenon ions hitting the surface is typically less than 20 V, which virtually eliminates
sputtering of the cathode surface. It is assumed that the evaporated material leaves the cathode and
does not recycle to renew the insert surface, which will provide a lower estimate of the insert life
than might actually exist. Interestingly, as the insert evaporates, the inner diameter increases and
the surface area enlarges. This causes the required current density and temperature to decrease at a
given discharge current, which reduces the evaporation rate of the insert with time.
The life of the LaB6 insert for three different cathode diameters versus discharge current was cal-
culated based on the evaporation rate at the temperature required to produce the discharge current
in the thermally-limited regime [33, 37]. Assuming that 90% of the insert can be evaporated, the
cathode life is shown in Fig. 4-57 as a function of the discharge current. Lifetimes of tens of thou-
sands of hours are possible, and the larger cathodes naturally tend to have longer life. Although
other mechanisms, such as temperature variations along the insert or LaB6 surface removal or
material build-up due to impurities in the gas, can potentially reduce the life, re-deposition of
the evaporated LaB6 material will tend to extend the cathode life. Therefore, these life estimates
for the different cathode sizes are mostly valid relative to each other, and the actual life of the cath-
ode can be considered to be on the order of the values shown in Fig. 4-57.
To obtain an idea of the life of a LaB6 cathode relative to a conventional dispenser cathode, the
predictions from a dispenser cathode life model [95] applied to the NSTAR cathode are compared to

the 0.8 cm LaB6 cathode life predictions in Fig. 4-58. These two cathodes have similar insert dia-
meters and lengths and so a direct comparison is possible. The dispenser cathode calculation
assumes that barium evaporation from the insert surface causes depletion of nearly all the barium
impregnate at the end of life in the NSTAR cathode at the measured [51] insert temperature and
temperature gradient. This provides an upper limit to the dispenser cathode life if other mechan-
isms, such as poisoning degrading the work function or impurity build-up plugging the pores, actu-
ally cause the cathode life limit. Likewise, recycling of the barium will extend the dispenser cathode
life, so uncertainties in the dispenser cathode life estimates by this model have the same uncertain-
ties due to impurities and re-deposition that are found for the LaB6 life model (although LaB6 is less
likely to be affected by impurities). Therefore, a direct comparison of calculated life versus dis-
charge current will be made with the understanding that the curves will likely shift together ver-
tically due to impurity or re-deposition issues. The LaB6 cathode life is projected to exceed the
dispenser cathode life by nearly an order of magnitude at the nominal NSTAR full power currents
of less than 15 A. If the NSTAR cathode is capable of producing higher discharge currents than
15 A, the LaB6 cathode life is still projected to exceed the NSTAR life over the full current range
demonstrated by the LaB6 cathode. As was shown in Fig. 4-54, the larger LaB6 cathodes will have
even longer lifetimes, and their life significantly exceeds that projected for the NEXIS 1.5-cm dia.

4.8.5
Cathode Poisoning
Comprehensive investigations of the poisoning of dispenser cathodes [25] and LaB6 cathodes
[102, 103] have been published in the literature. The most potent poisons for both cathodes are oxygen
and water, with other gases such as CO2 and air producing poisoning effects at higher partial pres-
sures. Figure 4-59 shows the reduction percentage of the electron emission current density in diode
tests of a Type-S 4 : 1 : 1 dispenser cathode and a LaB6 cathode as a function of the partial pressures of
oxygen and water for two different emitter temperatures. Oxygen partial pressures in the 10−7 Torr
range can completely poison the dispenser cathode at temperatures of 1100 C. In a similar manner,
water vapor at partial pressures in the 10−6 Torr range will poison dispenser cathodes at temperatures
below 1110 C. For typical pressures inside hollow cathodes in excess of 1 Torr, partial pressures in

this range represent the best purity level that can be achieved by the gas suppliers, resulting in the
high “propulsion-grade” purity mentioned above. This is the reason for stringent purity requirement
levied on conventional dispenser hollow cathode in the United States to date.
Experiments by Polk [104] showed that oxygen poisoning observed in vacuum devices only
occurs in hollow cathodes at low plasma densities (low discharge current) and high oxygen levels
(>10 PPM) in the propellant gas, and that the plasma environment inside hollow cathodes tended
to mitigate the poisoning of oxygen in dispenser cathodes. However, the plasma may aid in the
formation of volatile tungsten oxides and tungstates from the impurity gases that contribute to
tungsten migration and re-deposition on the insert surface. This modifies the dispenser cathode
surface morphology, which may affect the emission capabilities. Figure 4-60 shows a photograph

test
[60, 105]. The surface is significantly modified
and the structure on the right tended to have
low barium content.
The life and emission performance of dispenser
cathodes can also be degraded to some extent by
propellant impurities. Figure 4-61 shows an end
view of a BaO-W dispenser insert from an
NSTAR-sized hollow cathode operated with a
small air leak in the xenon propellant line. The
porous tungsten insert material formed tungsten
crystal structures on the interior surface consist-
ent with the after-test photograph in Fig. 4-60,
and the modified surface was found to be depleted
in barium. This cathode insert had essentially stopped emitting electrons because of these propel-
lant-impurity generated surface modifications, and had to be replaced to continue running the
thruster.
Lanthanum hexaboride is much less sensitive to impurities that can limit the performance
and life of the barium dispenser cathodes. Partial pressures of oxygen in the 10−5 Torr range
are required to degrade the emission of LaB6 at temperatures below 1440 C, which was shown
in Fig. 4-56. The curves for water and air poisoning of LaB6 are at much higher partial pressures
off the graph to the right. In comparison, LaB6 at 1570 C, where the electron emission current
density is nearly the same as for the dispenser cathode at 1100 C, can withstand oxygen partial
pressures up to 10−4 Torr without degradation in the electron emission. This means that LaB6
can tolerate two orders of magnitude higher impurity levels in the feed gas compared to dis-
penser cathodes operating at the same emission current density. For the case of xenon thrusters,
LaB6 cathodes can tolerate the crudest grade of xenon available (≈99.99% purity) without affect-
ing the LaB6 electron emission or life. In addition, the LaB6 surface is not significantly modified
when exposed to impurity gases compared to pure-propellant operation. The net evaporation
rate simply increases as the surface temperature increases to produce the same emission current
density as the work function changes slightly [106]. Wear testing of an LaB6 hollow cathode
with 10 PPM oxygen impurity in the xenon propellant line showed a 30% increase in the evap-
oration rate compared to “clean” xenon, and the cathode operated otherwise normally [106].
LaB6 cathodes also do not require any significant conditioning or activation procedures
that are required by dispenser cathodes. The authors have used LaB6 cathodes emitting at
currents of 5–10 A/cm2 to produce pure oxygen plasmas in background pressures of 10−3
Torr of oxygen. In this case, the operating temperature of the cathode had to be increased to
just over 1600 C to avoid poisoning of the surface by the formation of lanthanum oxide, con-
sistent with the trends in the published poisoning results shown in Fig. 4-59. The authors have
also exposed hot, operating LaB6 cathodes to atmospheric pressures of both air and water vapor.
In both cases, the system was then pumped out, the heater turned back on and the cathodes
started up normally. This incredible robustness makes handling and processing electric propul-
sion devices that use LaB6 cathodes significantly easier than thrusters that use dispenser
cathodes.

4.9
Keeper Wear and Life
In modern hollow cathodes used for electric propulsion applications, the keeper electrode typically
encloses the hollow cathode and serves the functions of facilitating the starting of the cathode by
bringing a high positive voltage close to the orifice and protecting the cathode from ion bombard-
ment from the cathode plume and thruster plasmas. However, the keeper electrode is biased during
normal operation at an intermediate potential between cathode and anode to collect a reduced
number of electrons and, since it is below the plasma potential, it is subject to ion bombardment
and wear. Cathode orifice plate and keeper electrode erosion rates measured or inferred in various
experiments [107, 108] and in ion thruster life tests [59, 60, 109] have been found to be much higher
than anticipated. For example, Fig. 4-62 shows the NSTAR cathode before and after the 30 352 h
Extended Life Test [110]. The keeper electrode was completely eroded away by the end of the test,
exposing the cathode orifice plate to the thruster discharge chamber plasma, which significantly
eroded the cathode orifice plate and the sheath-heater surfaces. These results have been attributed
to the high-energy ions bombarding and sputtering the cathode and keeper electrodes.
A significant effort has been expended trying to understand the mechanism for this rapid erosion.
Several organizations have measured the presence of high-energy ions in ion thrusters and in the
neighborhood of hollow cathodes using retarding potential analyzers (RPA) [64, 65, 111, 112] and
laser induced fluorescence (LIF) [113]. For example, Fig. 4-63 shows the ion energy distribution
measured [65] downstream on-axis and radially away from the plume of the NSTAR cathode.
The high-energy ions are detected in both locations, with varying amounts depending on the posi-
tion at which they are detected. The energy of some of the ions is greatly in excess of the 26-V dis-
charge voltage, and if these ions were to hit the keeper or cathode orifice, they could cause
significant erosion.
The source and characteristics of the high-energy ions have been the subject of much research
and debate. Models of a DC potential hill [114] located inside or just downstream of the cathode
orifice, or ion acoustic instabilities in a double layer postulated in the orifice of the cathode [115],
have been proposed to explain the production of these ions. However, in detailed scanning probe
studies to date [11, 16, 46, 62], there has been no detectable potential hill or unstable double layer at
the cathode orifice or in the cathode plume that might support these mechanisms as responsible for

the high-energy ions or the electrode wear rates and erosion patterns. However, low frequency
plasma potential oscillations in the 50–150 kHz range associated with plasma ionization instabil-
ities have been detected in the near-cathode plume across the front of the keeper by scanning emis-
sive probes [64, 65]. This instability is discussed more detail in the next section, and the large plasma
potential fluctuations observed in the experiments have been proposed as a mechanism for accel-
erating ions to higher energy. In this case, ions born at the peak potential gain the full rf potential
energy when striking the keeper or cathode surfaces, which can exceed 40–80 eV [65]. The fluctua-
tions then produce sufficient ion energy to explain
the keeper-face erosion reported in the literature.
In some cases the ion energies measured by the
RPAs approach or exceed 100 eV, which is in
excess of the plasma potential fluctuation ampli-
tudes typically measured. Mechanisms responsi-
ble for this, like that proposed by Katz [116]
due to charge exchange collisions in the near-
cathode plume region, can lead to ions with
higher energies than the measured plasma poten-
tials excursions, are also being investigated.
The complete mechanism for high-energy ion
generation, the measured energies of these ions
by various techniques, and the resulting erosion
rates of the cathode and keeper electrodes are still
under investigation at this time. Detailed 2-D
modeling [54, 55] and additional experimental
investigations are underway to understand this
problem. One mitigation is to change the keeper
material to graphite, which has a significantly
lower sputter-yield compared to refractory metals.

Figure 4-64 shows the texturing of the graphite keeper surface after a 2000 h wear test of the
1.5-cm-dia. LaB6 hollow cathode [106]. This slight surface modification is in the same pattern as
seen in the NSTAR cathode wear testing [59], but negligible erosion occurred and the keeper life
is projected to be very long. A second mitigation is to identify the instabilities in the near-cathode
plume region responsible for the energetic ion generation and develop techniques to damp them
sufficiently to avoid the energetic ion production. The near-cathode plasma instabilities and
damping techniques are discussed in the next section.
4.10
Discharge Behavior and Instabilities
The electron discharge from a hollow cathode can be ignited by several mechanisms. In Type
A cathodes and some Type B with small orifices, the electrostatic (vacuum) potential from the
keeper or anode electrode does not penetrate significantly through the relatively long, thin orifice
into the insert region. In this case, electrons emitted in the insert region cannot be accelerated to
cause ionization because there is no anode potential visible from inside the cathode. However, if the
cathode uses a barium dispenser insert, then barium evaporated from the insert when heated can
deposit on the upstream side of the cathode orifice plate and inside the orifice and diffuse onto the
downstream surface of the orifice plate [117] facing the keeper electrode. The work function sub-
sequently decreases, and the vacuum thermionic emission from the orifice plate to the keeper can
be sufficient to ignite a discharge once gas is introduced. The plasma then penetrates the orifice,
extending the anode potential into the insert the region and the discharge transitions directly to
the insert. The orifice plate is subject to sputter erosion by the ions in the discharge, and the barium
layer is removed by this ion bombardment and has to be reestablished if the cathode is turned off in
order to restart [118].
For cathodes with larger orifices (typically 2-mm dia. or larger), a sufficient keeper voltage (typ-
ically 100–500 V) will cause the applied positive potential to penetrate inside the insert region at
levels in excess of the ionization potential of the propellant gas. The electrons from the insert
can then be accelerated locally inside the insert and cause ionization, which ignites the discharge
through the orifice to the keeper or anode. This is the mechanism used in most of the LaB6 cathodes
developed by the authors to strike the discharge.
For hollow cathodes with smaller orifices or inhibited orifice plate emission (due to surface impu-
rities, barium depletion, etc.), the arc-initiation technique described in Section 4.7.2 on heaterless
hollow cathodes is typically used, even for cathodes with heaters. In this case, the keeper voltage is
pulsed to a high positive value (typically >500 V) and the discharge starts due to either field emis-
sion of electrons from the orifice plate ionizing the injected cathode gas, or Paschen breakdown
occurring in the cathode-to-keeper gap generating plasma that penetrates the orifice into the insert
region. To ensure reliable thruster ignition over life, it is standard to apply both a DC keeper-voltage
in the 50–150 V range and pulsed keeper voltage in the 300–600 V range. After the discharge is
ignited, the heater is turned off, the keeper current is limited by the power supply and the keeper
voltage falls to a value below the discharge voltage.
4.10.1
Discharge Modes
Once ignited and having transitioned to a thermionic discharge, hollow cathodes are well known to
operate in distinct discharge “modes” [10]. Hollow cathodes have been historically characterized as
having a quiescent “spot mode” with a broadly optimum gas flow at a given current, and a noisy
136
4 Hollow Cathodes

“plume mode” with the gas flow below the level at which the spot-mode is obtained [4, 10, 63]. The
spot-mode, seen in Fig. 4-65 left, is visually observed as manifesting a sphere or “spot” of plasma just
downstream of the cathode orifice and a slowly expanding plasma column extending from the spot
to the anode. The plume mode, seen in Fig. 4-65 right, has a widely diverging plasma cone extend-
ing from the cathode, often filling the vacuum chamber with diffuse plasma with little or no spot or
sphere of plasma in the cathode/keeper orifice. In neutralizer cathodes at low current there is usu-
ally a sudden transition between these modes, but in high current cathodes with larger orifices
there is a continuous transition between these modes. At very high gas flows well above the opti-
mum for the spot mode the spot moves downstream and the plume becomes more collimated and
unstable because of the onset of ion acoustic turbulence [72, 77]. Very high cathode flow rates tend
to suppress the discharge voltage, which adversely affects the ionization rate and discharge perfor-
mance in discharge cathodes in ion thrusters. However, higher flow rates tend to also reduce the
coupling voltage in both Hall and ion thruster neutralizer cathodes, which can improve the
performance.
Hollow cathode discharge modes have been examined in detail in the laboratory because of the
observed increases in the keeper or coupling voltages in the plume mode [4, 63, 115, 119, 120], and
increases in keeper wear [50, 60] due to the production of energetic ions. At flow rates near the
optimum for the spot mode, thermionic hollow cathodes can produce quiescent discharges
[64, 115]. Plume mode transition [10] is usually detected by increases in the oscillation of the keeper
voltage or in the magnitude of the coupling voltage. For example, plume mode onset is defined in
the NSTAR neutralizer when the keeper voltage oscillation exceeds ±5 V peak-to-peak. Transition
to plume mode occurs for too low a propellant flow at a given emission current (or too high a dis-
charge current for a given flow), and is usually detected by increases in both the keeper and dis-
charge voltage oscillations. Transition to plume mode can also be affected by the anode location
and design [10, 65, 121], with flat anodes sometimes used in cathode test facilities tending to cause
plume mode onset at higher flows (for a given current) than cylindrical anodes.
In plume mode, and even in the transition to plume mode as the flow is reduced or the current
raised, cathodes produce ions with energies significantly in excess of the discharge voltage that
cause significant keeper and cathode orifice erosion. Figure 4-66 shows the ion distribution func-
tion measured by a compact scanning RPA [122] located at the face of the keeper on the high

current X3 LaB6 cathode [83] operating at 100 A of discharge current. Ions with energies in excess of
50 eV are seen to be incident on the keeper face, even at the nominal 16 sccm flow for this operating
condition of this cathode. Higher currents are observed to produce even higher ion energies.
In terms of the plasma dynamics in the cathode exterior, plume mode oscillations have been
observed in the laboratory as having three main features: (i) they are quasi-coherent and longitu-
dinal with frequencies ranging from 10 to 150 kHz [64, 65]; (ii) they are characterized by large-scale
oscillations in plasma density, plasma potential, and discharge current with amplitudes approach-
ing 100% of the background; and (iii) the modes appear to be either dispersionless or propagating
with the ion drift speed from the cathode to anode [123]. It is generally accepted that these are ion-
ization instabilities as shown by Goebel [65]. There are additional instabilities that can be present in
the plume, such as IAT and rotational modes, that will also be described below.
The dynamics of the plasma exterior to the hollow cathode in plume mode can be visually seen by
high speed cameras. Figure 4-67 presents three frames from the high-speed camera footage cap-
tured when the X3 LaB6 cathode was operated without any applied magnetic field at 100 A of dis-
charge current and 9 sccm xenon gas flow. This condition results in the onset of plume mode for this
cathode. The leftmost frame was acquired at time t = 0, while the following frames were taken after
t = 2.55 μs and t = 3.83 μs. The images are for the camera pointing at the side with the cathode exit
on the left and the anode is on the right separated by a distance of 21 mm. The plume-mode cathode

produces plasma bursts that propagate axially to the anode. Fast camera images looking directly at
the cathode through a cylindrical anode show an azimuthally uniform plume. This mode matches
the behavior of ionization instabilities observed in the experiments [65] and was described as axial
modes by Georgin [123].
The ionization instabilities grow at a given discharge current when the input gas flow is below a
certain threshold. The ionization tends to deplete the local neutral gas, which causes the neutral
density to drop and reduce the discharge current-carrying plasma density, forcing the system to
oscillate on the ionization-rate time scales. Simulations and experiments show that non-classical
electron heating via ion acoustic waves can couple with these instabilities, raising their frequency
above the ionization rate frequency and increasing their growth [124]. The axial burst visible
through the high-speed camera has some similarity with the well-known breathing mode or pred-
ator–prey ionization-instability mode characteristic of Hall thruster plumes [125].
The complexity of the physics of these modes, and how they transition from one to another, has
made first-principles analyses and ab initio predictions longstanding challenges for the modeling
and numerical simulation community. A breakthrough was achieved when an advanced version of
the OrCa2D code was employed to simulate the transition from spot to plume modes [55] in a 25-A
LaB6 cathode. This work produced global 2-D axisymmetric simulations that yielded good agree-
ment with the so-called plume mode margin — typically a measurement of the peak-to-peak keeper
voltage fluctuations as a function of the cathode mass flow rate. The main findings from that work
are outlined next.
Two separate simulations, designated as “Simulation A” and “Simulation B” in Fig. 4-68, were
performed in the flow rate range of 5–20 sccm. Both simulations used Eq. 4.6-2 for the anomalous
collision frequency, but in A the ratio Te/Ti was held fixed whereas in B it was varied. The simula-
tions captured well the measured peak-to-peak oscillations of the keeper voltage (Vk-pp) as shown in
the figure. The computed spectra showed that most of the oscillation power resided in the range of
100–300 kHz. It is also worth mentioning that the values in this range are much greater than the
local ionization frequency. As the flow rate was reduced the region in the plume where the neutral
gas was notably depleted grew in size. This is shown in Fig. 4-69 right which depicts contours of the

time-averaged neutral gas density. The spatial extent of the time-averaged plasma density column
in the plume also diminished as the flow rate was decreased as shown in Fig. 4-69 left. This work
revealed that there is a clear connection between the depletion of the neutral gas in the plume and
the transition of the discharge from spot to plume modes. Equally important however was the find-
ing that although the discharge dynamics are undoubtedly linked to the neutral gas density in the
plume, they are also linked to the anomalous electron transport. No oscillations were found in
the simulations in the absence of the IAT-driven anomalous resistivity. Moreover, in the presence
of the anomalous resistivity the amplitude of the oscillations increased with decreasing density in
the plume but so did the ratio of the anomalous over the classical collision frequencies.
It is important to realize that the large discharge instabilities and oscillations produced during
plume mode only occur in the exterior of Type A and B hollow cathodes [65]. Figure 4-70 shows
the ion saturation current measured simultaneously inside the insert region and immediately out-
side the keeper in the above experiments during plume mode with the ionization instability. The
plasma density oscillations inside the cathode insert-region plasma are small in amplitude and

uncorrelated to the ionization and large turbulent instabilities observed outside in the near-cathode
plume region. This was also the finding in the numerical simulations described above [55]. As
shown in Fig. 4-69, operating at higher gas flows, which are selected to avoid plume mode, produces
sufficient plasma density to carry the discharge current without plasma oscillations, and the lower
electron temperatures and collisional effects in the cathode plume plasma at higher neutral den-
sities tend to dampen or extinguish the oscillations.
The numerical simulations results shown in Figs. 4-68 and 4-69 accounted for the largely axial
magnetic field that is typically applied in discharge hollow cathodes. An applied magnetic field
in the cathode plume region tends to damp ionization instabilities by confining the electrons
and increasing the local ionization rate. However, it may also excite other low frequency
(50–100 kHz) instabilities in this region of the cathode. Rotational modes, for example, were first
observed by Jorns and Hofer [126] in the plume of a hollow cathode on a Hall thruster during obser-
vations with a Fast Camera. Jorns attributed this mode to anti-drift waves [126]. Experimental work
by Becatti et al. [127] showed the existence of rotating magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) kink modes
in the plume of a high current hollow cathode, also using a Fast Camera. Becatti correlated the
amplitude of the MHD modes with the production of energetic ions incident on the keeper face
as measured by an RPA on a reciprocating probe assembly. The growth rate of these two rotational
instabilities was found to be comparable [127], and it is likely that these modes compete in the cath-
ode plume. As the discharge current increases, these rotational modes could contribute more to the
production of energetic ions and increases in erosion of the keeper and thruster components.
The spot-to-plume mode simulations of the 25-A cathode also revealed oscillations in the near-
plume plasma [55]. The waves were largely longitudinal, with wave vector in the axial direction and
phase velocity ω/k > 10 km/s, which is more than six times greater than the ion acoustic speed.
Rotational modes could not be captured by the simulations since the computational model was
2-D axisymmetric. Mikellides suggested that the rotational modes observed in the experiment could
in fact be coupled to the longitudinal mode they observed in their simulations, yielding a complex
3-D plasma motion. He argued that since their simulations reproduced well the measured plume
mode margin, it was the longitudinal plasma motion that drove the transition from spot to plume
modes at this low discharge current from the cathode where Becatti et al. demonstrated that the
rotational modes are near their onset threshold [128]. At higher discharge currents, the stronger
rotational modes compete with the longitudinal modes depending on the operating conditions
[10], and may dominate plume mode onset.
There have been even more numerical simulations using the 2-D axisymmetric model of the Hall
thruster called Hall2De [129], which is described in Chapter 7. These new results were combined
with the dispersion relation of waves in the lower hybrid frequency range and showed that, radially
away from the most dense region of the cathode plume, the modified two-stream instability (MTSI)
and lower hybrid drift instability (LHDI) can become excited [130, 131]. In the Hall thruster-
cathode arrangement, the LHDI is driven by the diamagnetic and E × B drifts, both of which
are in a direction perpendicular to the r-z plane (rotational direction).
4.10.2
Suppression of Instabilities and Energetic Ion Production
Energetic ions have been correlated to the various instabilities (ionization, turbulent ion acous-
tic, and rotational) detected in the hollow cathode plume. Of critical importance is the suppres-
sion of these instabilities to minimize any impacts on cathode life. Although the configuration
and operating conditions (current and gas flow rate) can be selected over a limited range to min-
imize the onset of these instabilities to help reduce the erosion rates [78, 132], changing the
4.10 Discharge Behavior and Instabilities
141

cathode operating conditions (current or flow) to throttle the thruster, or running at high dis-
charge current for high power thrusters, causes the instabilities to grow with an increase in ener-
getic ion production. The only technique found to be successful to date to suppress the energetic
ion production, especially as the discharge current is increased, is neutral gas injection directly
into the hollow cathode plume [65, 120, 133, 134]. This technique was also considered soon after
early OrCa2D simulations suggested the presence of IAT-driven anomalous resistivity in the
cathode plume [52].
Two techniques have been developed to inject neutral gas into the cathode plume. Gas injection
external to the cathode using small electrically floating tubes positioned near the cathode exit has
been the most successful. Figure 4-71 shows photos of the original testing at JPL [120] on an
NSTAR-like cathode at full power (13.1 A) with a single injector above a cathode plume. The dis-
charge on the left has a halo around the main plume column characteristic of plasma instabilities,
and the injection of neutral gas into the plume in the photo on the right damps the instabilities and
eliminates the halo. Figure 4-72 shows RPA data for the ion energies for these two cases. Gas injec-
tion reduces the ion energies arriving at cathode potential from over 80 eV to below about 40 eV.
Experiments by Chu [133] showed that using two gas injector tubes was the most effective in redu-
cing the ion energies with the lowest amount of gas injection. Figure 4-73 shows the high current X3
cathode with its the dual exterior gas injectors. This configuration was successfully used in the XR-
100 Hall thruster testing at up to 250 A [135]. An interesting benefit of external gas injection is that
the gas required to optimally run the hollow cathode insert-region plasma [20] is much less than
that needed for good coupling to the Hall thruster [136]. Experiments on the XR-100 Hall thruster
showed that the total cathode flow split needed to optimally run the thruster was reduced by several
percent using this external injection system [133], with a corresponding increase in the total
thruster efficiency.
The second method to introduce neutral gas into the plume is through the cathode to keeper gap
[10, 134, 137]. In this case, the gas is injected through the cathode mounting flange on the outside
the cathode tube but inside the keeper tube, and enters the discharge through the keeper orifice.
The increased pressure downstream of the cathode orifice does little to change the pressure in the

insert region. This method avoids the mechan-
ical complexity of the exterior gas injector
tubes, and is almost as effective as that tech-
nique. Approximately 10–20% more gas in
needed for this “interior” injection technique
to be as effective in reducing the ion energy
in the plume, likely because the gas is heated
passing over the hot cathode tube and because
some is ionized and depleted in the cathode
plume very close to the keeper before entering
the instability generation region in the near
cathode plume. Nevertheless, interior injection
was very effective in the XR-100 testing because
the thruster requires much more gas for cou-
pling the cathode to the thruster plasma than
the cathode requires to produce the discharge
current [138].
The technique of injecting gas between the
cathode-to-keeper gap and into the cathode
plume from the keeper orifice plate is effective up to very high discharge currents. The 500 A
LaB6 hollow cathode recently developed [134] used this technique, combined with a cathode orifice
designed to keep the electron current density below 1 kA/cm2, to suppress ionization instabilities
and produce low energetic ion production in the cathode plume. Measurements made with the fast
scanning RPA at the keeper face (collecting ions from downstream) showed that the ion energy
impacting the keeper was well below 40 eV at discharge currents up to 350 A [134].

(indicated as “mc”) and through the internal injector (indicated as “mi”). Increasing flow rates
through both the cathode and the internal injector lower the discharge voltage at any current.
The minimum of the “U-shaped” discharge curves is usually selected as the nominal “Spot-Mode”
location with the lowest oscillation levels. On the left side of the curves, the discharge voltage
increases at a lower current as the cathode increases the internal sheath voltage to provide sufficient
insert heating at the lower discharge currents. On the right side of the curves, the discharge voltage
increases with discharge current because of the finite resistivity of the insert, orifice and plume plas-
mas, and the resistance of the electrical connections to the cathode. The maximum current at a
given flow was determined by the onset of plume mode oscillations up to the 300 A limit of the
power supply used in this testing. The experiment used a large 10-cm-dia. cylindrical anode that
could handle the high heat flux of the nearly 9 kW discharge power. The cylindrical anode also traps
some of the cathode gas flow near the cathode exit to increase the plasma generation in the cathode
plume and avoid plume mode and instability problems. The onset of the oscillations and the tran-
sition to plume mode is an anode-plasma effect.
There are basically four types of oscillations that occur in hollow cathode discharges [10, 65, 78,
126]: power supply oscillations; ionization-instability oscillations, turbulent ion acoustic oscilla-
tions; and rotational oscillations. The plasma discharge oscillations occur exterior to the cathode
in the near-cathode plume and typically are in the frequency range of 50 to over 1000 kHz. The
plasma oscillations have amplitudes that cause voltage variations on the closely coupled keeper
electrode from fractions of a volt in the spot mode to tens of volts in plume mode. If sufficiently
large, these oscillations can trigger regulation problems in the discharge power supply, leading
to large discharge voltage oscillations occurring on the power-supply-regulation times of typically
100–1000 Hz. This behavior is shown in Fig. 4-75.
In the ionization instabilities, or so-called predator–prey oscillations, the plasma discharge burns
out a significant fraction of the neutral gas in the near cathode plume, and the discharge collapses

ities in the 50–250 kHz range for xenon depending on the physical scale lengths and size of the
discharge components. Ionization instabilities are easily observed in the plasma density, which
is shown by the probe’s ion saturation current oscillations in Fig. 4-76 and compared to the nor-
mally present incoherent turbulent ion acoustic modes even in spot mode. Likewise, the application
of an axial magnetic field introduces rotational modes (drift and lower hybrid waves as well as MHD
oscillations) discussed above that compete with the ionization and ion acoustic instabilities in the
near-cathode plume.

only 200 W of power. Specifically, what is the filament length and emission current den-
sity? You can neglect axial conduction of power to the electrical connections and assume
that the emissivity of tungsten is 0.3 at emission temperatures.
b) You decide to use a 0.25-mm diameter and 4 cm long filament to limit the radiated power.
What is the temperature of the emitter, and how much power is actually radiated?

b) If the insert has a uniform plasma with ne = 1020 m−3 density and Te = 2 eV inside it, how
much is the electron emission enhanced by the Schottky effect if the sheath is 10 V and 3
Debye lengths thick? What is the total emission current?
c) Is the emission current space charge limited?

create an internal pressure of 2 Torr at 1500 K in the hollow cathode. Assuming the insert-
region plasma is infinitely long, what is the electron temperature in the insert-region plasma
and the radial ion drift velocity at the wall?
4.4
For the cathode geometry in problem 4.3, what is the internal plasma density for an emission
current of 30 A and a heating power of 100 W assuming a uniform plasma density with an
electron temperature of 1.2 eV? (Hint: Estimate the resistivity for the sheath voltage, find
plasma density, then iterate).
4.5
A lanthanum hexaboride hollow cathode 2 cm inside diameter and 2.5 cm long emits 20 A of
electrons into a uniform 2 × 1019 m−3 plasma with an electron temperature of 1.5 eV. For a
heating power of 40 W and an internal xenon pressure of 1.2 Torr at 1500 K, find the ion and
electron heating powers to the insert. Why is one larger than the other?
4.6

3 Torr at a temperature of 2000 K, what is the electron temperature? (neglect end losses)
4.7
A neutralizer cathode produces 3 A of electron current through a 0.6 mm diameter orifice that
is 1.5 mm long. Assuming that the electron temperature in the orifice is 1.5 eV, the electron
temperature in the insert region is 1.2 eV, the pressure is 50 Torr at 2000 K and the sheath
voltage at the wall is 12 V, what is the plasma density, the ion heating of the orifice plate,
and the axial voltage drop in the orifice plasma?

the orifice exit with a characteristic length of 0.5 mm (i.e. one e-folding for every 0.5 mm of
distance from the cathode). Assuming 15 V primary electrons in the cathode plume and that
all of the ions generated fall back through the sheath, find the location downstream of the
orifice exit where a double layer might occur (hint: where the electron current is greater than
the square root of the mass ratio times the ion current).
4.9
A Hall thruster hollow cathode has a cathode orifice diameter of 3 mm and produced 20 A of
15 V primary electrons with a xenon gas flow of 10 sccm. Assume that the gas is at 2000 K
and the neutral plume diverges at 45 deg. from the orifice.
a) Neglecting depletion of the electron current due to ionization, how much of the cathode
gas low is ionized within 10 cm of the cathode?
b) Assume that every electron that makes an ionization collision is lost (loses most of its
energy and is rapidly thermalized), and that the neutral atom is also lost (depleted).
How much of the cathode gas flow is then ionized with 10 cm of the cathode?
c) If the primary electron energy is 20 eV, how much of the gas flow is ionized within 10 cm
of the orifice accounting for depletion of both the primary electrons and the neutral gas
due to ionization?

life if barium loss is the life-limiting effect?
b) What is the thruster efficiency, Isp, and thrust?

Ion Thruster Plasma Generators
Ion thrusters are characterized by the electrostatic acceleration of ions extracted from a plasma gen-
erator. Ion thruster geometries are best described in terms of three basic components: the ion accel-
erator, the plasma generator and the electron neutralizer. The ion accelerator described in
Chapter 6 typically uses electrically-biased multi-aperture grids to produce the ion beam. The neu-
tralizer cathode, which is discussed in Chapter 4, is positioned outside the thruster body to provide
electrons to neutralize the ion beam and maintain the potential of the thruster and spacecraft rel-
ative to the space plasma potential. In this chapter, three types of the third component of modern
flight ion thrusters, namely the plasma generator, are discussed. These plasma generators utilize
DC electron discharges, rf discharges, and microwave discharges to produce the plasma. Phys-
ics-based models will be developed and used throughout the chapter to describe the performance
and characteristics of these different plasma generation techniques.
5.1
Introduction
The basic geometry of an ion thruster plasma generator is illustrated well by the classic DC electron
discharge plasma generator. This version of the thruster plasma generator utilizes an anode poten-
tial discharge chamber with a hollow cathode electron source to generate the plasma from which
ions are extracted to form the thrust beam. A simplified schematic of a DC electron bombardment
ion thruster with these components coupled to a multi-grid accelerator is shown in Fig. 5-1. Neutral
propellant gas is injected into the discharge chamber and a small amount is also injected through
the hollow cathode. Electrons extracted from the hollow cathode enter the discharge chamber and
ionize the propellant gas. To improve the efficiency of the discharge in producing ions, some form of
magnetic confinement is typically employed at the anode wall. The magnetic fields provide confine-
ment primarily of the energetic electrons, which increases the electron path length before loss to the
anode wall and improves the ionization probability of the injected electrons. Proper design of the
magnetic field is critical to providing sufficient confinement for high efficiency while maintaining
adequate electron loss to the anode to produce stable discharges over the operation range of the
thruster.
Several power supplies are required to operate the cathode and plasma discharge. A simplified
electrical schematic typically used for DC-discharge plasma generators is shown in Fig. 5-2. The
cathode heater supply raises the thermionic emitter to a sufficient temperature to emit electrons,

and is turned off once the plasma discharge is ignited. The keeper electrode positioned around the
hollow cathode tube is used to facilitate striking the hollow cathode discharge, and also protects the
cathode from ion bombardment from the discharge chamber region. The cathode and the keeper
are discussed in Chapter 4. The discharge supply is connected between the hollow cathode and the
anode and is normally run in the current regulated mode to provide a stable discharge at different
power levels.
RF and microwave ion thrusters utilize nearly identical ion accelerator and electron neutralizer
implementations as the DC-discharge ion thruster. However, these thrusters do not employ a dis-
charge hollow cathode or anode power supply. These components are replaced by rf or microwave
antenna structures, sources of rf or microwave power and compatible discharge chambers to ionize
the propellant gas and deliver the ions to the accelerator structure. These thrusters also utilize
either applied or self-generated magnetic fields to improve the ionization efficiency of the system.

5 Ion Thruster Plasma Generators

The three thruster plasma generators to be discussed here—DC electron discharge, rf, and micro-
wave discharge—have been successfully developed and flown in space. The principles of these
different classes of plasma generators are described in the following sections after a discussion
of the plasma generator efficiency that can be expected in an idealized case.
5.2
Idealized Ion Thruster Plasma Generator
It is worthwhile to examine an ion thruster in the simplest terms to provide an understanding of the
dominant processes in the particle flows and energy transport required to produce the plasma. The
idealized thruster model has power injected by arbitrary means into a volume filled with neutral gas
to produce ionization and neutral gas excitation, with all the ions going to the accelerator grids and
an equal number of plasma electrons going to the wall to conserver charge. This is illustrated sche-
matically in Fig. 5-3. For this model, the thruster discharge chamber has a volume V that fully
encloses the plasma that is produced by ionization of neutral gas by the plasma electrons. The ions
from the plasma flow only to the accelerator grid structure (perfect confinement elsewhere in the
discharge chamber) with a current given by the Bohm current:
Ii = 1
2 nie υaA,
5 2-1
where ni is the ion density in the center of the volume, υa is the ion acoustic velocity, A is the total
ion loss area which is assumed to be only the grid area, and the ions are assumed to be cold relative
to the electrons. The ion beam current is then the ion current to the grids multiplied by the effective
grid transparency Tg:
Ib = 1
2 nie υaATg,
5 2-2
where the current lost to the accel and decel grids has been neglected as small. Ions are assumed to
be produced by ionization of neutral particles by the plasma electrons in the discharge chamber at a
rate given by
Ip = nonee σiυe V,
5 2-3
where no is the neutral gas density, ne is the plasma
electron density, σi is the ionization cross section, υe
is the electron velocity, and the term in the brackets
is the reaction rate coefficient which is the ioniza-
tion cross section averaged over the Maxwellian
electron velocity distribution function. The formu-
lation of the reaction rate coefficient was described
in Chapter 3 and the values for xenon and krypton
as a function of electron temperature are given in
Appendix E.
Power is conserved in the system, so the power
put into the plasma is equal to the power that comes
out in the form of charged particles and radiation.
To first order, the power injected into the plasma
goes into ionization and excitation of the neutral

electrons. The power that is put into the system is then
Pin = IpU + + I∗U∗+ Iiεi + ne e V

5 2-4
where U+ is the ionization potential of the propellant gas, U∗is the excitation potential of the gas, τ
is the average electron confinement time, εi is the ion energy carried to the walls and εe is the elec-
tron energy carried to the walls by the electrons leaving the plasma. The term I∗is the excited neu-
tral production rate, given by
I∗=
j
nonee σ∗υe jV,
5 2-5
where σ∗is the excitation cross section and the reaction rate coefficient is averaged over the electron
distribution function and summed over all possible excited states j. Using Eqs. 5.2-3 and 5.2-5 in
Eq. 5.2-4, the power input can then be written as
Pin = no ne e σiυe V U + +
σ∗υe j

Assuming quasi-neutrality (ni ≈ne) and that the ions and electrons leave the volume by ambipolar
flow at the same rate, which is a function of the mean confinement time τ, the ion current out is
given by
Ii = 1
2 ni e υaA = Ib

5 2-7
where the Ib is the beam current and Tg is the grid transparency. The mean confinement time for
ions and electrons is then

5 2-8
The energy that an electron removes from the plasma as it goes to the wall is given by
εe = 2 kTe
e
+ ϕ,
5 2-9
where ϕ is the plasma potential relative to the wall. Equation 5.2-9 is derived in Appendix C. The
ions fall first through the pre-sheath potential, approximated by TeV/2 to produce the Bohm veloc-
ity, and then through the sheath potential. Since the potential in Eq. 3.7-52 is defined at the center
of the plasma, each ion then removes from the plasma a total energy per ion of
εi = 1

The plasma potential in these two equations is found from the electron current leaving the plasma,
which is given by Eq. 3.7-52:

where Aa is the electron loss area and m is the electron mass. Since ambipolar ion and electron flow
to the wall was assumed, equate Eqs. 5.2-1 and 5.2-11 and use
kTe M for the ion acoustic velocity
to give the plasma potential between the wall and the plasma as:
ϕ = ϕf = kTe

5 2-12
Equation 5.2-12 is normally called the floating potential ϕf and appears in this case because there are
no applied potentials in our ideal thruster to draw a net current.
The electron temperature can be found by equating the ion production and loss rates, Eqs. 5.2-1
and 5.2-3, which gives
kTe M
σiυe

5 2-13
The reaction rate coefficient in the denominator depends on the electron temperature, and so this
equation can be solved for the electron temperature if the discharge chamber volume, neutral pres-
sure, and ion loss area are known.
The discharge loss is defined as the power into the plasma divided by the beam current out of the
thruster, which is a figure of merit for the efficiency of the plasma generation mechanism. The dis-
charge loss for this idealized thruster, using Eq. 5.2-2 for the beam current, is then given by

As evident in Eq. 5.2-14, the grid transparency (Tg) directly affects the discharge loss, and the input
power is distributed between the first term related to producing ions and excited neutrals, and the
second term related to heating the electrons that are lost to the walls.
To evaluate Eq. 5.2-14, the ratio of the excitation to ionization reaction rates as a function of the
Maxwellian electron temperature must be known. This is shown in Fig. 5-4 for xenon gas from data
in Appendixes E. For electron temperatures below about 8 V, the excitation rate exceeds the ion-
ization rate in xenon for Maxwellian electrons. Since the lowest excitation potential is near the ion-
ization potential in xenon, this higher excitation rate results in more of the input power being
radiated to the walls than producing ions. This effect explains at least part of the inefficiency inher-
ent in xenon plasma generators. Excitation rates equal to or higher than the ionization rate at low
electron temperatures are also generally found for other inert gas propellants.
The discharge loss from Eq. 5.2-14 for this ideal thruster example is plotted as a function of the
mass utilization efficiency for a generic 20 cm diameter thruster in Fig. 5-5 with three different dis-
charge chamber lengths, where the ionization potential of xenon of 12.13 V, an average excitation
potential of 10 V, and 80% of the ions incident on the grids become beam ions (Tg = 0.8) are used. It
was also assumed for simplicity that the plasma electrons were lost to the floating screen grid, and it
will be shown later that the area of the electron loss affects the thruster discharge efficiency and
stability of the discharge. The mass utilization efficiency is inversely proportional to the neutral
density in the thruster, which will be derived in Section 5.3.5. In the figure, the discharge loss is
shown in eV/ion, which has the equivalent units to Watts of discharge power per Ampere of beam
ions (W/A). In an ideal plasma generator case with 80% of the ions that are generated and headed to
5.2 Idealized Ion Thruster Plasma Generator

the accelerator grids assumed to become beam current, the amount of power required to produce 1
A of beam current is well over 120 W. While it only takes 12.13 eV to ionize a xenon atom, even in
an idealized thruster it takes about ten times this energy to produce and deliver an ion into the beam
because of other losses. The dependence on discharge chamber length illustrates the surface to vol-
ume effect in the thruster where the ionization is a volume process and the loss to the walls is a
surface process. The longer thruster has a smaller surface-to-volume ratio, and so has more efficient
ion generation and a lower discharge loss.

It is informative to see where the extra input power goes in the thruster. Figure 5-6 shows the
power lost in each of the four energy loss mechanisms described above for an ideal thruster 30-
cm long producing 1 A of beam current. The ionization power is constant in this case because this
example was constrained to produce 1 A, and the power required per beam ampere is then (1/0.8)∗
12.13 = 15.1 W. The major power loss is excitation at low mass utilization where the neutral density
is high and electron temperature is low because of the higher neutral density, as shown in Fig. 5-4.
However, this excitation loss decreases with mass utilization efficiency as fewer neutrals are present
in the discharge chamber. The ion and electron convection losses to the wall also increase at higher
mass utilization efficiencies because the neutral density is decreasing, which increases the electron
temperature, raises the plasma potential and thereby increases the energy lost per electron and ion.
Many thruster design concepts use electron confinement to improve the efficiency. The impact of
this can be examined in this ideal thruster model by reducing the anode area Aa. Figure 5-7 shows
the four energy-loss mechanisms for the same idealized thruster example just used, but with the
effective anode area collecting electrons decreased from the screen collection area to only 1 cm2.
By conservation of charge, electrons in this discharge are lost at the same rate as ions, so electron
confinement does not change the number or rate of electrons lost. The reduced anode area reduces
the discharge loss to below 60 eV/ion because of changes the plasma potential relative to the poten-
tial of the area that electrons are lost (the anode) to maintain charge balance, as seen from exam-
ining Eq. 5.2-11. This effect is clearly seen by comparing Figs. 5-6 and 5-7, where the energy loss
rates for ionization and excitation have not changed with the better electron confinement, but the
energy convected out of the plasma in the form of ion and electron power to the boundaries has
decreased. This is because the plasma potential described by the last term in Eq. 5.2-14 is reduced
because of the smaller anode area, which reduces the ion and electron energy loss channels. This is
the fundamental mechanism for making efficiency improvements (reducing the discharge loss) in
plasma generators.
The idealized thruster description illustrates that the power that must be provided to produce the
plasma in a thruster is large compared to that required for ionization. In terms of the total thruster

efficiency, this is the majority of the “other” power in Po in Eq. 2.5-1. In reality, the discharge loss is
significantly higher than that found in this idealized example due to imperfect confinement of the
ions and electrons in the thruster, and due to other loss mechanisms to be described below.
Finally, in most ion thrusters, such as electron bombardment thrusters and microwave-heated
Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) thrusters, the electron distribution function is non-
Maxwellian. The higher energy electrons observed in electron bombardment thrusters are often
called primaries, and they have been found to be either monoenergetic or have some distribu-
tion in energies depending on the plasma generator design. Primary electrons have a larger ion
to excited-neutral production rate than the plasma electrons due to their higher energy, and so
even small percentages of primaries in the plasma can dominate the ionization rate. The inclu-
sion of ionization by primary electrons in particle and energy balance models such as the one
just described tends to reduce the discharge loss significantly.
5.3
DC Discharge Ion Thrusters
Ion thrusters that use a DC electron-discharge plasma generator employ a hollow cathode electron
source and an anode potential discharge chamber with magnetic multipole boundaries to generate
the plasma and improve the ionization efficiency. Electrons extracted from the hollow cathode are
injected into the discharge chamber and ionize the propellant gas introduced in the chamber. Mag-
netic fields applied in the discharge chamber provide confinement primarily of the energetic elec-
trons, which increases the electron path length prior to their being lost to the anode and improves
the ionization efficiency. The ions from this plasma that flow to the grids are extracted and accel-
erated to form the beam.
Empirical studies over the past 50 years have investigated the optimal design of the magnetic field
to confine electrons and ions in thrusters. Figure 5-8 shows the evolution of the discharge chamber
geometry and magnetic field shape employed in efforts primarily aimed at improving the

confinement of energetic electrons injected into the chamber from thermionic cathodes to more
efficiently produce the plasma. Early thrusters pioneered by Kaufman utilized a solenoidal [1]
or mildly divergent magnetic field [2] shown in (a), which requires that electrons from the on-axis
thermionic filament cathode undergo collisions in order to diffuse to the anode and complete the
discharge circuit. A strongly divergent magnetic field thruster [3], shown in (b), improved the pri-
mary electron uniformity in the plasma volume and resulted in a lower discharge loss and a more
uniform beam profile. This thruster introduced a baffle in front of the hollow cathode electron
source to further inhibit on-axis electrons. The radial magnetic field thruster [4], shown in (c), pro-
duced very uniform plasmas and good efficiencies, as did a cusp version of the divergent magnetic-
field thruster shown in (d). The use of permanent magnet, multipole boundaries, first reported by
Moore [5], created essentially a field free region in the center of the thruster that produced uniform
plasmas. The magnets in various versions of this concept were oriented in rings or in axial lines to
provide plasma confinement. Moore biased the wall and magnets at cathode potential and placed
the anodes inside the cusp fields, as shown in (e), to require that electrons diffuse across the field
lines by collisions or turbulent transport before being lost. The permanent magnet ring-cusp
thruster of Sovey [6] is shown in (f ), which has become the most widely used thruster design
to date.

5.3 DC Discharge Ion Thrusters

The divergent field Kaufman ion thruster matured in the 1970s with the development of 30-cm
mercury thrusters [7, 8]. Kaufman thrusters are described in more detail in Section 5.4. Concerns
with using mercury as the propellant resulted in the development of xenon ion thrusters [9, 10],
which emerged at the same time as the benefits of ring-cusp confinement geometries became appar-
ent [6, 11, 12]. The design and development of the NSTAR [13] and Xenon Ion Propulsion (XIPS)
[14] flight thrusters in the 1990s was based on this early work. At this time, only two of these mag-
netic field geometries are still used in DC ion thrusters: the multipole magnetic field ring-cusp
thrusters and the divergent solenoidal magnetic fields in Kaufman-type thrusters. Ring-cusp thrus-
ters use alternating polarity permanent magnet rings placed around the anode-potential thruster
body. Energetic electrons are injected along a weak diverging magnetic field at the cathode and
demagnetize sufficiently to bounce from the surface magnetic fields until they either lose their
energy by collisions or find a magnetic cusp to be lost to the anode. Kaufman thrusters inject ener-
getic electrons along a strong diverging solenoidal magnetic field with the pole-pieces typically at
cathode potential, and rely on cross-field diffusion of the electrons to an anode electrode placed
near the cylindrical wall to produce ionization and create a stable discharge.
5.3.1
Generalized 0-D Ring-Cusp Ion Thruster Model
The idealized plasma generator model developed in Section 5.2 is useful in describing how the dis-
charge produces the plasma, but neglects many of the particle flows and energy transport mechan-
isms found in actual thrusters. The complete particle flows in a thruster discharge chamber are
shown in Fig. 5-9. The primary electron current emitted by the hollow cathode, Ie, generates ions

and plasma electrons. The ions flow to the accelerator structure (Is), to the anode wall (Iia) and back
to the cathode (Ik). Some fraction of the primary electrons is lost directly to the anode at the mag-
netic cusp (IL). The plasma electrons are also predominately lost to the anode at the cusp (Ia), with
only a very small fraction lost across the transverse magnetic field between the cusps corresponding
to the ambipolar current flows in this region.
The particle energies are determined by the potential distribution in the thruster. Figure 5-9 also
schematically shows the potential in the plasma chamber. Electrons from the plasma inside the
hollow cathode at a potential Vc are extracted through the orifice and into the discharge chamber
where they gain energy by passing through the potential Vk = Vd – Vc + Vp + ϕs = Vd – Vc + ϕ,
where Vp is the potential drop in the plasma presheath region and ϕs is the anode sheath potential.
Some of these electrons cause ionization near the hollow cathode exit, which produces a higher
plasma density locally near the cathode exit that must be dispersed before reaching the grid region
in order to produce the desired uniform plasma profile across the grids. The potential drop Vp in the
plasma, which is assumed to be uniform and quasi-neutral, can be reasonably approximated as
kTe/2e from the pre-sheath potential in the nearly collisionless plasma. Ions leaving the plasma
then gain the energy εi = kTe/2e + ϕs = ϕ, which was given in Eq. 5.2-10. Electrons in the tail
of the Maxwellian distribution overcome the anode sheath and are collected by the anode at
the cusps, where they remove an energy per particle of εe = (2kTe/e + ϕ), which is given by
Eq. 5.2-9 and derived in Appendix C.
Analytic models of the discharge chamber performance in ion thrusters have been described in
the literature for many years [15–17]. The first comprehensive model of the discharge chamber per-
formance using particle and energy balance equations in ring-cusp thrusters was developed by Bro-
phy and Wilbur [18, 19] in 1984. In this model, volume averaged particle and energy balance
equations including primary electrons were used to derive expressions for the discharge loss as
a function of the mass utilization efficiency in the thruster. Brophy’s model was extended by Goebel
[20, 21] to include electrostatic ion confinement, primary confinement and thermalization, the
anode sheath [22] and hollow cathode effects. This model utilizes magnetic field parameters
obtained from a magnetic field solver that accurately models the magnetic boundary. Since the
model assumes a uniform plasma in the volume inside the magnetic confinement in the discharge
chamber, it is sometimes called a zero-dimensional or 0-D discharge chamber model.
The 0-D discharge chamber model to be described here [21] self-consistently calculates the neu-
tral gas density, electron temperature, the primary electron density, plasma density, plasma poten-
tial, discharge current and the ion fluxes to the boundaries of the discharge chamber. Although the
assumption of uniform plasma is not particularly accurate near the cathode plume, the majority of
the plasma in the discharge chamber is relatively uniform and the model predictions agree well
with experimental results. The 0–D model is used to solve for the discharge loss as a function of
the mass utilization efficiency, which is useful in plotting performance curves that best characterize
the discharge chamber performance.
The particle flows and potential distribution in the thruster used in the 0-D model are shown
schematically in Fig. 5-9. Mono-energetic primary electrons with a current Ie are assumed to be
emitted from the hollow cathode orifice into the discharge chamber where they ionize the back-
ground gas to produce a uniform plasma. Electrons produced in the ionization process and primary
electrons that have thermalized with the plasma electrons create a Maxwellian plasma electron
population that also contributes to the ionization. Owing to the relatively high magnetic field pro-
duced by the magnets near the wall, the electron Larmor radius is much smaller than the dimen-
sions of the discharge chamber and both primary and plasma electrons are considered to be
reflected from the boundary region between the magnetic cusps. The primary and plasma electrons
5.3 DC Discharge Ion Thrusters

can be lost at the magnetic cusps because the magnetic field lines are essentially perpendicular to
the surface. The number of electrons lost at the cusp depends on the local sheath potential and the
effective loss area at the cusp. Ions produced in the discharge chamber can flow back to the hollow
cathode, to the anode wall or to the plane of the accelerator. At the accelerator, these ions are either
intercepted and collected by the screen electrode with an effective transparency Tg, or are extracted
from the plasma through the grids to become beam ions. The screen grid transparency depends on
the optical transparency of the grid and the penetration of the high voltage fields from the accel-
erator region into the screen apertures. Although this transparency is an input to the discharge
model, it is calculated by the ion optics codes described in Chapter 6.
In this model, the high voltage power supply that accelerates the ions, called the screen supply, is
connected to the anode. This means that the ions fall from the average plasma potential in the dis-
charge chamber to form the beam. It is also possible to connect the screen supply to the screen and
cathode, which means that the ion current in the beam must pass through the discharge supply.
This changes the algebra slightly in calculating the discharge performance, but it does not change
the results. The components of particle and energy balance model are described in the following
sections.
5.3.2
Magnetic Multipole Boundaries
Ring-cusp ion thrusters use alternating polarity permanent magnet rings oriented perpendicular to
the thruster axis, with the number of rings selected and optimized for different size thrusters [20].
This configuration provides magnetic confinement of the electrons with finite loss at the magnetic
cusps, and electrostatic confinement of the ions from the anode wall due to the quasi-ambipolar
potentials at the boundary from the transverse magnetic fields. Line-cusp thrusters also use high
field magnets, but the magnets are configured in alternating polarity axial lines that run along the
chamber wall. Asymmetries at the ends of the line cusps cause plasma losses and difficulties in
producing a uniform symmetric field at the cathode exit, which adversely affects the electron con-
finement and thruster efficiency. Ring-cusp thrusters are the most commonly used discharge cham-
ber design at this time due to their ability to produce high efficiency and uniform plasmas at the ion
accelerator surface if properly designed.
A schematic representation of a section of a ring cusp magnetic multipole boundary is shown in
Fig. 5-10. In this view, a cut along the axis through a six-ring boundary at the wall is made, leaving
the ends of the alternating magnets visible. The magnetic field lines terminate at the magnet face,
resulting in a cusp magnetic field with field lines perpendicular to the wall at the magnet. Electrons

that are incident in this area will be either reflected by the magnetic mirror, electrostatically
repelled by the sheath potential, or lost directly to the anode. Electrons that are incident between
the cusps encounter a transverse magnetic field and are reflected from the boundary. The contours
of constant magnetic field shown on the right in Fig. 5-10 illustrate that the total field is essentially
constant across the boundary at a distance sufficiently above the magnets, although the component
of the field is changing from purely perpendicular at the cusp to purely parallel between the cusps.
An analysis of the magnetic field strength for various multipole boundaries was published by
Forrester [23] and discussed by Lieberman [24]. Since the divergence of the magnetic field is zero,
the field satisfies Laplace’s Equation and the solution for the lowest order mode at a distance from
the magnets greater than the magnet separation can be expressed by a Fourier series. This gives a
magnetic field strength above the magnet array described by
By x, y = πwBo
2d

d
e −πy d,
5 3-1
where Bo is the magnetic field at the surface of the magnet, d is the distance between the magnet
centers, w is the magnet width and the y-direction is perpendicular to the wall in Fig. 5-10. Owing to
the localized magnet positions, the field has the periodic cosine behavior along the surface of the
wall illustrated in the figure. In addition, the magnetic field decreases exponentially away from the
wall all along the boundary.
At the cusp, the field actually decreases as 1/d2 due to the dipole nature of the permanent magnet.
This rapid decrease in the field moving away from the magnet illustrates the importance of placing
the magnets as close to the plasma as possible to maximize the field strength inside the discharge
chamber for a given magnet size to provide sufficient field strength for primary and secondary elec-
tron confinement at the wall. Between the cusps, the dipole characteristics of the local field forces
the field lines to wrap back around the magnets, which causes the magnetic field strength to have a
maximum at a distance y = 0.29∗d from the wall, which will be derived in Section 5.3.4. The trans-
verse maximum field strength produced between the cusps is important to provide electron and ion
confinement, which improves the thruster efficiency.
Although analytic solutions to the magnetic field provide insight into the field structure, the
availability of commercial computer codes to calculate the fields accurately makes it much simpler
to model the entire ring-cusp field. For example, Fig. 5-11 shows the contours of constant magnetic
field measured and calculated using Maxwell 3-D magnetic field solver [25] for the NEXIS ion
thruster [20] with six ring cusps. The measured and calculated values are within the measurement
error. This type of plot shows clearly the localized surface-field characteristic of magnetic multipole
boundaries, which leaves the majority of the inner volume essentially magnetic field free. A large
field free region design significantly enhances the plasma uniformity and ion current density pro-
file [20, 26]. In this case, the 60-G magnetic field contour is closed throughout the inside surface of
the thruster, which will be shown in the next section to provide good plasma confinement at
the wall.
5.3.3
Electron Confinement
The primary electrons are injected into the discharge chamber from the hollow cathode. The dis-
charge chamber can be viewed as a volume with reflecting boundaries and discrete loss areas for the
electrons at the cusps where the magnetic fields lines are nearly perpendicular to the surface. The
primary electrons then effectively bounce around in the chamber until they are either lost directly
to the anode wall by encountering the finite loss area at the cusps, make an ionization or excitation

collision, or are thermalized by Coulomb interactions with the plasma electrons. The primary cur-
rent lost directly to the anode cusps is given by
IL = npe υpAp,
5 3-2
where np is the primary electron density, υp is the primary electron velocity, and Ap is the loss area
for the primaries.
The loss area for primary electrons at the cusp [27] is given by
Ap = 2rpLc = 2
B
2mV p
e
Lc,
5 3-3
where rp is the primary electron Larmor radius, B is the magnetic field strength at the cusp at the
anode wall, Vp is the primary electron energy, e is the electron charge, and Lc is the total length of
the magnetic cusps (sum of the length of the cusps).
Using a simple probabilistic analysis, the mean primary electron confinement time can be esti-
mated by
τp =
V
υp Ap
,
5 3-4
where V is the volume of the discharge chamber. The mean primary electron path length prior to
finding a cusp and being lost to the wall is L = υp∗τp. Likewise, the ionization mean free path is
λ = 1/noσ where σ represents the total inelastic collision cross section for the primary electrons.
The probability that a primary electron will make a collision and not be directly lost to the anode
is then
P = 1 −e −noσL
= 1 −e −noσV Ap
5 3-5
By providing strong magnetic field strengths at the cusp to minimize the primary loss area, the
probability of a primary electron being lost directly to the anode can be made very small. Similarly,
ion thrusters with large volumes and/or operated at higher internal gas densities will cause the

primary electrons to undergo collisions and thermalization before being lost directly to the anode.
Minimizing the energy loss associated with primaries being lost before making a collision in this
way serves to maximize the efficiency of the thruster.
An example of the probability of a primary electron making a collision before finding a cusp is
shown in Fig. 5-12 for the case of the NEXIS thruster designed with either four or six cusps [20]. For
the design with six cusps, it is necessary to have cusp field strengths approaching 2000 G at the sur-
face of the anode in order to minimize primary loss because the longer length of the cusp increases
the loss area. Designs with a smaller number of ring cusps, corresponding to a smaller primary
anode collection area from Eq. 5.3-3, require less magnetic field strength to achieve the same ben-
efit. However, it will be shown later that the number of cusps affects efficiency and uniformity, and
that maximizing the probability of a primary making a collision before being lost is only one of the
trade-offs in designing an ion thruster.
Since the primary electron current lost directly to the anode is generally minimized for best effi-
ciency, the discharge current is carried to the anode mainly by the plasma electrons. The plasma
electrons are almost exclusively lost at the magnetic cusps, but their motion is affected by the pres-
ence of ions that also penetrate the cusp. Therefore, ions and plasma electrons are lost to a hybrid
anode area [27] at the cusp given by
Aa = 4rhLc = 4

The plasma in the discharge chamber obeys particle conservation in that the current injected and
produced in the discharge must equal the total current that leaves the discharge:
Iinjected + Iproduced =
Iout
5 3-8
The current injected into the discharge volume is the primary electron current, and the current
produced is the ion and electron pairs from each ionization collision. The current lost to the anode
is the sum of the direct primary loss, the plasma electron loss, and a fraction of the ion loss. There is
also ion current lost to cathode potential surfaces and the accelerator structure from the balance of
the ions produced in the discharge. The plasma potential will adjust itself such that the total elec-
tron current to the anode is equal to the total ion current out of the discharge. It will be shown in the
following sections that changing the anode area via the magnet strength or number of magnet rings
will change the plasma potential relative to the anode (primarily the anode sheath voltage), which
affects both the energy loss though the sheath and the stability of the discharge.
5.3.4
Ion Confinement at the Anode Wall
Ions are typically unmagnetized in ion thruster discharge chambers because the magnetic field is
relatively low throughout the bulk of the discharge chamber, which results in a large ion Larmor
radius compared to the thruster dimensions. For an unmagnetized plasma, the ion current flowing
out the plasma volume in any direction is given by Eq. 3.7-30, which is the Bohm current:
Ii = 1
2 nie
kTe
M A,
5 3-9
where ni is the ion density in the center of the discharge and A is the total ion loss area. The Bohm
current also describes ion flow along magnetic field lines, which will be useful later in discussing
other plasma generator types.
The electrons may or may not be magnetized in the main discharge chamber volume, but they are
strongly affected by the magnetic fields near the boundary in ring-cusp thrusters. The magnetized
electrons then influence the ion motion near the boundaries by electrostatic effects. This causes the
ion loss to the cusps to be the Bohm current to the hybrid area, given by Eq. 5.3-6, and a reduction in
the Bohm current to the wall area between the cusps due to the ambipolar potentials that develop
there. Since the cusp area is small compared to the rest of the anode surface area facing the plasma,
the ion current to the hybrid cusp area can often be neglected. However, between the cusps the loss
area is significant, and it is possible to analyze the electron and ion transport across the magnetic
field to calculate the reduction in the ion velocity caused by the reduced transverse electron drift
speed. This is then used to calculate the rate of ion loss to the anode compared to the unmagnetized
Bohm current to the walls.
Ring-cusp thrusters are designed with various numbers of rings, distances between the rings, and
magnet sizes that determine the magnetic field strength in the discharge chamber transverse to the
wall. The quasi-neutral plasma flow across this magnetic field to the wall is described by the dif-
fusion equation with an ambipolar diffusion coefficient. Ambipolar diffusion across a magnetic
field was analyzed in Section 3.6.3.2. The transverse ion velocity was found to be

5 3-10
Setting the transverse electric field E in the plasma to zero in Eq. 5.3-10 gives the case where the ambi-
polar electric field exactly cancels the pre-sheath electric field that normally accelerates the ions to the
170
5 Ion Thruster Plasma Generators

Bohm velocity. In this case, the ion velocity is just the ion thermal velocity
≈
kTi M , and the
value of the magnetic field B in Eq. 5.3-10 is the minimum transverse magnetic field required to
reduce the electron mobility sufficiently to produce this effect. The flux of ions passing through
the transverse magnetic field is greatly reduced compared to the Bohm current due to the smaller
ion velocity. The ion flux that does reach the wall is finally accelerated to the Bohm velocity close to
the anode wall to satisfy the sheath criterion. Ions are conserved in this model because ions that are
inhibited from flowing to the anode wall due to the transverse fields instead flow axially toward the
grids where there is no confinement.
However, it is not necessary to limit this analysis to the case of E = 0. If the magnetic field is
smaller than the critical B that causes E = 0, then the transverse electron mobility increases and
a finite electric field exists in the magnetic diffusion length l. The ions fall through whatever poten-
tial difference is set up by this electric field, which means that the ions are accelerated to an energy
given by
1
2 M υ2
i = eE l
5 3-11
The ambipolar flow in the transverse magnetic field changes the electric field magnitude in the pre-
sheath region and reduces the acceleration of the ions toward the wall.
However, in the limit of unmagnetized ions (the case for all ion thrusters), the electric field near
the sheath edge must accelerate the ions to the Bohm velocity entering the sheath. This results in a
net electric field in the plasma edge (the ambipolar flow and pre-sheath regions) limited to
E = −Mυ2
i
el
5 3-12
Note that the electric field sign must be negative for the ion flow in the ambipolar diffusion region.

where ν = νe/νei, and kTe∇n/en is approximately (kTe/e)l for l representing the length the ions travel
radially in the transverse magnetic field between the cusps. The value of l can be estimated from
calculations of the transverse magnetic field versus the distance from the wall to the peak transverse
field between the cusps (shown below), and is usually on the order of 2–3 cm.
Alternatively, the modified electric field given in Eq. 5.3-12 can be inserted into Eq. 5.3-10 to pro-
duce an expression for the ion velocity:

The collision frequencies (νe = νen + νei and ν = νe/νei) in these equations were given in Chapter 3,
where the electron-neutral collision frequency is given in Eq. 3.6-12, and the electron-ion collision
frequency is given in Eq. 3.6-14. It is possible to show that in the limit that B goes to zero and the
flow is essentially collisionless, Eq. 5.3-15 reverts to the Bohm velocity.
Defining an ion confinement factor

5 3-16
and since the Bohm velocity is υBohm =
kTe M, it is a simple matter to calculate the reduction in
the expected flux of ions going to the anode due to the reduction in the Bohm velocity at a given
magnetic field strength B. The ion current transverse to the magnetic field between the cusps to the
anode is then given by
Iia = 1
2 ni e

M Aas f c,
5 3-17
where Aas is the total surface area of the anode exposed to the plasma.
There are two issues with using Eq. 5.3-17 to evaluate ion loss rate reduction between the cusps.
First, the magnetic field in the ring-cusp geometry is not transverse to the wall everywhere. Near
the cusp shown in Fig. 5-10, the field transitions from parallel to perpendicular to the wall where
the analysis above does not apply. However, the magnetic field strength in this region increases
rapidly near the magnets and some fraction of the plasma electrons are reflected from the mag-
netic mirror. This serves to retard the ion flux electrostatically in a manner similar to the ambi-
polar diffusion case between the cusps described above. Ultimately, the ions are lost at the cusp at
the Bohm current to the hybrid area, and it is usually found that the transition to this unimpeded
ion flow to the wall occurs over an area that is small compared to the total area between the cusps.
The second issue with using Eq. 5.3-17 is that the diffusion thickness l is not known. However,
this can be estimated for ring-cusp thrusters using a dipole model for the magnets. Consider the
case of two rows of opposite polarity magnets, which is illustrated in part of Fig. 5-10. Each magnet
has a dipole strength M per unit length and the magnets are separated in the x-direction by a dis-
tance d. The magnetic field along the line perpendicular to the midline between the magnets is

r =

5 3-18
where r is the length of the line from the point on the midline to the magnet, q is the number of
magnetic dipoles and δ is the half height of the magnet. The magnetic field on the centerline
between the magnets has only an x-component. The x-component of the field from one magnet
(positive polarity) is given by

5 3-22
It is assumed that the diffusion length l is roughly this distance. This is not an unreasonable approx-
imation, as illustrated in Fig. 5-13. The magnetic field decreases on each side of the maximum, but is
nearly the full value over the length of about 0.3 of the distance between the magnets.
The maximum transverse field strength along the centerline between the magnets, often called
the “saddle-point” field, can also be calculated from this simple derivation. Using Eq. 5.3-22 in
Eq. 5.3-21, the maximum magnetic field is
B ymax = 5 2 M

5 3-23
The dipole strength per unit length is

where Br is the residual magnetic field of the magnet, Vm is the volume of the magnet, and w is the
width of the magnet. For example, for two rows of magnets that have a residual magnetic field of
10,000 G, a volume per width of 0.6 cm2 and a separation of 10 cm, the maximum transverse mag-
netic field is 24.8 G and occurs at a distance of 2.9 cm above the boundary.

As an example of the ion loss rate to the anode, the fraction of the Bohm current to the anode (Iia/
IBohm) is plotted in Fig. 5-14 as a function of the magnetic field at the saddle point for the NSTAR ion
thruster [13]. At zero transverse magnetic field, the ion flux to the anode is the Bohm current. As the
transverse field increases and reduces the electron mobility, the ions are slowed and the current lost
decreases. In the NSTAR design, the last closed magnetic contour is about 20 G, and so roughly half
of the ions initially headed radially toward the anode are lost. For closed magnetic field contours of
at least about 50 G, the ion loss to the anode is reduced by nearly a factor of ten compared to the
unmagnetized Bohm current. This can make a significant difference in the efficiency of the plasma
generator and the amount of discharge power required to produce the beam ions. Even though the
ions are unmagnetized in these thrusters, it is clear that ambipolar effects make the ring-cusp mag-
netic fields effective in reducing the ion loss to the walls.
5.3.5
Neutral and Primary Densities in the Discharge Chamber
The ion and excited neutral production rates described by Eqs. 5.3-25 and 5.3-26 require knowledge
of the neutral gas density in the discharge chamber. The neutral gas flow that escapes the chamber
(the unionized propellant) is simply the gas injected into the discharge chamber minus the gas par-
ticles that are ionized and extracted to form the ion beam:
Qout = Qin −Ib

5 3-25
The neutral gas that leaks through the grid is the neutral flux on the grids (in particles per second)
times the grid optical transparency Ta and a conductance reduction term ηc known as the Clausing
factor [28]:
Qout = 1

where υo is the neutral gas velocity, Ag is the grid area and ηc is the Clausing factor. The Clausing

Clausing’s original work on gas flow restriction in short tubes. For typical grid apertures with small
thickness to length ratios, the Clausing factor must be calculated using Monte Carlo techniques, an
example of which is given in Appendix G. In general, ion thruster grids will have Clausing factors
on the order of 0.5.
The mass utilization efficiency of the thruster discharge chamber is defined as

Flow is usually given in standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm) or milligrams per sec (mg/s),
and conversions from these units to number of atoms per second useful in Eq. 5.3-28 are given in
Appendix B. The neutral pressure in the discharge chamber during operation of the thruster can
also be found using this expression and the conversion from density to pressure given in Eq. 2.7-2, if
the neutral gas temperature is known. In general, the neutral gas atoms collide with the anode wall
and grids several times before being lost, and so the neutral gas can be assumed to have the average
temperature of the thruster body in contact with the plasma. This temperature typically ranges from
200 to 300 C for operating thrusters.
5.3.6
Ion and Excited Neutral Production
Ions in the discharge chamber are produced by both the primary electrons and by the tail of the
Maxwellian distribution of the plasma electrons. The total number of ions produced in
the discharge, expressed as a current in Coulombs per second, is given by
Ip = nonee σiυe V + nonpe σiυp V,
5 3-29
where no is the neutral atom density, ne is the plasma electron density, σI is the ionization cross
section, υe is the plasma electron velocity, V is the plasma volume inside the discharge chamber,
np is the primary electron density, and υp is the primary electron velocity. The terms in the brackets
are the ionization cross section averaged over the distribution of primary and Maxwellian electron
energies, which is usually called the reaction rate coefficient.
An example of ionization and excitation cross sections [29, 30] used for electron impact on
xenon is shown in Fig. 5-15. If it is assumed that the primary electrons are monoenergetic,
then the reaction rate coefficient in Eq. 5.3-29 for primary ionization is just the cross
section in Fig. 5-15 times the corresponding primary electron velocity. This data is listed for xenon
and krypton in Appendix D. If the primaries have a distribution in energy, then the cross
section must be averaged over that distribution. For Maxwellian electrons, this is calculated
for xenon and krypton and listed in Appendix E.
Excited neutrals are also produced by both the primary electrons and the tail of the Maxwellian
distribution of the plasma electrons. The total number of exited neutrals produced in the discharge
in Coulombs per second is given by
I∗= nonee σ∗υe V + nonpe σ∗υp V,
5 3-30
where σ∗is the excitation cross section. Again, the excitation cross section is averaged over the dis-
tribution in electron energies to produce the reaction rate coefficients in the brackets. The reaction
5.3 DC Discharge Ion Thrusters
175

rate coefficients calculated by averaging the ionization and excitation cross sections over the Max-
wellian energy distribution are shown in Fig. 5-16 for xenon, and are listed in Appendix E. The rate
of excitation is seen to exceed that of ionization for low electron temperatures (below about 9 eV).
The ratio of excitation to ionization reaction rates for xenon is shown in Fig. 5-4. As previously
described, at low electron temperatures, a significant amount of the energy in the discharge goes
into excitation of the neutrals at the expense of ionization. This is one of the many reasons that the
cost of producing an ion in ion thrusters is usually over ten times the ionization potential.
For inert gas propellants commonly used in ion thrusters, the second ionization potential is on
the order of twice the first ionization potential. For example, the first ionization potential of xenon
is 12.13 eV and the second ionization potential is 21.2 eV. DC electron discharges that have electron

energies in excess of 21.2 V can produce a significant number of double ions. In addition, the tail of
the Maxwellian electron distribution will also contain electrons with an energy that exceeds the
second ionization potential, and significant numbers of double ions will be produced if the electron
temperature in the discharge chamber is high.
The generation rate of double ions is determined in the same manner as single ions shown above

Electron Temperature

of the ions in the discharge chamber, where the number of ions generated must equal the total
current flux of ions to the boundaries. The singly ionized propellant atoms generated are described

by Eq. 5.3-29. Doubly ionized propellant atoms generated primarily by a second ionization of pro-

where again Aas is the anode wall area and As is the screen grid area. Separating all the terms

where Eq. 5.3-28 has been used for the neutral gas density no expressed in terms of the mass uti-
lization efficiency in this equation.
If the total propellant flow into the discharge chamber and the mass utilization efficiency are
specified, and the primary electron density calculated as described below, then Eq. 5.3-40 can be
solved for the electron temperature. This is because the ionization reaction rate coefficient is a func-
tion of the electron temperature. Alternatively, if the beam current is specified, then the right-hand
side of Eq. 5.3-28 can also be used for the neutral density in Eq. 5.3-40 to find the electron temper-
ature. Typically, curve fits to the ionization and excitation cross section and reaction rate data
shown in Figs. 5-14 and 5-15 are used to evaluate the reaction rate coefficients in a program that
iteratively solves Eq. 5.3-40 for the electron temperature.
5.3.8
Primary Electron Density
The primary electron density in Eq. 5.3-40 can be evaluated from the total primary electron con-
finement time in the discharge chamber. The emitted current Ie from the hollow cathode is
Ie = np e V
τt
,
5 3-42
178
5 Ion Thruster Plasma Generators

where τt is the total primary confinement time that addresses all of the primary electron thermal-
ization and loss mechanisms. The ballistic confinement time for direct primary loss to the anode, τp,
was given in Eq. 5.3-4. It is assumed that the primary electrons have undergone an inelastic colli-
sion with the neutral gas and have lost sufficient energy such that they are then rapidly thermalized
with the plasma electrons. The mean time for a collision between the primary and a neutral gas
atom to occur is given by
τc =

5 3-43
where σ is the total inelastic collision cross section. Using Eq. 5.3-28 for the neutral density, the
mean collision time for primary electrons is
τc =

5 3-44
Finally, primary electrons can also be thermalized by equilibrating with the plasma electrons. The
time for primary electrons to slow into a Maxwellian electron population was derived by Spitzer
[32] and is given by
τs =

5 3-45
where w =

m 2kTe is the inverse most probable
speed of the Maxwellian electrons, AD is a diffusion constant given by
AD = 8πe4ne lnΛ
m2
,
5 3-46
and lnΛ is the collisionality parameter [33] given in Eq. 3.6-15. The function G(lfω) is defined in
Appendix F and a curve fit to Spitzer’s tabulated values (in CGS units) for this function is provided.
The total primary electron confinement time can be found from

Some care needs to be used in including the Spitzer slowing time because some ion thruster designs
have a very non-monoenergetic primary energy distribution, which is not described well by Eq. 5.3-
45. The Spitzer equilibration time must then be used in Eq. 5.3-47 if the electron distributions are
Maxwellian.
The current emitted from the hollow cathode is
Ie = Id −Is −Ik,
5 3-48
where Is is the screen current and Ik is the ion current back to the cathode. Using Eqs. 5.3-4 and
5.3-44, in Eq. 5.3-42, the primary electron density is given by

Assuming that the primary electron loss directly to the anode is negligible, the electron equilibra-

This equation demonstrates the characteristic behavior of the primary electron density being pro-
portional to the mass utilization efficiency divided by one minus the mass utilization efficiency that
was originally described by Brophy [18, 19]. This dependence is valid unless there are paths for the
primary electrons to be lost other than just collisionally with the neutral gas, such as ballistic flow to
the anode or by thermalization with the plasma electrons. The behavior of the primary electron
density with changes in the mass utilization efficiency is shown in Fig. 5-17, where the primary
electron density is normalized to the value at ηmd = 0. As the neutral density decreases in the dis-
charge chamber at higher mass utilization efficiencies, the primary electron density increases rap-
idly. At 90% mass utilization efficiency, the primary electron density in the discharge chamber is
nine times higher than at 50% mass utilization efficiency. This strongly affects the ionization rate
and the discharge loss behavior with neutral gas pressure, which will be shown later.
5.3.9
Power and Energy Balance in the Discharge Chamber
The currents and potential distributions in the ring-cusp thruster discharge were shown in Fig. 5-9.
The power into the discharge chamber is the emitted current from the hollow cathode multiplied by
the voltage the electrons gain in the discharge chamber (Vk in Fig. 5-9):
Pin = IeV k = Ie Vd −Vc + Vp + ϕs = Ie Vd −Vc + ϕ + 5
2 Tc ,
5 3-51
where Vd is the discharge voltage, Vc is the cathode voltage drop, Vp is the potential drop in the
plasma, ϕ is the sum of the pre-sheath and anode sheath potentials relative to the anode wall,
and the last term is the convected energy out of the insert-plasma inside the cathode from the cath-
ode electron temperature Tc. The power into the discharge is transferred from the primary electrons
from the cathode into producing ions, excited neutrals and Maxwellian electrons. The power leav-
ing the discharge to the electrodes is from ions flowing to the anode, cathode and screen plane, and

from primary and plasma electrons flowing to the anode. The power out of the discharge is then the
sum of these terms given by:
Pout = IpU + + I∗U∗+ Is + Ik
Vd + ϕ
+ Ib + Iia
Vp + ϕs + Iaεe + IL Vd −Vc
,
5 3-52
where Ip is the total current of ions produced in the discharge, U+ is the ionization potential of the
propellant gas, I∗is the current of excited ions produced in the discharge chamber, U∗is the exci-
tation energy, Is is the current of ions to the screen plane, Ik is the current of ions flowing back to the
cathode, Ib is the beam current, Ia is the plasma electron current to the anode, Iia is the ion current to
the anode, and IL is the primary electron fraction that falls from the plasma potential to be lost to the
anode. The plasma electron energy lost to the anode wall, εe, is equal to 2kTe/e + ϕ, which is derived
in Appendix C. The ions fall through the pre-sheath potential from the center of the plasma to the
sheath edge, such that Vp can be approximated as kTe/2e. The ion energy to the anode, εi, is then
kTe/2e + ϕs = ϕ, which was given in Eq. 5.2-10.
With the screen grid connected to the cathode potential, the current emitted from the hollow
cathode was given in Eq. 5.3-48 in terms of the other currents in the circuit. Likewise, conservation
of particles flowing to the anode gives
Ia = Id + Iia −IL,
5 3-53
where Id is the discharge current measured in the discharge power supply. Equating the power into
the discharge to the power out, using the particle balance equations in 5.3-48 and 5.3-53, and sol-
ving for the beam current from the thruster gives:
Ib = Id Vd −Vc + 2TeV −IpU + −I∗U∗−Is + Ik
2V d −Vc + 2ϕ
ϕ
−Iia 2TeV + 2ϕ + IL Vd −Vc −2TeV −ϕ

5 3-54
where TeV is the electron temperature in electron volts.
The issue in evaluating Eq. 5.3-54 for the beam current produced by a given thruster design is that
several of the current terms in the numerator contain the plasma density, which is not known. In
addition, the beam current Ib is given by the Bohm current averaged over the screen-grid plane
times the effective transparency Ts of the screen grid:
Ib ≈1

M AsTs,
5 3-55
where ni is the peak ion density at the screen grid, υa is the ion acoustic velocity, As is the screen grid

The screen grid current in Eq. 5.3-54 is given by
Is =
1 −Ts
2
nie υaAs
5 3-56
and the ion current to the anode is given by Eq. 5.3-17 and the primary electron loss to the anode is
given by Eq. 5.3-2. The ion plasma density ni in these equations is the sum of the plasma electron
and primary electron densities: ni = ne + np. It is often assumed that the primary electron density is
small and ne ≈ni (quasi-neutrality), but the primary density can be easily included.
5.3 DC Discharge Ion Thrusters

Equations 5.3-54–5.3.56 can be solved for the plasma density:
ne =

eυaAs
2
Tsϕ + 1 + Ts
2Vd −Vc + 2TeV + f c 2TeV + 2ϕ
,
5 3-57
where the ion loss back to the cathode Ik has been ignored as small. The plasma density is found to
be proportional to the discharge current Id decreased by the amount of primary electron loss (IL)
directly to the anode. This dependence illustrates why implementing sufficient cusp magnetic field
strength to reduce the primary electron loss is critically important to the thruster performance.
Unfortunately, this equation still contains the primary electron density in the primary electron cur-
rent lost term, and so must be solved iteratively for the plasma density. Once the plasma density is
known, the beam current can be calculated from 5.65. If the flatness parameter, which is defined as
the average ion current density over the grids divided by the peak current density, is known, then
the peak plasma density and peak beam current density can be obtained. The flatness parameter is
normally found by experimental measurements of the plasma and beam profiles, or by 2-D models
of the discharge that are discussed in Section 5.7.
5.3.10
Discharge Loss
The discharge loss in an ion thruster is defined as the power into the thruster divided by the beam
current. This parameter then describes the power required to produce the beam current, which is a
good figure of merit for the discharge chamber performance. In DC-discharge thrusters, the dis-
charge loss for the plasma generator is given by
ηd = IdVd + IckVck
Ib

Ib
,
5 3-58
where Ib is the beam current, Ick is the current to the cathode keeper electrode (if any), and Vck is the
keeper bias voltage. The keeper power is typically negligible in these thrusters, but it is a simple
matter to include this small correction. Combining Eqs. 5.3-54 and 5.3-58, the discharge loss is

where TeV is in electron volts. To evaluate the first current fraction in this equation, the ions
are produced by both primary electrons and the energetic tail of the Maxwellian distribution of
the plasma electrons. The total number of ions produced in the discharge, Ip, is given in
Eq. 5.3-29, and the total number of excited neutrals produced in the discharge, I∗, is given
in Eq. 5.3-30.
Using Eqs. 5.3-29 and 5.3-30 for the particle production and excitation, Eq. 5.3-55 for the beam
current, and assuming ni ≈ne, the first current fraction in Eq. 5.3-59 is

The ion current that goes to the anode wall is, again, the Bohm current reduced by the confinement
factor fc, given in Eq. 5.3-16. In this model, the value of the confinement factor must be evaluated for
the particular ion thruster discharge chamber being analyzed. However, for most ion thruster
designs, if the 50 G contour is closed, it is possible to assume to first order that fc ≈0.1 and the
ion loss to the anode surface area is essentially one-tenth of the local Bohm current. For a given
confinement factor fc, the fourth current fraction in Eq. 5.3-59 is

Equation 5.3-65 illuminates some of the design features that improve the discharge efficiency.
Since the discharge voltage Vd appears in both the numerator and denominator of Eq. 5.3-65,
there is no strong dependence of the discharge loss on voltage shown directly in this equation.
However, increases in the discharge voltage raise the primary energy strongly, which increases
the ionization rate and beam current. Therefore, higher discharge voltages always result in lower
discharge losses. Higher screen grid transparency Ts, smaller ion confinement factor fc (better ion
confinement), and smaller primary loss area Ap and wall surface area Aas all reduce the discharge
loss. Lowering the plasma potential also reduces the discharge loss by reducing the energy lost to
the anode by the plasma electrons, which is accomplished by reducing the anode loss area at
the cusps.
5.3 DC Discharge Ion Thrusters
183

The input data required to solve Eq. 5.3-65 are:
• Discharge voltage
• Discharge chamber surface area and volume
• Magnetic field strength at the cusp
• Magnetic field closed contour strength between the cusps
• Grid area
• Grid transparency
• Gas temperature
• Cathode voltage drop
It is necessary to specify either the discharge current or the beam current to calculate the plasma
density in the discharge chamber. The grid transparency is obtained from the grid codes (often
called “optics codes”). Several of these codes, such as the JPL CEX ion optics codes [34, 35], are
described in Chapter 6. The cathode voltage drop is either measured inside the hollow cathode
[36], or calculated using a separate 2-D hollow cathode plasma model [37] that was described in
Chapter 4.
Discharge chamber behavior is characterized by “performance curves”, which were described in
Chapter 2, and are graphs of discharge loss versus mass utilization efficiency. These curves plot the
electrical cost of producing beam ions as a function of the propellant utilization efficiency, and give
useful information of how well the plasma generator works. Performance curves are normally taken
atconstantbeamcurrentanddischargevoltagesothattheefficiencyofproducinganddeliveringionsto
the beam is not masked by changes in the discharge voltage or average plasma density at the grids.
Calculating performance curves using Eq. 5.3-65 requires iteration of the solutions for the elec-
tron temperature, discharge current and/or beam current in the above equations. To measure the
discharge loss versus mass utilization in thrusters, the discharge current, total gas flow and gas flow
split between the cathode and main discharge chamber are normally varied to produce a constant
beam current and discharge voltage as the mass utilization efficiency changes. This means that a
beam current and mass utilization operating point can be specified, which determines the neutral
gas density in the discharge chamber from Eq. 5.3-28 and the average plasma density in the dis-
charge chamber from the Bohn current in Eq. 5.3-9. If an initial discharge current is then specified,
the primary electron density can be calculated from Eq. 5.3-50 and the electron temperature
obtained by finding a solution to Eqs. 5.3-40 or 5.3-41. These parameters are used to solve for
the discharge loss, which is evaluated from the given beam current, discharge voltage and discharge
loss. A program is iterated until a discharge current is found that produces the correct discharge loss
at the specified beam current.
An example of performance curves calculated using this model and compared to measured curves
for the NEXIS ion thruster [38] are shown in Fig. 5-18. The discharge loss was measured for three
different discharge voltages during operation at 4 A of beam current. The 180 eV/ion discharge loss
data at the 26.5 V discharge voltage required that the cathode produce a discharge current of 27.5 A
to generate the 4 A of ion beam current.
The discharge model also matches the discharge loss data obtained from other thrusters.
Figure 5-19 shows the discharge loss measured at JPL in a laboratory-copy of the NSTAR thruster
[39] operating at the full power (2.3 kW) TH15 throttle level. The model predictions agree with
the thruster data if the measured 6.5 V cathode voltage drop in the NSTAR hollow cathode [40] is
used for Vc. The ability of a 0-D model to match the NSTAR data is significant only in that the
NSTAR plasma is not very uniform (flatness parameter ≈0.5) and contains over 20% double
ions peaked on the axis. The 0-D model likely works in this case because the ionization is still
184
5 Ion Thruster Plasma Generators

dominated by the average volume effects, and the losses are still determined by the magnetic field
structure at the wall, which 0-D models can capture sufficiently to give reasonably accurate
results.
The shape of the performance curves is also important. As the mass utilization is increased, the
neutral density in the discharge chamber decreases (see Eq. 5.3-28) and more of the primary energy
goes into heating the plasma electrons and energy loss directly to the anode, as was illustrated by
the simplified model for the idealized thruster case in Section 5.2. Optimal thruster designs have

flatter discharge performance curves that exhibit lower discharge losses as the mass utilization effi-
ciency is increased. The model suggests that this is generally achieved in thrusters by designing for
good primary and plasma electron confinement such that the convective losses are minimized at
low neutral density and higher electron temperatures.
A significant challenge for most discharge models is handling the primary electrons correctly. For
the case of monoenergetic primaries assumed in this model, the primary density is determined by
collisional and ballistic (direct-to-anode) losses that change as a function of the neutral pressure,
which is inversely proportional to the mass utilization efficiency. The primary electron density then
varies strongly as the mass utilization efficiency is changed. However, if primary electrons are
neglected altogether (i.e., assumed thermalized immediately in the cathode plume) so that the
plasma in the discharge chamber is produced only by ionization by the high-energy tail of the Max-
wellian electron population, the discharge loss is extremely high. This is shown in Fig. 5-20, where
the discharge loss in the NEXIS thruster increases to over 240 eV/ion if the primary electron ion-
ization effects are neglected. Likewise, if the primary electron density is independent of the neutral
pressure, then the discharge loss curve in Fig. 5-20 has a steep slope resulting from an excessive
number of primary electrons at low mass utilization (high pressure) which produces more ioniza-
tion than actually occurs. Clearly, including the presence of primary electrons in the analysis is
required for the model results to agree with the data, which, in turn, suggests that primary or ener-
getic electrons and non-Maxwellian electron populations must exist in this type of thruster.
Having a representative model of the discharge permits environmental changes to the thruster to
also be understood. For example, the neutral gas temperature depends on the operating time of the
thruster until equilibrium is reached, which can take hours in some cases during which the dis-
charge loss will vary [41]. The 0-D model predictions are shown in Fig. 5-21 for three different neu-
tral gas temperatures. The discharge loss data points shown were measured for the NEXIS thruster
operating at 26.5 V and 92% mass utilization efficiency at first turn on, after 1 h, and after 10 h. In
this case, the thruster starts at essentially room temperature, and the model predicts that the dis-
charge heats the thruster and neutral gas to about 470 K after about 10 h of operation. Although

thruster thermal time constants are usually on the order of 1 h, this long heating time was found to
be related to the facility thermal time constant. This behavior of the discharge loss with time and
temperature illustrates how characterization of the thruster must always be measured in thermal
equilibrium, because the performance of the discharge chamber is strongly affected by the neutral
gas density, which changes with the thruster temperature for a constant input flow rate.
5.3.11
Discharge Stability
There is a strong relationship between the discharge loss and the stability of the discharge. By
inspection of Eq. 5.3-65, it is clear that the efficiency increases (discharge loss decreases) if the
anode collection area for primary electrons Ap is minimized. Although it is logical to assume that
this is also true if the anode area for plasma electrons is minimized to reduce the energy loss from
the Maxwellian-electron population, a dependence on Aa does not appear in Eq. 5.3-65. However,
since the discharge current is carried to the anode primarily by the plasma electrons, the sheath
potential at the anode wall in Eq. 5.3-7 is found to decrease as the anode area decreases for a given
plasma electron current to the anode. This dependence on the sheath potential is seen in the dis-
charge loss equation, which suggests that minimizing the sheath potential maximizes the effi-
ciency. However, the anode area for plasma electrons cannot go to zero because the discharge
current could not be collected by the anode, and the discharge would either interrupt or become
unstable [22]. So there is some minimum anode area and plasma potential that can be tolerated for
discharge stability.
The value of the plasma potential relative to the anode (essentially the anode sheath voltage drop)
can be calculated using the expression for the random electron flux to the anode given in Eq. 5.3-7.
From current conservation in the discharge, an expression for the discharge current can also be
found from the current to the anode Eq. 5.3-53:

By inspection of Eq. 5.3-68, it is clear that as the anode area Aa decreases, the plasma potential also
decreases. If the anode area is made too small, then the plasma potential will go negative relative
to the anode potential. This is called a “positive going” or “electron accelerating” anode sheath,
and is illustrated in Fig. 5-22. In this case, the anode area at the cusps is insufficient to collect the
total discharge current by collection of the entire incident random electron flux over the anode
cusp area. The plasma then biases itself to pull in electrons in the Maxwellian distribution that are
not initially headed toward the anode, which delivers more current to satisfy the discharge current
and charge balance requirements. The plasma electron current collected by the anode then
becomes

where the potential ϕ is now a negative number. If the potential goes sufficiently negative relative to
the anode, the current density can reach a factor of two higher than the one-sided random electron
flux normally collected to satisfy the discharge current requirement.
However, once the potential goes sufficiently negative relative to the anode to repel the ions
(about Ti), then the anode area for the plasma electron is not the hybrid area, but is just twice
the plasma electron Larmor radius times the cusp length, similar to Eq. 5.3-3 for the primary loss
area. This results in a significant decrease in the cusp anode area Aa in Eq. 5.3-68 for negative
plasma potentials, which further lowers the plasma potential relative to the anode. Examining
the potential distribution in the plasma in Fig. 5-22, the transition from the normal negative-going
sheath to a negative plasma potential (positive-going anode sheath) will subtract from the primary
electron energy Vpe at a given discharge voltage. The ionization rate then decreases, and the dis-
charge collapses into a high impedance mode or oscillates between this mode and a positive poten-
tial typically on power supply time constants as the supply tries to reestablish the discharge by
increasing the anode voltage.
The stability of the plasma discharge at a given operating point (discharge current, beam current,
neutral density in the discharge chamber, etc.) is therefore determined by the magnetic field design.
For example, in Fig. 5-23, plasma potential is plotted as a function of the strength of the cusp mag-
netic field for an arbitrary thruster design with two different numbers of ring cusps. The cusp field
strength enters into the anode area Aa in Eq. 5.3-6, the primary electron loss area Ap in Eq. 5.3-3 and
in the plasma potential in Eq 5.3-68. The model predicts that a four-ring design would be unstable
(when the potential goes negative relative to the anode) for cusp magnetic fields greater than 2000
G. Since strong magnetic fields are desirable from a primary electron and ion confinement point of
188

view, additional rings are required to maintain a positive plasma potential. A six-ring design
increased the anode area sufficiently to raise the plasma potential at the 2000 G magnet design
point. An analysis of the discharge loss from Eq. 5.3-65 indicates that the improved stability asso-
ciated with the larger anode area of six-ring design comes with a loss in efficiency. The trade-off
between efficiency and stability is an important aspect of ion thruster design.

Recycling Behavior
Ion thrusters clear momentary faults or breakdowns in the high voltage accelerator grids by
momentarily turning off the high voltage, an event called recycling. To restart the thruster, the
accelerator grid (“accel grid”) voltage must be turned back on to avoid electron backstreaming into
the thruster as the screen voltage is reapplied. If the plasma discharge is left on during this

sequence, the negatively-biased accel grid collects nearly the entire ion beam current at the applied
accel voltage until the screen voltage is re-established. This can lead to excessive power loading and
even erosion of the accel grid if a significant number of recycles are encountered. Therefore, it is
standard procedure to also either turn-off the discharge during recycling, or cut it back to a low level
such that the accel grid current surge is acceptably low during reestablishing of the beam voltages.
The discharge current is then raised to the desired level with the screen voltage ramp-up.
The main issue with this process is that the thruster discharge often goes into oscillation during
the cutback condition or on restarting in the recycle sequence. When the high voltage is turned off
in a recycle, ions that would have left the discharge chamber as beam ions now strike and neutralize
on the accel grid, and some fraction flow back into the discharge chamber as neutral gas. This raises
the neutral gas pressure in the discharge chamber, which has two effects. First, a higher neutral
pressure collisionally thermalizes the primary electrons more rapidly, which can lead to a reduction
in the plasma potential [22]. Second, lowering the discharge current while raising the neutral pres-
sure leads to a lower impedance discharge and a lower discharge voltage. These two effects will be
shown next to cause a reduction the plasma potential, and thrusters designed for low discharge loss
with a minimum plasma potential at the nominal operating point can encounter negative plasma
potentials and discharge instability during recycling.
The time-dependent behavior of the pressure in the discharge chamber from the high-voltage-off
event can be calculated using molecular dynamics, and the subsequent time dependent plasma
potential for stability evaluated using the 0-D model. The time-dependent pressure [42] in the
thruster is given by
V dP
dt = Qin −CΔP,
5 3-70
where V is the discharge chamber volume, P is the pressure in the thruster discharge chamber, C is
the conductance of the grids and ΔP is the pressure drop across the grids. The initial pressure just
before the start of the recycle, when the thruster is operating normally, is found from Eq. 5.3-28 and
the conversion of neutral density to pressure in Eq. 2.7-2:
Po = 4 1 × 10 −25 ToQin 1 −ηm
υoe AgTaηc
5 3-71
With the high voltage off, the ions and neutrals flow to the grid region, where a small fraction exits
through the accel aperture to escape, and the majority strike the upstream side of the grids or the
grid aperture barrel wall and flow back into the thruster. Since the grid conductance is defined as
the flow divided by the pressure drop [42], the final pressure after steady state has been achieved is
Pf = 1 −Ta

5 3-72
where C is the conductance of the grids and the downstream pressure from the grids has been
neglected as small. The conductance of the grids can be estimated from the molecular conductance

is then

where Ma is the ion mass in AMU, and the effective open area of the grids is the optical transparency
of the accel grid, Ta, times the grid area Ag. Integrating Eq. 5.3-72 from the initial pressure to the
final pressure gives
P t = Pf −Pf −Po e −t τg,
5 3-74
where τg = V/C is the gas flow time constant for filling the thruster chamber. To use Eq. 5.3-74 to
find the final pressure, the gas flow rate has to be converted from particles per second to Torr-l/sec
by multiplying the neutral gas flow in Eq. 5.3-72 by 2.81 × 10−20.
Figure 5-24 shows an example of the pressure increase with time calculated in the NEXIS thruster
discharge chamber from the start of a recycle. The pressure in the discharge chamber during normal
operation is in the mid-10−5 Torr range due to the large grid area and high mass utilization effi-
ciency. During a recycle, the pressure in the discharge chamber reaches equilibrium in about
60 msec, with the pressure increasing almost an order of magnitude once the high voltage is turned
off. This magnitude of pressure increases in the thruster once the high voltage is turned off is con-
sistent with the ≈90% mass utilization efficiency of many thruster designs.
The plasma potential response to pressure changes in the discharge chamber calculated using the
0-D model for two different discharge voltages is shown in Fig. 5-25a for a given magnetic field
design. During the recycle, the discharge current is reduced (called cutback), which reduces the
discharge voltage and thereby the plasma potential. The model indicates that the plasma potential
reduction and subsequent unstable operation is the result of the lower discharge voltage, and does
not occur directly because of the discharge current being lower. This analysis shows that a given
thruster design that produces a stable discharge under normal conditions can go unstable due to
negative plasma potentials as the pressure rises and the discharge voltage decreases.
The plasma potential calculated using Eq. 5.3-68 for two magnet designs is shown in Fig. 5-25b for
the 23-V NEXIS case, which illustrates the effect of the smaller anode area reducing the plasma
potential at a given pressure. In this case, increasing the anode area permitted the discharge current

to be cutback during the recycle to the desired level without oscillating, which facilitates re-starting
the high voltage. Of course, the larger anode area increased the loss in the discharge chamber and
raised the discharge loss. This tradeoff is often required to provide good performance and stable
discharge operation.
5.3.13
Limitations of a 0-D Model
Although the 0-D models described in this chapter provide useful information on the design para-
meters of ion thrusters and give good insight into the plasma production and loss mechanisms,
there are several limitations to their use. First, 0-D models assume that the electron and neutral
densities are uniform and averages the ion production throughout the volume of the discharge
chamber. For ion thrusters with significantly non-uniform plasmas, this leads to inaccuracies in
the average plasma density and beam current calculated by the 0-D model that can only be handled
by multi-dimensional discharge chamber models. Second, the source of the gas in actual discharge
chambers is from the localized hollow cathode aperture and the gas manifold inside the discharge

chamber. The neutral density, therefore, is never completely uniform, and variations in the neutral
density can affect the transport, diffusion and ionization rates in the discharge chamber.
Third, ion thrusters with localized electron sources like hollow cathodes have strongly varying
primary electron densities within the discharge chamber. As shown earlier, the primary electron
density strongly affects the ionization rate, and so localized sources of primaries produce non-
uniform plasmas that the 0D models cannot address. In addition, these models utilize a monoener-
getic primary energy. A distribution in the primary electron energy has been measured in some ion
thrusters [43, 44], which changes the ionization and primary electron thermalization rates com-
pared to the monoenergetic calculations presented here. Although primary electron energy distri-
butions can be incorporated in 0-D models, this has not been attempted to date.
Finally, the 0-D model assumes monoenergetic primary electrons with an energy of
e(Vd −Vc + ϕ). For typical discharge voltages around 25 V and cathode voltage drops of 5–10 V,
this means that potentially none of the primaries have sufficient energy to doubly ionize xenon
which has an ionization potential of 21.2 V. Double ions can then only be produced by the tail
of the plasma electron distribution. For electron temperatures of 3–5 eV, less than 1% of the elec-
trons have sufficient energy to produce double ions. Since the double ion content in NSTAR thrus-
ters has been reported to exceed 20%, a monoenergetic primary electron energy causes the 0-D
model to not accurately address double ion production. Although including primary electrons
is necessary to obtain agreement between the 0-D models and experimental results, knowledge
of the correct energy distribution and even spatial variation in the primaries is required, and is
better handled by 2-D models discussed in Section 5.7.
5.4
Kaufman Ion Thrusters
The formulation of particle and energy balance models just described applies to any ion thruster
geometry where the electron loss can be defined by a finite anode electrode area collecting electrons
at a fraction of the random electron flux depending on the sheath voltage. One class of thrusters still
in use, the Kaufman ion thruster shown schematically in Fig. 5-26, features a strongly diverging
axial magnetic field that shields a cylindrical anode electrode located near the wall of the discharge
chamber. In this case, electron transport to the anode is determined by cross-field diffusion.
The flux of electrons due to cross-field diffusion is given by Eq. 3.6-71:
Γe = nv⊥= ± μ⊥nE −D⊥∇n
5 4-1
For the case of Kaufman thrusters, the perpendicular diffusion coefficient is likely to be close to the
Bohm diffusion coefficient [45]:
DB = 1
16
kTe
eB
5 4-2
The electron current collected by the anode is the flux that diffuses through the magnetic field times
the Boltzmann factor at the sheath:
Ia = μ⊥nE −D⊥∇n eAase −eϕ kTe ,
5 4-3
where Aas is again the anode surface area exposed to the plasma discharge. The actual current dis-
tributions and potential distribution in a Kaufman are the same as for DC discharge thruster shown
in Fig. 5-9. However, there are several terms that were analyzed for ring cusp thrusters that can be
neglected in Kaufman thrusters.
5.4 Kaufman Ion Thrusters
193

First, if the axial magnetic field is in the discharge chamber on the order of 100 G, then, the Lar-
mor radius for, say, 20 eV primaries is 1.5 mm. Since the magnetic field lines do not intersect the
anode and primaries are too energetic to participate in the collective instabilities that drive Bohm
diffusion, the primary electrons must make collisions to cross the magnetic field to be lost. That
means that the fraction of the primary electron current lost directly to the anode in ring-cusp thrus-
ters, IL, can be neglected, which is an advantageous feature for modeling of Kaufman thrusters.
Second, the plasma flow across the magnetic field is still governed by ambipolar effects. As was
shown in Section 5.3.4, if the transverse magnetic field strength is in excess of about 50 G in typical
ion thruster discharge chambers, then the radial electric field in the plasma (in the magnetic field
region) is near zero and the ion loss rate is on the order of one-tenth the Bohm current toward the
wall. This means that the ion current to the anode term, Iia, can also be neglected to first order. Since
the discharge current collected through the anode leg of the discharge power supply connection was
given in Eq. 5.3-66 as the plasma electron current minus the ion current plus the primary current,
the discharge current is now just
Id = Ia = −D⊥∇neAase −eϕ kTe
5 4-4
Third, the ion current flowing back towards the hollow cathode was neglected in our treatment of
ring-cusp thrusters because the hollow cathode exit area in contact with the plasma was so small. In
Kaufman thrusters, a baffle is placed on axis in front of the cathode to force the primary electrons off
axis to flatten the density profile. Since the magnetic field is strongly divergent, the axial plasma
density gradient is significant and the plasma density in contact with the baffle can be high. For
these reasons, the ion current to the cathode, Ik, can no longer be neglected.
The power into the plasma is given by Eq. 5.3-51. The power out of the discharge is given by

where εi is the ion energy leaving the plasma, which from Eq. 5.2-10 is equal to ϕ, and εe is the
electron energy removed from the plasma, which from Eq. 5.2-9 is 2TeV + ϕ. Equating the power

which is the same as Eq. 5.3-59 for DC ion thruster with the ion current to the cathode included and

Eq. 5.3-60, and the second current ratio I∗/Ib is given by Eq. 5.3-61. The current ratio Is/Ib is given

and the electron temperature is found from the similar iterative solution to the ion particle balance
in Eq. 5.3-39 used for ring-cusp thrusters. The negative sign in Eq. 5.4-9 appears problematic in the
natural log function, but the density gradient ∇n is negative going outward from the plasma. The
primary electron density is calculated from Eq. 5.3-50, with the ballistic loss term neglected as
described above since primaries are not lost directly to the anode. Finally, the plasma volume term
in the ion and excited neutral production rates can be assumed to be the volume of a cone from the
baffle to the grids because the plasma is well confined by the strong diverging magnetic field. Since
the 0-D model assumes relatively uniform plasma, estimates for the radial gradient of the plasma
density in the magnetic field region near the anode and the additional cathode voltage drop due to
the baffle must be made for Eq. 5.4-8 to be accurate.
As an example, take a conceptual Kaufman thruster with a 20 cm diameter screen grid with 80%
transparency, a 25 cm diameter anode with 25 cm between the grids and the baffle. Assuming that the
average magnetic field strength in the thruster is about 50 G, the discharge loss from Eq. 5.4-8 is plot-
ted in Fig. 5-27 for two values of the cathode voltage drop. In this case, the cathode voltage drop is
higher than in a ring cusp thruster because it includes the potential drop in the baffle region. The
discharge loss is strongly dependent on this value because it directly affects the primary electron
energy. Discharge losses in this range at mass utilization efficiencies of about 90% have been reported
in the literature for Kaufman thrusters through the years [46–48], suggesting that the 0-D model can
produce reasonable predictions of the discharge loss if the cross-field diffusion is handled properly.
The need for higher discharge voltages in Kaufman thrusters, compared to ring-cusp thrusters, is
illustrated in Fig. 5-28, where the discharge loss is plotted for the Kaufman thruster example above
5.4 Kaufman Ion Thrusters

with two cases of the discharge voltage at a constant (total) cathode voltage drop of 16 V. Low dis-
charge loss is achieved for the 35 V discharge voltage case, but decreasing the discharge voltage to
30 V causes the discharge loss to increase dramatically. This is because the primary electron energy
in the discharge chamber is near the threshold energy for ionization at this discharge voltage, and
the discharge efficiency decreases as more ionization is required from the plasma electrons. In addi-
tion, the lower discharge voltage causes the plasma potential to go significantly negative relative to
the anode potential (≈Te), which will cause the discharge to become unstable.
Although Kaufman-type thrusters are considered to be the first ion thruster to achieve good
discharge production performance, they now compete with ring-cusp thrusters for application
in modern electric propulsion systems. This is because of several constraints in Kaufman thruster

design. First, the strong axial magnetic field restricts electron motion to the anode to cross-field
diffusion, which requires either high neutral pressures in the discharge chamber for electron-
neutral collisional diffusion and, thereby, low mass utilization efficiency, or relies on collective
instabilities to increase the diffusion rate to obtain sufficient electron loss to support the dis-
charge. The instabilities are usually related to E × B driven instabilities and Bohm diffusion
[24], which create significant noise in the discharge that can appear in the beam current. Second,
the baffle required to force the primary electrons off axis to produce a more uniform plasma pro-
file is susceptible to ion bombardment sputtering and plasma losses in the dense plasma region
near the cathode. This has historically limited the life of these types of thrusters, although alter-
native materials can mitigate this problem. In addition, the primary electrons are injected purely
off axis, which means that the plasma profile, and hence the beam profile, can be hollow or
peaked depending on the cross-field diffusion and mobility throughout the discharge chamber.
Finally, the thruster size, shape and magnetic field strength is limited to regimes where the mag-
netic field is sufficient to confine ions by electrostatic ambipolar effects to obtain good efficiency,
and yet the magnetic field is not so high that the cross-field diffusion cannot provide adequate elec-
tron current for the discharge to be stable. If the field is too strong or the anode area in contact with
the plasma is too small, the plasma potential goes negative relative to the anode to pull the electrons
out of the discharge. It is shown in Fig. 5-22 that when the plasma potential is negative relative to
the anode, then the primary energy is decreased at a given discharge voltage, which strongly affects
the discharge efficiency [22]. Since the discharge voltage cannot be arbitrarily increased due to ion
sputtering of the baffle and screen electrodes, in addition to excessive double ion production, this
will significantly reduce the discharge efficiency. In the case of negative plasma potentials, the elec-
tron loss to the anode has the form [22]
Ia = −D⊥∇neAaseeϕ kTe 1 −erf −eϕ
kTe
1 2
−1

where ϕ is a negative number. The negative plasma potential increases the current to the anode
area Aas by pulling some of the electrons from the plasma population that were headed away from
the anode. Although up to a factor of two more electron current can be theoretically drawn com-
pared to the case of positive plasma potentials, in practice drawing even the random electron flux
can strongly deplete or perturb the Maxwellian population and affect the plasma discharge and
ionization rates. The geometry of Kaufman thrusters for good efficiency is limited to configurations
where the plasma potential in the discharge chamber is not allowed to go negative relative to the
anode, which constrains the design space for the electrodes and fields.
5.5
rf Ion Thrusters
The ion thrusters described in the previous sections utilize a thermionic hollow cathode and DC
discharge power supply to inject hot electrons into the discharge chamber to ionize the propellant
gas. To eliminate any potential life or power supply issues with the hollow cathode and DC-electron
discharge, an alternative thruster design utilizes electromagnetic fields to heat the plasma electrons
that, in turn, ionize the injected gas. One method to achieve this goal is to use an inductive plasma
generator, which is normally called a radio-frequency or rf ion thruster. In this case, low frequency
rf voltage is applied to an antenna structure around or in the plasma, and the rf energy is coupled to
the electrons that perform the ionization.
5.5 rf Ion Thrusters
197

The simplest configuration for an rf ion thruster is shown schematically in Fig. 5-29. The rf coil is
wrapped around an insulating chamber with a gas feed. The chamber can be cylindrical, hemi-
spherical or conical in shape and is connected to an ion accelerator structure that is the same as
those used for DC electron-bombardment ion thrusters with either two or three grids. The plasma
floats relative to the first grid, and the high voltage is applied between the two grids to accelerate
ions that flow through the first grid and form the beam. The rf coil is connected to a rf power supply
that provides the power to generate the plasma. There is usually no applied magnetic field in rf ion
thrusters, although one can be applied in principle to improve the discharge performance. As in
other ion thruster designs, the entire discharge chamber is enclosed in a metallic screen or structure
to eliminate electron collection from the space plasma, and a neutralizer cathode is connected to
provide net charge neutralization of the beam.
The coil wrapped around the insulating thruster body can be modeled as a solenoid with N turns,
and the rf voltage applied to it drives rf current in the coil. Typical frequencies used in rf ion thrusters
are inthe range of1 MHz.Atthese frequencies,the penetrationofthe fields fromthe coilatthe bound-
ary is limited by the skin depth in the plasma [24], which is on the order of, or slightly less than, the
radius of most rf ion thrusters at the plasma densities required to produce xenon ion current densities
in excess of 1 mA/cm2. This produces an attenuation of the electric and magnetic fields toward the
axis, and the majority of plasma interaction with the fields occurs off axis closer to the boundary.
The axial magnetic field inside the coil induced by the rf current, neglecting end effects, is
Bz = N I
μo

where I is the rf current in the coil, μo is the permeability of vacuum, ω is the cyclic frequency (2πf)

varying electric field:

The induced electric field exists in one direction (±θ direction) for roughly half a period, which
for a 1 MHz frequency is 0.5 μsec. The electrons, however, don’t see the oscillating component of the
electric field because they transit the interaction region close to the antenna in a time much less
than this value. For example, a 5 eV electron will travel a distance of about 1 m in 1 μs, and so can
traverse the electric field region many times within a half cycle. Therefore, electrons traversing the
induced electric field region “see” a DC electric field and are accelerated. If they make a collision
before leaving the region, they can then retain some or all of the velocity imparted by the electric
field and are heated.
The criteria for the rf plasma generator to provide net heating of the electrons is that a sufficient
number of electrons make a collision within the electric field interaction region. If the interaction
region is, say, a few centimeters across, the mean free path should be on this order. The probability
of an electron making a collision is given by
P = 1 −e −x λ = 1 −e −noσx
5 5-4
Using Eq. 2.7-2 to convert from neutral density to pressure (in Torr), the minimum pressure at a
temperature T in the plasma chamber of an rf thruster for breakdown to occur is
Pmin Torr = −1 04 × 10 −25 T
σ x
ln 1 −P
5 5-5
For example, the minimum pressure for starting the rf-generated plasma is plotted in Fig. 5-30,
where room temperature (290 K) xenon gas with a xenon atomic radius of 1.24 Å in a 5-cm long
interaction region is assumed. If 10% of the electrons must make an electron-neutral collision
within a 5 cm interaction region to provide sufficient heating for sustaining ionization and break-
down to proceed, then the minimum pressure in the thruster is about 1 × 10−3 Torr. Minimum pres-
sures in the range of 10−3 to 10−2 Torr are commonly reported in the literature for rf plasma sources
to ignite the plasma. Once the plasma source is ignited, the required electron collisions to provide
the heating in the rf electric fields can be supplemented by Coulomb collisions between the plasma
electrons, which reduces the operating pressure requirement and permits high mass utilization effi-
ciency to be achieved.

Starting an inductive plasma discharge can also be problematic because initially there are few free
electrons present to interact with the rf fields and ionize the fill gas. Before the plasma ignition, there
is no load on the rf circuit driving the coil; the reactive power stored in the inductive components in
the rf matching network grows, which increase the voltage across the coil and the induce higher
electric fields inside. If the minimum gas pressure is provided, the discharge will ignite when either
the field is large enough to excite the few electrons naturally present in the chamber, or cause field
emission to occur. Another method for ignition is to inject electrons from a spark generator, small
cathode, or most commonly the neutralizer cathode (with the accel voltage turned off momentarily)
into the discharge chamber to provide the seed electrons for interaction with the rf electric fields.
If the antenna in rf thrusters is directly exposed to the plasma, ions in the discharge can be accel-
erated by the rf voltage on the surfaces and sputter-erode the antenna. This can ultimately limit the
life of rf thrusters. This problem is minimized by either encasing the antenna in an insulator [49], or
by making the thruster body an insulating material and mounting the antenna exterior to the
plasma volume [50]. In this case, the rf voltage across the coil is shielded from the plasma, and
the ions are not accelerated to high energy before striking the insulator. Mounting rf antennas out-
side insulating-material walls such as quartz or alumina is common practice in inductive plasma
generators used in the semiconductor processing industry. An example of this arrangement applied
to a RIT-XT thruster [50] is shown in Fig. 5-31. In this case, the body of the thruster is constructed of
a conical (or hemispherical) alumina insulator, and a high conductivity material (typically copper)
antenna is coiled around the insulator. As long as the alumina body is not significantly coated by
conductive layers and remains an insulator, the rf fields will couple through the wall and generate
plasma.
This type of ion thruster is readily analyzed by a particle and energy balance model [51] because it
does not have localized electron sources (hollow cathodes or primary electrons); the rf fields simply
heat the Maxwellian electron distribution that provides the ionization, and the plasma in the

discharge chamber is very uniform. In the energy balance equation, it is assumed that the power
absorbed by the plasma is simply given by the net forward rf power absorbed Pabs. Ions generated in
the plasma volume drift to the interior surfaces in the thruster, and only electrons in the tail of the
Maxwellian distribution have sufficient energy to overcome the potential difference between the
plasma and the wall to be lost. The power out of the plasma equals the power absorbed, which
is given by
Pabs = I + U + + I ++ U ++ + I∗U∗+ Is + Iw + Ib ϕ + Ia 2TeV + ϕ ,

where U++ is the second ionization potential, and the ion and electron energy loss terms are shown

5 Ion Thruster Plasma Generators

As an example, assume that the rf ion thruster has a 20 cm grid diameter, an 18 cm deep conical
ceramic discharge chamber, a grid transparency of 80%, and that it produces 2 A of beam current in
xenon. Figure 5-32 shows the calculated discharge loss as function of the mass utilization efficiency
from Eq. 5.5-20 assuming no applied or induced magnetic fields and, therefore, no plasma confine-
ment. A discharge loss of about 450 eV/ion is predicted at 90% mass utilization efficiency. This is a
very high discharge loss, and it can be seen in Fig. 5-32 that the majority of the energy loss is carried
out by the ions and electrons flowing to the floating-potential walls. This is because the Maxwellian
electron temperature required to produce the ions that flow to the entire interior surface area of the
discharge chamber at 90% mass utilization efficiency (from the solution of Eq. 5.5-10 is 5 eV, and the
plasma potential to achieve net ambipolar flow is, therefore, nearly 30 V. The high sheath potential
required to self-confine the electrons for particle balance and the large plasma loss area (Aw + As)
carry significant energy to the discharge chamber wall, causing a high discharge loss.
The discharge loss performance of rf ion thrusters typically reported in the literature [51] is much
lower than that found in our example. This is because even though these thrusters do not usually
have an applied DC magnetic field, the rf coil forms a solenoid around the dielectric discharge
chamber and the rf current flowing in the antenna coil induces an AC magnetic field in the interior
of the discharge chamber with a frequency at the rf oscillator frequency. In most typical rf thrusters,
this frequency is on the order of 1 MHz. The ion acoustic speed
kTe M at Te = 5 eV is 1.9 km/s,
and so in a 1 μsec cycle, the ions can only move less than 2 mm, which implies that the ions can be
considered stationary on the magnetic field cycle time. The electrons are certainly not stationary in
the period, but the ion space charge will hold the electrons in place during a cycle. Therefore, the
AC magnetic field from the rf coil can provide some confinement for the plasma and reduce the flux
to the discharge chamber walls. The magnetic field induced by the rf coil depends on the coil size
and amount of power [52]. For example, assume that the coil occupies 1 turn per centimeter (100
turns/m), and the coil impedance is 50 Ω. For an input power of 500 W, this would result in 10 A of

rf current flowing in the coil. For simplicity, let’s assume the rf coil forms a solenoid and the mag-
netic field inside a solenoid (neglecting end effects) is
B Gauss = 104μoNI,
5 5-21
where μ0 is the permeability of free space = 4π × 10−7 Henries/m, N is the number of turns per
meter and I is the coil current in Amperes. For this rf thruster example, a magnetic field of 12.6
G is produced. Although this sounds like a low field, it is an axial field induced in the majority
of the interior of the thruster depending on the plasma skin depth, which is large in these low-
density plasmas.
The reduction in the ion velocity flowing radially to the wall for the situation of a transverse
magnetic field and ambipolar flows was analyzed in Section 5.3.4. Figure 5-33 shows the reduction
in the radial Bohm current (fc) from evaluating Eq. 5.3-16 for the condition where the diffusion
length is now essentially the thruster radius. Fields on the order of 10 G throughout the thruster
volume can reduce the ion and electron loss to the discharge chamber wall by over a factor of
two. Although the rf magnetic field strength decreases with radius due to the finite length of
the antenna coil (solenoid end effects), the field strength near the axis is still sufficient to reduce
the ion loss rate [51].
The discharge loss calculated by the 0-D model for our 20 cm rf thruster example is shown in
Fig. 5-34 as a function of rf magnetic field induced in the plasma. The discharge loss is reduced
from the assumption of no confinement (B = 0) of 450 eV/ion at 90% mass utilization to a value
of 230 eV/ion if 10 G is induced in the chamber. This is a significant reduction in the calculated
loss and is the key to rf ion thruster discharge performance.
To produce the 2 A beam in our 20-cm thruster example at 230 eV/ion, a total input power to the
antenna of 460 W is required to be absorbed by the plasma. Since the rf power supplies are typically
90% efficient in this frequency range, the input power to the thruster PPU would be about 511 W.
This predicted performance is in good agreement with the data from this size rf thruster found in

the literature [51], suggesting that a 0-D particle and energy balance model can provide reasonably
accurate performance predictions.
One advantage of rf ion thrusters is that they have only Maxwellian electrons and ambipolar ion
and electron loss rates, which simplifies the discharge loss expressions and makes it easy to analyze
the few geometric parameters to optimize the discharge loss. As an example of the process, first,
specifying the required beam current and current density determines the grid diameter in any
ion thruster. Ion optics codes then determine the grid transparency. Once the grid design is set,
a Monte-Carlo gas code is used to evaluate the Clausing factor introduced in Eq. 5.3-26. Assuming
a conical or cylindrical discharge chamber shape of a given length immediately specifies the loss
areas and plasma volume. Then, specifying the mass utilization efficiency gives the neutral density,
and the electron temperature can be found from Eq. 5.5-18 with an initial confinement factor
assumption. These values are the input parameters to the discharge loss given by Eq. 5.5-20, which
provides the required input rf power to the antenna assuming that the antenna efficiency and cou-
pling (reflected power) are known. The approximate induced AC magnetic field can then be cal-
culated from Eq. 5.5-21 and the ion confinement factor fc found as in Section 5.3.4. A simple
iteration then gives the final discharge loss and rf power.
Improvements in rf ion thruster discharge chamber models have been published in recent years.
Authors have added coupled thermal models [53], heuristic plasma density profiles models [24, 54],
and antenna coupling and neutral heating models [55] to 0-D models of the discharge chamber to
improve the agreement with experimental data. The physics of radio-frequency discharges has also
been detailed in a book [56]. Including thermal issues and antenna coupling increase the systems
level predictions for this thruster type. Nevertheless, the 0-D model presented here provides good
results for the discharge chamber behavior compared with the experimental data, and helps to
explain the observed performance.
The scaling of rf ion thrusters to small sizes and lower power operation is problematic. As the
discharge chamber length decreases, the antenna axial extent also decreases, which reduces the
electric field interaction region and decreases the AC axial magnetic field strength due to end effects
in the solenoid coil. The ability to breakdown the neutral gas initially and then to couple the rf

energy efficiently to the electrons is compromised as the length decreases, which affects the dis-
charge loss scaling.
Finally, a disadvantage of rf ion thrusters is that the antenna must be insulated from the plasma,
and the insulator is then subject to ion bombardment and material deposition. Dielectric discharge
chambers are susceptible to mechanical problems in fabrication, environmental testing and launch,
and life issues from coating of the insulator surface with conducting layers. The structural issues
have been addressed on some flight units by the use of a ceramic discharge chamber with an exte-
rior mounted antenna structure to provide the rigidity required for launch survival. Although the
discharge loss in rf ion thrusters is typically higher than that found for well-designed electron bom-
bardment ion thrusters such that the total efficiency is lower, the simplified design of an rf thruster
makes it easier to analyze them and predict the performance than most other ion thruster config-
urations. The rf thruster design concept eliminates any potential discharge cathode life issues and
utilizes fewer power supplies to operate the discharge. These factors make rf ion thrusters very com-
petitive for future space flight applications.
5.6
Microwave Ion Thrusters
An alternative to producing the plasma in the thruster with electron discharges or rf induction heat-
ing of the electron population is to generate the plasma using electromagnetic fields at microwave
frequencies. This eliminates life issues associated with the discharge hollow cathode, and the lack of
applied DC voltages in the discharge chamber can potentially reduce the sputter erosion of electro-
des exposed to the plasma compared to DC electron discharges. However, electromagnetic waves
can only propagate and be absorbed in plasmas under certain conditions. For example, if the micro-
wave frequency is too high or the plasma density too low, the microwave radiation is reflected com-
pletely from the plasma (called “cutoff”). If the conditions are such that the microwaves do
propagate in the plasma, the microwave energy is coupled to the plasma by resonant heating of
the electrons in a magnetic field in the presence of collisions. The required magnetic field to achieve
this resonance is significant, and the pressure required to achieve sufficient collisions to start the dis-
charge can be relatively high. These effects impact the plasma generator design and performance.
The propagation of microwaves in a plasma can be understood by examining the dispersion rela-
tionship. The behavior of microwaves in the thruster plasma is described by Maxwell’s equations:
∇× E = −∂B
∂t
5 6-1
∇× B = μo J + εo

The electromagnetic behavior is analyzed by linearizing these two equations using

5 6-3
B = Bo + B1
5 6-4
J = jo + j1,
5 6-5
where Eo, Bo and jo are the equilibrium values of the electric and magnetic fields and currents, and
E1, B1 and j1 are the perturbed values in the electromagnetic fields and current. Linearizing Eqs. 5.6-
1 and 5.6.2, realizing that the equilibrium values have no curl or time dependence, and that εoμo = 1/

5 6-15
where ne is the plasma density and υe1 is the perturbed electron velocity. If the applied magnetic

ω2 = nee2
ϵom + c2k2 = ω2
p + c2k2,
5 6-18
where the definition of the electron plasma frequency ωp

This expression can be solved for the wavelength of the microwaves in the plasma
λ =
2πc
ω2
p −ω2 =

f 2
p −f 2 ,
5 6-19
where fp is the real plasma frequency and f is the microwave frequency. If the microwave frequency
exceeds the plasma electron frequency, the wavelength becomes infinitely long and the wave
becomes evanescent (it will not propagate into the plasma) and is reflected. This condition, called
cutoff, determines the maximum plasma density into which a microwave source can inject power to
produce the plasma. Table 5-1 shows the cutoff frequency for a range of plasma densities and the
ion current density from a xenon plasma at an electron temperature of 3 eV. As an example, if the
ion thruster design requires an ion current density to the grids of say 1.2 mA/cm2, then a frequency
in excess of 2.85 GHz must be used to produce the plasma or else some or all the microwave power
will be reflected.
The microwave energy is coupled to the plasma by electron cyclotron resonance heating, where
the microwave frequency corresponds to the cyclic frequency of the electrons in a magnetic field.
The resonant frequency is the electron cyclotron frequency, which was derived in Chapter 3:
ωc = q B
m
5 6-20
The cyclotron frequency is easily calculated using a convenient formula of fc = eB/2πm = 2.8 GHz/
kG. In the plasma, the microwave frequency is given in Table 5-2 for several magnetic field values. If
it is assumed that the microwave energy is deposited into the volume of plasma immersed in the
magnet field, the maximum plasma density (and corresponding ion current density to the grids) to
avoid cutoff is shown for each of the magnetic field values. To produce current densities in excess of
1 mA/cm2 of xenon to the accelerator grids from a 3 eV electron temperature plasma requires mag-
netic fields in excess of 1000 G, and values closer to 2000 G are required to avoid cutoff for slightly
higher ion current densities to the grids. This is a significant magnetic field to produce over the
discharge chamber volume.

5 Ion Thruster Plasma Generators

The use of microwave radiation enables direct heating of the plasma electrons, but for the wave to
add energy to the electrons, collisions must occur. Otherwise, the energy received by an electron
during acceleration on each half-cycle of their cyclotron motion is taken back by deceleration of the
electron in the field on the next half-cycle. Therefore, there is a minimum pressure at which suf-
ficient collisions occur to ignite the plasma and sustain the discharge. The probability of a collision
occurring is
P = 1 −e −noσx = 1 −e −x λen
,
5 6-21
where x is the path length of the electron in the neutral gas with a density of no, and λen is the elec-
tron-neutral collision mean-free-path. An electron entering the interaction region gyrates around
the magnetic field lines due to its perpendicular velocity and travels along the magnetic field line
due to its parallel velocity.
Although the electron cyclotron heating tends to spin-up the electron motion around the field
lines, collisions tend to scatter the motion along the direction of the field lines and thermalize
the electrons into a Maxwellian distribution, sometimes with a high-energy bump or tail driven
by the resonance. The collisionality requirements to achieve heating can be found from examining
the path length of an electron at a temperature Te spiraling along a field line. The distance that the
electron travels when gyrating around the field lines is given by the Larmor radius of Eq. 3.3-13:

where υ|| is the parallel electron velocity along the field line. The number N of gyrations that an
electron makes in the interaction region is the microwave frequency f multiplied by the time in
the resonant region. The path length of the perpendicular gyration of the electron is then

5 6-25
Using this value for the path length x of the electron in Eq. 5.6-21 gives the probability of a collision
with the neutral gas. Figure 5-35 shows this probability calculated for xenon gas at room temper-
ature for electrons with a temperature of 2 eV in two different interaction lengths. To achieve the
order of 10% of the electrons colliding with neutral gas atoms in a 5–10-cm-long resonance region
requires an internal pressure of at least 10−3 Torr. In reality the electrons must make multiple colli-
sions within the interaction region because the energy gain in a single gyration is small. However,
this pressure is similar to that found for rf thrusters to achieve sufficient collisions to start or sustain
a discharge, for essentially the same reasons. Again, once the plasma is started, Coulomb collisions
will aid in transferring the electron motion in the microwave fields into heating, which reduces the
pressure required to operate the plasma generator and permits higher mass utilization efficiencies
to be achieved.
As was shown in Tables 5-1 and 5-2, a high magnetic field (>1 kG) and a high microwave fre-
quency (>2.8 GHz) are required to produce sufficient plasma density to deliver reasonable current
densities (>1 mA/cm2 in xenon) to the grids in microwave thrusters. Owing to the difficulty in pro-
ducing these high magnetic fields throughout the discharge chamber volume, the resonance region
is often localized to a small zone inside the thruster volume and the plasma allowed to expand to the
grids along divergent magnetic field lines. Figure 5-36 shows an ECR plasma source where a
stronger magnetic field region resonant with 2.45 GHz radiation (produced by commercial magne-
tron microwave sources) is restricted to the rear of the discharge chamber. Of course, expanding the
plasma from the resonance region to the grids decreases the plasma density and current density, so
even higher magnetic fields and frequencies than just mentioned are normally required in the inter-
action region to produce over 1 mA/cm2 to the grids.

5 Ion Thruster Plasma Generators

The microwave radiation in this ECR plasma source is coupled into the rear of the discharge
chamber through a waveguide window, and a quartz liner is used in the resonant region to ensure
that the hot electrons are not lost directly to the metal walls of the chamber. The magnetic field in
this geometry is produced by electromagnets, with a strong divergence in the field to spread the
plasma over the grid region at the exit of the discharge chamber. This is a common geometry
for industrial ion sources and plasma sources used in plasma processing, and the performance
of the plasma generator is well known.
The performance of this style microwave ion thruster can be examined with a 0-D model. Assume
that the magnetic field is sufficiently strong enough that radial losses can be neglected. This
assumption implies that the plasma is frozen on the field lines such that the density decreases lin-
early with the area increase as the field expands. This simplifies the model to the case of a straight
cylindrical source with no radial losses. The plasma is lost axially to both the screen area As and the
rear wall area Aw. Since there is no DC applied electric field, the plasma floats relative to the internal
surfaces, the electrons are lost to the axial rear-wall area and the collection area of the screen grid
given by (1 −Ts)As. Neglecting the cost of producing the microwave radiation, the power absorbed
by the plasma is equal to the power lost:
Pabs = IpU + + I∗U∗+ Is + Iw + Ib ϕ + Ia 2TeV + ϕ ,
5 6-26
where Is is the ion current collected by the screen grid, Iw is the ion current collected by the entire
wall, and the ion energy loss is again just the plasma potential relative to the wall ϕ. The amount of
energy lost by electrons to the wall assumes that the electrons have a Maxwellian distribution,
which may underestimate the energy lost due to the high energy tail in the electron distribution
generated by the resonant ECR heating. The discharge loss is the power in (or out) divided by
the beam current:

with the plasma potential given by Eq. 5.6-30. The electron temperature and neutral density are
solved in the same manner as previously for the other types of thrusters. The discharge loss for
a generic microwave ion thruster producing 1 A of xenon ions from a 20 cm diameter grid with
80% transparency is shown in Fig. 5-37 for several thruster lengths. Discharge losses on the order
of 200 eV/ion are predicted. This discharge loss is comparable to that of our idealized ion thruster in
Section 5.2 for short thruster lengths, but nearly twice that found for comparable long ideal thrus-
ters. This is because both the ideal and the microwave source cases assumed ionization by Maxwel-
lian electrons and perfect radial confinement, but the microwave source case includes plasma loss
to the rear wall. Although the assumption of negligible radial loss is reasonable in microwave thrus-
ters due to the strong magnetic fields, some additional loss is expected in this direction that will
degrade the actual discharge loss somewhat. The large loss area for plasma to the beam area
and rear wall tend to drive up the plasma potential to maintain net ambipolar flows and charge
balance, which increases the discharge loss compared to well-designed DC discharge thrusters.
Microwave ion source designers mitigate the backwall losses by imposing a stronger magnetic
field upstream of the resonance zone. This creates a magnetic mirror, which was described in
Section 3.3, that confines the plasma electrons and reduces the axial losses. Because the magnetic
212
5 Ion Thruster Plasma Generators

moment (defined in Eq. 3.3-22 as mυ2
⊥2B) is invariant along the magnetic field lines, electrons with
sufficient initial perpendicular velocity are reflected from the increasing magnetic field as their par-
allel energy is converted into rotational energy. The electrons that are lost along the magnetic field
lines have a parallel velocity of
υ > υ⊥
Rm −1,
5 6-34
where Rm is the mirror ratio given by Bmax/Bm. For example, if the mirror ratio is 5, only electrons
with a parallel velocity twice that of their perpendicular velocity will be lost. If the electrons have
a Maxwellian distribution with a temperature Te, then the number of particles with υ|| > 2υ⊥is
e−2 = 13.5%, so a large majority of the population is reflected. Since the cyclotron heating adds per-
pendicular energy to the electrons, mirror ratios of four to six are very efficient in confining the
heated electrons that produce ionization.
The ion source shown in Fig. 5-36 utilizes electromagnets to produce the high field over a signif-
icant volume and also to create the confining mirror ratio. However, the power required to operate
the electromagnets in this design increases the effective discharge loss and limits the electrical effi-
ciency of the device in thruster applications. In addition, it is difficult to create large area plasmas
with good uniformity using microwave excitation due to the strong magnetic fields that confine the
plasma and influence the profile. This leads to other magnetic configurations to produce the plasma
using microwave ECR techniques.
In a volume-ionization ECR sources, like that shown in Fig. 5-36, a significant fraction of the
discharge chamber must be filled with a strong magnetic field to satisfy the resonance condition.
If this field is produced by a solenoid the electrical power is likely a significant penalty for the
thruster efficiency. Likewise, if the field is produced by permanent magnets, the weight of the mag-
netic material required to produce this field can represent a significant weight penalty for the
thruster. This problem can be mitigated by using magnetic multipole boundaries that produce

strong magnetic fields at the discharge chamber wall using ring or line-cusp magnet configurations.
Figure 5-38 shows the field lines between two magnet rings and the regions of strong magnetic field
close to the magnet where the resonant condition is satisfied. Injection of the microwave radiation
between the cusps, either by cutoff-waveguides inserted between the rows [57], by slotted wave-
guides run along the rows [58], or by antenna structures placed between the rows, will couple
the microwaves to the high magnetic field interaction region.
Although this geometry eliminates the solenoidal magnet coils and minimizes the size of the per-
manent magnets required to produce the resonant field strength, there are several issues remaining.
First, the magnetic field strength in the cusp region decreases as one over the distance from the
surface squared. This means that very strong magnets are required to produce the resonant field
at any significant distance from the wall. Second, electrons that gain energy from the microwaves
can be easily lost along the field lines to the wall due to their finite parallel velocity. This means that
optimal ECR designs using permanent multipole magnets will have the resonance region as far
from the wall as possible, and produce a large mirror ratio approaching the wall to reflect the elec-
trons to avoid excessive direct loss.
Nevertheless, wall losses are a concern in this configuration because the plasma production is a
surface effect that is confined to the boundary region, as is the loss. Electrons that are heated in the
resonance zone sufficiently to ionize the propellant gas generate plasma on the near-surface mag-
netic field lines. Coupling the plasma from the resonance region or the surface magnetic layer into
the volume of the thruster is problematic due to the reduced cross-field transport. In the other
thruster designs discussed in this chapter, the ion production was a volume effect and convective
loss a surface effect, so thruster efficiency scaled as the volume to surface ratio. This means that
larger DC and rf discharge thrusters can be made more efficient than smaller ones. Microwave
thrusters, on the other hand, don’t scale in the same manner with size because large amounts
of plasma must be produced and transported from the surface region to fill the volume of larger
thrusters, which can impact the discharge loss. In addition, the plasma density is limited by both
cutoff and the magnitude of the resonant field, and so high current density ion production requires
very high magnetic fields and high microwave frequencies. Therefore, microwave thrusters
have been limited to date to lower current densities and smaller sizes than the other thrusters dis-
cussed here. However, work continues on scaling microwave thrusters to larger sizes and higher
efficiencies.

5 Ion Thruster Plasma Generators

The most successful design of a microwave thruster to date is the μ10 ECR 10-cm microwave
thruster [58–60]. The μ10 ion thruster, shown schematically in Fig. 5-39 with the microwave power
and flow control systems, is an improved version [61–63] where the thrust and life were increased
over the original version that flew in space on the Hayabusa Mission. In this thruster, extremely
strong SmCo magnets are used to close the resonance field at the operating frequency between
the magnets. This produces heating away from the wall and traps the electrons on the field lines
due to a mirror ratio of two to three achievable in this geometry. The thruster volume is also mini-
mized, with the plasma production region close to the grids. This configuration produces over 1
mA/cm2 of xenon ions over the active grid region using a 4.2 GHz microwave source with a dis-
charge loss of about 300 eV per ion at over 85% mass utilization efficiency [58].
Finally, there are several other components intrinsic to these thrusters that contribute to the dif-
ficulty of achieving high efficiency and compact size in a microwave thruster subsystem. Sources of
microwave frequencies in the gigahertz range, such as traveling wave tubes (TWT) and magne-
trons, have efficiencies in the 50–70% range and the power supply to run them is usually about
90% efficient. This represents nearly a factor of two in-line loss of the electrical power delivered
to the thruster that must be account for in the total discharge cost of the sub-system. The plasma
is typically a difficult load to match well, and reflection of 10–30% of the microwave energy back
into the recirculator (which absorbs the reflected power from the thruster in the case of mismatch
or faults) is typical. The microwave source and recirculator usually represent a significant mass and
volume addition to the ion thruster system. To avoid cutoff and produce ion current densities to the
grids of 1–2 mA/cm2, from an examination of Table 5-1, requires microwave sources in the 4–6 GHz
range. At this time, space TWTs in this frequency range are limited in power capability to the order
of a few hundred watts. For a given discharge loss, this limits the total ion current that can be pro-
duced by a microwave thruster. Although microwave thrusters hold the promise of eliminating the
need for thermionic cathodes used in DC-discharge thrusters, and doing away with the requirement
for dielectric discharge chambers in rf thrusters, producing high efficiency, high thrust ion propul-
sion systems based on this technology can be challenging. This is certainly an area for continued
future research.

2-D Models of the Ion Thruster Discharge Chamber
The analytical models described above can generally explain the behavior and predict the overall
discharge chamber performance of well-defined configurations, but multi-dimensional computer
models are required to predict thruster performance parameters such as plasma profile and double
ion content, and to examine the details of different designs. Multi-dimensional modelling of the
discharge chamber requires detailed models of discharge chamber walls and magnetic fields as well
as neutral propellant gas, ions, and primary and secondary plasma electrons [64–68]. Because the
important physical mechanisms are different, each species (neutral gas, ions, and primary and sec-
ondary electrons) is modeled differently. For example, most neutral gas atoms travel in straight
lines until they hit a wall or are ionized, so the neutral models can take advantage of simple
straight-line trajectories to develop neutral density profiles. On the other hand, primary electron
trajectories are dominated by rotation around magnetic field lines, and typically particle-tracking
techniques are used to determine the density and spatial distributions. Ion and secondary electron
behavior is obtained using fluid equations due to the relatively collisional behavior of the species.
Therefore, ion thruster discharge models that require computer codes that use both fluid and par-
ticle tracking models are known as “Hybrid” codes.
Figure 5-40 shows a generic flow diagram for an ion thruster hybrid model [66]. Using the
thruster inputs (geometry), a mesh is generated inside the discharge chamber. A magnetic field
solver determines the field everywhere in the chamber. Depending on the type of mesh used,
the mesh-generator may be iterated with the magnetic field solver to align the mesh points with
the magnetic field lines. Aligning the magnetic field line simplifies the plasma diffusion

calculations since the equations can be separated into parallel and perpendicular components,
which can result in improved code accuracy for a sufficiently fine mesh. A neutral gas model, such
as the “view-factor” model described below, determines the neutral density throughout the volume.
The “ionization model” uses the magnetic field and electric field to compute the trajectories of pri-
mary electrons and their collisions with other plasma components (i.e. neutrals, ions, secondary
electrons), which create ions and serve to dissipate the primary electron energy. The ionization
model also determines the collisions due to secondary electrons. The ion optics model determines
the transparency of the ion optics to neutrals and ions, as described in detail in Chapter 6. The ion
diffusion model uses the magnetic field information and plasma properties to determine the motion
of the plasma. The electron thermal model determines the energy balance for the electrons to find
the distribution of temperatures of the secondary electron population. These processes are iterated
until a convergent solution is found.
5.7.1
Neutral Atom Model
Accurate knowledge of the neutral gas is required in multi-dimensional plasma codes to predict the
beam profiles, details of discharge plasma behavior, and thruster performance. For example, many
thrusters utilize localized sources and sinks of the neutral gas that produce non-uniform neutral
density profiles that must be considered to understand performance.
Ion thrusters operate at internal pressures on the order of 1 × 10−4 Torr or lower to achieve good
mass utilization efficiency. In this pressure range, the neutral gas can be considered to be collision-
less, and simple Knudsen-flow models are normally used to determine the average neutral gas den-
sity inside the thruster. Assuming surface adsorption, propellant atoms collide with the chamber
walls and are re-emitted with a cosine distribution at the wall temperature. Collisions with the wall
act to thermalize the gas to the wall temperature. Inside the discharge volume, the neutral atoms
collide with electrons and ions. Some neutral atoms are “heated” by charge exchange that transfers
the local ion energy to the neutral, but this process has little effect on the average gas temperature in
the thruster discharge chamber. The spatial distribution of the neutral density is dependent on the
gas injection regions (sources), gas reflux from the walls, loss of gas out the ion optic apertures, and
the internal “loss” of neutral particles by ionization.
Wirz and Katz [66] developed a technique that accurately predicts the neutral gas density profiles
in ion thrusters. Their model utilizes a 3-D generalization of the view factor formulation used in
thermal models [69]. The view factor approach assumes that neutral particles travel in straight lines
between surfaces, and, after hitting a surface, they are emitted isotopically. In this technique [70], a
3-D boundary mesh and a 2-D internal mesh in the thruster discharge chamber are created for an
axisymmetric discharge. The steady state neutral fluxes are determined by balancing the injection
sources, reemission from the walls, loss through the ion optics, and loss due to ionization. The local
neutral density at each of the internal mesh points is calculated by integrating its view factor from
the source points (all the other mesh points in the thruster), which includes the “loss” of neutrals
between the source and the mesh point due to ionization by the plasma. The ionization losses affect
the neutral gas analogous to absorption diminishing the intensity of a light ray. The neutral gas
code and the rest of the model components, discussed below, are iterated until a stable solution
for the neutral density at each mesh point is found. One advantage of this model is that the neutral
gas temperature can be tracked after the gas interacts with the wall temperatures specified at the
boundary mesh points. Also this technique is much faster than a Monte Carlo code since it requires
a single matrix solution, allowing the coupling of the neutral and plasma codes to quickly deter-
mine both neutral and plasma density profiles.

An example of the axisymmetric boundary (“wall”) and internal meshes for the NSTAR ion
thruster from Wirz and Katz [66] is shown in Fig. 5-41. Gas enters from the hollow cathode at

The neutral gas density calculated from this code for the NSTAR thruster in its high power TH15
mode is shown in Fig. 5-42. The neutral density is highest near the injection sources at the hollow
cathode and the propellant injection manifold. The neutral gas is the lowest on axis near the grids
due to the NSTAR feed arrangement; however, as discussed below, the high primary electron

density found in this region of the thruster produces significant ionization, and “burns-out” the
neutral gas. This result is critically important because the production of doubly-ionized atoms
increases dramatically in regions where the neutral gas is burned out and most of the electron
energy goes into secondary ionization of the ions in the discharge chamber.
5.7.2
Primary Electron Motion and Ionization Model
Particle simulation methods have been applied to model primary electron motion in ion thruster
discharge chambers [66–68, 71, 72]. In particle simulations, the primary electrons are represented
by particles, or macro-particles that represent a large number of primary electrons, that move in
discrete time steps based on their initial conditions, applied boundary conditions, and internal elec-
tric and magnetic fields. Monte Carlo techniques are used to introduce the particles from the cath-
ode exit into the computational domain at randomized velocities indicative of the cathode emission
characteristics. During each time step, the local fields are recalculated based on the new particle
position and velocity, and the particles move based on the local forces. Monte Carlo techniques
are also typically used to handle collisions between the particles. This procedure is repeated
through many time steps until the particle is lost; after which the next particle is introduced at
a unique initial velocity condition.
The primary electron motion between collisions is treated as the motion of a charged particle in
the presence of an electromagnetic field, which is described by the Lorentz equation
m ∂v
∂t = q E + v × B
5 7-1
Wirz and Katz [66] developed an improved Boris-type particle pushing algorithm [73] where the
motion of the particles can be described with an implicit particle-pushing algorithm where the Lor-
entz forces on the particle are decomposed into electric and magnetic forces. The primary’s kinetic
energy is assumed to be unchanged in an elastic collision, and the particle scattering angle is esti-
mated by a 3-D probabilistic hard sphere scattering model [66]. In an inelastic collision, some frac-
tion of the primary energy goes into excitation or ionization of the neutrals. Additional energy loss
paths exist, as previously discussed, such as Coulomb collision thermalization and anomalous pro-
cesses associated with instabilities. A typical primary trajectory in the NSTAR thruster from the
Wirz code is shown in Fig. 5-43, where the primaries are well confined by the strong axial magnetic
field component in this thruster, and collisional effects eventually scatter the primary in to the cusp
loss cone. Arakawa and Yamada’s model for primary electron motion is derived from the Euler–
Lagrange equations for the Lagrangian of a charge particle in a magnetic field [71]. However, this
technique is computationally more intensive and does not improve the results in comparison to the
improved Boris algorithm.
The primary electron density calculated by Wirz for the TH15 operating condition is shown in
Fig. 5-44 and reveals that the magnetic field configuration of NSTAR tends to trap the primary elec-
trons from the cathode on the thruster axis. This trapping of primary electrons, combined with the
low neutral density on-axis, causes a relatively high rate of production of double ions along the
thruster axis.
The ion and secondary electron transport may be treated by an ambipolar ion diffusion equation
derived from the single ion and electron continuity and momentum equations. The steady-state
continuity equation for ions is

where the species mobilities and diffusion coefficients are determined by separately equating the

where viscous effects are ignored and R is the mean change of momentum of electrons due to colli-

thermal conductivity to determine the total energy loss to the boundaries. Temperatures calculated
from the electron energy equation are shown in Fig. 5-45 for the NSTAR thruster. The strong on-
axis confinement of the primaries in NSTAR tends to locally heat the plasma electron population,
generating a high on-axis plasma temperature.

thruster at throttle condition TH15 are plotted in Fig. 5-46 where the beam current density profile
calculated by the model agrees well with experimental data obtained during the 8200 hour Long
Duration Test [75]. The peaked plasma profile is due to the strong confinement of the electrons
from the cathode by the NSTAR magnetic configuration, which depletes the neutral gas on axis
and produces a significant number of double ions. The “Modified B fields” profile in Fig. 5-46 is
an example of the model prediction for the case of a modified magnetic field geometry that makes
it easier for primary electrons to move away from the thruster axis. The ion density calculated by the
Wirz-Katz model for the NSTAR magnetic is shown in Fig. 5-47. As suggested by the primary den-
sity and plasma electron temperatures in Figs. 5-44 and 5-45, the plasma density is strongly peaked

on axis. Finally, the double-to-total ion ratio distribution throughout the discharge chamber is
shown in Fig. 5-48. These results agree with experimental data that suggests the on-axis peak in
the NSTAR beam profile is due to high centerline double ion content.
Analysis by the Wirz-Katz model results shows that the original NSTAR magnetic field config-
uration tends to trap primary electrons on-axis, which increases local electron temperature, ioni-
zation rate, and the generation of double ions in this region. This trapping of primary electrons also
manifests in a neutral atom depletion on-axis, as was shown in Fig. 5-46. The “modified” config-
uration in this figure shows the power of a good computer model to improve ion thruster design. By
allowing the primary electrons to move away from the thruster axis, the ionization is spread more
uniformly throughout the discharge chamber. The flatter profile results from a decrease in primary
electron density, and hence double ion content, on the thruster centerline. Wirz and Goebel [26]
developed “modified” NSTAR designs that guide primary electrons away from the thruster center-
line to improve the profile. These designs were validated by experiments [76], and also resulted in
lower double ion content and higher neutral density along the thruster axis as predicted by
the model.

In Fig. 5-16 it is shown that the reaction rate for ionization exceeds the reaction rate for exci-

5 Ion Thruster Plasma Generators

Chapter 6
Ion Thruster Accelerators
Ion thrusters are characterized by the electrostatic acceleration of ions extracted from the plasma
generator [1]. An illustration of a DC electron bombardment ion thruster showing the ion accel-
erator, the plasma generator, and the neutralizer cathode was shown in Fig. 1-1. The ion accelerator
in “gridded ion thrusters” consists of electrically biased multi-aperture grids, and this assembly is
often called the ion optics. The design of the grids is critical to the ion thruster operation and is a
trade between performance, life, and size. Since ion thrusters need to operate for years in most
applications, life is often the major design driver. However, performance and size are always impor-
tant to satisfy the mission requirements for thrust and Isp and to provide a thruster size and shape
that fits onto the spacecraft.
There are many factors that determine the grid design in ion thrusters. The grids must extract the
ions from the discharge plasma through the “screen” grid and focus them through the downstream
acceleration (“accel”) grid and the deceleration (“decel”) grid (if one is used). This focusing has to
be accomplished over the range of ion densities produced by the discharge chamber plasma profile
that is in contact with the screen grid, and also over the throttle range of different power levels that
the thruster must provide for the mission. Since the screen grid transparency was shown in
Chapter 5 to directly impact the discharge loss, the grids must minimize ion impingement on
the screen grid and extract the maximum number of the ions that are delivered by the plasma dis-
charge to the screen grid surface. In addition, the grids must minimize neutral atom loss out of the
discharge chamber to maximize the mass utilization efficiency of the thruster. High ion transpar-
ency and low neutral transparency drives the grid design toward larger screen grid holes and smal-
ler accel grid holes, which impacts the optical focusing of the ions and the beam divergence. The
beam divergence should also be minimized to reduce thrust loss and plume impact on the space-
craft or solar arrays, although some amount of beam divergence can usually be accommodated.
Finally, grid life is of critical importance and often drives thruster designers to compromises in
performance or alternative grid materials. In this chapter, the factors that determine grid design
and the principles of the ion accelerators used in ion thrusters will be described.
6.1
Grid Configurations
To accelerate ions, a potential difference must be established between the plasma produced inside
the thruster plasma generator and the ambient space plasma. As shown in Chapter 3, simply bias-
ing the anode of a DC plasma generator or the electrodes of a rf plasma generator relative to a space-

the voltage will just appear in the sheath at the plasma boundary with the walls. If the potential is
small compared to the electron temperature Te, then a Debye sheath is established, and if the poten-
tial is very large compared to Te, then a Child-Langmuir sheath exists. Therefore, to accelerate ions
to high energy, it is necessary to reduce the dimension of an aperture at the plasma boundary to the
order of the Child-Langmuir distance to establish a sheath that will accelerate the ions with rea-
sonable directionality (good focusing) and reflect the electrons from the plasma. Figure 6-1 shows
the Child-Langmuir length calculated from Eq. 3.7-35 for two singly charged ion current densities
at an acceleration voltage of 1500 V. For xenon, the characteristic aperture dimension at this voltage
is on the order of 2–5 mm and will decrease if the applied voltage is reduced or the current in the
aperture is increased.
The ion current obtainable from each grid aperture is then limited by space charge. For a 0.25 cm
diameter aperture extracting the space charge limited xenon current density of about 5 mA/cm2
at 1500 V (according to the Child-Langmuir Eq. 3.7-35), the total ion current per aperture is only
0.25 mA. Assuming this produces a well-focused beamlet, the thrust produced by this current and
voltage from Eq. 2.3-9 is only about 16 micro-Newtons. Therefore, multiple apertures must be used
to obtain higher beam currents from the ion engine to increase the thrust. For example, to extract a
total of 1 A of xenon ion current for this case would require over 4,000 apertures, which would
produce over 60 mN of thrust. In reality, for reliable high voltage operation and due to non-
uniformities in the plasma generator producing varying ion current densities to the boundary,
the current density is usually chosen to be less than the Child-Langmuir space charge maximum
and an even larger number of apertures are required. This ultimately determines the size of the ion
thruster.
Figure 6-2 shows a simplified 1-D view of one of these biased apertures facing the thruster plasma.
The Child-Langmuir sheath is established by the bias potential between the thruster plasma and the
accelerator grid (called the “accel grid”) and is affected by the current density of the xenon ions
arriving at the sheath edge from the Bohm current. Ions that arrive on axis with the aperture
are accelerated through to form the beam. However, ions that miss the aperture are accelerated
into the accel grid and can erode it rapidly. For this reason, a “screen” grid with apertures aligned
with the accel grid is placed upstream of the accel grid to block these ions. This is the classic two-
grid accelerator system [1, 2]. The screen grid is normally allowed to either float electrically or is

biased to the cathode potential of the plasma generator to provide some confinement of the electrons
in the plasma, and so ions that strike it have a relatively low energy that can still cause some ion
sputtering. In practice, the grids are made of refractory metals or carbon-based materials, and the
apertures are close-packed in a hexagonal structure to produce a high transparency to the ions from
the plasma generator. These grids are also normally dished to provide structural rigidity to survive
launch loads and to ensure that they expand uniformly together during thermal loading [1, 3].
The electrical configuration of an ion thruster accelerator is shown schematically in Fig. 6-3. The
high voltage bias supply (called the screen supply) is normally connected between the anode and

the common of the system, which is usually connected to the neutralizer cathode (called
“neutralizer common”) that provides electrons to neutralize the beam. Positive ions born in
the discharge chamber at high positive voltage are then accelerated out of the thruster. The accel
grid is biased negative relative to the neutralizer common to prevent the very mobile electrons in
the beam plasma from back-streaming into the thruster, which would produce localized heating
in the discharge chamber by energetic electron bombardment, and would ultimately overloads
the screen supply if the backstreaming current becomes large. The ion beam is current neutra-
lized and quasi-neutral (nearly equal ion and electron densities) by the electrons extracted from
the neutralizer cathode. Fortunately, the thruster self-biases the neutralizer common potential
sufficiently negative relative to the beam potential to produce the required number of electrons
to current neutralize the beam.
Figure 6-3 has a generic thruster that includes a three-grid accelerator system where a final grid
called the “decel grid” is placed downstream of the accel grid. This grid shields the accel grid from
ion bombardment by charge-exchanged ions produced in the beam back flowing toward the
thruster, and eliminates the downstream “pits and groves erosion” that will be discussed in
Section 6.6. Three grid systems then potentially have longer accel grid life than two grid systems
and generate less sputtered material into the plume that can deposit on the spacecraft. These
benefits are offset by the increased complexity of including the third grid.
In actual design, the diameter of each accel grid aperture is minimized to retain unionized neutral
gas in the plasma generator, and the screen grid transparency is maximized so that the grids extract
the maximum number of ions from the plasma as possible. The electrode diameters and spacing are
then optimized to eliminate direct interception of the beam ions on the accel grid, which would
cause rapid erosion due to the high ion energy. A schematic example of a three-grid system showing
the ion trajectories calculated by a 2D ion–optics code [4] is given in Fig. 6-4, where the figure shows
half the beamlet mirrored on the axis. The ions are focused sufficiently by this electrode design to
pass through the accel grid without direct interception. On the downstream side of the accel grid,
the negative accel-grid bias applied to avoid electron backstreaming results in a relatively small
deceleration of the ions before they enter the quasi-neutral beam potential region. This high trans-
parency, strong “accel-decel” geometry typical of ion thrusters results in some beamlet divergence,
as suggested by the figure. However, this small beamlet angular divergence of typically a few
degrees causes negligible thrust loss because the loss scales as cos θ, and because most of the beam

divergence discussed in Chapter 2 related to the thrust correction factor is due to the dishing of
the grids.
The amount of current that an ion accelerator can extract and focus into a beam for a given
applied voltage is related to the space charge effects characterized by the Child-Langmuir equation,
and is called the perveance:

(6.1-1)
The maximum perveance that can be achieved by an accelerator is given by the coefficient in the
Child-Langmuir equation:

(6.1-2)
For an electron accelerator, this coefficient is the familiar value of 2.33 × 10−6 A/V3/2, and for singly

(6.1-4)
Therefore, to maximize the perveance of the accelerator, it is desirable to make the grid gap smaller
than the aperture diameters, as illustrated in the example configuration shown in Fig. 6-4.
The ion trajectories plotted in Fig. 6-4 that do not intercept either of the grids, and the minimal
beamlet divergence, result from operating at or near the optimal ion current density and voltage for
the grid geometry shown. Operating at significantly less than the optimal perveance, called “under-
perveance” and corresponding to higher voltages or lower beamlet currents than the optimal com-
bination, increases the CL length and pushes the sheath to the left farther into the plasma. In the
extreme case, this situation can launch ions at a very large angle from the edge region near the
screen aperture and cause “cross-over” trajectories, which can then produce excessive erosion of
the accel grid by direct ion impingement. Likewise, operating at higher than the optimal perveance,
corresponding to higher beamlet currents or lower voltages than optimal, reduces the Child-
Langmuir sheath thickness and the plasma boundary pushes toward the screen aperture. This
“over-perveance” condition flattens the sheath edge and accelerates ions directly into the accel grid,
again causing excessive erosion. The optical performance and life of any grid design, therefore, is
acceptable only over a limited range in voltage and current density, which will be discussed in
Section 6.3. For this reason, the uniformity of the plasma over the grid area is important to avoid
either cross-over or direct interception in different regions of the ion optics that strongly degrade the
life of the grids.
In the two or three grid configurations, the geometry of the grid apertures and gaps is intended to
eliminate or at least minimize direct impingement by beam ions on the most negative potential
electrode in the system; namely, the accel grid. This is required to minimize sputtering of the grid
by the high-energy beam ions. The screen grid does receive ion bombardment from the discharge

plasma because of its finite transparency, but the ions arrive with only energy of the order of the
discharge voltage in DC discharge thrusters or the floating potential in rf or microwave thrusters.
Sputter erosion of the screen grid then only becomes an issue at higher discharge voltages or
because of the production of high-energy ions in the hollow cathode region [5, 6] that can bombard
the screen grid. Likewise, the decel grid is biased near the beam plasma potential and back flowing
ions produced in the beam by charge exchange impact with very low energy, which causes little or
no sputtering. For two grid systems, the back flowing ions bombard the accel grid with essentially
the grid bias voltage. This can cause significant sputtering of the downstream face of the accel grid
and may determine the grid life.
The decelerating field produced downstream of the accelerator grid by the accel grid bias acts as a
weak defocusing lens for the ions, but keeps electrons emitted by the neutralizer from entering the
high field region and backstreaming at high energy into the discharge chamber. This decelerating
field is set up either by applying a potential between the accelerator grid and the decel grid, or by
applying the bias between the accelerator grid and the hollow cathode neutralizer and allowing the
low energy plasma downstream of the accelerator grid to act as a virtual anode. Unfortunately, ions
generated between the grids by either charge exchange with unionized neutral gas escaping the
plasma generator or by ionization from the most energetic backstreaming electrons do strike
the accel grid and erode it. Charge exchange ion erosion of the accel grid ultimately limits the grid
life, which will be discussed in Section 6.6.
6.2
Ion Accelerator Basics
The thruster ion optics assembly serves three main purposes:
1) Extract ions from the discharge chamber
2) Accelerate ions to generate thrust
3) Prevent electron backstreaming
The ideal grid assembly would extract and accelerate all the ions that approached the grids from
the plasma while blocking the neutral gas outflow, accelerate beams with long life and with high
current densities, and produce ion trajectories that are parallel to the thruster axis with no diver-
gence under various thermal conditions associated with changing power levels in the thruster. In
reality, grids are non-ideal in each of these areas. Grids have finite transparency; thus, some of the
discharge chamber ions hit the upstream “screen grid” and are not available to become part of the
beam. The screen grid transparency, Ts, is the ratio of the beam current Ib to the total ion current Ii
from the discharge chamber that approaches the screen grid:
Ts = Ib
Ii
(6.2-1)
This ratio is determined by comparing the ion beam current with the screen grid current. The trans-
parency depends on the plasma parameters in the discharge chamber because the hemispherical
sheath edge is normally pushed slightly into the plasma by the applied voltage if the screen grid is
relatively thin. The pre-sheath fields in the plasma edge then tend to steer some ions that would
have gone to the screen grid into the beam. For this reason, the effective transparency of the screen
grid typically exceeds the optical transparency for relatively large apertures and thin grid thick-
nesses. In addition, the screen grid current must be measured with the screen grid biased negative
relative to cathode potential to reflect energetic electrons in the tail of the Maxwellian distribution
234

in the plasma. The goal for screen grid design is to maximize the grid transparency to ions by mini-
mizing the screen thickness and the webbing between screen grid holes to that required for struc-
tural rigidity.
The maximum beam current density is limited by the ion space charge in the gap between the
screen and accelerator grids [2], which was discussed above with respect to the perveance that was
specified by the Child-Langmuir equation in which the sheath was considered essentially planar.
The problem is that the sheath shape in the screen aperture is not planar, as seen in Fig. 6-4, and the
exact shape and subsequent ion trajectories have to be solved by 2-D axial-symmetric codes. How-
ever, a modified sheath thickness can be used in the Child-Langmuir equation to approximately
account for this effect, in which the current density is written as

where VT is the total voltage across the sheath between the two grids and the sheath thickness le is

(6.2-3)
The grid dimensions in Eq. 6.2-3 are defined in Fig. 6-5. As illustrated in the figure, the sheath is
allowed to expand essentially spherically through the screen grid aperture. The sheath thickness le
accounts for this non-planar condition and has been found to be useful in predicting the space
charge limited current in ion thruster grid configurations [1, 7]. Note that the value of lg is the
“hot grid gap” that occurs once the grids have expanded into their final shape during operation
at a given beam current and voltage. For xenon ions, the maximum current density is

The units of the current density in the Child-Langmuir equation are Amperes divided by the

The maximum thrust per unit area possible from an ion thruster can also be found. Thrust was
defined in Chapter 2 for electric thrusters as

(6.2-5)
Assuming the ions start at rest, the ion velocity leaving the accelerator is

The maximum thrust density from an ion thruster increases with the screen grid transparency and
the square of the electric field [8]. Ion thrusters with thin, high transparency grids operating near
the perveance limit and at the maximum possible electric field in the acceleration gap will produce
the most thrust for a given grid area. A key feature of ion thrusters illustrated by Eq. 6.2-10 is that
the thrust density is independent of propellant mass.
The net-to-total voltage ratio from Eq. 6.2-9 is given by
R = Vb
VT
=
Vb
V s + V a
(6.2-11)
This equation describes the relative magnitude of the accel grid bias relative to the screen potential.
Operating with small values of R increases the total voltage between the screen and accel grids
which, from Eq. 6.2-2, results in a higher current density of ions accelerated from the thruster.
While it appears desirable to operate with very small values of R (large accel grid negative bias)
to increase the current capability of a grid set, this results in higher energy ion bombardment of
the accel grid and shortens grid life. Operating with small values of R will also change the beam
divergence, but this is a relatively small effect in ion thrusters for most grid designs. For applications
where thruster life is important, the magnitude of accel grid bias voltage is usually minimized to the
value required to just avoid electron backstreaming, and the value of R typically ranges from 0.8 to
0.9. Finally, Eq. 6.2-10 suggests that the thrust density depends on the square root of R and would
increase slowly with higher beam to total voltage ratios. This is misleading because the total voltage

also appears in the electric field term (E = VT/le), and so higher thrust densities actually occur with
more negative accel grid bias because of the higher voltage applied across the screen to accel gap for
a given net (beam) voltage.
Aside from mechanical tolerances, the minimum “hot-gap” grid separation, lg, is limited is by the
vacuum breakdown field of the grid material:
E = V
lg
< Ebreakdown
(6.2-12)
In practice, grid breakdowns initiated by arcing or small micro-discharges between the grids cause
“recycles” in which the voltages are temporarily removed to extinguish the arc and then reapplied.
It is common to also decrease the discharge plasma density during a recycle so that the reapplica-
tion of the acceleration voltages corresponds with ramping up the discharge current such that the
accelerator approximately tracks the right perveance during start up. This minimizes ion bombard-
ment of the accel grid during a recycle. To obtain reliable operation and avoid frequent recycles, the
maximum field strength in the ion thruster is typically set to less than half the vacuum breakdown
field. For example, if the grid spacing were a millimeter and the acceleration potential between
the grids a thousand volts, the theoretical maximum xenon ion beam current density would be
15 mA/cm2. A 25 cm diameter, uniform-profile beam with a 75% transparent grid system would
then produce about 5.5 A of beam current. In practice, because of high voltage breakdown consid-
erations, the maximum beam current obtainable from grid sets is typically about half the theoretical
maximum.
The ion thruster size is determined by the perveance limit on the beam current density and prac-
tical considerations on the grids such as maximum grid transparency and electric field [1]. For this
reason, ion thruster beam current densities are typically on the order of a tenth that found in Hall
thrusters, resulting in a larger thruster footprint on the spacecraft. Alternatively, the maximum Isp
that is achievable is limited by the voltage that can be applied to the grids to extract a given current
density before electrical breakdown or electron backstreaming occurs [9]. Very high Isp thrusters
(>10,000 s), with a size that depends on the thrust requirement, have been built and successfully
tested.
6.3
Ion Optics
While the simple formulas above provide estimates of the ion accelerator optics performance, a
number of computer simulation codes have been developed [4, 10–17] to more accurately evaluate
the ion trajectories produced by thruster grids. Ion optics codes solve in two or three dimensions the
combined ion charge density and Poisson’s equations for the given grid geometry and beamlet para-
meters [18]. These codes have been used for the design and analysis of two- and three-grid systems,
and were extended to four-grid systems [19] to examine “two-stage” ion optics performance [20] for
very high voltage, high Isp applications.
6.3.1
Ion Trajectories
There are a number of codes that calculate ion trajectories and grid performance in ion thrusters,
and an extensive analysis of ion optics behavior in thrusters was recently completed by Farnell [21].
An example of a multi-dimensional code is CEX, which is an ion optics code developed at JPL that
calculates ion trajectories and charge exchange reactions between beam ions and un-ionized
6.3 Ion Optics
237

propellant gas in two [4] and three [17] dimensions. The CEX-2D code solves Poisson’s equation,
given by Eq. 3.7-8 in Chapter 3, on a regular mesh in cylindrical geometry. The code models a single
set of screen and accel grid holes, and assumes cylindrical symmetry. The computational space is
divided into a grid of rectangular cells with up to 400 increments radially and 600 axially. The radial
grid spacing is uniform; the axial spacing is allowed to increase in the downstream direction. The
computational region is typically a few millimeters radially and up to 10 cm along the axis down-
stream of the final grid. With a few exceptions, the code uses a combination of algorithms used in
earlier optics codes for ion thrusters [11–15].
Upstream of the accelerator grid, the electron density is obtained analytically from Eq. 3.5-10
assuming a Maxwellian electron distribution:
ne V = ne 0 e
ϕ −ϕo
Te
(6.3-1)
The upstream reference electron density, ne(0), is set equal to the input discharge chamber
ion density. Downstream of the accelerator grid, the electron population is also assumed to be a
Maxwellian with a different reference potential:
ne V = ne ∞e
ϕ −ϕ ∞
Te
(6.3-2)
where the downstream reference electron density, ne(∞),is set equal to the calculated average
downstream ion beam density. As a result, downstream potentials are determined self-consistently;
there is no need to assume a neutralization plane. These codes include focusing effects and the fact
that the aperture dimensions are usually significantly larger than the gap size such that the electric
fields are reduced from the ideal maximum.
The potential distributions are calculated using an optimized pre-conditioned least square con-
jugate gradient sparse matrix solver. Results for a given upstream plasma number density, n, are
found by starting from zero density and iterating. At each iteration, i, a fraction, α, of the desired
discharge chamber ion density is blended into the code:
n0 = 0
ni + 1 = 1 −α ni + αn
(6.3-3)
The density that the code uses asymptotically approaches the final density:
n −ni = n 1 −α i
(6.3-4)
If α is sufficiently small, approximate results for all upstream densities less then n can be obtained in
a single run:
ni = 1 −1 −α i n
(6.3-5)
By saving the intermediate results, only a single run is needed to estimate the performance of an
optics design over a wide range of discharge chamber densities. However, since the calculation is
fully converged only at the final density, separate runs with different final densities may be neces-
sary to obtain accurate results over the full range of discharge chamber ion densities. A typical CEX-
2D calculation takes a few minutes on a personal computer. Ion optic assemblies designed using the
CEX-2D code have met the predicted performance very closely [4], illustrating that grid design tech-
niques are very mature.
The ion density in the beamlet is obtained in the codes by tracking representative ion trajectories
and accounting for charge exchange collisions that alter the ion energy. Ions enter the
238
6 Ion Thruster Accelerators

computational region from the upstream boundary at the Bohm velocity, and their charge density is
found by following their trajectories in a stationary electric field. This is in contrast to the time
dependent Particle-In-Cell (PIC) technique generally used in plasma physics simulations.
An example of ion trajectories calculated by CEX-2D is shown in Fig. 6-6, which shows the com-
putational space with the dimensions given in meters used for three values of beam perveance for
half a beamlet in a three-grid configuration. In this figure, ions from the discharge chamber enter
from the left and are accelerated by the electric field between the screen and accel grids. The hor-
izontal boundaries represent lines of symmetry such that an ion crossing at these boundaries has
another ion coming in from outside the domain. The top figure (a) shows an over- perveance con-
dition representing too high a beamlet current for the applied voltage, or too low a voltage for the
plasma density and ion current provided. In this case, ions directly impinge on the upstream face of
the accel grid. This situation is considered to be the perveance limit, where excessive ion current

strikes the accel grid. The middle figure (b) shows a near-optimum perveance condition where the
ions are well focuses through the accel and decel grid apertures, and do not directly intercept any
downstream grid. Finally, the bottom figure (c) shows an under-perveance condition where the ions
are over focused and cross over in the accel gap. In this case, ions can directly intercept the accel grid
and, eventually, the decel grid as the apertures wear open. Note that the length of the computa-
tional region shown must be long compared to its radius and is usually chosen so that neighboring
beamlets will overlap.
A fraction of the ions from the plasma at the largest radii run directly into the screen grid, as seen
in Fig. 6-6, and do not enter into the thrust beam. These ions represent the effect of the finite screen
grid transparency that was so important in the discharge loss calculations in Chapter 5. For the
near-optimal and under-perveance conditions, the screen grid transparency is greater than its geo-
metric open area fraction, as mentioned above, because the self-consistent electric fields actually
extract some of the ions at large radii that would have hit the screen grid instead of going into the
screen aperture.
6.3.2
Perveance Limits
Figure 6-6 demonstrated that electrostatic accelerators produce focused ion trajectories when oper-
ated near a given design perveance and avoid grid interception or large beam divergence angles over
a limited range of voltages and currents that are related by space charge considerations in the grid
gap. In ion thrusters, operating sufficiently away from the perveance design of the grids results in
beam interception on the downstream accel and (eventually) decel grids. Figure 6-7 shows an illus-
tration of the accel grid current as a function of the current in a beamlet (a single aperture) for three
different beam voltages. In this case, the optics were designed to run at about 2 kV and 0.8 mA of
beamlet current, and the design demonstrates low grid interception over about ±50% of this cur-
rent. As the beamlet current is increased, by raising the plasma density in the discharge chamber,
the sheath thickness in the acceleration gap decreases, which flattens the sheath and causes the
accel grid interception to increase. Eventually, the system becomes under-focused at the perveance
limit where a large fraction of the beamlet is intercepted, as shown in Fig. 6-6a. The accel grid

current then increases rapidly with beamlet current due to the system running at too high a per-
veance. At low discharge chamber plasma densities, which produce low beamlet currents, the beam
is over-focused and interception of the ions on the accel grid due to cross-over trajectories increases
the accel grid current. The ion trajectories for this case are shown in Fig. 6-6c.
At the nominal beam voltage of 2 kV, this system can be run from about 0.4–1.2 mA of beamlet
current between the cross-over and perveance limits without producing excessive accel grid cur-
rent. If the ion thruster has a current profile of greater than about 3:1 peak to edge over the grid
diameter (due to a poor plasma density uniformity), then grid interception will occur either in the
center or at the edge of the beam. Since the grids are normally designed to deal with the high per-
veance condition at the peak current density near the axis, poor plasma profiles usually result in
significant erosion of the edge holes due to cross-over interception. This will impact the life of the
thruster and must be compensated by either changing the grid gap or beamlet aperture sizes as
function of the radius or modifying the plasma generator to produce more uniform profiles.
Increasing the beam voltage shifts the curves in Fig. 6-7 to higher beamlet currents. This is clear
from the dependence in the Child-Langmuir equation (Eq. 6.3-2) where the current scales as V3/2 if
the sheath thickness and grid dimensions are held constant. In Fig. 6-7, the perveance-limited
beamlet current, where direct grid interception occurs, increases as V3/2 as the beam voltage is
raised. Figure 6-7 also illustrates that in situations where the thruster power must decrease, which
is typical of deep space solar electric propulsion missions where the power available decreases as the
spacecraft moves away from the sun, the beam voltage and Isp of the thruster must eventually
decrease as the current is reduced to avoid grid interception.
The voltage range available from a given accelerator design at a fixed (or nearly constant) beam
current has similar limitations as the current dependence just discussed. However, the minimum
voltage at a given current is of special interest in an ion thruster because this is related to the
minimum Isp of the engine for a given thrust. The perveance-limit of a thruster is usually defined
relative to the rate at which the accel current increases due to interception as the beam voltage is
decreased:

(6.3-6)
This is related to the optics situation illustrated in Fig. 6-6a where the current at a given voltage is
too high for the designed gap and aperture size and the under-focused beamlet starts to directly
intercept accel grid. Figure 6-8 shows the behavior of the accel grid current for the NSTAR engine
operating at the full power parameters of TH15 but with the screen voltage decreasing. In this case,
the perveance limit is found to be at 688.8 V, compared to the nominal 1100 V of the screen voltage
at this throttle level. The perveance limit can also be defined by a given percentage increase in the
accel current. However, the screen grid transparency usually decreases as the screen power supply
voltage is decreased, which reduces the beam current and accel current during this measurement.
The magnitude of the percentage increase in the accel current due to direct ion impingement then
needs to be defined for the ion optics assembly.
6.3.3
Grid Expansion and Alignment
A significant issue in ion thrusters that utilize refractory metal grids is thermal expansion of the
grids during thruster operation changing the acceleration gap dimension between the screen
and accel grids. This will directly affect the ion trajectories and the perveance of the ion optics. Since
the screen grid is heated by direct contact with the discharge plasma, and is usually dished outwards
6.3 Ion Optics
241

and designed with a minimum thickness to increase the effective transparency, the screen grid
expansion is usually larger than the accel grid and the gap tends to decrease as the thruster heats
up. This shift from the cold gap to the hot gap causes the perveance of the optics to increase for
convex grid curvature (grids domed outward from the thruster body) and changes the beamlet tra-
jectories at the given operating point. In addition, for grids designed to hold the applied voltage
across the cold gap, the hot gap may be so small that field emission and high voltage breakdown
become problems. For ion thrusters with refractory metal grids designed with concave grid curva-
ture (grids domed into the thruster body), the screen grid expands away from the accel grid and the
perveance decreases as the gap gets larger. In addition, concave grids have a smaller discharge
chamber volume for a given thruster size, which adversely affects the discharge loss.
Ideally, the ion optics design would have sufficient margin to operate at full power over the range
that the grid gap changes. This is possible for smaller thrusters and/or lower power levels where the
grid deflection is a small fraction of cold gap. For thrusters with grid diameters greater than 15–20
cm operating at power levels in excess of 1 kW, it is often necessary to design the optics for the high-
est power case with the small hot gap, and start the thruster in the diode-mode (discharge only) or at
lower beam powers to pre-heat the grids to avoid breakdown during thermal motion and establish
the grid gap dimension within the range the optics can tolerate for high power operation with min-
imal grid interception. It should be noted that grids fabricated from the various forms of carbon
(graphite, carbon-carbon composite, or pyrolytic) have smaller or negligible thermal expansion
than refractory metal grids and will have smaller grid gap changes. Ion optics sets that utilize grids
made of two different materials have to deal with this issue of different thermal expansion coeffi-
cients and potentially larger grid gap changes.
Another significant grid issue is alignment of the grid apertures. The ion trajectories shown in
Fig. 6-6 assumed perfect alignment of the screen and accel grid apertures, and the resultant trajec-
tories are then axisymmetric along the aperture centerline. Displacement of the accel grid aperture
relative to the screen grid centerline causes an off-axis deflection of the ion trajectories, commonly
called beam steering. The effect of aperture displacement on the beamlet steering has been inves-
tigated for many years in both ion sources and ion thrusters [22–25]. The beamlet is steered in the

direction opposite to the aperture displacement due to the higher focusing electric field induced at
the accel grid aperture edge. Studies of this effect in ion thruster grid geometries [24] show that
small aperture displacements (≈10% of the screen aperture diameter) cause a deflection in the
beamlet angle of up to about 5 . This phenomenon can be used to compensate for the curvature
of the grids to reduce the overall beam divergence, which is called compensation. However, the per-
veance of the aperture is reduced in this case and interception of edge ions on the accel grid due
to the non-uniform electric fields can be an issue. Mechanical misalignment of the grids due to
manufacturing tolerances or thermal deformation can also produce aperture displacement and
unintended beamlet steering. This problem has been identified as the cause of thrust vector varia-
tions observed as thrusters heat up [24], and for the production of azimuthal ion velocities that
produce “swirl torque” on the spacecraft. For this reason, precise alignment of the grid apertures
and grid support mechanisms that minimize non-uniform thermal deformation are generally
required to provide stable ion optics performance with minimal beam divergence.
6.4
Electron Backstreaming
Downstream of the accelerator grid, the ion beam is charge and current neutralized by electrons
from the neutralizer hollow cathode. Since electrons are much more mobile than ions, a potential
barrier is needed to stop neutralizer electrons from flowing back into the positively biased discharge
chamber. In the absence of a potential barrier, the electron current would be several hundred times
the ion current, wasting essentially all of the electrical power. The potential barrier is produced by
the negatively biased accel grid. The minimum potential established by the accel grid prevents all
but the highest energy electrons from traveling backwards from the beam plasma into the discharge
chamber. The so-called “backstreaming” electron current is not only a parasitic power loss since
these electrons do not add thrust, but they can damage the thruster by overheating the internal
component of the discharge chamber such as the cathode.
The accel grid bias voltage required to limit the electron backstreaming current to a small value
(typically <1% of the beam current) can be determined by evaluating Poisson’s equation in the grid
aperture in the presence of the beamlet ion current with 2-D computer codes. An example of such a
calculation is shown in Fig. 6-9 where the potential between the electrodes and on the axis of the
half-beamlet is shown. Note that the potential minimum in the center of the beamlet is only a small
fraction of the applied accel grid voltage in this example, which is due to the beam’s space charge.
The actual value of this minimum potential determines the margin to backstreaming, which should
be set well above the value at which excessive backstreaming occurs.
Examining electron backstreaming in more detail shows that the minimum potential in the accel
grid is determined by three factors: The electrostatic potential from the bias voltages applied to the
different grids, the beamlet space charge in the accel grid aperture, and the required potential dif-
ference between the beam plasma and minimum voltage to reduce the backstreaming electron cur-
rent to insignificant levels. Each of these factors can be evaluated analytically using simplifying
approximations to help in understanding backstreaming physics.
As stated above, the backstreaming electron current results from the tail of the beam Maxwellian
electron distribution overcoming the potential barrier established in the accel grid aperture. The
current of electrons backstreaming into the thruster plasma is just the beam plasma random elec-
tron flux times the Boltzmann factor for the potential difference between the beam plasma and the
minimum potential in the accel grid region [26]:

This equation describes the required potential difference between the beam potential and the min-

values of the beam plasma electron temperature in a thruster plume with a net accelerating voltage
of Vp −Vbp = 1500 V. For an electron temperature of 2 eV in the beam, which is consistent with
values found in NSTAR thruster plumes [27], a potential difference between the minimum
potential in the beamlet and the beam plasma of only 12.5 V is required to reduce the
backstreaming current to 1% of the beam current.
The actual minimum potential in the beamlet is determined by the grid geometry, the applied
grid potentials, and the beam’s space charge. The minimum potential in the two-grid

and le is given by Eq. 6.3-3. Eq. 6.4-5 provides the dependence on the geometry of the grids, but is
only useful if the beam space charge is negligible (very low current density beamlets).
The reduction in the magnitude of the minimum beam potential due to the presence of the ion

encloses volume V. This equation is solved first in the beamlet, then in the charge-free space
between the beamlet and the accel aperture inside diameter, and then adding the two potentials
together gives the total potential between the grid and the beamlet centerline.
Assume that the beamlet has a radius db/2 inside the accel grid aperture with a radius of da/2.

In practice, the onset of backstreaming is determined by two techniques. One method is to monitor
the increase in the screen power supply current as the magnitude of the accel grid voltage is
decreased. Increases in the measured current are due to backstreaming electrons, and a 1% increase
is defined as the minimum accel grid voltage to avoid backstreaming: the so-called backstreaming
limit. For example, the power supply current from Eq. 6.4-17, normalized to the initial beam cur-
rent, is plotted in Fig. 6-11 as a function of the accel grid voltage for the NSTAR ion optics [29] for
the maximum power throttle point TH15 at the beginning of life (BOL). In this figure, the beam
potential and electron temperature were assumed to be 12 V and 2 eV respectively, consistent with
measurements made on this thruster. The onset of backstreaming occurs at about −150 V on the
accel grid, which is consistent with the data from tests of this engine [30, 31].
A second method to determine the backstreaming limit is to monitor the ion production cost,
which is the discharge power required to produce the ion beam current divided by the beam cur-
rent. This is an effective method for use in thrusters operating in the beam current regulated mode
where the discharge power supply is controlled to fix the beam current. Backstreaming then
appears as a decrease in the ion production cost. This method is shown in Fig. 6-12 for the exper-
imental data taken from the NSTAR thruster at TH15. As the magnitude of the accel voltage is
decreased, a 1% decrease in the ion production cost represents the defined onset of backstreaming.

In this case, the backstreaming limit was determined to be about -148 V, consistent with the above
analytical model.
Equations 6.4-17 and 6.4-18 show that the electron backstreaming is a function of the accel grid
hole diameter. Increases in the accel hole diameter will reduce the penetration of the applied grid
bias voltage to the center of the aperture and reduce the minimum potential on axis. The larger
accel hole diameter increases either the backstreaming current at a given voltage, or the back-
streaming limit at a given current. The effect of accel grid hole enlargement due to grid-wear is
illustrated in Fig. 6-13, where the grid voltage at which backstreaming started is plotted versus accel

grid hole diameter for the NSTAR TH15 case measured during the ELT life test [31]. Larger grid-
hole diameters required more negative biasing of the accel grid to avoid the onset of backstreaming.
Figure 6-13 also shows an interesting effect in that the shape of the grid hole is important. Early in
life, the grid aperture diameter eroded due to sputtering, and the barrel diameter was adequately
described by the minimum hole diameter observed optically during running of the test. However, as
the test progressed, the erosion of the upstream aperture edge essentially stopped and the aperture
was observed to be chamfered on the downstream portion. An effective grid diameter had to be
calculated to take into account the non-uniform hole erosion in determining the backstreaming
onset, shown on the right-hand-side of Fig. 6-13. While the analytical model above accounts for
grid diameter and thickness, additional terms would have to be added to account for this conical
erosion shape. This situation is best handled by 2-D models that determine both the time dependent
shape of the grid hole and calculate the potential on axis appropriately.
It should be noted that while the analytical model shown above illustrates the mechanisms
involved in electron backstreaming and provides reasonable agreement with the experimental data
shown, the results are very sensitive to the dimensions and beam parameters assumed in the cal-
culation. This is largely because the potential minimum is the difference between two large num-
bers representing the contributions of the electrostatic fields and the space charge fields. Therefore,
this backstreaming model actually provides only an estimate of the backstreaming voltage and cur-
rent levels, which can easily be off 10–20%. The 2-D grid codes described above that solve Poisson’s
equation exactly provide more accurate calculations of the backstreaming limit.
Finally, electron backstreaming occurs first in the region of the highest beamlet current where
the ion space charge is the highest in the ion optics assembly. Thrusters with non-uniform beam
profiles, such as NSTAR with a flatness parameter (defined as average to peak current density) of
about 0.5 and therefore a 2:1 peak to average current density profile [30], will tend to backstream
primarily from the center beamlets. This localized backstreaming accelerates electrons on-axis and
can overheat components such as the cathode at the center-back of the thruster. Thrusters designed
to have flat profiles, such as NEXIS with better than a 0.9 flatness parameter [32], will tend to not
backstream easily because of a lower peak ion current density for a given total beam current, and
also, if backstreaming starts, it will be over a larger area that minimizes the localized heating issue
in the discharge chamber.
6.5
High Voltage Considerations
As shown in Section 6.3, the maximum thrust that can be produced by an ion thruster is a function
of the electric field that can be sustained between the screen and accelerator grids:
Tmax = 8
9 εo γ Ts Ag
R E2
(6.5-1)
From Eq. 6.5-1, the maximum space charge limited (sometimes called perveance-limited) thrust of
the accelerator system is directly proportional to the intra-grid electric field squared. To produce
compact ion thrusters with the highest possible thrust, it is necessary to maximize the electric field
between the grids. The maximum thrust in ion engines is then limited primarily by the voltage hold-
off capability of the grids.
The ability of the accelerator grids to hold off high voltage reliably and to withstand occasional
breakdowns without significant damage or loss of voltage standoff capability is therefore of critical
importance for ion thrusters. The high voltage behavior of vacuum-compatible materials has been
6.5 High Voltage Considerations
249

summarized in recent books on high-voltage engineering [33, 34]. In plasma devices [35], electric
fields of up to 40 kV/cm were found useful for refractory metal electrodes and the order of 25 kV/cm
for carbon materials. Degradation of the voltage hold-off due to surface damage incurred during
breakdowns has been investigated for molybdenum and carbon electrodes [35] commonly used
in ion thruster applications. The surfaces of these materials can be carefully prepared to withstand
high electric fields required to produce the highest thrust density. However, sputter erosion over
time and electrical breakdowns between grids causes some fraction of the stored energy in the
power supply to be deposited on the grid surface. The formation of an arc at the cathode electrode
(the accel grid) and the deposition of a significant amount of electron power from discharge into the
anode electrode (the screen grid) can cause both the screen and accel grid surfaces to be modified
and/or damaged. The breakdown events usually impact the subsequent voltage hold-off capability
of the grid surfaces, which affects the long-term performance of the thruster.
6.5.1
Electrode Breakdown
The grids in ion thrusters have high voltages applied across small grid gaps, which can lead to high
voltage breakdown and unreliable thruster operation. High voltage breakdown is usually described
in terms of the electric field applied to the surface that causes an arc or discharge to start. Arc ini-
tiation is well correlated to the onset of field emission [36, 37]. If sufficient field emission occurs due
to excessive voltage or a modification to the surface that enhances field emission, the gap breaks
down. Physical damage to arced surfaces during the breakdown is attributed to localized energy
deposition on the electrode that causes melting or evaporation of the material. On the cathode sur-
face (the accel grid), the energy is deposited primarily by ion bombardment from the arc-plasma.
On the anode surface (the screen grid), the energy is deposited from the plasma or electron stream
that crosses the gap and results in localized surface heating and vaporization. The energy provided
to the arc from the power supply is distributed between any series resistance in the electrical circuit,
the voltage drop at the cathode surface, and the voltage drop in the plasma discharge and anode
sheath. These voltage drops can be modeled using discrete series resistances in the energy balance
of the system. Engineers often rate the possibility of a power supply damaging the electrodes by the
amount of stored energy in the power supply. However, the amount of material removed from the
surfaces and the lifetime of high voltage electrodes is usually characterized [35] by the amount of
current that passes through the arc. This “Coulomb-transfer rating” is related to the energy depo-
sition in the electrodes in a simple manner. The power running in the arc is P = I Varc, where I is the
discharge current and Varc is the voltage drop in the arc. Assuming that most of the voltage drop is in
the cathode sheath, the energy E deposited by the arc on the cathode surface is
E =
P dt =
IVarcdt
(6.5-2)
The voltage drop of refractory metal and graphite arcs is nearly independent of the amount of
current running in the arc up to several hundred Amperes[38, 39]. Therefore the arc voltage can
be considered to be essentially a constant, and the energy deposited by the arc on the cathode is
E = Varc
Idt = V arc Q,
(6.5-3)
where Q is the total charge transferred in the arc. The arc energy deposited on the cathode surface
for a given electrode material is characterized by the total charge transferred by the thruster power
supplies during the arc time, and not just the stored energy in the power supply. Assuming that the
arc remains lit during the entire time required to discharge the output capacitor in the power
250
6 Ion Thruster Accelerators

supply, the total charge transferred through the arc is Q = CV, where C is the capacitance and V is
the capacitor charging voltage. If the arc current falls below the minimum value to sustain the arc,
called the “chopping current”, and is prematurely extinguished, then the total charge transferred is
reduced.
It should be emphasized that the amount of energy delivered to the cathode surface by the arc and
the amount of damage to the surface incurred by material removal are independent of any series
resistance in the circuit as long as the current is stable for the duration of the event (i.e. the current
is above the chopping current). This means that simply adding a series resistor to one leg of the high
voltage power supply circuit or the accel grid circuit will not reduce the surface damage due to an
arc unless the arc current drops to less than the chopping current. The only mechanism that reduces
surface damage if the current is large compared to the chopping current is to limit the total charge
transfer. This requires either reducing the power supply capacitance at a given voltage (which
reduces the total stored energy), or actively shunting or opening the circuit to reduce the arc
duration.
6.5.2
Molybdenum Electrodes
Molybdenum is a standard electrode material used in ion thrusters due to its low sputter erosion
rate, ability to be chemically etched to form the aperture array, and good thermal and structural
properties. The surface of the molybdenum grid is often slightly texturized to retain sputtered mate-
rial to avoid flaking of the sputter-deposited material [40]. The threshold voltage for the onset of
field emission versus the gap spacing measured for molybdenum electrodes using a standard
“plate-and-ball” test arrangement in a high vacuum facility [41] is shown Fig. 6-14. The data shows
a classic power-law dependence of the threshold voltage with gap spacing for small gaps, which is
sometimes called the “total voltage effect”[42]. Although there are numerous possible mechanisms
for the total-voltage effect, the increased gap reduces the surface electric field and the field emission
current but increases the probability of an atom or particulate being ionized while traversing the
gap. The ionized atom or particle is then accelerated into the cathode potential electrode and pro-
duces secondary electrons. If sufficient ionizations and secondary electrons are produced, the

process cascades and the gap breaks-down. Therefore, the voltage that can be held across a gap does
not increase linearly with the gap dimension. This is equivalent to the Paschen breakdown [34]
mechanism in gas filled devices and is caused by the release of gases or particulates from the sur-
faces in vacuum gaps. After 10 arcs of 1 mC in charge transfer, the threshold voltage was measured
again and the threshold voltage is observed to increase for every gap tested, indicating that the sur-
face is being conditioned. Improving voltage standoff of electrodes with a series of low Coulomb-
transfer arcs is common practice in the high voltage industry and often historically called “spot-
knocking”. This process removes small field emitters and tends to clean oxides and impurities
off the surface without damaging the surface, which reduces the onset of field emission. Higher
Coulomb transfer arcs on molybdenum (10 and 20 mC) improve the voltage hold-off by cleaning
larger areas of the surface and removing field emission sites. This effect will continue until the sur-
face is well conditioned, or the arc anchors in one spot and causes damage to the surface.
As the gap between the electrodes increases, the threshold voltage curves become more linear and
the surface asymptotes to a constant threshold electric field. Figure 6-15 shows the threshold elec-
tric field for large gaps for a flat molybdenum surface texturized by grit blasting and actual textur-
ized grid material with apertures chemically etched into the material. In this case, high Coulomb
transfer arcs tend to damage and degrade the voltage standoff of the grids. Scanning electron

microscope photographs show localized damage to the edge of the beam apertures, resulting in
more field emission sites. The molybdenum surfaces are initially capable of holding electric fields
of well over 200 kV/cm, but the surface roughening to retain flakes and the aperture edges associ-
ated with real grids cause the voltage hold off to decrease. For molybdenum material with aper-
tures, the resulting surface is susceptible to breakdown at electric fields of 40–50 kV/cm, which
should be considered the maximum electric field for designing molybdenum grids.
6.5.3
Carbon-Carbon Composite Materials
Carbon is a desirable material for ion thruster grid electrodes because of its low sputtering yield
under xenon ion bombardment [43] compared to most refractory grid materials. However, the
structural properties of graphite are usually insufficient for thin graphite grids of any reasonable
size (greater than about 20 cm dia.) to survive launch vibrations. Relatively thick accel grids made
of high density graphite are used in the 22-cm-dia. T6 ion thruster [44, 45], but screen grids of
molybdenum had to be used in that thruster because thin graphite grids were found to be too fragile
to survive launch loads. Producing thin graphite screen grids and grid sets with large diameters are
made possible by using carbon material such as carbon-carbon composites and pyrolytic graphite
with better structural properties. Carbon-carbon (CC) composite grids have been fabricated with
over 50-cm diameter [46], demonstrated low erosion in life tests and flown successfully [47]. How-
ever, the more complex structure of these materials leads to lower thresholds for field emission and
less voltage standoff for grids made of these materials.
Carbon-carbon composite material used for both screen and accel grid electrodes [48] is based on
carbon fibers woven into a matrix with the fibers oriented in one or two dimensions. This material
has enhanced strength and flexural modulus compared to pure graphite due to the carbon fiber
properties. The carbon-fiber weave is impregnated with a resin and built up to the desired shape
by progressive laminate layers on a mold. The resulting material is usually densified and graphi-
tized at high temperature, and may be further impregnated or over-coated with a thin CVD carbon
layer after this process to fill any voids or smooth the final surface. High voltage breakdown tests
were conducted with and without this final surface graphite coating.
The threshold voltage of the carbon-carbon composite samples is shown in Fig. 6-16, where the
threshold for field emission is plotted as a function of the electrode gap for various levels of
Coulomb-transfer arcing. New material (without arcing) with a fresh CVD layer has a high thresh-
old for field emission, and therefore holds voltage well. High Coulomb-transfer arcs (>1 mC) tend
to damage that surface and return it to the state of the material without the CVD over-layer. Higher
Coulomb-transfer arcs also tended to damage the surface. In fact, in this example, the 10 mC arcs
resulted in damage to the opposite anode electrode, which evaporated and re-deposited material
back on the cathode potential surface, improving its voltage hold off capability. For this reason,
the Coulomb-transfer limit for CC grids should be set to about 1 mC such that conditioning and
no damage to either screen or accel grid occurs during any breakdowns.
The threshold electric field for CC material with grid apertures is shown in Fig. 6-17 for new
material and after a series of arcs. After the initial characterization with 10 arcs of 1 mC each, 10 arcs
of 10 mC were delivered to the surface, which degraded the voltage standoff. However, the appli-
cation of 4 sets of 10 arcs of only 1 mC re-conditioned the surface. The threshold electric field was
found to asymptote to just below the same 40 kV/cm field at larger gap sizes observed for low
Coulomb-transfer arcs of flat material, suggesting that the aperture edges function in a similar man-
ner as material roughness. These results suggest that carbon-carbon composite grids can be
designed for reliable high voltage standoff utilizing a field emission threshold of about 35 kV/cm,
even for large gaps and voltages in excess of 10 kV, provided that the Coulomb transfer is limited

by the power supply to less than about 1 mC. This 35-kV/cm field-limit is the highest voltage stress
that should be allowed, and conservative design practices suggest that a 50% margin (to ≈23 kV/cm)
should be considered in designing these types of grids.
6.5.4
Pyrolytic Graphite
Pyrolytic graphite (PG) is also a candidate for accelerator grid electrodes in ion thrusters [49]. This
material is configured with the carbon crystal planes parallel to the surface. Pyrolytic graphite is
grown a layer at a time to near the desired shape on a mandrel and then finished machined to

the final configuration. Flat test coupons were fabricated in this manner, but featured small surface
bumps and depressions that were residual from the growth process. Figure 6-18 shows the behavior
of a PG grid sample that had apertures laser-machined into it and then the surface lightly grit-
blasted. The as-new PG material demonstrated threshold electric fields of 20–30 kV/cm for gaps
of 1 mm or larger, which is lower than that found for the CC grid material. However, a series of
ten 1 mC arcs tend to smooth and condition the surface and raise the threshold electric field to
the order of 30 kV/cm. Higher Coulomb arcs (up to about 10 mC) also improve the voltage stand
off to about 40 kV/cm. The pyrolytic graphite is more susceptible to field emission and breakdown
that the carbon-carbon material, but appears to tolerate higher Coulomb-transfer arcs.
6.5.5
Voltage Hold-off and Conditioning in Ion Accelerators
Tests have shown that the arc initiation voltage is directly related to the threshold voltage and elec-
tric field for field emission in the above figures [35]. Arc initiation voltages tend to be less than 10%
higher than the threshold values for field emission shown here. This is consistent with experimental
observations that low levels of field emission and/or corona can be tolerated before full arc break-
down occurs, but arcing and recycling tend to increase once significant field emission starts. Molyb-
denum has been found to have a good tolerance for high Coulomb-transfer arcs, and grids can be
designed to reliably hold electric fields well in excess of 40 kV/cm. Carbon based materials have
more structure than the refractory metals and tend to form field emitters if excessive charge trans-
fers are allowed. Nevertheless, grids utilizing carbon-based materials can be designed with electric
fields in excess of 20 kV/cm if the Coulomb transfer during breakdowns is limited to about 1 mC or
less. Detailed investigations of the voltage hold-off and conditioning of carbon-carbon thruster grids
were performed by Martinez [8], who documented the effect for larger area grid sets. Figure 6-19
shows their reduction in field emission from carbon-carbon grids plotted on a Fowler-Nordheim
plot [42] for increasing numbers of 1-mC arcs. This work shows that even if the surface of
carbon-carbon grids evolve field emitters over time due to erosion from ion bombardment, proper
design of the power supply to limit the Coulomb-transfer rate will result in reconditioning of the
grid surfaces with every recycle event.

6.6
Ion Accelerator Grid Life
The most import wear mechanism in modern ion thrusters is accelerator grid erosion. Even though
properly designed optics attempt to make all of the ions extracted from the discharge chamber focus
through the accelerator grid apertures, a current of secondary ions generated downstream of the
discharge chamber impacts the accelerator grid. These secondary ions are generated by resonant
charge exchange (CEX) between beam ions and neutral propellant gas escaping from the discharge
chamber. The cross section for resonant charge exchange, that is the transfer of an electron from a
propellant atom to a beamlet ion, is very large; on the order of a hundred square Angstroms [50] for
xenon. This process results in a fast neutral atom in the beam and a slow thermal ion. These slow
ions are attracted to the negatively charged accelerator grid, and most hit with sufficient energy to
sputter material from the grid. Eventually the accelerator grid apertures become too large to prevent
electron backstreaming, or enough material is sputtered away that the grids fail structurally.
The erosion geometry is naturally divided into two regions. The first region, barrel erosion, is
caused by ions generated between the screen grid aperture sheath and the downstream surface
of the accelerator grid as shown in Fig. 6-20. Charge exchange ions generated in this region impact

the inside surface of accelerator grid aperture and results in enlargement of the aperture barrel. As
the barrel diameter increases, the grid must be biased more and more negatively to establish the
minimum potential required in the aperture to prevent neutralizer electrons from backstreaming
into the discharge chamber. Thruster failure occurs when, at its maximum voltage, the accelerator
grid power supply is unable to stop electron backstreaming.
The second region of grid erosion is caused by charge exchange ions generated downstream of the
accelerator. Since the beamlets are long and thin, inside each beamlet the radial electric forces dom-
inate and expel the slow, charge-exchange ions into the gaps between the beamlets. Charge
exchange ions generated in the region before the beamlets merge to form a continuous ion density
are then attracted back to the accelerator grid by its large negative potential. This is illustrated in
Fig. 6-21. On impact, these ions sputter away material from the downstream surface of the accel-
erator grid. Sputter erosion by these backstreaming ions results in a hexagonal “pits and groves”
erosion pattern on the downstream grid surface, which can lead to structural failure of the grids
if the erosion penetrates all the way through the grid. Erosion of the accel grid aperture edge by
backstreaming ions can also effectively enlarge the accel grid aperture diameter, leading to the
onset of electron backstreaming.
Erosion of the accelerator grid by charge exchange ion sputtering was the major life limiting
mechanism observed during the Extended Life Test (ELT) of the NSTAR flight spare thruster
[51] for operation at the highest power TH15 level. Photographs of center holes in the grid at
the beginning and the end of the 30,000-h test are shown in Fig. 6-22 where barrel-erosion enlarge-
ment of the aperture diameters is evident. Note that the triangle patterns where the webbing inter-
sects in the end-of-test picture are locations where the erosion has completely penetrated the grid.
The SEM photograph shown in Fig. 6-23 illustrates the deep erosion of the pit-and-groves pattern
and that full penetration of the grid had occurred when the test was stopped. Continued operation
would have eventually resulted in structural failure of the grid, but this was not considered immi-
nent at the end of the test.
6.6.1
Grid Models
As discussed above, the primary erosion mechanism of the accelerator grid is caused by sputtering
from charge exchange ions. At the simplest level, all that is needed to predict erosion rates is to
calculate the number of ions generated in the beamlets, find where they hit the grids, and then
to determine the amount of material that they sputter. The total calculated charge exchange ion
current accounts for nearly all the measured accelerator grid current in a properly designed ion
thruster (i.e. no direct interception of the beam current). The measured accelerator grid current
in flight on NASA’s NSTAR thruster during the Deep Space 1 Mission [52, 53] ranged from 0.2

to 0.3% of the total beam current, which is shown in Fig. 6-24. Accel grid currents on the order of 1%
or less of the beam current are standard in most ion thrusters.
Calculating the ion generation rate in the grid region due to charge exchange is relatively straight-
forward. The charge exchange currents generated by a single aperture’s beamlet is given by
ICEX = IBeamletnoσCEXld,
(6.6-1)
where ld is the effective collection length downstream of the accel grid from which ions flow back to
the grid and no is the average neutral density along this length. The charge exchange cross section,
σCEX, is well known and varies slowly with beam energy [50]. The average neutral density along the

path length ld is estimated from the thruster propellant flow rate utilization fraction, which is the
difference between the neutral atom flow rate and the beam ion current over the open area fraction
of the accel grid. The neutral density is usually assumed to remain constant in the accel grid hole
and decreases as the gas expands downstream of the grid surface. The neutral gas density is nor-
mally highest in holes near the edge of the grid and lower at the center where nearly all the gas has
been “burned up” through ionization in the discharge chamber. The effective path length, ld, is a
basic result of the ion optics calculations and is essentially the distance downstream at which the
beamlets have completely merged to form a beam-plasma with a uniform potential across the beam
diameter. An estimate of the effective path length is needed when setting up a grid erosion calcu-
lation to make certain that the computational region is long enough to include all the charge
exchange ions that can return to the grid.
Using Eq. 6.6-1 and the current ratio from Fig. 6-24, an estimate can be made of the effective path
length (ld) for the NSTAR thruster. If the measured accel grid current is all due to charge exchange
(i.e. no direct interception), then Eq. 6.6-1 can be rewritten as
ld =
Iaccel
IBeamσCEXno
(6.6-2)
Assuming the effective charge exchange path length is much longer than the gap between the
screen and accelerator grids, the average neutral gas density can be estimated from the grid
diameter, the flow of neutral gas out of the thruster, and the thruster beam current. The neutral
gas density downstream of the grids close to the thruster is then
no =
Γo

,
(6.6-3)
where υo is the neutral velocity, and Γo is the flux of unutilized propellant escaping from the dis-
charge chamber. Using the parameters for the NSTAR at TH15 from [29], the total neutral flow into
the thruster is 28 sccm. The thruster discharge chamber has a mass utilization efficiency of about
88%, so the neutral gas flow escaping the thruster is about 3.4 sccm, which corresponds to 1.5 × 1018
particles per second. Assuming the gas exits the thruster at about the thruster operating tempera-
ture of 250 C, the neutral velocity c 2is about 110 m/s. The average neutral density from Eq. 6.6-3 is
then about 2.3 × 1017 m−3 and neutral density varies over the grid by more than factor of two. Using

the data in Fig. 6-24 extrapolated to the beam current of 1.76 A in TH15, and a charge exchange
cross section of 5 × 10−19 m2, the average effective path length from Eq. 6.6-2 becomes

(6.6-4)
The path length is more than an order of magnitude larger than the grid gap, consistent with our
assumption. The very long path length compared with grid hole spacing means that the computa-
tional space in ion optics codes is very long (several centimeters), and so the computer codes must
allow for the axial zone sizes to increase downstream of the grids.
6.6.2
Barrel Erosion
As was illustrated in Fig. 6-20, charge exchange ions generated between the screen grid and the
upstream surface of the accel grid can impact the interior surface of the accel grid holes. These ions
sputter away grid material, increasing the barrel radius. While computer codes, such as CEX-2D [4],
are normally used to calculate the erosion rate, it is instructive to derive an analytical estimate. The
following calculation is based on published performance and erosion data for NASA’s NSTAR
thruster operating at its highest power TH15 level [29, 52].
Assume that any ions generated downstream of the discharge chamber are not focused through
the hole in the accelerator grid. For barrel erosion, the path length is taken as the sum of the grid
gap and the accelerator grid thickness, which for NSTAR is about 1 mm. The upstream gas density
is estimated by dividing the downstream density by the grid open area fraction, fa, and the Clausing
[54] factor ηc, which reduces the gas transmission due to the finite thickness of the accel grid. The
Clausing factor depends only on the aperture length to radius ratio. The neutral gas density is then
no =
Γo
υoπr2
grid

f aηc
(6.6-5)
The neutral gas density in the accelerator grid apertures is higher than the gas density downstream
of the accelerator grid, which was calculated using Eq. 6.6-2, because of the effects of the open area
fraction and the Clausing factor. For an open area fraction of 0.24 and a Clausing factor of 0.6, the
neutral density in the grid gap is about 9 × 1018 m−3.
The number of grid apertures is approximately the grid open area divided by the area per

given as

(6.6-8)
The published value of NSTAR beam flatness from Polk [30] is 0.47. Using Eqs. 6.6-6, 6.6-7 and
6.6-8, the maximum current per aperture is 2.5 × 10−4 A. Charge exchange ions that can hit the
260
6 Ion Thruster Accelerators

accel grid are generated in between the screen grid exit and the accel grid exit. The distance d
between the screen grid exit and the accel grid exit is about 1.12 mm [4]. The charge exchange
ion current to the central aperture barrel is then
ICEX = Imax
aperturenoσCEXd = 1 4x10 −6 A
(6.6-9)
The CEX-2D computer code simulations [4] show that charge exchange ions hit the accelerator grid
with about three-tenths of the beam potential. For NSTAR, the beam potential is 1100 V; thus, the
average charge exchange ion energy is about 330 V. Using the curve fit in the same reference for
sputtering yield Y, the aperture atom sputter rate is obtained:
nsputter = ICEX
e
Y ≈3 5 × 1012 # s
(6.6-10)
This atom sputtering rate can be used to find an initial wall erosion rate by first calculating the

where the density of molybdenum is ρMo = 1.03 × 104 and the mass of molybdenum is MMo = 95.94

Assuming the erosion rate is uniform throughout the barrel, the rate of increase of the aperture
radius is just the volumetric erosion rate divided by the barrel area
raperture =
V aperture
2π rawaccel
≈3 × 10 −11 m s ,
(6.6-13)
where the accel grid aperture radius ra is 0.582 mm and the accel grid thickness waccel is 0.5 mm. For
the 8200 h NSTAR wear test results described by Polk [30], this corresponds to an increase in diam-
eter of about 0.2 mm; roughly what was observed.
More accurate predictions of the accel grid barrel erosion rate are found using the 2D computer
simulations. The CEX-2D code [4] from JPL has been benchmarked against NSTAR grid erosion
observed in several wear tests [51–53], and used to predict the grid life for flight missions such as
BepiColombo [55]. Multidimension simulation codes such as this use the same basic technique as
shown here analytically to determine the amount of material removed by the charge exchange sput-
tering. The better predictions from the codes result from more accurate calculations of the neutral
density and ion current densities across the grid surfaces and through the grid apertures.
6.6.3
Pits and Groves Erosion
Using three-dimensional ion optics codes, it is possible to reproduce the details of the “pits and
groove” geometry of accelerator grid downstream surface erosion. The JPL CEX-3D code was devel-
oped [17] to solve for potentials and ion trajectories in a two-grid ion optics system, and was later
modified to include a third grid [56]. The computational domain, illustrated in Fig. 6-25, is a tri-
angular wedge extending from the axis of a hole-pair to the midpoint between two aperture pairs.
The wedge angle of 30 is chosen to give the smallest area that can be used to model the ion optics to
6.6 Ion Accelerator Grid Life

minimize computational time. Similar triangles will cover each aperture pair by a combination of
reflections and rotations. The computational domain extends from a few millimeters into the dis-
charge chamber through the grids to few centimeters downstream of the final grid.
In addition to tracking the beam-ion trajectories, the code calculates charge exchange ion pro-
duction rates and charge exchange trajectories in three dimensions. Erosion of the accel grid barrel
and downstream face is caused by these charge exchange ions. The location, kinetic energy, inci-
dence angle, and current of each particle is recorded and used to compute the rate at which the grid
material is removed. As shown above, charge exchange ions that strike the downstream surface of
the accelerator grid can come from several centimeters downstream of the grid. Therefore, the com-
putations domain is usually extended to 5–10 cm downstream of the final grid.
An example of the accel-grid downstream face erosion pattern on the NSTAR thruster predicted
by CEX3D is shown in Fig. 6-26. The triangular patches (the “pits”), where the grid webbing inter-
sects, were shown in the photograph of the NSTAR ELT grid at the end of the test [51] and are

predicted by the code in the plot on the left. In addition, the depth of the ring of erosion around the
aperture (“the groves”) is also seen in the plot on the right from the code predictions. The distri-
bution of wear between the pits regions and the groves depends on the operating parameters of the
ion accelerator, and CEX3D clearly shows the dependence on different ion thrusters such as NEXT
and T6 [55].
Accelerator grid pits and groove erosion can be almost eliminated by the use of a third decelerator
grid [43]. The XIPS© thruster [57] is an example of an ion thruster that uses a three-grid ion optics
system. As shown in Fig. 6-27, the third grid reduces from centimeters to millimeters the length of
the region where charge exchange ions are generated that can hit the accelerator grid. This causes a
dramatic reduction in the pits and grooves erosion between the two thrusters, shown in Fig. 6-28 as
calculated using CEX-3D.
Although the three-dimensional code CEX-3D is used to predict erosion of the accelerator grid
downstream surface, the simpler, two-dimensional, CEX-2D code is typically used for accelerator
grid aperture barrel erosion calculations because the apertures are cylindrical and the CEX2D
code can produce these results more quickly. CEX-2D and CEX-3D use the same algorithms
for the discharge chamber plasma and for beam ion trajectories. The codes have been bench-
marked with each other, and for round beamlets that can be handled by CEX-2D their results
are within a few percent.

6 Ion Thruster Accelerators

6.5
One of the first ion thrusters to fly in space was a cesium surface ionization thruster where
cesium ions are pulled from a hot surface by the acceleration electric field. Model the thruster
as a diode with cesium ions at 7.5 mA/cm2 coming from one surface and the other electrode is
the accel grid with 80% transparency and a grid gap “d” from the ion source.
a) Assuming 100% mass utilization efficiency, neglecting the angular divergence of the beam,
and using a 200 V negative bias on the accel grid, what is the voltage, current, thruster
diameter and gap size required to produce 5 mN of thrust at an Isp of 3000 s?
b) If the thruster has 95% mass utilization efficiency and a total angular divergence of the
beam of 10 , how does that change the results of part (a)?
c) If it takes 100 W of heater power to heating the cesium ion emitting surface to the required
surface temperature of about 1350 K, what is the total efficiency of the thruster. (use the
parameters from part b).

6 Ion Thruster Accelerators

Chapter 7
Conventional Hall Thrusters
7.1
Introduction
Hall thrusters are relatively simple-appearing devices consisting of a cylindrical channel with an
interior embedded anode, a magnetic circuit that generates primarily a radial magnetic field across
the channel, and a cathode that injects electrons into the near-thruster region external to the chan-
nel. However, Hall thrusters rely on much more complicated physics compared to ion thrusters
because of the E × B plasma discharge that accelerates ions and produces thrust. The details of
the channel structure and magnetic field shape determine the performance, efficiency and life
of the thruster [1–5]. The efficiency and specific impulse of flight-model Hall thrusters are
approaching that achievable in ion thrusters [6, 7], but the thrust to power ratio and the beam cur-
rent density are higher, and the total impulse can be comparable. Hall thrusters are simpler to build
than ion thrusters because of the lack of precision-aligned close-space grids, and they require fewer
power supplies and propellant flow controllers to operate.
Hall thrusters were originally developed in Russia in the 1960s [8] and first flown in the early
1970s on Russian communications satellites [9]. Two varieties of Hall thrusters emerged in Russia
during this period [4]: the Stationary Plasma Thruster (SPT) and the Thruster with Anode Layer
(TAL). The basic geometry of both these “conventional” Hall thrusters has not changed in the past
50 years. The performance and power level have been improved incrementally over the years, but
the life of both the SPT and TAL varieties in terms of hours of operation has remained less than
about 10,000 h (much shorter than ion thrusters) because of channel wall erosion from energetic
ion bombardment in the acceleration region. This relative short life has limited the use of Hall
thrusters in deep space science mission prime propulsion applications, but is sufficient for orbit
raising and station keeping applications in earth-orbiting satellites. This situation resulted in the
development of Hall thruster technology in the United States over the past 25 years primarily
for use in modern communications satellites. In this chapter, the physics and technology of these
“conventional” Hall thrusters will be described.
The design and performance of Hall thrusters was revolutionized in 2010 by a new technique
called “Magnetic Shielding” that protects the channel wall from ion bombardment, thereby elim-
inating channel erosion as the primary failure mode in these thrusters. This improvement was fur-
ther advanced by the observation that plasma-wall interactions that dominate the “conventional”
Hall thrusters was reduced sufficiently to allow replacement of the dielectric walls with metallic
conductors such as graphite. These Magnetically Shielded Hall thrusters will be described in
Chapter 8.

7.1.1
Discharge Channel with Dielectric Walls (SPT)
The terms Hall thruster, Hall-Effect Thruster (HET), Stationary Plasma Thruster (SPT), Dielectric
Wall Hall Thruster, and Magnetic-Layer Thruster are all names for essentially the same device that
is characterized by the use of a dielectric insulating wall in a relatively long plasma channel, as
illustrated in Fig. 7-1. The hollow cathode can be installed outside the discharge channel (as shown
in the figure), or on the centerline of the thruster. The discharge channel wall is typically manu-
factured from dielectric materials such as boron nitride (BN) or borosil (BNSiO2) in flight thrusters,
and also sometimes alumina (AL2O3) in laboratory thrusters. These dielectric materials have a low
sputtering yield and relatively low secondary electron emission coefficients under xenon ion bom-
bardment. In this thruster geometry, the electrically biased metallic anode is positioned at the base
of the channel where the majority of the propellant gas is injected into the thruster. The remainder
of the propellant gas used by the thruster (typically <10% of the total) is injected through the hollow
cathode. In the second version of this type of thruster, called Thrusters with Anode Layer (TAL), the
dielectric channel wall is replaced by a metallic conducting wall, as illustrated in Fig. 7-2. This
geometry considerably shortens the electric field region in the channel where the ion acceleration
occurs near the anode; hence the name “Thruster with Anode Layer” from the Russian literature
[1]. However, this configuration does not change the basic ion generation or acceleration method.
The channel wall, which is usually also part of the magnetic circuit, is biased negatively (usually
cathode potential) to repel electrons in the ionization region and reduce electron-power losses. The
defining differences between these two types of Hall thrusters have been described in the litera-
ture [4].
In the conventional Hall thruster with dielectric walls illustrated in Fig. 7-1, an axial electric field
is established between the anode at the base of an annular channel and the hollow-cathode plasma
produced outside the thruster channel. A transverse (radial) magnetic field prevents electrons from
this cathode plasma from streaming directly to the anode. Instead, the electrons spiral along the
magnetic field lines (as illustrated) and in the E × B azimuthal direction (into the page) around
the channel, and they diffuse by collisional processes and electrostatic fluctuations to the anode
and channel walls. The plasma discharge generated by the electrons in the crossed electric and

magnetic fields efficiently ionizes the propellant injected into the channel from the anode region.
Ions from this plasma bombard and, near the channel exit, sputter-erode the dielectric walls, which
ultimately determines the life of the thruster. Electrons from this plasma also bombard the dielec-
tric wall, depositing a significant amount of power in this region. The reduced axial electron mobil-
ity produced by the transverse magnetic field permits the applied discharge voltage to be distributed
along the channel axis in the quasi-neutral plasma, resulting in an axial electric field in the channel
that accelerates the ions to form the thrust beam. Therefore, Hall thrusters are typically regarded as
electrostatic devices [1] because the ions are accelerated by the applied electric field, even though a
magnetic field is critical to the process (see Section 2.2.2). However, since the acceleration occurs in
the plasma region near the channel exit, space charge is not an issue and the ion current density and
the thrust density can be considerably higher than that achievable in gridded ion thrusters. The
external hollow cathode plasma is not only the source of the electrons for the discharge, but it also
provides the electrons to neutralize the ion beam. The single hollow cathode in Hall thrusters serves
the same function as the two cathodes in DC-electron discharge ion thrusters that produce the
plasma and neutralize the beam.
7.1.2
Discharge Channel with Metallic Walls (TAL)
The TAL thruster with metallic walls, illustrated in Fig. 7-2, has the same functional features of the
dielectric-wall Hall thruster; namely the axial electric field is established between the anode in the
annular channel and the plasma potential outside the thruster channel. This field accelerates ions
from the ionization region near the anode out of the channel. The transverse (radial) magnetic field
again prevents electrons from streaming directly to the anode, and the electron motion is the same
as in the dielectric-wall Hall thruster. However, the channel walls at the exit plane have metallic
guard rings biased at cathode potential to reduce the electron loss along the field lines. These rings

represent the major erosion source in the thruster because of ion bombardment from the plasma,
and the guard ring material and design often determine the thruster life. The anode typically
extends close to the thruster exit and is often funnel-shaped and curved to constrain the neutral
gas and plasma to the center of the channel (away from the guard rings) and to not intercept
the magnetic field lines which would cause large electron losses. However, the anode is in close
proximity to the high electron-temperature region of the plasma, and electrons collected by the
anode can deposit a significant amount of power. The channel width in TAL thrusters is typically
twice the channel depth (including the anode shaping). The external hollow cathode plasma pro-
vides the electrons for the discharge and for neutralization of the ion beam, the same as for dielec-
tric-wall Hall thrusters.
The azimuthal drift of the electrons around the channel in the crossed electric and magnetic fields
in the cylindrical thruster geometry is reminiscent of the Hall Current in magnetron type devices,
which has caused many authors to call this generically a “closed-drift” thruster [1, 2, 4]. However,
King [10] correctly points out that the orientation of the fields in magnetrons (axial magnetic and
radial electric) provides a restoring force to the centrifugal force felt by the electrons as they rotate
about the axis, which produces the closed-drift electron motion in magnetrons. There is no corre-
sponding restoring force associated with the different orientation of the crossed fields (radial mag-
netic and axial electric required to produce axial thrust) in Hall thrusters. The closed-drift behavior
of the electron motion in Hall thrusters only occurs because of wall sheath electric fields and the
force associated with the magnetic gradient in the radial direction in the channel. In this case,
the electrons in the channel encounter an increasing magnetic field strength as they move toward
the wall, which acts as a magnetic mirror to counteract the radial centrifugal force.
The radial magnetic field gradient in the channel also forms an “ion lens” which tends to deflect
the ions away from the channel walls and focus the ions out of the channel into the beam. Fig. 7-3
shows an example of the magnetic field lines in the NASA-173Mv Hall thruster [11] developed at
NASA-GRC. The curvature of the field lines in the channel approaching the exit is found to signif-
icantly improve the efficiency, especially for higher voltage (high Isp) Hall thrusters [11, 12]. The
strength of the radial magnetic field in the center along the channel [13] is shown in Fig. 7-4. The
radial field peaks near the channel exit, and is designed to be essentially zero at or near the anode
surface.

Operating Principles and Scaling
The operating principles of both types of conventional Hall thrusters and some scaling rules for the
geometries can be obtained from a simplified picture of the thruster discharge. Consider a generic
Hall thruster channel shown schematically in cross section in Fig. 7-5. The propellant gas is injected
from the left through the anode region and is incident on the plasma generated in the channel. An
axial scale length L is defined over which the crossed-field discharge is magnetized and produces a
significant plasma density of width w, which is essentially the channel width. Ions exiting this
plasma over the cylindrically symmetric area Ae form the beam. The applied magnetic field is pri-
marily vertical in the plasma region in this depiction.

Crossed-field Structure and the Hall Current
The electrons entering the Hall thruster channel from the exterior cathode spiral around the radial
magnetic field lines with a Larmor radius derived in Chapter 3 and defined by Eq. 3.3-13. The elec-
tron Larmor radius must be less than the characteristic scale length L so that the electrons are mag-
netized and their mobility to the anode is reduced. If the electron velocity is characterized by their
thermal velocity, then the electron Larmor radius is

where TeV is the electron temperature in eV (electron volts) and L is the magnetized plasma depth
(the ionization region) in the channel. For example, the electron Larmor radius at a temperature of
25 eV and a typical radial magnetic field strength of 150 G is 0.13 cm, which is much smaller than
typical channel width and plasma length in Hall thrusters. The electrons must also be considered
magnetized, meaning that they make many orbits around a field line before a collision with a neu-
tral or ion occurs that results in cross-field diffusion. This is normally described by stating that the
square of electron Hall parameter must be large compared to unity:
Ω2
e = ω2

ν2 >> 1,
7 2-2
where ν is the total collision frequency. The effect of this criterion is clear in the expression for the
transverse electron mobility in Eq. 3.6-66 where a large value for the Hall parameter significantly
reduces the cross-field electron mobility.
In a similar manner, the ion Larmor radius must be much greater than the characteristic channel
length so that the ions can be accelerated out of the channel by the applied electric field:

where the ion energy is approximated as the beam energy. The ion Larmor radius, for example, in
the 150 G radial field and at 300 eV of energy is about 180 cm, which is much larger than the chan-
nel or plasma dimensions. These equations provide a general range for the transverse magnetic field
in the thruster channel. Even if the radial magnetic field strength doubles or ion energy is half of the
example given, the criteria in Eqs. 7.2-1 and 7.2-3 are still easily satisfied.
As mentioned above, the magnetic and electric field profiles are important in the thruster per-
formance and life, and the magnetic field configuration strongly impact the plasma flows in the
Hall thruster [14]. The radial magnetic field is typically a maximum near the thruster exit plane,
as shown in Fig. 7-4, and it is designed to fall near zero at the anode in dielectric-wall Hall thrusters
[15]. Electrons from the cathode experience joule heating in the region of maximum transverse
magnetic field, providing a higher localized electron temperature and ionization rate. The reduced

electron mobility and high electron temperature in the strong magnetic field region causes the axial
electric field to also be maximized near the exit plane, as illustrated in Fig. 7-6. Since the neutral gas
is injected from the anode region and the mass utilization is very high (nearly every neutral is
ionized before reaching the channel exit), it is common to describe an “ionization region” that
is located upstream of the electric field peak. Of course, the ions are accelerated directly by the elec-
tric field that peaks near the exit plane, which is sometimes called the “acceleration region”. The
characteristic scaling length L then spans these regions and is a significant fraction of the total
channel depth. The ionization and acceleration regions overlap, which leads to dispersion in the
ion velocity and some angular divergence in the resultant beam. This is in contrast to ion thrusters,
which have a distinct ionization region in the plasma chamber and a finite acceleration region in
the grids that produces nearly monoenergetic beams with low angular divergence determined by
the optics and curvature of the grids.
In the crossed electric and magnetic field region of the channel, the electrons move in the
azimuthal direction because of the E × B force with a velocity given by Eq. 3.3-16. The magnitude
of the azimuthal electron velocity was found in Chapter 3 to be
υE = E × B

The current in the azimuthal direction, called the Hall current, is then the integral of the electron

where w is the plasma width (shown in Fig. 7-5) that essentially fills the channel. The axial electric
field in the plasma channel is, approximately, the discharge voltage divided by the plasma thick-
ness, so the Hall current is
IH ≈nee w Vd
B
7 2-6
Equation 7.2-6 shows that the Hall current increases with the applied discharge voltage and with
the channel width provided that the magnetic field is unchanged. Hofer [12] showed that in Hall
thrusters optimized for high efficiency, the optimal magnetic field was proportional to the discharge
voltage. This implies that the Hall current is approximately constant for a given plasma density or
beam current in high efficiency Hall thrusters.

7.2 Operating Principles and Scaling
275

This expression for the thrust has the same form as Eq. 2.3-8 derived in Chapter 2, but the force is
coupled magnetically to the Hall thruster body instead of electrostatically to the ion
thruster grids.
7.2.2
Ionization Length and Scaling
It is clear from the description of the Hall thruster operation above that the electrons must be mag-
netized to reduce their axial mobility to the anode, but the ions cannot be significantly magnetized
so that the axial electric field can efficiently accelerate them to form the thruster beam. In addition,
a large majority of the ions must be generated in the channel to permit acceleration by the field in
that region and to produce high mass utilization efficiency [16]. This provides some simple scaling
rules to be established.
The neutral gas injected from the anode region will by ionized by entering the plasma discharge
in the crossed-field “ionization” region. Consider a neutral gas atom at a velocity υn incident on
plasma of a density ne, electron temperature Te, and thickness L. The density of the neutral gas,
nn, will decrease with time because of ionization:
dnn
dt
= −nnne σiυe ,
7 2-10
where <σiυe> is the ionization reaction rate coefficient for Maxwellian electrons found in Appendix
E. The flux of neutrals incident on the plasma is
Γn = nnυn,
7 2-11
and the neutral velocity is υn = dz/dt, where z is the axial length. Equation 7.2-10 then becomes
dΓn
Γn
= −ne σiυe
υn
dz
7 2-12
This equation has a solution of
Γn z = Γ 0 e −z λi,
7 2-13
where Γ(0) is the incident flux on the ionization region and the ionization mean free path λi is
given by
λi =
υn
ne σiυe
7 2-14
This expression for the ionization mean free path is different from the one given in Eq. 3.6-6 that
applies for the case of fast particles incident on essentially stationary particles. This is because the
neutral gas atoms are moving slowly as they traverse the plasma thickness, and the fast electrons
can move laterally to produce an ionization collision before the neutral leaves the region. Therefore,
the ionization mean free path depends on the velocity of the neutral, which determines the time it
spends in the plasma thickness before a collision. The mean free path also varies inversely with the
electron density because a higher number of electrons in the slab will increase the probability of one
of them encountering the neutral.
The percentage of the neutral flux exiting the plasma of length L that are ionized is
Γexit
Γincident
= 1 −e −L λi
7 2-15
276
7 Conventional Hall Thrusters

For example, to have 95% of the incident neutral flux on the plasma be ionized before it leaves the
plasma, Eq. 7.2-15 gives
L = −λi ln 1 −0 95 ≈
3υn
ne σiυe
,
7 2-16
or the plasma thickness must be at least three times the ionization mean free path. Since some of the
ions generated in the plasma hit the channel side walls and re-enter the plasma as neutrals instead
of exiting as beam ions, the plasma thickness should significantly exceed the ionization mean free
path to obtain high mass utilization efficiency. This leads to one of the Hall thruster scaling rules of
λi
L = constant << 1
7 2-17
In this example, this ratio should be less than 0.33.
The channel’s actual physical depth in dielectric-wall Hall thrusters is given by the sum of the
magnetized plasma thickness (L) and the geometric length required to demagnetize the plasma at
the anode. This is illustrated schematically in Fig. 7-6 where the channel depth is nearly twice the
magnetized plasma length. The axial magnetic field gradient has been found to be critical for
thruster performance [15]. A decreasing radial magnetic field strength going toward the anode,
as shown in Fig. 7-6, results in higher thruster efficiency [5, 15]. At the anode, the plasma is largely
unmagnetized and an anode sheath forms to maintain particle balance, similar to the DC plasma
generator case discussed in Chapter 5. The anode sheath polarity and magnitude depend on the
local magnetic field strength and direction, which affects the axial electron mobility, and on the
presence of any insulating layers on the anode that affects the particle balance [17–19]. Maintaining
the local plasma near the anode close to the anode potential is important in applying the maximum
amount of the discharge voltage across the plasma for the acceleration of ions. In addition, the mag-
netic field profile near the thruster exit strongly affects both the ability to achieve closed electron
drifts in the azimuthal direction [10] and focusing of the ions in the axial direction as they are accel-
erated by the electric field [11]. Optimal magnetic field design in the exit region reduces the ion
bombardment of the walls and improves the ion trajectories leaving the thruster [20].
Additional information on the thruster operation can be obtained by examining the ionization
criteria. Properly designed Hall thrusters tend to ionize essentially all the propellant gas incident on
the plasma from the anode, so that
nnne σiυe AeL ≈nnυnAe
7 2-18
Using Eq. 7.2-6 for the Hall current, Eq. 7.2-18 becomes
L =
υneVdw
IH σiυe B
7 2-19
The length of the ionization region naturally must increase with neutral velocity and can decrease
with the ionization reaction rate coefficient, as seen in Eq. 7.2-16. This is important to achieve high
mass utilization when propellants with a lower mass than xenon, such as krypton, are used to
increase the specific impulse (Isp) of the thruster [21, 22].
Studies of optimized Hall thrusters of different sizes [23–29] have resulted in some scaling laws.
Detailed comparisons of the scaling laws in the literature with experimental results have been per-
formed by Daren et al. [23]. Assuming that the thruster channel inner to outer diameter ratio and
the ionization mean free path to plasma length ratio are constants, they found

where R is the outside radius of the channel and r is the inside radius of the channel. These scaling
rules indicate that the optimum current density is essentially constant as the thruster size changes.
The current density in conventional Hall thrusters is typically in the range of 0.1–0.2 A/cm2. Thus,
at a given discharge voltage, the power density in a Hall thruster is also constant. Higher power
densities are achieved by increasing the voltage, which has implications on the life of the thruster
in these conventional unshielded designs.

Plasma Potential and Current Distributions
The electrical schematic for a Hall thruster is shown in Fig. 7-7. The power supplies are normally all

power supplies as an ion thruster, namely a heater supply to raise the emitter to thermionic emis-
sion temperatures, and a keeper supply for ignition and to ensure stable cathode operation at very
low currents. The discharge supply is connected between the cathode-common (typically also con-
nected to the thruster body or magnetic circuit) and the anode located in the bottom of the channel.
As in ion thrusters, the cathode heater is turned off once the discharge supply is turned on, and the
cathode runs in a self-heating mode. The keeper is also normally used only during start-up and is
turned off once the thruster is ignited. Also shown are the inner and outer magnetic field coils and
their associated power supplies. Hall thrusters have been built with the cathode positioned on-axis
(not shown), but this does not change the electrical schematic.
The potential distribution in a Hall thruster is also illustrated in Fig. 7-7 where zero volts is cath-
ode potential, which typically floats negative relative to the spacecraft or facility “common” poten-
tial. In the upstream region of the channel (on the left) where the transverse magnetic field is low,
the plasma is weakly magnetized and the electron mobility is high. The plasma potential is then
close to the anode potential. The plasma potential decreases toward the cathode potential near
the thruster exit plane as the magnetic field increases (shown in Fig. 7-6) and limits the electron
mobility. The difference between the cathode potential and the beam potential (on the right side of
the plot) is the coupling voltage Vc, which is the voltage required to extract current from the hollow
cathode. The beam voltage is then
Vb = Vd −Vc
7 2-21
It is common in laboratory experiments to sometimes ignore the difference in potential between the
beam and ground/common potential as small (typically 10–20 V) and write the beam voltage as
V b
Vd −Vcg,
7 2-22
where Vcg is the cathode to ground voltage.
The on-axis potential, shown schematically by the dashed line in Fig. 7-7, decreases from the ion-
ization and acceleration regions to the thrust-beam plasma potential. Ions are generated all along
this potential gradient, which causes a spread in the ion energy in the beam. Since the majority of
the ions are generated upstream of the exit plane (in the “ionization region”), the average velocity of
the ion beam can then be expressed as
υb =
2e Vb
M
,
7 2-23
where Vb represents, in this case, the average potential across which the singly charged ions are
accelerated. The actual spread in the beam energy can be significant [30, 31], and must be measured
by plasma diagnostics.
The beam from the Hall thruster is charge neutral (equal ion and electron currents). As in ion
thrusters, the thruster floats with respect to either spacecraft common in space, or vacuum chamber
common on the ground. The common potential normally floats between the cathode and the beam
potentials, and can be controlled on spacecraft by a resistor between the spacecraft common and the
cathode common. The actual beam energy cannot be measured directly across the power supplies
because the potential difference between the beam and ground or spacecraft common is unknown
and must be measured by probes or energy analyzers. The coupling voltage is typically the order of
twenty volts to operate the cathode discharge properly, which usually ranges from 5 to 10% of the
discharge voltage for Hall thrusters with moderate Isp.
7.2 Operating Principles and Scaling
279

In a Hall thruster, the measured discharge current is the net current flowing through the dis-
charge supply. The current flowing in the connection between the anode and the power supply
in Fig. 7-7 is the electron and ion current arriving to the anode:
Id = Iea −Iia
7 2-24
The ion current is typically small because of its higher mass, and so the discharge current is essen-
tially the electron current collected by the anode. Likewise, the current flowing in the cathode leg
(neglecting any keeper current), is
Id = Ie + Iic,
7 2-25
where Ie is the emitted current and Iic is the ion current flowing back to the cathode. As with the
anode, the ion current to the cathode is typically small, so the discharge current is essentially just
the cathode electron emission current. Therefore, the discharge current is approximately
Id ≈Ie ≈Iea
7 2-26
Figure 7-8 shows a simplified picture of the currents flowing through the plasma, where the ion
currents to the anode and cathode are neglected as small and the ion and electron currents to
the dielectric walls are equal and are not shown. Ions are produced in the plasma by ionization
events. The secondary electrons from the ionization events, Iei, go to the anode, along with the pri-
mary electrons from the cathode, Iec. Primary electrons either ionize neutrals or contribute energy
to the plasma electrons so that the energetic electron distribution can produce the ionization. Since
it is assumed that the discharge current is essentially the total electron current collected by the
anode (the ion current is small), the discharge current can be written as
Id = Iei + Iec,
7 2-27
The discharge current is also, essentially, the electron current emitted by the cathode:
Id = Ie = Iec + Ieb
7 2-28
Using the fact that one electron and one ion are made in each ionization event such that Iei = Iib,
Eq. 7.2-27 becomes
Id = Iib + Iec
7 2-29
This relationship describes the net current crossing
the exit plane, and so it is commonly stated in the
literature that the discharge current is the ion
beam current plus the backstreaming electron cur-
rent crossing the exit plane [11].
Depending on the plasma conditions, it is possi-
ble for some fraction of the secondary electrons
produced near the channel exit to diffuse into
the beam. Equation 7.2-28 is still valid in this case-
because for every secondary electron that diffuses
into the beam, another electron from the cathode
plasma must cross the exit plane in the opposite
direction to maintain the net discharge current.
The discharge current is still the net ion beam cur-
rent plus the backstreaming electron current

across the exit plane. Finally, the ion beam current is equal to the current of electrons entering
the beam:
Iib = Ieb
7 2-30
Since there is no current return path for the beam ions and electrons because the thruster floats
relative to the spacecraft or the grounded vacuum system, the particles in Eq. 7.2-30 do not directly
contribute to the discharge current measured in the discharge power supply.
7.3
Performance Models
The efficiency of a generic electric thruster was derived in Chapter 2. Since the beam current and
ion energy in Hall thrusters are not directly measured as in ion thrusters, it is useful to develop an
alternative expression for the efficiency that incorporates characteristics of Hall thruster discharges.
Total efficiency is always defined as the jet power, which is one-half the thrust T times the exhaust
velocity υex, divided by the total input power Pin:
ηT = T υex

7 3-1
For any electric thruster, the exhaust velocity is given by Eq. 2.3-6, the Isp by Eq. 2.4-1, and the

Thruster Efficiency Definitions
The efficiency of a Hall thruster can be decomposed into a product of terms accounting for the con-
version of the electrical power and propellant flow into thrust [32]. The propellant flow in Hall
thrusters is split between the anode inside the discharge channel and the hollow cathode:
mp = ma + mc,
7 3-4
where ma is the anode flow rate and mc is the cathode flow rate. Since the cathode gas flow is
injected exterior to the discharge channel ionization region and is, thereby, largely lost, the “cath-
ode efficiency” is defined as
ηc = ma

The total power into the thruster is

where Pd is the discharge power, Pk is the cathode keeper power (normally equal to zero during
operation), and Pmag is the power used to generate the magnetic field. The electrical utilization effi-
ciency for the other power used in the Hall thruster is defined as
ηo = Pd

By placing the Hall thruster on a thrust stand to directly measure the thrust, knowing the flow rates
and flow-split between anode and cathode, and knowing the total power into the discharge, keeper
and magnet, it is then possible to accurately calculate the total efficiency.
While Eq. 7.3-8 provides a useful expression for evaluating the efficiency, it is worthwhile to fur-
ther expand this equation to examine other terms that affect the efficiency. Thrust is given from
Eq. 2.3-18:

Equation 7.3-12 shows that the Hall thruster efficiency is proportional to the ion mass and the dis-

the anode mass flow which dominates the mass utilization efficiency. This equation can be further
simplified by realizing that

This expression contains the usual gamma-squared term associated with beam divergence and mul-
tiply charged ion content, and also the mass utilization and electrical utilization efficiencies. How-
ever, this expression also includes the efficiencies associated with generating beam ions and
imparting the discharge voltage to the beam voltage. This shows directly that Hall thruster designs
that maximize beam current production and beam energy, and minimize the cathode flow, produce
the maximum efficiency provided that the beam divergence and double ion content are not
adversely affected. Expressions like Eq. 7-3-15 appear in the Hall thruster literature [5, 7], because
they are useful in illustrating how the efficiency depends on the degree that the thruster converts
power supply inputs (such as discharge current and voltage) into the beam current and beam volt-
age that impart thrust. Understanding each efficiency term is critical to fully optimize the Hall
thruster performance.
The efficiency of a Hall thruster is sometimes expressed in terms of the anode efficiency:

which describes the basic thruster performance without considering the effects of the cathode flow
or power used to generate the magnetic field. This is usually done to separate out the cathode and
magnet losses so that trends in the plasma production and acceleration mechanisms can be dis-
cerned. The anode efficiency should not be confused with the total efficiency of the thruster given
by Eq. 7.3-3.
It is useful to show an example of the relative magnitude of the efficiency terms derived above.
Figure 7-9 shows the anode efficiency that was defined in Eq. 7.3-16 and the other efficiency terms
discussed above for the laboratory-model NASA-173Mv2 Hall thruster operating at 10 mg/s versus
the discharge voltage. In this figure, the charge utilization efficiency is the net efficiency decrease
because of multiply charged ions [12], the voltage utilization efficiency (ηV) is the conversion of
voltage into axially directed ion velocity, the current utilization efficiency (ηb) is the fraction of
ion current contained in the discharge current, and mass utilization efficiency (ηm) is the conver-
sion of neutral mass flux into ion mass flux. The anode efficiency increases with discharge voltage,
largely because the voltage efficiency and current efficiency increase with voltage. The current

utilization is always lower than the other efficiency terms, suggesting that the ultimate efficiency of
Hall thrusters is dominated by the electron dynamics involved in producing the plasma and neu-
tralizing the beam. This emphasizes the importance [11, 12] of optimizing the magnetic field design
to maximize the thruster efficiency.
The value of γ in Eq. 7.3-15 that is typically found for Hall thrusters can be evaluated using
Eq. 2.3-11 and the data in the literature. For example, a 10% double ion content gives a thruster
correction factor in Eq. 2.3-17 of α = 0.973. The thrust loss due to the beam angular divergence
of Hall thrusters is given by Eq. 2.3-12 (FT = cosθ). For both SPT-100 Hall thrusters [6] and
TAL thrusters [33], a half angle divergence θ equal to about 20 is observed, producing FT = 0.94.
The total correction factor is then γ = αFT = 0.915 for typical Hall thruster conditions. Values for γ of
about 0.9 have been reported.
The equivalent discharge loss for a Hall thruster can also be calculated [5, 6] to provide informa-
tion on how the thruster design impacts the cost of producing the beam ions. The average energy
cost for producing a beam ion is the discharge power divided by the number of beam ions minus the
beam power per beam ion:
εb = IdVd

−Vb = Pd 1 −ηbηυ

7 3-17
where Eqs. 7.3-10 and 7.3-11 were used. Equation 7.3-17 has the usual units for discharge loss of
watts per beam-amp or electron-volts per ion. As expected, maximizing the current and voltage
efficiencies minimizes the discharge loss. As an example of discharge loss in a Hall thruster, con-
sider the SPT-100 thruster operating at the nominal 1.35 kW discharge power and 300 V. The dis-
charge current is then 1350/300 = 4.5 A. The thruster is reported [3, 5, 6] to have values of ηb ≈0.7
and ηυ = 0.95. The cost of producing beam ions is then
εb = Pd 1 −ηbηυ

This is on the same order as the discharge loss for DC-discharge ion thrusters.
7.3.2
Multiply Charged Ion Correction
In Hall thrusters operating at higher power levels (high mass flow rate and high discharge voltages
>300 V), a significant number of multiply charged ions can be generated, and their effect on the
performance may be noticeable. Following the analysis by Hofer [13], the performance model from
the previous section can be modified to address the case of partially-ionized thruster plasmas with
an arbitrary number of ion species.

Dominant Power Loss Mechanisms
In preparation for examining the terms that drive the efficiency of Hall thrusters, it is helpful to
examine the dominant power loss mechanisms in the thruster. Globally, the power into the thruster
comes from the discharge power supply. The power out of the thruster, which is equal to the input
power, is given to first order by
Pd = Pb + Pw + Pa + PR + Pion,
7 3-27
where Pb is the beam power given IbVb, Pw is the power to the channel walls due of ion and electron
loss, Pa is the power to the anode due of electron collection, PR is the radiative power loss from the
plasma, and Pion is the power to produce the ions that hit the walls and become the beam. The
additional loss terms, such as the power that electrons take into the beam, the ion power to the
anode, etc., are relatively small and can usually be neglected.
In Hall thrusters with dielectric walls, the power loss because of ion and electron currents flowing
along the radial magnetic field through the sheath to the channel walls (Pw) represents the most
significant power loss. The current deposition and power lost to the walls can be estimated from the
sheath potentials and electric fields in the plasma edge. Since the wall is insulating, the net ion and
electron currents to the surface must be equal. However, ion and electron bombardment of
7.3 Performance Models
285

common insulator materials, such as boron nitride, at the energies characteristic of Hall thrusters
produces a significant number of secondary electrons, which reduces the sheath potential at the
wall and increases the power loading.
The requirement of local net current equal to zero and particle balance for the three species gives
Iiw = Iew −γIew = Iew 1 −γ ,
7 3-28
where γ is the secondary electron yield from electron bombardment. Using Eq. 3.7-53 for the Bohm
current of ions to the wall, Eq. 3.7-54 for the electron current to the wall, and neglecting the sec-
ondary electron velocity, Eq. 7.3-28 can be solved for the sheath potential ϕs including the effect of
secondary electron emission by the wall up to a secondary yield of one:
ϕs = −kTe
e
ln
1 −γ
2M

7 3-29
This expression is slightly different than that found in the literature [34, 35] because we have
approximated e−1/2 = 0.61 ≈0.5 for the coefficient in the expression for the Bohm current. Never-
theless, as the secondary electron yield increases from zero, the sheath potential decreases from the
classic floating potential described in Chapter 3 toward the plasma potential. If the secondary elec-
tron yield exceeds one, this simple model breaks down and the potentials will change to obtain
floating walls and zero net current.
Secondary electron yields reported in the literature [34, 36, 37] for several materials used for the
walls of Hall thrusters are shown in Fig. 7-10. In this figure, the measurements were made using a
monoenergetic electron gun. Generalizing this data for incident Maxwellian electron
temperatures is accomplished by integrating the yield over the Maxwellian electron energy dis-
tribution function, which results in multiplying the secondary emission scaling by the Gamma

where the electron temperature is in electron volts and Γ(x) is the Gamma Function and the coeffi-
cients a and b are found from fits to the data in Fig. 7-10. Values of the coefficients in Eq. 7.3-30 can
be found in Table 7-1 for these materials, and the actual secondary electron yield for the Hall
thruster walls is plotted versus plasma electron temperature in Fig. 7-11. It should be noted that
because of reflection at the wall, the effective secondary electron yield does not go to zero for zero
electron energy. This effect is accommodated by linear fits to the data that result in finite yield at
low electron energy. Figure 7-12 shows the data for BN and BNSiO2 with the two different fitting
choices. In the evaluation of the sheath potential in the presence of the secondary electron emission
below, the choice of whether to use a linear or power fit does not make a significant difference in the
ionization and acceleration regions for electron temperatures above about 10 eV.
Measurements of the electron temperature in the channel of Hall thrusters by a number of authors
[38–40] show electron temperatures in the channel well in excess of 20 eV. Equation 7.3-29 predicts
that the sheath potential will go to zero and reverse from negative going (electron repelling) to

positive-going (electron attracting) as the secondary electron yield approaches unity for some of the
materials. The value at which this occurs for each of the materials shown in Table 7-1 is indicated in
Fig. 7-11. For boron nitride and alumina walls this occurs at electron temperatures below 20 eV, and
for BN-SiO2 walls it occurs at electron temperatures on the order of 30 eV. In addition, some of the
secondary electrons can pass completely through the plasma to strike the opposite wall of the chan-
nel, depending on the collision mean free path. The possibility of the sheath potential reversing to
electron-attracting was used to predict very high electron power losses to the walls in some early
analysis of Hall thrusters at high electron temperatures [34, 35] because the incident electron flux
can then equal or exceed the random electron flux along the magnetic field lines in the plasma.
In reality, the sheath potential for a floating boundary in conventional Hall thrusters can never go
more positive than the local plasma potential [41, 42] for two reasons. First, the secondary electrons
are ejected from the wall with very low energy (typically 1–2 eV). Any positive going sheath (where
the plasma is negative by one or two volts relative to the wall) will repel the secondary electrons and
return them to the wall. This clamps the sheath potential to within a few volts positive with respect
to the plasma. Second, the secondary electron emission is space charge limited in the sheath. This
effect was analyzed by Hobbs and Wesson [43], who showed that space charge limits the secondary
electron current from the wall independent of the secondary electron yield. The local electron space
charge in the sheath clamps the sheath voltage to a maximum value that is always negative relative
to the plasma.
The effects of space charge on the sheath potential at the wall can be analyzed [43] by solving

For the case of no secondary electron emission (γ going to zero), the Bohm criteria solution of
ε ≥kTe/2e is recovered. Owing to the small electron to ion mass ratio for xenon, the right-hand term
is always small and the ion velocity at the sheath edge for the case of finite secondary electron emis-
sion will be near the Bohm velocity. Hobbs and Wesson evaluated this minimum ion energy at the
sheath edge for the case of space charge limited emission of electrons at the wall (dϕo/dx|x=0 = 0 in
Eq. 7.3-37, and they found

Equation 7.3-39 indicates that the Bohm sheath criterion will still approximately apply (within
about 16%) in the presence of secondary electron emission.
The value of the sheath potential for the space charge limited case can be found by setting the
electric field at the wall equal to zero in Eq. 7.3-37 and evaluating the potential using Eq. 7.3-38 and

which for xenon is 0.983.
This analysis shows that the sheath potential for a xenon plasma decreases from −5.97Te for walls
where the secondary electron yield can be neglected, to −1.02Te for the case of space charge limited
secondary electron emission that will occur at high plasma electron temperatures. The value of the
sheath potential below the space charge limit can be found exactly by evaluating the three equa-
tions Eqs. 7.3-37, 7.3-38 and 7.3-40 for the three unknowns (ϕ, γ and ε).
However, the value of the sheath potential relative to the plasma edge in the presence of the sec-
ondary electron emission can be estimated by evaluating Eq. 7.3-28 while accounting for each of
three species [42]. Quasi-neutrality for the three species in the plasma edge dictates that ni = ne + ns,
where ns is the density of the secondary electrons, and the flux of secondary electrons is the sec-
ondary electron yield times the flux of plasma electrons. Equating the ion flux to the net electron

up to the space charge limited potential of ϕo = −1.02TeV and provides good agreement with the
results for xenon described above for neυB/niυi ≈0.5. The sheath potential predicted by Eq. 7.3-44 is
plotted in Fig. 7-13 for two wall materials. In the limit of no secondary electron emission (γ = 0), the
classic value for the sheath floating potential is obtained from Eq. 3.7-53. Once the electron tem-
perature is sufficiently high to produce a yield approaching and even exceeding one, then the space
charge limited case of ϕo = −1.02TeV is obtained. In between, the sheath potential depends on the
290

electron temperature and material of the wall. Without the space charge limited sheath regime pre-
dicted by Hobbs and Wesson, the potential would have continued along the thin dashed lines for
the two cases and incorrectly resulted in very low sheath potentials and high-power loadings at
the wall.

sheath edge, and is roughly half the average plasma density in the center of the channel due to the

For the case of space charge limited secondary electron emission, the sheath potential ϕs =

7.3-45 predicts the maximum heat loading to the wall in the presence of a Maxwellian electron dis-
tribution and secondary electron emission from the wall, which is the dominant power loss mech-
anism in dielectric-wall Hall thrusters. If the electron distribution function is non-Maxwellian, the
heat load to the wall can differ from that predicted by Eq. 7.3-45.
In the case of TAL thrusters, the channel wall is metallic and biased to cathode potential.
This eliminates the zero-net current condition found on the insulating walls of dielectric-channel
Hall thrusters and used to determine the local heat flux in Eq. 7.3-45. The electron flux to the

cathode-biased TAL channel wall is negligible, and the secondary yield for metals is much lower
than for insulators, so the secondary electron emission by the wall in TAL thrusters has little effect
on the thruster operation. In addition, the plasma tends to be localized near the channel center by
the anode design and gas feed geometry. The plasma then tends to be in poor contact with the guard
rings at the wall that also have a small exposed area to the plasma, resulting in low radial ion cur-
rents to the wall. This is evidenced by the erosion pattern typically observed on TAL guard rings
[33], which tends to be on the downstream face from particles outside the thruster instead of on the
inside diameter from the channel plasma. While the ion and electron currents and power deposi-
tion to the inside diameter of the metallic guard ring are likely smaller than in the dielectric-wall
thruster case (where the power loss due to the electrons is dominant), the erosion on the face of the
guard ring indicates energetic ion bombardment is occurring. This effect is significant in determin-
ing the life of the TAL.
However, TAL thrusters are characterized by having the anode in close contact with the magne-
tized plasma near the channel exit, in contrast to the dielectric-wall Hall thrusters. The magnetized
plasma has a high electron temperature, which causes a significant amount of power to be depos-
ited from the discharge current on the anode. It is possible to evaluate this power loss mechanism
based on the current and sheath potential at the anode.
As described above, the discharge current is essentially equal to the electron current collected at
the anode. For the TAL thruster to transfer a large fraction of the discharge voltage to the ions, the
potential of the plasma near the anode must be close to the anode potential. Assuming the local
plasma potential is then equal to or slightly positive relative to the anode, the electron current
to the anode, Ia, deposits 2TeV in energy from the plasma (see Appendix C). The power deposited
on the anode, Pa, is then given by
Pa = 2TeVIa ≈2TeVId,
7 3-47
where the electron temperature is at the anode and Eq. 7.2-26 has been used. If the plasma potential
is negative relative to the anode, the thruster efficiency will suffer because of the loss of discharge
voltage available to the ions, and the anode heating will increase because of the positive going
sheath potential accelerating electrons into the anode. Equation 7.3-47 then represents a reason-
able, but not worse case, heat flux to the anode.
This power loss to the anode can be related to the beam current using the fraction of the discharge
current that produces beam current, which is defined as
ηb = Ib
Id
7 3-48
Therefore, the power to the anode is
Pa = 2TeV
Ib
ηb
7 3-49
In well-designed Hall thrusters, ηb ranges typically from 0.6 to 0.8. Therefore, the power loss to the
anode is 3–4 times the product of the electron temperature in the near-anode region and the beam
current. This is the most significant power loss mechanism in TAL thrusters.
7.3.4
Electron Temperature
The electron temperature in the channel must be known to evaluate the power loss mechanisms
described above. The peak electron temperature in the plasma channel can be found using the
292
7 Conventional Hall Thrusters

power balance described by Eq. 7.3-27. This method provides reasonable estimates because the
power loss in the thruster will be shown to be a strong function of the electron temperature. Even
though the plasma density and electron temperature peak in different locations along the channel
associated with the different ionization and acceleration regions, the strong axial electron temper-
ature profile in Hall thrusters causes the majority of the power loss to occur in the region of the
highest electron temperature. This occurs near the channel exit where the magnetic field across
the channel is the strongest. Evaluating the plasma parameters and loss terms in this region, which
is bounded by the channel width and magnetic axial field extent in the channel, establishes the
electron temperature that is required to satisfy the power balance in the plasma for a given thruster
current and voltage.
The individual terms in Eq. 7.3-27 will now be evaluated. The input power to the thruster is
the discharge current times the discharge voltage (Pd = IdVd). The power in the beam, using
Eq. 7.3-48, is
Pb = ηbηυIdVd = ηυIbVd,
7 3-50
where the current utilization and voltage utilization efficiencies have to be known or evaluated by
some means. The difference between the beam power and the discharge power is the power remain-
ing in the plasma channel to produce the plasma and offset the losses:
Pp = 1 −ηbηυ IdVd = IecVd,
7 3-51
where Pp is the power into the plasma. The plasma is produced and heated essentially by the col-
lisional transport of the electrons flowing from the cathode plasma in the near-plume region to the
anode inside the thruster. The power into channel walls, from Eq. 7.3-45, can be written as

where A is the total area of the inner and outer channel walls in contact with the high temperature
plasma region, ne is the plasma density in the channel center, and the sheath potential ϕs is given by
Eq. 7.3-44. Equation 7.3-52 shows the wall power varies linearly with the density, but with the elec-
tron temperature to the 3/2 power. This is why the dominant power loss to the wall occurs in the
region of the highest electron temperature.
The power into the anode, from Eq. 7.3-47, can be written as
Pa = 2IdTeV anode
7 3-53
where the electron temperature in this case is evaluated near the anode. The power radiated is
PR = none σ∗υe V,
7 3-54
where the excitation reaction rate coefficient σ∗υe is given in Appendix E as a function of the elec-
tron temperature, and V is the volume of the high temperature plasma region in the channel which
can be taken to be the channel cross-sectional area times the axial thickness L. Equations 7.3-52 and
7.3-54 require knowledge of the plasma density in the high temperature region in the channel. This
can be found to first order from the beam current

where Ac is the area of the channel exit. Finally, the power to produce the ions in the thruster is the
sum of the beam current and the ion current to the walls times the ionization potential:
Pion = Ib + Iiw U + = ηbId + Iew 1 −γ
U + ,
7 3-56
where Iiw is given by Eq. 7.3-28 and Iew is given by the left-hand side of Eq. 7.3-52 divided by 2Te
(because the electron energy hitting the wall is already included in this equation).
The peak electron temperature is found by equating the input power to the plasma in Eq. 7.3-51
with the sum of the various loss terms described above, and then iterating to find a solution. For
example, the SPT-100 Hall thruster has a channel outside diameter of 10 cm, a channel inside diam-
eter of 7 cm, and runs nominally at a discharge of 300 V at 4.5 A with a current utilization efficiency
of 0.7 and a voltage utilization efficiency of 0.95 [6]. From Eq. 7.3-55, the plasma density at the
thruster exit is about 1.6 × 1017 m−3. The power into the plasma, from Eq. 7.3-51 is about 433 W.
Taking the electron temperature at the anode to be 5 eV and the hot-plasma thickness L to be about
1 cm, the power balance equation is satisfied if the electron temperature in the channel plasma is
about 25 eV.
It is a common rule-of-thumb in conventional Hall thrusters to find that the electron temperature
is about one-tenth the beam voltage [39]. The result in the example above of TeV ≈0.08Vd is con-
sistent with that observation. It is also important to note that nearly 70% of the power deposited into
the plasma goes to the dielectric-channel walls in the form of electron heating, and that the radi-
ation losses predicted by Eq. 7.3-54 are negligible for this case because the electron temperature is so
high. Finally, the ion current to the wall for this example from the solution to Eq. 7.3-28 is 0.52 A,
which is about 12% of the discharge current and 8% of the beam current in this thruster. This
amount agrees well with the 10% of the ion current going to the wall calculated by Baranov
[44] in analyzing Hall thruster channel wear.
7.3.5
Efficiency of Hall Thrusters with Dielectric Walls
The efficiency of a conventional Hall thruster with a dielectric-wall can be estimated by evaluating
the terms in the thruster efficiency given by Eq. 2.5-7, which requires evaluating the total power-
loss terms in Eq. 7.3-27 to obtain a value for the effective electrical efficiency. This also illustrates
the dominant loss mechanisms in the thruster.
The first term in Eq. 7.3-27, the beam power due to the accelerated ions, Pb, is just IbVb, where the
effective beam voltage will be used. The power loss to the dielectric-wall will be estimated for the
SPT-100 Hall thruster [3, 5, 6] using the analysis of Hobbs and Wesson [43] described in
Section 7.3.3. The power to the wall was given by Eq. 7.3-46:
Pw = Iiw
2M

7 3-57
where Iiw is the ion flux to the wall. Following Hobbs and Wesson, the modification to the Bohm
criterion is small and ε ≈TeV/2 from the Bohm criterion. From Eq. 7.3-44, the sheath potential for
xenon and BNSiO2 walls in the SPT-100 thruster, assuming an average electron temperature along
the channel wall of 25 eV, is about −54 V. Inserting these values into Eq. 7.3-57 gives
Pw = 45 8IiwTeV + 2 65IiwTeV = 48 5IiwTeV
7 3-58
The first term on the right-hand side is again the electron power loss to the wall (written in terms of
the ion current to the dielectric surface), and the second term is the ion power loss. The power loss
294
7 Conventional Hall Thrusters

to the channel wall because of the electron loss term is an order of magnitude larger than the power
loss due to ions.
It is convenient in evaluating the efficiency of the thruster to relate the ion current to the wall in
Eq. 7.3-58 to the beam current. In the plasma, there is a electric field toward the wall because of the
presheath of approximately TeV/2r = TeV/w. There is also the axial electric field of Vb/L producing
the beam energy. It is common in Hall thrusters to find that the electron temperature is about one-
tenth the beam voltage [39], and the channel width is usually approximately L [5, 23]. Therefore,
the axial electric field is on the order of 10 times the radial electric field. On average, then, the ion
current to the channel walls will be about 10% of the beam current. This very simple argument
agrees with the SPT-100 results given in the previous section and the results of Baranov [44].
Using Eq. 7.3-58 with the above estimates for the ion current and electron temperature, the power
loss to the insulator walls is
Pw = 48 5IiwTeV = 48 5 0 1Ib
0 1Vb = 0 49IbVb
7 3-59
The power loss to the anode is due to the plasma electrons overcoming the sheath potential at the
anode surface. From Eq. 7.2-24, the anode electron current is
Iea = Id + Iia
7 3-60
Neglecting the ion current to the anode as small (because of the mass ratio), and realizing that each
electron deposits 2kTe/e to the anode for positive plasma potentials (from Appendix C), the power
to the anode is
Pa = 2TeVId
7 3-61
The electron temperature near the anode is very low, typically less than 5 eV [38–40]. Using the
thruster current utilization efficiency and assuming ηb = 0.7 and TeV = 0.01Vb near the anode, this
can be written as
Pa = 2ηbIb 0 01V b = 0 014IbVb
7 3-62
The power required to produce the ions is given by Eq. 7.3-56. This can be written as
Pion = Ib + Iiw U + = 1 + ηb IdU +
7 3-63
Taking the beam utilization efficiency as 0.7 and estimating that the ionization potential is roughly
5% of the beam voltage, the power required to produce the ions is approximately Pion = 0.09IdVb.
The radiation power and other power loss mechanisms are small and will be neglected in this sim-
ple example.
The total discharge power into the thruster is then
Pd = IbVb + 0 49 IbVb + 0 014 IbVb + 0 09 IbVb = 1 59 IbVb
7 3-64
The electrical efficiency of the dielectric-wall thruster is then
ηe = IbVb
1 59 IbVb = 0 63
7 3-65
The total thruster efficiency, assuming the same beam divergence and double ion content as eval-
uated above and a mass utilization efficiency of 95% reported for SPT thrusters [5], is
ηT = 0 915 2 0 63
0 95 = 0 5
7 3-66
The SPT-100 thruster is reported to run at about 50% efficiency [5, 6]. Since the power loss is domi-
nated by the electron wall losses, this analysis illustrates how critical the wall material selection is to
7.3 Performance Models
295

minimize the secondary electron yield and maintain a sufficient wall sheath potential for good effi-
ciency. For example, if the wall had been made of alumina and the electron temperature is about 20
V, the sheath potential would be −1.02TeV in the space charge limited regime. The wall power from
Eq. 7.3-57 would then be about three times higher than in the BNSiO2 case:
Pw = 142IiwTeV = 1 4IbVb
7 3-67
The electrical efficiency of the thruster, assuming the same anode loading and energy loss to ion-
ization, would be ηe ≈0.40 and the total efficiency
ηT = 0 915 2 0 40
0 95 ≈0 32
7 3-68
Recent parametric experiments in which different wall materials were used in the SPT-100 [36]
showed that changing from BNSiO2 to alumina reduced the efficiency to the order of 30%, consist-
ent with the increased secondary electron yield of the different wall material.
The agreement of this simple analysis with the experimentally measured efficiencies is somewhat
fortuitous because the predictions are very sensitive to the secondary electron yield of the wall
material and the actual sheath potential. Small errors in the yield data, changes in the wall material
properties during thruster operation, and inaccuracies in the empirical values for the electron tem-
perature and ion flux with respect to the beam parameters, will significantly affect the calculated
results. Other effects may also be significant in determining the thruster efficiency. The analysis of
the sheath potential assumed a Maxwellian electron distribution function. It was recognized several
years ago [41, 45, 46] that the electron distribution may not be Maxwellian. Detailed kinetic mod-
eling of the Hall thruster channel plasma indicates [47] that the electron velocity distribution is
depleted of the high-energy tail electrons that rapidly leave the plasma along the magnetic field
lines and impact the wall. This is especially true near the space charge limit where the sheath volt-
age is small and a large fraction of the electron tail can be lost. The collision frequencies and ther-
malization rates in the plasma may be insufficient to re-populate the Maxwellian tail. This will
result in effectively a lower electron temperature in the direction parallel to the magnetic field
toward the walls [48], which can increase the magnitude of the sheath potential and reduce the
electron heat loss to the wall. In addition, re-collection of the secondary electrons at the opposite
wall [49, 50], because of incomplete thermalization of the emitted secondary electrons in the
plasma, modifies the space charge limits and sheath potential, which also can change the electron
heat flux to the wall.
These effects are difficult to model accurately because of the presence of several different electron
populations, several collision/thermalization processes, the effect of magnetization on the elec-
trons, and the presence of plasma instabilities. Understanding what determines the electron tem-
perature and velocity distribution as a function of the discharge voltage and current, and
uncovering the effects that determine the wall power flux and finding techniques to minimize
them, are continuing areas of research at this time.
7.3.6
Efficiency of TAL Thrusters with Metallic Walls
As with the 1.35 kW SPT-100 Hall thruster example above, an estimate will be made of the power
loss terms in Eq. 7.3-27 to obtain an electrical efficiency for the 1.4 kW D-55 TAL thruster [33].
Equation 2.5-7 will then be used to obtain an estimate for the thruster efficiency. The beam power
Pb is, again, just IbVb. As stated in the previous section, the wall losses (Pw) are essentially negligible
in TAL thrusters and the power to the anode is given by Eq. 7.3-49
296
7 Conventional Hall Thrusters

Pa = 2TeV
Ib
ηb
= 0 29IbVb
7 3-69
In Eq. 7.3-69, it is again assumed ηb = 0.7 and TeV = 0.1Vb, although these values may be somewhat
different in TAL thrusters. The power required to produce the ions is again approximately
0.09IbVb.
The total discharge power, Eq. 7.3-27, then becomes
Pd = IbVb + 0 29 IbVb + 0 09 IbVb = 1 4 IbVb
7 3-70
Neglecting the power in the cathode keeper (if any) and the magnet as small compared to the beam
power, the electrical utilization efficiency from Eq. 2.5-1 is then
ηe =
Pd
1 4Pd
= 0 72
7 3-71
The total thruster efficiency, assuming a 10% double ion content, a 20
angular divergence
[33, 51], and a 90% mass utilization efficiency reported for TAL thrusters [33, 51, 52], is then from
Eq. 2.4-7:
ηT = 0 915 2 0 72
0 9 = 0 54
7 3-72
This result on the same order as that reported in the literature [33, 51, 52] for this power level TAL
and is essentially the same as the SPT-100 efficiency in this simple example if the wall losses had
been included. However, the power loss to the anode is seen as the dominant energy loss mechan-
ism in the TAL efficiency. This is the main issue with TAL thrusters in that the anode heating is
usually significant.
7.3.7
Comparison of Conventional Hall Thrusters with Dielectric and Metallic Walls
It is interesting to make a few direct comparisons of dielectric-wall Hall thrusters with metallic-wall
TAL thrusters. Similar discussions have appeared in the literature [1, 4, 35], often with conflicting
opinions. The basic plasma physics in the channel described above applies to both the dielectric-
wall Hall thruster and the TAL. The maximum electron temperature occurs in both thrusters near
the channel exit in the region of strongest magnetic field where the Hall current is a maximum. The
different interaction of the thruster walls with this plasma determines many of the characteristics of
the thruster, including life. Conventional dielectric-wall thrusters have a significant amount of
their input power deposited as loss on the dielectric channel walls because of electron bombard-
ment. In the example efficiency calculation above, approximately 25% of the power going into
the thruster was deposited on the channel walls. The metallic walls in TAL thrusters collect a smal-
ler electron current because they are biased to cathode potential, and also tend to have a small
exposed area in poor contact with the plasma which limits the amount of ion and power lost to
these surfaces. However, the anode is positioned very close to the high electron temperature region,
and receives a significant amount of power deposition in collecting the discharge current. In the
example TAL efficiency calculation above, over 20% of the power going into the thruster was depos-
ited on the anode.
The deep channel in dielectric-wall Hall thrusters, with a low magnetic field strength and low
electron temperature near the anode, tends to minimize the power deposition on the anode. In
the simple example above, only 1% of the thruster input power was deposited on the anode. Nev-
ertheless, the anode is normally electrically isolated from the thruster body (and therefore ther-
mally isolated), and so anode overheating is sometimes an issue, especially at high power

density. The anode in TAL thrusters can also have heating issues because the loading is much
higher, even though the view-factor for the anode to radiate its power out of the thruster is better
than the deep channel in the insulating-wall configuration. In addition, with the anode positioned
physically close to the thruster exit in TALs, impurity deposition and material buildup problems
can occur. This has been an issue in ground testing of some TAL thrusters [33] where carbon dep-
osition on the anode from backsputtering from the beam dump became significant over time. TAL
thrusters with deeper channels can be designed and operated [4]. The performance of the thruster is
likely different in this configuration, and ion bombardment and sputtering of the metallic channel
walls can become significant and affect the thruster life.
Dielectric-wall Hall thrusters are often described in terms of an ionization zone upstream of the
exit plane and an acceleration zone in the region of the exit plane. TAL thrusters have a similar
ionization region near the magnetic field maximum, which is now closer to the anode because
the magnetic field gradient is greater. The TAL acceleration zone is described as being a layer close
to the anode [1, 4] and can extend outside of the thruster [51]. The higher electron temperatures
associated with TAL thrusters support higher electric fields in the quasi-neutral plasma, which
compresses these zones relative to dielectric-wall thrusters. In addition, the metallic walls and
higher electric fields are conducive to multiple acceleration stages, which can improve thruster per-
formance and produce higher Isp than a conventional single stage TAL thruster [53, 54]. Multiple-
stage dielectric-wall Hall thrusters that operate at high Isp have also been investigated (see [20] and
the references cited therein).
Finally, the difference between dielectric-wall Hall thrusters and TAL thrusters is sometimes
attributed to the secondary electron coefficients of the different wall materials. The discussion
above shows that this is not the dominant difference. Instead, the proximity of the TAL anode elec-
trode to the high temperature plasma region and the thruster exit plane is what changes the electric
field profile, power deposition and sputtering characteristics compared to the dielectric-wall Hall
thruster.
7.4
Discharge Dynamics and Oscillations
Depending on their size and operating characteristics, Hall thrusters can produce a wide range of
plasma oscillations, with frequencies from 1 kHz to 10’s of MHz. A survey of these discharge
dynamics, covering waves and instabilities that can be excited in a SPT was compiled by Choueiri
[55]. Estimates of several characteristic frequencies of relevance in the SPT discharge chamber is
provided in Fig. 7-14. The values were determined using as initial input probe measurements taken
inside the channel by Bishaev and Kim [56, 57]. The SPT in that study had a diameter of 10 cm and
operated with xenon propellant at a discharge voltage and current of 200 V and 3 - to - 3.2 A, respec-
tively. The estimates encompass several natural frequencies associated with electrons and ions, spe-
cifically: the cyclotron, plasma and lower-hybrid frequencies as well as several collision
frequencies. Both elastic and inelastic collisions were evaluated, between not only the two charged
species but also between those species and neutrals.
Owing to their strong connection to thruster performance and stability, the most widely studied
oscillations have been those associated with ionization instabilities in the annular discharge chan-
nel. They are observed to occur at frequencies in the tens of kHz. An example of a measurement
made in an SPT-100 exhibiting a
17 kHz discharge current oscillation is shown in Fig. 7-15 from
[59]. These types of oscillations are typically seen in the discharge current when the thruster is

operated in a voltage regulated mode and have been called “breathing modes” [58] and “predator-
prey modes” [34].
The time dependence of the low-frequency oscillations can be seen from a simple analytical
model [34] that describes the ion and neutral behavior. The ion conservation equation is written
as

The low frequency oscillatory behavior of Hall thrusters is proportional to the velocities of the ions
and neutrals relative to the scale length of the ionization zone. The periodic depletion of the neutral
gas in the ionization region causes the ion density to fall, and the frequency is then dependent on
the neutral velocity driven time needed for the neutral flow from the periphery to replenish the
region and restart the ionization. The ion density then oscillates, which impacts the electron con-
ductivity through the transverse magnetic field and thereby the discharge current. The ionization
region location will also oscillate axially in the channel on the time scale of neutral replenishment
time. The specific frequency these breathing modes exhibit depends on several factors including the
operating conditions, applied magnetic field and channel geometry.
Using an electrostatic High-speed Dual Langmuir Probe (HDLP) system, Lobbia and Gallimore
[60] surveyed the behavior of these modes in a 600-W xenon Hall thruster under various operating
conditions. The measurements revealed the rich dynamic behavior of the discharge in this fre-
quency range. Figure 7-16 shows the power spectral density (PSD) of the discharge current

oscillations observed at different discharge voltage and current settings. The dominant lowest-
frequency peak of the breathing mode can be seen in all traces. As the thruster discharge voltage
or the mean discharge current increased, the breathing mode frequency also increased. At the lower
discharge voltages (150 V and 200 V), at least five harmonics of the mode’s fundamental frequency
also were observed, spanning frequencies up through 100 kHz.
Due to the significance of the breathing mode on thruster performance and stability, the study of
these oscillations in the laboratory has been supported by extensive physics-based analyses using
models of various levels of complexity. The modeling of these and other oscillations in the Hall
thruster, as well as its time-averaged behavior comprise the topic of the next section.
7.5
Channel Physics and Numerical Modeling
Significant progress has been made in the last couple decades in understanding the physics of E × B
discharges on which Hall thruster performance depends [61]. Reviews on how these physics are
modeled in Hall thrusters and the state of that understanding have been recently reported in
[62–64]. However, several aspects of how Hall thrusters work remain poorly understood. For exam-
ple, the true electron distribution function in the vicinity of the acceleration region, the mechan-
isms responsible for electron transport across the applied magnetic field, and the role of oscillations
on the particle transport and discharge stability all need further investigation.
In this section we provide a basic set of the conservation equations used in the modeling of these
thrusters. Due to their characteristic operational principle, which forces electrons to be highly mag-
netized and ions to be unmagnetized, we focus more on the electron equations. Of course, to prop-
erly account for all the physical processes in a model of a Hall thruster all the appropriate equations
governing conservation of mass, momentum and energy for the heavy species (ions and neutrals)
must be solved. Moreover, all these equations must be subject to appropriate boundary conditions,
which can be quite complex and markedly consequential in Hall thrusters [36, 65–68].
The subsection on the basic model equations is followed by a few examples of numerical models
and simulations. We are well aware that an extensive amount of work has been performed since the
early numerical modeling efforts of the 1990s. Our goal is not to provide an extensive review of this
quite vibrant area of Hall thruster research, but rather to touch on some of the more salient aspects
of physics-based modeling in these devices.
7.5.1
Basic Model Equations
Many Hall thruster models utilize a steady state fluid electron momentum equation and a time
dependent electron energy equation to solve for the electron temperature and plasma potential
in the channel and plume. The electron momentum equation after neglecting electron inertia
and the thermoelectric effect can be expressed as
E + ue × B = Re
ene
−∇pe
ene
7 5-1
where the electron pressure tensor has been simplified as pe = peI (with I being the delta tensor).
The drag force density Re represents changes in the electron momentum as a result of collisions
with ions and neutrals and leads to the resistive contribution to the electric field E as follows:
Re
ene
= ηei + ηen Je + ηeiJi
7 5-2
7.5 Channel Physics and Numerical Modeling
301

where ηei and ηen are the resistivities due to electron-ion and electron-neutral collisions and Je and
Ji are the electron and ion current densities respectively. In general, for momentum transfer colli-
sions between electrons and species “s” that occur at a mean frequency of <νes> the resistivity is
given by
ηes = m νes
e2ne
7 5-3
Here we have dropped the angle brackets < > for convenience. Let us now define an effective elec-
tric field
E
E + ∇pe
ene
−ηeiJi,
7 5-4
which allows us to write Eq. 7.5-1 in the form of Ohm’s law:
Je = E
η −ΩeJe × β
7 5-5
where we have combined the two collisional contributions to the resistivity into a single value η =
ηei + ηen. Also, B = Bβ with β being the unit vector in the direction of the magnetic flux density B.
With the electron cyclotron frequency denoted by ωc, the Hall parameter can be written as
Ωe =
B
eneη = ωc
νe
7 5-6
As with the resistivity η, in the presence of only ions and neutrals it is implied that we have com-
bined the momentum transfer collision frequencies for electrons into a single frequency
νe = νei + νen
7 5-7
We can now express the electron current density in the parallel, Je

directions, Je⊥

The transverse components are sometimes expressed using the subscript “ ”, that is, a

7.5.1.1
Electron Motion Perpendicular to the Magnetic Field
In the absence of an applied electric field in the transverse direction or any induced components in
that direction that permit a non-zero average value (such as instability driven fluctuations), then
E × β = 0 and we can combine the last two expressions in Eqs 7.5-8 to write the effective electric
field in the perpendicular direction as
E⊥= η 1 + Ω2
e Je⊥
7 5-9
302
7 Conventional Hall Thrusters

Equation 7.5-9 illustrates the fundamental distinction between Hall thrusters and gridded ion
engines regarding the generation of the accelerating force on ions. In the latter the electric field
on the ions is generated through direct application of a voltage difference in the grid system,
whereas in the former, Je × β is responsible for the force (see Eq. 7.5-8) in compliance with Ohm’s
law. It is this operational principle that in some cases puts Hall thrusters in the category of elec-
tromagnetic (versus electrostatic) thrusters in the literature. Most physics models we will be dis-
cussing in the ensuing sections attempt to solve numerically or analytically Eq. 7.5-9 or some
close variant for the electric field after assuming the discharge is quasi-neutral.
It is also common to use the electron mobility instead of the resistivity. In the perpendicular direc-
tion, with η⊥= η 1 + Ω2
e
the two are related as follows:
μ⊥=
μ
1 + Ω2
e
=
1
eneη⊥
7 5-10
This expression for the perpendicular electron mobility accounts for both electron-ion and electron-
neutral collisions. The perpendicular electron current density may then be written as
Je⊥= μ⊥eneE⊥+ ∇⊥pe −μ⊥
μei
Ji⊥
7 5-11
and the electron mobility due only to electron-ion collisions is given by μei = e/meνei. In many cases
it is possible to neglect the last term on the right-hand side which simplifies Eq. 7.5-11 further.
Since the electrons are strongly magnetized near the exit of the channel where the magnetic field
strength is the highest, the electron Hall parameter (Eq. 7.5-6) is much greater than unity. Hence
the perpendicular resistivity, which follows the proportionality η⊥
B2/νene under these condi-
tions, can be quite high. In fact, calculations of the electron collision frequency νe based on classical
collisions only (Eq. 7.5-7) show it is too high. This leads to insufficient cross-field transport of
electrons to support the discharge current passing through the thruster (see for example [61]
and references therein). Therefore, in what is likely an over-idealized approximation, an effective
or “anomalous” collision frequency να is simply added to the total to reduce the resistance on the
electrons imposed by the magnetic field, as follows:
νe = νei + νen + να
7 5-12
Two mechanisms were originally proposed to capture the “anomalous” cross-field electron trans-
port. Morozov [3] postulated that electron-wall interactions in the channel region will scatter elec-
tron momentum and introduce secondary electrons, which can increase the effective cross-field
transport. This effect is introduced into the effective collision frequency by a wall scattering fre-
quency νw, that is, να = νw. With ζ being an adjustable parameter used to match the experimental
data, the wall scattering frequency is either given by ζ × 107 s−1 [58] or the wall collision frequency
of electrons is determined directly in a numerical simulation [69]. While this effect does increase
the electron transport in the channel, it has in many cases been found to provide insufficient
enhancement of the electron transport. In addition, in the plume of the thruster there are no walls
and the neutral density is very low, which precludes the use of νw to increase the cross-field trans-
port sufficiently to explain the experimental data. Yet, as we will show later, much of the anomalous
collision frequency is needed in the vicinity of the acceleration channel exit and near-plume of the
thruster.
Additional cross-field transport was then proposed by invoking Bohm diffusion both inside and
outside the thruster channel. As discussed in Chapter 3, Bohm diffusion likely arises from E × B
7.5 Channel Physics and Numerical Modeling
303

driven drift instabilities, postulated to occur naturally in these thrusters because of the Hall current.
Using the Bohm diffusion coefficient from Eq. 3.6-72 and the Einstein relationship of Eq. 3.6-28, a
Bohm mobility can be defined as
μB = 1
βB =
e
βmωc
7 5-13
where β is an adjustable coefficient. If the discharge is subject to full Bohm diffusion, then β = 16.
The effective Bohm collision frequency is then νB = βωc and the total “anomalous” collision fre-
quency is
να = νw + νB,
7 5-14
with νw neglected in the plume. The inclusion of the “Bohm” anomalous collision frequency gained
significant popularity in the early numerical simulations of Hall thrusters largely because it allowed
for the prediction of general discharge properties and thruster performance to within acceptable
levels of accuracy. As both numerical simulations and plasma diagnostics advanced however, it
became more evident that the diffusion of electrons in the acceleration region and into the channel
was far from “Bohm-like.” This is discussed further in Section 7.5.2.2. Before ending this section,
perhaps of historical interest is the fact that the earlier hydrodynamic models proposed by Morozov
et al. did not incorporate Bohm diffusion at all. In fact, in his 2001 monograph [3], referring to
Bohm’s formula for the anomalous electrical conductivity σ = 1/η, Morozov stated: The appearance
of Bohm’s formula (in the 1940’)] convinced practically all gas-discharge physicists that σ⊥1/H (with
H being the magnetic field strength)]. However, experiments carried out at Kurchatov AEI (Atomic
Energy Institute) in 1963-64 in the Shchepkin-Morozov laboratory showed that this is not the case.
The value of σ⊥proved to be at least an order of magnitude smaller than that given by Bohm’s formula.
Several years later the same result was obtained in tokamaks.”

parallel direction are finite. In fact, the left-hand side ratios in Eq. 7.5-15 above may attain, in prin-
ciple, any value along a given magnetic field line. For example, consider such a line that is perpen-

where subscript “R” denotes reference values along the line. The equation for the potential was
derived in Section 3.5.1 and represents the Boltzmann relation for plasmas with Maxwellian elec-
tron distribution function. The right-hand side is often called the thermalized potential [3] in Hall
thruster literature and is sometimes denoted by ϕ∗.
In thrusters with a largely radial magnetic field inside the acceleration channel it is usually the
case that the density gradient along the magnetic field is relatively small, so the potential change
along a line is essentially zero since Te ln(n/nR) ≈0. Therefore, such magnetic field lines also rep-
resent equipotential lines in the plasma. The thermalized potential has therefore been used for
many years [3, 4] in the design of Hall thrusters to relate the magnetic field shape to the electric
field in the plasma. In thrusters with more curved magnetic field lines, like those employing mag-
netic shielding topologies that will be discussed in Chapter 8 or in the near-thruster and cathode
plumes, where the Hall parameter can be significantly smaller, such simplifying approximations
can often introduce significant error. This is discussed further in ensuing sections.
7.5.1.3
Electron Continuity and Energy Conversation
Mass continuity for the charged species in the plasma can be expressed in terms of the total current
density J = Je + Ji as follows
∇J = 0
7 5-18
In addition, charge balance at the insulating wall dictates that
Ji = Je −Jse,
7 5-19
where Jse is the secondary electron current density, which is equal to the secondary electron yield
times the incident electron flux. The boundary conditions related to the sheath that forms along
these boundaries are very important in the modeling of Hall thrusters and have therefore been dis-
cussed quite extensively in the literature. This topic is beyond the scope of this chapter however so
we refer the reader to the non-exhaustive collection of references in [36, 43, 67–69].
The electric field in the perpendicular direction can be solved for using Eq. 7.5-11. The solution
then allows us to determine the voltage drop V along a path l of length Λ from the anode to the

Heavy Species: Ion and Neutrals
The treatment of ions has been wide-ranging in the modeling of Hall thrusters. This is illustrated by
a few representative estimates of the relevant characteristic length scales using plasma conditions
from a 6-kW laboratory thruster and an SPT, identified in Fig. 7-17 as “1” and “2”, respectively.

Given an acceleration channel of length L, the ion transit time τu = L/ui for a ion drift velocity ui
can range approximately from (0.03 m)/(2 × 104 m/s−1) = 1.5 μs, for those ions that are accelerated
downstream of the acceleration channel, to (0.01 m)/(5 × 102 m/s−1) = 10 μs for those generated
near the anode region and lost to the walls. For comparison, the thermal equilibration time between
electrons and ions, τei ≈τe M/2m (with τe being the electron relaxation time and M the ion mass)
ranges 0.03–0.5 s inside the channel, which implies that the ions remain “cold” relative to the elec-
trons. The (thermal) mean free path (mfp) for ion-ion collisions λii = υiτi with υi = (2kTi/M)½ being
the ion thermal speed, is plotted in Fig. 7-17 (top) along the middle of the acceleration channel in
the two different Hall thrusters for various values of the ion temperature [70]. The axial direction
and channel length are z and L, respectively. It is noted that although a case of 5000 K ions is plotted
here, this is an extreme value since the channel walls typically do not exceed 1000 K. It is also the
case that the ion density can in fact be substantially higher in the anode region compared to the
values used here. This would suggest even smaller collision mfps for ions in this region than
those plotted in Fig. 7-17. Also, Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) measurements of Xe+ inside
the 6-kW Hall thruster have shown that ions follow very closely the equilibrium distribution func-
tion [71], which further strengthens the continuum assumption for the ions in this region.
Depicted in Fig. 7-17 (bottom) is the charge-exchange collision mfp for ions colliding with atoms
of number density nn as estimated by λin = (σinnn,)−1. The mfp is plotted for two values of the ion-
neutral charge-exchange cross section σin, 50 Å2 and 100 Å2. Based on the measurements of Miller,
et al. [72], the two values cover the range of typical ion energies attained in the acceleration chan-
nel, <1–300 eV, with the highest value of the cross section representing the lowest energy ions. For
comparison, the characteristic mfp for self-collisions between neutrals λnn = (πnnD2
2)−1 is also
plotted in Fig. 7-17 (bottom) using a mean atomic diameter for Xe of D = 2.6 Å. It is worthwhile
noting that the addition of charge-exchange collisions can become increasingly important in the
anode region since the electric force can be negligibly small there [73].
It is apparent then from the estimates in Fig. 7-17 that in many cases, depending on the specific
thruster conditions and geometry, ions can be treated using continuum approximations inside the
channel without significantly degrading the accuracy of the solution. In such an approach the
momentum equation is solved, expressed below in conservative form as
∂
∂t nmu i + ∇
nmuu i = eniE −∇pi + Ri
7 5-24
By comparison to the same conservation equation for the electrons Eq. 7.5-1, the absence of the
ui × B term is noted since the ions are considered unmagnetized. Also, in Eq. 7.5-24 the viscous
terms have been neglected and the ion pressure tensor has again been simplified as pi = piI (with
I being the delta tensor). The drag force density Ri represents changes in the ion momentum as a
result of collisions between ions and other species and, in general, may be composed of both elastic
and inelastic components [70].
Even though the continuum approximation for ions can be valid in certain regions of Hall thrus-
ters, the range of ion mean free paths and energies in these devices can vary enough that, many
times, the use of discrete-particle methods is more accurate or simpler to use. For example, though
ion collisions can be frequent enough inside the channel, they can become quite rare as ions exit the
channel. Under such conditions, multifluid [70, 74] or direct-kinetic methods [75] have also been
used, separately or in some combination with discrete-particle methods. For example, in [58] an
idealized form of Boltzmann’s equation for the ion distribution function has been used to solve
for the ion generation and motion. This has primarily been applied for investigating low frequency

where f is the ion distribution function and δ(υx −υo) is the Dirac delta function evaluated for the
ion velocity υx relative to the neutral velocity υ0. The ion density is then found from
ni =
f x, υx, t dυx
7 5-26
For neutrals, the modeling method is more straightforward since the collision mean free paths
between them are consistently much larger than the characteristic size of the channel in Hall thrus-
ters. It is therefore most accurate to use particle [76–78] or view factor methods [70, 79] for these
species but in a manner that properly takes in to account loss of neutrals by ionization collisions
with electrons and interactions with the walls. Both these processes can affect markedly the spa-
tiotemporal characteristics of the discharge.
To properly capture the evolution of the heavy species the above equations should be accompa-
nied by conservation laws for mass continuity and boundary conditions that appropriately capture
their interactions with the thruster surfaces.
7.5.2
Numerical Modeling and Simulations
The numerical simulation of Hall thrusters now spans more than three decades. Although the
first theoretical models of the partially-ionized gas in an SPT were, in fact, reported in the 1970s
by Morozov et al. [80–82], it was not until the 1990s that a considerable effort began. These early
efforts focused on the development of fluid, kinetic, particle-in-cell (PIC) and/or hybrid models for
predicting performance and for explaining some of the observed behavior in these thrusters. Nat-
urally, it was easier to begin with solutions in one dimension before moving to multiple dimensions,
an effort that proved to be quite insightful for many aspects of Hall thruster physics.
7.5.2.1
Modeling in One Dimension
It was recognized very early that modeling the flow field inside the channel would be extremely
challenging, owing largely to the complexity of the electron physics and the inherently wide range
of temporal and spatial scales of the light (electrons) and heavy species (neutrals and ions). Thus,
the natural evolution from 0-D scalings and pure empiricism involved the numerical solutions of
idealized models in one dimension, most often along the axis of symmetry. It is interesting to note,
despite the popularity of more modern numerical methodologies that incorporate discrete-particle
methods for the heavy species, the earliest approach for these species followed purely hydrody-
namic formalisms (e.g. see [82] reported in the early 1980s). It was not until the mid-1990s that
the so-called “hybrid” approach, which ultimately became the most commonly-used approach
in the 2-D numerical modeling of Hall thrusters, was attempted in 1-D simulations (for example,
see Morozov and Savelyev in [83]). The word “hybrid” here is used in reference to the different
methods followed to obtain solutions for the charged species: the ion motion is determined by sol-
ving a kinetic equation for the ion distribution function or by using discrete-particle methods
whereas the electrons are treated using the continuum equations.
Despite the complexity of the physics in these thrusters, 1-D numerical models showed they could
provide useful insight into both steady-state and transient trends. For example, Fig. 7-18 plots

along the channel axis the time-average profiles of the potential, electric field, plasma density, mean
electron energy, neutral density and ionization rate for the SPT-100 predicted by one of the earliest
1-D numerical models, developed by Boeuf and Garrigues [58] in the late 1990s. The model
assumed that the discharge is quasi-neutral and used a transient hybrid treatment for the electron
and ion transport in the device; electrons were treated as a fluid and ions were described by a col-
lision-less kinetic equation. In Fig. 7-18 the position of the channel exit is at 4 cm. The average
plasma density peaks upstream of the exit for the thruster channel. There is a characteristic peak
in the plasma density upstream of the channel exit in the ionization region, and a decreasing
plasma density is seen moving out of the channel as the ions are accelerated in the electric field
of the acceleration region. The profiles in Fig. 7-18 suggest that three overlapping but distinct
regions exist in the plasma channel of a Hall thruster. Near the anode, the potential drop is small
because of the low magnetic field in this region, resulting in good plasma conduction to the anode
but small ionization. The ionization zone occurs upstream of the channel exit where the neutral gas
density is still high and the electrons are well confined and have significant temperature. The accel-
eration zone exists near the channel exit where the electric field is a maximum, which occurs at this
location because the magnetic field is a maximum and the transverse electron mobility is signifi-
cantly reduced as described above. Outside the channel, the electric field, plasma density and elec-
tron temperature drop as the magnetic field strength decays and the Hall current decreases.
Interestingly, the study also showed that this simple model could not predict experimental obser-
vations if the electron mobility in the perpendicular direction was based only on classical electron-
neutral collisions. In fact, including Bohm conductivity did not improve the comparison with
experiments either. Qualitatively better results were obtained only after the contribution of
electron-wall interactions was included. As it will be discussed in the next section, this is in contrast
to the results from some of the first 2-D simulations performed around the same time. It turns out
that now, decades later, although good progress has been made on the likely anomalous processes
and how to model them [84–88], a first-principles universal model of the anomalous transport
across the magnetic field remains elusive. Nevertheless, such reduced-dimension models served
as useful and fast modeling tools, not only in providing insight on steady-state trends but also
on some of the well-observed transient behavior of these thrusters. For example, the 1-D numerical
model predictions in [58] for the total current, electron and ion current at the thruster exit are
shown in Fig. 7-19 for the SPT-100. In this case, a breathing frequency of 16 kHz is predicted, in
good agreement with the aforementioned measurements in the same thruster.
Owing to the relative simplicity and need for fast engineering guidance in the development of
these thrusters, low-dimensionality models like the one by Boeuf and Garrigues have continued
to be pursued by the community (e.g. see [41, 59, 89–93]. Their limited scope has also become more
evident however since the solution must depend on a wide range of model inputs that, themselves,
can vary significanly. One major challenge, for example, is a model’s assumption of the anomalous
collision frequency. To illustrate why this is a challenge, the results from a sensitivity study per-
formed by Hara and Mikellides [94] using a 1-D fluid model of a 6-kW Hall thruster are shown
in Fig. 7-20. The top figure plots the prescribed anomalous collision frequency as a function of axial
distance z from the anode, with L being the channel length. The bottom figure depicts the dynamic
response of the solution for the discharge current. The legend lists different values of the coefficient
used to prescribe the anomalous collision frequency in the channel interior. The profiles are similar
to those reported in [99, 104] and were determined based on a combination of 2-D axisymmetric
simulations and plasma measurements. It was found that the details of the anomalous collision
frequency in the acceleration channel, which as we mentioned before remain elusive today, can
affect appreciably the dynamic behavior of the discharge in the simulation. The dynamics can also
310
7 Conventional Hall Thrusters

be sensitive to the numerical method(s) employed to discretize and solve the equations [94]. Other
“free” or uncertain parameters, such as those used to model the interactions of both the heavy and
light species with the solid boundaries, can affect the solution as well. This strong sensitivity of 1-D
models is one of the many reasons that higher-dimensionality models are frequently pursued
despite their increased complexity and computational cost.
7.5.2.2
Modeling in Multiple Dimensions
Some of the earliest simulations in two dimensions (2-D) were in fact performed using the PIC
method for all species [95]. It soon became evident however that modeling both electrons and
the heavy species using such methods at the time was prohibitively costly in computational time
and could only offer limited insight. In response, a hybrid computational approach was adopted
allowing simulations to capture the bulk plasma phenomena and ion kinetics in the thruster, in
2-D, and within reasonable computational times. For that reason, hybrid approaches became quite
common in the simulation of Hall thrusters and their popularity has continued to this day. Since the
mid-1990s an extensive body of work has been published in this area. Attempting to cover these
efforts here, in a manner that covers all the important advancements while also properly acknowl-
edging the many researchers who have contributed to this area, would be a futile effort. Instead, we
have selected to discuss in some detail only two examples of computational codes developed spe-
cifically for the modeling of Hall thruster physics because they encompass many of the most com-
mon approaches employed in the simulation of these devices today. Wherever suitable however
we provide additional references to other important methods and findings.
Hybrid-PIC Hall (HPHall)
One of the first 2-D models to follow the hybrid approach was developed at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Fife and Martínez-Sánchez in the late 1990s [34, 38].
The code called “Hybrid-PIC Hall” (HPHall) had a seminal impact on the numerical simulation of

simulation is 11 kHz. The characteristic ionization processes driving the oscillations were found to
be the same as those obtained by the 1-D simulations described in the previous section [58]. These
low frequency oscillations can reach 100% of the discharge current depending on the voltage and
mass flow (current) for a given thruster design. However, more modern designs typically have
much lower oscillation amplitudes. In the HPHall simulations Bohm diffusion was invoked for
the electron fluid across the magnetic field (Eq. 7.5-13), which yielded 2-D plasma profiles that were
similar to those observed in some (but not all) experiments [96]. Typical 2-D time-averaged con-
tours of the plasma density from an SPT-100 simulation are shown in Fig. 7-22. As in the 1-D results
of Fig. 7-15, the average plasma density peaks upstream of the exit of the thruster channel. In both
cases, there is a characteristic maximum upstream of the channel exit in the ionization region, and a
decreasing plasma density is seen moving out of the channel as the ions are accelerated by the elec-
tric field in the acceleration region. Similar hybrid models ensued by others [76, 78]. The early suc-
cess of HPHall motivated additional development of the code later that led to improved sheath and
channel erosion models [13, 50, 97, 98].
It is worthwhile noting here that despite the fundamentally different anomalous mobility models
used in the two simulations, the peak plasma density in the 1-D code ( 5 × 1017 m−3) is only slightly
lower than the 2-D HPHall result ( 8 × 1017 m−3). This exposes a major hurdle in Hall thruster
modeling that continues to be prevalent today: the lack of a first-principles model for the anoma-
lous resistivity challenges our ability to validate unambiguously these models and impairs our
capacity to produce truly predictive simulations. The reader may recall the example in
Section 7.5.2.1 related to the sensitivity of breathing mode 1-D models on the details of the anom-
alous resistivity profile. Similar challenges are encountered in the validation of the 2-D time-
averaged results also, as discussed in more detail by Mikellides and Lopez Ortega [99]. The subject
is revisited later in this section.

7.5 Channel Physics and Numerical Modeling
313

One of the novel approaches employed in HPHall was based on the fundamental principle in Hall
thrusters that the acceleration of ions is achieved by operating the discharge at high electron Hall
parameter (Ωe > 100). Under these conditions, the resistance to the transport of mass and heat in
the electron flow in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field is much greater (by
Ωe
2) than
that in the parallel direction for most of the acceleration channel (Section 7.5.1.2). This allows for
the solution of the electron transport equations only in the direction that is perpendicular to the
magnetic field. Numerically, this so-called “quasi-1-D assumption” allowed for the discretization
of the electron equations in a quadrilateral computational element that is bounded by two adjacent
lines of force, rather than an element with arbitrary dimensions as shown in Fig. 7-23. The simpli-
fication reduced both the complexity and computational cost of numerical simulations in 2-D.

7 Conventional Hall Thrusters

Hall Thruster with 2-D Electrons (Hall2De)
In conventional Hall thrusters that employ a largely radial
magnetic field (like SPTs), the quasi-1D assumption does not significantly degrade the accuracy of
the solution inside the acceleration channel and in the very near-plume regions of the domain
where the Hall parameter is quite large. The assumption is challenged however in regions with
more complex magnetic fields. Examples are topologies near eroded walls and in the new gener-
ation of these devices called magnetically shielded thrusters that will be discussed in Chapter 8. The
assumption also fails in regions with lower Hall parameter such as those near the anode and in the
cathode plume.
To properly model these more complex cases, a solution to at least the 2-D form of Ohm’s cannot
be avoided. However, because of the inherently large disparity of the electron transport in the two
directions relative to the applied magnetic field, this can be numerically very challenging. Employ-
ment of magnetic field-aligned meshes (MFAM) is a long-standing computational approach for
simulating highly anisotropic plasmas, and is widely used nowadays especially by the sustained
fusion energy community [100–103]. The first code to pursue this path in Hall thruster simulations
was named “Hall with 2D electrons” (Hall2De) and was developed by Mikellides and Katz [70, 79]
in the late 2000s. Hall2De solved the axisymmetric vector form of Ohm’s law in the r-z domain and
avoided the employment of discrete-particle or kinetic methods in the treatment of the heavy spe-
cies in the first versions of the code. Using predefined energy bins, the ions were modeled as mul-
tiple fluids [70, 74] and the neutrals were treated using line-of-sight formulations that account for
ionization collisions and collisions with walls [79]. More recently, PIC/DSMC modules were incor-
porated to capture the details of the ion velocity distributions functions making Hall2De a hybrid
(multifluid/PIC-ion fluid-electron) code for the charged species [104, 105].
The magnetic field-aligned mesh was necessary to eliminate excessive numerical diffusion that
would otherwise be caused by the anisotropy of the electron transport coefficients when solving the
equations on a regular mesh. Referring to Fig. 7-24 (middle), in this approach the plasma potential
ϕi is solved for on each computational element “i” after combining Ohm’s law for the electrons
(Eq. 7.5-5) with current conservation Eq. 7.5-18. At each new time step t+Δt and at each face
“k” of area ΔAk of element “i”, the dot products of the current density needed in a finite volume

where n

of the current density have been implied: J =
J ∙β β and J⊥= −β ×
β × J , with the unit
vector in the direction of the magnetic field given by β = βrr + βzz. The novel part of this approach
is that nr and nz can be simplified considerably on a MFAM because the element faces are either
parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field lines. Numerical diffusion because of the disparity
between the terms that depend on Ωe and those that do not is practically eliminated in this way. The
accuracy of the solution then depends on the extent of the spatial deviations of the mesh from the
true lines of constant potential and stream functions χ and ψ. Here χ and ψ are the set of conjugate
harmonic functions satisfying the Cauchy-Riemann conditions for the radial and axial components
of the magnetic field. A set of such lines in the acceleration channel of a typical Hall thruster are
shown in Fig. 7-24 (left). The corresponding MFAM is shown in Fig. 7-24 (right).
7.5 Channel Physics and Numerical Modeling

Hall2De was the first code to use a MFAM in the simulation of Hall thrusters. A similar MFAM
code was developed later by Domínguez-Vázquez, et al. [106]. The employment of an MFAM in
Hall2De, with other advancements made in the code based on the many lessons learned from
HPHall and other similar codes, led to several new insights. Most well-known is the code’s critical
role in the derivation of the fundamental principles of magnetic shielding [69, 107] to be described
in Chapter 8. Considering the impact of magnetic shielding in Hall thrusters, a separate chapter is
dedicated solely to this topic so we will not pursue this here any further. There have been a few
other notable insights gained from the Hall2De simulations over the years, however, that are worth
summarizing here.
The generalization to a full 2-D solution of Ohm’s law allowed for a much larger computation
area than previous codes (like HPHall). An example of a typical simulation domain, its correspond-
ing MFAM and results for the ion density are shown in Fig. 7-25. Among others, this larger MFAM
domain allowed simulations to encompass the cathode boundary where the lines of force can
become non-isothermal. In Fig. 7-26 the computed electron temperature contours are shown in
the entire computational region (left) and in the vicinity of the acceleration channel (right) of a
typical Hall thruster operating with a center-mounted cathode. The contours are overlaid by
selected arrowed lines tangent to the magnetic vector field (called hereinafter “streamlines” and
loosely associated with the appropriate definition of the term in fluid velocity vector fields) to illus-
trate that in the majority of the computational domain the isothermalization of the lines of force is
indeed preserved. Deviations do occur however in the cathode region because of the high collision-
ality of the plasma there. This allowed simulations to employ cathode boundary conditions unam-
biguously thereby capturing the interactions of the cathode-thruster plasma flows more accurately
[108]. Therefore, unlike HPHall and other codes that rely on the quasi-1D assumption, Hall2De
does not assume that the electron temperature remains fixed along magnetic field lines.
Perhaps equally important have been the insights gained from Hall2De simulations on the ques-
tion of the anomalous electron transport. As it was noted earlier, the first numerical models of Hall
thrusters assumed some combination of wall collisions and Bohm diffusion (Eq. 7.5-14). As more
plasma measurements were performed however, it became clear that neither the two processes
applied separately nor their combination could reproduce accurately these measurements in the

vicinity of the acceleration region. This prompted some researchers to divide the computational
domain in 2–3 different regions and apply a different coefficient β (see Eq. 7.5-13) in each region
(e.g. [109]). In retrospect, this was simply the beginning of the realization that Bohm diffusion phys-
ics were simply not present in the Hall thruster. Ultimately, the strongest argument against Bohm-
driven transport was established after several years of Hall2De comparisons with plasma and wall
erosion measurements in different thrusters. To be more specific, Mikellides and Lopez Ortega [99]
incorporated in Hall2De a multi-variable function for να and combined it with LIF measurements of
the ion velocity to determine the function’s coefficients. This allowed them to obtain a semi-
empirically derived profile of the anomalous collision frequency in the acceleration channel and
near-plume. A similar effort to determine the anomalous collision frequency from a combination
of probe measurements and 2-D simulations (using a code similar to HPHall) was pursued several
years earlier at Stanford University [110, 111]. In the more recent effort with Hall2De however a
much more resolved and accurate set of measurements was attained from LIF diagnostics, that also
spanned the acceleration region and the near-plume. This allowed the simulations to capture the
spatial variation of the collision frequency much more accurately in these regions. An example of
comparisons between Hall2De simulations and LIF measurements for the ion velocity field is pro-
vided [112] in Fig. 7-27. The mathematical formulation of the piecewise function for να is described
in [99].
Typical Hall2De solutions for να along the channel centerline of a magnetically shielded Hall
thruster and comparisons with ion velocity measurements for two different magnetic flux densities
(B1 and B2) are illustrated in Fig. 7-28. The results are plotted as a function of the axial direction z,

along the centerline of the acceleration channel with length L. The channel exit is at z/L = 1. Also
shown for direct comparison with να is the electron cyclotron frequency ωc. The comparisons
underscore the following critical findings: (i) the marked differences between Bohm-diffusion scal-
ing νB
ωc and the empirical-numerical result for να and, (ii) the dominance of the anomalous con-
tribution to the total collision frequency in a large portion of the channel interior over that from
only (classical) electron-ion (e-i) and electron-neutral (e-n) collisions. Although these trends have
been found in more than one Hall thrusters (e.g. [104, 113, 114]), in the absence of a first-principles
model of να the possibility of a different behavior cannot be dismissed. Nevertheless, profiles like
the ones shown in Fig. 7-28 serve as some of the most accurate estimates of the spatial variation of
the anomalous collision frequency we have to-date for these thrusters (at least along the channel
centerline). The significance of this is that numerical simulations may be employed to test the valid-
ity of theories associated with the anomalous transport in these devices, before they are implemen-
ted as first-principles models in r-z electron-fluid codes.
The approach of combining detailed non-intrusive measurements and 2-D simulations to deter-
mine the anomalous collision frequency does not yet allow for a fully-predictive modeling capabil-
ity. However, in addition to providing a testbed for electron transport models and insight into to the
physics of a variety of other processes that occur in these devices, such capability can (and does) also
guide thruster design. Perhaps even more important is the support such modeling capabilities can
provide in thruster qualification for deep-space missions. A unique challenge with these missions is
that because the Hall thruster is usually required to operate for many thousands of hours in space,
many times it is simply impossible (due to time and cost constraints) to demonstrate its life in the
laboratory for the entire throttle range and under true space vacuum conditions. The path to space

qualification therefore, inevitably, must cross both laboratory testing and physics-based modeling,
and it is the latter to which codes like Hall2De offer the greatest contribution. Specifically, once
validated and informed by plasma diagnostics, these codes can provide predictions of thruster wear
and throughput, for the entire mission profile and in true space vacuum.
Simulations of wave propagation and instabilities in multiple dimensions. The elusiveness of the
anomalous transport coefficients in Hall thrusters has led to a wide range of computational
approaches over the last three decades, all aimed at capturing the driving spatiotemporal scales
in these devices. Here, we mentioned only a few representative examples and cite some notable
results from the wide range of dynamic behaviors that has been captured by numerical simulations.
An in-depth synopsis of ongoing activities in this vibrant area of Hall thruster modeling is provided
by Kaganovich et al. [61] and the references therein.
A major challenge in the modeling of anomalous transport in Hall thrusters is that the discharge
is, in principle, three-dimensional (3-D) and, as already inferred in previous sections, the driving
physics span multiple scales. Moreover, it is now also widely accepted that deviations from the equi-
librium distribution function likely occur in the charged species, at least in some regions of the
thruster. This allows for the possibility of kinetic instabilities in the discharge. The solution for
the growth and saturation of such instabilities requires simulations that can follow the evolution
of the relevant velocity distributions functions. This can be very complex and computationally
expensive. Although computing processing power has been steadily increasing, kinetic simulations
with realistic parameters that span the entire Hall thruster domain remain quite challenging.
Although particle methods in 2-D (z-θ [84, 85, 115, 116] and r-θ [86, 117, 118]) and even in 3-D
[119, 120] have indeed been possible, they are limited to restricted spatial and/or temporal domains
and, therefore, are unable to account for all pertinent processes. To be more specific, simulations in
the z-θ plane can provide detailed insight into instabilities with wave vectors in the E × B and axial
directions but they provide no information about plasma-wall interactions. On the other hand, r-θ
simulations cannot account for the variation of the plasma properties in the axial direction and
therefore cannot capture how the transport physics evolve across the magnetic field in the different
regions of the channel.
Despite these limitations there has been considerable progress in our understanding of many
aspects of the Hall thruster discharge related to instabilities, especially in the vicinity of the accel-
eration region. For example, Adam and Héron [84, 86] reported strong evidence that the turbulence
generated by the electron cyclotron drift instability (ECDI) [121] is the cause of the anomalous elec-
tron transport in a Hall thruster. Their conclusions were based on the results of 2-D particle simu-
lations in the z-θ plane and on measurements [122–124]. Coche and Garrigues [85] also captured
ECDI-induced fluctuations in the azimuthal electric field, in the frequency range of MHz and wave
number of 3000 rad s−1 (seen in Fig. 7-29), from simulations with a different 2-D, z-θ particle code.
They reached conclusions similar to those by Adam, et al. Their simulations were also able to repro-
duce the breathing mode without the introduction of any additional anomalous processes. Further
insight was provided by the PIC simulations of Janhunen and Smolyakov [125] who found that for
finite values of the wave number (k) in the direction of B, the ECDI may transition to the Modified
Two-Stream Instability (MTSI) [126]. Simulations by Katz [115] in the z-θ plane have suggested that
ionization can also play a significant role, especially immediately downstream of the acceleration
region where both the plasma potential and electric field diminish. Growth of the MTSI and
another instability in the lower hybrid frequency range, the lower hybrid drift instability
(LHDI) [127, 128], also have been postulated to exist but in the near-plume region, between the
main ion beam and the thruster centerline [129, 130] with possible implications on the wear of
the front pole surfaces facing the plume [105].

7 Conventional Hall Thrusters

7.6
Operational Life of Conventional Hall Thrusters
The operating time and total impulse of a conventional Hall thruster is determined primarily by
erosion of the discharge channel wall and the life of the cathode. Hollow cathode wear-out has
not represented a life limitation to date because thruster lifetimes based on the discharge chamber
wall erosion of less than 10,000 h are typical, and robust LaB6 hollow cathodes have been used in all
the Russian Hall thrusters. Other issues such as deposited material build-up on the electrodes, con-
ductive-flake production, electrical shorting, etc. are also of concern in evaluating the life of a Hall
thruster. However, the erosion of the channel wall by ion bombardment sputtering is a very visible
process that changes the channel dimensions and ultimately exposes the magnetic circuit, which,
when eroded, can degrade the thruster performance. In addition, life tests of flight thrusters such as
the SPT-100 and the PPS-1350 show that it can take hundreds to thousands of hours for magnetic
circuit erosion to significantly alter the thruster performance. Of greater concern, in this case, is the
sputtering of iron from the magnetic circuit, which would have a significantly higher impact if
deposited on most spacecraft components. Therefore, understanding the wall erosion rate and
its dependence on thruster materials and operating parameters is of importance in predicting
the thruster life and performance over time and its potential impact on the spacecraft.
The erosion rate, given by the rate of change of the wall thickness “w”, is

where ji is the ion current density, W is the atomic weight, ρ is the material density, q is the ion
charge, Aυ is Avogadro’s Number, and Y(εi) is the sputtering yield of the material which is depend-
ent on the ion type and energy εi. Since the material properties are known, the issue becomes one of
knowing the ion flux, ion energy and sputtering yield of the wall.

7.6 Operational Life of Conventional Hall Thrusters

Several models of the Hall thruster have been developed and applied to this problem [41, 98, 131,
132]. The most accurate predictions have been achieved using 2-D codes such as HPHall and
Hall2de to obtain the ion fluxes and energies. The sputtering yield of boron nitride compounds used
in dielectric-wall Hall thrusters has been measured by Garnier [133] versus incidence angle and ion
energy, and is used in several of these models. However, the Garnier data is at only a few energies
and in excess of 300 V. Gamero [97] extrapolated this data to lower energies using the semi-
empirical sputtering law scaling of Yamamura and Tawara [134], obtaining the following expres-
sion for the sputtering yield in units of mm3/Coulomb:

7 6-2
where α is the incident angle of the ion on the surface. In Eq. 7.6-2, the value 58.6 represents the
estimated threshold energy for sputtering required by Yamamura’s model. Figure 7-30 shows an
example of the yield predicted by Eq. 7.6-2 for two different incidence angles. Equation 7.6-2
was shown to accurately fit the data of Garnier [133] and provides projections of the sputtering yield
down to low ion energies predicted by HPHall deeper in the channel.
Figure 7-31 shows the predicted [97] and experimentally measured erosion profiles [135] for the
SPT-100 thruster inner and outer channel walls. Reasonable agreement with the observed channel
erosion is seen near the thruster exit, and the profiles have the correct functional shape. It is likely
that inaccuracies in the extrapolated sputtering yield at low energies and plasma predictions by
HPHall caused the disagreement with the data deep in the channel.
Significant improvements to the erosion predictions by 2-D codes are illustrated by the recent use
of Hall2De’s modeling of the channel erosion to provide mission critical predictions of the thruster
throughput and life prediction for the SPT-140 Hall thruster. These thrusters will provide main pro-
pulsion for NASA’s mission to the asteroid Psyche for the heliocentric cruise from Earth [136] and,
once at the asteroid, they will also be used for orbit transfers and maintenance. The mission to Psy-
che will be the first ever to use Hall thrusters beyond cis-lunar space. In addition to validating
Hall2De simulations of the SPT-140 with data from plasma diagnostics, channel erosion measure-
ments from a wear test in a ground facility were also used to confirm the code’s simulations
under the same facility background pressure [113]. The comparisons with the measurements for

the SPT-140 are shown in Fig. 7-32 (bottom). Figure 7-32 (top) shows a photograph of a demonstra-
tion model of the SPT-140 showing the inner and outer channel rings [137]. The combination of
wear tests and simulations validated the thruster life for the larger power range and the mission
duration [138]. The simulations were also used in support of thruster performance modeling
and the determination of thruster swirl torque [139]. The latter was particularly important because
it drove the system and operation designs in ways that Earth-orbiting missions do not.
An area of continuing investigation in conventional Hall thruster erosion is the appearance of
scallops or striations on the eroded wall azimuthally around the axis of the thruster. Figure 7-33
shows the wall erosion observed around the channel in STP-100 [140] and PPS-1350 [141] wear
tests. Similar patterns were observed after the >10,400 h wear test of the BPT-4000 Hall thruster
[142]. Similar patterns with different scalloping period around the channel have also been observed
in other life tests. The cause of this structure is still unexplained.
It is possible to develop some simple scaling rules for conventional Hall thruster discharge wall
erosion in the magnetized plasma region near the exit plane. It was estimated in Section 7.3.4 above

that the ion flux to the wall in dielectric-wall Hall thrusters was about 10% of the beam current. It
can be assumed that the energy of the ion flux to the wall is related to the beam energy, which is
proportional to the discharge voltage. An examination of Fig. 7-30 shows that the sputtering yield
above threshold is essentially a linear function of the ion energy. The erosion rate in Eq. 7.6-1 then
becomes
K Ib
Aw
Vd = K IdVd
ηbAw
,
7 6-3
where K is a constant, Aw is the wall area and Eq. 7.3-10 has been used for the beam current effi-
ciency. Equation 7.6-3 shows that the erosion rate of the thruster wall is proportional to the power
density in the accelerator channel [5]. This indicates that larger Hall thrusters are required to
increase the power for a given operation time as determined by the allowable erosion of the insu-
lator wall thickness. A good rule-of-thumb for the relationship of operation-time over a reasonable
throttle range of a given Hall thruster design is
Power × Operation Time ≈constant
Over a limited range, the thrust from a Hall thruster is proportional to the discharge power, and so
Thrust × Operation Time ≈constant
This suggests that the total impulse is essentially a constant for a given thruster design. Therefore,
operating at lower thrust in throttled mission profiles will result in longer thruster operation time.
However, if the throttling is too deep, the thruster performance will degrade (requiring higher input
power to produce a given thrust) and the relationship above is no longer valid. Hall thruster throttle
ranges of over 10:1 have been demonstrated with good performance, depending on the thruster
design.

7.6 Operational Life of Conventional Hall Thrusters

Finally, the life of TAL thrusters has not been as extensively investigated as the Russian SPT
thrusters. The erosion of the channel guard rings has been attributed to be the primary life limiting
mechanism [35], and alternative materials were suggested to extend the thruster life by reducing
the sputtering yield. Since the wall/guard-ring is biased at cathode potential, the incident ion
energy along the wall depends on the potential profile in the thruster channel and past the exit
plane. This certainly influenced the selection of the TAL anode placement and the design of the
anode/channel region to minimize the ion energy (and flux) to the walls. The dielectric-wall Hall
thrusters limited the ion energy to the floating potential (≈6Te for xenon) for wall materials with
very low secondary electron yield, and to lower energies with materials that have secondary elec-
tron yields approaching or exceeding one at the electron temperatures of typical operation. The
sheath potential at the wall is likely on the order of 3Te ≈0.3Vd because of space charge and
non-Maxwellian electron distribution function effects. However, the lower sheath potential at
the wall increases the electron flux, which results in increased power loading at the wall.
The wall material selection, therefore, is a tradeoff between efficiency and life. Dielectric walls
reduce the bombarding ion energy of the wall at the expense of higher electron fluxes and higher
power loading. Metallic-wall Hall thrusters have higher ion energies to the wall and therefore sput-
ter-erosion life issues, and so they have to compensate with geometry changes to obtain the desired
life. This results in higher heat fluxes to the anode, which dominates the TAL efficiency. An
increase in the power of both types of thrusters also requires increases in the thruster size to obtain
the same or longer lifetimes. Therefore, Hall thruster design, like ion thruster design, is a tradeoff
between performance and life.

perature is 25 eV? (hint: write the ion production rate in terms of the Hall current and use
Appendix E for ionization and excitation collision cross sections).
b) For a xenon ion thruster with a mean radius of 9 cm, a radial magnetic field of 150 G and a
discharge voltage of 300 V, what is the ratio of the Hall current to the beam current?
7.6
A xenon Hall thruster has a channel outside diameter of 10 cm and a channel width of 3.5 cm
with BNSiO2 walls. Assume a plasma density of 2 × 1017 m−3 and an electron temperature of
20 eV in the channel with the majority of the plasma in contact with 1 cm of the wall axially.
a) What is the electron current to the wall?
b) What is the net electron current to the wall?
c) What is the power deposited on the wall associated with this electron current?
d) What is the power deposited on the wall associated with ion current?
7.7
Assume that the thruster in Problem 7.6 has alumina walls and produces 3.5 A of beam cur-
rent at 400 V with an electron temperature in the channel of 15 eV. The thruster also has a
beam current utilization efficiency ηb = 0.5.
a) What is the power into the discharge?
b) What is the total power into the alumina walls for a contact length of L-2 cm?
c) Assuming that the electron temperature at the anode is 5 eV, the mass utilization effi-
ciency is 90% and the thrust correction factor γ = 0.9, and neglecting all other power loss
channels, what is the thruster efficiency?
d) For a beam voltage utilization efficiency of 0.9, how much thrust and Isp is produced?
7.8
The electron current to the anode in a Hall thruster can be estimated from the perpendicular
electron flux diffusing through the plasma channel.
a) Neglecting the pressure gradient terms, derive an expression for the current to the anode
in terms of the collision frequency in the channel plasma.
b) For the thruster in Problem 7.7 with a transverse magnetic field of 150 G and an axial elec-
tric field of 3 × 04 V/m, what is the transverse electron current if only classic electron-ion
collisions are considered?
c) The effective wall collision frequency can be estimated as the electron current to the wall
times the secondary electron yield and divided by the total number of particles in the
plasma (νw = γIew/N, where N is approximately the plasma density times the channel cross
sectional area times the plasma length L). Derive an expression for the anode current
because of the electron-wall collisions in terms of the electron current to the wall.

d) What is the total transverse electron current for this thruster example using L = 2 cm for
the bulk of the plasma density?

on the wall material?

Calculate the power lost to the wall in a xenon TAL thruster with stainless steel walls that
has a plasma density at the sheath edge of 2 × 1017 m−3 and an electron temperature of 20 eV.
The channel is 12 cm outside diameter, 8 cm inside diameter and 0.5 cm long. Which power
loss channel (ions or electrons) is larger?
7.10
The life of a TAL thruster is limited primarily by the ion sputtering of the metallic guard
rings next to the thruster exit. Assume a TAL has a plasma density near the wall of
1017m−3 and an electron temperature of 25 eV.
a) For stainless steel walls, what is the ion current density to the walls (the guard rings) and
the sheath potential?
b) Assuming that the stainless-steel sputtering yield is about 0.1 atoms per incident ion at
the sheath voltage found in (a), what is the life in hours of the TAL if 2 mm thickness of
the stainless-steel guard ring material can be eroded away?
c) Assume that the wall material has been changed to graphite with a secondary electron
yield of about 0.5. What is the sheath potential at the wall?
d) Assuming that the graphite sputtering yield is about 5 × 10−3 atoms per incident ion at
the sheath voltage found in (c), what is the life in hours of the TAL if 1 mm thickness of

Magnetically Shielded Hall Thrusters
8.1
Introduction
Erosion of the discharge chamber in Hall thrusters can expose its magnetic circuit to bombardment
by energetic beam ions, which may lead to the failure of the engine. This was recognized as a poten-
tial limitation of Hall thrusters early in their history. Although propulsive performance dominated
their development at that time, techniques to reduce or eliminate channel erosion were considered
as early as the 1960s. In an extensive review of stationary plasma thrusters (SPT), Morozov and
Savelyev stated [1]: … at the beginning of the 1960s magnetic force line equipotentialization became
known, and the chosen geometry of force lines (convex toward the anode) provided repulsion of ions
from the walls by the electric field, thus reducing the channel erosion. Many advancements in the
applied magnetic field design followed those early efforts, eventually leading to improvements
in both thruster performance and wear (e.g. see [2–5]). However, channel erosion was never under-
stood well enough to eliminate it or reduce it adequately to achieve the required thruster lifetime
and retire the risk for deep-space science missions. It has been largely due to this risk that, as of the
writing of this book, Hall thrusters have not yet flown beyond lunar orbit despite their enabling
propulsive capabilities and demonstrated performance in Earth-orbiting station keeping and orbit
raising applications.
In contrast to gridded ion thrusters in which the ion beam can be well controlled with the proper
arrangement of the electrode apertures, the focusing of unmagnetized ions away from the discharge
chamber walls in gridless devices like the Hall thruster is significantly more challenging. This is
mainly because the induced electric field must conform to the generalized Ohm’s Law. In conven-
tional Hall thrusters, this allows for deviations from “magnetic force line equipotentialization” due
to the finite electron pressure. Such deviations increase with higher electron temperature and can
occur not only inside the sheath that forms near the channel walls, but also in the pre-sheath and in
the plasma. Therefore, a component of the electric field along the applied magnetic field can be, and
usually is, established that accelerates some high energy beam ions toward the walls causing
sputtering.
As a result of this breakdown in the orthogonality of the electric and magnetic fields, a topology of
magnetic field lines with convex curvature toward the anode cannot effectively control the electric
field near surfaces if the near-wall lines are not also truly equipotential. This is true even in the more
advanced “plasma lens” configurations that evolved from the older SPT-like designs. Morozov had
proposed that, alternatively, such equipotentialization may be achieved either by virtue of the inter-
nal conductivity of the channel or through the use of special anular electrode holders [6]. Although

unconventional electrode arrangements can indeed alter the relevant plasma properties favorably
(e.g. see [7]), no thruster design with or without atypical electrode configurations had demonstrated
zero or near-zero channel erosion throughout the entirety of long wear or life tests. Since the incep-
tion of Hall thrusters over 60 years ago and through the early 2000s, efforts to eliminate channel
erosion remained unsuccessful [8].
Around 2010, a new technique to protect the channel from ion bombardment was discovered. In
doing so, wall erosion was eliminated as the primary failure mode of Hall thrusters, which extended
their applicability to space missions far beyond lunar orbit. The events that led to the solution of this
longstanding problem in Hall thrusters was a fortuitous combination of an unforeseen laboratory
test result and the theoretical investigations that ensued to explain it [9] – a combination that is not
at all uncommon in science and engineering breakthroughs. Ultimately, the basic principles of the
technique were the outcome of theoretical arguments and physics-based numerical simulations
[9, 10]. However, the significance of the laboratory tests that preceded [11] and followed [12] such
derivations cannot be understated, for they instigated and ultimately validated the theory on which
the technique is founded.
Termed magnetic shielding [10], the fundamental impetus behind this wall-erosion elimination
technique is the achievement of near-ideal equipotentialization of the lines of force near the walls
without the use of additional electrodes. By considering the isothermal properties of the magnetic
field lines in these thrusters, it was recognized that this can be accomplished by a magnetic field
topology that extends field lines adjacent to the walls deep into the anode region where plasma
electrons are cold (~1–3 eV) [9, 10]. In doing so, not only is the contribution of the electron pressure
to the parallel electric field marginalized, but the energy that ions can gain through the sheath is
limited significantly. This ideal equipotentialization then allows for a near-total control of the elec-
tric field near the walls by the applied magnetic field because it preserves closely the orthogonality
between them.
Magnetic shielding can increase the propellant throughput capability of Hall thrusters by at least
tenfold for a wide range of power levels and thruster sizes. It has, therefore, revolutionized the way
these devices are designed worldwide. Since 2010, there have been programs developing and inves-
tigating magnetically shielded Hall thrusters in several countries including France [13, 14], Italy
[15, 16], China [17, 18], India [19], and Japan [20]. In the United States, there have been several
R&D programs involving thrusters across a wide range of discharge powers, from 20 kW [21] down
to the sub-kW level [22, 23]. One of the longest programs has been the development of the 600-V,
12.5-kW Hall Effect Rocket with Magnetic Shielding (HERMeS) [24], which began at NASA in 2012
and ultimately led to partnerships with the private sector where the thruster technology HERMeS
was incorporated into the Advanced Electric Propulsion System (AEPS) [25]. The HERMeS pro-
gram has produced an extensive body of experimental [26–28] and theoretical work [29–33]
(and references therein) on magnetic shielding. The first flight of this technology is planned for
2025 on the Power and Propulsion Element of the lunar outpost Gateway, a part of NASA’s Artemis
program [34].
8.2
First Principles of Magnetic Shielding
We begin this section by revisiting a few elementary physics of Hall thrusters from Chapter 7 that
will prove critical in magnetic shielding. A schematic illustrating the basic features of the device is
shown in Fig. 8-1a. The beam is produced by the formation of an azimuthal electron current that
338
8 Magnetically Shielded Hall Thrusters

interacts with an applied radial magnetic flux density B to produce a largely axial force on the ions.
The electron number density (ne) is low enough that classical collisions in the azimuthal direction
seldom impede their E × B drift, inducing a Hall current. Operation under these conditions implies
a high Hall parameter for the electrons, Ωe ≡ωc/νm >> 1, where ωc and νm are the electron cyclotron
and total momentum-transfer collision frequencies, respectively. As the Hall current crosses B, the
induced electric field E is in the direction perpendicular (⊥) to B and proportional to ~ ηΩ2
eje⊥where
the electron current density and resistivity have been denoted by je and η, respectively. qiE⊥serves
as the main force on the ions where qi is the ion charge. Also, ∂B/∂t = 0 thus E = −∇ϕ, with ϕ being
the plasma potential. The increased resistive heating of electrons in the region of high E also leads
to an increase in the electron temperature, Te. Typical ϕ and Te profiles along the channel centerline
are sketched in Fig. 8-1a.
Under these discharge conditions the resistance to the electron transport of heat and mass
parallel (||) to B is much smaller (by ~Ωe
2) than that in the ⊥direction. In the limit Ωe ➔∞, Te
is constant along the magnetic field lines
∇Te = 0
8 2-1
and the electron momentum equation simplifies to
E = −Te∇ln ne
8 2-2
Equations 8.2-1 and 8.2-2 yield two well-known conditions along lines of force: Te = TeR and ϕ = ϕR
+ Te ln(ne/neR) where TeR, ϕR and neR are constants of integration. Hence, although each line is
isothermal it is not also equipotential, that is, E
0.
Erosion of the channel walls occurs when ions bombard them with sufficient energy to sputter off
material. The erosion rate is proportional to the product of the incident ion flux and the sputtering
yield of the material. The latter is a strong function of the total ion energy, which consists of
energy gains made in the plasma and those made inside the sheath. Henceforth, we shall use
the terms “kinetic” and “sheath” to distinguish between the two energy contributions. For dielec-
tric materials, the electric potential drop in the sheath is dependent on the electron temperature

[35]. In these sheaths, higher Te typically implies higher sheath drop. A few representative B-lines
in an SPT-like thruster channel are illustrated in Fig. 8-1b. In this configuration, the variation of ϕ
and Te near the walls is similar to that along the centerline because the lines are nearly radial. Con-
sequently, the higher E and Te there can produce a flux of high-energy ions toward the material.
For reasons that will become apparent shortly we designate this arrangement of channel geometry
and magnetic field as an “unshielded (US)” configuration.
The above arguments then imply that if a magnetic field can by constructed such that Te
0 and
ϕ
Vd near the channel walls, with Vd being the discharge voltage, the kinetic and sheath energies
of an incident ion can be marginalized. Moreover, if the channel geometry relative to B is designed
properly, E can be controlled to be both nearly perpendicular to the surface and large in magnitude,
thereby accelerating ions away from walls and without loss of propulsive performance. This also
reduces the wall-incident ion flux. A schematic of the arrangement that accomplishes all the above
– hereinafter termed a magnetically shielded configuration – is depicted in Fig. 8-1c. The key prin-
ciple behind magnetic shielding lies in the recognition that the electron pressure (right hand side
of Eq. 8.2-2) forces E and B to no longer form an orthogonal set (Fig. 8-1b). Thus, a geometry of
B-lines with convex curvature toward the anode (first proposed by Morozov [1] and references
therein) cannot effectively control E near surfaces (and, in turn, the erosion) if the near-wall lines
are not also truly equipotential. By contrast, the magnetically shielded configuration in Fig. 8-1c
eliminates the contribution of the electron pressure by exploiting those B-lines that extend to
the anode. Because these lines are associated with high ϕR and low TeR the contribution of Te ln
(ne) is marginalized.
8.3
The Protective Capabilities of Magnetic Shielding
The theoretical underpinnings of magnetic shielding were first derived by Mikellides et al. [9, 10]
based on the insight revealed by 2-D numerical simulations of a commercial Hall thruster [9]. These
were followed by additional simulations [36] and dedicated experiments [12] that validated the the-
ory and demonstrated in the laboratory the predicted reductions of the erosion rates along the chan-
nel walls. We outline in this section some of the more salient parts of that work for the purpose of
expanding further on the first principles of the technique, and for illustrating more quantitatively
the protection it provides against ion sputtering.
8.3.1
Numerical Simulations
The first numerical simulations of magnetic shielding were performed with the 2-D axisymmetric
code Hall2De developed by Mikellides and Katz at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory [37, 38]. The simu-
lations were undertaken to explain never-before-seen erosion trends observed in a qualification life
test (QLT) of a commercial Hall thruster [9, 11]. Specifically, the channel walls eroded in the begin-
ning of the QLT at rates that are typical of other conventional (or “unshielded”) thrusters but then,
after about 5600 h, the walls reached a “zero-erosion” state. The test result was unprecedented and
potentially very significant, but it also lacked a physics-based explanation. Therefore, the possibility
that facility effects or other inconsequential processes were behind the observed wear trend could
not be excluded. It was later shown by Hall2De simulations [36] and validation experiments [12],
that the physics that led to this outcome were complex enough that they could not have been pre-
dicted by previous models or basic thruster design tools.
340
8 Magnetically Shielded Hall Thrusters

Hall2De was the only code during that time that solved an extensive system of equations govern-
ing the physics of Hall thrusters with complex magnetic field topologies near solid boundaries. It
was, therefore, uniquely suited to elucidate the QLT result. The simulations revealed that as por-
tions of the magnetic field slowly became exposed to the discharge by the recession of the channel
material, several changes were triggered in the local plasma that led to the formation of an effective
“shielding” of the channel walls from ion bombardment. Because all these changes were found to
be driven by the magnitude and topology of the magnetic field there, the authors termed this wear-
reducing mechanism “magnetic shielding” [9].
The significance of these findings prompted a focused proof-of-principle experimental investiga-
tion shortly thereafter, which established and validated the protective capabilities of magnetic
shielding. The effort involved the modification of the channel geometry and magnetic field of
an existing thruster, a 6-kW laboratory Hall thruster called the H6, to yield a magnetically shielded
variant dubbed the H6MS. A main objective of the campaign was to show that much lower erosion
rates could be achieved by the H6MS compared to the original, unshielded, version of the thruster,
which was called the H6US. But it was also recognized that lower erosion rates alone would not be
sufficient to demonstrate unambiguously that magnetic shielding was achieved in the laboratory.
Proof of the magnetic shielding physics that actually led to the wear reductions would have to be
established as well. Therefore, thruster testing was accompanied by a wide range of plasma and
erosion diagnostics to allow for one-on-one comparisons with the plasma simulations by Hall2De.
Representative results from Hall2De simulations in the vicinity of the acceleration channel are
compared in the H6US and H6MS configurations in Fig. 8-2. Comparisons that are pertinent to wall
erosion also are plotted in Fig. 8-3. The effect of magnetic shielding on the plasma potential is
evident in Fig. 8-2-top. Only a 4–15 V reduction was computed along the magnetically shielded
diverging walls compared to a drop that was as high as 230 V along the unshielded inner wall near
the channel exit. The kinetic energy of the ions was therefore reduced significantly in the magnetic
shielding configuration as shown in Fig. 8-3a. If B-lines are isothermal then the lines that graze the
corner formed by the cylindrical and diverging sections of the magnetically shielded channel must
also be associated with low Te because they extend deep into the acceleration channel where the
electrons are cold (Fig. 8-1-right). Because of their critical role in magnetic shielding, these special
lines of force in the overall magnetic field topology of the thruster are termed the “grazing lines”
[9, 10]. Indeed, the comparison of the two configurations in Fig. 8-2-middle shows a significant
reduction of Te in these highly shielded regions of the walls. Because Te is reduced, a decrease
of the sheath fall is also achieved. In the downstream ~20% of the channel a reduction in the sheath
energy of about 4–10 times that in the unshielded configuration (Fig. 8-3b) was computed. Finally,
because E|| is practically eliminated near the walls of the magnetically shielded thruster, ion accel-
eration occurs mostly away from the walls. This leads to lower wall incident ion flux. Referring to
Fig. 8-3c, the perpendicular component of the Xe+ ion current density (Ji⊥) near the channel exit
was found to be 7.7 and 49.1 times lower at the magnetically shielded outer and inner walls, respec-
tively. In regions where the magnetically shielded fluxes begin to become comparable to the
unshielded fluxes, the ion energy was found to be below the energy threshold for sputtering. In
fact, the total ion energy at the H6MS outer wall is below the threshold (25 V) for sputtering along
the entire outer wall, and thus zero erosion was found.
8.3.2
Laboratory Experiments and Model Validation
The two H6 thruster configurations (with and without magnetic shielding) were operated with
xenon at discharge voltage and power of 300 V and 6 kW, respectively, to assess the effect of

magnetic shielding on the channel wall erosion. The channel walls in both these thruster config-
urations were made of boron nitride. Sixteen different diagnostics were employed in the first proof-
of-principle magnetic shielding experiments with the H6 Hall thruster [12]. These diagnostics are
listed in Table 8-1 to illustrate all of the parameters that needed to be measured or determined to
validate the physics of magnetic shielding described by the simulations. The most revealing results
were likely those from flush-mounted probes imbedded in the channel walls. The objective with
these probes was to measure the plasma properties near the magnetically shielded walls and com-
pare them with those from the unshielded version of the thruster. Profilometry measurements of
the channel erosion were also critical to demonstrate the erosion reductions. We summarize in this
section some of these measurements and discuss their significance in the validation of the magnetic
shielding theory.

To measure the plasma parameters at the dis-
charge chamber wall in the acceleration region,
an array of flat tungsten probes was embedded
in the inner and outer rings of the H6MS, as
shown in Fig. 8-4. The H6US was also outfitted
with these probes to allow for direct compari-
sons with the H6MS and the simulations.
A representative set of comparisons between
computed and simulated values of ϕ at the
inner wall (top) and Te at the outer wall (bot-
tom) is shown in Fig. 8-5. The full set of probe
results at both walls is reported in [36]. These
comparisons confirmed the magnetic shielding
theory outlined in the previous sections. Specif-
ically, the plasma potential ϕ was found to be
nearly constant along the magnetically shielded
walls and near the anode potential, in contrast
to a decrease in the H6US configuration by more than 150 V. The electron temperature in the
magnetically shielded thruster remained at near-anode values along the wall in the accelera-
tion region. Of particular importance is the agreement at the z/Lc location where the plasma
potential begins to decrease appreciably from the discharge voltage since in the unshielded
configurations it is beyond this point that ions near the walls begin to acquire significant
kinetic energy. This is also the region where ions can gain additional energy from the sheath,
as suggested by the rise of Te in this location (Fig. 8-5-bottom). Hence, it was expected that this
region of the walls would exhibit the highest erosion rates. Indeed, visual inspection of the
channel rings after the thruster was tested in a vacuum facility confirmed this expectation
[12]. A photograph of the H6US inner ring after 28 h of operation is provided in Fig. 8-7-left.
The photograph shows clearly a texturing of the wall material, which was caused by the
impingement of high-energy ions on the surface. Along this “erosion band” the wear rate
was found to exceed the carbon deposition rate from the vacuum facility. It is worthwhile
noting that the extent of the band was measured to be z/Lc ≈0.1. This length scale is in-
agreement with the profiles of Fig. 8-3 where the ion energy gains were found to exceed
the sputtering yield energy threshold. This threshold was estimated to be in the range of
25–50 V [36] for the H6 channel material. The visual observation of the erosion zone was also
found to be consistent with profilometry measurements of the erosion, as will be shown later in
this section.
The observed trends in Te were found to be in agreement with the theoretical predictions of a low
electron temperature along the discharge chamber wall as well (Fig. 8-5 bottom). The electron tem-
perature was measured to be about ~2.5–3 times lower along the H6MS walls compared to those in
the H6US. Another prediction from the simulations confirmed by these experiments was that the
location of the acceleration region should move slightly downstream in the magnetically shielded
configuration. This was first validated by utilizing fast scanning probe measurements of the axial
potential and electron temperature profiles on the discharge channel centerline [12] plotted in
Fig. 8-6. The plasma potential data was obtained using an emissive probe, and the electron temper-
ature data was from a Langmuir probe installed on the scanning probe tip. The electron tempera-
tures are observed to be higher in the magnetically shielded configuration. Both the plasma

potential profile and the location of the peak electron temperature show that the acceleration
region in the magnetic shielding case shifted downstream by some fraction of a centimeter. Sub-
sequent non-intrusive measurements of the potential profile by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF)
confirmed this plasma movement trend [39], and showed that the acceleration region was located
2- 3 mm downstream of the location suggested by the probe data due to perturbation of the plasma
position by the probe [40].
Inspection of the H6MS rings after operation of the thruster for tens of hours supported the con-
clusion that the low temperatures and constant potential along the discharge chamber wall results
in low erosion rates. A photograph of the inner magnetically shielded wall after 19 h of operation is
provided in Fig. 8-7-right and shows clearly that the region of net carbon deposition spanned the
entire wall, including the chamfer. To demonstrate the significance of the magnetic field topology

in magnetic shielding, a different experiment was conducted in which the H6MS rings were used
but with the magnetic field topology of the H6US. A photograph of the inner wall after completion
of a 10-h test is shown in Fig. 8-7-middle. Clearly visible is the same “erosion band” that was
observed in the H6US in Fig. 8-7-left with the same spatial extent of ~0.1Lc.
All theoretical and experimental evidence discussed thus far indicates that channel erosion
should have been found to be significantly reduced in the H6MS configuration after the wear test.
Indeed, profilometry ultimately confirmed this expectation [12]. The erosion measurements were
conducted using a coordinate measuring machine (CMM). The deposition rate of back-sputtered
carbon was also monitored during hot-fire testing using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) that
was mounted adjacent to the thruster. Erosion rates from the simulations are compared in Fig. 8-8
with net rates measured by the CMM. The latter were determined by averaging CMM measure-
ments taken at four circumferential locations around the rings [12]. Two simulation results are
plotted that correspond to different sputtering yield models: one with threshold ion energy EK = 25
V and the other with EK = 50 V. For the H6MS only the first model (EK = 25 V) yields a non-zero
erosion rate at the inner wall; at the outer wall, the computed rate is zero because the impact energy
of ions is found to be less than EK. The chamfered walls in the H6MS span 0.72 ≲z/Lc ≤1. The
measurements in Fig. 8-8 were obtained after the two thruster configurations were operated for

the carbon deposition rate (−0.004 ± 0.001 mm/kh) measured by the QCM. Negative and positive
values indicate net deposition and net erosion, respectively.
Based only on the wall probe plasma data and an intermediate sputtering yield model with
EK = 30.5 V (that is, between the two used in the simulations), the erosion rate was found to be
at least ~1000 times (±60%) lower at the H6MS inner wall compared to the highest value in the
H6US. At the outer wall the ion energy was below EK. This is consistent with the simulations which
predicted a reduction of ~600 times at the magnetic shielding inner wall and ion energies below EK
at the outer wall (Fig. 8-3d). Collectively, the results from the numerical simulations and the experi-
ments agreed that the erosion was reduced in the magnetic shielding configuration by at least 2–3
orders of magnitude. The photographs of the magnetically shielded thruster taken before and after
the test show that the walls are fully coated with carbon after operation, as shown in Fig. 8-9-right,
which has now become one of the most widely recognized symptoms of magnetically shielded Hall
thrusters after testing in laboratory facilities. However, coated walls are not in and of themselves
sufficient evidence of magnetic shielding because facilities with very high carbon backsputter rates
will coat even unshielded thruster walls. Additional diagnostics tests as described above are
required to fully validate that magnetic shielding has been achieved.
The ability of magnetic shielding to protect the discharge chamber from ion sputtering would, of
course, not be very meaningful if the technique also degraded thruster performance in any conse-
quential way. One of the major contributions of these first proof-of-principle experiments was that
they demonstrated both near erosion–free operation and high thruster performance. The total effi-
ciency decreased by only 1.7% whereas specific impulse increased by 2.9% compared to the
unshielded thruster performance. The thrust decrease was found to be due to plume divergence
angle increases in the magnetically shielded configuration due to the field shape and the movement
of the plasma downstream. The specific impulse increase was found to be due to a larger amount of
higher ionized ions in the plume, which increase the ion velocity and therefore the specific impulse.

The thermal camera diagnostic showed that the temperatures of the insulator rings were reduced by
12–16%, indicating the potential for higher power operation without overheating the thruster com-
ponents. Discharge current oscillations, while increasing 25%, did not affect the global stability of
the discharge [12]. Magnetically shielded thrusters developed and tested later also showed high per-
formance for a wide range of operating conditions and thruster sizes [41–43].
8.4
Magnetically Shielded Hall Thrusters with Electrically
Conducting Walls
The experiments described above showed that magnetic shielding significantly reduces the plasma
interactions with the discharge chamber walls and that, when properly designed, these thrusters
tend to build up carbon layers on the boron nitride insulators during operation in ground test facil-
ities. The experiments demonstrated that the thruster performance was not significantly affected by
the presence of a somewhat resistive surface on the discharge chamber walls in contact with the
plasma due to the thin carbon deposition layer. This suggests that the use of ceramic walls is
not needed in magnetically shielded Hall thrusters [44].
The ceramic walls in conventional unshielded Hall thrusters are there to provide three main
features:
1) Insulating surfaces to avoid shorting out the axial ion-accelerating electric field in the thruster
acceleration region,
2) Low sputtering yield to minimize the erosion and extend thruster life,
3) Low secondary electron yield to minimize the electron power loss to the wall
Conventional Hall thrusters that used wall materials other than boron nitride, such as higher
secondary electron yield ceramics (Al2O3, SiC, Macor, quartz, etc.), or conductors (graphite, car-
bon velvet, stainless steel, etc.) [45–48] are significantly less efficient and are predicted to have
shorter life times and lower throughput capabilities. The poorer performance of these thrusters
using alternative materials has been largely attributed to the higher secondary yield [45, 49–51] or
higher conductivity of these materials compared to the now standard boron nitride or borosili-
cate walls.
Magnetic shielding thus opens the design space on the discharge chamber in a Hall thruster.
Making the discharge chamber from electrically conducting materials simplifies the construction
of the thruster that is required to withstand launch vibrations by eliminating large, fragile ceramics
and their mechanical supports. Reducing support structure and utilizing lightweight materials such
as graphite will also lead to significant reductions in the thruster mass and cost. Conducting wall
designs could also lead to factors of two to three increase in the thruster power density due to the
lower power loading on the discharge chamber walls and the use of higher emissivity surfaces to
radiate that power away. Fig. 8-10 shows a photograph of the H6 thruster modified to have graphite
walls in the discharge chamber in contact with the plasma in the acceleration region.
The first experiments with conducting walls in a magnetically shielded Hall thruster were per-
formed by Goebel et al. [44] who showed that the performance was not significantly affected by the
use of graphite walls, in stark contrast to that found in unshielded Hall thrusters. A comparison is
shown in Fig. 8-11, which plots the thrust and efficiency measured on the H6 thruster at 300 V and
20 A of current (6 kW of power) with the three different wall configurations (unshielded,
magnetically shielded with boron nitride walls, magnetically shielded with graphite walls as shown

design parameter in Hall thrusters). The plot shows clearly that the magnetically shielded thruster
has nearly the same efficiency as the baseline unshielded thruster (within 2%), but the thrust is
reduced slightly.
The experiments also showed that graphite wall Hall thrusters can operate at a higher power than
one with BN walls. Figure 8-12 shows the temperatures of the inner and outer rings (the discharge
chamber wall on the downstream end in the H6) for the three configurations (unshielded with BN
wall, magnetically shielded with BN walls, and magnetically shielded with graphite walls)
described above. The circular data points show that the graphite surfaces are 100-to-200 C lower
than the BN walls at the same power level. The lower wall temperatures are roughly half because of
lower heat fluxes in the magnetically shielded configuration, and half because of the higher emis-
sivity graphite wall material. Higher power thrusters, or more compact Hall thrusters, can then be
made using this configuration. Since this original work, conducting wall Hall thruster operation
has been extended by Hofer [52] to 800 V at over 12 kW in the H9MS at JPL, demonstrating reliable
operation at 3000 s specific impulse. Conducting wall Hall thrusters have also been investigated in
France [13, 53] and China [54], and work continues on this advancement in Hall thruster design
elsewhere in the world.

Magnetic Shielding in Low Power Hall Thrusters
Conventional unshielded low-power (sub-kW) Hall thrusters typically have lower efficiencies (less
than 50%) and shorter lifetimes (on the order of a few thousand hours) compared to the state-of-the-
art Hall thrusters designed for operation in excess of about 1.5 kW. This is largely because of the
inherent problem of scaling Hall thrusters to smaller sizes where the surface-to-volume ratio
decreases considerably. Since favorable processes like ionization and acceleration occur in the vol-
ume of the plasma, and unfavorable processes like particle losses and power deposition occur at the

surface of the plasma, smaller Hall thrusters with lower surface-to-volume ratios tend to show
lower performance and shorter life. In addition, small Hall thrusters tend to have externally
mounted hollow cathodes because of a lack of space on axis to insert a centrally-mounted cathode.
Externally mounted cathodes have been shown to reduce the efficiency of the thruster [55, 56] and
create significant sensitivity to positioning (relative to the thruster’s discharge channel) and back-
ground pressure.
Magnetic shielding has been found to mitigate both the performance and life issues in low
power Hall thrusters. As expected, the erosion of the discharge chamber wall in low power Hall
thrusters with magnetic shielding was found to be reduced by orders of magnitude compared to
conventional unshielded thrusters. In addition to this longer life, the MaSMi (Magnetically
Shielded Miniature) Hall thruster was originally developed by Conversano [57] to also demon-
strate the higher performance and efficiency afforded by magnetic shielding in a sub-kilowatt
Hall thruster.
A photograph of the 12-cm-O.D. MaSMi Hall thruster is shown in Fig. 8-13. The thruster uses an
additively manufactured (3D printed) Hiperco magnetic circuit to produce the field shape and
intensity needed for magnetic shielding. To simplify the PPU to a single magnet power supply,
the inner and outer magnet coils are connected in series internally. The magnetic circuit was
designed to minimize shifts in the magnetic field topology across the accessible range of magnetic
field strengths. Testing across the full range of magnetic field settings demonstrated that the field
profile remained centered in the channel and any small shifts did not significantly alter the thruster
behavior. The discharge chamber is fabricated from a high strength blended ceramic material that
features exceptional mechanical and thermal shock resistance and essentially no water or air
uptake behavior when the thruster is in atmosphere. Therefore, the thruster performance is stable
immediately after turn on following extended periods of exposure to air (no outgassing required).
Further, the performance and behavior of the MaSMi thruster were demonstrated to be invariant
over life [58].
Figure 8-14 shows the thrust, Isp, and total efficiency of the MaSMi thruster as a function of
power [43]. At 1.35 kW and 300 V, equivalent to the nominal operating point of the SPT-100
Hall thruster, the MaSMi thruster produced
94.5 mN of thrust at a specific impulse of 1800
s and a total efficiency of 60.3%. Each of these
values is nearly 20% higher than those produced
by the SPT-100 at this operating point [59],

corresponding increases in throughput and total
impulse capability. This life capability greatly
exceeds that achieved in unshielded low-power
Hall thrusters.

Final Remarks on Magnetic Shielding in Hall Thrusters
During the early development of the principles of magnetic shielding, misconceptions emerged,
which is not uncommon when a solution to a very longstanding problem is found. Now, more than
a decade after the first papers on magnetic shielding were published, most of these misconceptions

have been elucidated in the peer reviewed literature, but it is useful to discuss a few of them here in
this final section of the chapter.
Due to its electrode configuration, a magnetically shielded Hall thruster is distinctly
different from the so-called “Thruster with Anode Layer” (TAL). (Chapter. 7.1.2, [60]).
The discharge chamber walls in a TAL are metallic and are typically biased to the cathode
potential in order to minimize electron energy losses. In a magnetically shielded Hall
thruster with a conventional channel, the insulating walls tend to float near the anode
potential because the ion and electron fluxes on these surfaces must be equal. In conducting
wall Hall thrusters, magnetic shielding isolates the walls sufficiently from the plasma to
eliminate this requirement for equal ion and electron fluxes, and the walls tend to float near
the anode potential because they are in contact with magnetic field lines that contain cold
electrons (Te ➔0) from the anode region. Ions reaching the wall of a TAL can attain nearly
the entire applied discharge voltage, which results in erosion rates that are of the same order
as unshielded Hall thrusters. In a magnetically shielded thruster, the ion energy is only a few
volts, which results in orders of magnitude lower erosion rates than either an unshielded
Hall thruster or a TAL.
Magnetic shielding is also markedly different from other techniques that have been pursued to
protect surfaces from erosion, like in the Highly Efficient Multistage Plasma Thruster (HEMP-T)
[61] and the Diverging Cusped Field Thruster (DCFT) [62]. These configurations exploit the mag-
netic mirror effect on electrons by employing multi-cusped magnetic fields to reduce plasma bom-
bardment of the walls at the cusps. Such cusped arrangements also provide the magnetic field
direction needed to induce the azimuthal electron motion and, in turn, the accelerating electric
field at the cusped regions. In Hall thrusters with magnetic shielding, there is no magnetic mirror
effect because there are no cusps.
Finally, in the first proof-of-principle laboratory experiments of magnetic shielding with the
H6 (described in Section 8.3.2), no channel erosion was observed but the surface of the front
poles facing the near-plume plasma of the thruster appeared eroded after only 150 h of wear
testing [63, 64]. Such erosion of the front poles had not been observed in unshielded Hall thrus-
ters. To achieve magnetic shielding, the magnetic field must be applied in a manner in which
the location of the peak field flux density is slightly downstream of that in an equivalent
unshielded thruster, forcing the acceleration region to move further downstream. The potential
implication on thruster wear is therefore that such displacement could lead to more radially
divergent ions with sufficient energy to sputter the front pole surfaces. In fact, some of the mis-
construed early arguments were that magnetic shielding simply traded wear out processes by
protecting the channel walls at the expense of the front poles. This is of course not true. Numer-
ical simulations of both unshielded and magnetically shielded versions of the H6 showed that
the current density of the radially divergent high-energy ions was high enough to cause observ-
able sputtering of the poles in the H6MS. But it was also found that this current density was
three orders of magnitude lower than that of axially accelerated ions [65]. Consequently, the
sputtering of these surfaces in magnetically shielded thrusters is considerably lower than those
along the channel walls of unshielded thrusters. In fact, it is low enough that front pole erosion
can be easily mitigated for long duration missions using thin protective pole covers made of low-
sputtering material such as graphite. This approach was successfully demonstrated in the H6MS
thruster [12, 66], and subsequently in both HERMeS [26] and MaSMi [58]. The ion energy
impinging on the pole covers was found to be reduced and regulated by electrically
connecting the cathode common to the thruster body [67, 68]. The subsequent front pole cover

erosion rates were measured to be at least one order of magnitude lower than those along the
channel walls of unshielded Hall thrusters. A comparison of typical erosion rates along these
surfaces is provided in Fig. 8-15. Also included on the plot for comparison is a typical range
of backsputtered carbon rates in some existing vacuum facilities used for testing high power
ion and Hall thrusters.

Chapter 9
Electromagnetic Thrusters
9.1
Introduction
Electromagnetic thrusters produce thrust by accelerating the plasma with the Lorentz force, which
is generated when an electrical current flows transverse to an applied and/or self-induced magnetic
field. There are several different thruster configurations that can generate the Lorentz force for pro-
pulsion. This chapter describes three of the more technologically mature examples of these types of
thrusters.
9.2
Magnetoplasmadynamic Thrusters
Magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) thrusters are high-power electric propulsion devices [1–3] that are
classified as electromagnetic (EM) thrusters because they utilize electromagnetic forces to acceler-
ate the plasma. An MPD thruster basically consists of a central rod-shaped cathode insulated from a
cylindrical anode that surrounds the cathode, as seen in Fig. 9-1. A high-current electron discharge
is driven between cathode and anode that ionizes the propellant gas injected from the backplane to
create plasma. The azimuthal component of the magnetic field interacts with the current flowing
radially from cathode to anode to produce an electromagnetic Lorentz force that accelerates the
plasma out of the engine generating thrust. MPD thrusters will be classified here either as self-field
where an azimuthal magnetic field is generated only by the internal plasma current flowing from
cathode to anode, or applied-field where an external solenoid (shown in the figure) is used to pro-
vide an additional magnetic field that can help stabilize discharge instabilities and, if large enough,
produce additional acceleration of the plasma.
Electromagnetic acceleration was first recognized [4] in a hydrogen arcjet thruster during experi-
ments at low propellant gas flow rates and high discharge current aimed at increasing the level of
ionization. High Isp was reported with efficiencies over 50% and power levels over 250 kW. The
authors concluded that the high current discharges were generating self-magnetic fields that
“helped to contain and accelerate the plasma” [4].
In MPD thrusters there are three main effects that generate electromagnetic thrust. First, the
plasma is accelerated in the axial direction because of the Lorentz force from the radial electron
current flowing from the cathode to the anode crossed with the self-generated azimuthal magnetic
field from the current running axially on the cathode electrode. This contribution has been histor-
ically called electromagnetic “blowing”. Second, there is radially inward acceleration of the plasma

because of an axial component of the electron current flowing from cathode to anode crossed with
the azimuthal magnetic field. This second term is historically called electromagnetic “pinching”,
and represents the force in the thruster that compresses the plasma radially toward the axis. Finally,
if there is an applied magnetic field in the thruster that has components in the axial and radial direc-
tions, the plasma will “swirl” azimuthally about the axis because of the jrBz and jzBr forces generated
in the thruster. Cold gas contributions to the thrust are usually significantly smaller than those from
the electromagnetic force.
MPD thrusters utilize electron discharges at power levels from kilowatts up to several megawatts to
produce tens to hundreds of newtons of thrust at Isps of 1,000–10,000 s and higher [5–9].
They process more power and produce higher thrust than ion and Hall thrusters, but equivalent
thruster lifetimes and efficiencies have not yet been demonstrated. MPD thrusters have demon-
strated operation with a wide variety of propellants including H2, He, Li, N2, NH3, Ne, Na, Ar, K,
Kr, Xe, and Bi. They typically run at low discharge voltages (<250 V) to minimize erosion of the dis-
charge electrodes, and light propellants are used to obtain higher Isp. Self-field MPDs typically have
efficiencies between 30–50%, and obtaining thruster lifetimes beyond 1000 h has to date been chal-
lenging because of component erosion. High-power MPD thrusters that use lithium as the propellant
have demonstrated efficiencies above 60% [7, 10]. MPD thrusters also have significantly higher thrust
density than ion and Hall thrusters, making high-power thrusters more compact.
As a result of these promising demonstrated performance parameters, there is continuing
research and development in MPD thrusters to achieve improved efficiencies and lifetimes in
the higher power and thrust regime not achievable by other electric thrusters. This work will
increase in interest as power levels on the order of megawatts or more becomes available in space.
The research and development goals are to obtain higher Isp at the increased power levels, enhan-
cing the efficiency, and significantly improving thruster lifetime, perhaps up to an order of mag-
nitude or more.

the Lorentz force acceleration is generated purely by the discharge current from cathode to anode.
The cathode is one of the main life-limiting components in the thruster. MPD cathodes have been
made of refractory metals such as tungsten [11], thoriated tungsten [12], or barium-supplied or
impregnated tungsten [13, 14], hollow cathodes [15] and multi-channel hollow cathodes
[16, 17]. Anode erosion can also limit the thruster life, and anodes have been made of refractory
metals such as molybdenum and tungsten [12] in self-radiating designs, or water-cooled metals
such as copper in higher power, continuous operation designs.
The mechanical configuration of various self-field thrusters has been described in the literature
[7, 12]. Self-field MPD thrusters require high-discharge power to efficiently produce significant
levels of thrust because the self-induced magnetic field is relatively weak unless very high discharge
currents are applied, typically of several kiloamperes and above. This has prompted much of the
testing of these thrusters to be pulsed on millisecond time scales to avoid the high-power electron-
ics, the high heat loads on the thruster components, and the high gas load on the vacuum facility
that causes high background pressures and spurious thrust measurements. Pulsed high-power
MPD thrusters can achieve quasi-steady electromagnetic acceleration of the ionized plasma,
but not thermal equilibrium, and the results can be difficult to scale directly to steady-state perfor-
mance [2]. Models that can predict the thrust and performance are then critically important in guid-
ing the development of this technology for flight applications.
9.2.1.1
Idealized Model of the Self-Field MPD Thrust
Thrust generation in self-field MPD thrusters was first described in an analytic model of the
acceleration mechanisms by Maecker [18]. The axial force (the “blowing” mechanism) was ana-
lyzed by breaking the cathode into a straight cylindrical section of radius rc and a conical
section representing the end of the rod, as shown in the schematic drawing in Fig. 9-2. A purely
radial electron current flow between the cathode and the anode at a radius ra that is uniform along
the length of the cathode rod in the region from z = 0 to z = z1 is assumed. From Ampere’s Law
given by Eq. 3.2-4, neglecting the displacement current and assuming vacuum, the self-induced
magnetic field in this region is purely azimuthal and proportional to 1/r in the gap. It is assumed
that the radial discharge current is uniform along the cathode and goes to zero at the end of the
cylindrical section. The magnet field can then be described by:
Bθ = μoI

where I = 2πrz1Jr is the total discharge current in this region. The Lorentz force density is then
purely axial:

The total axial force applied to the particle stream is the integral of the force density in Eq. 9.2-2 over

This expression is valid for any distribution of the discharge current along the cathode cylinder as
long as azimuthal symmetry of the generated magnetic field is maintained.
Now we need to consider the force associated with the current from the tip of the cathode. If all of
the current flows into the face of the cathode tip with uniform radial current density, the total axial
force is

If the current is not uniform over the cathode surface, the integral in Eq. 9.2-4 must include this
spatial dependence, but the thrust produced will generally be a lower contribution to the total blow-
ing force from the tip current [1].
The “pinching” contribution to the electromagnetic force can be estimated by assuming all the
discharge current enters the cathode end axially along the thruster axis. The magnetic field pro-
duced is azimuthal, but is now proportional to the cathode radius:
Bθ r = μoI r
2πr2

9 2-5
The Lorentz force generated from Eq. 9.2-5 is now radial, and must be balanced by a radial pressure
gradient:
f r = JzBθ = μoI2 r
2π2r4

= −dp

9 2-6
Assuming the end of the cathode is flat and integrating Eq. 9.2-6, the profile of the fluid pressure
over the cathode face is parabolic:

where po is the pressure in the gap outside the radius of the cathode. Since this pressure is not bal-

thrust:
Fc = 2π

This result does not depend on the radial distribution of the current over the cathode face provided
the azimuthal symmetry of the magnetic field is again maintained.

4. This expression is referred to as the Maecker formula [18], although the constant δ
does not appear in his original derivation. Jahn showed that constants on the order of unity should
be included depending on variations in the cathode geometry [1], and 3/4 tends to provide the best
agreement with data at high current levels [19].
It is possible to show that Eq. 9.2-9 does not depend on the specific path of the discharge current
between the anode and cathode [1]. The forces that need to be considered are on the thruster
surfaces inside a control volume contoured to the inside of the thruster. The downstream
boundaries of the volume are sufficiently far from the thruster that it can be assumed that the
magnetic field is zero and pressure is the ambient value. The total thrust is described by
T = TGD +
V
Jr Bθ dV −
S
p z dS
9 2-10
where V and S are the volume and surface of the control volume, p is the pressure, z is the unit
vector. The first term on the right, TGD, is the gasdynamic contribution to the thrust that results
from the cold gas propellant injected into the control volume. The second term on the right is
the blowing contribution to the thrust, and the third term on the right is the pinching contribution.
The evaluation of the blowing term through volume integration requires detailed knowledge of
the current distribution inside the thruster. Using the divergence theorem, the volume integral can
be replaced by a surface integral and the Lorentz force written in terms of a Maxwell magnetic stress
sensor, β, that satisfies the following equation:
J × B = 1
μo
∇× B × B = ∇β −1
μo
B∇B
9 2-11
Since the divergence of B is zero, the integral of the axial component of the Lorentz force over the
thruster volume gives the blowing contribution to the thrust:
V
JrBθdV =

∇β zdV =

For a coaxial self-field MPD thruster with a symmetric discharge, the magnetic field has only azi-

which is the blowing contribution to the Maecker formula in Eq. 9.2-9. This shows that the blowing
contribution in self-field MPD thrusters does not depend on the details of the current path from
cathode to anode, and so the Maecker formula is applicable to a large range of thruster geometries
[1].
The thrust from self-field MPD thrusters is, therefore, often described as
T = bI2,
9 2-17
where b is a parameter largely dependent on the geometry. Note that the thrust predicted by this
equation is independent of the propellant type and the propellant mass flow rate, and scales simply
as the discharge current squared and the radial size of the thruster.
The validity of the Maecker formula was investigated by Choueiri [5, 20] using data from the
Princeton Benchmark Thruster (PBT) [21, 22]. The data on the thrust versus discharge current from
these papers for two argon mass flow rates is shown in Fig. 9-3, with the Maecker prediction. The
overall agreement between the Maecker formula and the data seems reasonable, especially for such
a simple model.
However, the discrepancy of these simple predictions with discharge mass flow rate and current
is exposed by defining a dimensionless thrust coefficient CT:

Figure 9-4 shows the thrust coefficient CT calculated from the measured thrust by the PBT
[5, 20, 21] versus discharge current for δ = 3

4. This depiction of the data from Fig. 9-3 shows that
at low discharge currents the thrust is dependent on the mass flow rate, and that it differs from the
current squared behavior in the Maecker formula at low discharge currents. At higher discharge
currents where the electromagnetic force is expected to dominate, the Maecker formula overpre-
dicts the magnitude of CT by a significant amount. Although discrepancy can be obviated by using a
different constant for δ in the Maecker formula than 3/4, this is generally arbitrary and will vary
from thruster to thruster.
To better evaluate the surface integral of the third term in Eq. 9.2-10 (the pinching thrust con-
tribution), Choueiri [5] evaluated the radial and axial pressures in the control volume and inte-
grated over the PBT surfaces assuming a nonuniform profile of the pressure over the backplate.
He found that at low current the pinching pressure effects on the backplate of the thruster caused
an increase in CT above the Maecker value, in better agreement with the measured data. Using
empirical data for the unknown current distributions along the electrodes, he showed that at high
current the main contribution to the thrust is from the blowing component at the backplate with a
small contribution from the pinching component. As the current is decreased the pressure profile
on the backplate changes and results in the rise in CT above the Maecker value. The rise in CT at
lower current is not from changes in the thrust caused by the expansion of an ohmically heated gas,
but rather by the scaling of pressure distributions induced by the pinching effect of the volumetric
Lorentz forces.
Tikhonov and Semenihin [23] derived an analytic model that assumes the magnetic and ther-
mal pressures are equal at the downstream end of the channel, and set the upstream end of the

the thrust coefficient at low current, scaling as I −4 and the constant CT at high current. However,
the quantitative agreement with the data remains poor.

For self-field MPD thrusters, similar thrust and Isp can be expected if the value of ξ is similar. In
addition, operation at values of ξ > 1 is related to the onset of current-driven instabilities and large
voltage fluctuations termed “onset”, which will be discussed further in Section 9.2.3.
Figure 9-6 shows the thrust coefficient calculated from Eq. 9.2-22 versus discharge current for the
PBT operating in argon and xenon. The semiempirical model provides quantitative agreement with
the thruster data, and the model predictions are consistent with the data trends at both low and
high current. This scaling model can, therefore, be useful in self-field MPD thruster design and per-
formance optimizations.

9.2 Magnetoplasmadynamic Thrusters

mechanical configurations of applied-field MPD thrusters have been described in several review
papers [2, 7, 8, 12, 25]. The self-induced field from the discharge current is usually significantly less
than the applied-field at low discharge currents, but as the current is increased the self-fields
become comparable to or higher than the applied-induced fields, and the net magnetic field lines
become twisted in a helical fashion. The strong axial component of the applied magnetic field
between the cathode and anode inhibits the electron flow to the anode and causes the electrons
to circulate around the cathode rod reminiscent of the Hall current in Hall thrusters. This also
forces the discharge current and the plasma plume to move downstream of the cathode end to reach
the anode. The fraction of the thrust generated within the channel can be relatively small and the
Lorentz force due to the applied field in this region results in a swirling of the plasma around
the axis of symmetry. Downstream of the cathode tip where the discharge current bends toward
the anode, the axial magnetic field produces an azimuthal component of the force that contributes
to the swirl. The total axial and radial force components then produce the blowing and pinching
contributions to the thrust.
The thrust from an applied field MPD can be produced by a combination of several acceleration
mechanisms, with both the electromagnetic and gas dynamic processes contributing. Four
potential acceleration mechanisms have been identified [2, 8, 26]:
• Self-Field Acceleration Just as in MPD thrusters without an applied magnetic field, the axial
component of the cathode current in applied-field thrusters produces an azimuthal magnetic
field inside the thruster. The radial component of the discharge current between cathode and
anode induces a Lorentz JrBθ force density that produces the axial blowing force, and the axial
component of the discharge current induces a Lorentz JzBθ force density that produces the radial
pinching force. The axial blowing force contributes directly to the total self-field thrust TSF, and
the radial pinching force contributes indirectly to the thrust because of a pressure imbalance on
the center cathode electrode.
• Hall Acceleration If the applied magnetic field is high enough, and the internal pressure is low
enough such that the Hall parameter (defined in Chapter 3) is significantly greater than 1, an
azimuthal current will be induced reminiscent of that found in Hall thrusters. The induced azi-
muthal current and the applied magnetic field produce the blowing JθBr force density and pinch-
ing JθBz force density components in a similar manner to the self-field case. This contribution of
the Hall acceleration thrust TH to the total thrust likely only becomes significant for large applied
magnetic fields.
• Swirl Acceleration The Lorentz force interaction of the radial and axial components of the
applied magnetic field and the discharge current (JrBz and JzBr) causes the plasma to rotate (swirl)
in the azimuthal direction. A magnetic nozzle formed by the diverging magnetic field in the exit
region of the thruster can convert this rotational energy to axial thrust TSW because of the expan-
sion of the rotating plasma through the magnetic field, at which point the accelerated plasma
detaches from the magnetic field lines [27].
• Gasdynamic Acceleration A gasdynamic component of the thrust TGD is also produced from
joule heating of the propellant gas similar to that found in electrothermal arcjets. This term
becomes significant when the mass flow rate is high or collisional heating of the gas is
substantial.
Based on these descriptions, the total thrust produced by an applied-field MPD thruster has been
traditionally expressed as the sum of these contributions:
T = TSF + TH + TSW + TGD,

The self-field contribution TSF was described in Section 9.2.2 above and still applies to applied-
field MPD thrusters. The Hall and swirl components in Eq. 9.2-27 are discussed in the next Sec-
tion. The gasdynamic contribution to the thrust, TGD, is the result of the conversion of internal
energy into directed kinetic energy in the nozzle formed by the anode. This term is often
neglected at high powers where the other electromagnetic terms dominate, but at low values
of the discharge current and applied magnetic field, or at high mass flow rates, TGD can be sub-
stantial [26]. This component depends on the mass flow rate, the velocity at the injection site,
the gas dynamic pressure inside the nozzle, and the nozzle area over which that pressure is
applied.
9.2.2.1
Empirical and Semi-empirical Thrust Models
Self-field MPD thrusters operating below the critical current for onset show a relatively straightfor-
ward thrust scaling proportional to bI2, as described above. However, the numerous possible accel-
eration mechanisms present in an applied-field MPD represent a much more complicated endeavor
in producing a thrust model. Most models published to date [23, 26, 28–32] are empirical or semi-
empirical; thus, partially obscuring a comprehensive explanation of the dominant acceleration
mechanisms. Moreover, in most cases these models have not been validated by comparisons to
a wide and diverse range of experimental data, but rather applied to one or two specific thrusters
from the original authors. A notable exception is the recent work by Coogan [26] who assembled an
extensive database of relevant measurements from applied-field thruster experiments, reviewed
almost all existing thrust models, provided comparisons and, ultimately, proposed a new empirical
model.
With the exception of Coletti [33] and Sasoh and Arakawa [32], most of the cited thrust models
above provide simple analytic expressions, which is a sought-after feature by the MPD designer
because they are straightforward to apply. However, they also suffer from notable drawbacks. Spe-
cifically, most of them [23, 26, 28–31] scale the applied-field thrust TAF linearly with the product of
current and applied magnetic field, TAF IBA. For example, in the empirical formula developed by
Coogan [26] based on fits to measurements in their extensive database, this linear dependence on
IBA is clear:
TCoogan = 1 14 IBAraΦ
−0 13 ra rc
−0 3 10 + lc la
−0 67
9 2-28
In Eq. 9.2-28, Φ is the magnetic flux at the anode exit plane normalized to the magnetic flux at the
anode throat (minimum anode inner diameter), lc is the cathode length, and la is the anode
length. Physically Φ = 1 represents an anode contoured to the magnetic field, and Φ>1 represents
an anode that diverges rapidly compared to the magnetic field. The authors emphasized the signif-
icance of the parameter Φ, which was absent in previous models, and led to an improved fit to
the thrust measurements. They argued that the improvement was largely due to a better represen-
tation of the effective anode radius and the volume over which the Lorentz force acts. Nevertheless,
the linear dependence of thrust on IBA remains intact in Eq. 9.2-28 and consistent with previous
empirical models that are widely reported in the literature. The drawback with such scaling is
that the best linear fits to the data do not yield the expected limit that the thrust must approach
zero, or more accurately approach the cold thrust value, as the current goes to zero at finite
applied field BA. By “cold thrust” we mean the force produced by injecting propellant
through the thruster in the absence of a discharge, which is typically negligible compared to
the self-field and applied-field components (in the presence of the discharge) except when
the flow is very high. This is clearly illustrated by the dashed lines in the representative example
9.2 Magnetoplasmadynamic Thrusters
371

of the Moscow Aviation Institute’s (MAI) 30-kW Lithium thruster in Fig. 9-7. Moreover, empir-
ical models akin to those in Eq. 9.2-28 do not account for all controllable parameters, like the
mass flow rate and propellant mass, which are both known to affect thrust as shown below in
Figs. 9-8 and 9-9.
9.2.2.2
First-principles Thrust Model
The complexity of the physics in the applied-field MPD made first-principles ab initio thrust models
challenging to develop and validate. A notable exception is the theoretical work of P. Mikellides and
Turchi [34] who employed extensive 2-D axisymmetric resistive magnetohydrodynamic simula-
tions to guide the development of their thrust model. They recognized that the (viscous) Reynolds
number associated with the plasma swirl can be in the tens to hundreds [36] and argued that
applied-field MPD operation is dominated and limited by viscous effects. Specifically, they proposed
that the rotational speed produced by JrBz is opposed by viscous forces, which gives rise to a critical
maximum rotational speed υ∗:
υ∗= IBA
μ
9 2-29
where μ is the ion dynamic viscosity. Thus, as IBA is increased the swirling flow becomes fully devel-
oped and thus the rotational speed reaches the maximum critical speed beyond which point it is
independent of IBA. Further increase of IBA does not result in increasing azimuthal speed, rather
viscous dissipation converts such rotational kinetic energy to internal energy [36]. This is similar to
the Alfven critical speed [24] that limits self-field thrusters; once the plasma reaches such critical
speed, deposition to internal modes dominates as opposed to exhaust kinetic energy conversion, the
so-called onset phenomenon.
For applied-field thrusters, this critical speed arises from viscous dissipation, thus the main accel-
eration mechanism is conversion of enthalpy – increased by viscous heating – to exhaust kinetic

implying that viscous forces are indeed quite significant when compared to inertial forces [36]. Fur-
thermore, the simulations revealed that Hall acceleration is almost non-existent due to anomalous

authors developed a first-principles analytical model, which in conjunction with the self-field thrust
contribution TSF from Eq. 9.2-9, yields the total thrust in the applied-field MPD thruster:

and C = 25 ms½, M is the dimensionless numerical value of the propellant’s atomic/molecular
mass, a = rc/l, ζ is the average degree of ionization, R = ra/rc. For the self-field thrust TSF, the param-
eter δ is in the range 0 ≤δ ≤3/4. The dimensional variables are in SI units. The parameter l repre-
sents the electrode length along which current conduction occurs, in most cases the anode length
suffices. For flared anodes an average radius will produce more accurate results. For calculation of
the average degree of ionization, the Saha equation can be used even though for most cases assum-
ing fully singly ionized plasma, ζ=1, will produce acceptable estimates.
The model is distinct from all others as it scales TAF
mIBA and includes dependence on the
propellant mass. The square-root dependence with the product IBA is also consistent with the con-
clusions from the experimental findings of Coogan [35] in two lithium MPD thrusters, who found
that the applied-field thrust component is not proportional to current or applied field strength, as
has been assumed in much of the literature, but it is more closely proportionate to
IBA. Coogan
also found the square-root dependence on the mass flow rate,
m, as P. Mikellides predicted, but
incorrectly contended that viscous effects were not significant.
A comparison of the thrust predicted by Eqs. 9.2-30 and 9.2-31 with measurements from two dif-
ferent thrusters is presented in Figs. 9-7 and 9-8. The model by P. Mikellides predicts the correct
limit for the thrust as the current approaches zero at finite applied field. Furthermore, the data at
0.1 T showed the significant effect of the different mass flow rates on the thrust. It is worthwhile
to note that the MAI thruster utilized a recessed hollow cathode with a flared anode. Figure 9-8
compares the model to the LeRC 100-kW AF MPD [31] operating with two different propellants,
hydrogen and argon, which have substantially different atomic/molecular masses. The dependence
on propellant type is clear, which implies that any high-fidelity thrust model must include such
dependence.
To fully validate any first-principles model, a comparison to a wide and diverse range of
experimental data is required. Figure 9-9 shows such comparison of the model by P. Mikellides
Eq. 9.2-30, which includes both the self-field and applied-field effects, to selected applied-field
MPD thrust data (MAI [35], LeRC [31], Alta [37], HC8 [38], HPT [39] and MY-I [40], which include
thrusters with recessed cathodes, hollow cathodes, flared anodes, pre-ionization, and propellant
injection schemes as well as a variety of propellants, geometries, and operating conditions. The
excellent agreement establishes the high fidelity of the model and, perhaps more importantly, con-
sidering that Eqs. 9.2-30 and 9.2-31 are the derivations from a purely analytical and computational
exercise, it offers the opportunity to gain deeper insight into the driving processes of applied-field
MPD operation compared to empirical or semi-empirical approaches. It should be recognized that
research in this area is still ongoing.
9.2.2.3
Lithium Applied-Field MPD Thrusters
Applied-field MPD thrusters that use lithium are sometimes called Lorentz Force Accelerators
(LFA), and are characterized by the use of lithium propellant and the inclusion of a multichannel

hollow cathode as the electron emitter. Lithium has several advantages over conventional gaseous
propellants like xenon and argon, and other alkali metals [15]. Lithium has a lower first ionization
potential (5.4 eV) than the other propellants (e.g. 12.1 eV for xenon), which means less power is
spent on ionization. In addition, lithium has a very high second ionization potential (75.6 eV com-
pared to 21.0 for Xenon), reducing the production of multiply charged ions in the discharge. Using
lithium as the propellant, therefore, helps to reduce these frozen flow losses, and may reduce the
work function of the cathode surface.
The performance using lithium as the propellant has significantly exceeded those of other
propellants. Lithium MPD thrusters developed in Russia have reported efficiencies above 50% in
steady state operation for hundreds of hours at power levels of 400–500 kW [10]. Operation at lower
power levels is improved because the applied field offsets the lower self-field occurring from lower
discharge currents. For example, a 100 kW MPD thruster, shown in Fig. 9-10, operating with <0.1 T
applied fields achieved up to 40% efficiency at a discharge current of 1–2 kA and a voltage of only
50–70 V [41]. Note in the design of this steady-state thruster the use of a central lithium vaporizer
inside the multichannel hollow cathode, the external magnetic coil, and the conical anode. Oper-
ating a modified version of this thruster at higher powers up to 200 kW led to increases in efficiency
over 50% and Isp to over 5000 s [42].
Research on lithium-fed applied-field MPD thrusters continues in the US, primarily at Princeton
University [43], and a 1-MW steady-state test facility has been established but not yet operated at
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Significant research on various MPD thruster configurations also
continues in Europe, Russia, and Asia [8, 44]. Lithium MPD thrusters are attractive from an effi-
ciency viewpoint, and using a solid, storable propellant allows more compact tankage for long dura-
tion operation in space. However, lithium is a condensable propellant with the potential to coat
sensitive spacecraft and payload surfaces, and such plume effect must be carefully considered.
The use of non-condensable gas propellants mitigates possible ground handling and spacecraft con-
tamination issues associated with lithium/metallic propellants, but significant further development
is required to provide comparable efficient thruster performance.

9.2.3
Onset Phenomenon
It has been observed in all MPD thrusters that there is a critical discharge current above which the
discharge voltage increases nonlinearly and becomes noisy, and electrode erosion (primarily the
anode) is observed to increase. An example of the increase in the discharge voltage magnitude
and noise level measured in an MPD thruster as the discharge current is raised [45] is shown in
Fig. 9-11. This behavior, first reported in the United States by Malliaris in 1972 [46], became known
as the onset phenomenon, or simply onset, and has been confirmed by a number of researchers in
many laboratories worldwide. Onset in MPD thrusters is a significant problem that limits the Isp
attainable by constraining the discharge current, and, therefore, limiting the thrust, at a given flow
rate [47]. Application of a weak magnetic field in the downstream region of the anode in self-field
thrusters was shown to delay onset to higher currents [10, 48]. These thrusters then enter the class
of applied-field thrusters, and optimizing the shape and strength of the magnetic field has been
shown to significantly reduce onset-related behaviors [48].
To describe onset, Malliaris identified a critical value k, which is essentially a constant for a given
thruster, above which onset occurs:
k = I2
m
9 2-32
The onset condition is usually defined as the value of k at which high-frequency voltage fluctuation
levels exceed 10% peak-to-peak of the discharge voltage. An example of the discharge voltage trend
in an MPD thruster as the current is increased for three increasing propellant flow rates is shown in
Fig. 9-12. The voltage first increases linearly with discharge current, indicative of resistivity in the
plasma associated with the current crossing the magnetic field lines to the anode. At a higher cur-
rent, the voltage scales as I3 associated with electromagnetic effects dominating the discharge volt-
age [12]. At a critical current that depends on the gas flow rate, the discharge voltage increases
significantly associated with onset.
An onset criterion that includes a dependence on propellant atomic weight was later proposed by
Hügel [49]:

Since k∗is thruster-dependent constant, using lower atomic mass propellants (e.g. lithium, hydro-
gen) in a given thruster design allows stable operation at higher discharge currents before the tran-
sition to onset-related behavior occurs. Also, thruster geometries and flow conditions that increase
the plasma density near the anode have been found to increase the transitional value of k∗. For
example, propellant injection close to the anode surface was found to increase the value of k∗at
which onset occurs [50].
A detailed review of the large body of literature published over the years on onset can be
found in Appendix D of the Ph.D. thesis of Uribarri [51]. Once the onset threshold current
is exceeded, the magnitude of the voltage noise (hash) increases significantly and the erosion
of all thruster components, in particular that of the anode, rises steadily with increasing cur-
rent [52]. In addition, localized anode spots (sometimes erroneously called anode arcs) associ-
ated with current concentration and local melting appear on the anode surface as the discharge
current is increased above onset [45, 53]. The development of anode spots is indicative of large
anode sheath voltages that increase the power into the anode surface and evolve material into
the gap that can then be ionized and create more charge carriers. The concentration of the
discharge and localization of the heating to erode more material to fuel the spot is similar
to the process in cathode arc formation, except that it is electron bombardment heating and
sublimating the anode surface instead of ions bombarding a cathode surface. The voltage fluc-
tuations (“hash”) are then explained by the formation, extinction, and movement of anode
spots [53]. While not triggering onset, anode spots appear to be generated in onset and are
unacceptable for long-duration thruster operation in space due to the extreme erosion of
the anode surface.
The critical current at which onset occurs was discussed in Section 9.2.2.2. In his derivation of the
thrust coefficient CT described there, Choueiri [5] defined the critical current Ici (given in Eq. 9.2-22).
This led to the derivation of a nondimensional thruster current ξ = I/Ici given in Eq. 9.2-24 that
was used to estimate the thrust in self-field MPDs using Eq. 9.2-20, but where ξ > 1 also results
in onset.
Another approach toward an analytic description of the onset current in self-field MPDs was
developed by Tikhonov and Semenihin [23] and described by Kodys [8]. Tikhonov defined a term

developed by Tikhonov and explained by Kodys [8]. Tikhonov defined a term AB

of the electromagnetic to gasdynamic pressure at the location of the transition from subsonic to

The values of ξT and ξB predict the stable operating limits in self-field and applied-field thruster.
Operation with these terms greater than 1 results in reduced performance [8], higher voltage fluc-
tuations, and increased erosion.
As discussed below, there are two primary theories for onset; anode starvation and plasma
instabilities, although, additional effects that may contribute to onset have also been discussed
in the literature [2, 51].

9 Electromagnetic Thrusters

9.2.3.1
Anode Starvation
The discharge current is carried to the anode by the plasma electrons that have a flux to anode
sheath edge determined by the plasma density and electron temperature. In the MPD thruster,
the axial component of the electron current interacting with the azimuthal component of the
self-induced magnetic field produces a radial inward Lorentz force that results in “pinching” of
the plasma toward the axis described in Section 9.2.2.1. This motion reduces the plasma density
at the anode, which lowers the flux of electrons arriving at the anode sheath edge and potentially
“starving” the discharge current collection.
Anode starvation can be understood by examining the electron current collected by the anode
from the local plasma. For plasma potentials positive relative to the anode (an “electron-repelling”
sheath), the electron current that passes through the sheath, Ia, and collected at the anode is the
surface integral of the random electron flux from the local plasma density over the anode area A
times the Boltzmann factor for the effect of the sheath on the transmitted current:
Ia =
1
4 n r, z e
8kTe
πm dA e
e Va −ϕp
kTe
,
9 2-41
where n(r,z) is the plasma density at the anode sheath, k is Boltzmann’s constant, Va is the anode
potential, and ϕp is the plasma potential relative to the anode. If the system is trying to drive more
electron current to the anode than the random electron flux from the plasma integrated over the
anode area, then the plasma potential goes negative relative to the anode potential [54] (called a
“positive going” or “electron accelerating” sheath that produces an “anode fall” voltage). This
increases the electron current collection by the anode by pulling in electrons in the Maxwellian
distribution that are not initially headed toward the anode. The plasma electron current collected
by the anode then becomes [55]

πm dA e
e Va −ϕp

9 2-42
where (Va −ϕp) is now negative and the current integral is still over the entire anode surface. The
increased anode sheath voltage acts to accelerate the electrons into the anode, which increases
the power deposition and can lead to anode spots and plasma instabilities that show up as voltage
fluctuations or “hash” on the discharge voltage signals.
Anode starvation is a direct result of the pinch force in MPD thrusters reducing the plasma
density near the anode. Applied-field MPDs provide a counter to this mechanism because the
axial component of the applied field that inhibits the radial plasma motion and results in rotation
or swirl. Optimizing the shape and magnitude of the applied magnetic field relative to the anode
has been shown to significantly decrease the start of onset [48]. Over a broad range of currents,
optimally applied magnetic fields reduce the amplitude and frequency of the voltage fluctuations,
decrease the anode fall voltages, and lower the mean discharge voltages. These results imply sub-
stantial improvements in efficiency and lifetime are likely to be obtained through the use of
appropriately designed and tailored applied magnetic fields to locally influence near-anode phe-
nomena that drive onset [56]. This also suggests that increases in the anode-adjacent particle
density, through local propellant injection [57] or geometry changes [47], could delay starvation
and onset.
9.2 Magnetoplasmadynamic Thrusters

9.2.3.2
Plasma Instabilities
Another explanation for onset phenomena is related to plasma instabilities. Various theories have
been developed that suggest that operation at or above the critical onset current creates conditions
in the thruster channel that results in the growth of unstable oscillation modes. Choueiri [58] inves-
tigated current driven instabilities such as ion cyclotron waves in MPDs. Tilley et al. [59] investi-
gated lower hybrid and electron-cyclotron drift instabilities in a 10 kW self-field MPD thruster.
Wagner et al. [60] investigated space-charge gradient-driven instabilities, and Maurer et al. [61]
and Wagner et al. [62] examined drift waves in MPD thrusters. However, as pointed out by Andre-
nucci [2], these results and others in the literature contribute to understanding the fluctuation
levels observed in the thruster voltage and in the plasma parameters [63], and anomalous transport
and energy transfer effects in MPD thrusters, but don’t appear to be directly related to the funda-
mental occurrence of onset phenomena.
9.2.3.3
Other Onset Effects
In addition to the theories described above, a number of additional theories can be found in the
literature. For example, Lawless et al. [64] attribute onset to the generation of a back EMF that
reduces the electric field and flow in the plasma. They examined a fully ionized, composition-
ally-frozen flow and both equilibrium and non-equilibrium flow from cathode to anode in the dis-
charge and found, under conditions related to onset, that a back-EMF was generated that reduced
the total electric field to levels insufficient to drive the desired current. Several macroscopic instabil-
ities have also been proposed for explaining onset. Zuin et al. [65, 66] investigated MHD instabilities
that produced a rotating kink instability that they related on onset occurrence. Schrade et al.
[67, 68] examined a macroscopic helical instability in a discharge column between cathode and
anode, and claimed that the concentration of the discharge into the helical channel was indicative
of onset behavior and also anode damage. Additional papers describing other potential theories for
onset are listed in Uribarri’s Ph.D. thesis Appendix [51].
9.2.4
MPD Thruster Performance Parameters
There have been surveys of MPD thruster performance published periodically over the years [7, 8,
12, 22, 44, 69, 70]. These papers show the significant improvements in performance and life due to
better understanding of the thruster physics combined with the addition of applied magnetic fields
and the use of propellants such as lithium. Some trends, summarized by Kodys [8] are:
• At low powers (<50 kW), applied-field thrusters can obtain the same levels of efficiency and Isp
achieved by megawatt-class self-field thrusters, of course at much lower thrust. This is primarily
because the Isp is increased by the addition of the applied magnetic field at a given power.
• An optimal applied field strength and shape exists that depends on the thruster power, propel-
lant, mass flow rate, and geometry.
• Injection of some fraction of the propellant through the anode or near the anode surface has been
shown to improve performance.
• Lithium and hydrogen propellants have demonstrated the highest efficiency and Isp.
• A hollow cathode or multi-channel hollow cathode can sustain higher currents with less erosion
than a solid rod cathode.
Several papers have also described scaling laws for the thruster parameters [6, 12, 22]. The thrust
in self-field MPDs scales (below onset) as bI2. The corresponding discharge voltage was described by
Sovey [12] as given by

where J is the current density, σ is the plasma conductivity, v is the plasma velocity, B is the mag-
netic field strength, dl is the path length from cathode to anode, and VF is a voltage “fall” accounting
for the drop in the sheath potentials. Integrating the first term yields an Ohm’s law dependence that
produces a linear dependence of the voltage on the discharge current. Integrating the second term
for the electromagnetic effects, assuming thrust proportional to bI2 as the dominant component in
self-field MPDs, gives a voltage term proportional to the current cubed:
V
b2I3
m
9 2-44
As the discharge current is increased, the electromagnetic voltage term will dominate over the lin-
ear ohmic term, as illustrated in Fig. 9-10. For the voltage at high discharge currents described by
Eq. 9.2-47, the power into the thruster (I times V) scales as the discharge current to the fourth
power. These ideal self-field MPD thruster scaling laws were summarized by Andrenucci and Paga-
nucci [6] as:
TSF
I2, V
I3, P
I4
9 2-45
Applied-field thrusters are much more complicated and simple scaling laws like these are not gen-
erally available. The thrust from the empirical and semi-empirical applied-field thruster models
described in Section 9.2.2.1 scale as
TAF
k IBA
9 2-46
where k is a constant that depends on the anode radius and other geometric terms. The Isp then
scales as
IspAF
kIBA
m
9 2-47
However, the thruster discharge voltage and power are now complicated parameters depending on
the magnitude of the various thrust mechanisms given in Eq. 9.2-25 that vary as the geometry and
operating conditions of the thruster are established and the discharge current is increased.
The first-principles theoretical model by P. Mikellides and Turchi [36] differs from all the others
in that it proposes that the applied-field thrust scales as
TAF
k
mIBA
9 2-48
where k depends on geometry and propellant type and suggests additional and specific avenues for
improvements. Likewise, the Isp then scales as
IspAF
k

m
9 2-49
The P. Mikellides model for the applied-field component Eq. 9.2-31 also contains a propellant mass
dependence that is consistent with observations that low atomic/molecular mass propellants, e.g.
hydrogen, improve performance, and provides a physical explanation for this effect. Furthermore,
the effort produced analytic expressions for plasma voltage and flow efficiency that suggests an opti-
mum thruster geometry. Specifically, the model proposes that narrow flow channels (1.5 ≤R ≤2) in
combination with short electrodes will maximize efficiency.
9.2 Magnetoplasmadynamic Thrusters

Finally, the life of MPD thrusters for proposed mission applications is a serious concern and
active area of research. The power density and the total power of MPD thrusters are generally
so high that materials issues and cooling become serious issues. Onset and anode spots must
be avoided at all cost because of the severe erosion of the anode observed. The use of large area
hollow cathodes, anode propellant injection, flared-anode geometries with optimized applied
magnetic fields, and light propellants have all been observed to reduce the erosion rates and
extend the life of MPD thrusters. More theoretical and experimental efforts are needed to increase
the life and total impulse capabilities of MPD thruster by thoroughly examining the effects of
electrode design, applied fields, and operating conditions on the electrode lifetime and perfor-
mance of the thruster.
9.3
Ablative Pulsed Plasma Thrusters
Pulsed Plasma Thrusters (PPT) were employed on a microsatellite very early in the history of elec-
tric propulsion due to their simplicity, robustness and the ability to operate in pulses at low average
power. In fact, one of the first application of electric propulsion was on board the Russian spacecraft
Zond-2 during a mission to Mars in late 1964 where six, ablation-fed, coaxial PPTs were used to
provide attitude control. Only four years later, the Lincoln Experimental Satellite 6 (LES-6) success-
fully used PPTs in a rectangular configuration for east-west station keeping. The four PPTs were
developed and flight-qualified by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Lincoln Labo-
ratory and, combined with cold gas microthrusters, became the first completely automatic, self-
contained station keeping system to be demonstrated in space [71].
Missions successfully employed ablative PPTs in the 1970s and 1980s mainly for drag make-up
and precision spacecraft position control [72, 73]. Flight qualification of PPTs at various labora-
tories continued [74, 75] during this period. For a more in-depth review of the early history and
laboratory investigations of the PPT, the reader may refer to Burton and Turchi [76]. The first PPT
flight for a NASA mission was on the Earth Observer – 1 (EO-1) spacecraft launched in 2000. The
onboard PPT experiment, shown in Figures 1–8, was aimed at demonstrating precision pointing
accuracy, response and stability, and to confirm that the thruster plume and EMI effects on the
spacecraft and instruments were inconsequential. The single PPT on EO-1 was used successfully
for pitch attitude control and accumulated over 26 h of operation with over 96,000 pulses [77].
More recently, PPTs have been flown and operated successfully on the HuskySat-1 [78] and
1-U Cubsats [79]. Finally, in 2019, Champaign-Urbana Aerospace, LLC, was selected by
NASA to develop and demonstrate in-space operation of a fiber-fed PPT on the 6U CubeSat
DUPLEX [80].
Of all the existing electric thruster concepts, the PPT was the first to gain acceptance for space
flight applications mainly because of its system simplicity, use of a solid propellant, simple electrode
geometry and a common form of energy storage (capacitors). Owing to its state as a solid, the pro-
pellant, which is usually some form of polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon®), requires no special tank-
age to contain it in space and thereby bypasses the complexities and risks associated with gas valves.
As an alternative to reaction wheels, PPTs are especially well suited for attitude precision control
on small satellites considering they are also low-mass and with power requirements in the range of
<1 W to only a few hundred watts. In addition to its simplicity, robustness, low mass and power
requirements, the PPT is also a low-cost device that can provide relatively high Isps, in some cases
exceeding 1000 s, as will be shown later. In the selection process for space applications, these
382
9 Electromagnetic Thrusters

advantages overshadowed the historically poor performance of this thruster; thrust efficiency gen-
erally ranged only 2–12%. Interest in PPTs continues today and is now largely driven by the rapidly
growing microsatellite industry.
The basic set-up and operation of the PPT are illustrated in Fig. 9-13. The more traditional breech-
fed rectangular geometry is shown here for ease of representation. Its main components are two
parallel electrodes that are connected to an energy storage source, a solid insulator used as the pro-
pellant (usually Teflon®) and an igniter plug, which is mounted on one of the two electrodes. After
charging the energy storage capacitor to a given voltage, the igniter plug is fired producing a minus-
cule amount of initial plasma that has sufficient electrical conductivity to trigger a current dis-
charge across the exposed propellant surface. The discharge contains enough energy to cause
ablation of material from the surface, which is subsequently ionized and accelerated by electromag-
netic and gas dynamic forces.
9.3.1
Thruster Configurations and Performance
Traditionally, these thrusters have been operated under pulsed conditions. The term “pulsed” refers
to operation with transient current waveforms during which all relevant parameters are (in gen-
eral) strong functions of time. In most such cases, the discharge travels along the electrodes away
from the ablating surface in a “slug” mode (Fig. 9-13) since the flow from the propellant does not
provide electrically conducting material fast enough to sustain the arc position along the propellant
surface. Other ablative devices were designed to operate in a “quasi-steady” mode in which all per-
tinent discharge and flow parameters approached their steady state values. The current waveforms
in these cases are typically more prolonged and non-reversing and the discharge usually operates in
an “ablation-arc” mode, adjacent to the propellant surface.
In the traditional slug mode, the first PPTs were driven by an inductance-resistance-capacitance
(LRC) electrical circuit, which typically exhibits at least a few current oscillations due to the exter-
nal impedance. These current reversals are unfavorable since the corresponding voltage oscillations
can reduce capacitor life: for high-voltage capacitors, lifetime tends to scale inversely with charging
voltage (to a high power) and decreases rapidly with the number of peak-to-peak voltage reversals.

A typical LRC waveform produced during laboratory testing of a LES-6 PPT is shown in Fig. 9-14.
Also shown for reference on the top right of the plot is a diagram of the electrical circuit depicting
the various circuit elements, namely, the capacitor (subscript “C”), the external transmission line
(subscript “E”) and the plasma discharge (subscript “P”). A more favorable waveform would be one
that does not undergo reversals but such pulses involve more complicated circuitry and usually
require pulse forming networks (PFN).
The pulsed nature of its operation requires a different approach to characterizing the perfor-
mance of the PPT compared to that of steady-state electromagnetic thrusters like the MPD. The
thrust (T) is produced from the acceleration of many discrete increments of mass released from
the propellant, or mass bits mb. Each mass bit is generated during a single pulse that discharges
the energy E0 from the energy-storage element. Since the thrust generated during the pulse is a
function of time, it is convenient to define the impulse per pulse, more commonly referred to as
the impulse-bit Ib, as
Ib =
Tdt
9 3-1
If the frequency of the discharge pulses is f then the corresponding average thrust is given by
T = f Ib
9 3-2
Along the same lines, the equivalent average mass flow rate m is
m = f mb

impulse Isp as

where P = fE0 is the corresponding electrical power delivered to the thruster from the energy

In the laboratory, performance is determined simply by direct measurement of the impulse and
mass bits. The former measurement is typically performed by operating the thruster for thousands
of discharge pulses, measuring the accumulated thrust, and then dividing that value by the pulse
frequency. The mass bit is determined by measuring the mass of the propellant before and after
operation of the thruster and then dividing by the total number of pulses.
The theoreticalpredictionofthe performanceisnot as straightforward.That is because therearetwo
contributions to the propulsive force from the acceleration of the ablated material – electromagnetic
and gas dynamic – neither of which can be easily and accurately determined using rudimentary
analyses. This topic is discussed in more detail in Section 9.3.2.1. Nevertheless, we shall attempt such
analyses here for the purpose of exposing some of the driving processes behind the performance
of this device. Later, we will expand further based on insights from numerical and more in-depth
theoretical modeling.
Following the same lines for the determination of thrust in the MPD in Section 9.2.1.1, the diver-
gence of Maxwell’s magnetic stress tensor, βij = (BiBj −δijB2/2)/μ0 with B, δij and μ0 being the mag-
netic flux density, Kronecker delta and vacuum permeability, respectively, yields the Lorentz force
density (J × B)i acting on a fluid volume VF. In βij, the second term in the parenthesis is known as
the magnetic pressure and the second is the magnetic tension, which becomes important in highly
curved magnetic field topologies. Conversely, the divergence of the particle stress tensor,
σij = nm υiυj yields the gas dynamic force density, where n, m, and υ are the number density, mass,
and velocity of the particles, respectively. The integral of the divergence of the two stresses over the
volume VF yields the total force and equals the rate of change of momentum of the ablated material.
Using Gauss’ theorem, the volume integral may then be expressed in terms of a surface integral over
a control surface S enclosing VF.
The direct integration of the momentum conservation as described here is not trivial and usu-
ally requires numerical simulation, as we will discuss later in Section 9.3.2.1. With a few simpli-
fying assumptions, which come at the expense of accuracy, a more idealized yet still insightful
approach can be formulated by considering the thruster as an electrical circuit element with
an inductance L. For ease of illustration, we consider here a PPT with rectangular geometry
in which the arc discharge has a height h and width w. The two lengths define the area over
which the magnetic and gas dynamic stresses act. Then the electromagnetic (EM) contribution
to the impulse bit requires only knowledge of the inductance gradient L = ∇L and the current
waveform:

where we have approximated L ≈μ0h/w. For more complicated geometries, L will take a different
form as shown for example in Burton and Turchi [76]. The gas dynamic (GD) contribution can be
expressed in most general terms as follows [82]:

where ma and ca are the mass and thermal velocities of each species a. The total impulse bit then is
just the sum of the two contributions:

9 3-8
Although highly idealized, Eqs. 9.3-6 and 9.3-7 illustrate the significance of the current pulse wave-
form, the discharge and propellant geometry and the gas dynamic velocity of the ablated species. It
is largely these few elements that have driven PPT research efforts to improve performance since
the late 1960s.
Over several decades now, a wide range of thruster geometries, current waveforms, and solid pro-
pellants have been investigated at various institutions worldwide. To review some of the different
approaches and findings from these efforts, it is helpful to employ a loosely defined taxonomy of
PPTs as follows. Depending on electrode geometry and orientation of the propellant feed, there are
basically four types of ablative PPT configurations, two in rectangular and two in coaxial arrange-
ments. These are described briefly in the next two sections. As pointed out by Molina-Cabrera [83],
a broader classification is necessary when gas- and liquid-fed pulsed thrusters are considered and
when different ignition approaches are implemented. Here, because we are focusing only on abla-
tive PPTs which are typically ignited in a similar way, the narrower geometry-based classification is
sufficiently useful.
9.3.1.1
Rectangular Configurations
The rectangular or parallel-rail configuration utilizes two parallel rectangular electrodes as shown
in Fig. 9-15 and can be fed with the propellant either in a breech-fed (BF) or a side-fed (SF) manner,
each of which may influence flow behavior. The electrodes are usually parallel to each other but
some investigations explored the effects of angled electrodes on the flow expansion and overall
thruster performance (e.g. see [82]).
The simplicity of the device and the success of the LES-6 PPTs in the late 1960s, inspired the start
of several research programs in the United States during the 1970s to improve thruster performance
and to broaden its applicability. During this time, similar efforts were launched in Japan and China
that continued into the 1980s [84, 85]. Table 9-1 summarizes performance characteristics of selected
PPTs in rectangular geometry with either BF or SF propellant configurations, developed in the late

1960s through the 1980s (data has been taken from [76]). These early efforts were largely laboratory
investigations that provided integrated measurements, such as mass loss and impulse bit, over
many discharges. They eventually subsided in the late 1980s, but a renewed interest in the mid-
90s saw the restart of some of those earlier empirical studies. For the interested reader, a much more
extensive PPT database than the one provided in Table 9-1 was compiled in 2011 by Molina-Cabrera
et al. [83].
It was recognized early that poor propellant mass utilization was one of the major contributors to
the low thrust efficiency, which rarely exceeded 10% at energies E0< 50 J. After a series of spectro-
scopic diagnostics and Faraday Cup measurements in a 20-J BF PPT, Thomassen and Vondra [86]
reported that production of heavy molecules and neutral atoms from the propellant surface per-
sisted long after the capacitor energy was expended, presumably as a result of thermal bombard-
ment by “hot plasma particles.” In an effort to optimize performance by better controlling the mass
ablated per shot, a SF mechanism was attempted and notable performance improvements over the
BF configuration were claimed, when combined with an arrangement that utilized flared electrodes
[86]. A later study, however, by Palumbo and Guman [87] using a 450-J thruster, demonstrated
higher thrust efficiency (as high as 53.4%) with a BF geometry. In a similar effort to discover
the effects of propellant geometry on performance in a 20-J, BF PPT, Yuan-Zhu [85] determined
that higher ratios of propellant height-to-width (for the same exposed area) improved performance
as impulse bit, Isp, and thrust efficiency all increased. A survey of different thermoplastics and
Teflon® seeding yielded no performance improvements, as shown by Palumbo and Guman
[87]. Later, attempts were made to improve Isp by using laminated propellant configurations with
alternating layers of Teflon® and polyethylene, possibly to take advantage of the lower molecular
weight of polyerthylene. These efforts, however, were hampered by surface carbonization and ulti-
mately yielded lower thrust efficiencies [88].
9.3.1.2
Coaxial Configurations
Most initial designs of ablation-fed, coaxial devices closely resembled the gas-fed MPD thruster pro-
totypes. Typically, they were made of a central, cylindrical electrode surrounded by an outer ring-
conductor and, as in the rectangular device, could be supplied with the solid propellant from the

breech or the sides. A BF coaxial thruster with frontal ablation surface is shown in Fig. 9-16 (left).
Figure 9-16 (right) also shows a coaxial device but with a radial-feed and frontal ablation surface.
The nozzle in these devices is usually conical and serves as the anode.
After the Soviets developed the first ablation-fed, coaxial, PPT (later integrated on the Zond-2
spacecraft) most ensuing PPT programs refocused on rectangular PPTs, largely because of the mis-
sion success of the simpler LES-6 thruster. By the late 1970s, activities in electric propulsion had
shifted to other higher power devices, most of which involved gaseous-fed mechanisms. However,
investigations of ablative-fed thrusters continued in Italy using pulsed coaxial accelerators similar
in geometry to their steady-state MPD gas-fed counterparts [89, 90]. A considerable amount of
empirical work was performed on these devices during this time, but their kJ-level operation
and coaxial set-up presented a major difficulty in correlating such work with that from their much
lower energy, rectangular counterparts.
Other coaxial configurations at much lower energy levels (E0≲10 J) were also pursued by Guman
[91], Spanjers [92] and Bushman and Burton [93]. The thruster by Bushman and Burton [93] was
designed to induce an arc-discharge into a cylindrical cavity (resembling a linear pinch device) that
was fed with the solid propellant from two sides. Owing to the large ratio of cavity length to diam-
eter, this device was characterized by a predominantly electrothermal acceleration mechanism
with a relatively high-impulse bit per joule and low Isp. Based on the values provided from the Illi-
nois PPT-3 Lab in [76], at E0 = 7.5 J the thruster produced Isp = 600 s, Ib = 45 μN-s and mb = 75 μg
yielding an efficiency of ηT = 18%. The coaxial version developed by Spanjers [92] was particularly
simple and miniaturized: the current pulse was delivered to the exposed end of a coaxial cable
where the ablation occurred, and, therefore, required no spark plug and associated circuitry. This
micro-PPT produced Ib = 2 N-s at E0 = 0.8 J in a package with a mass of less than 0.5 kg. The thruster
by Guman [91] was more akin to an MPD thruster geometry but with a conical nozzle
section serving as the cathode, whereas the interior electrode was the anode. That thruster pro-
duced Isp > 2000 s at E0 = but impulse bit measurements and thrust efficiencies were not reported.
More coaxial variants have been pursued over the last two decades. For example, Markusic et al.
[94] investigated a thruster in a z-pinch configuration and reported Isp and ηT spanning 240–760 s
and 2–9%, respectively, in the energy range 25 < E0 < 76 J. The Fiber-Fed Pulsed Power Thruster
(FPPT) by Burton [80] uses coaxial electrodes in a motor-driven system that feeds a polytetrafluor-
oethylene (PTFE) fiber, a few mm in diameter, through a hollow central anode. During the dis-
charge, the fiber tip ablates to a conical shape. The coaxial cathode has an inner diameter that
is 3–6 times the anode diameter. The operational principle is different from all previous PPTs in
that the magnetic field topology in the traditional PPT is inverted in the FPPT, which also reverses
the direction of the Lorentz force at the ablating surface. The radially inward magnetic pinch forces

produce a high gas-dynamic pressure on the axis of the thruster and a repeatable pulse-to-pulse mb
with no surface charring. The unfavorable process of propellant charring was observed experimen-
tally in micro-PPTs like that by Spanjers [92], and it was postulated that it is formed by the released
carbon flux returning from the plasma rather than an incomplete decomposition of the Teflon®
[95]. The discharge energy in the FPPT is typically in the range 8 < E0 < 32 J with a measured per-
formance of 800 < Isp < 2450 s and ηT < 10%.
9.3.2
Physics and Modeling
Even though it is structurally and operationally a simple device, the PPT incorporates a variety of
complex physical processes. The most challenging physics are those associated with the transient
ablation of the solid propellant and subsequent breakdown and acceleration of the gaseous pro-
ducts. Heat from the arc discharge diffuses into the solid propellant, causing ablation of the mate-
rial, only a portion of which is ionized and accelerated electromagnetically to speeds exceeding
10 km/s. The rest of the ablated mass is released at much lower speeds (<1 km/s). During the early
investigations in the 1970s and 1980s, the lack of comprehensive theoretical and numerical models
in programs largely devoted to empirical analyses and development of these thrusters limited their
modeling to simplified expressions of the performance. These formulations depended on measure-
ments that were conducted over many discharges and were driven primarily by an effort to separate
the electromagnetic and gas dynamic contributions to the thrust, and/or to correlate mass loss to
external parameters such as capacitor energy and initial circuit impedance by assuming a fixed LRC
circuit [96]. All these formulations provided little insight into the strongly coupled physics of the
ablation and acceleration processes during a single pulse.
9.3.2.1
Numerical Simulations
The failure of the early empirical investigations and idealized models to improve thruster perfor-
mance pointed strongly to the need for a more comprehensive analysis approach that employed
(at least) 2-D numerical simulation. The anticipation was that by self-consistently capturing
the coupling between all three critical phases of thruster operation – ablation, breakdown, and
acceleration – critical (yet elusive at the time) insight could be gained to inform not only how
to improve performance, but also to allow for the advancement of more comprehensive and
predictive analytical models.
The first successful attempt to employ advanced numerical simulation of PPTs was made in the
1990s with the time-dependent, 2½-D code MACH2 [97]. The non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics
(MHD) code was augmented with ablative boundary conditions at the solid propellant surface,
which allowed for the determination of the propellant’s temperature not only at its interface with
the vapor/plasma but also deeper into the propellant [81]. The latter was achieved by solving the
transient 2-D heat diffusion equation in the solid simultaneously with the evolution of the plasma
during the current pulse. An example of the computed temperatures inside the Teflon® propellant
from the first simulations of the LES-6 PPT is depicted in Fig. 9-17.
This capability and subsequent simulations provided several new insights. For example, the LES-
6 PPT simulations captured well the measured impulse bit and showed that the computed mass of
ablated propellant that was electromagnetically accelerated during a single pulse was much less
than the measured mass consumed after thruster operation through many pulses. The simulation
results and comparisons with the measurements are plotted in Fig. 9-18. The mass measurement
was an average value that was determined by dividing the total mass released (over many current
pulses) by the number of pulses. Therefore, it also included mass that was released from the
9.3 Ablative Pulsed Plasma Thrusters

solid propellant between pulses, and/or released during each pulse but not accelerated
electromagnetically.
Although the presence of this “late-time” mass was long conjectured from laboratory investiga-
tions to be the driver of the poor propellant utilization [81, 98], this was the first time that 2-D
numerical simulations coupled a transient temperature-dependent ablation model with the
thruster magnetohydrodynamics, and quantified the fraction of the total ablated mass that is accel-
erated by the Lorentz force. This improved the understanding of the processes associated with the
release of the late-time mass and enabled more in-depth investigations into methods that could
reduce it. For example, in subsequent investigations with MACH2, the authors argued that because
the thickness of propellant containing the mass needed to sustain the discharge increases linearly

with time (in steady state), whereas heat from the plasma diffuses into the solid to a depth that
increases with the square root of time, the fraction of mass within this heated depth that is
above the temperature at which material can decompose can be released from the solid surface
without the benefit of electromagnetic acceleration. They proposed then that electromagnetic uti-
lization of the ablated mass could be improved using current pulses with shorter rising times and
longer decay times than the traditional LRC oscillatory waveforms [99]. Specifically, their numer-
ical simulations showed that an optimized pulse in a typical rectangular configuration, similar to
that in the LES-6 PPT, would require current pulse times in the order of milliseconds at several kA
or a steep rise of the current to tens of kA followed by a long (critically damped) decline in the tens
of microseconds time scale [99, 100].
Some of the first attempts to produce fast-rising currents with non-reversing long declines using
inductively-driven circuits failed to improve performance at low capacitor energies in the tens of
joules [101]. However, later, a combination of high-current, long pulses and high capacitor ener-
gies achieved using a PFN, improved thrust efficiency considerably. For example, using a PPT
with PTFE propellant, Kamhawi [102] designed and demonstrated thrust efficiency of 36.4%
and a Isp of 3940 s. The measured current waveforms and thrust efficiencies for the three con-
figurations tested – 1a, 1b and 2 – are depicted in Figs. 9-19 and 9-20, respectively. The main dif-
ferences between the two configurations 1 and 2 were in the electrical transmission line layout;
initial testing with configuration 1 indicated that the transmission line inductance was limiting
the peak discharge current magnitudes, thereby affecting thruster performance. Therefore, the
second iteration, configuration 2, was designed to reduce the external inductance. The differences
between 1a and 1b were in the electrode geometry and material, with the former having twice the
width of the latter. Also, 1a and 1b used Al and Cu electrodes, respectively. The electrical circuit
produced a peak current of 70 kA at 700 J, with rise times in the order of 5 μs and decay times of
about 20 μs, as shown in Fig. 9-19. Kamhawi argued that a more improved transmission line
would increase further efficiency, to the levels observed by Palumbo [87] (with maximum
ηT = 53%) from his testing of high-energy PPTs, because it would achieve an even faster rise
and longer decay times of the current as suggested by the theory. The mass and impulse bits

9.3.2.2
First-principles Idealized Models
Since the early intensive computational efforts described above that used large-scale coupled
ablation-MHD numerical simulations, there have been several attempts to obtain engineering mod-
els that are high-fidelity yet simple enough for practical use in the engineering design cycle. Some
researchers have, in fact, been quite innovative in their approach. For example, Zeng et al. [104]
used statistical methods to model the random degradation of molecular chains in a PTFE propellant
and developed expressions for the mass bit as a function of the ablation energy, the energy required
to break the carbon-carbon bonds and the ratio of the mass that breaks away from the propellant
surface to the total ablated mass. Although the authors recognized that their model may only be
suitable for the propellant and structural parameters of their specific thruster experiment, within
the very limited range of comparisons they reported, the agreement with the measured mass bit was
encouraging. Hossain et al. [105] used machine learning techniques to train a relatively simple elec-
tromechanical model of a LES-6-like PPT, also with some encouraging success. Such models,
though potentially useful for engineering purposes, provided limited insight into the driving phys-
ics of the device and their scaling with controllable parameters.
One of the few analytical investigations of breech-fed, rectangular PPTs that relied on insights
gained from previous experiments and simulations and agreed very well with a wide range of
PPT data was that by P. Mikellides et al. [106]. The theoretical model was based on the hypothesis
that the total ablated mass during a single pulse is released early in the waveform and consists of a
variety of species that expand at different speeds, some of which persist in the chamber after dis-
charge cessation. Hence, as also implied in earlier sections, there is a strong contribution from both
electromagnetic and gas dynamic acceleration. He then solved the magnetohydrodynamic conser-
vation equations imposing quasi-steady, 1-D flow assumptions for a control volume that extends to
the magnetosonic point. This latter condition associated with the magnetosonic point was based on

earlier theoretical and numerical work by Mikellides and Turchi who argued [107] and showed by
numerical simulation [99, 100] that the speed υ of the flow that is electromagnetically accelerated
ultimately reaches the Alfven wave speed:
υA =
B
μ0ρ
9 3-9
where ρ is the mass density of the plasma. This magnetosonic condition, υ∗= υA, is a special case of
the plasma flow speed approaching the phase velocity of a magnetoacoustic wave when the ratio of
the plasma pressure to the magnetic pressure approaches zero. In the limit of high magnetic
Reynolds number, RM = μ0υl/η, with υ, l and η being the flow speed, characteristic length and resis-
tivity, respectively, and when the required ionization energy dominates the change in flow
enthalpy, this flow speed tends to remain fixed and proportional to the Alfven critical speed, that
is, υ∗
uA
ΔH where ΔH is the change in the flow enthalpy.
Under these assumptions, P. Mikellides et al. [106] produced the following expression for the
total ablated mass during the pulse, the ionized portion of which is dominated by internal energy

where w is the electrode (or solid propellant) width, h is the distance between the two electro-

uA = 13.3 km/s and I(t) is the underdamped waveform solution for the current based on constant
electrical elements. A comparison of the theoretical model to a range of experimental data is shown
in Fig. 9-21, depicting agreement within experimental error for almost all thrusters addressed. For
Teflon® PPTs it shows that ablated mass scales with electrode aspect ratio, h/w, and stored energy,
E0 and it is inversely proportional to the total resistance, R.

Development of the theory for the total impulse-bit proceeded by modeling the electromagnetic

cient which can be estimated based on a constant-area isentropic expansion to vacuum as follows
[106]: cf = (1 + γ)(2/1 + γ)γ/γ −1 = 1.255 for γ = 1.3. The stagnation pressure was related to the pro-
pellant’s recession rate by Saint Robert’s Law. Integration of the body forces (Eqs. 9.3-12 and 9.3-13)
over the volume produced the final expression for the total impulse bit,

increases with stored energy and it is inversely proportional to the total resistance R; trends
that have been experimentally established, as shown for the case of the former for example in
Fig. 9-20. Furthermore, the model implies that for a given underdamped LRC circuit, an optimum
electrode aspect ratio and electrode width exist that maximize PPT efficiency.

Pulsed Inductive Thrusters (PIT)
One way to evade the poor propellant utilization associated with the challenges of controlling the
ablation of a solid propellant in pulsed thrusters is to provide the propellant in gaseous form,
through controlled injections. In this section, we discuss a different class of pulsed electromagnetic
accelerators in which the plasma is created by inductive breakdown of a layer of gas that is tran-
siently “puffed” onto the surface of a flat spiral induction coil, as shown in Fig. 9-23 (left). At the
instant of optimum placement of the propellant along the inductor cover-glass ring, energy stored
in a bank of capacitors is released into the induction coil. The induced azimuthal electric field

produces rapid ionization of the gas, and establishes a flat ring of current that provides a piston
against which the rising magnetic field acts, entraining and ionizing the balance of the propellant,
and ejecting it along the thruster axis in Fig. 9-23 (right). That is, the resulting plasma current ring is
repelled away from the coil by the J × B force that arises from the interaction between the radial
magnetic field and the azimuthal plasma current. Such inductive acceleration circumvents the need
for conventional electrodes and, in turn, the known lifetime limitations associated with their ero-
sion. Also, since the plasma is lifted away from the coil surface early in the current pulse, thermal
loads to the accelerator structure are manageable. This electrodeless operation, along with
its potential to throttle over a range of thrust and Isp at constant power and almost constant
efficiency (as it will be shown later in the chapter), and its use of plentiful, cheap and potentially
in situ- replenishable propellants, have served as the impetus behind that decades-long research
and development of this type of thruster.
The first laboratory application to embody this type of inductive acceleration was invented at
Thompson Ramo Wooldridge Inc. (TRW) in the early 1960s. The laboratory investigations of
the PIT at TRW were led by Dailey and Lovberg in the late 1960s and 1970s [109–113], and con-
tinued intermittently at Northrop Grumman Space Technology in the 1980s and 1990s [114–120].
For the interested reader, a comprehensive summary of the PIT’s early development history is also
provided in a review article by Polzin [121]. Through several iterations of the PIT, these efforts pro-
duced the Mark (Mk) V, the best-performing version of this thruster thus far [118]. In the early
2000s, a renewed interest in high-power electric propulsion for lunar and Mars cargo missions
[122, 123] allowed further development that focused mostly on thruster components [124, 125].
These efforts were also accompanied by new theoretical investigations that now included more rig-
orous analytical modeling and the first comprehensive MHD 2-D numerical simulations of this type
of thruster [126–129].
The PIT is relatively heavy and necessarily large due to the nature of its propellant puff technol-
ogy and the electrical circuitry that enables pulsed operation at high voltages. Early idealized mod-
eling also suggested that efficiency would improve substantially with thruster size [130]. For
example, the electrical coil used in the PIT MkV was configured as parallel sets of windings forming
a Marx-generator coil topology that was approximately 1 m in diameter. As a consequence of its size
and weight, the thruster is best suited for high-power interplanetary missions. For reference, in
early mission application studies, a 1-m diameter MkV thruster was estimated to carry a mass
in excess of 100 kg and, if operated with a 105-h lifetime at an average power of 20 kW, its specific
mass would be 8 kg/kW at a pulse repetition rate of approximately 6 Hz [118]. A wider range of
thruster specifications and mission applications can be found in [119, 122, 123].
In addition to its relatively high mass and size, this type of accelerator is also challenged by the
complexities associated with achieving efficient conversion of the input electric energy to propul-
sive work. In particular, motion of the plasma current ring (or sheet) away from the coil ring decou-
ples them rapidly, so the design of the accelerator must be such that most of the stored energy is
deposited to the plasma before this decoupling occurs. Also, the timing of the propellant breakdown
relative to the applied current pulse is critical since, if such breakdown is delayed, energy will be lost
irreversibly to the external circuit. Using a separate mechanism to ionize the gas before the appli-
cation of the pulse may offer some mitigation of this effect and was a primary motivation for the
design of a more recent inductive accelerator called the Faraday Accelerator with Radiofrequency
Assisted Discharge (FARAD) [131, 132]. In this configuration the plasma acceleration is produced
inductively as in the PIT. But unlike the PIT, FARAD also employed a separate radiofrequency
(RF)-assisted pre-ionization stage that allowed for the formation of the inductive current sheet
at much lower discharge energies and voltages. This advantage, however, came at the expense
396
9 Electromagnetic Thrusters

of the added complexity associated with incorporating an RF plasma source and applied magnetic
field to produce and guide the plasma onto the face of the inductive coil [133]. The coil for this
accelerator was similar to the PIT’s Marx-type configuration but smaller, with an outer diameter
of 0.2 m. Performance optimization however remained beyond the scope of that first proof-of-
concept effort.
Finally, even though inductive acceleration eliminates concerns associated with conventional
electrode erosion, there are other practical challenges that can limit the life of the thruster. These
are mainly associated with its pulsed operation, namely, the life of the electrical switches and the
propellant injection valves. For example, the MkV pulsed configuration employed spark gap
switches with lifetime in the order of 105 pulses, which would only last less than 5 h at 6 Hz of rep-
etition rate. Newer switch and valve technologies, however, have been proposed as potential miti-
gations such as solid-state switches (thyristors), long-life poppet valve designs [124, 125] and/or the
use of long-life materials for the valves like polycrystalline thermoplastics (e.g. Polyetheretherke-
tone). The solid-state switches have also been proposed as potential candidates for improving
thruster efficiency, specifically, by using them to turn off the current pulse before it reverses sign
thereby reducing energy losses from the LRC ringdown. Finally, since the current sheet is accel-
erated away from the coils it seems implausible that a sufficient flux of energetic ions can be created
and directed towards the coils to cause any damage. Hence, lifetime risks associated with conven-
tional erosion of the coils appears to be marginally low. Nevertheless, such low risk must be demon-
strated in the laboratory through sufficiently long wear tests. It is worth mentioning here that the
above-mentioned variants of the PIT were never tested continuously for hundreds of thousands of
pulses or more to demonstrate marginal to no damage of the inductive coils.
9.4.1
Thruster Performance
The PIT MkV remains today the state of the art in performance for this type of electromagnetic
thruster. We, therefore, summarize some of the most salient results from the early laboratory inves-
tigations of this version of the thruster. The pulsed nature of its operation requires the same
approach in defining performance as that described in Section 9.3 for the ablative PPT. Therefore,
Eqs. 9.3-2–9.3-5 apply here as well so we will not repeat them.
As in the ablative PPT, a typical laboratory test of the PIT will produce a measurement of the
impulse bit (Ib) when the thruster is operated at a given total energy E0 associated with the electrical
circuit’s capacitance and charging voltage. Unlike the ablative PPT, the mass bit (mb) is well con-
trolled through the injection mechanism of the (gaseous) propellant and is therefore known. The
MkV employed a fast-opening solenoid valve, located on the axis of the coil and just above its plane.
The valve releases the contents of a small, high-pressure plenum chamber into a radial supersonic
nozzle, having a cylindrical aperture of 0.25 m radius and 0.025 m height. It is worth pointing out
that the proper initial deposition of the propellant gas over the face of the coil is one of the most
difficult technical challenges in achieving efficient operation with this thruster. Any gap between
the initial plasma breakdown and the coil will produce a parasitic inductance which will degrade
efficiency. If the gas layer is too thick, then snowplow losses will occur through most of the stroke,
which will also reduce efficiency. With knowledge of Ib, mb, and E0, the specific impulse (Isp) and
thruster efficiency (ηT) are determined using Eqs. 9.3-4 and 9.3-5. respectively.
Two versions of the PIT MkV were in fact tested and only in single-pulse operation. A first version
called the MkV was designed and tested with a 2000-J capacitor bank. Its upgraded successor, the
PIT MkVa (see Figs. 1.1–1.9 in Chapter 1), used a 4000-J bank and was the more successful design.
Both designs were guided by the investigations of earlier devices in this series, particularly the MkI
9.4 Pulsed Inductive Thrusters (PIT)
397

and MkIV [114]. Rather than using charging voltages in excess of 30 kV, the MkV employed a Marx
connection of its capacitors to allow the total voltage around the coil to be an integer multiple of the
capacitor charging voltage. It used a two-segment Marx connection and was operated up to 32 kV
coil voltage. The MkV capacitors had a total effective capacitance of 4.5 μF whereas the MkVa had
twice that value. Each of the 18 capacitors in the MkVa had a capacitance of 21 μF, and were
charged in the range of 12–16 kV. Thus, the bank at an effective capacitance of 9 μF and total volt-
age of up to 32 kV produced a maximum energy of 4600 J. The total inductance of the circuit was
740 nH.
A first series of tests with the MkV explored the performance of the thruster with several different
propellants, specifically, He, Ar, CO2, NH3 and simulated hydrazine (N2 + 4NH3). Because of its
availability, storability ease of handling and better performance, NH3 was given a greater emphasis
than the other propellants. Performance measurements (from [126, 127] and private communica-
tion with R. Lovberg)] showing the specific impulse Isp and total efficiency ηT as functions of the
specific energy, E0/mb are plotted in Fig. 9-24. For all propellants it was found that Isp increased
with E0/mb. The efficiency also increased with E0/mb when the thruster was operated with NH3 but
remained relatively constant, around 20%, for all other propellants.
The low performance of the MkV was thought to be because of the challenges in consistently
forming a magnetically impermeable current sheet at low discharge energies (as reported in
[121]). Mainly for this reason, the Marx circuit in the MkVa was upgraded to allow operation
at larger discharge energies. This upgrade improved the performance considerably, as shown
in Fig. 9-25. The thruster operating with NH3 achieved the best performance over all previous
versions and propellants tested, with Isp ranging approximately 2000–9000 s and increasing
with E0/mb. Thrust efficiency exceeded 50% and remained fairly constant at energies
E0 ≳3500 J and E0/mb ≳2000 J/mg, producing impulse bits in the range of 0.05–0.12 N-s [128].
The ηT −Isp trend in the improved PIT MkVa was, generally, that efficiency increased with
increasing Isp until a certain critical (low) value of the propellant mass was injected. For even lower
mass bits the efficiency degraded with increasing Isp. The existence of a so-called “critical mass”
will be discussed further in Section 9.4.2. The maximum value of ηT in the measured ηT −Isp char-
acteristics of the thruster was conjectured to represent an optimum match between the transit time
of the plasma to its point of decoupling from the coil ring and the electrical period of the current
waveform. Hydrazine was also tested with the MkVa but the performance was generally found to be
lower compared to NH3 [118]. Before leaving this section, we should note that the PIT tests
described here were performed in a vacuum chamber that was not much larger than the thruster
itself. Therefore, even though the measured trends associated with the microseconds-long single-
pulse operation of this thruster were unlikely to have been affected significantly, facility effects on
thruster performance were never interrogated extensively. Clearly, close attention must be given to
such effects in any future development programs that will consider multi-pulse operation of this
thruster.

Physics and Modeling
9.4.2.1
Numerical Simulations
Because the laboratory work on this type of accelerator was exclusively performed by the TRW
group for the few decades following its invention in the 1960s, it is no surprise that some of the
earliest models and physics insights were produced by that team as well. Indeed, the first attempts
to simulate numerically the acceleration of the plasma sheet in the PIT were reported by Lovberg
and Dailey in the early 1980s [130, 134, 135]. In their first attempt, the electrical circuit components
398
9 Electromagnetic Thrusters

were represented quite accurately but the plasma was modeled simply as a 1-D slab having uniform
density and constant resistivity. The single-current layer formed at the rear of the plasma was taken
to be a thinner uniform slab whose thickness was given by classical diffusion scaling [130]. Despite
its simplicity, the model provided several useful insights regarding performance and agreed quite
well with the results of earlier experiments. Of significance was the finding that thruster efficiency
should improve substantially with scale size which led to the experiments with a 1-m diameter
thruster soon thereafter.
The computer model was then upgraded to a more comprehensive 1-D resistive MHD formula-
tion that was also solved numerically to provide the spatiotemporal distributions of plasma kinetic
and magnetic field energies as well as the resistive losses [135]. There were, nevertheless, several
simplifications to the model. Specifically, the plasma was assumed to be isothermal and an empir-
ical relation was used to model the dependence of the resistivity on the current density. Also, the
electrical circuit was not explicitly included in the model; a semiempirical analytical form was used

to specify the magnetic field as a function of time at the insulator. A main finding from this effort
was on the effects of the finite plasma resistivity. Specifically, it was argued that an optimum value
of the resistivity exists for which efficiency is higher than that for ideal MHD acceleration (i.e. zero
resistivity). These early efforts underscored the need for an even more comprehensive resistive-
MHD model of the PIT. Such models came quite a bit later during the renewed interest in high-
power electric propulsion in the early 2000s, at a time when such capabilities had become more
readily available.
The first successful resistive-MHD simulations of the PIT, in 2-D axisymmetric geometry, were
performed by P. Mikellides [127–129] using the MACH2 code [136, 137]. The code is a highly
advanced MHD simulation tool with a long record of successful simulations mostly for pulsed
power and, of course, electromagnetic plasma propulsion applications as already discussed in Sec-
tions 9.2 and 9.3. As we will discuss shortly, of particular significance to the PIT are MACH2’s radi-
ation modeling capabilities. The electrons, ions, and radiation field in MACH2 are treated
separately so the code actually solves up to three energy equations. There are three options for
the radiation field: non-equilibrium radiation diffusion, simple radiation cooling in the optically
thin limit, and equilibrium radiation diffusion in the optically thick limit. Also of importance to

the PIT physics is that the evolution of the magnetic field is prescribed by Maxwell’s induction equa-
tion that includes resistive diffusion. Various models for the plasma resistivity are available, includ-
ing classical resistivity due to coulomb electron-ion collisions as well as electron-neutral collisions.
Finally, in many engineering applications such as the ablative PPT and PIT, the source of magnetic
flux is currents produced from externally applied voltage differentials. For this, MACH2 includes a
variety of circuit models such as LRC, PFN, sine-waveforms, and several others. MACH2, therefore,
offered a unique and most fitting simulation capability for the PIT.
The computed evolution of the mass density in the PIT MkVa operating with NH3 at E0 = 4050 J
and E0/mb = 942 J/mg is depicted in Figs. 9-26 and 9-27. The left plot on Fig. 9-26 shows the

computational domain and mesh with the nozzle and location of propellant mass injection, the
conical pylon and the confining cuff. The right plot shows the computed mass density at time
t = 1 μs during the pulse and few relevant dimensions. The evolution of the mass density for several
microseconds during the pulse is shown in Fig. 9-27. A close look at the distribution at t = 1 μs
suggests a relatively efficient acceleration. Specifically, it is observed that the sheet exhibits an
approximately uniform plasma distribution over the radius, which in turn implies that the axial
distributions are approximately representative of the entire propellant. The neutral gas is entrained
by the accelerating plasma in the expected snowplow fashion.
The distributions at t = 2 μs (Fig. 9-27) show that the radial uniformity of the mass density is still
largely retained as is the efficient coupling between the magnetic flux and the accelerating plasma.
At t = 3 μs the radial uniformity is maintained even though the majority of the plasma sheet has
reached the end of the confining region. By this point, the majority of the propellant has been
entrained by the accelerating sheet and compressed to the highest density. This marks the end
of the “snowplow” phase and the start of the a “slug” phase characterized by acceleration of the
entire propellant mass. At t = 4 μs the plasma is now expanding beyond the confining region.
At this point the simulations predict some decoupling of the magnetic flux and plasma. The results
at later times show the formations of a secondary conduction zone involving a reduced amount of
plasma that is accelerated in a similar snowplow fashion. The calculations also show that the
plasma continues to accelerate beyond the confining region because of expansion and conversion
of enthalpy to kinetic energy [127].
The abovementioned MACH2 simulations have produced the most accurate representation of
the plasma dynamics in the PIT since its invention now over six decades ago. This accuracy has
been demonstrated for a variety of specific energies and propellants, not just for NH3 [126, 127].
Figure 9-28 depicts representative comparisons between the MACH2 simulations and performance
measurements for He, Ar and NH3.
Such model fidelity permits unique insights into processes that drive the performance of this
thruster. Two findings were most notable. First, the higher performance of NH3 compared to all
other propellants tested appeared to be because of negligible radiation losses during operation
with this propellant [127]. The conclusion was reached after simulations with Ar and He that
accounted for radiation losses showed excellent agreement with performance measurements,
whereas the simulations with NH3 neglected such losses but, nevertheless, also produced excellent
agreement with the measurements as shown in Fig. 9-28. The argument about reduced radiation
losses in NH3 is also supported by the values of its mean opacity, which P. Mikellides estimated to
be almost three times lower than that of He [127].
Second, a critical value of the specific energy, ε∗was identified below which thruster operation
remains highly efficient. This implied that energy losses to modes other than kinetic energy are
independent of the propellant mass above a “critical mass” value. In the range of E0/mb < ε∗high
thruster efficiencies can be achieved, 45–50% for NH3, and are independent of the input energy.
When E0/mb > ε∗simulations and experiments showed diminishing efficiency at a rate that
becomes more dramatic at lower discharge energies. The origin and significance of ε∗are discussed
in more detail in the next section.
9.4.2.2
First-principles Idealized Modeling
Collectively, the early simplified models of the PIT [130, 135], the numerous evolutionary labora-
tory investigations ([114, 118, 121] and references therein), and the 2-D numerical simulations that
followed them [126–128], have provided sufficient insight to permit the formulation of an idealized
performance model for this thruster.

elements associated with the plasma remain constant:

In Eq. 9.4-2, all circuit elements retain the same definitions as those provided in Section 9.3 (see

shortly. The solution to the differential Eq. 9.4-1 for the current I(t) yields the familiar waveform of a

9 4-4
Since there is no significant gas dynamic contribution to the impulse bit in this thruster, we have
dropped subscript “EM” from Ib,EM in Eq. 9.3-6 for simplicity. P. Mikellides proposed the following
model to determine L [126]. Referring to the schematic in Fig. 9-29, the induced radial magnetic
field Br is assumed to be uniform in both radial and azimuthal directions, and to diffuse into the
induced current sheet of thickness delta, δ, according to an arbitrary function f that depends only on
the axial direction:
Br z, t = μ0I t
f z
r0 −ri
9 4-5
Although arbitrary in z, function f(z) is subject to the following boundary conditions:
f z = 0 = 1,
f z = 1 = 0 and f z = 1 = 0 where z
z δ . The assumed variation of the
magnetic field in Eq. 9.4-5 allows for a simplification in the determination of the axial electromag-
netic force F (and ultimately L ), namely, that such force is independent of the spatial details asso-
ciated with the diffusion of the magnetic field in the sheet. That is,
F t = L

jθBr dU

which upon integration of the J × B force over the plasma control volume U yields

In Eq. 9.4-6 the azimuthal current density has been determined using Ampere’s law:
Jθ(z,t) = μ0dBr(z,t)/dz.
To complete the performance model the resistance R must also be determined. For that,
P. Mikellides invoked a relatively simple statement of energy conservation as follows [126]:

The parameter ξ in Eq. 9.4-8 is defined as the ratio of all the energy sinks over the input energy E0:
ξ = ELoss
E0
9 4-10
where ELoss represents losses to internal modes of the propellant (ion/neutral, electron heating and
ionization), nonutilized magnetic energy, and radiation dissipation.
In general, the determination of ξ is unamenable to simplified analysis. However, the numer-
ical simulations described in the previous section provided invaluable insight into its determi-
nation. It was found that above a certain critical mass m∗, the fraction ξ was fairly constant and
independent of the input energy and propellant mass bit. On the other hand, when mb < m∗,
ELoss increased exponentially leading to rapid degradation of the efficiency. The processes in
which a significant fraction of the input energy is deposited to internal energy modes (most
notably to ionization) once the plasma reaches a certain critical speed may be familiar to the
reader because it was invoked previously in reference to related processes in other electromag-
netic thrusters such as the MPD and ablative PPT. P. Mikellides argued a similar limiting proc-
ess occurs in the PIT at low mass bits whereby a large fraction of the input energy is deposited to
internal modes when that energy becomes comparable to the propellant ionization energy, leav-
ing negligible amount for conversion to kinetic energy of the plasma [126]. This then allowed
the following model for ξ:
ξ = ξ0 + 1 −ξ0 e −mb m∗
9 4-11
where the critical mass m∗associated with the ionization of the propellant has been defined as
m∗= ME0
i
Qi
9 4-12
The denominator on the right-hand side of Eq. 9.4-12 denotes the sum of the ionization energy Q
[J/mol] over all ionization energy levels i, and M [kg/mol] is the molecular weight of the propel-
lant. A corresponding critical specific energy can also be defined as ε∗= E0/m∗. In Eq. 9.4-11, ξ0 is
the asymptotic value of the energy fraction ξ as mb
∞(or as E0/mb
0), and is a function of the
propellant. Importantly, as it is also implied by Eqs. 9.4-11 and 9.4-12, ξ0 represents all energy losses
except that associated with ionization. It is, therefore, a challenging quantity to determine without
measurement or simulation. MACH2 simulations provided guidance on how this value varies with
propellant mass. An example is shown for He at E0 = 1296 J in Fig. 9-30, which compares the idea-
lized model for the energy fraction ξ Eq. 9.4-11 with numerical simulations that account for all con-
tributions in ELoss, not just ionization. The comparison confirms the dominance of ionization losses
below the critical mass m∗and quantifies the value of ξ0 to be approximately 0.75 [126]. Further
insight on ξ0 is provided below as the idealized performance model is completed and the results
are combined with those from the numerical simulations.
9.4 Pulsed Inductive Thrusters (PIT)

With the introduction of ξ in Eq. 9.4-11 we can now use Eqs. 9.4-8 and 9.4-9 to express the total
resistance R as follows:
R =
RE +
RE + 1 −ξ
2mb E0L 2
2 1 −ξ
9 4-13
which, in turn, allows for the determination of the impulse bit from Eq. 9.4-4. The thrust efficiency
may then also be calculated using Eq. 9.3-5.
The idealized model results are compared with performance measurements in Fig. 9-31 for a vari-
ety of propellants and specific energies. For all propellants investigated in this analysis, the effective
exhaust speed g0Isp is predicted quite well when a constant value for ξ0 is used in the model. This
implies that at the lower energies the authors investigated in [126] (E0< 1764 J), the fraction of the
total available energy expended in sinks other than ionization is independent of the specific energy
when mb > m∗. Based on Fig. 9-31 (and additional results reported in [126]), ξ0 was also found to be
independent of the propellant type since good agreement with the measurements was attained
using the same value (ξ0 = 0.77) for all three propellants (He, Ar, and CO2). Also, the computed
efficiency from the idealized model did not exceed 23% for these propellants. The exception was
found to be NH3 which required a lower value, ξ0 = 0.69, to capture the measured trend for g0Isp
in the energy range 900–1764 J [126]. With this value of ξ0, the maximum efficiency was predicted
by the model to be 31% for NH3, which is consistent with the measurements, as shown in Fig. 9-24
(bottom). Considering the results collectively, the model predictions are also consistent with the
observed trends on the effect of different propellants on thrust efficiency; they showed that efficiency
is lower for He, Ar, and CO2 than for NH3, regardless of propellant mass and energy. Further analysis
of the results suggested that the lower value of ξ0 responsible for the superior performance of NH3
was because of lower radiation losses in this propellant compared to the other propellants.
The analysis discussed above was performed in the energy range of the PIT MkV (namely
E0<2000 J), which tested the performance of several propellants. At the higher energies of the MkVa,
which focused mostly on NH3, the electrical circuit model in the MACH2 simulations had to be
advanced to include the effects of the time-dependent plasma resistance and inductance in the cal-
culation of the current waveform. The results for a range of energies and propellant masses are
reported in [128] but a representative set of comparisons has already been shown in Fig. 9-24 (bottom).

These high-energy PIT simulations confirmed the existence of a critical mass below which efficiency
begins to degrade because of increased deposition of the available energy to ionization. They also
revealed that at higher energies, ξ is less amenable to the idealized modeling discussed above
(per Eq. 9.4-11) as additional processes, such as incomplete gas breakdown and azimuthal and radial
nonuniformities, become important when the thruster is operated beyond the critical specific energy
value ε∗.
In fact, the preservation of the sheets’ uniformity was a main motivation behind a variant of the
FARAD thruster mentioned earlier [131, 132] in which the planar coil was replaced by a conical
arrangement. The variant appropriately called Conical Theta Pinch (CTP) FARAD [133, 138] aimed
at producing a coil geometry that more closely aligned with the natural path of the injected pro-
pellant thereby, potentially, better preserving its uniformity while also enabling easier pre-
ionization. A development and testing program at NASA MSFC continued investigations of both
the planar and conical variants of this thruster that culminated in 2012 in the continuous operation
of the CTP at a repetition rate of 5 Hz. At a charging voltage of a 40-μF bank to 5 kV, the thruster was
operated at a power of 2.5 kW which, to the authors’ knowledge [139], is over an order of magnitude
greater than any previous operation of a pulsed plasma thruster.

Future Directions in Electric Propulsion
Hall thrusters and ion thrusters are now routinely used to provide in-space propulsion in
Earth-orbiting satellites and deep space science missions. These two types of thrusters are consid-
ered mature flight technologies. However, research and development efforts on them continue
worldwide primarily aimed at scaling to higher power levels (>10 kW) and lower power levels
(<1 kW), extending life and throughput, understanding stability and oscillations, and improving
modeling and simulation capabilities. Examples of some additional investigation activities on these
types of thrusters are provided below. Electromagnetic thrusters also have an extensive history of
research and development and some emerging flight experience. Several examples of the ongoing
activities in electromagnetic thruster development are also given below.
Other electric thruster concepts that do not have flight heritage to date are of interest to discuss
briefly to illustrate research and development directions in the field. Reviews of new concepts and
prospects for electric thrusters have been recently published by Levchenko et al. [1–3]. A review of
thruster technologies and paths toward maturation of existing thrusters and new concepts was also
recently published by Dale et al. [4]. Examples of some of these thruster concepts are provided in
this chapter and the others can be found in the references in these reviews. Again, we will ignore
electrothermal thrusters as mature technology with relatively low performance for future space
propulsion applications, and also not discuss micropropulsion as it is too extensive a field to be
covered sufficiently in this book.
10.1
Hall Thruster Developments
Hall thrusters have emerged as the most commonly flown electric thrusters worldwide due to the
recent emphasis on the new communications constellations and Earth observing spacecraft.
Conventional Hall thrusters are now flying routinely in the power range of 0.1–5 kW using both
xenon and krypton propellants. Magnetically shielded Hall thrusters are now in development
for use in the next generation of EP flight systems. Investigations on simple improvements and
novel innovations to Hall thrusters continue at universities and laboratories worldwide.
10.1.1
Alternative Propellants
Although xenon has historically been the most commonly used propellant in Hall thrusters, the
increasing cost and concerns about the availability of xenon has spurred use and development
of alternative propellants. Fortunately, Hall thrusters will run on nearly any propellant if properly

configured and operated at the right temperature consistent with the propellant properties. Krypton
has emerged as the most commonly used alternative propellant in now thousands of Hall thrusters
on communications satellites. A recent review [5] of the performance changes with krypton com-
pared to xenon in a conventional Hall thruster showed both the performance benefits of krypton
(primarily higher Isp associated with the lower atom mass) with the detriments of lower thrust and
efficiency (primarily because of the lower mass utilization efficiency that results from higher atom
velocity in the channel, higher ionization potential and lower ionization cross section). Issues with
higher oscillation levels and modified stability limits have also been identified when using krypton.
These differences and potential mitigation techniques are areas of active research at this time.
Iodine has long been considered an attractive alternative propellant for Hall thrusters compared
to xenon [6] because of its similar mass and ionization potential, and its liquid state at room tem-
perature for storage and launch considerations. Experiments have shown good performance for
iodine propellants in Hall thrusters, but also difficulties associated with the corrosive nature of
iodine when in contact with thruster or spacecraft components. Compatible cathode technology
is also an issue with iodine propellant. Other metal propellants such as magnesium and zinc have
been investigated [7–9] in Hall thrusters, and bismuth has been tested in Hall thrusters in the
United States [10, 11] and reported to be used Russian [12] TAL thrusters. In addition, other gas-
eous propellants such as carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, helium,
air, and vaporized water/ice associated with potential use from in-situ resource utilization from
planets, comets and asteroids have been investigated [13]. All these alternative propellants can have
both advantages in ionization characteristics and storage capabilities in space, and disadvantages in
ionization rates, sputtering, surface chemistry, and mass utilization that require specialized design
of the Hall thruster.
10.1.2
Nested Channel Hall Thrusters for Higher Power
As described in the previous chapters on Hall thrusters, scaling to higher power levels is con-
strained by the requirements on the magnetic field strength and shape achievable in a given dis-
charge channel width, and on the maximum ion current density achievable in the Hall thruster
design. Discharge channels cannot be made arbitrarily wide to produce higher total power capa-
bility without serious compromises in the magnetic field magnitude and the coil power required
to produce that field. Increasing the power level requires increasing the channel diameter to pro-
duce more plasma area, but eventually the thruster becomes just a large ring with unutilized area
toward the center. Therefore, an attractive path toward higher total power is to use multiple annu-
lar discharge channels in a nested configuration. This not only provides the capability to operate at
a higher total power level, but to also operate the channels independently and so provides a very
wide throttling range for the thruster.
The first reported development and testing at total power levels up to 6 kW of a two-channel Hall
thruster called the X2 was by Liang and Gallimore [14]. The operation of this conventional dis-
charge channel magnetic field geometry was explored in early simulations at Michigan [15],
and interactions between the nested discharge channels was later investigated to understand
the coupling and performance [16]. The two-channel nested design was improved to provide total
power levels in excess of 30 kW and include magnetic shielding for long discharge channel life in
the N30 thruster shown in Figure 10-1 by Cusson [17].
Three channel nested Hall thrusters have also been pursued to demonstrate significantly higher
power capability. The three-ring X3 Hall thruster [18, 19] shown in Figure 10-2 demonstrated
418
10 Future Directions in Electric Propulsion

operation at 100 kW of total discharge power
in xenon [20] in testing at the University of
Michigan and at NASA GRC. The large size of
this thruster made fabrication of boron nitride
walls problematic and produced several break-
down and cracking failures in test. Fortunately,
the next generation of this thruster is planned to
use magnetic shielding to extend the thruster life,
and so can also use non-ceramic discharge cham-
ber walls (such as graphite) [21] that are easier to
fabricate and robust to the thermal and plasma
bombardment environment in the Hall thruster
at very high discharge powers.
The X3 thruster also utilized a LaB6 hollow
cathode specifically designed and fabricated at
JPL [22] to operate in the X3 thruster at discharge
currents in excess of 250 A. The cathode also
incorporated gas injectors in the near-cathode
plume [23] to damp discharge oscillations and
reduce energetic ion generation that are a signif-
icant problem at discharge currents in excess of
100 A. An added benefit of the cathode-plume
gas injectors is to reduce the total cathode flow
required to stably operate the thruster [24]. Cath-
ode flow fractions below 5% of the anode flow
were achieved, increasing the overall thruster
efficiency by several percent. Higher power Hall
thrusters will require hollow cathodes capable
of even higher discharge currents and must
develop additional techniques to minimize dis-
charge oscillations in the cathode plume that
generate energetic ions.

testing of a two-channel TAL thruster at discharge
powers up to 1 kW. Additional research on config-
urations of the magnetic field and anode are
planned.
10.1.3
Double Stage Ionization and Acceleration Regions
Hall thrusters normally use an E × B discharge to perform both ionization and acceleration of the
propellant gas in the discharge channel. These functions can be separated to potentially improve
the performance by reducing the discharge cost of the ion production and decoupling the thrust and

Isp relationship typically found in Hall thrusters.
First attempts utilized biased electrodes placed on
the discharge chamber wall [26] to modify the local
electric field and change the ion losses to the wall in
the ionization region. Another concept, shown in
Figure 10-3, is the Double Stage Hall thruster [27]
where the ionization region is physically separated
from the transverse magnetic field acceleration
region at the thruster exit. The plasma is produced
near the anode region using an rf coil configured
either as an inductive or helicon plasma source.
This concept permits operation at either high thrust
or high specific impulse (Isp) for a given power into
the discharge region by changing the ionization rate
independent of the acceleration potential, providing
a more versatile design that can be used for a variety
of maneuvers in space. Modeling of the thruster
performance has been published [27], and initial
experiments on hardware using a helicon plasma
source in the Hall thruster have shown some pro-
pellant utilization improvements associated with
the helicon plasma generation, but slight perfor-
mance decrease associated with the additional rf
power [28]. Other configurations and ionization
techniques are being pursued at various labora-
tories to reduce the ionization cost and improve
the overall thruster performance.
10.1.4
Multipole Magnetic Fields in Hall
Thrusters
Another technique to make the ionization region
separate from the acceleration region is to change
the magnetic field topology. Traditional Hall thrusters use a single magnetic pole that produces
a peak in the local transverse magnetic field near the exit plane. Ding reports [29] studies of a Hall
thruster configuration with multiple permanent magnetic rings to form two magnetic peaks in the
discharge channel. Figure 10-4 shows a schematic representation of one version of this concept with
two permanent magnet rings and two electrodes for the anode and an intermediate electrode near
the exit plane. This configuration is intended to reduce the power deposition on the thruster wall
and decrease the wall erosion rate, and increases the ionization rate upstream of the exit plane.
Experimental investigations of this novel geometry using different anode configurations [30] in
a 200-W class Hall thruster and with different magnetic configurations are continuing [31].
Other magnetic field configurations that use a number of cusp fields or additional magnetic poles
are also possible. For example, the HEMP (High Efficiency Multi-Stage) thruster [32] uses multiple
permanent magnet rings around a coaxial channel to separate the anode from the external hollow
cathode. A variation on this design is the Divergent Cusped-Field thruster [33] that uses a conical
discharge chamber lined by permanent magnet rings. Likewise, the Magnetic Octupole Plasma

Thruster (MOPT) [34] replaces the conventional
magnetic circuit of a Hall thruster with an octupole
magnetic field generated by eight permanent mag-
nets and a magnet yoke. All these configurations
attempt to vary the magnetic field configuration to
improve the performance and life of the thruster,
and additional geometries are conceivable for inves-
tigations going forward.
10.2
Ion Thruster Developments
Ion thrusters are a very mature electric propulsion
technology with significant flight heritage using
DC discharge, Kaufman and microwave plasma gen-
erator configurations. Development is ongoing for rf
ion thrusters and larger scale microwave ion thrus-
ters. Work also continues on improving the perfor-
mance and life of the accelerator grids and the
utilization of alternative propellants. These will be
described briefly below.
10.2.1
Alternative Propellants
While xenon is the standard propellant used in flight ion thrusters as of now, ion thrusters will run
on nearly any gaseous propellant that the thruster materials are compatible with. Alternative
propellants, specifically liquid metals, were used in the original development and flights of ion
thrusters. The very first ion thruster utilized cesium as the propellant [35], and the first
electron-bombardment ion thruster used mercury as the propellant [36]. The first flight of ion
thrusters on SERT-1 [37] carried both these cesium and mercury ion thrusters. Xenon emerged
in the early 1980s because of its high mass, low ionization potential, inert gas properties that min-
imize spacecraft interactions, and high-density storage capability on the spacecraft.
Surveys of potential propellants describing their physical properties, (ionization potential,
vaporization temperature, etc.) performance in the thruster, storage in the spacecraft, impacts
on flow controller and PPU, cathode operation, plume-spacecraft interactions, toxicity, and
thruster lifetime have been previously published [38, 39]. The most viable alternative propellant
to xenon is likely krypton. Iodine and mercury were found to have high performance, but were
discounted in that study because of their compatibility issues, especially in terms of spacecraft
contamination, corrosion and toxicity. In addition, a 2021 United Nations provision banned
the use of mercury in spacecraft propellant [40] over health hazard concerns, and environmental
cleanup of mercury contaminated test facilities on the ground has been a significant issue for fur-
ther use of this material. Nevertheless, iodine is still being pursued as an ion thruster propellant,
especially for Earth-orbiting CubeSat and SmallSat thrusters [41]. A small rf-ion thruster using
iodine propellant and operating at up to 65 W of total power was recently launched into a 480 km
orbit and demonstrated operation in space [42]. Iodine thrusters are being scaled to higher power
and performance levels for other applications. Other propellants described in these surveys
are being pursued in many laboratories, and investigations of the modifications needed to the

thrusters to accommodate those propellants and optimize the thruster performance is an active
area of research and development.
10.2.2
Grid Systems for High Isp
The accelerator grids for ion thrusters have historically been made of molybdenum because of its
machineability, high strength to survive launch loads and high voltage standoff capability. A large
effort was made about 20 years ago to develop alternative grid materials such as titanium, graphite,
carbon-carbon composite and pyrolytic graphite that have longer life because of lower sputtering
rates from ion bombardment that occurs within the grid structure. This is necessary to operate the
grids at higher voltages (over 2 kV) required to obtain Isp of over 4000 s. The carbon-based grid
materials all have low sputtering yields compared to molybdenum, but poorer high voltage standoff
and robustness to arc formation [43]. Nevertheless, carbon-carbon composite grids were success-
fully developed for the NEXIS ion thruster [44] that operated at beam voltages up to 6.5 kV produ-
cing a Isp as high as 8500 s and a total power up to 28 kW.
As described in Chapter 6, flight ion accelerators have historically used two and three grid sys-
tems. These consist of the “screen” grid that is near the discharge chamber plasma potential and
forms the beamlets of ions to be accelerated, the negatively biased “accel” grid that provides the
high electric field for accelerating the ions, and sometimes the “decel” grid biased at near the
ion beam potential that protects the accel grid from backstreaming ion bombardment and sputter-
ing. Accelerator systems with combined grid materials of a relatively thick graphite for the accel
grid for strength and low sputtering yield, and a thin molybdenum grid for the screen grid for high
strength and transparency have been developed to produce high Isp with long life. The T6 Kaufman
thruster [45] used in the BepiColombo mission [46] has a 2 kV accelerator system with the com-
bined moly-graphite grid materials produce a Isp of about 4000 s at a power of 4.5 kW. However,
scaling of pure graphite grids to larger diameters is problematic structurally to survive launch loads,
and the thin molybdenum screen grids limit the thruster life and throughput capabilities from sput-
tering of the grid by low energy ions from the discharge chamber. Alternative grid materials such as
carbon-based electrodes or others, combined with the introduction of additive manufacturing tech-
niques [47], are needed in two-and three-grid systems to achieve higher total power at high Isp.
Another technique to obtain high Isp (and higher power levels) is to increase the number of accel-
erator grids. Dual-stage four-grid ion thrusters were first proposed [48] based on the original devel-
opment of four-grid accelerator systems for neutral beam injectors used in fusion research [49].
Initial experiments [50] demonstrated total acceleration potentials of up to 30 kV producing a
Isp up to 15,000 s. This work also demonstrated an order of magnitude increase in the beam power
density compared to conventional two- to three-grid system thrusters, enabli1qng ion thrusters
with total power levels over 100 kW. Work is continuing on the development of four-grid ion thrus-
ters [51] with recent experiments investigating the decoupling of the ion extraction from the dis-
charge plasma from the ion acceleration to high voltage of the dual-stage ion four-grid optical
system.
10.3
Helicon Thruster Development
Helicon thrusters use rf fields from a specially designed antenna around a cylindrical ceramic
chamber to launch helicon waves in the resultant plasma that ionize and heat propellant gas
injected from one end. The device requires a strong axial magnetic field, which is produced by
422
10 Future Directions in Electric Propulsion

either solenoids, superconducting magnets, or permanent magnets. The plasma generated in the
source region flows along the magnetic field lines out of the thruster, and the ions are accel-
erated by axial ambipolar fields [52], the generation of free-standing double layers [53], and
the diverging field magnetic nozzle [54] at the exit. Helicon thrusters are considered electroless
(no grids or anode/cathode electrodes in contact with the plasma), and do not require a neu-
tralizer cathode.
Figure 10-5 shows a simplified schematic of a helicon thruster (left) and a photograph of labo-
ratory helicon thruster [55] (right) with the solenoid coils, antenna structure and plasma plume.
A comprehensive review of helicon thruster technology and physics was recently published by
Takahashi [55], and the plume structure and ion acceleration mechanisms described by Williams
[56]. Helicon thrusters have been characterized by lower Isp and efficiency than ion and Hall thrus-
ters, but recent work optimizing the magnetic field configuration in the helicon source region and
the magnetic nozzle at the exit have increased the efficiency to levels approaching 30% [57].
Research and development continue on the helicon plasma source design, the ion acceleration
physics for higher Isp, reducing the losses in the solenoids and rf generator, improving the magnetic
nozzle design, and understanding the mechanisms for detachment of the plasma from the mag-
netic field.
The problem with lower Isp from helicon plasma thrusters has been solved by the development
of the Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR®) [58]. Figure 10-6 shows a
schematic layout of the VASIMR® thruster that has a high-density helicon plasma source and an
ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) section. The plasma produced by the helicon source is
guided by the 1-to-2 T magnetic field from an external superconducting magnet to the ICRH
section where the ions are heated in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field lines.
The increased perpendicular energy of the ions is converted into the axial energy as the magnetic
field expands in the magnetic nozzle [59]. The separate helicon and ICRH sections enable the
thrust and Isp to be varied independently, which can be useful in the mission trajectory pla-
nning. The VASMIR® system has no physical material electrodes in contact with the plasma,
enabling longer life because the ion erosion is minimized. A thruster efficiency of 72% has been
demonstrated [60] using argon propellant with a specific impulse of 4880 s when operated at a
total coupled RF power of 200 kW. Development of the VX-200 thruster continues including
using krypton propellant, which is anticipated to yield improved thrust-to-power ratios and a
higher thruster efficiency at lower Isp values.

10.4
Magnetic Field Dependent Thrusters
There is significant interest in thruster concepts that manipulate magnetic fields to produce ion
acceleration. This includes rotating magnetic fields originating from reversed field configurations
developed in the nuclear fusion community where similar physics is used to magnetically confine
plasma for fusion purposes. There is also research and development on continuous induction-
acceleration thrusters and thrusters that use ion acceleration from magnet reconnection. These will
be described briefly in this section.
10.4.1
Rotating Magnetic Field (RMF) Thrusters
Rotating magnetic field (RMF) thrusters are a propulsion application of field-reversed configura-
tions (Rotamak-FRC) and spherical tokamaks (Rotamak-ST) developed in the fusion community
[61]. They work by inducing an azimuthal current by means of a rotating magnetic field in a seed
plasma produced by rf coils or helicon sources [62–65]. The rotating magnetic field is usually gen-
erated using sets of saddle coil antennas around the thruster body, as illustrated in Figure 10-7.
Each of these forms a Helmholtz pair surrounding the thruster and oriented in either the x or y
direction, with the z direction oriented along the thruster’s axis. By injecting sinewave currents into
each antenna 90 out of phase, a magnetic field is generated which effectively rotates in the plane
transverse to the thruster’s central axis [62]. Given a sufficiently strong RMF magnitude, this causes

ionization by electrons in the seed plasma and generates the azimuthal current [66]. This current
can interact via the Lorentz force with the radial component of an applied bias field generated by
external electromagnets. Additionally, if conductive structural elements such as flux conservers or
the bias magnets themselves are present, the rapid rise of plasma current will induce secondary
transient currents in those structures via mutual inductance, and the plasma slug (called a “plas-
moid”) will be repelled from those structures via the Lorentz force. The force from direct interaction
with the bias magnet scales linearly with plasma current, and force owing to interaction with the
secondary induced currents in nearby structures goes quadratically with plasma current. However,
these forces together do not account for directly measured thrust, indicating that thermal effects
may be at play, generating force in a similar manner as a magnetic nozzle using the applied mag-
netic field [67].
At present, the RMF thruster remains an inefficient device [62] likely due to losses in the plasma
at the high plasma density (>1019 m−3) throughout the plasma volume. There is development is
aimed at producing steady state operation at lower plasma densities, which will reduce ionization
and radiation losses to boost the efficiency. This will also allow a proportionally lower RMF current
amplitude and make operation possible at similar power levels. In this mode, it is expected that the
thruster will behave more like an applied-field MPD thruster with the benefit of no plasma-wetted
electrodes.
10.4.2
Magnetic Induction Plasma Thrusters
The Magnetic Induction Plasma Engine (MIPE) is a 15-kW class RF-based magnetic induction
thruster [68] that in contrast to the pulsed inductive thruster described in Chapter 9 is capable
of steady-state operation. In the thruster, multiple phased-driven coils, similar in concept to a linear
induction motor, are wound around an insulating cylindrical tube, as shown in Figure 10-8. The
coils are excited with delayed phases to create an axially propagating magnetic field. The plasma
breaks down because of the electrostatic fields from the coils, and a plasma current is then driven by

magnetic induction transformer action. The Lorentz force is exerted on the plasma current by the
traveling magnetic field wave. The magnetic force on the current is exerted on the electrons, which
drag the ions with them electrostatically to maintain charge neutrality and generate thrust.
Thruster efficiencies up to 37%, Isp up to 2300 s, and thrust up to 100 mN were measured in lab-
oratory testing, although not simultaneously. Research continues on improving the simultaneous
thruster performance and expanding the capabilities of this novel approach.
10.4.3
Magnetic Reconnection Thrusters
Magnetic reconnection is one of the primary drivers of particle acceleration processes in space and
astrophysical plasmas by conversion of magnetic energy into charged particle thermal and kinetic
energy [69–71]. Magnetic reconnection has been studied with respect to solar flares [72], fusion-
research tokamaks [73, 74], and in laboratory plasmas [75, 76].
Magnetic reconnection occurs in the sudden change in the topology of a magnetic field that con-
verts the energy stored into the magnetic field into energetic charged particles. This mechanism
[71] is responsible for the plasma acceleration of interest for thruster applications. The energy
release can occur from annihilation and creation of magnetic flux, expansion and compression
of the magnetic field, and contraction or stretching of curved magnetic field lines. One of the issues
for propulsion is that the energy release in terms of plasma acceleration is nearly symmetric from
the event location [76], which eliminates net thrust. An asymmetric field geometry or plasma den-
sity profile is then needed to generate net thrust. Magnetic reconnection thruster concepts for use in
space propulsion systems have been proposed based on results from fully kinetic modeling [77] and
MHD simulations [78]. Initial experimental results of a magnetic reconnection thruster [79]
demonstrated ion acceleration from an argon plasma with a calculated velocity corresponding
to an Isp of 860 s. Although magnetic reconnection plasma acceleration has been recognized for
decades, research on how to use this mechanism in a thruster is relatively new and expanding
worldwide.

10 Future Directions in Electric Propulsion

10.5
Laser-Based Propulsion
Electromagnetic radiation can provide thrust for spacecraft for interplanetary and interstellar
missions [3]. Laser-based propulsion concepts are an active area of research because of the
potential for both high power and high Isp. There are basically three viable laser-based
propulsion concepts:
• Laser radiation pressure acceleration
• Laser ablation
• Laser driven collisionless shock acceleration of ions
Laser radiation pressure propulsion uses photon pressure beamed from an Earth-based or near-
Earth orbiting laser to accelerate the spacecraft. An example of this system is the Starshot Initiative
that set a goal of sending a spacecraft beyond our Solar System to a nearby star within the next half-
century using laser-based propulsion. Starshot proposed an ultralight spacecraft design that is accel-
erated by laser radiation pressure from an Earth-based source on a lightsail [80]. A related concept is
to use ultrasmall spacecraft called “Chipsats” equipped with a solar sail that would escape the Solar
System using photon pressure from a laser, travel to the interstellar target, and send back some
telemetry [81]. Lightsails represent a materials challenge to achieve optimum reflectance in a mul-
tilayer structure [82] for high momentum transfer over a very large area while maintaining low
mass. The laser technology is also challenging to achieve the power and pointing accuracy from
the ground or from space required for beaming power to spacecraft for deep space travel.
Propulsion using laser ablation of materials has been investigated since the 1970s [83] when it was
first proposed for Earth-based lasers to propel satellites into orbit. A detailed review was published in
2010 [84]. A high intensity laser pulse hitting a material surface generates several processes [85] such
as production of a surface plasma that expands and ejects ionized particles, expulsion of jet of vapor
from evaporation or sublimation of the surface, and imparting momentum to the surface by reflec-
tion of the laser photons or emission of secondary electrons. The propellant can be with liquid or
solid, both complicated by the delivery requirements of the material to the surface interacting with
the laser beam. However, the potential for low power average consumption using pulsed lasers, and
the possibility of high Isp (>1000 s) and variable thrust controlled by the pulse repetition rate, is
driving continued investigations [86] into new laser-ablation propulsion system.
Laser-driven collisionless shockwaves in a plasma produce significant acceleration of ions
[87, 88]. Measurements of the acceleration of protons and multiply-carbon ions in shockwave
experiments using ultra-short, high peak-power laser pulses are consistent with reflection of par-
ticles off the moving potential of a shock front in the plasma at near the critical plasma density.
Gaseous hydrogen targets driven by intense 10 μm laser pulses have generated ~MeV energy
protons accelerated by the radiation pressure driven shock wave [89]. Experiments using 1 μm
and 10 μm lasers with >1021 W/cm2 produced ion energies well in excess of 1 MeV [87, 90].
Although not configured for thruster applications, these results are promising for the future devel-
opment of high power, high Isp (>10,000 s) propulsion systems.
10.6
Solar Sails
Solar sails are a well-known concept [91–93] that uses radiation from the sun to provide propulsion
without the need for propellant. Owing to the low solar radiation pressure, a solar sail must have a
large area to produce significant amounts of thrust, which mandates a light-weight surface material
10.6 Solar Sails

and support structure. Sails that use photo pressure are made up of reflecting surfaces used to redi-
rect sunlight for the purpose of creating forces for thrust and torques for attitude control, and sep-
arate structures or mechanisms for deploying the sail. Many complex sail shapes and different rigid
and non-rigid support structures have been proposed [91] to satisfy these criteria.
The first spacecraft to successfully demonstrate interplanetary solar sail technology was IKAROS
(Interplanetary Kite-craft Accelerated by Radiation Of the Sun) launched by the Japan Aerospace
Exploration Agency (JAXA) in 2010 [94]. IKAROS used a diagonal spinning square sail with an area
of 196 m2 made of a 7.5-μm thick polyimide with a mass of only 77 g/m2 [95]. IKAROS spent six
months traveling to Venus, and then performed a three-year journey around the Sun [96]. Another
successful solar sail mission was LightSail [97], which was a project to demonstrate controlled
solar sailing within low Earth orbit using a CubeSat. The program consisted of two spacecraft —
LightSail 1 with a mission duration of 25 days and LightSail 2 with a mission duration over 3 years
[98, 99]. A recently launched (2022) solar sail mission is the NASA Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) Scout
[100] intended to demonstrate a controllable CubeSat solar sail spacecraft capable of encountering
near-Earth asteroids. As of this writing, radio contact with the NEA Scout spacecraft has not been
achieved and the mission is feared lost. The next major planned mission is Solar Cruiser, a NASA
mission intended to launch in 2028 and planned to test a very large >1000 m2 solar sail in an artificial
orbit between the Earth and Sun [101].
Challenges for solar sails include developing extremely lightweight deployable materials for the
reflector/membrane surface [102], understanding the structural dynamics both for support of the
membrane and compatibility with the attitude control system of the spacecraft [97], solar sail geom-
etry changes with temperature during the mission affecting the thrust profile, and modeling of the
sail performance [91].
Electric solar-wind sails were invented in 2004 by Janhunen [103] and provide thrust by reflecting
charged solar wind particles using electric fields, thus converting momentum from particles in the
solar wind into propulsion [104]. The pressure associated with charge particles in the solar wind is
over a thousand times lower than the photon pressure, but this difference can be made up by
increasing the size of the much lighter electric sail and taking advantage of the electric fields to
cover more area [105].
The electric sail concept uses conducting wires placed radially around the spacecraft and straigh-
tened by rotation of the spacecraft [105]. The wires are electrically charged to create an electric field,
which extends some tens of meters into the plasma of the surrounding solar wind. Charged particles
are reflected by the electric field much like the photons on a traditional solar sail. The sail is much
lighter than a traditional solar sail because the radius of the sail is determined by the electric field
rather than the wire. An example of an electric sail conceptional design may have 50–100 straigh-
tened wires with a length of about 20 km each. The fundamental mechanism of electric sails,
momentum transfer from steaming ion deflection in a positive sheath, was measured in tests per-
formed at NASA/MSFC (K. H. Wright Jr., personal Communication) and agreed with the analytical
thrust estimates of Jahunen [103]. Research is continuing on sail performance and mission
applications.

Hollow Cathode Discharge Thrusters
Plasma discharges between a hollow cathode and various configurations of the anode, both with
and without applied magnetic fields, have been investigated for nearly 50 years for hollow cathode
development work and plasma source applications. For example, Figure 10-9 shows a hollow
428
10 Future Directions in Electric Propulsion

cathode test setup at JPL with a solenoid coil positioned around it, and coupled to a segmented
anode (left) and a cylindrical anode (right). Various configurations of this setup, with solenoids
around the cathode and/or the anode, different anode geometries and dimensions, and including
plasma diagnostics and ion energy analyzers, were found to generate promising parameters for
thruster applications such as high ionization fractions, high discharge currents and energetic
ion production. Investigations of hollow cathode-based thrusters illuminated the thrust production
mechanisms [106], and experimental work using a T6 hollow cathode with a cylindrical anode pro-
duced thrust levels of over 1 mN at an Isp of 200–1000 s (depending on the flow rate and discharge
voltage) using discharge currents of up to 30 A.
Recently, experiments with various combina-
tions
of
solenoids
and
anodes
positioned
around a central hollow cathode have been
made to investigate the performance as a
thruster [107]. The thrust characteristics of
what is termed “electrostatic-magnetic hybrid
acceleration” have been measured on this
“central–cathode electrostatic thruster (CC–
EST)” shown in Figure 10-10. This device injects
the majority of the propellant though an annu-
lar slit in the ring anode, and features a diver-
ging magnetic field that produces a Lorentz
force on the ions and also acts as a magnetic
nozzle. Both electrostatic and electromagnetic
contributions to the measured thrust were
found [107]. Various combinations of anode
electrodes and magnetic field shapes from per-
manent magnets and solenoids continue to be
investigated to increase the performance of this
thruster concept.

10 Future Directions in Electric Propulsion

Chapter 11
Electric Thruster Plumes and Spacecraft Interactions
11.1
Introduction
Electric propulsion offers advantages for many missions and applications, but like many spacecraft
systems, integration of electric thrusters on spacecraft can present significant systems engineering
challenges. Assessing thruster plume interactions with the spacecraft is key in determining thruster
location and other spacecraft configuration issues, often requiring trades between thrust efficiency
and the life of other subsystems, such as the solar arrays. In this chapter we discuss these topics,
concentrating almost exclusively on ion engines and Hall thrusters since they comprise the largest
fraction of electric propulsion with flight heritage.
Electric thruster plumes consist of energetic ions, un-ionized propellant neutral gas, low energy
ions and electrons, and sputtered thruster material. Spacecraft systems engineers must account for
the interaction between each of the plume components and other spacecraft systems. For example,
in North-South station keeping by electric thrusters on geosynchronous communications satellites,
plume impingement on solar arrays can be a significant issue. As shown in Fig. 11-1, geosynchro-
nous satellites are in a circular orbit coplanar with the Earth’s equator, with an orbital period of
exactly one day. The satellite appears stationary to an observer on the earth; however, the earth’s
equator is tilted by 23.5 with respect to the plane of the Earth’s orbit around the sun. The plane of
the Earth’s orbit is called the ecliptic plane. The sun’s gravity pulls on a geosynchronous satellite to
change the satellite’s plane toward the ecliptic. If the orbital plane were allowed to change, the sat-
ellite would appear from the ground to move North and South in the sky. Optimal communication
would then require the ground-based antennas to constantly scan North and South to track the
satellite, defeating the big advantage of geosynchronous satellites. Electric thrusters are used on
satellites to counter the sun’s pull and prevent the orbital plane from changing. This application
is referred to as “North-South station keeping”, and Fig. 11-1 shows the Hughes/Boeing patented
[1] strategy for this function.
Most modern satellites are three-axis stabilized with solar arrays that rotate to keep the cells
pointed toward the sun. From a thrust perspective, North-South station keeping is accomplished
most efficiently if the thrusters point in the North and South directions. In geosynchronous orbit,
the solar array axis of rotation points North and South, directly in the path of plumes from the
North-South station keeping thrusters. The thruster energetic ion beam would impinge on the solar
arrays and quickly damage them, dramatically shortening satellite life.
The usual solution is to mount thrusters such that the resultant force is in the North-South direc-
tion, but each plume is then at some finite angle with respect to the solar array axis. The larger the

angle, the greater the thrust loss for station keeping, which leads to requirements for larger thrus-
ters and more propellant mass; the smaller the angle, the greater the array damage, which reduces
satellite life. This trade between North-South thrust efficiency and solar array life requires detailed
knowledge of thruster plumes and their interactions.
Electric thrusters used for primary propulsion, such as those on NASA’s Dawn spacecraft [3] and
the Psyche Mission [4] flying to the asteroid belt, can also create issues associated with plume
impact on the spacecraft solar arrays, exposed components, and scientific instruments. Thruster
plumes and their interactions with the spacecraft must be understood and accommodated for
the spacecraft to perform to specification for the required mission life.
11.2
Plume Physics in Ion and Hall Thrusters
The thruster plume is composed of ions and electrons of various energies and some neutral gas. The
energetic beam ions accelerated by the thruster fields are the dominant ion species and the major
source of thrust. The velocity and angular distributions of these ions can be measured in the lab-
oratory and calculated by the thruster computer models discussed in previous chapters. For ion
thrusters, where the accelerating voltages are typically a thousand volts or more, the weak plume
electric fields have little influence on energetic ion trajectories. In this case, the challenge is usually
determining the ion trajectories from the shaped-grid accelerator structure. However, for Hall
thrusters, where the accelerating voltages may be only a few hundred volts, the plume electric fields
can significantly broaden the energetic ion plume.
The second source of ions is due to charge exchange reactions between beam ions and neutral
propellant gas. The neutral gas is due to un-ionized particles leaving both the thruster and the
neutralizer (hollow cathode) and, in the case of laboratory measurements, background neutrals

present in the vacuum chamber. Charge exchange reactions have usually been associated with
inelastic collisions processes yielding low-energy ions at large angles with respect to the main beam
direction. However, as thruster voltages increase to provide higher Isp, the energy of these scattered
ions can become significant. The total plume plasma density, including all three ion components, is
shown schematically in Fig. 11-2 for a 4-kW Hall thruster.
11.2.1
Plume Measurements
Thruster plume characteristics have been measured extensively in the laboratory and on only a few
spacecraft in space. In the laboratory, most measurements have been of the ion velocities and den-
sities, and some thruster erosion products, but not of the unionized neutral gas, which is in most
cases dominated by background gas in the test chambers. The balance of the thruster gas flow and
the speed of test facility’s vacuum pumps determine the background gas pressure. The maximum
facility pressure during high power testing is usually limited to less than 10−4 Torr. Therefore, the
density of un-ionized propellant from Hall and ion thrusters is greater than the background only
within a few centimeters of the thruster.
The dominance of test facility background neutral gases makes it difficult to directly measure in a
laboratory the secondary plasma environment, which consists of the ions generated by charge
exchange and/or elastic scattering with neutrals, that would be seen on a spacecraft. Spacecraft sys-
tem engineers, therefore, use detailed models [5–9] of the plume and secondary ion generation to
predict the in-flight plasma environment. Several of these models have been validated with flight
data from a few electric propulsion spacecraft.

Flight Data
The first in-flight measurements of the plasma environment generated by an ion thruster were
made on NASA’s Deep Space 1 (DS1) spacecraft [10]. The NSTAR Diagnostics Package that flew
on DS1 included contamination monitors, plasma sensors, magnetometers, and a plasma wave
antenna. The plasma sensors and contamination monitors were mounted on the Remote Sensor
Unit (RSU) [10] as shown in Fig. 11-3. The measured plasma density was an order of magnitude
lower than that measured during ground tests, but it was in good agreement with model predic-
tions. Figure 11-4 shows a comparison of the ion fluxes measured during the DS1 mission by
the remote sensing unit and the computed values [11]. The ion fluxes at the sensor location are
primarily the result of charge exchange between beam ions and un-ionized propellant in the beam.
Measurements of the plume and secondary ions from Hall thrusters were carried out on a Russian
communications satellite, Express-A3 [7]. The satellite had instruments to measure ion fluxes both

monitored effects from the central beam over a cone with a half angle of about 40 . The SPT-
100 Hall thruster plume calculated using the Electric Propulsion Interactions Code (EPIC)
[8, 11] is shown in Fig. 11-5. As was the case for ion thrusters, the measured secondary ion fluxes
were an order of magnitude less than fluxes measured in ground based chambers, but, again, in good
agreement with plume models. The accuracy of the models is illustrated in Fig. 11-6, where the
current density measurements on the Express-A spacecraft are compared to the computed values.

11.2.3
Laboratory Plume Measurements
While the flight measurements show the validity of the models to predict thruster generated plasma
environments, tests in ground-based chambers provide much more detailed measurements than
those made in space.
Experiments conducted by The Aerospace Corporation for Lockheed Martin Space Systems Com-
pany on the Busek-Primex Hall Thruster (BPT-4000) provided plume data [12] for comparison with
computer models. Measurements were taken using fully exposed flux probes (“uncollimated”) for
assessing the non-directional ion flux and probes inside graphite collimators (“collimated”).
Figure 11-7 shows experimental data [12] taken from the BPT-4000 Hall thruster at discharge
power of 3 kW and voltage of 300 V using a collimator for energy spectra at different angles with
respect to the thruster axis. The angle-independent, high-energy peak at E/q
280 V associated
with the main beam is clearly evident. Also apparent is a small-amplitude peak at the lowest
energy values of the collimated spectra from the background chamber plasma. This peak was
dominant in the uncollimated spectra. Figure 11-7 reveals the existence of secondary current den-
sity peaks with relatively high energies compared to the primary resonant charge exchange peak.
For example, at an angle of 40 , the energy associated with the second maximum is approximately
150 eV. These observed ion-flux crests show a marked energy dependence on angle. In an ideal
elastic collision between a moving sphere and an identical stationary sphere, the magnitude of the
final velocity for each sphere is proportional to the cosine of the angle between its final velocity
and the initial velocity of the moving sphere, and the sphere’s kinetic energy varies with the
square of the cosine. Because the RPA data in Fig. 11-7 shows a peak with energy dependence
given roughly by Ebcos2θlab, where Eb is the main ion beam energy and θlab is the angle
with respect to the thruster axis, these peaks have been attributed to simple elastic scattering
(momentum transfer) between beam ions and neutral atoms. Numerical simulations using
calculated differential scattering cross sections confirm that elastic scattering is the cause of
the observed mid-energy peak [13, 14].

Plume Models for Ion and Hall Thrusters
11.3.1
Primary Beam Expansion
Before the advent of multidimensional computer models of thruster plumes, empirical models of
the primary beam expansion were used. These models reproduce the general features of the ion
beam angular distribution. Because they are very simple, they are invaluable for initial trades when
planning electric propulsion system accommodation on spacecraft.
Parks and Katz [15] derived an analytical model of the expansion of an ion beam with Gaussian
profile in its self-consistent, quasi-neutral electric field with or without an initial distribution of
radial velocities. This model is very useful for calculating thruster ion-beam plume characteristics
analytically. The steady state ion continuity and momentum equations in the absence of ioniza-
tion are
∇
ρmv = 0
11 3-1
∇
ρmvv = −∇p
11 3-2
where the mass density, ρm, is the ion mass density.
Assuming the beam has cylindrical symmetry, the axial beam velocity remains constant every-
where and the axial derivative of the pressure can be neglected compared with its radial derivative.
The ion continuity and momentum equations can then be rewritten as
1

The second equation was obtained from the momentum equation by using the continuity equation
to eliminate derivatives of the density. The pressure is given by
p = nkTe
11 3-5
Using the assumption of constant axial velocity, the axial distance, z, can be replaced by the product
of the beam velocity, υz, and t, the time since the beam left the thruster
z = υz t
11 3-6
The axial derivative can be replaced with a time derivative as follows:
∂
∂z = 1
υz

Equations 11.3-3 and 11.3-4 can then be rewritten as

These approximations are quite good if the axial velocity is much greater than both the initial radial
velocities and the ion sound speed.
With the assumption that the ion beam profile starts out and remains a Gaussian profile, the set of
equations can be solved analytically. The beam profile is written as

and the non-dimensional function h(t) describes how the
beam expands radially. The parameter R is chosen to best
represent initial beam width and the initial value of the
expansion parameter h(0) is unity. The density spreads
out as the beam moves axially, but the beam profile
remains Gaussian, as shown in Fig. 11-8.
An ion that starts out at a radial position ro will move
radially outward proportionally to h(t):
r ro, t = roh t
11 3-12
This implies that the radial velocity, υr, is proportional to the time derivative h t).
υr r, t = roh t
11 3-13
Equations 11.3-12 and 11.3-13 can be combined to obtain an expression for the local velocity in
which the initial radial position is eliminated:
υr r, t = r h t
h t
11 3-14
The solution obtained below is valid for a beam with no initial radial velocity, or for an initial radial
velocity distribution that is proportional to radius:
υr r, 0 = υ0
r r
11 3-15
The density, defined by Eq. 11.3-10, and the radial velocity defined in Eq. 11.3-15, both satisfy the
ion continuity equation (Eq. 3.5-10) for any function h(t). The first term in Eq. 11.3-8 then becomes

where the integral has to be calculated numerically. Park’s model has been extended by Ashkenazy
and Fruchtman [16] to include thermal gradient and two-dimensional effects.
The Park’s formula is very similar to an empirical formula developed earlier by Randolph and
Pencil for Hall thrusters [17]. Randolph’s formula has two Gaussians, but does not have the curved
trajectories of the Park’s formula. The four parameters, k0 through k3, in Randolph’s formula are

While the analytical expressions above are invaluable for estimating plume interactions, multidi-
mensional computer models are normally used for detailed calculations. There is general agree-
ment on the physics that control the expansion of the main ion beam from ion and Hall
thruster, but there are differences in the numerical algorithms used to calculate the expansion.
Some researchers [5, 6] employ Particle-In-Cell (PIC) algorithms, where the beam is modeled as
a collection of macro-particles with each particle representing a large number of ions. The velocity
and acceleration of each particle is followed in the self-consistently calculated electric field.
Another approach, which is much less computationally intensive, is to model the thruster beam
as a drifting fluid of cold ions and warm electrons. In this method, the expansion of the fluid-like ion
beam is calculated using a Lagrangian algorithm [7, 8]. The ion beam profile for the Nuclear
Electric Xenon Ion System (NEXIS) ion thruster [18] calculated using this algorithm is
shown in Fig. 11-9. The primary beam is assumed to be comprised of a collisionless, singly ionized,
quasi-neutral plasma expanding in a density-gradient electric field. The electron drift velocity
is small compared to the electron thermal speeds, so momentum balance for electrons can be
written as:

where ve, ϕ, and pe are the electron velocity, electric potential, and electron pressure, respectively.
Assuming an ideal gas electron pressure, the potential follows the Boltzmann relation,
ϕ = kTe
e
ln
ne
n ∞
11 3-31
with Te being the electron temperature, ne is the plasma density, and n∞is a reference plasma den-
sity. The plume is also assumed to be isothermal. This is a better approximation for space conditions
than in the laboratory where inelastic collisions with background neutrals will tend to cool the
electrons.
In this model, ions are assumed to be cold compared with the electrons (pi ≈0), and their accel-
eration dominated by the electric field:
M Dvi
Dt = −e∇ϕ
11 3-32
Since the drift velocity of the ions is much greater than their thermal velocity, the high velocity ions
are modeled as a fluid, with a velocity of vi. The governing equations, solved in 2-D (R-Z) geometry,
are conservation of mass and momentum:
∇nvi = 0
Mvi ∇nvi = −en∇ϕ
11 3-33
where n = ne = ni. The accuracy of the algorithm has been confirmed by comparisons of analytical
solutions with model problems in one and two dimensions [11]. The Lagrangian modeling
approach leads to reduced numerical noise compared with PIC algorithms. However, unlike
PIC algorithms, the fluid technique ignores spreading of the beam because of ion temperature
and, in the case of ion thrusters, the angular distribution coming out of each grid aperture.
11.3.2
Neutral Gas Plumes
The neutral gas density in a laboratory vacuum chamber has three components: gas from the
thruster, gas from the neutralizer hollow cathode, and the background chamber density. To model
the neutral gas density, the gas from ion thrusters can be approximated by isotropic emission from a
disk with the diameter of the grid:
no
cos θ
r2
11 3-34
For Hall thrusters, the neutral gas density can be approximated using an annular anode gas flow
model with isotropic emission from the channel. This is done by calculating emissions from two
disks, one large and one smaller, and subtracting the smaller from the larger. The neutral density
drop-off with r and z from a disk emitting a Maxwellian distribution is calculated using an approx-
imate view factor. Energetic CEX neutrals are negligible compared to the total neutral density and
are therefore not included when modeling the neutral gas density.
For plume models, the neutral gas from the neutralizer hollow cathode is usually assumed to be
from isotropic emission at a constant temperature equal to the neutralizer cathode orifice temper-
ature. Although the neutralizer is offset from the thruster axis of symmetry, in cylindrical 2-D codes
there are an equal number of points from the thruster axis closer to and farther from the neutralizer.
The cylindrically averaged neutral density for any point at a distance z downstream is estimated as
if the point was along the thruster centerline. The vacuum chamber background neutral density is
11.3 Plume Models for Ion and Hall Thrusters
447

usually assumed to be constant. Based on values of the ambient temperature and pressure the back-
ground density can be determined assuming an ideal gas law. No background density is assumed for
calculations in space conditions. Figure 11-10 shows each of the three components and the total
calculated neutral density [14] for the BPT-4000 Hall thruster.
11.3.3
Secondary Ion Generation
Low energy ions are created near a thruster exit plane by charge exchange collisions between the
main ion beam and the neutral gas. The mechanism is the same for both gridded ion and Hall thrus-
ters. Charge exchange (CEX) ion density can be computed using a two-dimensional, R, Z-geometry
PIC code, while using the main beam ion densities computed by the Lagrangian calculations and
the neutral gas profile as inputs. The charge exchange ion production rate, nCEX, is calculated
assuming that the beam ions have a velocity, υb, much greater than the neutral gas velocity:
nCEX = nin0υbσCEX
11 3-35
Resonant charge exchange cross sections between singly charged xenon ions and neutral xenon
atoms range from 30 Å2 to 100 Å2 for typical ion and Hall thruster energies [19].
The charge exchange ion density is calculated by tracking particle trajectories in density gradient
electric fields using a finite current barometric law for the electron density (electron current equals
ion current). Poisson’s Equation is solved on a finite element grid and iterated until steady state
CEX densities and density gradient potentials are self-consistent. Comparisons of the CEX plume
model with flight data from the NSTAR’s ion engine exhibited good agreement [11].
Figure 11-11 shows plume maps at 1 m calculated using this method for the BPT-4000 under both
lab and space conditions. The CEX density in the lab is found to be more than one order of mag-
nitude greater than it is in space because of the dominance of the background neutral gas in the
chamber. With the exception of the neutral gas density, all the terms in the expression for charge
exchange ion generation (Eq. 11.3-35 above) are identical for the laboratory and space. Figure 11-10
showed that at distances greater than about a tenth of a meter downstream of the thruster exit
plane, the chamber gas density is much greater than the gas coming directly from the thruster,
resulting in greater charge exchange ion generation. The computed total ion current in the labo-
ratory case (5.3 A) is in approximate agreement with measurements of the integrated ion current
(5–6 A for collector potential of 20 V) [9]. The calculations assumed a charge exchange cross-section
for 300 V ions of 55 Å2 based on the calculations and measurements by Miller [19].

11 Electric Thruster Plumes and Spacecraft Interactions

The distinctive second peak in the energy spectra captured by the collimated retarding potential
analyzer (RPA) data shown in Fig. 11-7 is from elastic scattering of xenon ions by neutral xenon
atoms. Mikellides et al. [14] have calculated differential cross section data for elastic Xe+ – Xe scat-
tering in a center-of-mass frame of reference. The calculations involve averaging over the pertinent
Xe2
+ potentials, without inclusion of charge exchange. The results are then subsequently corrected
for charge exchange.
The derived, center-of-mass differential cross sections were converted to values in a fixed frame of
reference relative to the laboratory and implemented in the plume model. For comparisons with
RPA measurements, the flux of scattered ions Γis,

was computed at a radius of 1 m (the RPA location). In Eq. 11.3-36, Ib and no are the main beam ion
current and neutral density, respectively. The dimension xc is the characteristic length of the beam
column and d is the radial distance between the thruster and the RPA. The differential contribution
due to the column element along the beam is denoted by dξ, and dσ/dΩ is the differential cross
section.
The results from the complete calculation compared with data are shown in Fig. 11-12. Plotted in
the figures are the results of the calculations of the expanding beam ions, and the beam and scat-
tered ions combined. Also plotted is the ion current probe data for two voltage (V) bias levels of 50 V
and 100 V. The probe bias potential prevents lower energy ions from being collected. As expected,
the beam-only values compare best with the ion probe biased to 100 V since, at this value, most of
the scattered and charge exchanged ions are excluded. The calculation combining beam and elastic
scattering compares well with 50 V-biased probe data since this data includes most of the elastically
scattered ions.

11.3.4
Combined Models and Numerical Simulations
The previous sections outlined some of the different approaches being used to model individual species
and plasma properties in the plumes of ion engines and Hall thrusters. Ultimately, of course, since the
main objective of these models is to support the assessment of plume interactions with spacecraft,
numerical simulations that account for all these effects must be performed, self-consistently and at
least in two dimensions. In cases where thruster clusters are used on the spacecraft and the plumes
are in close enough proximity to affect the expansion of each plume, three-dimensional simulations
are needed (e.g. [20]). Due largely to the relative simplicity of the plume physics compared to those in
the interior of many electric thrusters, plume models and simulations matured early and to sufficient
levels of fidelity to support the thruster-spacecraft integration cycle.
Nonetheless, improvements to the plume physics, their mathematical models, and the compu-
tational approaches used to solve them have continued. One challenge in plume modeling, for
example, has been related to the wide range of length scales that must be resolved in a typical plume
calculation. To be more specific, for typical spacecraft interaction assessments the domain of the
simulation must span many times the thruster diameter, which can be several to tens of meters
away from the engine. At the core of this challenge is the sensitivity of the plume solution to
the details of the conditions in the vicinity of the thruster exit. Fortunately, in ion engines the very
near plume is quite amenable to idealized analytical modeling (as also discussed in Section 11.3.1),
and the accuracy of these models can be considerably improved with only a few basic plasma mea-
surements. These models can then be incorporated easily in a plume simulation to define thruster
boundary conditions, without degrading accuracy and computational speed.
The Hall thruster near-plume plasma, however, is much more complicated and less amenable to
such idealized modeling. To meet the challenge in these thrusters, the most accurate and compu-
tationally manageable approach is to use directly the results from a thruster simulation. This
approach formed the basis of a plume code called HallPlume2D that was developed at JPL in
the mid-2010s [21]. We discuss it briefly here to provide an example of a relatively recent plume
code in which such a strategy was successfully implemented. It is a fitting example also because
HallPlume2D has integrated many of the lessons learned in plume modeling over several decades,
some of which have already been discussed in the previous sections.

HallPlume2D employs a radial-axial (r-z) domain and uses the simulation results from a Hall
thruster code called Hall2De [22] to define boundary conditions at the plume inlet, as illustrated
by the schematic in Fig. 11-13. Referring to Fig. 11-13 (top), Hall2De solves numerically, also in r-z
geometry, the governing equations for the plasma inside the Hall thruster discharge channel and in
the near-plume region. Typically, the latter spans a distance that can be several times the channel
length. Of particular relevance to the discussion here is that in Hall2De ions can be modeled as

distinct fluids or tracked individually using discrete macroparticles. This means that the informa-
tion passed to the HallPlume2D simulation must be consistent with the equations it solves to avoid
interpolations that can lead to inaccuracies and numerical difficulties. Therefore, the ion solver in
HallPlume2D follows the same strategy as that in Hall2De, allowing for both multi-fluid and dis-
crete particle methods. In both strategies, ionization and charge exchange collisions are accounted
for. The neutrals gas also is solved in the same manner as that in Hall2De [23]. For the electrons, the
temperature is computed by solving an energy conservation equation that is subject to Dirichlet
boundary conditions at the Hall2De-HallPlume2D interface. This interface is depicted by the
dashed line in Fig. 11-13 (bottom). Because the thruster boundary in the plume simulation is delib-
erately chosen to be far from the thruster exit, the applied magnetic field is neglected and the elec-
tric field and plasma potential are computed using Boltzmann’s law for the electrons.
The intentional similarity of the approaches implemented to solve the mathematical models in
the two codes allows for the unambiguous definition of boundary conditions at the inlet of the
plume simulation with relative ease, and leads to higher-fidelity solutions. Some representative
results are shown in Fig. 11-14. The simulations were of a magnetically shielded Hall thruster devel-
oped for the Advanced Electric Propulsion System that will propel the Power and Propulsion Ele-
ment on Gateway [24]. Gateway is a planned outpost that will orbit the Moon and serves as a critical
piece of infrastructure for NASA’s Artemis program. Before using the results for thruster–spacecraft
integration assessments, the simulations were first validated using measurements taken in a vac-
uum facility during thruster testing, when the background pressure was on the order of 5 μTorr
(6.7 × 10−4 Pa). The comparison shown in Fig. 11-14 is between simulation and measurement of
the total ion current density, 0.8 m away from thruster as a function of plume angle. The simulation
was performed by imposing the same background pressure as that in the ground facility during
thruster testing, at a discharge voltage and power of 600 V and 12 kW, respectively. Also shown
for comparison is the simulation result in vacuum. As with the results discussed in the preceding
section, the two simulations expose the effect of the facility background on the ion current density

propulsion on spacecraft.
11.4
Spacecraft Interactions
To design a spacecraft to accommodate electric thrusters, it is necessary to understand how the
thruster plumes interact with the spacecraft and its payloads. Thruster plumes affect the spacecraft
immediately during their operation, for example, by momentum transfer from plume impingement
or optical emissions, and by slow, cumulative processes, such as ion erosion of spacecraft surfaces or
contamination of surfaces by materials generated by thruster wear. The immediate interactions
may affect spacecraft operations; the longer term interactions may affect spacecraft life.
Unique to electric propulsion is the interaction between the thruster plumes and the spacecraft
electrical system, in particular the solar arrays. Electric thruster plumes are composed of charged
particles and can carry currents between the thruster electrical power system and exposed electrical
conductors such as solar array cell edges and interconnects. Although the currents that flow
through the thruster plumes are in general quite small, they may cause changes in subsystem poten-
tials. These potential changes, if not anticipated, may be mistaken for system anomalies by space-
craft operators.
As described in previous sections, while most of the plume is in the thrust direction, a small frac-
tion of the thruster exhaust is emitted at large angles. The large angle component is mostly com-
posed of low velocity particles. Some high-energy ions in Hall thruster plumes can be found at
angles greater than 45 , but at such a low flux density that they will have little impact on spacecraft
life. Techniques for quantitatively calculating the effects of thruster plumes on spacecraft are pre-
sented in the following sections.
11.4.1
Momentum of the Plume Particles
Just as with chemical thrusters, when electric thruster plumes impact spacecraft surfaces, they exert
a force which causes a torque on the spacecraft. The force is easily calculated as the difference in
momentum between the plume particles that impact the surface and the momentum of particles
that leave the surface. The momentum of the plume particles is the sum of the ion and neutral atom
fluxes. Since the plume consists primarily of ions, and the velocity of the ionized particles is much
greater than the neutral atoms, the neutral component can usually be neglected. The ion momen-
tum is
pi = niMXevi,
11 4-1
and the neutral momentum is
po = noMXevo,
11 4-2
so that the total plume momentum is
pplume = pi + po ≈pi
11 4-3
In one extreme, an ion that impacts a surface may scatter elastically and leave the surface with its
kinetic energy unchanged, but its velocity component normal to the surface is reversed:
pelastic
surface n = −2pplume n,
11 4-4

453

where n is the unit vector normal to the impacted surface. In the other extreme, the incident xenon
ion resides on the surface long enough to transfer its momentum and energy to the surface, and the
particle leaves the surface with a velocity distribution corresponding to the surface temperature.
This process is called accommodation, and the fraction of particles that undergo this process is
called the accommodation coefficient.
Since spacecraft surfaces are typically less than a few hundred degrees Kelvin, the velocities of
accommodated atoms are orders of magnitude less than energetic thruster ions. For example, the
speed of a xenon atom leaving a 300 K surface is
υi 300K =
kT
M = 137 m s ,
11 4-5
while the speed of a beam ion from a 300-V Hall thruster is approximately
υb 300eV =
2eV
M = 22, 000 m s
11 4-6
Because the thermal speeds are so small compared with the beam speeds, the momentum of re-
emitted surface-accommodated ions can be ignored when calculating surface torques. The momen-
tum transfer per unit area is approximated by
F = 2 −Ac pplume,
11 4-7
where Ac is the surface accommodation coefficient, which has a range of values from 0 to 1. Flight
data from the Express-A satellite shows that accommodation coefficients for Hall thruster ions on
the solar arrays were close to unity [7].
11.4.2
Sputtering and Contamination
A major concern for implementing electric thrusters on earth orbiting satellites is that energetic ions
from the thruster beam will erode spacecraft surfaces. As discussed above, North-South station-
keeping with body-mounted thrusters invariably leads to high-energy ions bombarding some part
of the solar arrays. When these high-energy ions impact the solar arrays or other spacecraft surfaces,
they can cause erosion by sputtering atoms. However, with proper placement and orientation of the
thrusters, and the use of stay-out “zones” during which the thrusters are not operated because the
plume would impinge on the array, the ion flux can be small enough to keep electric thrusters from
limiting satellite life. Whether a given surface erodes or accumulates material depends on the relative
rates of sputtering and the deposition of sputter deposits. The deposits result from erosion products
from the thruster itself, as well as material sputtered from other spacecraft surfaces.
Sputtering affects spacecraft in two ways. First, spacecraft surfaces can erode by sputtering, or be
contaminated by the buildup of sputtering products. Primary thruster beam ions are the principal
source of sputtering, and spacecraft surfaces within a narrow cone angle of the thrust direction will
erode significantly because of ion sputtering. The cone angle where sputtering is important depends
on the specific thruster and is usually narrower for ion thrusters than for Hall effect thrusters. For
example, the NEXIS ion thruster primary beam plume, shown in Fig. 11-9, has a half angle for all
particles of only about 20 and 95% of the particles are within a 10 half angle.
Second, while ion and Hall thrusters typically usually use an inert gas propellant, any type of
thruster can potentially contaminate spacecraft surfaces. The sources of contamination are thruster
material sputtered by energetic ions and spacecraft material sputtered by the main thruster beam.
In ion thrusters, sputter erosion of grid material not only limits thruster life, but the sputtered grid
454
11 Electric Thruster Plumes and Spacecraft Interactions

material may be a significant source of contamination to spacecraft surfaces. This was recognized
early in the development of commercial ion thrusters [25], and as a result, a third grid was added to
reduce the amount of sputtered grid material coming from the thruster and to shield the spacecraft
from grid sputter products. The third grid has the added benefit of dramatically reducing the grid
sputter rate by preventing charge exchange ions made downstream of the third grid from hitting the
accelerator grid [26]. For ion thrusters with metal grids, the problem of contamination in the
absence of a third grid can be quite important. Only a few monolayers of a metallic contaminant
can make large changes to the optical, thermal, and electrical properties of spacecraft surfaces.
For Hall thrusters, the situation can be quite different. The plume from Hall thrusters normally
has about twice the angular divergence of an ion thruster, and so sputtered thruster material comes
out at large angles. The plume also changes significantly between conventional Hall thruster
designs with exterior hollow cathodes, and Hall thrusters that utilize internal centrally-mounted
cathodes [27]. Early in life most of the contamination comes from sputter erosion of the ceramic
channel wall in conventional Hall thruster designs. Although this can produce a substantial flux of
sputter products, the products are mainly insulating molecules. Deposition of sputtered insulators,
such as Hall thruster channel ceramic or solar cell cover glass materials, has little effect on the
spacecraft surface optical and thermal properties. More problematic is the sputtered graphite mate-
rial from the pole face covers in magnetically shielded thrusters, and the metallic material from the
late life erosion of Hall thruster magnetic pole pieces. In the same manner as with ion thrusters,
very thin layers of the deposited metal can radically change the properties of spacecraft surfaces.
One effect found with Hall thrusters, but common to both ion and Hall thrusters, is that surfaces
can experience net deposition of sputter products or can be eroded away by energetic beam ions,
depending on their location with respect to the thruster ion beam [17]. As shown in Fig. 11-15, the
plume of sputtered products coming from the thruster is normally much broader than the main ion
beam. For surfaces at small angles with respect to the thrust vector, sputtering from the beam ions is
greater than the deposition of thruster erosion molecules. These surfaces will erode over time. How-
ever, surfaces located at large angles to the thruster vector are contaminated by thruster erosion
products faster than they can be sputter away by energetic beam ions. Over time, sputtered thruster
material will accumulate on these surfaces. For the SPT-100 Hall thruster, the dividing line between
erosion and deposition is about 65 [17].
Besides thruster erosion products, the other source of contamination is spacecraft surface mate-
rial sputtered by thruster beam ions. Computer codes, such as the Electric Propulsion Interactions
Code (EPIC) [8], are used to calculate the erosion and redeposition over the entire spacecraft. EPIC

is an integrated package that models the interactions between a spacecraft and its electric propul-
sion system. The user provides EPIC with spacecraft geometry, surface materials, thruster locations,
and plume parameters, along case study parameters such as orbit and hours of thruster operation.
EPIC outputs thruster plume maps, surface interactions on the 3-D spacecraft, 1-D plots along sur-
faces (e.g. erosion depth on a solar array as a function of distance from the thruster), and integrated
results over duration of mission (e.g. total induced torque in a given direction, total deposition of
eroded material at a specific location on the spacecraft). Figure 11-16 shows results of a sample
EPIC calculation for the Express-A spacecraft during firing of one its four Stationary Plasma Thrus-
ters. The calculation shows both sputter erosion and deposition depths. The thruster erodes the
solar array surface that is along the thruster direction. Some of the eroded material deposits on
other spacecraft surfaces.
11.4.3
Plasma Interactions with Solar Arrays
Ion and Hall thruster plasma plumes connect thrusters electrically to the exposed spacecraft con-
ducting surfaces. It is important to account for current paths through the plasma to prevent current
loops or unintended propulsion system floating potentials.
To understand the plasma currents and floating potentials between the electric propulsion sys-
tem and the rest of the spacecraft, first consider the thruster external cathode as the source of the
plasma. As discussed in Chapter 4, the sheath voltage drop internal to the hollow cathode and resis-
tive heating in the orifice region produce energetic electrons that ionize the propellant gas and gen-
erate plasma. The combined insert and orifice potential drops are typically between 10 and 15 V,
causing the external plasma to be about the same value above cathode common, as illustrated in
Fig. 11-17. The hollow cathode generated plasma has an electron temperature of about 2–3 eV, typ-
ical of many laboratory plasmas.
The spacecraft acts as a Langmuir probe in the thruster plume plasma and will float to a poten-
tial where the ion and electron currents from the plasma to the spacecraft body are equal.

11 Electric Thruster Plumes and Spacecraft Interactions

As discussed in Chapter 3, plasma electron velocities are
much higher than ion velocities, so current balance is
achieved by repelling most of the plasma electrons. This bal-
ance occurs when the surface is a few times the electron tem-
perature negative of the local plasma potential. If the electric
propulsion system were isolated from spacecraft ground by a
very high impedance, cathode common would float around
10 V negative with respect to spacecraft ground, as illustrated
in Fig. 11-18.
When the spacecraft has exposed surfaces at different vol-
tages, predicting the cathode common floating potential is
more difficult. An extreme case would be if the spacecraft solar
arrays had a large area at high positive voltage immersed in the
thruster plume. Then, to achieve current balance, the high
voltage area would be close in potential to the thruster plume
plasma. For example, assume that the spacecraft had 100 V
solar arrays. Since the cathode common is only about 10 V neg-
ative with respect to the thruster plume plasma, cathode common would be 90 V positive compared
to spacecraft ground as illustrated in Fig. 11-19.
On operational spacecraft, cathode common will float somewhere between the two extremes,
−15 to +90 V for a 100 V bus, depending on the array construction, and may vary with orien-
tation and season. Cathode common potential can be held at a fixed potential with respect to
spacecraft chassis ground by tying the electric propulsion system circuit ground to spacecraft
ground with a resistor. Plasma currents collected by exposed spacecraft surfaces will flow
through the resistor. These currents can be limited by reducing the exposed conducting area
in the thruster plumes. The plasma currents are usually quite small. For example, if the charge
exchange plasma plume density one meter from the thruster axis is
1014 m−3, the conducting
area on a square meter of solar array would collect only a few milli-amperes of electron current.
A 1 kilo-ohm resistor could then clamp cathode common within a few volts of spacecraft
ground.

Interactions with Payloads
11.5.1
Microwave Phase Shift
Electromagnetic waves interact with plasmas, particularly if the wave frequency is on the order of
or lower than the plasma frequency along its path of propagation. In most spacecraft applications,
the communications and payload frequencies are so high (>1 GHz) that there is little effect. For a
typical thruster, the main beam plume density drops below 1015 m−3 less than a meter from the
thruster, and then it drops even more rapidly at greater distances. The plasma frequency at this
density about 1 m from the thruster, from Eq. 3.5-25, is 285 MHz.
As a result, microwave signals with frequencies below a few hundred megahertz could be affected
by the thruster plasma-plume. However, even at higher frequencies, highly directional antenna pat-
terns should be analyzed for possible distortion by small phase shifts caused by the plasma. A plane
wave with frequency f passing through a plasma with density ne will undergo a phase shift ∇φ
according to the following formula
∇φ ≈πf

where c is the speed of light and nc is the critical density at which the plasma density has a plasma
frequency equal to the microwave frequency. Since the plasma density drops rapidly with distance
from the thruster, the scale length over which the plasma frequency is comparable to the wave fre-
quency is usually small.

Plume Plasma Optical Emission
The optical emissions from ion and Hall thrusters are very weak, but can be measured by sensitive
instruments. The only in-space measurement of the optical emissions from a xenon plasma plume
generated by an electric propulsion device is from a shuttle flight that had a “plasma contactor” as

part of the Space Experiments with Particle Accelerators (SEPAC) [28] flown on the NASA Space
Shuttle Mission STS-45. The “plasma contactor” was actually a XIPS 25-cm thruster without the
accelerator grids or neutralizer hollow cathode. Plasma and electron current from the discharge
chamber were allowed to escape into space, unimpeded by an ion accelerator grid set.
The absolute intensity optical emission spectrum measured in space of the xenon plasma plume
of the operating plasma source is shown in Fig. 11-20. The spectrum was measured by the Atmos-
pheric Emissions Photometric Imaging (AEPI) spectrographic cameras. The source was the SEPAC
plasma contactor [28, 29] that generated about 2A of singly charged xenon ions from a ring-cusp
discharge chamber. The plasma density was about 1017 m−3 and its temperature was about 5 eV. On
leaving the discharge chamber, the quasi-neutral plasma expanded into the much less dense sur-
rounding ionosphere. The spectrum was taken about 15 m from the contactor plume, focusing on
the plume about 1.5 m downstream of the contactor exit plane. The apparent broadness of the lines
is because of the spectrograph’s relatively wide slit [30].
Optical emissions from the SEPAC plasma contactor are higher than the emissions expected from
a similarly sized ion thruster for two reasons. First, the plasma contactor ion density is higher
because the contactor ions are traveling about a quarter as fast as thruster beam ions. Second,
the electrons in the SEPAC plasma contactor plume originate in the discharge chamber and are
much hotter than the neutralizer cathode electrons in an ion thruster plume, 5 eV versus 2 eV.
As a result, the absolute magnitude of the spectrum in Fig. 11-20 is about two orders of magnitude
more intense than one would expect from an operating ion thruster.
The source of the strong visible lines in the xenon spectrum is interesting. Visible emissions from
states with allowed transitions to ground contribute very little to the total observed visible spectra.
Most of the visible emissions originate from states that do not have allowed transitions to ground.
The reason for this is that an optically allowed transition to ground is typically a thousand times
more probable than a transition to another excited state. Thus, if allowed, almost every excitation
will lead to an ultraviolet (UV) photon. Indeed, most of the radiation from xenon plasmas is in the
UV, with only a small part in the visible. Line emissions in the visible are dominated by radiative
decay from states where the radiative transitions to ground are forbidden. When an electron col-
lision excites one of these states, it decays though a multi-step process to ground, since the direct

radiative decay to ground is forbidden and the collisional decay rate is orders of magnitude slower
than the allowed radiative transitions. Although the excitation cross sections from ground to these
states are smaller than those to states with optically allowed transitions, the absence of a competing
single step decay path to ground allows these states to dominate the visible emissions.
The total power radiated by a thruster plume, both in the visible and UV, can be estimated
by assuming that both the ion beam and the neutral gas expand with the same effective cone
angle θ. The radius of the beam and neutral plumes as a function of the distance z from the thruster
is then
R = Ro + z tan θ,

You have just been hired as a propulsion engineer by a spacecraft manufacturer who plans to
launchacommercialsatellitethatusesa30-cmxenonionengine operatingforstation-keeping.
The manufacturer plans to perform a costly test to assess whether a 1-mil-thick Kapton coating
over a critical spacecraft surface located near the engine will survive 1500 h of thruster oper-
ation. You immediately recall that your coursework may allow you to determine the sputtering
erosion of the Kapton layer by analysis, and thus possibly save your employer the high cost of
performing the test. The spacecraft surface in question is a flat panel located perpendicular to
the thruster’s r-z plane as shown in Fig. 11-21. The panel length exceeds 6 m.
a) Assuming that the ion beam consists of singly charged ions only:
b) Use the equations in your textbook to express the ion beam density, n, as a function of
spatial coordinates (r, z). Produce contour plots of the beam density within a radius of
r = 0.5 m from the center of the thruster exit (r = 0, z = 0). Assume that the ion density
n0 at (r = 0, z = 0) is 4 × 1015 m−3 and that the ion beam velocity V0 is 40 km/s. Also,
assume that uBohm/V0 = 0.03.
c) Derive an expression for the radial component of the ion beam flux, Γr = nur, as a func-
tion of spatial coordinates (r, z). Plot the radial ion beam flux as a function of z for r = 0.3,
0.4 and 0.5 m.

The most general elastic collision process between two particles of unequal masses m1 and

Chapter 12
Flight Electric Thrusters
12.1
Introduction
Electric thruster technology development programs continue to improve the performance of these
engines. It is worthwhile to survey the state-of-the-art thrusters that have flown to date. Table 12-1
shows a list of the significant electric thruster first flights [1, 2]. Thousands of ion and Hall thrusters
are presently in use in space in communications satellites and deep space exploration missions. In
this chapter, thrusters that have flown in the last 25 years in satellite station-keeping and spacecraft
prime-propulsion applications are described. These thrusters are ion thruster and Hall thruster
systems that use xenon and krypton as the propellant. SpaceX has launched thousands of
Earth-orbiting spacecraft with a krypton Hall thruster on board each, but the performance para-
meters are not public so these are not included in Table 12-1. The parameters given for the thrusters
include the neutralizer cathode flow rates, since the total mass utilization efficiency is important at
the system level for flight operation on satellites and spacecraft.
12.2
Ion Thrusters
The first modern inert-gas ion thrusters to fly were intended for station-keeping applications on
geosynchronous satellites and were developed by Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (MELCO) for
use on the Japanese “Engineering Test Satellite (ETS-6)” in 1994 [3, 4]. These 13-cm Kaufman
thrusters produced nominally 20 mN of thrust at an Isp of about 2400 s. Despite launch vehicle
problems that caused the satellite to fail to reach its planned orbit, the thrusters were success-
fully operated in orbit. The same electric propulsion subsystem was launched on the COMETS
satellite in 1996, which also failed to reach its planned orbit. Development of ion thrusters for
communications satellite station-keeping applications is continuing at JAXA in Japan. The first
successful use of ion thrusters in a commercial station-keeping application was the Hughes
13-cm Xenon Ion Propulsion System (XIPS©) [5, 6], which was launched into orbit in 1997 on
the Hughes PAS-5 satellite. The XIPS system utilizes two fully redundant subsystems, each con-
sisting of two thrusters, a power supply, and a xenon gas controller. The performance parameters
for the 13 cm XIPS thruster are shown in Table 12-2. The thrusters produce nominally 18 mN of
thrust at an Isp of 2800 s and a total efficiency of about 51%. A schematic of the 13 cm XIPS thruster
is shown in Fig. 12-1, and a photograph of the thruster is shown in Fig. 12-2. Over 56 of these thrus-
ters were launched into orbit and successfully used for North–South station keeping on Hughes
and Boeing communications satellites.

12 Flight Electric Thrusters

The next ion thruster to fly was NASA’s
NSTAR ion engine [7, 8], which is a ring-cusp,
DC electron-bombardment discharge thruster
with an active grid diameter of 28.6 cm. NSTAR
was developed and manufactured by a team of
NASA GRC, JPL and Hughes/Boeing EDD, and
launched in 1998 on the Deep Space 1 spacecraft.
This ion engine has arguably been the most ana-
lyzed and tested ion thruster in history, with over
16,000 h of operation in space, over 40,000 h of life
testing, and hundreds of papers published on its
design and performance. NSTAR was operated
over a wide throttle range in the DS1 application
from a minimum input power to the PPU of 580 W
to a maximum power of over 2550 W. The
Extended Life Test of this thruster at JPL demon-
strated 30,252 h of operation distributed across
several of the throttle levels, and was terminated
with the engine still running to provide life status and data for the subsequent DAWN mission [9].
The throttle table used on DS1, with parameters for the NSTAR thruster from a review by Brophy [8],
is shown in Table 12-3. A photograph of the NSTAR engine, which was manufactured by Hughes
Electron Devices Division (now Stellant Systems, Torrance, CA), is shown in Fig. 12-3.
The next ion thruster technology launched was designed for both orbit-raising and station-
keeping applications on a commercial communications satellite. The 25-cm XIPS© thruster was

first launched in 1999 on a Hughes/Boeing 702 sat-
ellite. Although the 25-cm XIPS ion thruster was
developed [10] at Hughes Research Laboratories
in the same time frame as the NSTAR engine
and has a similar basic design as the 13-cm XIPS
thruster, the 25-cm thruster entered production
after
the
13-cm
version,
and
incorporated
sufficient
improvements
to
be
considered
a
second-generation device. A photograph of the
25-cm XIPS thruster, which was manufactured by
Hughes Electron Devices Division (now Stellant
Systems, Torrance, CA), is shown in Fig. 12-4.
There are presently well over a hundred XIPS-25
cm thrusters in orbit that have been successfully
used with over 99% reliability for orbit raising
and station keeping, and momentum control.
The initial operation of the 25-cm thrusters in
space on the 702 satellites was described in 2002
[11]. After launch, these thrusters are first used
for orbit raising and then provide all the propulsion
requirements for orbit control, including North–South and East–West station keeping, attitude con-
trol, and momentum dumping. The ion thrusters are also used for any optional station change stra-
tegies and will ultimately be used for de-orbit at the end of the satellite’s lifetime. The “high power”

orbit insertion mode requires nearly continuous
operation by two of the thrusters for times of
500–1000 h, depending on the launch vehicle
and satellite weight. This mode utilizes about
4.5 kW of bus power to each thruster generate
a 1.2 kV, 3 A ion beam, which produces
165 mN thrust at a Isp of about 3500 s. Once
orbit insertion is completed, each of the four
thrusters is fired once daily for an average of
about 45 min in a “low power”, 2 kW mode
for station keeping. In this mode, the beam volt-
age is kept the same, and the discharge current
and gas flow are reduced to generate a 1.2 kV,
1.5 A beam that produces nominally 79 mN of
thrust at an Isp of 3400 s. The thruster perfor-
mance parameters are shown in Table 12-4.
Recently, tests by the manufacturer and JPL
have demonstrated that the XIPS engine and
PPU can be throttled from a PPU input power
level of 400 W to over 5 kW. Over this range, the performance of the 25-cm thruster significantly
exceeds the NSTAR thruster performance [12].
The next flight of ion thrusters was on the European Space Agency Artemis spacecraft launched
in 2001. Artemis carried four ion thruster assemblies, two EITA (Electron-bombardment Ion
Thruster Assembly) systems manufactured by Astrium UK, and two RITA (Radio-frequency
Ion Thruster Assembly) systems developed by Astrium Germany. The EITA system, also called
the UK-10 system, used copies of the T5 thruster [13, 14], and the RITA system used RIT–10
ion thrusters [15, 16]. Artemis was intended to be launched into a geosynchronous orbit, but a
malfunction of the launcher’s upper stage placed the satellite into a lower orbit. The ion thrusters
were used in an unplanned orbit-raising role to rescue the spacecraft from the lower 31,000 km
parking orbit and raise the spacecraft to the proper geosynchronous orbit. The thrusters then
successfully performed standard EP station-keeping activities.

The EITA/UK-10/T5 thruster is a 10-cm Kaufman thruster [13] that was manufactured by
QinetiQ in England. The performance of the T5 Kaufman thruster in station-keeping applications
[13] is given in Table 12-5. A schematic of a generic Kaufman thruster was shown in Chapter 4, and
a photograph of the T5 thruster is shown in Fig. 12-5. The T5 thruster generates an 1100 V, 0.329 A
xenon ion beam that produces about 18 mN of thrust at a nominal Isp of 3200 s with a total effi-
ciency of about 55%.
The RITA system used a RIT-10 rf ion thruster
originally developed [15] at the University of
Giessen in Germany and manufactured [16] for
Artemis by Astrium in Germany. The perfor-
mance of the RIT-10 thruster in station-keeping
applications [16] is shown in Table 12-6. A sche-
matic of a generic rf thruster was shown in
Chapter 4, and a photograph of the RIT-10 rf
ion thruster from [16] is shown in Fig. 12-6.
The RIT-10 thruster generates a 1500 V, 0.234 A
xenon ion beam that produces 15 mN of thrust
at an Isp of 3400 s and a total efficiency in excess
of 51%.
The Institute of Space and Astronautical Sci-
ence (ISAS) of the Japan Aerospace Exploration
Agency (JAXA) launched four μ10 electron
cyclotron resonance (ECR) ion thrusters on the
Hayabusa (formerly Muses-C) spacecraft [18] in
2003.
These
10-cm
grid-diameter
thrusters
[19, 20] successfully provided primary propul-
sion for this asteroid sample return mission. An
upgraded version of the μ10 with higher thrust
and performance [21] was then used the Haya-
busa-2 mission that launched in 2014. The

thruster uses 4.2 GHz microwaves to produce
the main plasma in the thruster and drive the
electron neutralizer. A schematic drawing of
the thruster was shown in Chapter 4. The per-
formance of the upgraded μ10 thruster is shown
in Table 12-7, and a photograph of the μ10
thruster from [22] is shown in Fig. 12-7. The
10-cm ECR ion thruster generates a 1500 V,
0.178 A xenon ion beam that produces 12 mN
of thrust at an Isp of 3122 s and a peak total effi-
ciency of 39.6%.
The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency
(JAXA) launched four 20 mN-class Kaufman
ion thrusters developed by Mitsubishi Electric
Corporation on the Engineering Test Satellite
VIII (ETS-VIII) [23] in 2006. The 12-cm grid-
diameter Kaufman thrusters provide North–South station keeping for this large geosynchronous
communications satellite. The performance of the 12-cm Kaufman thruster [24] is shown in
Table 12-8, and a photograph of the thruster from [25] is shown in Fig. 12-8. At its nominal

operating condition, the thruster generates a
996-V, 0.432–0.480-A xenon ion beam that pro-
duces 20.9–23.2 mN of thrust at an Isp of 2402 to
2665 s and a total efficiency of about 46–50%.
The next flight of ion thrusters were T6 Kauf-
man ion thrusters [26–28] developed by QinetiQ
and launched on the BepiColombo mission in
2018 [29]. The 20-cm grid-diameter Kaufman
thrusters operating singly and in pairs to provide
prime propulsion for this mission. The perfor-
mance of the T6 Kaufman ion thruster [27, 28]
is shown in Table 12-9, and a photograph of the
thruster is shown in Fig. 12-9.
A flight demonstration of the NASA Evolution-
ary Xenon Thruster (NEXT) [30], developed by
NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC), was per-
formed by the DART Mission [31] that launched
in 2021. The NEXT-C thruster, manufactured by
Aerojet, successfully operated in space at about
3 kW of power [32], limited by the power available
from the solar arrays. The NEXT thruster is capable of throttling from 0.5 kW to 6.9 kW, producing
25–236 mN of thrust at an Isp ranging from 1400 to 4190 s. The performance capabilities of the
NEXT thruster are listed in Table 12-10, and a photograph of the NEXT ion thruster is shown
in Fig. 12-10.
There are a significant number of ion thrusters in development world-wide for prime propulsion
and satellite station-keeping applications. Since these thrusters have not flown as of this date, they
will not be covered in detail and only mentioned here. NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) led the
development of the 25-kW Nuclear Electric Xenon Ion thruster System (NEXIS) [33], which produced
the highest efficiency (>81%) xenon ion thruster developed to date. NASA’s GRC also led the devel-
opment of the 30 kW High Power Electric Propulsion (HiPEP) thruster [34], which featured a rectan-
gular geometry with both rf and DC hollow cathode plasma-production versions. In Japan, the
Institute of Space and Astronautical Science is developing a 20-cm diameter, 30-mN class microwave

[35].
In
Germany,
Astrium is developing higher power rf ion thrus-
ters for station-keeping and orbit-raising applica-
tions [36]. Finally, ring-cusp and rf ion thrusters
are being miniaturized for applications that
require thrust levels of the order of 1 mN or less.
The 3-cm Miniature Xenon Ion thruster (MiXI)
[37] uses a DC discharge, ring-cusp geometry
with closely spaced ion optics to produce up to
3 mN of thrust at beam voltages of up to 1200 V.
The micro-Newton rf Ion Thruster (μN-RIT)
[38] use a low frequency (≈1 MHz) rf discharge
scaled down to 2–4 cm in diameter to produce
precisionthrustlevelsaslowas20 μNatbeamvol-
tages in excess of 1 kV. There are many additional
small research and development programs at
universities and in small businesses, but these
are too numerous to be covered here.
12.3
Hall Thrusters
The most successful and extensive electric propulsion development and application has been by the
Russians flying Hall thrusters for station keeping on satellites [39, 40]. Over 140 Hall thrusters
have been operated in space since 1971 when the Soviets first flew a pair of Hall thrusters called
Stationary Plasma Thrusters (SPT) on the Meteor satellite [40]. This name is translated from the
Russian literature, but refers to the continuous operation (“stationary”) of the Hall thruster in
comparison to the pulsed-plasma thrusters (PPT) that the Russians had previously tested and flown
in the 1960s [40]. SPT thrusters for satellite applications have been developed with different sizes
characterized by the outside diameter of the plasma discharge slot of 50 to over 140 mm [40].

12 Flight Electric Thrusters

The performance of four sizes of the SPT thruster manufactured by Fakel in Russia is shown in
Table 12-11. These are all “conventional” Hall thruster designs and do not incorporate magnetic
shielding to date. The SPT-100 is the most widely used of this family, operating nominally at a dis-
charge voltage of 300 V and current of 4.5 A to produce 82 mN of thrust at an Isp of 1600 s and a total
efficiency of 50% averaged over the life of the thruster. The different SPT thrusters shown in the
table have been tested at discharge voltages of 200 to 500 V and have all operated in space at power
levels of a few hundred watts up to 4.5 kW. These Hall thrusters have also been tested on a variety of
gases such as argon and krypton, but xenon is the present standard for space applications.
A schematic of Hall thrusters was shown in Chapter 7.
The first flight of a Hall thruster on a US spacecraft was the 1998 launch of a D-55 TAL (Thruster
with Anode Layer) Hall thruster [41, 42] manufactured by TsNIIMASH in Russia on the National
Reconnaissance Office’s Space Technology Experiment Satellite (STEX). The STEX mission
was intended to develop and demonstrate advanced spacecraft technologies in space, including
Hall thrusters. The D-55 TAL thruster nominally operates in xenon at 1.35 kW with an Isp of about
1500 s, but due to power limitations on the spacecraft was required to run at a discharge of 300 V
and 2.2 A (660 W).
The European Space Agency (ESA) demonstrated the use of commercial Hall thruster technology
on the SMART-1 (Small Mission for Advanced Research in Technology) spacecraft in a lunar orbit-
ing mission [43]. A PPS-1350-G Hall thruster [44], manufactured by what is now SAFRAN in
France, was launched on SMART-1 in 2003 and provided primary propulsion for this mission. This
thruster is based on the SPT-100 design and is similar in size and power level. The thruster was
operated over a throttleable power range of 462–1190 W for this lunar mission, producing a max-
imum thrust of 70 mN at an Isp of 1600 s. The PPS-1350 Hall thruster accumulated about 5000 h of
operation in space, and processed 82 kg of xenon in a very successful mission that featured several
extensions of the mission life due to the thruster capabilities. The nominal performance of this
thruster [45] at 1.35 kW is shown in Table 12-12. The thruster schematic was shown in
Chapter 7, and a photograph of the PPS-1350 Hall thruster is shown in Fig. 12-11.
The first commercial use of Hall thrusters by a U.S. spacecraft manufacturer was in 2004 by what
is now Maxar Space on the MBSAT satellite [46], which used Fakel SPT-100 s provided by Inter-
national Space Technologies Inc.d (ISTI). Maxar has launched dozens of communications satellites
to date that each use two pairs of SPT–100 Hall thrusters to provide North–South station keeping in
Earth orbit. A photograph of a Fakel SPT-100 thruster from [46] is shown in Fig. 12-12.
In 2018, Maxar started flying the SPT-140 Hall thruster on their high-power communications
satellites [47, 48]. Like their lower power SPT-100 propulsion system, the SPT-140 thruster is
manufactured by Fakel in Russia. This thruster has a “conventional” design and was optimized
to operate on the Maxar 1300 series communications satellites at high power for orbit raising at

4.5 kW, and lower power at 3-kW for station
keeping. The thruster performance is listed in
Table 12-11 and produces a maximum thrust
of about 270 mN at an Isp of 1750 s. The STP-
140 will used by the NASA Psyche Mission
[49] that is scheduled to be launched in 2023.
For this deep space prime propulsion and
momentum control application, the EP system
from Maxar (thruster, power processing unit
and xenon flow controller) was modified and
extensively tested over a throttle range of
0.9–4.5 kW [50]. A photograph of the SPT-140
Hall thruster is shown in Fig. 12-13.
The first flight of the PPS®5000 Hall thruster
[51, 52] manufactured by Safran in France was
made 2021 on a French military communica-
tions satellite supplied by Thales Alenia Space.
The thruster performed orbit raising for six
months and then
initiated station-keeping
activities. Nearly a hundred of these thrusters
have been ordered to date for use in European
and
U.S.
communications
satellites.
The
PPS®5000 Hall thruster was originally based
on the design of the Russian SPT-140, but was
developed at Safran to have improved perfor-
mance and life. The extended qualification life
test [53] of this thruster achieved 19,370 h,
17.2 MNs of total impulse, 9539 ON/OFF cycles,
and 972 kg of xenon processed when the test
was voluntarily terminated with the thruster
still operational. A photograph of the PPS®5000
Hall thruster is shown in Fig. 12-14, and the
thruster performance is given in Table 12-13.

12 Flight Electric Thrusters

The first US company to provide flight Hall
thrusters for a spacecraft was Busek, Inc. with
the 200-W BHT-200 that flew on board the U.S.
Air Force TacSat-2 spacecraft that was launched
in 2006 [54, 55]. The Air Force continues to fly
the BHT-200 on various FalconSAT spacecraft.
Busek is continuing qualification of their BHT-
6000 Hall thrusters for the Power and Propulsion
Element (PPE) as part of NASA’s Artemis pro-
gram [56]. The PPE is a high-power, 60-kW solar
electric propulsion spacecraft built by Maxar
Technologies
and
operated
by
NASA
and
planned to launch in 2024.
Lockheed Martin Space Systems began flying
the XR-5 Hall thruster (previously named the
BPT-4000 Hall thruster) developed in the US
by Aerojet [57] on Air Force Advanced-EHF
defense
communications
satellites
in
2010.
Aerojet and JPL have jointly investigated the
applicability of the XR-5 thruster to NASA deep
space missions [58] where throttle range and
efficiency are important. The ability of the XR-
5 to throttle from power levels of 1 to 4.5 kW
was demonstrated with very high efficiency [59].
The XR-5 Hall thruster is presently also being
used for orbit raising and station keeping by
several commercial communications satellites
in the US. The performance of the XR-5 at two
power levels and two discharge voltages is listed
in Table 12-14, and a photograph of the XR-5 is
shown in Fig. 12-15.
The recent emergence of LEO communications
constellations has resulted in unprecedented
numbers of electric thrusters to be launched into
orbit. Since 2018, SpaceX has launched over
3000 Starlink spacecraft [60], with plans for over
10,000 in the constellation, each with a Hall
thruster on board utilizing krypton propellant
for
orbit
insertion
and
station
keeping.
A number of other constellations are in work,
many of which use electric propulsion. These
constellations will drive significant advances in
the
commercial
use
of
electric
propulsion
technology.

Electromagnetic
Thrusters
The first electromagnetic thruster to fly in space
was a Pulsed Plasma Thruster (PPT) on the
“Zond-2” Russian satellite in 1964 [61], which
was used for attitude control. In the U.S., four
PPTs were launched into orbit in 1968 on
the Lincoln Experimental Satellite 6 (LES 6)
experimental military UHF communications
satellite [62]. This PPT system operated for over
a year without issue and demonstrated no inter-
ference with the telemetry or the communica-
tions system of the satellite. Follow-on flights
on the LES 8/9 missions were originally
planned to be equipped with pulsed plasma
thrusters that were fully flight qualified [63],
but the spacecraft were launched with gas

thrusters. Figure 1-6 shows a photograph of the PPT that was used for attitude control on the Earth
Observing (EO-1) Mission in 2000 [64]. PPTs are now a commercial product in the US and are find-
ing applications in CubeSat and other microsatellites.
Experimental prototype MPD thrusters were first flown on Soviet spacecraft [65], and there
have been two additional flights of MPD thrusters by Japan to date. These flight units have all
been pulsed technology demonstration thrusters due to the high power needed to operate con-
tinuously. An MPD thruster was launched onboard the MS-T4 test satellite by the Institute of
Space and Aeronautical Science (ISAS) and the University of Tokyo, in 1980 [66]. This thruster oper-
ated on ammonia at up to 700 A of discharge current for 1.5 ms pulses, and demonstrated up to 22%
efficiency at and Isp of about 2500 s. A second tech-demo MPD was launched as part of Electric Pro-
pulsion Experiment (EPEX) in 1995 by ISAS [67] and used liquid hydrazine as the propellant. This
thruster demonstrated operation at 6-kA (peak) currents and 300 μs FWHM pulse widths with an Isp
over 1000 s. MPD thruster development is continuing at universities and national laboratories
worldwide.

Gas Flow Units Conversions and Cathode Pressure Estimates
Conversion between the different systems of flow units is necessary to calculate various parameters
used in evaluating thruster performance. Owing to the precision required in calculating the thruster
performance, it is necessary to carry several significant digits in the constants used to calculate the
conversion coefficients, which are obtained from the National Institute of Standards and Technol-
ogy (NIST) database that can be found in the NIST website.
Converting flow in Standard Cubic Centimeters per Minute (SCCM) to other flow units for an
ideal gas is achieved as follows. A mole of gas at standard pressure and temperature is Avogadro’s
number (6.02214179 × 1023) of particles at one atmosphere pressure and 0 C (273.15 K), which
occupies 22.413996 liters. The conversions are:

where Ma is the propellant mass in atomic mass units, AMU.
For xenon, Ma = 131.293 AMU, and a correction must be made for its compressibility at STP
which changes the mass flow rate by 0.9931468. Therefore, using Eq. B-4, for xenon:

B-6
It is possible to estimate the neutral gas pressure inside of a hollow cathode insert region and in the
orifice as a function of the propellant flow rate and cathode temperature using analytic gas flow
equations. While these equations may not be strictly valid in some locations, especially the rela-
tively short orifices found in discharge cathodes, they can still provide an estimate that is usually
within 10 to 20% of the actual measured pressures.
In the viscous flow regime, where the transport is because of gas atoms or molecules primarily
making collisions with each other rather than walls, the pressure through a cylindrical tube is gov-
erned by the Poiseuille law [1, 2] modified for compressible gas [3]. The rate at which compressible
gas flows through a tube of length l and radius a (in moles per second) is given [2] from this law by:
Nm = π

l
Pa P1 −P2
RoT

B-7
where a is the tube radius, l is the tube length, Pa is the average pressure in the tube given by
(P1 + P2)/2, ζ is the viscosity, P2 is the downstream pressure at the end of the tube, P1 is the upstream
pressure of the tube, Ro is the universal gas constant, and T is the temperature of the gas. The meas-
ured gas flow rate, or the gas throughput, is given by the ideal gas law:
Q = PmVm = NmRoTm,
B-8
where Pm is the pressure and Vm is the volume where the flow is measured for gas at a temperature
Tm, and Nm is the mole flow rate. The mole flow rate is then Nm = PmVm/RoTm. Defining Tr = T/Tm
and substituting the mole flow rate into Eq. B-1 gives the measured flow to be:
Q =

Putting this in useful units and writing it in terms of a conductance of the tube, which is defined as
the gas flow divided by the pressure drop, gives
Q = 1 28 d4
ζTrl
P2

2 ,
B-10
where Q is the flow in sccm, ζ is the viscosity in poises, d is the orifice diameter, and l the orifice
length in cm, and the pressures are in Torr. The pressure upstream of the cathode orifice is then
P1 =
P2
2 + 0 78 Q ζTr l
d4
1 2
B-11
While Eq. B-11 requires knowledge of the downstream pressure, for this rough estimate it is accept-
able to assume P2 << P1 and neglect this term. For xenon, the viscosity in poises [4] is
ζ = 2 3x10 −4T 0 71 + 0 29 Tr
r
for Tr > 1,
B-12
where Tr = T( K)/289.7. The viscosity in Eq. B-12 is different than Eq. 4.5-9 because
1 Ns/m2 = 10 poise. It should be noted that the temperature of the gas in the hollow cathode
can exceed the temperature of the cathode by factors of 2 to 4 because of charge-exchange heating
with the ions, which then affects the viscosity.

Appendix B Gas Flow Units Conversions and Cathode Pressure Estimates

As an example, take the NSTAR discharge cathode operating at a nominal flow of 3.7 sccm, with
an orifice diameter of 1 mm and the length of the cylindrical section of the orifice as 0.75 mm.
Assuming the gas in the orifice is 4000 K because of charge-exchange heating and P2 = 0, the
upstream pressure is found from Eq. B-11 to be 6.7 Torr. The pressure measured upstream of
the cathode tube for this TH15 case is about 8 Torr [5]. Correcting for the pressure drop in the insert
region (also because of Poiseuille flow), the actual pressure upstream of the orifice plate is about
7.2 Torr. The pressure calculated from Eq. B-11 is low because the downstream pressure is finite
(about 2 Torr where the barrel section ends) and the bevel region at the output of the orifice
has a finite molecular conductance in collisionless flow regime. In general, it can be assumed that
the results of Eq. B-11 are about 10% low due to these effects. Similar agreement has been found for
neutralizer cathodes with straight bore orifices, suggesting that this technique provides reasonable
estimates of the pressure in the cathodes.
Finally, once the pressure inside the cathode or in the orifice region entrance is estimated, it is
straightforward to calculate the local neutral density from Eq. 2.7-2:
no = 9 65 × 1024∗P

where P is the pressure in Torr and T is the gas temperature in K.

Energy Loss by Electrons
The energy lost from the plasma because of electrons being lost to an anode that is more negative
than the plasma potential is derived. Figure C-1 shows the plasma potential distribution in the neg-
ative-going sheath toward the anode wall. The Maxwellian electrons are decelerated and repelled
by the sheath potential. To determine the average energy removed from the plasma by each
electron, moments of the Maxwellian distribution are taken. The electron current density reaching
the wall is given by

The electrons must overcome the sheath potential to reach the wall so the minimum electron speed
toward the wall (assumed to be in the z-direction) is
2eϕ m. The plasma electrons lose kinetic
energy as they traverse the sheath, so the power flux from plasma is

where TeV is in electron volts (eV). This is the energy removed from the plasma per electron striking

It should be noted that this energy loss from the plasma per electron is different than the average
energy that each electron has when it hits the wall. The flux of electrons hitting the anode wall is the
same as analyzed above. The plasma electrons lose kinetic energy as they traverse the sheath, hence

Electron Relaxation and Thermalization Times
Spitzer [1] derived an expression for the slowing down time of test particles (primary electrons in
our case) with a velocity υ =
2Vp m, where eVp is the test particle energy in electron volts, in a
population of Maxwellian electrons at a temperature Te. Spitzer defined the inverse mean velocity
of the Maxwellian electron “field particles” in one dimension as lf =
m 2kTe. The slowing down
time is then given by
τs =
υ
1 + m mf ADl2
f G lf υ
,
F-1
where m is the mass of the test particles, mf is the mass of the field particles, AD is a diffusion
constant given by
AD =
8πe4nf Z2Z2
f lnΛ
m2
,
F-2
where Z is the charge, and lnΛ is the collisionality parameter [2] equal to 23-ln(nf
1/2/Te
3/2).
The function G(lf υ) is defined as
G x = Φ x −xΦ x
2x2
,
F-3
and Φ(x) is the erf function:
Φ x =
2
π1 2
x
0
e −y2dy
F-4
Spitzer gave the values of G(x) in a table, which is plotted in Fig. F-1 and fitted. For x = l2υ greater
than 1.8, a power function fits best with the relation G(x) = 0.4638x−1.957.
In our case, the field particles and the test particles have the same mass, which is the electron
mass, and charge Z = e. The slowing down time is plotted in Fig. F-2 as a function of the primary
particle energy for three representative plasma densities found in the discharge chamber and near
the grids of ion thrusters.
For 15 eV primaries in the discharge chamber plasma with an average temperature of 4 eV and a
density approaching 1018 m−3, the slowing down time is about 10−6 s. The slowing down time is also
plotted in Fig. F-3 as a function of the plasma density for several values of the primary electron

energy, again assuming the plasma has an electron temperature of about 4 eV. As the plasma
density increases, the slowing down time becomes very small (<10−6 s). This will lead to rapid
thermalization of the primary electrons.
For the case of primary electron with some spread in energy, we can examine the time for the
equilibration between that population and the plasma electrons. Assuming that the primaries have
a temperature T1 and the plasma electrons have a temperature T2, the time for the two populations
to equilibrate is
τeq = 3m1 2 kT1 + kT2
3 2
8 2π 1 2ne4lnΛ
F-5
As an example, the slowing time for monoenergetic primaries and primaries with a Maxwellian
distribution of energies injected into a 4 eV plasma is shown in Fig. F-4. The slowing time is
significantly faster than the equilibration time.
