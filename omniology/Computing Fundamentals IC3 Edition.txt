Welcome to Computing Fundamentals! This book helps prepare you for success in 
a world that is filled with computers. At work, at school, at home, in stores, and as 
you travel, computers help make things run more smoothly.
Think about the average day in your life, all the places you go and all the things 
you do. How many of those involve a computer of some type? Probably quite a 
few. For example, you might wake up in the morning to the sound of a digital 
alarm clock. As you eat breakfast, you might browse the day’s news on your home 
computer or a tablet PC. The vehicle you ride in to work or school probably has 
at least one computerized component in it, and perhaps as you travel you talk to 
a friend on your cell phone. When you get to work or school, your supervisor or 
teacher might use a computer to assign work to you, or to teach a lesson. On the 
way home, you might stop at a restaurant where a cashier inputs your order into 
a computer-based ordering system that then relays your order to the kitchen staff 
in the back. Before you go to bed, you might watch a DVD movie using a DVD 
player and a digital TV, both with computers in them.

Part I: Computer Basics and Hardware
In this chapter, you will learn the basics that most computer systems have 
in common, whether it’s a desktop PC, a smartphone, or the software in 
your car that tells you it’s time for an oil change. You’ll find out how com-
puters represent, encode, and process data, and how they communicate 
with one another. Many of the topics that this chapter covers in overview 
form are explored in greater detail later in the book.
Understanding Information Systems
An information system is a complete interconnected environment in 
which raw data—quantifiable facts and figures—is turned into useful 
information. An information system includes the following parts: people, 
hardware, software, procedures, and data (see Figure 1.1).
◾	 People: If you think about it, the only reason computers exist is to 
help people accomplish their goals. Therefore when planning an 
information system, it’s critical to understand what the people hope 
to get out of it. Do they need certain information? Do they need 
for the computer to activate a device that performs a task? Are they 
looking to be entertained or educated? The first step in planning an 
information system is to analyze the requirements of the people.
◾	 Hardware: When most people think of computers, they immedi-
ately think of hardware, the physical parts of the computer system. 
The hardware includes circuit boards with silicon chips and transis-
tors mounted on them, input devices like keyboard and mouse, and 
output devices like printers and monitors.
◾	 Software: Computer hardware just sits there idle unless it has 
software, which is a program that tells the hardware what to do. 
There are many different levels of software, including the operat-
ing system (like Windows or Mac OS) and applications (like a word 
processing or accounting program).
◾	 Procedures: The software doesn’t run itself (usually). People must 
interact with the computer to tell it what software to run. For 
example, before you can write checks with your accounting soft-
ware, you must start up the software, open the file that stores the 
data for the business, and issue the command that opens the check-
ing account register. You can learn procedures from the online 
Help system in the application, from a printed user manual, from a 
training class, or by trial and error.
◾	 Data: Computer programs operate upon the data they receive. For 
example, in your accounting software, you enter data about the 
checks you are writing—the date, the amount, the recipient—and 
the program stores that data so you can recall it later.
information system An interconnected envi-
ronment for managing and processing data using 
a computer.

Information Systems Manager
An Information Systems (IS) manager looks at the “big picture” of 
a company’s computer systems. As you discover in this chapter, an 
information system consists of people, procedures, software, hard-
ware, and data The IS manager is the person who brings them all 
together to get results. An IS manager might oversee an initiative 
to satisfy an information need, such as for production managers 
to receive daily reports. This initiative might include assembling a 
team of programmers, identifying the required hardware and soft-
ware, developing procedures for handling the information request, 
and delivering the data to the managers in an easy-to-use format.

Quick Review
	 1.	 What are the five parts of an information system?
Identifying Computer Types
As you learned in the preceding section, hardware is the physical part of 
the computer system. Hardware consists of components inside a com-
puter as well as the external devices that interact with it, such as printers, 
cables, and monitors.
hardware The physical parts of the computer 
system.

Part I: Computer Basics and Hardware
Personal Computers
When most people think about computers, they picture a personal 
computer, or PC. This type of computer is called personal because it is 
designed for only one person to use at a time. Personal computers fall 
into several categories that are differentiated from one another by their 
sizes. The most common sizes are:
◾	 Desktop PC: A com-
puter designed to be 
used at a desk, and 
seldom moved. This type 
of computer consists of a 
large metal box called a 
system unit that con-
tains most of the essen-
tial components, with a 
separate monitor, key-
board, and mouse that 
all plug into the system 
unit (see Figure 1.2).
◾	 Notebook PC: A 
portable computer 
designed to fold up like 
a notebook for carrying, 
as shown in Figure 1.3. 
The cover opens up to 
reveal a built-in screen, 
keyboard, and point-
ing device, which 
substitutes for a mouse. 
This type of computer 
is sometimes called a 
laptop. A smaller version 
of a notebook PC is 
sometimes referred to 
as a netbook (which is 
short for Internet book, 
implying that this type of computer is primarily for accessing the 
Internet rather than running applications).
◾	 Tablet PC: A portable 
computer that consists of 
a touch-sensitive display 
screen mounted on a 
tablet-size plastic frame 
with a small computer 
inside, as in Figure 1.4. 
There is no built-in key-
board or pointing device; 
a software-based key-
board pops up onscreen 
when needed, and your 
finger sliding on the 
screen serves as a point-
ing device.
personal computer A computer designed to be 
used by only one person at a time.
desktop PC A computer designed to be set up 
at a desk and not often moved, with input and 
output devices separate from the system unit.
system unit The main part of the computer, 
containing the essential components.
notebook PC A portable PC where the screen 
and keyboard fold up against one another for stor-
age and transport; also known as a laptop.
pointing device An input device such as a 
mouse or touchpad that enables users to move 
an onscreen pointer to select content and issue 
commands.
netbook A small notebook PC designed primarily 
for accessing the Internet.
tablet PC A lightweight slate-style computer with 
a touch screen, designed for easy portability.

Chapter 1: Computer Basics
◾	 Smartphone: A mobile 
phone that can run com-
puter applications and 
has Internet access capa-
bility (see Figure 1.5). 
Smartphones usually 
have a touch-sensitive 
screen, provide voice 
calls, text messaging, and 
Internet access. Many 
have a variety of loca-
tion-aware applications, 
such as a global posi-
tioning system (GPS)  
and mapping program 
and a local business 
guide.
Multi-User Computers
Multi-user computers are designed to serve groups of people, from a 
small office to a huge international enterprise. Here are some common 
types of multi-user computers:
◾	 Server: A computer dedicated to serving and supporting a network, 
a group of network users, and/or their information needs. Many 
networks employ servers to provide a centrally accessible storage 
space for data, and share common devices like printers and scanners. 
A small network server may look similar to a desktop PC, but may 
have a different operating system, such as Windows Server or Linux. 
A large server that manages a wide-ranging network may look 
similar to a mainframe. A group of servers 
located together in a single room or facility 
is called a server farm, or server cluster. 
Large Internet service provider (ISP) com-
panies maintain extensive server farms.
◾	 Mainframe: A large and powerful computer 
capable of processing and storing large 
amounts of business data. For example, 
a mainframe might collect all the sales 
data from hundreds of cash registers in a 
large department store and make it avail-
able to executives. The modern mainframe 
unit itself is a large cabinet, or a series of 
cabinets, each about the size of a refrigera-
tor (see Figure 1.6). A mainframe may be 
stored in its own air-conditioned room in a 
business or school, and may have multiple 
employees monitoring and maintaining it. 
In earlier decades, smaller and less expensive 
multi-user computers called minicomput-
ers were employed in many businesses, but 
minicomputers are no longer widely used.
smartphone A cellular phone that includes com-
puter applications and Internet access capability.
global positioning system (GPS) A device 
that determines your current position by communi-
cating with an orbiting satellite and provides maps

◾	 Supercomputer: A supercomputer is the largest and most powerful 
type of computer available, occupying large rooms and even entire 
floors of a building. Supercomputers are often employed in fields 
such as cryptanalysis (code breaking), molecular modeling, weather 
forecasting, and climate mapping. Supercomputers typically are 
used in high-tech academic, governmental, and scientific research 
facilities. Figure 1.7 shows a supercomputer.

Put It to Work
Mapping the Human Genome
Supercomputers played a critical role in the Human Genome Project 
(HGP), a multi-national research project that sought to define the 
unique genetic sequences that comprise the 23 chromosome pairs of 
human DNA. The project began in the 1980s, and by April 2003, 99% 
of the human genome had been mapped with 99.99% accuracy. Work 
continues on genomes today, with thousands of human genomes 
completely sequenced and many more mapped at a more basic level. 
The power of a supercomputer was essential for processing the 
enormous amount of data. The data that this project collected may 
help researchers develop cures for diseases like cancer, as well as 
promote advances in biotechnology and molecular medicine.

	 2.	 What key characteristics of a desktop PC distinguish it from a notebook PC?
	 3.	 What are the differences between a server, a mainframe, and a supercomputer?
Understanding Software Types
Software tells the hardware what to do, but different kinds of software 
accomplish that at different levels. The following sections provide an 
overview of the types of software a computer might include.
BIOS
The most basic software is the Basic Input Output System (BIOS). 
This software is stored on a read-only chip on the motherboard so that 
it doesn’t accidentally get changed or corrupted. This important soft-
ware helps the computer start up and performs some basic testing on the 
hardware.
Operating Systems 
The operating system (OS) manages all the computer’s activities after 
startup. The operating system serves several purposes:
◾	 It provides the user interface that humans use to communicate 
commands and receive feedback.
◾	 It runs applications, and enables humans to interact with them.
◾	 It controls and manages the file storage system.
◾	 It communicates with the hardware, instructing it to take action 
to accomplish tasks. For example, the OS tells the printer to print a 
document, and tells the monitor what image to display.
Microsoft Windows is the most popular operating system; Figure 1.8 
shows the Windows 7 interface. Other operating systems include Mac 
OS and Linux for desktop and notebook PCs, UNIX for mainframes 
and servers, and Android for tablets and smartphones. Special versions of 
Windows and Mac OS also power tablets and smartphones. Each operat-
ing system has its own unique set of features, benefits, and drawbacks, so 
it pays to learn as much as you can about the operating systems available 
and choose a computer that will run the operating system that best fits 
your needs. You will learn much more about operating systems in general 
in Chapter 4, “Operating System Basics,” and more about the Windows 7  
interface in Chapter 5, “Introduction to Windows 7,” and Chapter 6, 
“Windows 7 Administration and Maintenance.”
software The programs that tell the computer 
what to do.
BIOS The software that initializes and tests the 
system at startup.
operating system Software that maintains the 
computer’s interface, manages file, runs applica-
tions, and communicates with hardware.

Step by Step
Identifying Your Windows Version
Each version of Microsoft Windows is 
available in various editions; Windows 7  
comes in several editions includ-
ing Home Basic, Professional, and 
Enterprise, for example. Use this pro-
cedure to determine what version and 
edition of Windows you have on your 
computer: 
	 1.	Click the Start button. Right-
click Computer, and choose 
Properties. (Right-click means 
to press only the right side of 
your mouse.) An information 
page appears.
	 2.	Look under the Windows Edition 
heading. The version and edi-
tion of your Windows operat-
ing system appear there. If a 
service pack is installed, that 
information also appears.
This book uses Windows 7 for all its 
examples.

Chapter 1: Computer Basics
Utilities
In addition to the main components of an operating system, utility 
software may also be available, either provided free with the OS or 
added on. Utility programs assist with a wide range of system mainte-
nance and security functions, such as checking storage disks for errors, 
blocking security and privacy threats, and backing up important files.
Application Software
Application software is software that is designed to do something pro-
ductive or fun, something of interest to a human user. The OS keeps the 
computer running, but the applications give people a reason to use the 
computer.
Most computers come with some application software already installed. 
You can purchase additional software, and many applications are available 
for free. The software may be provided on a CD or DVD disc, or may be 
downloaded and installed over from the Internet.
Productivity software helps you accomplish practical tasks such as man-
aging your money, charting numeric data, writing documents, storing 
data, and sending email. Perhaps the best known example in this soft-
ware category is Microsoft Office, a suite of applications that includes 
a word processor, a spreadsheet application, a database application, an 
application for creating business presentations, and an email and contact 
management system. A suite is a group of applications that are designed 
to work well together and which share some common interface charac-
teristics. Notice in Figure 1.9 that each of the three applications has a 
similar toolbar across the top.
Figure 1.9  These Microsoft Office applications—Word, Excel, and PowerPoint—share a 
­common interface.
utility software Software that performs some 
useful service to the operating system, such as 
optimizing or correcting the file storage system, 
backing up files, or ensuring security or privacy.
application software Software that helps a 
human perform a useful task for work or play.
productivity software Software that helps a 
human perform one or more business or personal 
enrichment tasks.
Microsoft Office A productivity suite of applica-
tions commonly used in businesses for word 
processing, spreadsheets, databases, presenta-
tion, and email.
suite A group of applications designed to 
complement each other’s capabilities and work 
together closely, often with a consistent interface 
between the applications.

20
Part I: Computer Basics and Hardware
In addition to general suites like Office, dozens of other types of productiv-
ity software perform functions specific to certain professions, like accounting, 
customer relationship management (CRM), and appointment scheduling. 
On the technical side, software is available to help engineers and technicians 
create technical drawings and blueprints, develop new computer software, 
operate manufacturing and testing machinery, and much more.
New Technologies
Using Online Apps 
Did you know that you can also use some software without installing it on your computer? Software as a Service 
(SaaS) is a new way of thinking about accessing and paying for software. Rather than buying a software product 
once, installing it on your computer and “owning” it forever, with the SaaS model you pay a usage fee for the 
software, which remains the property of the company. The software and any associated data are stored online. The 
company provides free updates for as long as you keep renewing your usage. Microsoft Office can optionally be 
rented this way through the Office 365 program, and many other applications are also being offered as services. 
SaaS has many benefits. The cost is typically lower than for buying the software outright, and updates and new ver-
sions are free and automatically provided.
Software as a Service (SaaS) A model of 
software sales that leases access to the software 
rather than selling a copy outright to the user.
Applications can also assist in education and training. For example, 
applications can train employees to perform new tasks or to use new 
productivity software, and can test their understanding of the training by 
administering and auto-scoring quizzes. In schools, applications can be 
used to simulate laboratory experiments and experiences, to assist with 
note-taking and review, and to help instructors create multimedia learn-
ing materials that students can use at their own pace. Some classes are 
even delivered entirely online through web-based software.
Applications can also entertain. You can find a wide variety of appli-
cations related to virtually any interest—cooking, sports and fitness, 
photography, science, and thousands more topics. There are thousands 
of games designed for every age group and interest, from simple match-
ing and memory games to epic fantasy adventures to realistic first-person 
shooting games. In Chapter 6 you’ll learn about the Entertainment 
Software Ratings Board (ESRB) and the rating system it assigns to games 
to help make sure that children have age-appropriate games.

Chapter 1: Computer Basics
Computer System Components
Every computer system is made up of multiple electronic components. 
These components fall into four broad categories that serve different 
purposes in the information processing cycle, shown in Figure 1.10. 
You will learn more about the information processing cycle in Chapter 2, 
“The System Unit.”
Figure 1.10  The information processing cycle.
◾	 Input: Components that help humans put data into the computer. 
Examples include a keyboard, mouse, and touch screen.
◾	 Processing: Components that move and process the data inside the 
computer. The motherboard and its processor and memory chips 
fall into this category.
◾	 Output: Components that provide the results of the processing to 
humans. The monitor is the primary output device; other examples 
include printers and speakers.
◾	 Storage: Components that store software and data until it is 
needed. Storage components include hard drives, USB flash drives, 
and DVDs.
As you learned earlier in this chapter, the system unit is the main box 
that constitutes the computer. Some devices are external—that is, they 
are outside the system unit—and some are internal. On a desktop PC, 
most input and output devices are external; on a notebook, tablet, or 
smartphone, they are an integral part of the device but external devices 
can be added. Figure 1.11 shows the computer’s main components and 
their roles in information processing.
information processing cycle The four-step 
process that data moves through as it is pro-
cessed by a computer. Consists of input, process-
ing, output, and storage.

How Data Is Represented on a Computer
The smallest unit of data in a computer is a bit. A bit is a single binary 
digit, with either a 1 (on) or 0 (off) value. Eight bits can combine 
to make a byte, which is an 8-digit binary number, as shown in 
Figure 1.12 
Figure 1.12  Computers combine eight binary digits (bits) to make a byte.
Modern systems work with thousands, millions, and even billions of 
bytes at a time. Table 1.1 lists the names for certain multiples of bytes.
bit A single binary digit, with a value of either 1 
(on) or 0 (off).
byte An 8-digit binary number, composed of 
eight bits.

Petabyte (PB)
1,125,899,906,842,624 (approximately one quadrillion)
NOTE
Both memory and storage capacities are measured in bytes. For example, a computer might have 8GB RAM 
(memory) and a 500GB hard drive.
Input Devices
An input device provides a way to get data into the computer. The old-
est and most common input device is a keyboard. A desktop PC has an 
external keyboard, while a notebook PC has a built-in keyboard. Tablets 
and smartphones have a software-based keyboard that pops up onscreen 
when needed.
Computers that use a graphical interface usually employ a pointing 
device. The pointing device moves an on-screen pointer (usually an 
arrow) to align with objects onscreen, and then the user presses a but-
ton on the pointing device to do something to the pointed-at object. A 
mouse is the most common pointing device, but there are many other 
types too, such as trackballs, touchpads, and touch-sensitive screens. You 
will learn more about input devices in Chapter 3, “Input, Output, and 
Storage.”
Processing Devices
The motherboard is the large circuit board inside the computer that 
everything else plugs into. The key components located on the moth-
erboard are the processor (also called the Central Processing Unit, or 
CPU) and the memory (also called Random Access Memory, or RAM). 
To support these components, the motherboard has electrically conduc-
tive pathways called buses that carry the data from place to place, and 
a chipset, which is a controller that directs the bus traffic. Figure 1.13 
shows a motherboard removed from the computer case so you can see it 
more clearly.
Chapter 2, “The System Unit,” covers these components in more detail 
and explains how they work together.
keyboard An input device that allows users to 
type data into a computer using a standard set of 
typing keys.
motherboard A large circuit board inside a 
computer that controls the operations of all other 
components.
processor The chip in the computer that 
performs math calculations, processing data. Also 
called the Central Processing Unit (CPU).
memory Temporary electronic storage that holds 
the values of data bits using transistors.
bus A conductive pathway built into a circuit 
board, used to move data.
chipset The controller chip on a circuit board.

slots to the side of the CPU will hold the small circuit boards containing memory.
Output Devices
Information comes out of a computer through an output device such as 
a monitor. When you move the mouse or type a character on a key-
board, you see the results instantly on the monitor. The monitor helps 
you communicate with the operating system; without the monitor, you 
wouldn’t know if the OS had received and understood your instructions 
or if the application had accepted the data you input. Besides monitors, 
other output devices include printers (for producing hard-copy output) 
and speakers (for providing audio feedback).
Storage Devices
Storage devices enable software and data to be preserved and reused. 
Storage can be either removable or non-removable. (Non-removable stor-
age is actually removable too if you have the right tools and knowledge, 
but in this case the distinction refers to being easily removable or not.)
The most common type of storage is an internal hard drive, which is a 
sealed metal box inside the system unit. Hard drives are usually internal, 
making them non-removable. Some hard drives are removable, though; 
external hard drives easily connect to and disconnect from a port on the 
outside of the system unit. Other removable storage devices include USB 
flash drives and optical discs (CDs and DVDs). Chapter 3 covers storage 
devices in more detail, and explains the technologies behind them.
monitor A display screen on which a computer’s 
output appears.

puter data using either mechanical or solid-state 
technology.

Chapter 1: Computer Basics
How Computers Communicate
Early computers did not communicate easily with one another. Data was 
typically carried between computers on floppy disks and other low-capacity 
removable disks, or using slow dial-up modems. Network connections 
were difficult to set up and transferred data very slowly. Nowadays, how-
ever, communication technology has advanced greatly, and there are many 
choices for making computers connect to one another.
Ethernet Networking
Most computers today are part of one or more networks. A network is a 
group of computers that share resources (such as printers or Internet service) 
and/or data (such as files). The most common network standard is Ethernet. 
Ethernet networks can be either wired or wireless (or a combination of the 
two), but the term Ethernet is most often applied to the wired kind of con-
nection. Figure 1.14 shows an Ethernet port on the side of a notebook PC. 
Most PCs have a network adapter, which provides network connectivity 
services and a port into which you can plug an Ethernet cable. The most 
common kind of Ethernet cable uses twisted pairs of copper wiring and an 
RJ-45 connector, which is like a telephone connector except slightly wider.

Figure 1.14  Ethernet is the most common type of network connection. Most computers 
have an Ethernet port.
Wireless Ethernet is more often called Wi-Fi, or 802.11. That number 
refers to the standard number assigned to it by the Institute of Electrical 
and Electronics Engineers (IEEE, pronounced “eye-triple-ee”). Different 
Wi-Fi sub-types have different letter designations, such as 802.11g or 
802.11n. Most portable devices such as tablets and phones use wire-
less connections and do not have the capability for wired networking. 
Chapter 13, “Networking and Internet Basics,” explains networking 
technology in more detail.
In a small network, such as in a home or small business, one end of an 
Ethernet cable plugs into the computer, and the other end plugs into a 
network Two or more computers connected to 
share data and resources.
Ethernet The current dominant standard for local 
area networking devices.
network adapter A hardware component that 
enables a computer to connect to a network.

IEEE 802.11, its technical standard.

controller box called a router that manages the network traffic between 
the connected devices. If you have broadband (always on) Internet 
access, the device that brings that service into your home or business is 
frequently called the router, and then the router shares the Internet con-
nection among all the computers.
If you have a Wi-Fi wireless router and a wireless network adapter in the 
computer, the computer can connect to the router via radio frequency (RF) 
waves, so no cables are required.
In large-scale networks, Ethernet is still the standard, but some different 
hardware is employed. Large panels of switches can connect hundreds 
of computers into a central network system, as shown in Figure 1.15. 
Cables with fiber optic technology are used in the network’s backbone 
to carry large amounts of network traffic faster and more efficiently.
Some networks, such as small home and business networks with fewer 
than a dozen or so computers, are peer-to-peer. That means there is no 
one computer that controls the network; all the computers can cooperate 
to share data with each other. Networks that are larger than that typically 
have one or more servers dedicated to network data sharing, and such 
networks are called client/server networks.
Bluetooth Networking
Bluetooth is a short-range wireless alternative to wireless Ethernet 
­(Wi-Fi), used primarily to connect wireless devices directly to specific 
computers. For example, you might have a Bluetooth wireless headset for

that physically joins the devices in the network

computers on the same network; a decentralized 
network.

tains one or more servers.

ing technology used for computer-to-device 
connections such as computer-to-printer or

your cell phone, or a Bluetooth speaker for your MP3 player. Bluetooth’s 
limited range (10 meters) makes it impractical as a replacement for 
Wi-Fi, but it provides an easy and economical way for one device to con-
nect with another within a limited space without Ethernet hardware.
The Internet
The Internet is the world’s largest network. When you use the Internet, 
your computer becomes a member of this giant network, and you can com-
municate with any other computer on the Internet, to the extent that its 
owner has chosen to make it available. For example, you can exchange email 
messages, download files, and view web pages stored anywhere in the world.
Individual computers don’t connect directly to the Internet, however; 
they go through an Internet service provider (ISP), a company that 
provides a connection to the Internet for a fee. Your ISP may be your 
local phone or cable TV company, or at work it may be a service that 
your school or employer partners with. An ISP provides a device (a 
modem or terminal adapter) that translates your computer’s requests 
into Internet-compatible data.
Internet A global packet-switched network 
created cooperatively by multiple companies, 
governments, and standards organizations.
Internet service provider (ISP) A company 
that maintains a direct connection to the Internet 
and leases access to it to individuals and 
companies.
Wireless Router Security
A wired router is fairly secure by nature because you have to have physical access to it to plug a cable into it. A 
wireless router, however, is not secure because anyone within transmission range can connect to it. Wireless rout-
ers come with optional security features you can enable that will assign a code (like a password) that is required 
for a computer to connect to it. The first time that computer connects to the router, a prompt appears for the code; 
after the first successful connection, the code is stored and the computer can connect to the router automatically.
If you do not enable security on your wireless router, you should make sure that you do not have file sharing 
enabled on any of your computers. Otherwise an unknown person could not only use your Internet connection 
without permission, but could also view, change, copy, and even delete your important data files. An intruder 
might also be able to gather enough information about you from your data files to steal your identity.
To enable security on a wireless router, check the documentation that came with the router. You will find instruc-
tions there to open a web browser and go to an IP address for the router to display a web page on which you can 
change router settings and set up security.
Privacy and Security
The Internet functions using a set of standards called Transmission 
Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). It is this shared com-
munication language that makes global communication possible. TCP/
IP defines how data will be treated as it is broken up into packets for 
transmission, sent through a series of routers across the world, and reas-
sembled into its original form at the receiving end.
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet 
Protocol (TCP/IP) The protocol suite (set 
of rules) that defines how data will move on the 
Internet and on most other modern networks.

Summary
Understanding Information Systems
An information system is a complete interconnected environment in which raw data—quantifiable 
facts and figures—is turned into useful information. An information system includes the following 
parts: people, hardware, software, procedures, and data.
Identifying Computer Types
A personal computer (PC) is a computer designed for only one person to use at a time. Examples 
include desktop PCs, notebook PCs, tablet PCs, and smartphones. Other computers support 
multiple users at once, including servers, mainframes, and supercomputers.
Understanding Software Types
Software tells the hardware what to do. The operating system (OS) manages the computer’s 
activities. An operating system provides a user interface, runs applications, manages files, and com-
municates with hardware.
Application software is software that is designed to do something productive or fun. Productivity 
software helps you accomplish practical tasks; one example is the Microsoft Office suite. A suite 
is a group of applications designed to work together. Software may be bought on CD or DVD, 
downloaded and installed, or may be leased as Software as a Service (SaaS).
Computer System Components
The information processing cycle consists of these four parts: input, processing, output, and 
storage. Each component in a computer contributes to one or more parts of that cycle.
Input devices move data into a computer. Examples include a keyboard and mouse. A mouse is 
a type of pointing device; pointing devices move the onscreen pointer and select objects onscreen.
Processing components manipulate the data inside the PC, and include the motherboard and its 
processor, memory, chipset, and buses.
Output devices deliver the results of the processing to the user. The monitor (display screen) is 
the most common output device; others include speakers and printers.
How Computers Communicate
Most computers are part of one or more networks. The most common network standard is 
Ethernet, which can be wired or wireless. Wireless Ethernet is called Wi-Fi. To connect to a net-
work, the computer needs a network adapter (wired or wireless). A home network uses a router to 
connect the computers to one another and to connect to a shared broadband Internet connection 
if available.
Large networks use multiple banks of switches to connect the computers together, and may use 
fiber optic cable for the backbone portions of the network that need high data throughput.
Small networks (fewer than a dozen computers) may operate in peer-to-peer mode, where all 
computers share with each other. Larger networks use a client/server management method where 
one or more dedicated computers function as servers.
Bluetooth is a short-range wireless alternative to Wi-Fi, used primarily to connect wireless devices 
directly to specific computers.

Think It Over
Software as a Service
Suppose you had the chance to buy a productivity suite like Microsoft Office for a certain price 
and keep that version indefinitely, or to subscribe to a service that enabled you to use Office for as 
long as you continued paying the subscription fee. Suppose that the subscription cost was 1/20th 
per month of the cost to buy it outright. Which would be a better value for you, and why?
What if it were a game that you could either buy or subscribe to? Would you rather buy it outright 
and be able to play it forever, or would you rather subscribe to it?
Shopping for Tablet PCs
Suppose you are shopping for a tablet PC for use in your classes. Using the Internet, research 
at least one model of iPad, one tablet that has the Windows 8 OS, and one model that uses the 
Android OS. Then answer the following questions:
◾	 Which tablet has the fastest processor and the most memory?
◾	 Which tablet OS has the most apps available for it? 
◾	 Which model has the longest battery life?
◾	 Which tablets have the capability of attaching external keyboards?
◾	 Which tablet has the largest screen size and the highest resolution?
◾	 What features do you personally find most important, and which model would serve those 
needs best?

Sharing Wi-Fi
Suppose your family pays for broadband Internet service, and you have a wireless router that 
allows everyone in the family to share the Internet connection. The wireless router has security 
on it, so that a code is required to connect to it. This prevents your neighbors from using your 
Internet connection without permission. A neighbor asks for the code so he and his family can use 
your Internet connection. What do you say? Explain how you came to your decision.
◾	 No, it would be unfair to the ISP for you to use the Internet without paying for it. You must 
pay for your own separate connection.
◾	 Yes, you can use it, but you must pay me for part of the expense of the service.
◾	 Yes, you can use it for free. Here is the code.
◾	 Some other answer (explain).

The heart of any computer is its system unit. As you learned in Chapter 1, 
“Computer Basics,” the system unit is the main body of the computer, containing 
the essential components it needs to function.
If you have ever shopped for a computer, you probably noticed that some mod-
els cost much more than others—many times more. The quality and features of 
the components inside the system unit are the primary reason why cost varies so 
widely. Two computers can look identical from the outside but be very different in 
their capabilities and performance levels.
In this chapter, you will learn what happens inside the system unit, and what role 
each key component plays in making the computer fast and efficient at performing 
the tasks you ask of it. When you understand these things, you will be able to deci-
pher a computer’s technical specifications with confidence and select the models 
that have the best balance of cost and features for your situation.

Understanding CPUs
Every computer has at least one processor, also called a central process-
ing unit (CPU). The CPU contains millions of tiny transistors and 
pathways that take in data and instructions, process (calculate) the data 
according to the instructions, and output the results of the calculations. 
A computer may also have smaller processors used in specific subsystems, 
such as a graphics processor.
Every CPU includes the following components:
◾	 The control unit manages the flow of data through the CPU. It 
directs data to and from the other components within the CPU.
◾	 The arithmetic logic unit (ALU) component does the actual pro-
cessing. It receives data and instructions and delivers a result. For 
example, if it received the numbers 3 and 5, and the instruction 
Sum, it would return 8.
◾	 Registers are holding areas for both data and instructions. There 
are many different registers, each with its own special purpose. 
For example, there are registers that hold data, registers that hold 
instructions, registers that store logical states (yes/no), temporary 
values that serve as increment counters, and so on.
Figure 2.1 walks through a very simple example that takes two numbers, 
divides one by the other, and outputs the result. Numbers are shown in 
decimal form in this diagram, but in actuality all numbers and instruc-
tions would be represented as binary codes.

processor in a computer.
Careers in IT
Bench Repair Technician
A bench repair technician is like a mechanic for comput-
ers. As the word bench implies, this technician works 
primarily at a workbench in a repair shop, although mobile 
repair technician positions are also available. Bench 
repair technicians can diagnose system problems with 
computers that customers bring in for repairs, including 
both hardware problems like defective parts and software 
problems like virus infections. This position requires 
either a two-year degree in Computer Technology or a 
professional certification such as CompTIA’s A+ certifica-
tion. It is a good job for someone who prefers working 
mostly with the computers themselves rather than with 
their users.

Chapter 2: The System Unit
Figure 2.1  Data and instructions enter the CPU and are processed, producing output.
The Machine Cycle
The process of accepting input, processing it, and ejecting output is 
sometimes referred to as a machine cycle. A machine cycle consist of 
these steps:
	
1.	Fetch: The control unit requests that the data and instructions it 
needs be fetched from memory and moved into the CPU.
	
2.	Decode: The control unit translates the instructions into a form 
the ALU understands.
	
3.	Execute: The ALU processes the instructions.
	
4.	Store: The control unit releases the result from the CPU, and it is 
stored in memory.
Figure 2.2 illustrates this cycle. You can also trace the same basic proce-
dure in Figure 2.1 to understand how the parts of the CPU relate to the 
activities. The CPU performs billions of machine cycles per second, with 
the exact timing being determined by the system clock (also called the 
system timer), a chip on the motherboard that provides the timing for all 
the system components to operate, as a metronome might do.
machine cycle One complete cycle of the 
CPU’s activities of fetching, decoding, executing, 
and storing.
system clock A crystal on the motherboard that 
sets the timing for data moving through the sys-
tem, such as between memory and the CPU. This 
chip contains a crystal that oscillates at a certain 
frequency to produce the timing pulses.

36
Part I: Computer Basics and Hardware
Figure 2.2  A machine cycle consists of these four steps.
Physical Composition of a CPU
Physically, a CPU is a very small and thin sheet of semiconductor mate-
rial (usually silicon) with a complex array of tiny transistors and buses 
stamped into it with a die. Semiconductor material is used for CPUs 
because it does not affect the flow of electricity one way or another: it 
neither conducts it nor impedes it. The components inside the CPU are 
so small that you need a microscope to see them.
The CPU is fragile, so it is protected by a sturdy ceramic and metal 
casing; some models are mounted on miniature square circuit boards. 
The underside of this casing contains either tiny pins or tiny metal dots, 
precisely spaced, that align with connectors on the CPU socket on the 
motherboard. Each pin or each dot is a separate communication line, 
carrying a different piece of data. Figure 2.3 shows both sides of a CPU 
designed for a desktop PC, for example. CPUs come in different sizes 
and have to match the socket type on the corresponding motherboard.
Cores
Most modern CPUs have multiple cores, so they can complete multiple 
tasks simultaneously, as if they physically were more than one CPU. A 
core consists of a separate set of the essential processor components 
(control unit, ALU, and registers). Most models of the Intel i7 processor 
have four cores, for example. All of the CPU’s cores are located on the 
same chip.

neutral, neither a good conductor nor a flow 
preventer.

that work together (control unit, ALU, and regis-
ters). A CPU may have multiple cores.

Caches
In theory, the CPU is capable of executing a function with every tick of 
the system clock (called a clock cycle). However, in practice, the CPU 
sometimes is idle because there is a delay between the request for data to 
be retrieved from memory and its delivery. The bus (pathway) between 
memory and the CPU is not as fast as the CPU’s internal speed, so 
several clock cycles may pass when the CPU is idle. A delay caused by 
waiting for another component to deliver data is called latency.
To help minimize latency, CPUs have caches. A cache is a small amount 
of very fast memory located near (or within) the CPU. Data that the 
CPU has recently used, or is predicted to need soon, is placed in the 
cache for temporary holding. That way, if the CPU calls for the data, it’s 
more readily available and there is less delay.
CPUs have a multi-level cache system. Whenever the CPU needs some 
data, it first checks the Level 1 (L1) cache to see if it’s there. If the CPU 
does not find what it needs in the L1 cache, it checks the L2 cache. This 
cache is also on the CPU itself. Finally, if the L2 cache does not have it, 
the CPU checks the L3 cache.
How much of a difference can the caches make? A big difference: 
Fetching data from an L3 cache takes 10 times as long as from an L1 
cache. See Table 2.1.
clock cycle One tick of the system clock.
latency A period of waiting for another compo-
nent to deliver data needed to proceed.
cache A small amount of fast memory located 
near or within the CPU.

38
Part I: Computer Basics and Hardware
All of these caches are located on the CPU itself on modern CPUs. 
Older CPUs have only two cache levels, with the L3 being on the mother­
board. On CPUs with multiple cores, each core has its own L1 cache. 
The L2 cache might also be individual to each core, or two cores might 
share an L2 cache. The L3 cache is shared among all cores.
A smaller cache is quicker to check because there’s less data to go 
through, so the Level 1 (L1) cache is fairly small, and each of the 
other two caches is progressively larger. The cache sizes vary by CPU 
model. The Intel Core i7 CPU, for example, has an L1 cache of 64KB 
per core, an L2 cache of 256KB per core, and a shared L3 cache of 
between 4 MB and 8 MB.
CPU Performance Factors
The most obvious performance factor for a CPU is its maximum speed, 
measured in billions of hertz, or gigahertz (GHz). Although the 
actual speed is dictated by the motherboard’s system clock, each CPU 
has an advertised maximum speed, which is the highest speed at which 
the CPU’s manufacturer assures that it will reliably function. If a CPU 
is pushed to run faster than its rating (for example, by putting it in a 
motherboard that runs the CPU faster), it is said to be overclocked. An 
overclocked CPU is more prone to overheating, processing errors, and 
reliability issues.
A CPU’s word size also makes a difference. The word size is the num-
ber of bits that the CPU (or a single core of the CPU, if multi-core) can 
accept as input simultaneously. Most desktop and notebook PCs have 
64-bit CPUs, but some tablets, netbooks, and smartphones have 32-bit 
CPUs; see Figure 2.4.

activity speed.

TIP
Windows 7 comes in both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) versions. When selecting a copy of Windows for a 
device, keep in mind that 32-bit CPUs can only run the 32-bit version of Windows. 64-bit CPUs can run either 
64-bit or 32-bit versions of Windows, but run better with the 64-bit.

39
Chapter 2: The System Unit
Figure 2.4  64-bit CPU has twice the word size of a 32-bit CPU, so the 64-bit CPU can 
theoretically input and output date at twice the rate. In actual use, many other factors also 
play a part, so the performance boost is less than 2x.
Because modern CPUs have many technology improvements in them, 
speed and word size alone do not form a reliable benchmark of a CPU’s 
capability. Another way to look at performance is how many instructions 
per second the CPU can process. For example, suppose you have two 
CPUs that both have a speed rating of 3.4 GHz. If each one processed 
one operation per clock cycle, with no delays and with a single core, each 
one might be able to output 3.4 billion operations per second (usually 
expressed as Giga instructions per second, or GIPS). However, one of 
them might have multiple cores, multiplying that theoretical maximum. 
And, realistically, there is always going to be latency, no matter how effi-
cient the processing technology becomes. Each CPU will also have some 
advanced data handling technologies that reduce the average latency (the 
idle time waiting for data) by differing amounts.

performance.
instructions per second A measurement of a 
CPU’s throughput capability, taking into consider-
ation factors such as number of cores and latency.
Benchmarking
It can be difficult to fairly compare 
one CPU to another in terms of 
performance. Benchmark software 
is available that runs a series of 
processing tests on a system and 
creates a report and a numeric 
score based on those tests. Such 
software also test other subsys-
tems, such as graphics processing, 
because other hardware besides 
the CPU makes a difference in how 
an application performs as well. 
One popular benchmark program is 
SiSoftware SANDRA. Its Lite version 
is free for personal and educational 
use. See www.sisoftware.net

Part I: Computer Basics and Hardware
The two largest manufacturers of CPUs are the companies Intel and 
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Their CPUs are roughly equivalent in 
performance level, but the internal architectures of the CPUs are differ-
ent. A motherboard will support one or the other, but not both. Some 
people prefer one brand over the other, and claim that one brand or 
model is superior for using a certain kind of software. Such claims are a 
moving target, though, as each company continues to develop new and 
better CPUs.

Understanding Memory
The word memory has a biological origin, of course, referring to the 
way human brains store memories and learned facts. In computer terms, 
memory is an electronic chip with integrated circuits that store on/off 
values, as you learned in Chapter 1, “Computer Basics.” Like the human 
brain, memory stores and retrieves data. Also like human memory, there 
is both short-term (temporary) and long-term (permanent) memory 
storage. Some memory is dynamic, in that it stores data only until the 
computer is turned off. Dynamic memory (also called volatile memory) 
must be constantly refreshed. Static memory (also called non-volatile 
memory) retains whatever you put in it indefinitely; the transistors do 
not require constant electrical power to retain their contents.
Another way to classify memory is whether it can be overwritten with 
new data or not. Random Access Memory (RAM) can be rewritten 
freely; Read-Only Memory (ROM) cannot (at least not in the same 
way that RAM can; see the following Note). All ROM is static, but RAM 
can be either dynamic (more common) or static.
dynamic memory Memory that does not 
retain its data unless it is constantly electrically 
refreshed.
static memory Memory that retains its data 
without electricity being constantly applied.
Random Access Memory (RAM) Memory 
that can have its values changed freely, an unlim-
ited number of times.
Read-Only Memory (ROM) In general, 
memory that cannot be rewritten. However, there 
are exceptions to that in newer types of ROM.
NOTE
When is ROM not really read-only? Actually plenty of times. Over the years, as technology has advanced, 
companies have figured out ways to make certain types of ROM chips rewritable. The first generation used 
a special machine that reprogrammed the chips; this type of ROM was called Erasable Programmable ROM 
(EPROM). Later ROM chips were erasable with strong electrical pulses; this was called Electrically Erasable 
Programmable ROM (EEPROM); this technology was used to allow the BIOS chip on a motherboard to be 
updated without having to remove it.
The early versions of EEPROM could only erase and rewrite the entire chip at once, but newer versions allow 
specific blocks to be rewritten while preserving the data in other blocks. This advanced ROM-rewriting tech-
nology is used in USB flash drives and solid-state hard drives. Unlike RAM, which can be rewritten unlim-
ited times, there is a limit to how many times an EEPROM can be rewritten, but the limit is very high (up to 
100,000), so it is seldom an issue.
Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM 
(EEPROM) ROM that can be erased and repro-
grammed with electricity.

Chapter 2: The System Unit
How Computers Use Memory
Computers use different types of memory in various ways. 
Here are some of the most common memory uses:
◾	 System memory: The main memory in a computer 
system, such as the RAM installed on the PC’s moth-
erboard, is dynamic RAM (DRAM). System memory 
is installed in slots on the motherboard, perpendicu-
lar to the motherboard itself.
◾	 Component memory: Many components have a 
small amount of memory built in for their own use. 
For example, a printer might have RAM that holds 
the information about the page it is printing, and 
a display adapter might have memory to hold the 
data about the image it is displaying on the monitor. 
Component memory is typically DRAM unless the 
component’s function requires it to be otherwise 
because that’s the least expensive kind.
◾	 ROM-BIOS: A motherboard has an EEPROM chip 
that contains the low-level startup instructions for the 
hardware. To prevent corruption that would prevent 
the system from starting up, this chip is not rewritable 
except with a special utility program.
◾	 Caches: The L1, L2, and L3 caches in a CPU are a 
type of static RAM (SRAM).
◾	 USB flash drives, memory cards, and solid-state 
hard drives: As mentioned in the earlier note, these 
devices use a type of EEPROM to store data. This type 
of EEPROM is also called flash memory; its enhanced 
technology allows data to be written and rewritten to it 
multiple times.
Understanding System Memory
Each computer has a certain amount of system memory, also called 
RAM or main memory. It is dynamic RAM (DRAM), so it loses its con-
tents if it is not constantly being electrically refreshed.
System memory forms a workspace that the operating system uses. When 
you open an application, that application is placed in system memory, 
and when you open a data file, it is placed there too. When you make 
changes to a data file, those changes wait in memory until you write 
them to a more permanent storage area by saving your work. The more 
system memory you have, the more applications and files you can have 
open at once.

RAM (DRAM) on the motherboard.

NOTE
Windows also uses virtual memory to help prevent a computer from running out of memory. Virtual memory 
is a file on the hard drive used as an extension to main memory. This file is called the paging file or swap 
file. When the physical memory gets full (or nearly full), Windows moves some data to the paging file on the 
hard drive. It then makes a note of where the data came from and where it is now, and then frees up that 
space in memory to hold something else. When a program requests that data, Windows moves something 
else out of memory, swaps the old data back in again, and then responds to the request. Virtual memory is 
much slower than regular memory because the hard drive is a relatively slow device, so it’s not desirable to 
use—but it’s better than running out of memory entirely and not being able to do more work without closing 
some programs. The more physical memory a PC has, the less it needs to rely on virtual memory. That is why 
adding more physical memory to a computer improves its performance.
virtual memory Memory that is simulated 
by swapping data out of memory and storing it 
temporarily on the hard drive.
paging file The area of the hard drive set aside for 
use as virtual memory. Also called a swap file.
The data in RAM is assigned a specific location, known as a memory 
address, and the operating system maintains a database of what data 
is stored where. Any data can go into any area of the RAM, depend-
ing on what’s free at the moment. That’s why it’s called random access 
memory—because the system can access any area in RAM as easily as any 
other area.
memory address The numeric address of a 
particular addressable area in memory.

Chapter 2: The System Unit
Physically, system memory comes mounted on small rectangular circuit 
boards called dual inline memory modules (DIMMs). These circuit 
boards fit into memory slots on the motherboard. There are different 
types and speeds of DIMMs, so you must match the memory to the 
motherboard’s requirements. Figure 2.5 shows two different types of 
DIMMs. As you can see, some DIMMs are bare circuit boards, while 
others have a metal plate covering most of the DIMM. Each ceramic 
chip mounted on the DIMM contains a silicon wafer, the memory itself. 
For notebook computers, small outline DIMMs (SO-DIMMs) are 
used instead; they do the same thing as DIMMs but are a different size 
and shape. Figure 2.6 shows a SO-DIMM.

Figure 2.6  A small outline DIMM (SO-DIMM) is used in notebook computers.
System memory actions are synchronized with the system clock in 
modern PCs, just as the actions of the CPU are. Therefore, the system 
memory used in today’s systems is often referred to as synchronous 
dynamic RAM (SDRAM).
The slowest and most basic type of SDRAM is single data rate (SDR). 
This RAM moves one word of data per tick of the system clock. SDR 
SDRAM is found only in older systems.
Double data rate (DDR) SDRAM performs two actions per clock tick. 
DDR2 SDRAM doubles that even further, and can perform four actions 
per clock tick, and DDR3 SDRAM doubles it again, to eight actions. 
You might guess that DDR4 doubles it again, but it doesn’t; DDR4 
contains some technical improvements over DDR3 but keeps the same 
data rate. Each type of DIMM has a different number of pins, so these 
DIMMs aren’t physically interchangeable. A motherboard typically sup-
ports only one type of DIMM.

Part I: Computer Basics and Hardware
Memory capacity is described in bytes (usually megabytes or gigabytes). 
SDRAM DIMMs come in different capacities, such as 2GB or 4GB. An 
average desktop PC might have 4GB to 8GB of system memory, which 
might be installed in either two or four DIMM slots.
Troubleshooting
Upgrading Memory
Don’t assume that you can add more memory to your computer. Some computers may already have the maximum 
memory installed that their motherboard will accept. And in other systems, upgrading the memory means replacing 
the currently installed memory with higher-capacity DIMMs. Suppose you have a desktop PC with two RAM slots in 
the motherboard, and each slot currently contains a 2GB DIMM. If you want to upgrade to more RAM, you would 
need to remove the 2GB DIMMs and replace them with 4GB DIMMs—assuming, of course, that the motherboard 
supported 4GB DIMMs, which isn’t a given. You would need to check the PC’s documentation, or look up the moth-
erboard’s specs online. You might be able to trade in the 2GB DIMMs at a computer shop for a discount on the 
4GB DIMMs, or you might be able to sell them to some other computer user.
TIP
The 32-bit version of Windows can support only 4GB of RAM. If your computer has more than that, make sure 
you have the 64-bit version of Windows or some of your RAM will be unused. Sometimes the motherboard has 
a limit on the amount of RAM that can be recognized, so check this before you rush out and buy more RAM.

	 3.	 In SDRAM, what does the “S” stand for, and what does it mean about the speed at which the RAM operates?
Understanding Motherboards
Both the CPU and the memory plug into the motherboard. Motherboards 
vary in many ways, including the CPUs and memory they support, the 
technology used in their chipset, the expansion slots they have, and the 
external ports they support.
The motherboard’s capabilities are determined by its chipset. The 
chipset contains the controllers that direct the traffic along the mother-
board’s buses, specify which memory and CPUs the motherboard can 
accept, and route data to expansion slots and ports as needed.
A motherboard typically supports only one brand of CPU, and only a 
limited array of specific CPU models (usually one or two models with 
allowances made for various speeds). It also usually supports only one 
kind of RAM, in a few different capacities. Table 2.2 lists the specifica-
tions for an Intel motherboard, for example. Figure 2.7 shows a mother-
board that is similar to the specs shown.

Form Factor
The form factor of the motherboard is its physical size and shape. It is 
significant because the motherboard must be able to physically fit into 
the system unit case. The motherboard described in Table 2.2 supports 
several different CPUs, but most of them are the same basic CPU at dif-
ferent speeds: the Intel i7.

Expansion Slots
Expansion slots are plastic slots on the motherboard. Inside the slots are 
metal contacts that connect with metal contacts on smaller circuit boards 
called expansion cards that fit into them. There are many expansion 
devices you can buy, adding capabilities that might not be built into the 
motherboard, or adding a more feature-rich version of a built-in device. 
For example, you might add a Wi-Fi adapter to a desktop PC with an 
expansion card, or a dial-up modem, or you might replace the on-board 
display adapter built into your motherboard with a model that has a 
faster graphics processor.
Different motherboards have different numbers and types of slots. Each 
slot type has its own separate bus, delivering its own combination of 
width and speed. Recall from Chapter 1 that a bus is a data pathway 
within a circuit board. Some buses are parallel, meaning they can carry 
multiple bits simultaneously. For example, the system bus is usually 
64-bit. Other buses are serial, meaning they are only one lane, and carry 
only one bit at a time.
The motherboard described in Table 2.2 has three expansion slots: one 
conventional Peripheral Component Interface (PCI) slot (an older 
type of slot, for backward compatibility with older devices) and two of a 
newer type, PCI Express (PCIe). PCIe slots come in different widths, 
such as x16 (16 channels, used mostly for display adapters) and x4 and 
x1 (used mostly for non-display components). Those numbers refer 
to the number of channels of data that can be carried simultaneously. 
Figure 2.8 shows some slots in a different motherboard; this one has one 
x1, one x4, and two x16 slots, as well as one regular PCI slot.

Figure 2.8  PCI and PCIe slots in a motherboard.
Notebook PCs are more likely than desktops to have a wide variety of 
built-in components, so there is less need for expansion slots. That’s 
good, because there’s not much room for them.

Peripheral Component Interface (PCI) 
A motherboard slot that accepts PCI expansion 
boards. PCI is considered a legacy interface 
(mostly obsolete).
PCI Express (PCIe) A new and updated 
version of the PCI motherboard slot. Different 
numbers of channels are used in different sized 
PCIe slots, such as 16, 4, or 1.

Chapter 2: The System Unit
On a notebook PC, there might be an externally accessible expansion 
slot called an ExpressCard slot. ExpressCards are small circuit boards 
encased in a metal cartridge. They add device capabilities to notebook 
PCs in much the same way that expansion slots do in desktop PCs. Over 
the last two decades, there have been other versions of this same basic 
technology, called PC Card and CardBus, which accepted slightly dif-
ferent sized cards. ExpressCard slots are waning in popularity and many 
new notebook computers do not have them.
There also might be a removable panel on a notebook PC with a PCI 
Express Mini Card socket, into which you can install a small expansion 
board that uses the motherboard’s internal PCIe bus. One common use 
for this type of socket is to add a Wi-Fi adapter. Figure 2.9 shows a PCI 
Express Mini Card and its connector.

Built-in Components
Notice that the motherboard described in Table 2.2 also has built-in 
components for video, audio, and networking. Having these compo-
nents built in means that you don’t need to buy separate circuit boards 
for those capabilities, and you don’t need expansion slots for such cards. 
That is one reason the motherboards in Table 2.2 and Figure 2.7 don’t 
have many expansion slots—they don’t need many because the three 
most commonly added expansion features are already built in.
	 Each of those three built-in components has its own external  
	 ports built into the motherboard. The display adapter may have a 
Digital Visual Interface (DVI) connector, a Video Graphics Adapter 
(VGA) connector, or both. DVI is the newer, digital type of monitor 
connector used with digital monitors (which include most flat-screen 
LCD monitors); VGA is the older, analog type used with the boxy 
older CRT style of monitor and with some older or inexpensive LCD 
monitors.

Express Mini expansion bay to add a capability to 
the computer, such as wireless networking.

Part I: Computer Basics and Hardware
The audio component support results in several small (3.5mm) 
round external connectors for plugging in speakers, headphones, 
and microphones. They are usually color-coded: pink for microphone, 
green for speakers or headphones, and blue for line input.
The Ethernet support results in an RJ-45 jack as an external 
connector. An RJ-45 jack looks like a telephone connector but is 
slightly wider and has eight metal contacts in it, rather than the two or 
four of a telephone connector.
Other Common External Connectors
	 The motherboard described in Table 2.2 has only a few types of 
external ports, which is typical of newer systems. Universal Serial Bus 
(USB) is the most common multipurpose port type; many devices use 
USB ports, including keyboards, mice, and printers. The word serial in 
the name refers to the fact that the data travels through the cable one bit 
at a time. There are different generations of USB, with different speeds. 
This motherboard’s USB ports are all version 2.0 (also called Hi-Speed 
USB). Table 2.3 notes the speed for each version.
Universal Serial Bus (USB) A general-purpose 
port for connecting external devices to a PC.
Table 2.3 USB Versions and Speeds
Version
Speed
USB 1.1
1.5 megabits per second
USB 2.0
48 megabits per second
USB 3.0
4 gigabits per second
NOTE
Data transfer speed from a serial device is usually expressed in bits, rather than bytes, as in Mbit/sec, which 
stands for megabits per second.
	 This motherboard also supports one IEEE 1394A port, also 
called a FireWire port. FireWire is a competitor to USB. It has not 
caught on quite as widely, but it is used for some external hard drives 
and digital video equipment.
Older systems may have a variety of other external ports, for backward 
compatibility with older devices. Motherboards with these older ports 
are still available today, but they are becoming less and less common. 
The most common legacy ports are:
	 PS/2 port: This is a small round port that used to be used 
for mice and keyboards before USB became popular. They are 
usually color-coded: purple for the keyboard and green for the 
mouse.
	 Parallel (LPT) port: This is a 25-pin connector, with the holes 
arranged in two rows. It used to be used for printers before 
USB became the dominant interface for printers. The port on 
the computer is a female connector, meaning it has holes; the 
IEEE 1394A A connector used to connect 
certain types of devices to a computer that require 
high-speed connection, such as some external 
hard drives and video cameras. A competitor to 
USB. Also called FireWire.
PS/2 port A connector used to connect some 
older keyboards and mice to a computer. PS 
stands for Personal System. This connector was 
first introduced with the IBM PS/2 computer 
in 1987.
parallel port A port used to connect some older 
printers to a computer. It is sometimes called an 
LPT port, which stands for Line Printer.

49
Chapter 2: The System Unit
connector on the cable that plugs into it is a male connector, 
containing pins that fit in the holes. This type of connector is 
sometimes called a DB-25 connector.
	 Serial (COM) port: This is a 9-pin connector (DB-9), with the 
pins arranged in two rows. It is a male connector on the moth-
erboard, and the cable that plugs into it is female. This type 
of port used to be an all-purpose port for a variety of external 
devices, much like USB is today.
Drive Connectors
Most motherboards have two types of drive connectors. The older type 
is Parallel ATA (PATA), and it is used with older hard drives and most 
CD and DVD drives. This type of connector has 40 pins arranged in two 
rows, and uses a ribbon cable to connect the device to the motherboard.
The newer type is Serial ATA (SATA), a more compact connector that 
uses a thin round cable. SATA is used with newer hard drives. You will 
learn more about drive connectors in Chapter 3, “Input, Output, and 
Storage.”
serial port A port used to connect some 
very old external devices to a computer. It is 
sometimes called a COM port, which stands for 
Communications (although actually many types of 
ports operate serially, not just this one).
Parallel ATA (PATA) A type of connector used 
for older disk drives and optical drives such as CD 
and DVD drives.
ATA Short for AT Attachment. The IBM PC AT was 
an early type of computer (1984) that was among 
the first to support modern hard drive technology. 
Serial ATA (SATA) A type of connector used for 
newer disk drives.
Step by Step
Exploring Your Motherboard
Use this procedure to see what components and connectors your motherboard has. Use a desktop computer for this 
exercise.
	 1.	Shut down the computer, and open up the system unit. You may need a Phillips screwdriver. Ask your instructor for 
assistance if needed. Do not touch anything inside the system unit.
	 2.	Locate the following components. Ask your instructor to confirm that you are correct:
◾	 CPU (may be under a heat sink)
◾	 System memory
◾	 Built-in USB ports
◾	 Other built-in ports (name them if you can)
◾	 Expansion slots (identify the type if you can)
	 3.	Trace each cable from the motherboard to the components to see how components such as the hard drive and 
power supply attach to the motherboard.
	 4.	Close the system unit’s case and replace any screws you removed.

Understanding Power Supplies
The power from your wall outlet is alternating current (AC), and is 
either 110 volt (v) or 220v, depending on the country in which you live. 
Computer components require direct current (DC) and require much 
lower voltages. A power supply has two jobs:
◾	 It converts AC to DC power.
◾	 It decreases the voltage to the amount required for each component.
power supply A component that converts 
AC power from a wall outlet to DC power and 
decreases the voltage to the level needed for the 
computer to operate.
NOTE
Alternating current (AC) constantly switches the polarity between positive and negative through the wires. 
AC is able to travel great distances reliably and economically without losing its strength, which is why it is 
the type delivered to homes and businesses. Direct current (DC) does not alternate the polarity; the posi-
tive always sends power, and the neutral (ground) always receives it back. Batteries generate DC current, for 
example; DC power cannot travel very far without degrading.
In a desktop PC, a power supply is a large silver metal box mounted 
in one corner of the system unit, with many bundles of colored wires 
and connectors emerging from it (see Figure 2.10). The wire colors are 
significant; each wire color carries a different voltage. Each connector has 
the appropriate wires running to it to deliver the exact voltage required 
for each connected device. Table 2.4 summarizes the most common wire 
colors and their uses. Of these, the most common are the first three: red, 
yellow, and black. The connector shown in Figure 2.11, for example, uses 
one red wire, one yellow wire, and two black wires. The power comes in 
on the red and yellow wires, and the black wires are for grounding.
A desktop PC’s power supply has a fan in it, and when you start up the 
PC, the fan starts up too. The fan pulls hot air out of the power supply, 
and has a side benefit of circulating air through the entire system unit too.

In addition to the 
several types of 
connectors that go 
to internal devices 
such as drives, the 
power supply also 
has one big connec-
tor, containing 20 
or more wires 
arranged in two 
rows. Figure 2.12 
shows an example. 
This connector 
plugs directly into 
the motherboard, 
and powers all its 
components that

power connectors.

Figure 2.12  This connector runs from the power supply to the 
motherboard, delivering all the different voltages that devices that 
connect directly into the motherboard might need.
On a notebook PC, 
the power supply is 
built in. The power 
cord typically con-
tains a transformer 
block (sometimes 
called a brick) that 
steps down and 
converts the volt-
age. Figure 2.13 
shows an example. 
When a notebook 
PC is plugged into 
AC power, its bat-
tery recharges. The 
battery automati-
cally provides DC power at the correct voltage, so no power conversion 
is needed when running on battery power.

Troubleshooting Common 
System Unit Problems
When your computer won’t start up, it can be an annoying or even 
frightening experience. It is not always obvious what is wrong with it. By 
understanding some of the common symptoms of problems, however, 
you can make a more educated guess when problems occur, and you 
might even be able to fix the problem yourself.
No Response
If the computer doesn’t show any signs of life when you press its Power 
button (no lights and no fan noises), it is most likely not receiving 
electricity. Check the outlet, the power cord, and the power strip (if you 
are using one) to make sure there is no break in the connection. Some 
power strips have on/off switches.
© iStockphoto.com/BenThomasPhoto
Hold down the 
Power button on a 
PC for 10 seconds 
to shut it down 
completely, clear-
ing any possible 
problems it might 
be having with a 
low-power mode.
After you have 
confirmed that 
electricity is not the 
issue, try holding 
down the PC’s Power button for 10 seconds and then releasing it. Then 
press the Power button again normally to try again to turn the computer 
on. If the PC has placed itself into a low-power mode such as Sleep and 
gotten stuck there, holding down the Power button will turn off the 
computer completely, releasing it from that mode.
If you are working with a mobile device such as a smartphone or tablet, 
check online for instructions about how to do a system reset for your 
device. It may involve holding down multiple buttons at the same time, 
for example. Most devices have both a soft reset and a hard reset option. 
A soft reset restarts the device and preserves your data. A hard reset 
wipes out all the data and customization on your device, restoring it 
soft reset A device reset that retains all the 
device’s settings and data.

53
Chapter 2: The System Unit
to its original factory settings. A hard reset is sometimes necessary if a 
device locks up and can’t be revived; this can happen if a system update 
goes wrong, for example, or if you install an application that corrupts 
system settings.
A defective power supply, CPU, or motherboard can also cause a system 
to seem completely dead. If you have tried all the earlier suggestions, the 
next step is to consult a computer professional to help you determine the 
root cause of the problem.
Fan Noise but Nothing Onscreen
When you turn the computer on, if you see lights flash on its buttons or 
hear its fans spinning but you see nothing onscreen, the device is receiv-
ing power but it is unable to complete its power-on self test (POST). 
The POST is a software procedure built into the BIOS; the device must 
pass this basic internal testing before the operating system can load.
If you have this problem after installing new hardware, the new hardware 
is probably at fault. Try removing it and then restarting to see if the sys-
tem boots correctly without the device. Then try reinstalling the device. 
If the problem starts again, the device may be defective or incompatible 
with your computer.
As the computer starts up, it is normal for it to beep once. If you hear 
multiple beeps, you may have a problem with memory. You may have 
recently installed some memory that is incompatible with your mother-
board, or you may have installed it incorrectly.
Because there is no error message, this is a difficult type of error to 
troubleshoot on your own. A computer professional may want to use a 
POST card, which is an expansion board that fits into one of the moth-
erboard’s empty expansion slots. The card monitors the start-up process 
and displays a two-digit code that describes the point at which the start-
up process has stalled. The POST card comes with a manual that deci-
phers the codes. For example, the code may indicate that the memory is 
at fault, or the CPU, or the motherboard itself.
Error Message on a Black Screen
If you see some gray or white text on a black background, that’s good—
it means that your system passed its POST. If the start-up stalls in this 
mode, and displays an error message, it means that either your system is 
having a problem with a specific component or it can’t find and start the 
operating system. You might see a Keyboard Stuck message, for example, 
if you have something sitting on your keyboard that is making one or 
more of the keys seem pressed. A No Operating System or Non-System 
Disk Error message could mean that your hard drive does not contain an 
operating system, or it could mean that the start-up process could not 
find your hard drive. Perhaps it is defective, or perhaps its connector has 
come loose. A common reason for the Non-System Disk error is that 
hard reset A device reset that wipes out all 
custom data and settings, returning the device’s 
software to its factory-new condition.
power-on self test (POST) A low-level 
hardware test that occurs at start-up, before the 
operating system loads.

plays a numeric code that helps in troubleshooting 
errors where no text appears onscreen.

Part I: Computer Basics and Hardware
you may have left a USB flash drive or external drive connected and the 
system is trying to load the operating system from this device. Remove 
the device and then restart the system.
If you see an error message at start-up, research it online. You can usually 
find advice on the web that will help you troubleshoot.
Some of the solutions you may find online may suggest that you view or 
change settings in your CMOS Setup program (sometimes called BIOS 
Setup). This utility is built into your motherboard. You can access it at 
start-up by pressing the key that activates it. There should be a message 
onscreen at start-up telling you what key that is. (It might be F1, for 
example.) If you press this key quickly when you see that message, the 
BIOS Setup program starts.
CMOS Setup A built-in setup utility in the 
motherboard that enables users to adjust certain 
low-level configuration settings.
NOTE
Perhaps you are wondering why the motherboard’s setup utility is called CMOS Setup. CMOS stands for 
Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor. It’s a type of RAM chip that requires very little electricity to 
maintain. In the early days of PCs, the BIOS chip was completely unchangeable, so system designers needed 
a way to store the settings that users wanted to make to the low-level settings, such as the date, time, hard 
drive type, and so on. The motherboard had a CMOS chip that stored those settings, powered by a small bat-
tery on the motherboard. When the battery died, all your motherboard custom settings were erased and you 
had to reenter them. Motherboards no longer have CMOS chips today because the BIOS is on an EEPROM 
chip that can be updated, but the setup utility is still called CMOS Setup.
There are many different CMOS Setup versions, and they all work a little 
differently, so read the instructions onscreen for navigating the program. 
Figure 2.14 shows a generic example. You might be able to use the 
arrow keys on your keyboard to move a cursor around in the program, 
or you might be able to use your mouse to select options.
Figure 2.14  One example of a CMOS Setup utility; yours may look very different.

Chapter 2: The System Unit
Error Message on a Bright Blue Screen
If your operating system is Microsoft Windows, you might see a text 
error message with gray or white text on a bright blue background. This 
error usually reports a serious hardware or memory problem that prevents 
Windows from starting (or continuing, if you get this while Windows is 
already running). Some people call this type of message a “blue screen of 
death,” or BSOD. Figure 2.15 shows an example. All you can do when 
this error occurs is turn your computer off at the Power button, and 
then restart it and hope that the error doesn’t recur. If you see the same 
message multiple times, and you have recently installed new hardware, 
remove it; it is incompatible with your system or is malfunctioning. If you 
haven’t done anything different recently, look up the error message’s code 
online for troubleshooting help, or consult a computer professional.
Step by Step
Exploring Your CMOS Setup
Use this procedure to boot into CMOS Setup and see what settings can be changed.
	 1.	Restart your computer, and watch the screen carefully for a message that tells you what key to press to enter 
setup. It may be a function key (F1 through F12). When you see the message, press the key as quickly as possible. 
If Windows begins to start, you missed the opportunity; after Windows finishes loading, shut down and try again.
	 2.	In the CMOS Setup program, determine how to move between options. For example, you might use the arrow keys. 
Messages onscreen should instruct you.
	 3.	Determine how to change an option. For example, you might press Enter after highlighting an option to open a 
menu of choices, and then use the arrow keys to select one of the menu choices.
	 4.	Determine how to move between sections. Most CMOS Setup programs are organized into multiple sections or 
pages.
	 5.	Determine how to exit CMOS Setup without saving your changes. There should be an onscreen message with this 
information.
	 6.	Exit CMOS Setup without saving your changes.
The BIOS Setup program enables you to adjust low-level system settings 
that control how your motherboard works and how it interacts with the 
hardware. For example, you can change the boot order of the system, 
specifying which drive it should try to boot from first at start-up. You 
can also enable or disable built-in components such as video, audio, and 
networking; turn certain ports on and off; and control how the mother-
board reports the hardware to the operating system.
After making changes, exit the utility, saving your changes. It is usual for 
F10 to be the shortcut key for saving and exiting in CMOS Setup pro-
grams, but check for an onscreen message, as in Figure 2.14.

Windows Hangs at Start-up
If you get past the black or blue text-based screens to the Starting 
Windows graphic, but then Windows doesn’t start up correctly, the 
problem is likely a Windows setting. See the section “Troubleshooting 
Start-up and Performance Problems” in Chapter 6 for help starting the 
computer in Safe Mode and figuring out what driver or application may 
be causing the problem.
PC Shuts Down or Freezes
If your system frequently shuts down or locks up after it has been 
operating for about 10 to 15 minutes, overheating is the most 
common cause. Many of the components in the system unit get 
hot as they operate, especially the CPU, the graphics processor, and 
the larger chips involved in the motherboard’s chipset. Some chips 
that get especially hot have aluminum or copper blocks on top 
of them with baffles (ridges or wings) to increase the amount of 
surface that air touches, as in Figure 2.16. These blocks are called 
heat sinks; they work by channeling heat away from the hot com-
ponent; the air around the heat sink picks up the heat. In an active 
heat sink, a fan then blows that hot air away. In a passive heat sink, 
there is no fan; passive heat sinks rely on other fans nearby that are 
cooling the system unit in general to carry the heat away. If a com-
ponent is overheating, you may have a defective fan in one of your 
active heat sinks. Try looking inside the system unit when the PC is 
running to see if you can identify a fan that isn’t spinning. Another 
thing to check is to make sure the fan is not blocked with dust. The 
fans are designed to pull air in from the outside to cool the compo-
nents. They also import dirt and dust, which can block the fans.
heat sink A copper or aluminum block that 
diverts heat away from a heat-generating compo-
nent such as a CPU. When not paired with a fan, 
called a passive heat sink.
active heat sink A heat sink that is paired with 
a fan.

Summary
Understanding CPUs
A central processing unit (CPU) contains a control unit, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), 
and registers. They work together in a process called a machine cycle, which consists of fetching, 
decoding, executing, and storing. The CPU operates at the pace dictated by the system clock, 
executing billions of operations per second. One tick of that clock is a clock cycle. When the CPU 
sits idle during a clock cycle because it is waiting for data it needs, that wait time is called latency. 
To minimize latency, CPUs have multiple caches, including L1, L2, and L3.
Physically, the CPU is a semiconductor wafer of silicon. Most modern CPUs have multiple cores; 
each core has its own control unit, ALU, and registers. A CPU has a maximum speed, measured in 
gigahertz (GHz). When a CPU is run faster than it is rated for, it is being overclocked, and over-
heating and reliability problems can result. A CPU’s word size is the number of bits it can accept 
as input simultaneously. Modern CPUs in personal computers are usually either 32-bit or 64-bit. 
Windows is available in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. CPU performance can be described in the 
number of instructions per second it can process, but it is more reliably measured using bench-
marking software.
Understanding Memory
Memory can be either dynamic (losing its data when it loses power) or static (retaining its data). 
Random access memory (RAM) can be freely rewritten, and can be either static or dynamic. 
Read-only memory (ROM) is always static. Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM 
(EEPROM) is a type of ROM that can be changed with electricity; flash memory and solid-state 
hard drives employ a type of EEPROM.
System memory resides on the motherboard and is used as a work area for the operating system. 
Some components also have their own memory. Virtual memory is hard drive space that simu-
lates extra memory by allowing the operating system to swap data into and out of the real memory 
into a swap file.
Physically, system memory comes in dual inline memory modules (DIMMs). They are synchro-
nous with the system clock, making them synchronous dynamic RAM (SDRAM). SDRAM can 
be single data rate (SDR), double data rate (DDR), DDR2, DDR3, or DDR4. DDR RAM can 
perform two actions per clock tick.
Understanding Motherboards
The motherboard’s capabilities are determined by its chipset. A motherboard’s form factor is its 
physical size.
Motherboards have expansion slots, each type of slot having its own bus on the motherboard. 
Peripheral Component Interface (PCI) is an older type of expansion slot; a newer type is PCI 
Express (PCIe), which comes in a variety of sizes based on the number of channels, such as x1, 
x4, or x16. Some notebook computers have ExpressCard slots or PCI Express Mini Card slots.
Some of the ports that a motherboard may have built in include Digital Visual Interface (DVI) 
and Video Graphics Adapter (VGA) for video, 3.5mm analog plugs for audio, and RJ-45 for 
Ethernet networking. Internally, a motherboard has connectors for disk drives, including Parallel 
ATA (PATA) and Serial ATA (SATA).

59
Chapter 2: The System Unit
A Universal Serial Bus (USB) port is a general-purpose expansion port. There are three vari-
ants: 1.1, 2.0, and 3.0. Each has different speed capabilities, with USB 3.0 being the fastest. IEEE 
1394A, also called FireWire, is an alternative to USB, and is used on some external hard drives 
and digital video cameras. Older ports that a system might have include PS/2, parallel (LPT), 
and serial (COM).
Understanding Power Supplies
The computer’s power supply converts AC to DC power and steps down the voltage to the 
amount required. The colors of the wires on the connectors on the power supply are significant, 
indicating different voltages. On a notebook PC, a transformer block built into the power cable 
provides the same functions as the power supply in a desktop PC.
Troubleshooting Common System Unit Problems
If the computer has no power, check for electrical connectivity. Try holding down the power button 
on the computer for 10 seconds to clear any low-power mode the computer may have gotten stuck 
in. Find instructions in your device’s documentation to do a soft reset or hard reset as needed.
If you don’t see anything onscreen, your computer has failed its power-on self test (POST). A 
computer professional may be able to diagnose it with a POST card. Some fixes may require you 
to enter CMOS Setup to change or check a setting. A message at start-up will tell you what key 
to press to enter CMOS Setup. Overheating problems can occur when fans stop working, espe-
cially fans on active heat sinks.

Benchmarking
Download the free 2014 version of SiSoftware SANDRA, a benchmarking utility, from www.
sisoftware.net.
If you have time (at least 30 minutes), run the Overall Score test. If not, run only the Processor 
Arithmetic test and the Cache & Memory Latency tests. Examine the results, and compare them 
to the results of your classmates who are using different computers.
What is the Aggregated Score for processor arithmetic? This score is represented in GOPS (giga-
operation per second).
What is the rated speed and type of the CPU? In Windows, click the Start button, and then 
right-click Computer and choose Properties. Note the processor information that appears on that 
screen. Does it match what the utility detected?
What is the memory latency score? Notice the L1, L2, and L3 cache scores are expressed in 
“clocks.” This means that those caches, on average, take that many clock cycles to retrieve from. 
Compare the results to Table 2.1’s averages. How did your CPU’s caches do?
If time permits, run other benchmarks using this utility; your instructor may assign additional tests 
to complete.
Completing a System Inventory
Using the categories listed in Table 2.2 as a basis, create a description of your system’s mother-
board, as completely as you can describe it. If you can find its model number (usually stamped on 
the board itself), look it up online to see if its specs are available. If not, do your best to deduce its 
characteristics by looking at what ports are built in and by using the System Information utility in 
Windows.
Exploring Power Voltages
To do this exploration, you will need a desktop PC and a voltmeter (or a multimeter that measures 
DC volts). Your instructor may need to guide you through the process.
	
1.	Turn on your meter and set it to DC volts. You should have a red probe and a black probe.
	
2.	Open the system unit case, and locate the large connector that joins the power supply to the 
motherboard.
	
3.	Turn on the PC.
	
4.	Insert the black probe down into one of the sockets where a black wire connects, so that the 
probe touches the bare metal wire.
	
5.	Insert the red probe down into one of the sockets where a red wire connects, so that the 
probe touches the bare metal wire.
	
6.	Read the display on the meter. It should be approximately +5v.
	
7.	Repeat Steps 4–6 with several other wire colors, and record the readings you get.
	
8.	Turn off the meter and put it away.
	
9.	Turn off the computer, and close the system unit case.

Think It Over
Is Faster Always Desirable?
Is it important to you, when buying a new computer, to have the fastest and best CPU available, 
even if it costs more? Does it make more financial sense to pay more now for a CPU that will 
become obsolete less quickly a few years in the future? Or is it better to buy a lesser CPU, even if 
you have to replace the computer sooner because it will no longer be powerful enough to run the 
latest programs in a few years?
Shopping with Expandability in Mind
If you were buying a computer today, what expansion slots and ports would be important for your 
new computer to have, and why? That is, what device would you plan to install later that might 
need those slots or ports?
Self-Troubleshoot or Call a Professional?
Suppose your computer did not start up normally. How much time and effort are you willing to 
put into troubleshooting it yourself before you give up and involve a computer professional? Are 
you willing to spend an hour working on it? Two hours? Five or more? At what point it is worth 
the money to pay to have it fixed? There is no right or wrong answer, but explain your decision.

Chapter 2 explained the inner workings of a computer inside the mysterious box 
known as the system unit. In this chapter, you’ll look at how data moves into and 
out of that system unit—via input and output devices.
Different kinds of computers accept input from different sources. For example, a 
desktop PC might have a keyboard and mouse, whereas a tablet PC or smartphone 
might have a touch screen and some built-in buttons. Output can include messages 
and data that appear on the monitor screen, a hard-copy printout, and audio cues 
or prompts the computer might generate, such as a warning beep or the playback 
of your favorite song. Storage devices hold information for later use; they vary by 
capacity, by interface, and by the medium used to store the files.

Careers in IT
Database Administrator
Businesses store large amounts of data, and that data is often 
much more valuable than the hardware on which it is stored. 
Information about customers, orders, product inventory, suppliers, 
and market trends must be readily and reliably available for the busi-
ness to thrive. A database administrator is an expert in managing, 
summarizing, and safeguarding large amounts of data. Database 
administrators also plan and create well-organized database sys-
tems for storing new and existing data. For this career, a Bachelor of 
Science or Associate of Science degree in an Information Technology 
related field would be useful.

Selecting and Using Input Devices
Whenever you type a letter in a word processor, or issue the command 
to open or close the word processing program, you use an input device. 
Input devices allow the user to communicate with the operating system 
and applications. In this section, you will learn about several types of 
input devices.
Keyboards
A keyboard enables you to enter typed data—letters, numbers, and sym-
bols. A keyboard can be a separate device that plugs into the system unit (as 
with a desktop PC) or a built-in keyboard (as with a notebook PC).
There are many sizes and types of keyboards, but most English-language 
keyboards use the same key arrangement, called QWERTY. The name 
comes from the first six letter keys on the top row, from left to right. 
Figure 3.1 shows a QWERTY keyboard.
This type of keyboard has a number of specialty keys as well as the num-
bers, letters, and symbols. Specialty keys include:
◾	 Function keys (F1 through F12) perform special actions when 
pressed. The action assigned to each key depends on the operating 
system or application you are using.
input device Hardware that enables the 
computer to accept commands or data from a 
human user.
QWERTY The standard layout for English-
language keyboards.

Figure 3.1  The QWERTY keyboard layout.
◾	 Toggle keys turn a feature on or off each time they are pressed. For 
example, the Caps Lock key toggles between upper- and lowercase 
letter typing mode, and the Num Lock key toggles between the 
numeric keypad on the keyboard (if it has one) providing number 
entry or functioning as a set of directional arrows.
◾	 Modifier keys change the meaning of other keys when they are 
pressed in combination with them. For example, the Shift key, 
when pressed in combination with a letter, makes that letter upper-
case. Other keys, such as Ctrl and Alt, can be used with other keys 
to issue special command shortcuts. For example, a common key-
board shortcut in Windows 7 is Ctrl+C (press both keys simultane-
ously) for copying selected content.
NOTE
On a notebook computer, an Fn key may be present; it’s an extra modifier key that allows you to access special 
functions assigned to certain keys. For example, you might see a sun symbol and an up arrow on one of the func-
tion keys. You could hold down Fn and press that function key to increase the brightness of the display. Check the 
manual that came with your notebook computer to find out more about the actions you can take with the Fn key.
◾	 Positional keys such as the Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down 
keys, as well as the directional arrow keys, scroll the display or 
move the insertion point in applications.
insertion point The flashing vertical line that 
indicates where typed text will appear
NOTE
In Appendix B, “Customizing Windows 7,” you will learn how to set up the operating system to use alternative 
keyboard layouts for different languages.

A wireless keyboard does not require a cable connection to the com-
puter, allowing for greater ease of use. An ergonomic keyboard is a 
keyboard that is designed to minimize the stress on the user’s body (see 
Figure 3.2). It may have a built-in palm or wrist support, for example. 
A bilingual keyboard has characters in more than one language on its 
keys, so when you switch to a different keyboard layout in the operating 
system, the characters on the keyboard match what you are typing.

Step by Step
Using a Virtual Keyboard
Devices that don’t have physical keyboards, like tablets and smartphones, use a virtual keyboard, which is a software 
replica of a keyboard that pops up on the touch screen. Even if you have a regular keyboard, you can still try out a virtual 
keyboard in Windows if you like. Follow these steps to use the virtual keyboard in Windows 7:
	 1.	Click the Start button and type key and then click On-Screen Keyboard. A window appears showing a virtual 
keyboard.
	 2.	Open an application in which you can type text, such as Notepad. To open Notepad, click the Start button, type 
notepad into the Search field, and then click Notepad.
	 3.	Experiment with the keyboard by clicking keys to type the letters.
	 4.	When you are finished, click the Close (X) button in the upper-left corner of the On-Screen Keyboard window.
	 5.	Close the application you opened in Step 2 without saving your changes.

Chapter 3: Input, Output, and Storage
Pointing Devices
A pointing device is a piece of hardware that enables you to move an 
onscreen pointer in a graphical user interface like Microsoft Windows. 
A mouse is the most common pointing device. It is a palm-sized object 
that you move across a flat surface to move the pointer on the display. A 
mouse has one or more buttons on it; you press the buttons to act upon 
whatever the pointer is pointing at.
A mouse can be 
either mechani-
cal or optical. A 
mechanical mouse 
has a chamber on 
its underside with a 
rubber ball in it. As 
you roll the mouse 
across a flat sur-
face, the ball turns, 
activating sensors 
inside the chamber 
that translate the 
ball’s movement to 
onscreen pointer 
activity. An opti-
cal mouse has a 
light-emitting diode (LED) and a sensor on its underside, as shown in 
Figure 3.3. The light bounces off the surface and the sensor measures 
it, and those measurements are reported back to the computer to tell the 
pointer how to move. Mechanical mice need frequent cleaning; optical 
mice are maintenance-free and have virtually replaced the mechanical type.
Like a keyboard, a mouse can have a wire (cord) connecting it to the 
computer, or it can be wireless. A wireless mouse communicates with a 
transceiver connected to a USB port to exchange data with the com-
puter, or uses a technology called Bluetooth to communicate via radio 
waves. A wireless mouse requires a battery, whereas a wired mouse draws 
the small amount of power it needs from the computer via its cord.
Other pointing devices are also available. For example, a trackball is a 
stationary device with a ball on top (or on the side) that you roll with 
your fingers. See Figure 3.4. A trackball requires less space on a desk to 
operate and some people find it more comfortable to use than a mouse. 
Many notebook computers have a built-in touchpad, which is a small 
rectangular touch-sensitive pad with buttons below it. See Figure 3.5. 
You can drag your finger on the pad to move the onscreen pointer, and 
press the buttons to click.
Table 3.1 summarizes the actions you can take with pointing devices.
mouse A pointing device that the user moves 
with his or her hand across a flat surface to move 
an onscreen pointer.
mechanical mouse A mouse that operates by 
rolling a rubber ball inside a chamber containing 
sensors.
optical mouse A mouse that operates by 
bouncing light off a flat surface and measuring the 
reflection.
wireless mouse A mouse that communicates 
wirelessly with a transceiver connected to the 
computer, so it does not need a cord.
transceiver A unit that provides the wireless 
transmission for a cordless device like keyboard or 
mouse, usually plugged in to a USB port.

moves the pointer by rolling a ball with his or her 
fingers.

A joystick, shown in 
Figure 3.6, is a specialized 
pointing device used primarily 
in gaming. It consists of a ver-
tically mounted stick that can 
be tilted in any direction. A set 
of buttons on the base of the 
joystick enable you to perform 
actions, such as shooting or 
jumping in a game.
Drawing Tablets
A drawing tablet, also called 
a digitizing tablet, is a spe-
cialized type of touchpad 
designed for drawing. The 
user draws on the tablet 
with a pen-shaped pointer called a stylus, and the drawing shows up 
onscreen. Professional graphic artists use drawing tablets to draw directly 
into a computer program to create both technical and artistic drawings.

Sensory Input
Many portable devices, such as smartphones and tablets, have new types of input technology that detect direc-
tion, motion, and/or location. For example, some devices have a global positioning system (GPS) to detect your 
location, an accelerometer to tell how fast you are moving, a compass to report what direction you are facing, 
and a gyroscope to report the orientation of the device. It is the gyroscope, for example, that tells a phone or 
tablet when you turn it on its side so it can change the orientation of the screen.

Scanning Devices
A scanner digitizes hard-copy photos and documents and stores them 
electronically. Scanners work by shining a bright light on the surface of the 
page and measuring the amount of light that bounces back from it using a 
photosensitive charge-coupled device (CCD). Lighter areas bounce back 
more light than darker areas. For color scanning, multiple sensors are used, 
each one picking up a different color: red, green, and blue.
digitize To convert something from hard-copy to 
digital (computerized) form.
charge-coupled device (CCD) The light-
sensitive sensor in a scanner that records the 
amount of light bounced back from the image.
NOTE
A scanner can be a stand-alone device, or it can be a component in a multi-function device (MFD) that com-
bines the functions of a printer, copier, and scanner into one unit.
multi-function device (MFD) A device that 
combines the functions of a printer, a copier, and 
a scanner into one unit, and also a fax in some 
models.
Most scanners are flatbed models, as in Figure 3.8, where you place 
the image on a flat piece of glass and then a sensor and light bar moves 
beneath it to capture the image. A flatbed scanner may optionally have 
a document feeder on it so multiple pages can be queued for scanning. 
There are also smaller portable scanners that either feed in one sheet at a 
time past a stationary sensor and light bar, or that you hold in your hand 
and manually move across the image to be scanned.

Figure 3.8  A flatbed scanner.
When you scan text, you can use optical character recognition (OCR) 
software to convert the scanned image to text that you can work with in 
a text editing program.
flatbed scanner A scanner that has a large flat 
glass surface on which the page to be scanned 
is placed.
document feeder A mechanical feature of 
some scanners that enables multiple pages to be 
scanned consecutively without user intervention.
CAUTION
OCR software is not perfect; it sometimes makes mistakes in conversion, so you must proofread scanned 
text carefully.
One very simple type of scanner is a bar code reader, shown in 
Figure 3.9. Bar codes are vertical stripes of varying widths and spaces 
that represent numeric values. The most common type of bar code is a 
Universal Product Code (UPC), the bar code that identifies a product 
that consumers buy at a store.
bar code reader A scanner that reads and 
interprets bar codes such as UPC symbols.
Universal Product Code (UPC) A bar code 
system used for identifying products for sale.

73
Chapter 3: Input, Output, and Storage
A bar code reader 
examines the bars 
and inputs their 
numeric values into 
the computer. A 
bar code reader can 
be hand-held, like a 
gun-type unit that 
a warehouse worker 
might use to look 
up an item, or 
stationary, like the 
scanner in a grocery 
store checkout 
kiosk. Bar codes are 
used everywhere 
that numeric accuracy is important for tracking physical items. For exam-
ple, they are used in many manufacturing businesses to track parts, finished 
products, and orders. Shipping services use them to track the packages as 
they move from their origin to their destination, and retail stores use them 
at the cash registers to scan purchased items and look up their prices.
QR code (which stands for 
Quick Response) is a new type 
of scanner-readable code that is 
replacing UPC codes in many 
places. It’s a two-dimensional 
barcode. Whereas a standard bar 
code is read in only one direction 
(analyzing the width and spac-
ing of the bars), a QR code is a 
square panel with encoded data 
in both directions. QR codes can 
store more data than bar codes, 
making them more useful for pro-
viding information about an item. 
Figure 3.10 shows an example of 
a QR code being scanned by a 
smartphone.

Put It to Work
Scanning QR Codes
Many smartphones with cameras have QR readers built into them, so your phone can serve as a QR scanner. When 
you scan a QR code that you see on an advertisement, for example, you might be taken to the company’s website 
or to a coupon for the product. If you have a smartphone, see if it has a code reader app. If it doesn’t, download a 
free one. Then locate a QR code (look in magazines, on billboards, on subways, and anywhere else that companies 
advertise) and scan it with your phone to see what happens.
Another type of 
scanner used in 
many businesses is 
a magnetic card 
reader, shown 
in Figure 3.11. 
You use one of 
these every time 
you swipe a credit 
card to pay for 
a purchase, for 
example. Magnetic 
card readers read 
the encoded data 
on the magnetic 
strip on the back of your credit card or ID card and transfer that data 
into a computer. Some credit cards have a radio frequency identifica-
tion (RFID) chip in them that enables you to pass them in front of a 
radio frequency card reader to read the card’s data without it physically 
touching a reader. RFID chips are also used in security systems to allow 
employees access to secure areas of a building if they are wearing an 
RFID-equipped ID badge.

Fingerprint Readers
A fingerprint reader is a type of biometric scanner—
that is, a scanner that scans something about a 
human body that is used to identify that person. Many 
computer systems use fingerprint readers as a form 
of user authentication. The fingerprint of the person 
logging in is compared to a database of pictures of 
the fingerprints of authorized users. Other types of 
biometric scanners include facial recognition, voice 
recognition, and retina scanners.

Chapter 3: Input, Output, and Storage
Certain industries 
use specialized scan-
ners to simplify data 
entry. For example, 
companies that 
grade standardized 
testing use an opti-
cal mark recogni-
tion (OMR) system 
that detects the 
presence of a pencil 
or ink mark on 
certain spots on a 
standardized form. 
Banking institu-
tions save time and 
cut down on entry 
errors by using a 
magnetic-ink character recognition (MICR) system to read the routing 
and account numbers on checks and deposit slips, as in Figure 3.12.
Capture Devices
The scanners you have learned about so far read existing data and scan 
existing photographs and documents. Image capture devices, on the 
other hand, capture new content.
A capture device can capture either still images or motion video. Some 
devices do both, but most are designed primarily for one type or another. 
A digital camera is designed primarily for still photos, and looks much 
like a film camera; a digital video camera is designed primarily for 
motion video. See Figure 3.13. Both work using the same basic tech-
nology; the digital video camera captures many frames (individual still 
images) per second and stores them in a single file. When you play back 
the still images in chronological order, the image appears to be moving. 
Digital video cameras can also capture sound to accompany the video 
clips, which can be played back synchronously with the images. Many 
modern smartphones have built-in cameras that can take still photos and 
record video clips.

Part I: Computer Basics and Hardware
Some digital video cameras 
are stand-alone; you can 
take them out into the world 
and capture video, and then 
connect the video camera 
to a computer to transfer, 
edit, and save the video clips. 
Other cameras are webcams, 
as in Figure 3.14, which 
are simple video cameras 
that lack their own stor-
age and capture controls. 
They remain permanently 
attached to the computer, 
and store their video clips or 
still images directly on the 
computer’s storage drives. 
They rely on video capture 
software on the computer to start and stop the capture process. 
Webcams are often used for online video chatting through services 
such as Skype.
Audio Input Devices
Most personal computers support audio input, either through a built-in 
audio adapter on the motherboard or through an add-on sound card. 
A computer’s audio ports may support speakers, headphones, microphones, 
and both analog and digital external audio device input. An example of 
an external audio input device is a home stereo system; an external digital 
audio device might be a digital piano keyboard.
If you have a microphone and voice input software, you can speak into 
the microphone to issue commands to the computer and to input text 
into a word processing program. Some people with disabilities use voice 
input to control the computer as a substitute for a keyboard or mouse, 
and some people who have a lot of text to enter but don’t type very 
quickly may find voice input more efficient than trying to type all the 
text. People who use audio input frequently find that it is worthwhile 
to buy a high-quality microphone headset, as in Figure 3.15, because it 
provides more accurate voice pickup.
There are two kinds of voice input software: voice recognition and 
speech recognition. Voice recognition software recognizes spoken 
words that match words in its database. It does not pay attention to 
the tone or inflection of the speaker’s voice. People who speak with 
a heavy accent may have difficulty with such software. Voice recogni-
tion is included with Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office. Speech 
recognition software is teachable software that learns an individual’s 
pronunciation and vocal inflection. Each user trains the software by 
reading long passages of text into the microphone; the software records 
what each word sounds like when that person pronounces it, and can 
also learn new words.

connected to a computer as it operates.

component of a computer system that accepts 
and processes audio input and delivers audio

Selecting and Using Output Devices
Output devices make the computer’s processed information available to a 
human user. Without output devices, there would be little reason to have 
a computer, because it wouldn’t produce anything you could use. The 
most common types of output devices are display screens, printers, and 
speakers.
Display Screens
A display screen is a video screen that the computer uses to provide 
information to a human user. A display screen can be built into a device, 
as it is with smartphones, tablets, and notebook PCs, or it can be a sepa-
rate unit (a monitor), as it is with the majority of desktop PCs.
Display screens create their images by filling in tiny dots called pixels 
with different colors. The pixels are so small and so close together that 
the human eye sees them as continuous color gradients rather than indi-
vidual blocks. Monitors differ in the technology they use to illuminate 
those pixels.

uses to provide output to a human user.

or on a display screen.

Part I: Computer Basics and Hardware
Built-in display screens are thin 
and flat, and most of them use 
liquid crystal display (LCD) 
technology. Most modern 
stand-alone monitors are also 
LCD, like the one shown in 
Figure 3.16. This technol-
ogy has two polarized filters, 
with a liquid crystal substance 
between them. One filter is at 
an angle, so light doesn’t pass 
through it automatically. When 
electricity hits a crystal, it twists, 
refracting the light so that it 
passes through the second filter 
and lights up the display in a 
certain spot. Color displays 
have separate filters for red, 
green, and blue. Some new mobile devices use organic light-emitting 
diode (OLED) technology, which used organic matter that lights up in 
response to an electrical current.
Flat-screen displays vary in the number of transistors used to create the 
display image. In an active matrix, each individual pixel in the display 
is actively maintained by a separate transistor. Almost all LED screens 
today are an improved variant of an active matrix called thin-film tran-
sistor (TFT). In a passive matrix (which is cheaper to manufacture), 
each pixel maintains its state on its own until it decays or is refreshed. 
An OLED screen may be active matrix or passive matrix depending on 
the model.

NOTE
A high-definition TV (HDTV) can also be used as a computer monitor by connecting the computer to one of its 
high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI) input ports.

displays at least 1920 × 1080 resolution (also 
known as 1080p).
high-definition multimedia interface 
(HDMI) A type of connector used to connect an 
HDTV to another device, such as a computer or a 
home theater system.
Cathode ray tube (CRT) is an older monitor technology that uses 
a large vacuum tube and electron guns to create a display image on a 
phosphor-covered glass. See Figure 3.17. The electrons strike phosphors 
on the monitor glass and briefly light up. The display is refreshed many 
times per second to maintain the image. The phosphors are arranged 
in triads: red, green, and blue, as shown in Figure 3.18. Depending on 
what color a particular pixel should be, different phosphors illuminate 
within that triad. CRT monitors are heavy and bulky compared to LCDs, 
and have mostly been replaced by LCD monitors. You may still see one 
in use with an older computer, however.

Figure 3.17  A CRT monitor is housed in a large plastic boxlike case.
You also may encounter a few specialized monitor types. For example, 
some e-book readers have a special type of screen called electronic paper 
(e-paper). This type of screen retains its image but is unpowered except 
when the display changes, so it uses much less power than a device with 
an LCD screen. A digital or smart whiteboard is a large writing board 
in a conference room or other meeting area that is connected to a com-
puter, so that whatever is written on the board is also saved on the com-
puter. Digital tools and buttons also appear on the screen for interacting 
with the data collected, as shown in Figure 3.19. A digital projector 
(see Figure 3.20) accepts display data like a monitor does, but instead of 
showing the image on its own screen, it projects an image in large format 
on a nearby screen or wall.

NOTE
Digital projectors differ from one another in their brightness, measured in lumens. The brighter the projector, 
the better it will display when the image is projected at a large size in a well-lit room. An inexpensive projec-
tor having 1,500 lumens would be okay for a small, dark room; a more expensive projector might have 4,000 
lumens.
lumens The measurement of brightness of a 
digital projector’s image.
A display screen has a maximum resolution, which is the highest display 
mode it can support. Display modes are expressed as horizontal number 
of pixels × vertical number of pixels, such as 1600 × 900. On an LCD 
monitor, maximum resolution is sometimes called native resolution. See 
Figure 3.21.
resolution The number of pixels that comprise a 
display, horizontally and vertically.
maximum resolution The highest display 
mode (the greatest number of pixels) a display 
can support.
Figure 3.21  A screen’s resolution is described as horizontal × vertical pixels.
TIP
One quirk of LCD monitors is that if you use any resolution that is lower than the native one, the display may 
not appear as sharp and crisp. Therefore, you should run an LCD in its native resolution whenever possible. If 
the icons and text are too small to read, adjust the text and icon size in the operating system’s settings.
When selecting a display mode in the operating system, you should 
choose one that matches the aspect ratio of the display screen. The 
aspect ratio is the ratio of width to height—in other words, the relative 
dimensions of the screen. Some monitors have a traditional 4:3 aspect 
ratio, but many LCD screens use a wide-screen 16:9 aspect ratio instead.
aspect ratio The ratio of width to height on a 
display screen, such as 4:3 (standard) or 16:9 
(wide).

Chapter 3: Input, Output, and Storage
Resolutions and LCD Monitors
Most LCD displays look fuzzy 
at any resolution other than 
their highest one. However, the 
highest resolution display mode 
may make the text and icons so 
small that they are difficult to 
see and work with. As a work-
around, you can change the text 
and icon size in Windows. After 
switching to the highest resolu-
tion for your display, right-click 
on the desktop and choose 
Screen Resolution. Click the 
Make Text and Other Items 
Larger or Smaller hyperlink. 
Then choose one of the avail-
able sizes: Smaller, Medium, or 
Larger. You may have to restart 
your computer after making this 
change before the new setting 
will take effect.
Troubleshooting
All display screens have a maximum refresh rate, the number of times 
each pixel is refreshed per second. The operating system’s display mode 
determines the actual refresh rate that is used. On a CRT, using a high 
refresh rate (greater than 80 Hz) makes the monitor flicker less, result-
ing in less eyestrain for the user. On an LCD monitor, the refresh rate 
is somewhere around 60 Hz but is not as important because an LCD 
monitor is not prone to flickering.
A display mode specifies a color depth, which is the number of binary 
digits needed to uniquely describe the color of each pixel. For example, 
an 8-digit binary number has 256 possible combinations of 0 and 1, so 
8-bit color would allow for 256 different colors. Windows 7 defaults 
to 32-bit color that would allow for over four billion colors (also called 
True Color); an alternative is 16-bit color (also called High Color).
A display screen relies on the computer’s display adapter to tell it what 
to do. The display adapter, in turn, takes its orders from the operating 
system to specify the display mode (resolution, refresh rate, and color 
depth). The display adapter requires its own memory, which it uses to 
hold the color information for each pixel as it operates, and which it uses 
to render 3D objects and control special video effects in certain applica-
tions. If the display adapter is built into the motherboard, the display 
adapter may reserve some of the motherboard’s memory for its own use. 
If the display adapter is a separate circuit board, it has its own memory 
mounted directly on the circuit board.
refresh rate The number of times each pixel in a 
display is refreshed per second.
color depth The number of bits needed to 
describe the color of each pixel in a certain 
display mode, such as 16-bit or 32-bit.
display adapter The computer component that 
communicates instructions from the operating 
system to the display.

Follow these steps to see the current display settings in Windows 7:
	 1.	Right-click on the desktop and choose Screen 
Resolution.
	 2.	Make a note of the Resolution setting. Open the 
Resolution drop-down list and see what other set-
tings are available. Are you currently using the highest

	 4.	In the dialog box that appears, on the Adapter tab, click 
the List All Modes button.
	 5.	In the List All Modes dialog box and scroll through the 
list to see what modes your display adapter supports. 
Notice that a display mode consists of three factors: 
resolution (for example, 1600 × 900), color depth 
(for example, True Color [32 bit]), and refresh rate (for 
example, 60 Hertz).

Printers
Printers generate hard copy—that is, physical printed pages you can hold 
in your hands. Over the years there have been many different printer 
technologies, each with its own characteristics and benefits. In this sec-
tion, you’ll learn about several printer types and find out what differenti-
ates one printer from another.

ment or a printed photo; the opposite of soft 
(electronic) copy.

Printer Features
When selecting a printer, there are a number of factors to consider:
◾	 Initial cost: How much does the printer cost?
◾	 Per-page cost: How much does it cost to print a page, taking into 
account the price of the consumables? How much does the ink, 
toner, or ribbon cost, and how many pages will it print before you 
have to replace it? Are there other parts in the printer that wear out 
and have to be replaced after a certain number of pages?
◾	 Resolution: How many individual dots per inch (dpi) does the 
printed image consist of? A higher resolution results in a sharper 
image, as shown in Figure 3.22. A low-resolution printer might output 
at 300 dpi, while a high-resolution printer might output at 1200 dpi.
Figure 3.22  A high-resolution printout uses more pixels per inch, resulting in smoother 
lines and finer details.
◾	 Speed: How many pages per minute can the printer output? A typi-
cal printer might output at somewhere between 10 and 20 pages 
per minute for black-and-white, and slightly less than that for color.
consumables Printing supplies that must be 
replaced with use, such as paper and ink.
dots per inch (dpi) A measurement of printed 
image quality, the number of individually colored 
dots in one row (or column) of one inch of the 
printed file. A printout can have a different horizon-
tal and vertical dpi, although this is not common.
CAUTION
Keep in mind when comparing speeds that a printer’s advertised speed refers to its maximum output after it 
has started printing; this speed doesn’t take into account the time it takes for the computer to send the job 
to the printer and for the printer to process that data internally and start the printing process. If you print one 
or two pages at a time, you will not achieve the advertised speeds; it will likely take the printer 30 seconds or 
so to eject the first page of a print job.

84
Part I: Computer Basics and Hardware
◾	 Color: Does the printer print in color, or just in black-and-white? 
If it prints in color, can it print photos well? Some printers are 
designed specifically for photos, and have special inks for them 
and/or use special glossy paper for photos.
◾	 Paper handling: Does it have multiple paper trays, so you can 
have two sizes of paper loaded at once? How much paper can it 
hold at once? How well does it print on heavy cardstock or enve-
lopes without bending or creasing them? Does the printer have 
any special paper-handling features, such as the capability to print 
on both sides of the paper (duplexing) without the user manu-
ally flipping the paper over? What is the largest size paper it can 
accept?
◾	 Interface: Most printers use the USB interface to connect directly 
to a computer. Can the printer also connect to a network? Does 
it require a cable to connect it to the network, or can it connect 
wirelessly?
◾	 Multi-function: Is it just a printer, or can it perform other tasks 
too, like scanning, copying, and/or faxing? A multi-function device 
(MFD) can save you money and space if you would otherwise have 
to buy separate machines for those functions.
Table 3.3 at the end of this section compares the principal types of print-
ers along these factors.
Impact versus Non-Impact Printers
A printer can be either impact or non-impact. An impact printer creates 
the image on the page by striking the page through an inked ribbon. A 
non-impact printer places the ink on the page in some other way (for 
example, using heat or electricity), without striking the paper.
The only type of impact printer still sold today is dot matrix. In 
a dot matrix printer, the print head consists of a block of movable 
pins (which is, as the technology name implies, a matrix of dots). 
Depending on what letter it needs to form, it pushes different pins 
forward to form that letter, and then the exposed pins strike the paper 
through the ribbon to form that letter. The pins then pull back and dif-
ferent pins are pushed forward to form the next letter. Impact printers 
are slow and noisy, print only in one color, and do not print graphics 
very realistically. However, they do have one important benefit that 
non-impact printers lack: Because they strike the paper with some 
force, they can print on multi-part carbon copy forms. This capability, 
along with the low cost per page, have kept dot matrix printers from 
becoming completely obsolete. Figure 3.23 shows a close-up of the 
print head on a dot matrix printer.

cost per page The total cost of the consum-
able supplies required to print a page, calculated 
by dividing the cost of the paper and ink/toner/
ribbon by the number of pages it produces before 
being depleted.

that push forward to form letters. Note the inked ribbon between the head and the paper.
Inkjet Printers
An inkjet printer sprays liquid ink onto a page through a set of very 
small nozzles (ink jets). The depending on the model, an ink jet printer 
uses either heat or electricity to make the ink 
squirt out of the nozzles. Figure 3.24 shows 
an inkjet printer.
Most inkjet printers are color models, hav-
ing four separate ink cartridges: black, cyan, 
magenta, and yellow. Some models designed 
for photo printing have even more cartridges 
for greater photo realism, and may also have 
a memory card slot so you can print photos 
directly from the card rather than having to go 
through a computer.
Inkjet printers are popular in homes and small 
businesses because the cost of the printer is 
very low, so it’s economical to get started. 
However, the ink cartridges are expensive and 
don’t last for very many pages, so high-volume 
printing on an inkjet printer can be very expen-
sive. The special glossy paper needed for best-
quality photo printing can also be expensive.

Figure 3.24  An inkjet printer.
CAUTION
If an inkjet printer sits idle for weeks at a time, the ink in the nozzles dries out, and you may see quality 
problems with your printouts. Running the printer’s self-cleaning cycle may restore the print quality, but doing 
so wastes some ink, driving up the cost per page even higher. Unfortunately there is not much you can do to 
prevent this; it’s just something to be aware of when selecting a printer technology.

86
Part I: Computer Basics and Hardware
Laser Printers
Laser printers are popular in business because they are fast, they handle 
high-volume printing well, and the cost per page is low. They also pro-
duce good quality, high-resolution output, and both color and black-
and-white models are available. The main drawback is the initial cost, 
which can be higher than for other printer types. Figure 3.25 shows a 
laser printer.

Figure 3.25  A laser printer.
A laser printer prints by creating an image of the page on a rotating 
drum using varying levels of electrical charges. The drum is negatively 
charged and then a laser neutralizes the charge in some spots. When the 
drum rotates past a reservoir of toner (a powdered mixture of colored 
plastic particles and iron), the toner is attracted to the neutralized areas 
and clings to the drum. Then the paper rotates past positively charged 
paper, and the toner is pulled off the drum and onto the paper. A fuser 
element heats the paper, melting the plastic particles in the toner so that 
the particles stick to the paper permanently.

Specialty Printers
In addition to the printer types discussed so far, a variety of special-
purpose printers exist. You may see some of these printers in businesses, 
schools, and government offices.
Thermal printers transfer images to paper using heat. For example, 
some cash registers use a special thermal-coated paper for receipts; the 
cash register contains a simple direct thermal printer that heats cer-
tain areas of the paper so that it turns black and forms the text for your 
receipt. A thermal wax transfer printer melts a wax-based ink onto 
paper in tiny dots, using dithering to create different colors. It’s a high-
cost, medium-quality printout that was popular before color laser print-
ers became economically feasible for ordinary users, but is seldom seen 
today. A thermal dye transfer printer, sometimes called a dye sublima-
tion printer, heats ribbons containing dye and then diffuses the dye into 
specially coated paper. The print quality is outstanding, but the paper 
and the dye are both expensive. Some small-format snapshot printers use 
this technology.
A plotter is a large-format printer that excels at creating high-precision 
drawings like blueprints, maps, and engineering drawings. Figure 3.26 
shows a plotter. Plotters are available that use a variety of printing tech-
nologies, including variants of inkjet and laser. On the other end of the 
size spectrum, some small-format specialty printers work with their own 
software to accomplish specific tasks, such as printing labels, postage, or 
work orders.

Part I: Computer Basics and Hardware
Speaker systems designed for computers are somewhat different from 
speaker systems designed for home stereo and home theater systems. 
Typically, a single 3.5mm plug connects to an output port on the com-
puter; you don’t plug in the speakers separately to the computer. On a 
two-speaker system, one speaker connects to the computer and the other 
speaker connects to the first speaker. A system with more speakers than 
that usually has a central gathering point, such as a subwoofer into which 
all the speakers connect.
Step by Step
Adjusting Sound Output Volume in Windows
Window 7 provides a Volume control in the notification area that you can easily use to 
adjust the overall sound coming from your computer’s speakers or headphone, and also 
mute or unmute the sound. You can also adjust the volume levels for individual compo-
nents. Follow these steps to explore your computer’s sound controls:
	 1.	In the notification area, click the speaker icon. A slider appears.
	 2.	Click the speaker graphic at the bottom of the slider. A red X appears on the button, 
indicating the sound is muted.
	 3.	Click the Mixer hyperlink at the bottom of the slider. A dialog box opens showing 
individual sliders for each adjustable sound-producing item on your system. You may 
have different ones than shown here.
	 4.	Adjust any of the sliders as needed, and then close the dialog box.
Another difference in computer speaker systems is that the speakers have 
magnetic shielding to protect nearby computer devices from electromag-
netic interference (EMI). Most speakers are powered speakers, mean-
ing they require an AC adapter or batteries to function. The power boosts 
the amplification of the sound, and is necessary because most computers 
don’t have a built-in amplifier the way most home stereo systems do.
Depending on the computer, there may be a separate headphone jack, or 
you may need to unplug the speakers to plug in a headphone set.

Distortion of electrical signals through a cable by 
a nearby magnetic field.
powered speakers Speakers that contain their 
own amplification, powered by either AC current

Audio can also be output to a portable digital media player such as an iPod or iPhone, but that type of output 
is not the same as sending the audio to a speaker system. When you output music to a digital player, you are 
transferring files to the player, so the process is much more like copying files to an external drive than it is 
setting up sound output. The next section of this chapter discusses file storage and transfer.

Choosing Appropriate Storage Devices
As you learned in Chapter 2, “The System Unit,” when a computer pro-
cesses data, RAM (Random Access Memory) holds that data temporarily. 
RAM is known as primary storage because it’s where the data must be 
in order to interact with the CPU. Data waits for the CPU’s attention in 
memory, and then it waits again in memory when the CPU has finished 
processing it.
For data to be safely and permanently stored, however, it must be placed 
in secondary storage. Secondary storage devices are nonvolatile, so 
they don’t lose their contents when the computer’s power is turned off. 
Secondary storage can include hard disk drives, solid state drives, CDs, 
DVDs, and network and cloud-based storage.
Storage devices are evaluated in these ways:
◾	 Capacity: How much can it hold?
◾	 Cost: How much does the storage cost per megabyte or gigabyte?
◾	 Access speed: How quickly can the data be written and retrieved?
◾	 Interface: How does it connect to the computer, and how fast is 
that connection?
◾	 Media type: Is it magnetic, optical, or solid-state?
◾	 Portability: Is the storage inside the system unit, or connected to it 
externally?
◾	 Removability: Is the disc removable from the drive that reads and 
writes it, or are they one inseparable unit?
Table 3.5 at the end of this section compares the different types of stor-
age devices along these factors.
In the following sections, you will learn about storage in general, and 
about several types of storage devices and their characteristics.
primary storage System RAM in a computer, 
where processed data is first stored after it exits 
the CPU.
secondary storage Storage that retains data 
after the computer is turned off, such as a hard 
disk drive, DVD, or USB flash drive.

Data Storage Basics
A file is a named collection of bits that work together to represent a single 
object, such as an executable program, a spreadsheet, a picture, or a system 
file. Folders are logical organizing units for files. For example, a Windows-
based computer has a Windows folder containing the system files needed 
to run Windows, a Users folder containing the data files and settings for 
each user account, and a Program Files folder containing the files needed 
for each installed application. A folder within a folder is called a subfolder; 
each of the aforementioned folders contains multiple subfolders. Files and 
folders are stored on volumes. Each volume has a letter followed by a 
colon, such as C: or D:. Figure 3.27 summarizes this structure.
Figure 3.27  Files are stored in folders, which are stored on volumes.
Some people use the terms disk (or disc), drive, and volume interchange-
ably, but they have different meanings. The term disk refers to a platter 
or set of platters on which data is stored. Examples include a hard disk 
drive (HDD) and a DVD. When referring to a CD, DVD, or Blu-ray, it is 
customary to spell the term disc. The term drive refers to the mechanical 
components that read and write the data on a disk. In some cases, such as 
with an HDD, the drive and its platters are physically inseparable, so the 
terms disk and drive have come to be synonymous; hard disk and hard 
drive refer to the same thing. When the disc is removable from the drive, 
however, as with a CD or DVD, the terms are separate. See Figure 3.28.
Solid-state storage devices such as USB flash drives are technically neither 
discs nor drives, because they have no platters and no moving parts. 
However, they are commonly referred to as drives anyway, as in the term 
solid-state drive (SSD).
Most commonly, each physical storage device acts as a single volume. For 
example, your DVD drive might have a volume letter of E: assigned to 
it. However, some high-capacity storage devices such as hard disk drives 
can be partitioned into multiple volumes, each of which appears in the 
operating system to be a separate storage device with its own letter.
file A group of related bits stored together under 
a single name.
folder A logical organizing unit for grouping 
related files together.
subfolder A folder within another folder.
volume A physical storage device, or a portion 
of one, that is assigned an identifying letter. 
Sometimes used interchangeably with drive, but 
a physical drive may actually contain multiple 
volumes.
disk One or more platters on which data is 
stored. Spelled disc when referring to the optical 
type (DVDs, CDs).
drive The mechanical components that read and 
write the data on a disk.

Chapter 3: Input, Output, and Storage
Figure 3.28  In hard disk drives, the disk and drive are one unit; in optical drives, the disc 
and drive are separate.
Hard Disk Drives
A hard disk drive (HDD) is the most popular type of secondary stor-
age for personal computers. Although newer technologies are emerging, 
HDDs remain the standard because of their high capacity and low cost.
An HDD consists of a stack of metal platters (usually 4 to 6) that are coated 
with iron dust. These platters spin on a common spindle inside a sealed 
metal casing. A set of read/write heads inside the HDD casing reads and 
writes data on the platters; there are heads on each side of each platter. The 
arms move in and out to reach different spots on the platters, and the disks 
move past the heads as they spin. The most common platter sizes are 3.5” 
in diameter on HDDs for desktop systems and 2.5” on HDDs for note-
books. Figure 3.29 shows the inside of a hard disk drive case.
The data is stored on the platters in patterns of magnetic polarity. The iron 
dust on the surface is very sensitive to magnetic polarity and can be easily 
magnetized. As the disk surface moves past a read/write head, the write 
head switches its polarity between positive and negative to change the 
polarity on the surface, creating a pattern of polarity changes. Each polar-
ity change represents a 1 bit, and each area where there could have been a 
polarity change but there isn’t one represents a 0 bit. An HDD has an inter-
nal controller that manages the physical reading and writing operations.

that reads and writes to the disk(s).

92
Part I: Computer Basics and Hardware
A precise system exists for describing the physical locations on an HDD. 
The platters are divided into concentric circles, like the rings on a tree 
trunk cross-section, called tracks. Each platter’s first track is track 0, the 
next one track 1, and so on. The track number tells the drive where to 
position the actuator arm that controls the position of the read/write 
heads. All the heads move together, so if one head is reading track 1 on 
one side of one platter, all the other heads are also reading track 1 on 
their side of their platter too. For this reason, tracks are not referred to 
individually, but as cylinders. A cylinder is the group of all the tracks at a 
single arm position. Figure 3.30 illustrates the relationship between these 
parts.
Figure 3.30  A hard disk drive is organized into tracks, cylinders, heads, and sectors.
Each track is divided into segments called sectors. A sector holds exactly 
512 bytes. Because there are so many sectors, and because almost every 
file is much larger than 512 bytes, sectors are grouped together into 
­clusters, and the drive’s controller addresses clusters rather than individ-
ual sectors. The number of sectors per cluster is determined by the drive’s 
size and formatting, but most modern HDDs have 32 sectors per cluster.
An HDD can be internal or external, but most are internal, installed 
inside the system unit. An internal HDD connects to the motherboard 
using either a parallel ATA (PATA) or serial ATA (SATA) cable. An 
external HDD connects to a port on the outside of the system unit, and 
depending on the model may use a USB port, a FireWire (IEEE 1394a) 
port, or an external SATA (eSATA) port. You can buy enclosures that 
will convert an internal HDD to an external one.
See “Drive Connectors” in Chapter 2, “The System Unit,” for more 
information about PATA and SATA. See the section “Other Common 
External Connectors” in Chapter 2 to learn more about USB and 
FireWire.

Chapter 3: Input, Output, and Storage
Optical Drives
An optical drive uses a light beam and sensor to read the data. The 
surface of a blank optical disc is shiny and reflects light strongly. When 
data is written to an optical disc, certain areas are burned with a laser so 
they are less reflective. The shiny areas are called land, and the less-shiny 
areas are called pits. Recall from the preceding section that on an HDD, 
transitions between positive and negative magnetic polarity indicate a 
1 bit, and lack of transition indicates a 0 bit. On an optical disc, transi-
tions between areas of greater and lesser reflectivity indicate a 1, and a 
consistent level of reflectivity indicates a 0. See Figure 3.31.
Figure 3.31  Magnetic and optical storage both look for transitions in the state of the 
disc surface.
There are several types of optical drives and discs. The oldest and most 
basic type is a compact disc (CD), which holds up to 900MB of data. 
CDs are used for small amounts of data and also for audio recordings. 
A digital versatile disc (DVD) can store up to 4.7GB per disc (single-
sided, single layer). DVDs can also be double-sided, with recordings 
on both sides rather than recording on one and a label on the other. 
DVDs can also be dual-layer, where the top layer is semitransparent and 
read using a laser and sensor at a different angle than the lower layer. A 
double-sided, dual-layer DVD can hold up to 17GB of data. DVDs are 
used to distribute large applications, large amounts of data, and standard-
definition movies. Blu-ray discs (BD) can store up to 128GB in up to 
four layers. They are used to distribute even larger amounts of data, or 
high-definition movies.
All three types of discs can be read-only (ROM), recordable once (R), or 
rewriteable (RW). To record or rewrite a disc, you must have a drive with 
that capability that supports the type of disc you are using.
DVDs come in two competing recordable and rewriteable standards, 
abbreviated as plus and minus signs, like this: DVD+R and DVD-R. Some 
older home stereo systems do not support reading from +R and +RW 
discs, but otherwise the differences are unnoticeable to most consumers.
Table 3.4 lists the types of blank optical discs you can buy and their 
capacities.

stored in patterns of greater and lesser reflectivity, 
such as a DVD or CD.

CAUTION
Optical discs are sturdy, but scratches, dirt, and fingerprints can prevent them from being read accurately. 
Store discs in a protective sleeve or case when you are not using them, and hold discs only by their edges. 
Don’t let anything touch the shiny side of the disc, especially anything sharp or abrasive. If you need to write 
on a disc, write only on the label side, and use only a suitable soft marking pen.
Solid-State Drives
A solid-state drive (SSD) uses a type of EEPROM to store data in tiny 
transistors. As you learned in Chapter 2, electrically erasable program-
mable read-only memory (EEPROM) is a type of memory that stores its 
contents permanently; it is nonvolatile. Because it is electrically erasable, 
the computer can erase what’s written there and rewrite it. The type of 
EEPROM used in solid-state drives can be erased and rewritten in small 
blocks, making it suitable for use as a storage device.
When a solid-state drive is a large-capacity replacement for an HDD, 
it’s sometimes called a solid-state hard drive (SSHD) to distinguish it 
from lower-capacity portable solid-state storage such as USB flash drives. 
Figure 3.32 shows a solid-state hard drive.

solid state storage device that substitutes for an 
HDD as the main storage drive in a computer.

Figure 3.32  A solid-state hard drive looks much like an HDD from the outside.
Solid-state drives are silent because they don’t have any moving parts, 
and the access time is very fast because there are no read/write heads that 
have to move anywhere to get to the data. SSDs are more expensive than 
HDDs, though; you get much less capacity for the money. For this reason, 
SSHDs are found mostly in high-end desktop and notebook computers. 
Solid-state storage is common in tablets and smartphones, where high-
capacity storage is not needed and being lightweight is a primary concern.
To balance between performance and cost, some systems have both a 
small SSD and a larger HDD. The SSD contains the start-up files and the 
operating system, and the HDD holds everything else. Hybrid drives are 
also available that combine the two technologies in a single physical unit.

Network Volumes
As you’ve seen so far in this chapter, most computer storage is directly 
attached to the individual computer. This is known as local storage, or 
direct-attached storage (DAS). However, computers can also use a 
network to access storage that’s not physically nearby.
Network storage can enable multiple users to access the same up-to-the-
minute information simultaneously. For example, in a retail business with 
multiple checkout areas, all the checkout computers access a common 
database containing the item prices so that when the price of an item 
changes, all cashiers immediately have that information available. On a 
smaller scale, a family could store its movie and music collection on one 
computer, which then can share the collection with all the other com-
puters in the household via the family’s wireless network. Storage that is 
available via a network is called network-attached storage (NAS).
Generically speaking, network-attached storage can be a volume on a file 
server in a business network or a shared folder on an individual’s personal 
computer. However, the term is most often applied to a NAS appliance, 
which is a specialized computing device built specifically for network file 
sharing. The appliance connects directly into the network and can be 
remotely configured from any computer, so it doesn’t need its own input 
or output devices. NAS appliances are available for consumers as well as 
businesses; for example, you could connect an inexpensive NAS appliance 
to your home network to provide everyone in your family with always-on 
access to shared files.
Some large companies employ storage-area networks (SANs) to make 
central access to large amounts of data simple. A SAN logically combines 
the contents of multiple remote storage devices so that each individual com-
puter connected to the SAN sees that storage pool as a single local drive.
When it is essential that data be kept safe and readily available, some 
companies store that data on a redundant array of inexpensive disks 
(RAID). There are several types of RAID systems, and each type offers 
improvements over a single disk drive in performance, in data safety, or 
in both. Usually, when you store data on a disk, you write to one disk at 
a time. RAID systems have the ability to spread the data across multiple 
drives so each physical disk contains part of the data; this is called strip-
ing. For example, RAID0 stripes data across multiple physical disks to 
improve the speed at which data is accessed, and RAID1 mirrors the con-
tents of a physical disk on another identical disk so that the data is always 
available even if the original disk fails. RAID5 combines the striping from 
RAID0 with a data storage method that enables the RAID unit to recon-
struct lost data on any of the physical disks in the event of a disk failure.
Cloud-Based Storage
A cloud is a secure computing environment consisting of a set of remote 
servers that users access via the Internet. A cloud can include applications, 
communication with other users, and storage space (cloud storage).
One of the most popular individual cloud storage systems is Microsoft 
OneDrive. If you have a Microsoft account (which is free), you automati-
cally get several gigabytes of OneDrive storage online. It is a secure storage

environment, and you can optionally choose to share certain folders or files 
with specific other people or with the public. Google also offers free cloud-
based storage to users, as do many other online companies.
Businesses of all sizes also employ cloud storage. For example, a busi-
ness with many locations might create a cloud-based information system 
for all employees to access, regardless of where they are. This informa-
tion system might include customer and product information, order 
information, access to human resources data such as vacation schedules, 
and company-wide announcements and memos. A large company might 
maintain its own online server for implementing its cloud environment, 
or might contract with a third-party company to host its cloud.

Summary
Selecting and Using Input Devices
Input devices allow the user to communicate with the computer. The most common input 
devices are a keyboard and mouse, both of which can be either wired or wireless. A keyboard can 
have an ergonomic design to prevent hand and wrist strain. Devices that lack a real keyboard use a 
virtual keyboard (software-based) to enable user input.
A pointing device controls the onscreen pointer in the user interface. A mouse can be mechanical 
or optical. Other pointing devices include trackball and touchpad. Some computers have a touch 
screen on which your finger can serve as a pointing device. A drawing tablet enables you to input 
drawings using a stylus.
A scanner digitizes a hard-copy photo using a charge-coupled device (CCD). A scanner can be part of 
a multi-function device (MFD) that also includes a printer and copier. A bar code reader is a special-
ized type of scanner used for reading Universal Product Code (UPC) symbols. Magnetic bar code 
readers and radio frequency identification (RFID) chips are other types of scanning devices, as are 
optical mark recognition (OMR) systems and magnetic-ink character recognition (MICR) systems.
A capture device captures new content, rather than scanning existing content. Examples include 
digital cameras and digital video cameras. A webcam is a digital video camera that must remain 
connected to a computer in order to function.
Audio input can be used to control a computer with commands and to input music and sounds. 
Audio input requires an audio adapter (sound card). When using a microphone for audio input, 
voice-recognition software interprets speech by matching words in a database; speech recogni-
tion software is teachable software that learns an individual’s pronunciation.
Selecting and Using Output Devices
A display screen is a video screen the computer uses for outputting information to the user. A 
stand-alone display screen is called a monitor. Liquid crystal display (LCD) is a popular type 
of flat-screen monitor technology. A newer alternative is organic light-emitting diode (OLED). 
An LCD screen can be either active matrix (a version of which is thin-film transistor) or passive 
matrix. In active matrix, each pixel has its own transistor. A high-definition TV (HDTV) can 
also be used as a computer monitor via a high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI).
Cathode ray tube (CRT) is an older monitor technology that uses a vacuum tube and electron guns to 
light up colored phosphors on a glass screen. Phosphors are arranged in triads of red, green, and blue.
Some specialized display types include e-paper (for book readers), digital whiteboards, and digi-
tal projectors. Projector brightness is measured in lumens.
A display screen has a maximum resolution, expressed as a number of pixels horizontally and 
vertically. The ratio of horizontal to vertical is its aspect ratio. The refresh rate is the number of 
times per second the display is refreshed. The number of bits needed to describe the color of a 
pixel is the color depth. A display adapter tells the display screen what to do.
The key factors in selecting a printer include initial cost, cost per page for consumables, print 
resolution (expressed in dots per inch), speed, color, interface, and paper handling. Printers can 
be impact (dot matrix printer) or non-impact (almost all other printer types), depending on 
whether or not they strike the page to make the image.
A dot matrix printer uses pins to strike an inked ribbon. They are inexpensive to operate and 
can print multi-part forms, but do not handle graphics well. An ink jet printer squirts liquid ink 

101

onto paper. The printer is inexpensive to buy and produces good quality color graphics, but the 
cost per page is high because of the cost of the ink cartridges. A laser printer transfers toner to 
a drum and then to paper, and then fuses the toner to the paper. It is economical per page and 
produces good quality output, but is expensive to buy initially. Specialty printers include direct 
thermal, thermal wax transfer, thermal dye transfer, and plotters.
Audio output comes through speakers and headphones. Speakers designed for computer use are 
powered and have shielding to prevent electromagnetic interference (EMI).
Choosing Appropriate Storage Devices
Primary storage is RAM; secondary storage is permanent storage, such as a disk. Files are stored 
in folders or subfolders, on volumes. A disk is a platter (or multiple platters) that store data; a 
drive is the mechanical component that reads and writes the data. In some storage types, the disk 
and drive are inseparable.
A hard disk drive (HDD) is the most popular type of secondary storage for personal computers. 
It is magnetic and mechanical and usually internal to the system unit. Read/write heads magnetize 
different spots on the disk platters to store the data in sectors on tracks. A group of sectors is a 
cluster. A group of tracks at a specific read/write head position is a cylinder. HDDs can use either 
PATA or SATA connectors internally, or USB, FireWire, or eSATA externally.
An optical drive uses a light beam and sensor to read data on compact discs (CD), digital versa-
tile discs (DVD), and/or Blu-ray discs (BD).
A solid-state drive (SSD) uses EEPROM to store data in tiny transistors. Solid-state hard drives 
(SSHD) are a substitute for traditional HDDs as the main secondary storage in a computer.
Local drives are direct-attached storage (DAS). Network-accessible storage is network-attached stor-
age (NAS). NAS appliances are simple computers designed to be used as network storage. A storage-
area network (SAN) makes remote storage appear as a local volume on each individual computer.
A redundant array of inexpensive disks (RAID) is a system that uses multiple physical HDDs to 
increase performance and reliability by spreading the data out across all the disks and implement-
ing schemes for reconstructing the data in the event of one disk’s failure.
Cloud storage is storage that the user accesses online via a cloud, which is a secure computing 
environment online.
Troubleshooting Common Input,  
Output and Storage Problems
If a device isn’t working, check its connectors to make sure they are snug, and check to make sure 
the device is receiving power if it requires it.
If a keyboard key is stuck, shake the keyboard upside-down or use compressed air to blow debris out 
from under the keys. If a mouse doesn’t move the pointer in one direction, clean the sensors on it.
An amber light on the monitor means it is not getting a signal from the computer. Updating the 
display adapter’s driver can solve various problems with the display quality.
For printer quality problems, clean the printer (including ink jets), and make sure there is enough 
ink or toner installed correctly.
For sound problems, check the volume control in the operating system to make sure it is not 
muted, and make sure the audio adapter’s driver is installed correctly.

Input and Output Devices in Your World
For the next 24 hours, notice what computer input and output devices you see in use at school, at 
work, in your community, and at home. For example, at your local grocery store, you might see 
a digital cash register with a bar code scanner and a thermal receipt printer, and you might see a 
magnetic card reader for credit card processing. See how many devices from this chapter you can 
identify, and submit a list to your instructor of what you saw and where you saw it.
Speech Recognition in Windows 7
In Windows 7, turn on speech recognition. To do so, open the Control Panel and type speech in 
the search box. Next, click Windows Speech Recognition and work through the wizard to config-
ure the feature. Then start Speech Recognition by saying Start Listening.
Next, open Microsoft Word, start a new blank document, and speak the following text into your 
microphone:
I am learning to use a microphone as an input device in Windows 7. I am dictating this text 
aloud, and Microsoft Word is typing it for me. Speech recognition is part of Windows 7’s 
Ease of Access features.
When you are finished speaking, correct any errors. Then either save or discard the Word docu-
ment, as your instructor directs you to do.
Think It Over
How Much Does Printing Really Cost?
Suppose your employer needs to print about 3,000 invoices a month. He asks you to recommend 
a printer type and to prepare a cost estimate for the purchase of a printer. Weigh the options avail-
able, and do some Internet research to find suitable models and their prices. Research the cost of 
the consumables for the printers as well.
Prepare a report that summarizes the initial cost to buy the printer as well as the cost of consum-
ables. Check the printer’s documentation online to find out if there are any other parts that periodi-
cally need to be replaced (for example, the drum in a laser printer may need replacing at some point) 
and the number of pages the printer can produce before that replacement is necessary. Present the 
consumable cost per page, as well as an estimate of the monthly and yearly consumable cost.
Optional: Find a printer that has a lower cost per page than the printer you initially chose, and 
prepare the same report as before with the new cost data.

Solid-State Drives
Solid-state hard drives (SSHD) are more expensive than HDDs, as you learned in this chapter. 
Nevertheless, some businesses are adopting them as the main storage devices for new personal 
computers that the companies buy. What might be the reasoning behind this? Brainstorm a list of 
the benefits you get with an SSHD compared to an HDD.
Optional: Use the Internet to research what other consumers who have purchased solid-state hard 
drives have said.
Backing Up Your Files
Suppose you want to back up your entire MP3 and home video collection, which currently occu-
pies 100 GB on your computer’s main HDD. Would it be better to buy an external HDD to do 
the backup or to back the files up onto optical discs? Consider not only cost, but also convenience, 
reliability, and ease of retrieving the files later. If you chose optical discs, which type would you 
use, and how many of them would you need? If you chose an external HDD, what size would you 
buy—one that the files barely fit on, or one with room for more files you might acquire later?

When you think about using a computer, you probably think about performing 
some useful task with it, or playing a game. Behind the scenes, though, is the soft-
ware that keeps the computer running and responding to commands: the operat-
ing system (OS).
The operating system you use can make a big difference in how the computer 
behaves, how it respond to commands, what applications it can run, and what add-
on hardware you can attach. By understanding the available operating systems and 
their benefits, you can make the right choice in selecting an operating system—or 
you can choose to purchase a device with the right operating system already built in.
In this chapter, you will learn about system software in general, and how operating 
systems work. You’ll survey several popular operating systems and learn how they 
communicate with hardware, with the Internet, and with the user. You will also 
find out how computers store and manage files.

Programmer
A programmer writes the instructions that become 
computer programs. Whether it’s an operating system, a 
utility, or a game, a programmer takes a general concept 
like “open a dialog box with user controls for adjusting 
the graphics quality” and makes it a reality by writing the 
exact instructions needed, line by line. The programmer 
then compiles those instructions into a usable program 
or combines them with the instructions written by another 
programmer or group of programmers to make a larger 
program. More experienced programmers may also 
participate in developing the requirements for a program. 
A programmer should have at least an Associate Degree 
in Computer Technology, Computer Science, or Information 
Technology, and should be familiar with at least two or three 
different programming languages.
Understanding System Software
System software includes BIOS, the operating system, and utility 
programs that perform system maintenance and protection tasks such as 
error correction and backup. Let’s look at each category in more detail.
The System BIOS
As you learned in Chapter 2, “The System Unit,” the Basic Input/Output 
System (BIOS) is the built-in software on the motherboard that starts 
the computer. It performs a power-on self-test (POST) at start-up, which 
ensures that all the critical hardware devices are functioning properly, 
including the CPU, the RAM, and the motherboard. If the hardware passes 
the tests, the BIOS looks for an operating system on one of the available 
drives, and then passes off control to the operating system to complete the 
boot process. The BIOS has a list of default settings it uses for managing 
memory and devices, but those settings can be overridden by user settings 
that you specify. You can change those settings through a setup program, as 
you learned in Chapter 2 in the section “Error Message on a Black Screen.”
See the Step by Step exercise “Exploring Your CMOS Setup” in 
Chapter 2 to practice modifying BIOS settings.
The Operating System
The BIOS starts the computer at a basic level, but the operating system 
does the bulk of work to keep it running and to help the user accomplish 
tasks. Remember from Chapter 1, “Computer Basics,” that the operating 
system performs these important functions (see Figure 4.1):
◾	 It provides the user interface that humans use to communicate 
commands and receive feedback.
◾	 It communicates with the hardware, instructing it to take action to 
accomplish tasks. For example, it communicates with the keyboard 
and mouse to accept input, and it communicates with the display 
screen to show output.
system software Software that starts the 
computer and keeps it running, performing basic 
system tasks such as running applications, man-
aging files, and correcting errors.

◾	 It runs applications, and enables humans to interact with them.
◾	 It controls and manages the file storage system.
Figure 4.1  The functions performed by an operating system.
There are many kinds of operating systems, suited for a wide range of 
devices, from supercomputers to smartphones. Each operating system is 
optimized for the hardware it runs on and the tasks the user is likely to 
want to perform. For example, the operating system on a tablet com-
puter is designed to be compact (because there is limited storage space in 
the tablet), easy to operate (because most users are not computer profes-
sionals), and fast to respond to simple commands, whereas the operat-
ing system in a server is designed to give computer professionals many 
options for managing and configuring the server and supporting users 
and databases.
Some operating systems are designed to run on just one specific plat-
form. A platform is a type of hardware. For example, the type of 
hardware used in most Windows-based computers is called the Intel 
platform or the IBM-compatible platform. Those names originate from 
the makers of the early CPUs (Intel) and personal desktop computers 
(IBM). Several different operating systems run on the Intel platform, 
including Microsoft Windows, UNIX, and Linux. In addition, recent 
versions of the Mac OS X will also run on the Intel platform. Most 
tablets and smartphones, on the other hand, support only one operating 
system. For example, devices built on the Macintosh platform such as the 
Apple iPad and iPhone support only the Apple iOS operating system.
platform A type of computer hardware that is 
compatible with certain operating systems.
Intel platform A platform that was originally 
based on CPUs made by Intel. The Intel platform 
can run Windows, UNIX, Linux, and newer versions 
of Mac OS X operating systems.

112
Part II: Software
NOTE
The 32-bit Intel platform is sometimes called x86. That name is a nod to the old Intel line of CPUs where the 
model numbers all ended in 86, such as 286, 386, and 486. The 64-bit Intel platform is sometimes called 
x64. Windows 7 comes in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions, and when purchasing a copy of Windows, you must 
match the Windows version to the hardware platform you have.
x86 The 32-bit version of the Intel platform.
x64 The 64-bit version of the Intel platform.
An operating system can have either a graphical user interface (GUI) 
or a command-line interface. GUI interfaces are the norm in operating 
systems designed for most personal computing devices, such as desktops, 
notebooks, tablets, and smartphones. Users interact with the graph-
ics they see onscreen by using a keyboard or mouse, or using a finger 
or stylus on a touch screen. In a command-line interface, users employ 
a keyboard to type commands at a prompt; the interface is text-only. 
Command-line operating systems were common in the early days of 
computing, but nowadays they are confined mostly to server operating 
systems. Figure 4.2 compares a GUI to a command-line interface.
graphical user interface (GUI) A user inter-
face based on a graphical environment, in which 
users interact with it using a pointing device or 
touch screen as the primary input device.
command-line interface A user interface 
based on typing text at a command prompt.
Figure 4.2  A GUI (left) and a command-line interface (right).
An operating system can be single-user or multi-user. The operating 
systems on most personal devices are single-user. For example, only one 
person at a time typically uses a desktop PC with Windows installed. 
Server operating systems like UNIX, on the other hand, are designed to 
support multiple users accessing them simultaneously—for example, a 
dozen different cash registers in a retail store all simultaneously sending 
transactions to a central database.
Utility Software
Utility software performs a task (or set of tasks) that optimizes, repairs, 
or safeguards the computer or its data. The difference between utility 
software and the operating system is sometimes not clear-cut, because 
most operating systems come with many utility programs built-in. For 
utility software Software that performs some 
useful service to the operating system, such as 
optimizing or correcting the file storage system, 
backing up files, or ensuring security or privacy.

113
Chapter 4: Operating System Basics
example, Microsoft Windows comes with utilities for checking a disk 
for errors and optimizing the way files are stored on an HDD (hard disk 
drive). Third-party utility software is also available, and may do a more 
thorough job at the task, combine multiple functions in a single inter-
face, or have more advanced options for configuring how the tasks will 
run. Figure 4.3 shows the Norton Security Suite, which provides secu-
rity, identity protection, a backup utility, and a PC tune-up utility.
Figure 4.3  A third-party application such as Norton Security Suite provides several 
­different utilities.
There are many types of utilities that protect the computer from attack 
by malware (harmful or maliciously created software). Antivirus pro-
grams find and remove viruses, for example, anti-spyware software finds 
and removes spyware and adware, firewall software blocks hackers 
from invading your system, and anti-spam software detects and seg-
regates junk email. Some all-in-one protection suites such as Norton 
Security Suite protect against many types of threats at once. You will 
learn more about the different types of malware and their detection and 
removal in Chapter 16, “Network and Internet Privacy and Security.”
Other utilities detect problems with the computer’s operation. For 
example, a disk checking program can find and fix errors in the file 
system on a volume, and a registry cleanup program can find and fix 
inconsistent or unneeded entries in the registry, which is the system 
configuration database that Microsoft Windows uses. An uninstaller 
utility removes installed software along with any associated files and 
registry entries.
Backup software makes backup copies of your important files on a separate 
drive, for safekeeping. You can automate and schedule the backup process 
so it occurs without your intervention at whatever interval you specify.
malware Harmful or maliciously created soft-
ware, such as a virus or spyware.
virus A type of malware that attaches itself to an 
executable file and spreads to other files when the 
program is run.
spyware A type of malware that spies on the 
user’s activities and reports them back to the 
spyware’s developer.
adware A type of malware that pops up 
unwanted ads on the screen.
firewall software Software that blocks hackers 
from accessing a computer by closing unneces-
sary services and ports.
anti-spam software Software that rejects junk 
email messages.
disk checking program Software that finds 
and fixes errors in the disk storage system.
registry cleanup program Software that ana-
lyzes the Windows registry and deletes unneeded 
entries.

Comparing the Major 
Operating Systems
When you think about operating systems, you probably think first 
of Microsoft Windows, which is the operating system used on more 
than 90 percent of all desktop and notebook PCs. You will learn a lot 
about Microsoft Windows in upcoming chapters. However, there are 
many other operating systems designed for a variety of computers and 
computer-related devices.
Desktop and Notebook Operating Systems
There are two main hardware platforms for desktop and notebook com-
puters: Apple and Intel (IBM-compatible). The Apple Macintosh plat-
form supports only the Apple operating system: Mac OS X (pronounced 
Mac O-S-X, although the X technically is the Roman numeral 10). This 
operating system has an attractive GUI and is easy to understand and 
use. Apple assigns the versions of Mac OS X code names as well as ver-
sion numbers. The most recent version at this writing is called Mavericks 
(version 10.9). Figure 4.4 shows the Mavericks version of Mac OS X.
Mac OS X The graphical operating system 
designed for Apple’s desktop and notebook 
computers. Newer versions now run on the Intel 
platform.
Mavericks The code name for Mac OS X 10.9.
Figure 4.4  Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks).
The Macintosh platform has been popular with graphics professionals for 
decades, and much of the best page layout and graphics editing software 
was originally developed for the Mac. However, in recent years, similar 

115
Chapter 4: Operating System Basics
software has become available for both Windows and Mac, so there is 
no reason to choose a Mac based on software compatibility anymore. 
Although Mac hardware is not cross-compatible with Windows software, 
Mac software is cross-compatible with the Intel platform. The latest ver-
sion of Mac OS X will run on both Macintosh and Intel computers.
Most Intel-based systems use Microsoft Windows. Like Mac OS 
X, Windows also has an attractive GUI and is easy to learn and use. 
Windows has the advantage of being the most popular OS, and therefore 
the one that more applications are written to run on.
The most recent version at this writing is Windows 8.1, but Windows 7 
is still widely used worldwide, and is the version featured in this book. 
Chapter 5 (“Introduction to Windows 7”) and Chapter 6 (“Windows 7 
Administration and Maintenance”) cover Windows 7 in detail; you will 
learn there how to run programs, manage files, and change configuration 
settings. Figure 4.5 shows the Windows 7 user interface.
Figure 4.5  Windows 7.
Linux (pronounced LIN-ucks) is an operating system that looks and feels 
very similar to UNIX. It can run on a variety of platforms, including Intel-
based desktops and notebooks, servers, and handheld devices. (Android, a 
popular OS for smartphones and tablets, is a variant of Linux.)
Linux was developed by Linus Torvalds. The name Linux is a combina-
tion of the words Linus and UNIX. Linux is open-source, which means 
that Mr. Torvalds retains ownership of his original code, but it is free 
to the public to use in any way they see fit. Users are free to modify 
the code, improve it, and redistribute it. Developers are not allowed to 
charge money for the Linux kernel itself (the main part of the operat-
ing system), but they can charge money for distributions (distros for 
short), which are packaged collections of add-ons and utility programs 
for Linux. Some of the most popular distros include SUSE Linux, 
Ubuntu Linux, and Red Hat Linux.
Microsoft Windows The graphical Microsoft 
operating system designed for Intel-platform 
desktop and notebook computers.
Linux An open-source, cross-platform operating 
system that runs on desktops, notebooks, tablets, 
and smartphones.
distribution or distro, a packaged collection of 
an open-source kernel such as Linux along with 
helpful add-ons and utilities.

116
Part II: Software
Linux is, at its core, a command-line operating system, as is UNIX. 
However, nearly all the distros contain multiple shells—utilities that 
allows a user to interact with the operating system. Most distros have a 
GUI sitting on top of the shell. These are highly graphical, and as attrac-
tive and easy to use as Windows and Mac OS X. Figure 4.6 shows the 
Ubuntu Linux shell, for example. Although most Windows and Mac OS 
X applications will not run in Linux, plenty of free, open-source equiva-
lents for most software types are designed specifically for Linux, or have 
Linux versions.
Figure 4.6  The Ubuntu Linux GUI.
Some portable computers, such as netbooks, don’t require a powerful 
operating system like Windows for the simple tasks they are designed 
to perform, like checking email and surfing the web. On such comput-
ers, performance is better, and more storage space remains when a thin 
client operating system is used. A thin client is an operating system that 
is “thinner” (that is, smaller and more agile) than a regular desktop oper-
ating system. It doesn’t have a lot of utilities or features, but it has the 
right ones for the system on which it is installed.
shell The user interface for an operating system. 
Some operating systems, like Windows, do not 
separate the shell from the kernel; others, like 
Linux, give you a choice of shells.
thin client A computer with minimal hardware, 
designed for a specific task. For example, a thin 
web client is designed for using the Internet.
Put It to Work
Running More than One OS
If you want to run multiple operating systems on a single PC, one way is to set it up to multi-boot. Each time you 
start the computer, a menu appears asking which operating system you want to start up. Each operating system 
must be on a separate volume in order to multi-boot. Windows supports multi-booting; install the non-Windows 
OS first, and then when you install Windows, its Setup program will ask whether you want to set up multi-booting. 
The drawback to multi-booting is that each time you want to switch operating systems, you have to restart the 
computer.
Another way to experience multiple operating systems on the same PC is to use a virtualization program. 
Virtualization enables you to create an entire virtual machine inside an application, and install a different operat-
ing system on it. The main operating system of the PC is the host OS, and the one inside the virtual machine is 
the guest OS. You can easily switch back and forth between the host and guest operating systems. VMWare  
(www.vmware.com/products) is the most popular virtualization software; versions are available for individual 
PCs as well as for large-scale commercial use, such as running several server OS versions on the same server.

117
Chapter 4: Operating System Basics
One popular thin client operating system is Chrome OS. Chrome is the 
name of both an operating system and a web browser, both produced by 
Google. Chrome OS is a variant of Linux, and was developed through an 
open-source project called Chromium OS. This simple operating system 
comes preinstalled on some thin clients. It contains a simple file manager, 
the Google Chrome web browser, and a media player. It doesn’t run 
most applications designed for other operating systems. Figure 4.7 shows 
a Chrome OS screen.
Figure 4.7  Google Chrome OS.
Chrome OS A thin client operating system 
created by Google for small notebook computers 
(netbooks).
New Thin Client Operating Systems
Chrome OS is far from the only operating system for thin web clients. Several other open-source operating 
systems have recently been released, such as Haiku (www.haiku-os.org), openThinClient (openthinclient.
org), and ThinStation (www.thinstation.org) These operating systems require less powerful computers than 
Windows or Mac OS X because they are leaner and have fewer features. Using a thin client operating system on 
an older computer can make it perform better when doing activities like browsing the web or managing email. 
The downside of using a non-standard operating system is that few applications are available for it, so you may 
be limited to the applications that come with it (usually a text editor, a web browser, an email program, and a 
music player, at the minimum).
New Technologies
Operating Systems for Servers
Servers are computers that share resources so they are available over a 
network for multiple users to access. For example, a network might have 
a mail server that handles the company’s internal email delivery, and a file 
server for storing and sharing files that everyone needs 24/7 access to. A 
company might also have a web server that makes the company’s website 
available to the public on the Internet.
server A computer that is dedicated to perform-
ing network tasks such as managing files, printers, 
or email for multiple users.

Part II: Software
Most servers use the Intel hardware platform (although some very large 
computers have proprietary operating systems, such as IBM’s z-OS, on 
their mainframes instead). The three most popular server operating sys-
tems are UNIX, Windows Server, and Linux.
You learned about Linux in the preceding section; it’s a very flexible 
open-source OS that can be used in many ways. Just as there are Linux 
distributions that include utilities and shells suitable for desktop use, 
there are also distros that package Linux for use as a server.
UNIX (pronounced YOU-nix) is an older operating system, first devel-
oped in the 1970s for servers, and still popular today for that purpose. 
It’s a command-line operating system, as you can see in Figure 4.8. 
Graphical shells are available, but server administrators often find it easier 
to work at the command prompt to accomplish the tasks they need to 
do. UNIX, like Linux, is cross-platform, so it runs on many different 
types of computer hardware.
UNIX A multi-user, command-line operating 
system for servers.
Figure 4.8  UNIX is a command-line operating system.
Windows Server is a version of Microsoft Windows that is optimized for 
use on servers. Its GUI is similar to that of the client version of Windows 
(that is, the version designed for individual PCs), but it has different fea-
tures and utilities designed to help IT professionals control server activi-
ties. Windows Server versions don’t match the client versions; they are 
released on a different schedule. The current version of Windows Server 
at this writing is 2012 R2, which resembles Windows 8.1, as shown in 
Figure 4.9.

Operating Systems for Tablets 
and Smartphones
Tablets and smartphones have special operating system needs. They use 
solid state storage, which is expensive, so the amount of storage space is 
limited. Therefore, a large operating system is impractical; the operating 
system must be simple, easy to use, and above all, compact in size. The 
operating system comes preinstalled on a static memory chip on tablets 
and smartphones, so these platforms are often referred to as system-on-
chip (SoC). A separate memory chip (or set of chips) is used to hold the 
data you create and the extra applications you install.
For most of their capabilities, tablet and phone operating systems rely on 
third-party applications (apps) purchased or downloaded for free from 
an online store. Because users can freely select their own apps, there is no 
need to provide lots of preinstalled apps with the operating system, and 
each person’s device can be customized for his or her preferred activities.
Portable Apple devices (iPhone and iPad) use an operating system called 
iOS. Its main advantage is its popularity—because it is so popular, thou-
sands of apps are available for it via the Apple Store. Figure 4.10 shows 
an iPad screen with iOS as the operating system.
The main competitor to iOS is Android, an open-source OS created by 
Google. Android is popular on low-end tablets because it is free, and 
because many apps are available for it and most of them are free. Many 
smartphones also use a version of Android.

Chapter 4: Operating System Basics
Understanding Device Drivers
As you learned earlier in the chapter, one of the operating system’s jobs 
is to communicate with the hardware. The problem with that, though, is 
that each piece of hardware speaks a different language, and they are all 
different from the language the operating system speaks. Device drivers 
help them communicate. Device drivers are files that translate the oper-
ating system’s requests into the language of a particular device, and then 
translate back again when the device sends a message in return. Each 
device driver is designed for one specific device and one specific operat-
ing system, although it may work, fully or partially, with other similar 
devices or operating systems.
A device driver can be essential to a device’s performance, and often 
when a device appears to be malfunctioning, it is really the driver’s fault. 
For example, if you are playing a game and there are big white patches 
on the display in certain parts of the game, the display adapter’s driver is 
probably at fault. It might be corrupted, but more likely it is just out-
of-date or incompatible with the game. Downloading and installing an 
update for that driver might correct the problem.
Different operating systems have different means of keeping drivers up to 
date. In Mac OS X, for example, driver updates are downloaded auto-
matically along with OS updates. In Windows 7, you can view driver ver-
sions and install new drivers via the Device Manager utility. You can also 
roll back an updated driver to the previous version if system problems 
occur after you install an update.
When you install a new piece of hardware, Windows uses a technol-
ogy called Plug and Play to identify the device and locate a driver for 
it if possible. Thanks to Plug and Play, users can set up most devices by 
simply connecting them, and perhaps running a software utility on a CD 
that comes with the device.
device driver A file that translates instructions 
and messages between the operating system and 
a hardware device.
Device Manager A Windows utility that 
provides detailed information about the hardware 
devices installed on the PC.

Step by Step
Opening Device Manager in Windows 7
In preparation for working with device drivers in Windows 7, you must open the Device Manager utility. Follow these 
steps to do so.
	 1.	Click Start and then click Control Panel.
	 2.	Click Hardware and Sound.
	 3.	Under the Devices and Printers heading, click Device Manager.
Note: On Windows 7 Enterprise version, the Device Manager entry appears on the Control Panel menu.

122
Part II: Software
Checking a Device Driver Version
If you are not sure if you have the latest version of a driver, 
check the driver version number and date, and compare it to 
the version available for download online.
	 1.	In Device Manager, double-click the category of device to 
expand the category.
	 2.	Double-click the device for which you want to check the 
driver version.
	 3.	Click the Driver tab, and examine the driver date and ver-
sion information that appears.
	 4.	Click OK to close the dialog box when you are finished.
Note: Some device manufacturers do not update device drivers 
frequently for older operating systems, so even if your current 
device driver is a few years old, it may still be the most recent 
version available for Windows 7.
Updating a Device Driver
Follow these steps to update a driver:
	 1.	In Device Manager, double-click the category of device to expand the category if it is not already expanded.
	 2.	Double-click the device for which you want to update the driver.
	 3.	Click the Driver tab and then click Update Driver.
	 4.	Click Search Automatically for Updated Driver Software. The utility checks the Internet for an available update. If a 
driver is found, it is automatically downloaded and installed.
	
	 OR
	
	 If you have already downloaded an updated driver but haven’t installed it yet, click Browse My Computer for Driver 
Software, and follow the prompts to locate and install it.

Rolling Back a Device Driver
If problems occur with your computer after you update a driver, follow these steps to return to the previous driver 
version:
	 1.	In Device Manager, double-click the category of device to expand the 
category if it is not already expanded.
	 2.	Double-click the device for which you want to roll back the driver.
	 3.	Click the Driver tab and then click Roll Back Driver.

	 2.	 What Windows utility is used to manage device drivers?
	 3.	 What does Plug and Play do?
What If There’s a Device Problem?
In Device Manager, you might occasionally see a yellow circle with an exclamation point in it superimposed on 
one of the device’s icons, indicating there is a problem with the device. Usually the problem is that a usable 
driver has not yet been installed. Download a driver from the device manufacturer’s website and install it (most 
come with a Setup program) to solve the problem. Another similar problem is that a device appears with a ques-
tion mark icon and appears in an Other Devices category. Installing a driver for the device will also correct that 
problem too.
Troubleshooting
Understanding Digital Storage
Most operating systems save and store files using the same basic prin-
ciples, although the individual file formats may differ between platforms 
and operating systems. The following sections describe the logical orga-
nization of computer file systems.
Drives, Volumes, and File Systems
A drive is a physical storage unit, such as an HDD, a SSD, or a DVD 
drive. As you learned in Chapter 3, “Input, Output, and Storage,” some 
drives are separate from their discs, as a DVD drive is. Other drives have 
the discs built-in, like in an HDD. And some drives are not technically 
“drives” at all, in that they have no moving parts, but are called drives for 
consistency; solid-state drives are an example of that. The term hard drive 
generically refers to both HDD and SSHD storage in popular usage.

124
Part II: Software
Each drive has one or more volumes, which are logical divisions of stor-
age areas. Volumes are represented by letters, such as C:. A small-capacity, 
removable storage device like a DVD or a USB flash drive has a single 
volume letter. A large-capacity storage device like an HDD or SSHD may 
be divided into multiple volumes.
To prepare a hard drive for use, it must first be partitioned. Partitioning 
creates the logical divisions of the available space. A physical drive can 
logically be a single volume (one big partition with one volume letter 
assigned), or it can be split up into many pieces, each with its own vol-
ume letter. Each volume must then be formatted. Formatting organizes 
the available space by creating a file system on it. The file system deter-
mines how the files will be stored and retrieved logically.
Depending on the operating system and the utility you are using to parti-
tion and format the drive, different file systems may be available. Modern 
versions of Windows prefer the New Technology File System (NTFS) 
for the system volume (that is, the volume on which Windows itself 
is installed), but can also support FAT32, a file system used in earlier 
Windows versions. Mac OS X uses a file system called Hierarchical File 
System Plus (HFS+). Linux supports several different file systems, and 
the default file system installed depends on the distro. CDs and DVDs 
commonly use the ISO 9660 (also called CD File System, or CDFS) or 
the Universal Disc Format (UDF) file system. Table 4.1 outlines the 
most popular file systems.
Different file systems offer different features and benefits. NTFS, for 
example, provides features like file encryption, file compression, support 
for long filenames (up to 255 characters), and support for large-capacity 
volumes (up to16 TB). You will learn about file encryption and compres-
sion later in this chapter.

Step by Step
Examining the Partitions and Volumes in Windows 7
Follow these steps to use the Disk Management tool to find out about your system’s drives and their partitions and 
volumes: 
	 1.	Click Start and then click Control Panel.
	 2.	Click System and Security.
	 3.	Under Administrative Tools, click Create and Format Hard Disk Partitions. The Disk Management window opens.
	 4.	Look in the lower section of the window. Each physical drive is listed here. In the example shown, Disk 0 is the 
physical HDD and CD-ROM 0 is the DVD drive, which is currently assigned the letter D: and has a disc in it that 
uses the UDF file system.
	 5.	Note the divisions next to each drive letter. In the example shown, Disk 0 has three partitions:
◾	 The first one contains 39 MB and is unlabeled. It is a reserved area created by the computer’s manufacturer.
◾	 The second one is named RECOVERY and contains 14.65 GB of space. It uses the NTFS file system. It has no 
drive letter assignment, so it will not show up in the operating system. It is used in conjunction with a recovery 
utility in the event that the operating system has to be repaired.
◾	 The third one is named OS and contains 451.07 GB of space and uses the NTFS. It has the letter C: assigned 
to it.
	 6.	Look in the upper section of the window. Each volume is separately listed, along with the file system, the status, 
the capacity, and the free space.
	 7.	Open the File menu and click Exit.

Part II: Software
How Files Are Organized in Folders
The top level of storage for a volume is its root directory. The root 
directory is like the lobby of a building. All other locations within the 
volume are accessed by going through it. The term root directory is a car-
ryover from an earlier time when folders were called directories. Another 
name for the root directory is top-level folder.
A file’s path is the complete descriptor of its location. A file named 
Budget.txt located in the root directory of the E: drive, for example, 
would have a path like this:
E:\Budget.txt
The colon (:) in the preceding example path indicates that the letter 
preceding it is a volume letter. The \ follows a folder (directory) name. 
The example has no name before the \ because the root directory has no 
name.
Now suppose that file were in a folder called Personal. Its path would 
look like this:
E:\Personal\Budget.txt
As you learned in Chapter 3, a folder within a folder is called a subfolder. 
Suppose that the Personal folder had a subfolder called Financial, and 
our example file was in that folder. The path would look like this:
E:\Personal\Financial\Budget.txt
A volume’s folder hierarchy can be complicated. There can be hundreds 
of folders in the root directory, and each of them can contain many 
levels of subfolders. A file management utility, such as Windows Explorer 
in Windows 7, provides a visual picture of the structure that you can 
browse. For example, in Figure 4.12, the example file appears in the 
Financial folder. The folder tree in the navigation pane at the left shows 
the complete path taken to get to that file.
In Windows 7, you can jump directly to any location by clicking its name 
in the navigation pane. You can expand and collapse folders there by 
double-clicking their names. You can also navigate by using the path that 
appears in the Address bar at the top of the Windows Explorer window. 
In Figure 4.12, the path appears like this:
Removable Disk (E:) ▸ Personal ▸ Financial
That’s simply an alternative way of writing the path. If you click in the 
Address bar, you see the traditional version of the path instead, like this:
E:\Personal\Financial
root directory The top level folder on a storage 
volume.
path The complete descriptor of a file’s location, 
including the volume and folders.
folder tree A graphical representation of a 
volume’s storage hierarchy, with subordinate 
branches for folders and subfolders.

Examining the Folder Structure in Windows 7
Follow these steps to use the Windows Explorer tool to browse the contents of the volumes folders on your computer:
	 1.	Click Start and then click Computer. Windows Explorer opens, showing all the volumes that it recognizes on your 
computer. Some volumes may not appear, so this may not be an exact one-to-one match with the volumes you saw 
in Disk Management earlier in the chapter. In this example, you see an HDD, a DVD, and a USB flash drive.

128
Part II: Software
File Extensions and File Types
Each application has a specific format in which it saves the files you 
create in it. To help identify the file format, some operating systems 
(including Microsoft Windows) use file extensions. A file extension is 
a code following the name of the file that indicates its type. Extensions 
are separated from the filename by a period, like this: Myfile.docx. In 
this example, docx is the extension, and it indicates the Microsoft Word 
format.
Almost all files have file extensions in Windows, not just data files. For 
example, the executable files that run applications also have extensions, 
as do the Windows system files and their helper files. Table 4.2 lists some 
of the most common file extensions and their applications.
file extension A code at the end of a filename 
that indicates the file’s type.

Chapter 4: Operating System Basics
TIP
You might not see a file’s extension in Windows Explorer. By default, Windows 7 hides extensions for known 
file types. If you want to display them, from Windows Explorer, open the Tools menu and click Folder Options. 
Click the View tab, clear the Hide Extensions for Known File Types check box, and click OK.
Table 4.2 shows some common default application assignments, but 
the actual application assigned to a particular extension depends on the 
settings in your operating system. You can configure the OS to associate 
a file type with any of the applications you have installed on your com-
puter. When an extension is assigned to an application, and you double-
click a data file with that extension, the data file automatically opens in 
the associated application (provided, of course, that the application is 
capable of handling that file type).
File Compression
Files can be made to take up less space by compressing them. Compressing 
a file applies an algorithm to it that makes the file smaller by storing 
it using more efficient notation. For example, suppose a file contains 
36 zeroes in a row. Each character occupies one byte of space, so that’s 
36 bytes. But a compression algorithm could rewrite that as 0x36, result-
ing in code that occupies only 4 bytes. When the file is needed, it is 
decompressed into its original form again, but when it is stored on disk, it 
is in the smaller form.
NTFS has an optional compression feature built in. You can enable or 
disable it for individual files and folders. The trade-off is that when a file 
or folder is compressed, it takes slightly longer to access it, because the 
internal compression algorithm must run before the decompressed file 
can be presented to you.
Another type of compression creates a compressed archive, which is a 
package file containing one or more files within a single compressed file. 
For example, files with a zip extension are compressed archives. Windows 
7 supports the zip archive format and treats zip files like folders. You can 
also use third-party utility programs such as WinZip to manage zipped 
archive files.

ing a calculation.

	 6.	Click OK to close the Properties box. A confirmation 
dialog box appears.
	 7.	Choose Apply Changes to This Folder Only, or choose 
Apply Changes to This folder, Subfolders and Files.
	
	 If you apply the change to the folder only, files and 
subfolders will be compressed only when they remain 
within this folder. If you apply the changes to all, files 
and subfolders will remain compressed when you move 
them to another location on an NTFS volume that is not 
compressed.
	 8.	Click OK.
	
	 Compressed folders and files appear in file listings with their names in bright blue, to help you remember that they 
are compressed.
Creating and Browsing a Compressed Archive File
Follow these steps to see how to create a compressed archive file in Windows 7: 
	 1.	Click Start, and then click Computer. Windows Explorer opens.
	 2.	Navigate to the location that contains the files you want to compress and archive together into a single file.
	 3.	Select the desired files and/or folders; then right-click the selection and choose Send To, and then click 
Compressed (zipped) Archive.
	
	 The compressed archive file appears in the listing, named the same as the first (alphabetically) of the files or  
folders. The name is selected so you can type a different name to change it.
	 4.	Type a new name for the compressed archive file, replacing the default one, and press Enter.

131
Chapter 4: Operating System Basics
File Encryption
Most operating systems, including Windows, allow users to make their 
files private so that no other users of the same PC can view or change 
them. However, a computer expert using special software can still find 
and view files from outside of the operating system, so the files are not 
really secure against someone who is determined to access them.
As an extra layer of security, NTFS can encrypt files. Encryption stores 
the files in a scrambled format, so that anyone browsing them from 
outside the operating system will see nothing useful. When an authorized 
user attempts to access them from within the operating system, the files 
are automatically decrypted (de-encrypted) and shown to the user as 
if they were not encrypted at all. NTFS’s compression and encryption 
features are mutually exclusive; you cannot enable both at once for the 
same file or folder. Encryption is available only in the Professional and 
Enterprise editions of Windows 7, so if you are using any other version 
(for example, Home Premium), it will not be available.
Some editions of Windows 7 also offer a feature called BitLocker, a 
whole-drive encryption feature that makes a certain volume inaccessible 
if the physical drive is removed from its current computer and placed in 
a different computer. BitLocker prevents thieves from stealing data by 
taking the entire hard drive out of a computer.
encrypt To scramble the contents of a file so it 
cannot be read without the required permission 
to decrypt it.
BitLocker A whole-drive encryption utility pro-
vided with some editions of Windows 7.
CAUTION
A risk of data loss exists whenever you use an encryption system; the data cannot be restored without the 
key, and if you lose the key, you lose your data. Therefore, if you use either of these systems, you should 
make sure you back up the encryption keys. Check the documentation for that feature to find out how. Many 
people decide that the risk of data loss is more serious than any benefit they might get from enhanced pri-
vacy and decide not to use encryption.

Part II: Software
Backups
Because storage media sometimes fail, it’s important to back up impor-
tant files frequently. Businesses spend thousands of dollars on robust, 
automated systems that back up their servers nightly, as well as key files 
on individual computers in some cases. Home and small-business users 
can use smaller backup systems designed for individual PCs.
Backup software can save your backup files to external media, such as 
a writeable DVD or an external hard drive, or to a network or Internet 
location. To save space on the backup media, backup software cre-
ates its own compressed archive files in its own proprietary format. To 
restore from the backup, you must use the same backup software that 
was employed to create the backup. A backup can span multiple discs or 
volumes, and can include multiple archive files. The collection of archive 
files created for a single backup instance is called a backup set.
Each time backup software runs, only a small portion of the files will have 
changed since the last backup was created. In order to reduce the amount 
of time the backup takes, not all storage is fully backed up every time. 
Instead, the backup software reads each file’s archive attribute (sometimes 
called an archive flag). When a file is backed up, its archive attribute is 
turned off. When the file changes, its archive attribute turns on again. The 
operating system manages the archive attribute for each file automatically. 
The backup software can be configured to skip any files where the archive 
attribute is off, which omits any unchanged files from the backup set.
You can do a full backup or a partial one. A full backup backs up every 
file in the specified list, and clears each one’s archive attribute (that is, sets 
it to Off). There are two types of partial backups. A differential backup 
backs up only files that have changed since the last full backup. Backing 
up the files does not change their archive attributes, so that the next time 
you do a backup, they are still marked to be backed up again. If you need 
to restore the files, you would need the last full backup set and then the 
most recent differential backup set. This method saves on media because 
you only have to keep two backup sets, and you can reuse the same media 
each time you perform a differential backup. However, the differential 
backup set gets larger every time you run it because more files will have 
changed, and over time the differential backup set can get fairly large. 
Therefore, a full backup should be done periodically (for example, every 
week or two) to keep the size of the differential backup set small.
An incremental backup, on the other hand, turns off the archive attri-
bute for each file as it backs it up. Therefore, each time you run an incre-
mental backup, it backs up only the files that have changed since the last 
incremental backup. If you need to restore the files, you would need the 
last full backup set and every incremental backup set that has been done 
since then. The backup runs quickly each time, because only the most 
recently changed files are backed up. However, the user has to maintain 
many backup sets to have a complete and current backup. Running a full 
backup creates another full set, and all the previous incremental backups 
can be discarded or overwritten.

TIP
Users who have just a few important files to back up may prefer to manually copy them to an external drive 
periodically rather than using backup software, especially if the files do not frequently change. Another 
way to ensure your important files are always available is to store them in a cloud storage system such as 
Microsoft’s OneDrive (formerly known as SkyDrive) or Apple’s iCloud. Companies that offer cloud storage use 
RAID systems, as described in Chapter 3, “Input, Output, and Storage,” to make sure data is constantly avail-
able, even if one or more drives fail.
Quick Review
	 1.	 Define the terms volume, root directory, and folder, and explain how they work together.
	 2.	 Explain how a single physical drive can have multiple volumes with different file systems on them.
	 3.	 Explain NTFS encryption and compression and the purpose of each.
	 4.	 Describe the difference between full, incremental, and differential backups.
Windows 7 comes with a backup utility called Backup and Restore. You 
can use it to back up your important files, and to schedule full, differ-
ential, or incremental backups to occur at regular intervals. You can also 
invest in third-party backup programs that have more features.

Summary
Understanding System Software
System software includes the BIOS, the operating system, and utility programs that perform 
system maintenance and protection.
A computer’s platform is its type of hardware. Only certain operating systems can run on certain 
platforms. The Intel platform, also called IBM-compatible, is the most popular platform; this 
platform’s most popular operating system is Windows. The 32-bit Intel platform is called x86, and 
the 64-bit version is called x64.
Most operating systems use a graphical user interface (GUI), but some operating systems, espe-
cially those designed for use on servers, use a command-line interface. UNIX is an example.
There are many types of utility software for performing various system maintenance tasks. 
Antivirus, firewall, and anti-spyware programs protect from outside attacks and malicious 
software (malware). Anti-spam programs cut down on the amount of junk email you receive. A 
disk checking program can find and fix file system errors, and a registry cleanup program can 
find and fix inconsistent or unneeded entries in the registry. Backup software can automate the 
process of backing up important files.
Comparing the Major Operating Systems
Mac OS X is the operating system on most Apple desktop and notebook computers. Its latest 
version is OS X 10.9, code named Mavericks. Its main competitor is Microsoft Windows, which 
is the most popular operating system in the world, used on more than 90% of all desktop and 
notebook PCs.
Linux is an open-source operating system based on UNIX. The basic version is free, but you can 
purchase a packaged collection of add-ons and utility programs with it called a distribution (distro). 
A distro typically includes a GUI as an alternative to Linux’s native command-line interface.
You can run multiple operating systems on a single computer by setting it up to multi-boot or to 
use a virtual machine to run the secondary operating system within the first one.
A thin client operating system such as Chrome OS is designed for small portable notebook com-
puters that are used primarily for going online.
A server is a computer that serves an entire network rather than an individual user. The most 
popular server operating systems are Linux, UNIX, and Windows Server.
Tablets and smartphones have an operating system that is preinstalled on a chip (system-on-
chip, or SoC). Users can download apps, which are add-on applications that extend the device’s 
capabilities. The popular SoC operating systems are iOS, Android, Windows RT, and Windows 
Phone.
Understanding Device Drivers
A device driver translates between the operating system and a hardware device. You can update 
a device driver to solve some performance problems you may have with the device, and roll back 
the driver if the new driver doesn’t work as well as the previous one.
When you install a new piece of hardware, Windows uses a technology called Plug and Play to 
identify the device and locate a driver for it if possible.

135
Chapter 4: Operating System Basics
Understanding Digital Storage
A drive is a physical storage unit. It can be partitioned into one or more logical volumes. 
Formatting a volume places a file system on it, which it will use to store its files. NTFS is the 
most popular file system for modern versions of Windows; FAT32 is an older file system used in 
earlier versions of Windows. HFS+ is the Mac OS X file system, and ISO 9660 (CD File System, 
or CDFS) and Universal Disc Format (UDF) are used for optical discs.
The top level of a storage volume is its root directory. A file’s path is the complete descriptor of 
its location, including the volume and any folders you pass through to get to it. A folder tree is 
a graphic representation of a volume’s folder structure. A file extension is a code following the 
filename that indicates its type.
File compression uses an algorithm to make the file smaller by storing it using more efficient 
notation. A compressed archive is a package file containing one or more other files. Encrypting 
a file stores it in a scrambled format so it cannot be snooped from outside of the operating sys-
tem interface. Some editions of Windows 7 come with a whole-drive encryption feature called 
BitLocker.
Backup software helps keep your data safe by backing it up to external media. The collection of 
files created for a single backup instance is a backup set. A backup can be full, differential, or 
incremental.

Linux Distros
Suppose you want to put Linux on an older desktop PC and give it to a relative who wants to 
use the Internet. But that person doesn’t know much about computers, so you must find a Linux 
distro that is very easy to use, even for a beginner. Do a web search on the terms Linux distro 
beginner. Based on the information you find, choose two Linux distros you think would meet your 
needs, and explain why you chose the ones you did.
Examining File Associations
Windows 7 has default extension associations for various file types. For example, when you 
double-click on a file with a txt extension, Windows 7 opens it in Notepad because Notepad is the 
default application for the txt extension.
When you have more than one application that is capable of opening a certain type of file, you may 
want to change Windows’s default setting for that extension. For example, if you have both Microsoft 
Word and WordPad, you might prefer one over the other for opening files with an rtf extension.
You can work with file associations in either of two ways. You can browse a list of applications 
and see what extensions are associated with each one, or you can browse a list of extensions and 
see what applications are associated with each one. Open the Control Panel in Windows 7, click 
Programs, and click Default Programs. Then examine the settings and options available there. To 
browse by program, choose Set Your Default Programs. To browse by extension, choose Associate 
a File Type or Protocol with a Program.
Think It Over
NTFS Compression and Encryption
NTFS compression and encryption both make files slightly slower to access. In addition, using 
encryption introduces another level of responsibility into file management because you must back 
up the encryption key so you can get your files back in the event of a system disaster that causes 
the hard drive to be inaccessible via the operating system. Given those drawbacks, do you think 
either of those features would be worth it to you, personally?
Backup Scheduling
Suppose you were designing your own backup schedule for your computer. Which folders or files 
would you back up? Regarding the files you did not choose to back up, why did you exclude them? 
How often would you perform a full backup? How often would you perform a differential or incre-
mental backup—and which would it be? Think about your answers, and give a reason for each one.

Careers in IT
Health IT Specialist
In many countries, governments have recently enacted 
laws that require health-care providers to computerize 
certain parts of their practices. For example, patient 
health records, medical billing, supply and drug inven-
tories, and medical equipment maintenance records 
will soon need to be in electronic form if they are not 
already. This requirement opens up many job opportu-
nities for health IT specialists. A health IT specialist 
plans and sets up health-care recordkeeping systems 
that meet all government requirements, and keep such 
systems up to date and in good repair. This job requires 
at least an associate’s degree in a computer-related 
field, with a bachelor’s or master’s degree preferred for 
supervisory positions.

A Tour of Windows 7
The Windows 7 interface, called the desktop, is your 
starting point for most of the activities you perform 
in Windows 7. From the desktop, you can run pro-
grams, manage files, access the Internet, check the 
status of devices, and more.
Your Windows desktop is like a physical workspace in 
some ways. You can have multiple files and projects 
open at the same time, spread out on the desktop so you 
can see each one of them. The desktop can be changed 
to suit your personal style. The desktop background can 
be a solid color, as in Figure 5.1, or it can be a picture 
of your choice. You will learn how to customize your 
desktop in Appendix B, “Customizing Windows 7.”
The taskbar is the thin bar across the bottom of the 
screen. It is used to start programs and to manage the 
programs that are already running. At the far-left end 
is the Start button. The small graphics you see on 
the desktop are called icons. An icon can sit on the 
desktop, as the Recycle Bin icon does in Figure 5.1, 
or it can be pinned to the taskbar for easy access. 
For example, in Figure 5.1, four pinned icons appear 
to the right of the Start button. The center of the 
taskbar is blank in Figure 5.1, but if any programs 
were running or windows open, buttons for those 
programs or windows would appear there. Some

other icons are at the right end of the taskbar, but these aren’t pinned 
there. That area is called the notification area (or system tray), and the 
icons there represent information from programs or system components 
that are running in the background, such as the Volume Control and the 
Battery Meter. At the far-right end of the taskbar is a clock.
Figure 5.1  The Windows 7 desktop.
When you click the Start button, the Start menu opens, as shown in 
Figure 5.2. It has two columns. In the left column, the top section con-
tains pinned shortcuts to applications. By default, there might not be any 
pinned shortcuts here; Figure 5.2 shows pinned shortcuts for Internet 
Explorer and Outlook. The bottom section of the left column contains 
shortcuts to recently or frequently used applications. This list changes 
depending on your usage. Below that is the All Programs command. It 
opens a hierarchical menu of all the installed programs on your system; 
you’ll learn more about it in the section “Running Applications” later in 
this chapter. At the bottom of the left column is a Search box; you can

Starting Up and Shutting Down
When you turn on the computer’s power, Windows 7 loads automati-
cally. Depending on the way your copy of Windows is configured, the 
desktop might appear automatically, or you might see a login screen.
NOTE
Windows 7 boots directly to the desktop without prompting for a user account or password if ALL the follow-
ing conditions are true: 1) There is only one user account set up on this PC (excluding the built-in Guest and 
Administrator accounts); 2) that user account has no password; and 3) the Guest account is disabled.
At the login screen, if your username appears with a password box 
under it, type the password and press Enter to log in. If several different 
usernames appear, click your account to select it. The options available at 
the login screen may vary depending on the edition of Windows 7 you 
have, and depending on whether the PC you are using is connected to a 
domain-based network.
See “Managing User Accounts” in Chapter 6 to learn how to add new 
accounts, change their passwords, and change the picture assigned to 
each account.
Shutting Down or Restarting the PC
When you shut down the PC, Windows shuts down and the computer 
stops using power. The next time you start the computer, Windows must 
reload itself into memory, which takes a minute or two. You should shut 
down a computer completely before moving it, storing it, or servicing 
it. You should also shut down the computer when prompted to do so by 
Windows itself. (A complete shutdown and restart is sometimes required 
to complete the installation of certain updates.) When you shut down 
the computer and then turn it back on again later, 
that’s called a cold boot because the computer’s 
circuitry has been off (and is therefore cold).
When you restart the PC, Windows shuts down, 
but the computer’s power remains on, and 
Windows immediately restarts. Restarting is also 
called a warm boot because the computer stays 
on (warm) as it reboots. You should restart when 
Windows prompts you to do so (for example, 
after updates have been installed), and also as 
a troubleshooting technique if you begin to 
experience problems with Windows. To restart 
Windows, choose Restart from the Shut Down 
button’s menu, as shown in Figure 5.3.

off state.

Troubleshooting
Restarting Helps!
If you talk to any computer professional about a problem you are having with your computer, the first thing he or 
she will probably ask you is: Have you tried restarting? That’s because restarting Windows can cure a variety of one-
time or occasional problems that may occur. For example, suppose your mouse pointer starts jumping around wildly 
as you move the mouse. That’s a problem with the display adapter, and it can almost always be cured by restarting 
the PC. Another common problem that restarting usually fixes is a keyboard that suddenly starts sending the wrong 
characters to the PC as you type.
Besides shutting down, there are several other ways to make the com-
puter use less (or no) power. You will learn about them in the section 
“Placing the PC in a Low-Power Mode,” later in this chapter.
Step by Step
Shutting Down a Windows 7 Computer
Follow these steps to shut down the computer completely and turn its 
power off:
	 1.	Click Start, and then click the Shut Down button.
	 2.	If any programs have unsaved files, a prompt appears for them. 
Respond to the prompt as needed.
Restarting a Windows 7 Computer
Follow these steps to restart the computer:
	 1.	Click Start, and then click the arrow to the right of the Shut Down 
button. A menu appears, as shown in Figure 5.3.
	 2.	Click Restart.
	 3.	If any programs have unsaved files, a prompt appears for them. 
Respond to the prompt as needed.
Placing the PC in a Low-Power Mode
Windows supports two special modes that you can place the computer 
in as an alternative to shutting down completely. In each of these modes, 
when the computer resumes operation, the desktop is just as you left it, 
including any open programs, windows, and files. This saves you time 
because you don’t have to wait as long for Windows to start up as you 
normally would, and when it does start up, you don’t have to reopen the 
applications and windows you want to continue working with.

145
Chapter 5: Introduction to Windows 7
Sleep mode is a low-power state. It keeps the RAM powered, but 
shuts down all other components. RAM doesn’t use much memory, 
so the computer consumes very little power. On a desktop computer, 
that means it uses less electricity. On a battery-powered computer, that 
means the battery lasts much longer. Waking up from Sleep mode is very 
quick—only a few seconds. Hibernate mode is a no-power-needed state. 
It copies the contents of RAM to a reserved area on the hard drive, and 
then shuts the power down completely. When the computer starts back 
up again, instead of booting normally, it reads the stored data back into 
memory, so you can pick up where you left off. Hibernate mode takes 
more time to wake up from than Sleep mode does (about 30 seconds, on 
the average), but that’s less time than it would take to start the computer 
from being completely shut down.
To place the computer in one of these modes, select it from the Shut 
Down button’s menu on the Start menu, as shown in Figure 5.3. 
Closing the lid on a notebook computer usually puts the system into 
sleep mode automatically; you may see the power light flashing intermit-
tently as an indication the computer is sleeping.
To wake up from Sleep mode, press any key on the keyboard. To wake 
up from Hibernate mode, press the computer’s Power button.
Sleep mode A power-saving mode that keeps 
RAM powered but turns off everything else to save 
power.
Hibernate mode A power-saving mode that 
saves the contents of RAM to the hard drive and 
then shuts down all power. When the computer 
wakes up, it reads the saved data back into 
RAM so the computer does not have to restart 
completely.
CAUTION
Not all computer hardware supports Hibernate mode. If you experience problems with the computer enter-
ing Hibernate mode, search online for troubleshooting help for your specific computer; there may be a BIOS 
(Basic Input Output System) update or driver update that can resolve the problem.
Stuck?
If your computer appears completely dead when you try to wake it up from Sleep or Hibernate mode, try hold-
ing down the computer’s Power button for 10 seconds. Doing so will shut the PC down completely, resetting any 
special power mode it was previously in. You may see an error message when you restart the computer about 
Windows not shutting down correctly, and offering to start Windows in a special mode. Don’t use a special mode; 
choose Start Windows Normally.
Troubleshooting
Logging Off and Switching Users
Windows 7 supports multiple user accounts. When one user is finished, 
he or she can log off, which shuts down any running programs, closes 
any open data files, unloads all personal settings for that user, and returns 
to the login screen, with all the available users listed. From that point 
another user can log in. Logging off closes the user’s personal activities 
down, but it does not completely restart Windows. Therefore, it takes 
less time than a full restart.
If another user wants to use the computer for a short time, the first user 
may not want to take the time to shut down all applications and data 
files that he or she is working on. The Switch User command suspends 
the current user’s session but does not end it, and returns to the login 
screen. Another user can then log in. The users can switch back and forth 
freely between the open accounts, and other users can even log in too.
log off To close a user account’s session, closing 
all open programs and data files and unloading all 
of that user’s personal settings.
Switch User A Windows feature that enables 
another user to log in without the original user 
logging off first.

146
Part II: Software
To use the Log Off or Switch User command, choose it from the Shut 
Down button’s menu, as shown in Figure 5.3.
TIP
Why not just let another person sit down and use the computer for a few minutes, without switching? That’s 
fine to do, as long as the first user doesn’t mind the lack of privacy. Each logged-in user has his or her own 
separate personal files and settings, and anyone who uses the computer while you are logged in can see 
your files. Switching users also enables each user to have his or her own preferred settings, such as display 
resolution and color scheme.
Locking the PC
If you are going to be away from your computer for a while, you might 
not want other people to be able to see what you were working on or 
snoop on your computer while you are gone. To prevent such intrusion, 
you can use the Lock command. Locking preserves the current state 
of the computer but redisplays the login screen. You must retype your 
password when you return to the computer to continue your session. 
Locking is similar to switching users except the login screen that appears 
shows the prompt only for the user who locked the PC, and not the full 
list of users that you see when you use Switch User.

Running Applications
As you learned in Chapter 1, “Computer Basics,” programs that per-
form some useful task (other than keeping the computer itself running) 
are known as applications. Running applications is the main reason 
Windows exists. Windows comes with a variety of small applications that 
it calls Accessories; these include a calculator, a text editor, a simple word 
processor, and a drawing program. You can also buy and install other 
applications on your own, and some computers come with some third-
party applications already installed, such as a DVD movie player or a 
productivity suite such as Microsoft Office.

Chapter 5: Introduction to Windows 7
Starting an Application
As you saw earlier in the chapter, the Start menu has a few shortcuts on 
it. The top section contains pinned shortcuts, and below that are short-
cuts to recently or frequently used applications. If the application you 
want to run isn’t in either of those places, you must click All Programs to 
open the full menu system. This menu system contains both application 
shortcuts and folders. If you click a folder, you see the shortcuts within 
it. The Start menu is hierarchically organized, just like the file system you 
learned about in Chapter 4, “Operating System Basics.” There are sub-
folders within folders, and files can exist at any level of the organizational 
structure. Figure 5.4 shows the Accessories folder expanded to show its 
subfolders, and the System Tools subfolder expanded below that, for 
example. Yours will look different because you have different applications 
installed than the PC illustrated here.
Figure 5.4  The All Programs menu with the Accessories folder expanded.

148
Part II: Software
Because the Start menu can get complicated with so many folders and 
shortcuts, you may find it easier to search for the application you want to 
run rather than browsing for it. To search for an app, after opening the 
Start menu, start typing the application’s name. The menu shows only 
the items that match what you typed. It is a full-featured search, and it 
finds all files on your hard drive, not just the applications on the Start 
menu. However, the Start menu applications appear at the top of the list, 
for easy access. In Figure 5.5, I typed quick, for example.
Figure 5.5  When you type a word (or part of a word), the Start menu shows the results of that search.
You can also start applications from shortcuts on the desktop or that are 
pinned to the taskbar or to the top of the Start menu. Just click the item 
you want on the Start menu or taskbar, or double-click the desired icon 
on the desktop.

149
Chapter 5: Introduction to Windows 7
Pinning Shortcuts
An easy way to refind an application on the Start menu is to pin it, either to the Start menu or to the taskbar. If 
you pin it to the Start menu, it appears in the upper-left quadrant of the Start menu. If you pin it to the taskbar, it 
appears to the right of the Start button. After locating the desired item on the Start menu, but before clicking it 
to select it, right-click it. On the menu that appears, choose Pin to Start Menu or Pin to Taskbar.
To place a shortcut on the desktop, minimize all open windows. Open the Start menu, locate the icon you 
want, and then hold down the Ctrl key as you drag the application off the Start menu; a copy will be created 
on the desktop. Make sure you hold down Ctrl as you drag; otherwise, the shortcut will be removed from the 
Start menu.
Put It to Work
Step by Step
Starting an Application
Follow these steps to start an application:
	 1.	Click Start.
	 2.	If you see a shortcut for the application you want, click it. Otherwise, do one of the following:
◾	 Click All Programs, and then click the application you want. Click a folder to open it if needed.
◾	 Start typing the application name, and then click the name when it appears at the top of the Start menu.
Manipulating a Window
As the name implies, Microsoft Windows is based on windows—
movable rectangular blocks in which different types of content appear. 
When you run an application, it appears in its own window, and when 
you browse a file listing, that listing appears in its own window too. 
Figure 5.6 illustrates some basic parts of a window.
Figure 5.6  Each window has these features in common.
The title bar is the bar across the top of the window. If the window 
holds an application, it shows the application’s name. If the application 
has a file open, it also shows the file’s name. You can move a window 
around onscreen by dragging its title bar.
window A movable rectangular block in which 
content appears.
title bar The bar across the top of a window that 
shows the window’s name; click the title bar and 
drag the window to move it.

150
Part II: Software
The buttons at the far-right end of the title bar control the window’s size.
	 Minimize: Hides the window by shrinking it down to a button 
on the taskbar. Use this button to get a window out of the way tem-
porarily without closing it.
	 Maximize: Enlarges the window to fill the entire screen. When 
a window is already maximized, this button changes to a Restore 
button, which returns the window to the size it was before you maxi-
mized it.
	 Close: Closes the window, exiting the application that was open 
in it (if applicable).
Each window has a border around its edges. You can position the mouse 
pointer over any part of the border and then drag to change the size of 
the window. If you drag a corner of the border, you can resize in both 
dimensions at once.

Follow these steps to resize a window:
	 1.	Position the mouse pointer over the window’s border. The pointer will turn into a double-
headed arrow.
	 2.	Hold down the left mouse button, and drag the border to change the window’s size.
Navigating in an Application
Most Windows-based applications have one of two interfaces: a menu 
interface or a Ribbon interface. A menu interface is typical of older 
applications and applications not developed by Microsoft; the Ribbon 
interface is common in newer Microsoft applications.
A menu-based interface has a menu bar across the top of the screen, 
immediately below the title bar. You can click a menu name to open the 
menu, as shown in Figure 5.7. Notice in Figure 5.7 that some com-
mands have keyboard shortcuts listed next to them. You can press those 
keys instead of using the menu system if you prefer.
menu bar A horizontal bar near the top of a 
window containing the names of menus that can 
be opened by clicking on the names.
keyboard shortcut Two or more keys that, 
when pressed in combination, issue a command.
TIP
If a program does not appear to have a menu bar, try pressing the Alt key. A menu bar may appear.

151
Chapter 5: Introduction to Windows 7
Figure 5.7  Menu-based application windows have these features.
Notice also that some commands have ellipses after them (. . .). These 
commands open dialog boxes, which are windows that prompt you for 
additional information. For example, if you click the Print command, the 
Print dialog box opens, prompting you to enter print settings, as shown 
in Figure 5.8.
Figure 5.8  Some menu commands open dialog boxes.
dialog box A window that appears in response 
to selecting a command, prompting for more infor-
mation about how the user wants the command to 
be executed.

152
Part II: Software
Dialog boxes have various ways of asking you for information. For 
example, the dialog box in Figure 5.8 has the following features:
◾	 Scrollable list: The list of printers at the top of the dialog box has 
a scroll bar beneath it. You can drag the scroll box from side to side 
to scroll the listing, or click the arrow at one end of the scroll bar 
to scroll in that direction.
◾	 Check box: A check box toggles a feature on or off. Click it to 
change its state.
◾	 Text box: A text box enables you to enter text or a number directly 
into it.
◾	 Increment buttons: Text boxes that only accept numeric values 
sometimes have increment buttons, which appear as small up and 
down arrows. You can click an arrow to increment (increase) or 
decrement (decrease) the number shown in the text box as an alter-
native to manually typing a number.
◾	 Option buttons: Option buttons present a group of mutually 
exclusive values. When one option button in a group is selected, 
the previous selection is cleared.
◾	 Command buttons: Command buttons are large rectangular 
buttons with text labels on them. Clicking a command button 
performs an action, such as the Print, Cancel, or Apply buttons in 
Figure 5.8, or opens another dialog box, as with the Preferences 
and Find Printer buttons.
Some menu-based applications contain one or more toolbars, which are 
groups of graphical buttons that serve as shortcuts for issuing certain com-
mands. In most cases, you can point at a button on a toolbar to see a pop-
up ScreenTip that tells the button’s name or purpose, as in Figure 5.9.
Figure 5.9  Some menu-based applications contain toolbars.
Ribbon-based applications do not have a menu bar or toolbar. Instead, 
they have a tabbed Ribbon, which is somewhat like a large multi-page 
toolbar. Each tab represents a different page of tools. Click a tab to 
access the buttons and other tools on that tab. Figure 5.10 shows an app 
called WordPad. It has two ordinary tabs, Home and View, containing 
commands you can select. It also contains a File tab, which is the blue 
tab to the left of the other two. The File tab opens a File menu, which 
contains commands for saving, opening, closing, and printing files. 
Microsoft Office programs use this same type of interface, so you will 
become very familiar with it in upcoming chapters.
toolbar A group of graphical buttons representing 
commands.
Ribbon The main toolbar in Office applications 
and some other Windows applications, consisting 
of multiple tabbed pages of commands.

TIP
In most Ribbon-based applications, there is also a small toolbar above the tabs called the Quick Access 
toolbar. You can add a copy of any button to this toolbar to keep it handy. To add a button to it, right-click the 
button on the Ribbon and choose Add to Quick Access Toolbar.
In most applications, both menu-based and Ribbon-based, you can 
right-click to open a shortcut menu (also called a context menu) and 
select commands from there. The shortcut menu’s content changes 
depending on what you right-click and what you are doing. For example, 
if you right-click some text that you’ve selected, the shortcut menu con-
tains commands to cut and copy it, as shown in Figure 5.11.
Figure 5.11  Right-clicking in an application opens a  
context-sensitive shortcut menu.
Exiting an Application
To close an application, close its window by clicking the Close (X) but-
ton in the upper-right corner, or open its File menu and choose Exit, or 
press Alt+F4 when the application window is active.

Using Internet Explorer
This book devotes an entire chapter (Chapter 15, “Web Basics”) to using Internet Explorer (IE), but you will prob-
ably need to use the web before you get to that chapter to complete some of your assignments, so here is a very 
quick overview.
Windows 7 has a shortcut to Internet Explorer pinned to the taskbar, so you can start IE from there if you like, or 
you can click the Start button and click Internet Explorer at the top of the Start menu.
The page that appears initially depends on what page has been set as the default (referred to as the Home page). If 
you are accessing IE from your school or work, a page may have been assigned for you specific to that organization.
To go directly to a specific address (called a Uniform Resource Locator, or URL), type it in the address bar. You can also 
use the address bar to perform searches. Instead of entering a specific address in the address bar, type some keywords 
there, or even a whole sentence. Your default search engine will return a list of pages that meet your search criteria.
Use the Back button to return to a previous page. To go back several steps at once, hold the mouse button down 
on the Back button to open a menu of previously viewed pages.
To open a link in a new tab, right-click the link and choose Open in New Tab. You can then switch back and forth 
freely between the open pages by clicking their tabs. You can also start a new tab without specifying a page to 
show on it by clicking the New Tab button to the right of the rightmost displayed tab.
address bar The field above the menu bar in 
Windows Explorer that shows the current path.
Managing Files
As you learned in Chapter 4, “Operating System Basics,” a computer’s 
file system consists of physical drives that contain volumes that have 
letters (with colons) assigned to them, like C: and D:. Each volume can 
contain folders, and each folder can contain files. Files can also exist at 
the top level of a volume’s organization (its root directory).

155
Chapter 5: Introduction to Windows 7
In Windows 7, Windows Explorer is the tool for managing files. 
“Managing” is a pretty broad term, encompassing all the various opera-
tions you might perform on a file, including moving, copying, renaming, 
deleting, and viewing its properties. The rest of this chapter is devoted to 
teaching you those skills.
Understanding the Windows 
Explorer Interface
In many ways, Windows Explorer resembles any other window. It has 
a title bar, a menu bar, and window controls, all of which you learned 
about earlier in this chapter. It also has some extra features, though, that 
not every window has, shown in Figure 5.12.
Figure 5.12  Windows Explorer has some tools and features that most application windows 
don’t have.
◾	 Navigation bar: The pane on the left side of the Windows Explorer 
window contains links for displaying various locations, both on your 
local computer and on any networks you may be connected to.
◾	 Command bar: This extra bar below the menu bar contains an 
Organize button that opens a menu, and also other commands, 
which change depending on what location you are viewing. On the 
far-right end of the command bar are the Change Your View but-
ton (which opens a menu of available views), a Preview Pane button 
(which toggles a preview pane on and off), and a Get Help but-
ton (which opens the Help system).

156
Part II: Software
◾	 Address bar: The address bar, which appears above the menu bar, 
shows the current path. You learned about paths in Chapter 4, 
“Operating System Basics,” in the section “How Files Are 
Organized in Folders.”
◾	 Status bar: This bar appears at the bottom of the window, and 
reports information about the currently displayed or selected loca-
tion or objects.
◾	 Search box: To find a particular file or folder in Windows 
Explorer, you can type a part of its name in the Search box and 
press Enter. The Search feature looks in files, folders, and objects 
in your Outlook data file (if you have one) and looks at both the 
filenames and their contents.
Navigating to Different Locations
When you open Windows Explorer, the location shown depends on 
how you opened it. For example, the Start menu has several links on it 
that all open different locations (Computer, Documents, Pictures, and 
Music). In addition, the Windows Explorer shortcut on the taskbar 
opens Windows Explorer to the Libraries window. (You will learn about 
libraries later in this chapter.) You can easily navigate to any location in 
Windows Explorer, so it doesn’t matter from which location you start.
One way to navigate to a different location is to click one of the links in 
the navigation pane (the left pane). The navigation pane contains these 
expandable sections, as shown in Figure 5.13:
◾	 Favorites: Contains shortcuts for a few common locations, such as 
the desktop and Recent Places. You can also add your own location 
shortcuts here, for easy access to the locations you use the most.
◾	 Libraries: Contains shortcuts for the Documents, Music, Pictures, 
and Videos libraries for the logged-in user account. (They are sepa-
rate for each user account.)
◾	 Homegroup: If your computer is part of a homegroup, a link to 
it appears. A homegroup is a type of networking used in home and 
small-business workgroup environments. You learn more about 
networking in Chapter 13, “Networking and Internet Basics.”
◾	 Computer: Contains a list of all the local volumes in an expandable 
folder tree.
◾	 Network: Contains shortcuts for browsing a network if you are 
connected to one.
To expand a section, double-click its name, or point to it (so that a white 
triangle appears to its left) and then click the triangle to expand it. When 
a section is expanded in the folder tree, the triangle next to it appears 
black; click the black triangle to collapse the section again.
homegroup A small group of mutually trusted 
computers on a peer-to-peer network such as in a 
home or small office.

157
Chapter 5: Introduction to Windows 7
You can also navigate by double-clicking a folder in the main pane. For 
example, you could start out by clicking Computer in the navigation 
pane to display a list of volumes, and then double-clicking the C: volume, 
and then double-clicking a folder in the listing that appears, and keep 
double-clicking folders until you arrive at the file you are seeking.
If you want to go back one step in your navigation, click the Back button 
in the upper-left corner. The Forward button next to it takes you one 
step forward again after you have used Back.
If you want to go up one or more levels in the hierarchy, you can expand 
the folder tree in the navigation pane and click the folder location to 
jump to, or you can click the folder name in the address bar. You can also 
click any of the triangles between the folder names in the address bar to 
open a menu of locations at that same level and then click any location 
from the menu to jump to it.
Figure 5.13  Locations in the navigation pane.

158
Part II: Software
Changing the View of a Location
You can view the current location in the main pane in a number of dif-
ferent ways. Click the Change Your View button to toggle through the 
available views, or click the down arrow to the right of that button to 
open a menu of views and then click the one you want, or drag the slider 
up or down to a different view. See Figure 5.14.
Figure 5.14  Open the Change Your View button’s menu to select a view.
TIP
The menu has a slider because you aren’t limited to just the presets on the menu; you can position the slider 
halfway between two settings for additional choices. For example, if you position the slider between Large and 
Extra-Large, you get icons that are halfway between those two options in size.
Understanding Libraries
A library is not a folder, although it looks like one. It is a virtual folder 
created by combining the contents of several different folders in one 
pane. The Libraries feature enables you to work with the contents of 
many different locations at once, without worrying about where a par-
ticular file is actually stored.
Windows 7 comes with four libraries already set up for you: Documents, 
Music, Pictures, and Videos. Your libraries are unique to your user 
account; if someone else logs into the same PC, he will see his own 
libraries instead of yours. This provides for some privacy when multiple 
people share a computer. You can also create other libraries if you like.
library A virtual folder that combines the 
contents of one or more specified folders into a 
single view.
virtual folder A view that resembles a folder 
but has no direct equivalent in the computer’s file 
system.
NOTE
Although the default library names reflect the types of files that Windows suggests you store in them, libraries 
are not limited to certain file types. You can store any files in any libraries.
Each library monitors the contents of one or more locations. For 
example, the Documents library monitors two folders by default: the 
logged-in user’s personal Documents folder (C:\Users\username\My 
Documents) and a Public Documents folder (C:\Users\Public\Public 
Documents). You can set it to monitor other locations as well.

159
Chapter 5: Introduction to Windows 7
When you save a file to your Documents library, where is that file actually 
saved, if the library represents multiple locations? That depends on which 
folder is set up to be the save location. In the Documents library, for 
example, the default save location is C:\Users\username\My Documents.
save location The location where files are saved 
when a user saves them to a library.
Step by Step
Setting a Library to Monitor Additional Folders
Follow these steps to add another folder to a library’s Locations list:
	 1.	In Windows Explorer, in the navigation pane, right-click the 
desired library and choose Properties. The Properties dialog 
box opens for that library.
	 2.	Click Include a Folder.
	 3.	Navigate to the desired folder, select it, and then click the 
Include button.
	 4.	Click OK.
Changing the Save Location for a Library
Follow these steps to change which folder a library stores files in 
when you save to that library:
	 1.	In Windows Explorer, in the navigation pane, right-click the 
desired library and choose Properties. The Properties dialog 
box opens for that library.
	 2.	In the Library Locations list, click the folder you want to use as 
the save location.
	 3.	Click Set Save Location.
	 4.	Click OK.
Creating a New Library
Follow these steps to create a new library:
	 1.	In Windows Explorer, in the navigation pane, right-click 
Libraries, and on the menu that appears, point to New, 
and then click Library.
	 2.	In Windows Explorer, in the navigation pane, right-click 
Libraries, and on the menu that appears, point to New, 
and then click Library. A new library appears in the list, 
named New Library.
	 3.	Right-click New Library and choose Properties. The 
Properties dialog box for the new library opens.
	 4.	Add folders to the new library using the steps from “Setting a Library to Monitor Additional Folders.”
	 5.	Choose the save location using the steps from the preceding instructions for “Changing the Save Location for a Library.”
	 6.	Open the Optimize This Library For: drop-down list and choose the file type that is most appropriate for this library, 
or leave it set to General Items if the library will contain a variety of content.
	 7.	 (Optional) If you do not want this library to appear in the navigation pane under Libraries, clear the Shown in 
Navigation Pane check box.
	 8.	Click OK.
	 9.	You may wish to change the name from New Library to one of your choosing. Right-click New Library, choose 
Rename, and type the new name into the text box.

Part II: Software
Selecting Files and Folders
Before you can issue a command that affects a file or folder (for example, 
to move or copy it), you must first select that file or folder. If you are 
selecting only one file or folder, it’s easy—just click it. It becomes high-
lighted. (The highlighting color varies depending on the color scheme you 
are using in Windows.) If, however, you want to act upon multiple files or 
folders at once, you must select them all before issuing the command.
When two or more files or folders are contiguous (adjacent) in the file 
listing, you can select them by clicking the first one and then holding 
down the Shift key while you click the last one. All the files between the 
two are also selected. When the files you want are non-contiguous (not 
adjacent), hold down the Ctrl key and then click individually on each one. 
See Figure 5.15. When you are finished making your selections, release 
the Ctrl key. To cancel a selection, click anywhere away from the selection.
contiguous Physically adjacent to one another. 
non-contiguous Not adjacent.
TIP
To select all the files and folders in the current location, press Ctrl+A.
Creating New Folders
As you work in Windows, you may want to create new folders to orga-
nize your data. For example, you might create a separate folder for each 
project you work on. You could create them in your My Documents 
folder, so that they show up in your Documents library, or in another 
other location on any volume to which you have access.
To create a new folder, click the New Folder button on the command 
bar in Windows Explorer. A new folder appears with a generic name, 
with the name highlighted so you can easily change it. See Figure 5.16. 
Type the new name and press Enter.

in Windows Explorer that contains an Organize 
button that opens a menu, and also other com-
mands, which change depending on what location 
you are viewing.

TIP
An alternative way of creating a folder is to right-click a blank area of the file listing, point to New, and click 
Folder. Yet another way is to open the File menu, point to New, and click Folder.
Renaming and Deleting Files and Folders
There are many different ways to rename a file or folder. You can do any 
of the following:
◾	 Select the file or folder and press F2 to make the name editable. 
Type the new name and press Enter.
◾	 Click the file or folder to select it and then click it again to move 
the insertion point into the name. Edit the name and press Enter.
◾	 Right-click the file or folder and click Rename. Edit the name and 
press Enter.
◾	 Select the file or folder and then open the File menu and choose 
Rename. Edit the name and press Enter.
To delete a file or folder, select it and then do any of the following:
◾	 Press the Delete key on the keyboard.
◾	 Right-click the file and folder and click Delete.
◾	 Open the File menu and click Delete.
CAUTION
You can rename any file or folder. That does not mean, however, that you should. Many folders and files 
are part of installed applications or Windows itself, and if you rename them, they may no longer function as 
intended. To be safe, rename only files and folders that you have created.

162
Part II: Software
Deleting a file sends it to the Recycle Bin, which is a temporary holding 
area for deleted content. You can retrieve a deleted file or folder from the 
Recycle Bin.
Step by Step
Restoring a Deleted Item from the Recycle Bin
Follow these steps to retrieve a file or 
folder that you have deleted: 
	 1.	Double-click the Recycle Bin 
icon on the desktop to open the 
Recycle Bin window.
	 2.	Select the deleted item to 
restore.
	 3.	Click the Restore This Item but-
ton on the command bar.
Moving and Copying Files and Folders
You can move and copy files and folders from and to any location. This 
enables you to transfer your data files from your hard drive to a remov-
able drive such as a USB flash drive, for example.
CAUTION
The same warning applies to moving files as to deleting them: If you move a file that an application or 
Windows relies on, Windows or an application may not function as expected anymore.
There are many ways to move and copy items. You can use the Windows 
Clipboard, or drag and drop files from one location to another, or you 
can use the Move to Folder or Copy to Folder command in Windows 
Explorer.
The Windows Clipboard is a temporary storage area in memory. When 
you use the Cut operation on an object (or group of objects), it is 
removed from its current location and placed on the Clipboard. Or, 
when you use the Copy operation on an object, the object remains in the 
current location but a copy of it is placed on the Clipboard. Then when 
you use the Paste operation, it is copied from the Clipboard to a new 
location. The object remains on the Clipboard until something else is 
Clipboard A reserved area in memory for tempo-
rarily holding content that has been cut or copied 
from an application or from Windows Explorer.

163
Chapter 5: Introduction to Windows 7
placed there with either another Cut or another Copy operation. In this 
chapter, you use the Clipboard to copy and move files, but it can also be 
used to move or copy snippets of data from applications into other appli-
cations. For example, you can use it to copy certain cells from an Excel 
spreadsheet into a Microsoft Word document or into an email message 
you are composing.
Table 5.2 lists the various ways of activating the Cut, Copy, and Paste 
commands in Windows 7.

Drag-and-drop is a technique for moving items from place to place. 
You can open the source and the destination locations in separate File 
Explorer windows onscreen and then drag items between them. When 
you drag between two locations on the same volume, the drag operation 
moves by default; if you want it to copy, hold down the Ctrl key as you 
drag. When you drag between two locations on different volumes, the 
drag operation copies by default; if you want it to move, hold down Shift 
as you drag.
TIP
If you are not sure whether the two locations are on the same volume, you can be sure you get the operation 
you want (move or copy) by always holding down Shift as you drag for a move and always holding down Ctrl as 
you drag for a copy. Alternatively, you can right-drag instead of dragging with the left mouse button. When you 
do so, a menu appears when you release the mouse button, enabling you to select a move or copy operation.
The Move to Folder and Copy to Folder commands (both on the Edit 
menu) are unique to Windows Explorer, and provide an alternative to 
the other two methods just described. They enable you to move or copy 
using a dialog box interface.
If you want to move items to a removable drive such as a USB flash 
drive, there is yet another method available. Right-click the selected 
item(s) and select Send To from the context menu that is displayed, and 
then click the removable drive from the menu that appears.

Working with Shortcuts
A shortcut is a link, or pointer, to the original file to which it refers. 
It allows a file or folder to appear to be in two or more locations at 
once, while maintaining a single original copy of it. For example, all the 
program names on the Start menu are shortcuts to the executable files 
that run those programs, as are the shortcut icons on the left end of the 
taskbar. You can also place shortcuts directly on the desktop.
Some shortcuts appear with a small arrow in the lower-left corner of the 
icon, indicating that the icon represents a shortcut rather than the original 
file, and some of them have the word “shortcut” in their name, as shown 
in Figure 5.17. However, not all shortcuts follow these conventions, so 
it is not a sure way to differentiate a shortcut from a regular file. A better 
method is to right-click the icon and choose Properties. If the dialog box 
that appears contains a Shortcut tab, the icon is a shortcut icon.
shortcut A pointer to a file or folder.
Step by Step
Moving or Copying (Clipboard Method)
Follow these steps to move or copy selected files or folders using the Windows Clipboard: 
	 1.	In Windows Explorer, select the file(s) and/or folder(s) to be moved or copied.
	 2.	Press Ctrl+C to copy, or press Ctrl+X if you want to move. Or, use one of the other methods from Table 5.2.
	 3.	Navigate to the location where you want to paste the cut or copied item(s).
	 4.	Press Ctrl+V to paste. Or, use one of the other methods from Table 5.2.
Moving or Copying (Drag-and-Drop Method)
Follow these steps to move or copy selected files or folders using drag-and-drop:
	 1.	In Windows Explorer, select the file(s) and/or folder(s) to be moved or copied.
	 2.	Open another Windows Explorer window (for example, click Start and click Computer) and navigate to the destina-
tion location.
	 3.	Arrange the two windows so that both are visible at once.
	 4.	Hold down Ctrl to copy, or hold down Shift to move. (See the note earlier in this section about the need to use 
those keys.)
	 5.	Drag the selected item(s) from the original location to the 
destination.
Moving or Copying (Dialog Box Method)
Follow these steps to move or copy selected files or folders using the 
Move to Folder or Copy to Folder command:
	 1.	In Windows Explorer, select the file(s) and/or folder(s) to be 
moved or copied.
	 2.	Open the Edit menu and click Move to Folder or Copy to Folder. 
The Move Items or Copy Items dialog box opens.
	 3.	Navigate to the desired destination location. Use the same 
navigation techniques you use in the folder tree in the naviga-
tion pane.
	 4.	Click the Move (or Copy) button.

Chapter 5: Introduction to Windows 7
Figure 5.17  An original file (left) and a shortcut that refers to it (right).
To create a shortcut, right-drag the original file to another location. 
When you release the mouse button, a menu appears. On that menu, 
click Create Shortcuts Here. This works to create a shortcut almost any-
where. For example, you can drag an item from the Start menu or from a 
Windows Explorer screen to the desktop or to the taskbar.
You can work with shortcuts just like any other files. You can rename 
them, for example, in the same way you learned to rename files earlier 
in this chapter. You can move them and copy them freely. To delete a 
shortcut, delete it as you would any other file. Deleting a shortcut does 
not delete the file to which it refers.

Summary
A Tour of Windows 7
The desktop is the heart of the Windows 7 interface. The key features of the desktop include the 
taskbar and icons. On the taskbar is the Start button, pinned icons, buttons for running applica-
tion windows, the notification area, and the clock, from left to right.
When you click the Start button, the Start menu appears, with links to commonly or recently 
used programs and locations appear. Click All Programs to see the full list of programs you can 
run, or type the first few letters of what you seek into the Search box.
Starting Up and Shutting Down
Windows starts up automatically when you turn on the computer. You are prompted to log in with 
your user ID and to type a password if your account has one assigned to it. A cold boot is one 
where the computer has been off; a warm boot is a restart with the computer already on.
Sleep mode is a power-saving mode that keeps RAM powered but turns off everything else. 
Hibernate mode saves the contents of RAM to the hard drive and then shuts down all power.
When a user is finished with the computer, he or she can log off, which shuts down any running 
programs, closes open data files, and unloads that user’s personal settings. To allow someone else 
to log in without the first user logging out, use Switch User. To return to a login screen without 
closing out of programs and applications, use the Lock command.
Running Applications
To start an application, choose it from the Start menu. If you don’t see it on the top level menu, 
click All Programs to find it, or type its name in the Search box.
A window is a movable rectangular block in which content appears, such as an application or file 
listing. Each window has a title bar at the top of it. In the right corner of the title bar are window 
control buttons: Minimize, Maximize (or Restore), and Close. To resize a window, drag one of 
its borders. To move a window, drag its title bar.
To navigate within an application, use its menu bar. Some commands have keyboard shortcuts 
for speeding up your work. Some commands open dialog boxes for providing more information. 
Programs with a menu bar sometimes have a toolbar, which is a row of clickable icons. A Ribbon 
is a multi-page, more sophisticated version of a toolbar.
To exit an application, click the window’s Close button, or open the File menu and choose Exit, 
or press Alt+F4.
Managing Files
The parts of a Windows Explorer window include the navigation bar, command bar, address 
bar, status bar, and Search box.
You can navigate to different locations using the shortcuts in the navigation pane in the Favorites 
list, or select one of the libraries from the Libraries list. If you are connected to a network, you 
can browse network locations from the Homegroup or Network lists. Use the Computer list to 
browse local volumes. To change the view of a location, click the Change Your View button, or 
click the down arrow to the right of that button to open a menu of views and then click the one 
you want.

167
Chapter 5: Introduction to Windows 7
Libraries are virtual folders that combine the contents of several locations into one window. 
The default libraries are Documents, Pictures, Music, and Videos for each user. You can create 
your own libraries too, and set up libraries to monitor additional folders. Each library has a Save 
Location, which is the folder that files are placed in when saved to the library.
To select contiguous files and folders, hold down Shift as you click the first and last ones. To 
select non-contiguous files and folders, hold down Ctrl as you click each one individually. To cre-
ate a new folder, click the New Folder button on the command bar.
To rename a file or folder, select it, press F2, type the new name, and press Enter. To delete a file 
or folder, select it and press the Delete key. Deleted files go to the Recycle Bin; you can retrieve 
them from there.
You can move and copy files using the Clipboard, drag-and-drop, or use the Move to Folder or 
Copy to Folder command.
A shortcut is a pointer to a file or folder. To create a shortcut, right-drag an object to a new loca-
tion and on the shortcut menu that appears when you release the mouse button, choose Create 
Shortcuts Here.

Sorting File Listings
Windows Explorer enables you to sort the file listing by name, date, or other characteristics. To do 
this, right-click a blank area of the file list, point to Sort By, and click the characteristic by which 
you want to sort. If you display the file list in Details view, you can also click one of the column 
headings to sort by that heading (for example, Type or Size). Try this out for yourself. Display 
the contents of the root directory of the C: volume in Details view, and sort the listing by Type. 
Sorting a file listing can make the files you want to work with contiguous, so you can use the Shift 
key method of selecting them that you learned about earlier in this chapter.
Looking at File Properties
Each file has properties that you can view by right-clicking it and choosing Properties from the 
menu. In a file’s Properties box you will find a General tab that has file attributes on it and a 
Security tab that enables you to configure its security settings. Depending on the file type, there 
may also be other tabs, such as Details and Previous Versions (for some types of data files). If it’s 
an application, there may be a Compatibility tab, on which you can configure the program to run 
with settings compatible for an earlier version of Windows. If it’s a shortcut, a Shortcut tab offers 
settings for changing the shortcut’s properties. Working on your own, open C:\Program Files in 
Windows Explorer and examine the properties of at least one folder and at least three files, and 
compare the tabs and settings that are available to view and adjust.
Compatibility Mode
Some older applications do not run well under 
Windows 7, but there’s a workaround. You can 
set an application to run in Compatibility mode 
with settings that simulate an earlier Windows 
version of your choice. To set this up, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	Right-click the executable file for the 
program, or a shortcut that you use to 
run the program (such as its shortcut on 
the Start menu) and choose Properties.
	
2.	On the Compatibility tab, tick the 
check box next to the Run This 
Program in Compatibility Mode.
	
3.	Open the drop-down list of versions 
and choose an earlier Windows ver-
sion. If you know which version the 
program was designed for, choose 
that. Otherwise, choose Windows XP 
(Service Pack 3). If that one doesn’t 
work, you can come back later and try 
the next-latest version, and so on, until 
you find the one that works.
	
4.	Click OK. Then try running the program 
again to see if the new settings help.

Chapter 5: Introduction to Windows 7
Think It Over
Desktop Shortcuts
Some people like to have shortcuts for all the applications they use on the desktop, so they can 
access them easily without having to use the Start menu. Their desktops become covered with 
dozens of icons over time. Other people prefer to keep the desktop clean, showing only the 
Recycle Bin, and they pin shortcuts only to the taskbar and Start screen. What is your preference, 
and why? Are there any drawbacks to pinning lots of icons to the desktop? To the taskbar? To the 
Start screen?
Security versus Convenience
How important is your privacy on your computer? Is it worth it to you in terms of privacy to have 
a separate user account from everyone else who uses your computer? Do you feel more comfort-
able stepping away from the computer while you are logged in if you use the Lock feature to 
password-protect it from others? Or would you rather have the computer be completely open to 
everyone in your family, with no private information?
New Applications
Suppose you bought a new application and it doesn’t use either a Ribbon or a menu system, at 
least not like the ones you have encountered before. How would you figure out how to use the 
program? What are some of the resources that might be available to you?

Managing User Accounts
When Windows 7 is installed on a computer, the installation program 
automatically creates a user account. It prompts you during the instal-
lation process for a username for that account. You can continue to use 
that account all the time, or you can create additional accounts.
When you turn on the computer, a login screen appears with the names 
and pictures of each user account. You can click the one you want to log 
in with, and if it has a password, you are prompted for the password.
user account An account associated with an 
individual person, used for authenticating the user 
when he or she logs into Windows.
NOTE
If the system has only one user account and it is not password-protected, the Windows desktop may appear 
automatically when you start the computer, without a prompt to log in.
There is no fixed limit to the number of accounts you can have on a 
single copy of Windows. Keep in mind, however, that each account takes 
up a certain amount of hard drive space for its files, so make sure there is 
adequate hard drive space if several people use the same computer.
Careers in IT
Help Desk Technician
If you enjoy working with Microsoft Windows settings, as you learn 
how to do in this chapter, you might like a career as a Help Desk tech-
nician. In this career, you assist end users in making system changes, 
troubleshooting problems with Windows, managing a database of 
authorized users, and helping decide on appropriate policies for the 
company’s computers that will allow users to do their work in safety 
and privacy. To be a Help Desk technician, you should have at least an 
associate’s degree in Computer Technology or a related field.
Administrator versus Standard Users
There are two types of Windows 7 accounts: Administrator and 
Standard. An Administrator account has full permission to do anything, 
including installing and removing software and changing system settings. 
Each system must have at least one Administrator account. A Standard 
account has fewer permissions. A Standard user cannot install or remove 
software and cannot make system changes that affect other users. For 
example, a Standard user could adjust his own desktop colors and change 
his own password, but could not delete someone else’s user account or 
install a new version of an application.
Administrator account A user account that 
has full permission to modify all aspects of 
Windows 7.
Standard account A user account that can 
only make changes to Windows 7 that do not 
affect other users.

175
Chapter 6: Windows 7 Administration and Maintenance
Microsoft recommends that most people use Windows with a Standard 
account for their daily work and play, and log into an Administrator 
account(s) only when needed. Following this policy minimizes the risk 
of inexperienced users or malware making system changes that degrade 
the system’s performance or cause it to stop working altogether. See 
Chapter 16, “Network and Internet Privacy and Security,” for more 
information about malware.
You can make changes to the currently logged-in user account or to any 
other account. If you are logged in as an Administrator, no additional 
permission is needed. If you are logged in as a Standard user, you will be 
prompted to enter an Administrator user name and password if you try 
to act on another account.
malware Malicious software that consists of pro-
grams designed to disrupt the normal operation of 
computer systems.
Biometric Authentication
In the future, you may use some other method of log-
ging into a computer than a password. For example, 
some computers have a biometric authentication sys-
tem that determines the person’s identity based upon 
some physical characteristic, such as fingerprints, facial 
appearance, or retinal scan. This technology is available 
today and is becoming more and more popular as the 
price of the scanning hardware lowers. Some notebook 
computers have fingerprint readers built in. Another 
biometric authentication method is facial recognition, 
in which a camera (such as the computer’s built-in 
webcam) takes a picture of the person sitting at the 
keyboard and compares it to the picture on file of the 
authorized user(s). Facial recognition software is built 
into Windows 8.0 and higher.
New Technologies

TIP
If you are logged in as a Standard user and want to perform an action that requires an Administrator account, 
you do not always have to log out and back in again as a different user. In some cases, you can right-click the 
program or setting you want to access and choose Run as Administrator from the menu that appears. You can 
then select an account that has the needed permission and enter its password.
Each account has a picture that appears next to the name on the login 
screen. Windows automatically assigns a picture to the account when you 
create it, but you can change the picture to any one you like, including a 
photo of yourself.
Occasionally, you might need to delete an account that is no longer used. 
Deleting an account frees up hard drive space and also simplifies the 
login screen. When you delete an account, you have a choice of keeping 
the personal files associated with that account or deleting them. If you 
choose to keep them, the files are placed in a folder on the desktop, and 
you can relocate them where you want them from there.

Chapter 6: Windows 7 Administration and Maintenance
Account Passwords
Both Standard and Administrator accounts can have passwords, but 
Windows does not require this. Microsoft recommends that all accounts 
have passwords, but it is especially important that Administrator accounts 
have passwords. Without a password on an account, anyone may log in 
using that account.
password A word, phrase, or string of characters 
that a user enters in order to authenticate his or 
her identity.
TIP
To avoid problems with unauthorized people guessing your password and using it to access your computer 
without permission, use a strong password. Avoid using your name or the names of any of your friends, 
family, or pets as a password, and avoid using words found in the dictionary. The strongest passwords use 
a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters as well as numbers and symbols. If you find it difficult to 
remember a strong password, create one with a combination of letters and numbers that will make sense to 
only you. For example, you could start with a common word, such as happiness, and then substitute numbers 
for certain letters, like this: h2pp5n7ss. In this example, the numbers have been inserted in place of the 
vowels, and the number used is the position of the letter in the word. Make up your own system to create a 
password that is easy to remember but difficult to guess.
strong password A password that is difficult for 
others to guess.
Windows has a Guest account that has no password. People who do not 
have a user account on your computer may use it to gain limited access 
to the computer, to carry out tasks such as use the Internet or run simple 
built-in programs like the Windows Calculator or Notepad. By default, 
the Guest account is disabled, but you can easily enable it if you want it 
to be available, as described in the following Step by Step section.
Guest account A special Windows account that 
has very few permissions, optionally offered at 
start-up so users who do not have an account on

Parental Controls
Not all computer activity is appropriate for all users. For example, you 
might not want your children to have access to certain violent games 
or to use the computer at certain times of day. The Parental Controls 
feature of Windows 7 allows an Administrator user to set limits on other 
users’ activities.
You can limit three types of activities with Parental Controls: time limits, 
games, and specific applications.
The Time Limits feature enables you to prevent the account from using 
the computer on certain days and at certain times. This can be useful to 
prevent a child from using the computer when no adults are available 
to supervise the activities. You can specify certain days of the week and 
certain hours within each day, as shown in Figure 6.1.

The Games setting enables you to specify a rating level, above which 
all games are blocked. This setting applies not only to already installed 
games but also to new games the user might install. Not all games have 
ratings, and you can choose to allow or block games with no rating. You 
can also block specific games of your choosing, regardless of the rating.
The game ratings are determined by the Entertainment Software 
Ratings Board (ESRB).  Each game is assigned a rating much like mov-
ies are rated—by a board of professionals who evaluate it based on crite-
ria such as violence, sexual content, drug use, and depictions of criminal 
activity. Table 6.1 summarizes the rating system. In addition to blocking 
games by rating, you can fine-tune the controls by blocking games based 
on certain types of content. For example, you could block all games that 
contain references to drugs and alcohol but permit games that include 
crude humor and gambling references.
Table 6-1 Entertainment Software Ratings
Rating
Description
Early Childhood
Content that may be suitable for ages 3 and older. Titles in this category contain no material 
that parents would find inappropriate.
Everyone
Content that may be suitable for persons ages 6 and older. Titles in this category may contain 
minimal violence, some comic mischief, and/or mild language.
Everyone 10+
Content that may be suitable for ages 10 and older. Titles in this category may contain more car-
toon, fantasy, or mild violence, mild language, and/or minimal suggestive themes.
Teen
Content that may be suitable for persons ages 13 and older. Titles in this category may contain 
violent content, mild and/or strong language.
Mature
Content that may be suitable for persons ages 17 and older. Titles in this category may contain 
mature sexual themes, more intense violence, and/or strong language.
Adults Only
Content suitable only for adults. Titles in this category may include graphic depictions of sex 
and/or violence. Adult Only products are not intended for persons under the age of 18.
You can also allow or block any specific programs that are installed on your 
computer, even if they are not games and not rated. For example, you can 
block access to all the web browser applications on your computer, effec-
tively preventing that user from using the web. You could also use this 
feature to block users from using software that produces certain output 
that you don’t want that user to be able to create, such as a CD or DVD 
burning application.

Part II: Software
File and Folder Permissions
Using passwords on all the user accounts on your computer ensures that 
no unauthorized persons will be able to access your computer and view 
your personal data. However, it does not provide much privacy between 
users on the same computer. Administrator user accounts can browse 
the documents, music, videos, and other personal files in every other 
user’s libraries. (Standard user accounts cannot.) In addition, if you store 
personal files in any other location besides your own libraries, such as in a 
new folder you create on the hard drive, all other users will be able to see 
and change whatever you put there.
To solve this privacy problem, Windows enables you to restrict permissions 
to do certain things to your folders and files, such as read them and modify 
them. You can set up these permissions on the Security tab in the Properties 
box for the folder or file. (Right-click the folder or file and choose 
Properties to display that dialog box.) This feature works only on drives 
that use the NTFS file system (the default for hard drives in Windows), so 
they won’t work on writeable CDs or DVDs or on USB flash drives.
NOTE
Do not confuse the Security tab with the Sharing tab in the Properties box. The Sharing tab is for network file 
sharing, not local file sharing.
CAUTION
You can set permissions for files or folders, but many experts recommend that you set permissions only for 
folders, and then place the files into a folder that has the permissions you want the file to have. That way if 
you want to change the permissions for a group of files later, you can move them to a different folder with dif-
ferent permissions rather than having to change the permissions on each file individually.
On the Security tab of the 
folder’s Properties box, you see 
group and usernames at the 
top. The Group or usernames 
list shows the current users or 
groups that have permission to 
access this resource. Figure 6.2, 
for example, shows three items: 
SYSTEM, the user Faithe (on 
your system it will show your 
own username here instead), 
and the Administrators group. 
Notice that System and 
Administrators both have an 
icon to their left that shows 
two people’s heads; that icon 
indicates a group rather than 
an individual.
To view the current permis-
sions for a user or group, click 
it on the list. Then in the Permissions area at the bottom of the dialog 
box, examine the permissions that have been assigned. For example, in 
Figure 6.2  The Security tab for a folder named 
Camera.

189
Chapter 6: Windows 7 Administration and Maintenance
Figure 6.2, the Administrators group has been selected, and you can see 
that the group has Allow permissions in every category of operation.
Encrypting Folders
For an extra measure of security for especially sensi-
tive files, you might choose to encrypt the folder using 
Encrypting File System (EFS). Encrypting the folder 
scrambles its contents for storage on disk; the operating 
system holds the key that is able to decrypt the folder 
whenever an authorized user accesses it. Encryption 
makes it more difficult for someone to snoop in a folder 
using a third-party utility designed to bypass the normal 
folder permissions in Windows. To turn on encryption for a 
folder, right-click the folder and choose Properties. On the 
General tab, click the Advanced button. In the Advanced 
Attributes dialog box, mark the Encrypt Contents to Secure 
Data check box. If this option appears dimmed, the folder 
cannot be encrypted for some reason. For example, per-
haps the version of Windows 7 you have does not allow 
encryption. (None of the Home or Starter editions do.)
When encryption is turned on the encrypted files and 
folders appear in green text in Windows explorer. When you move or copy data out of the folder, or when you move 
or copy the folder itself, the encryption is removed. Encryption does not prevent files from being moved, copied, 
or deleted; it only prevents them from being viewed. Therefore, encryption should be used in combination with the 
permissions you are learning about in this section.
Bitlocker is another data security feature in Windows 7. It is available only in the Ultimate and Enterprise editions 
of Windows 7. It encrypts the entire hard drive to prevent it from being read if it is physically removed from the 
computer in which it is installed. This prevents thieves from removing a hard drive from a computer in one location 
and taking it to another location where they can try to access its data. You can enable Bitlocker from the Control 
Panel. Before you do, though, balance the added security benefits against the difficulty you would have transferring 
your hard drive’s contents to a new PC if your existing PC became inoperable. Bitlocker should not be used on a 
system where important data is not backed up frequently and regularly.
Privacy and Security
To change the permissions 
for a user or group, or to 
add or remove a user or 
group from the list, click the 
Edit button. A Permissions 
dialog box opens, in which 
you can add and remove 
users, and you can mark and 
clear Allow and Deny check 
boxes for each permission, 
as shown in Figure 6.3.

Enterprise editions only) that encrypts the entire

to decrypt it.

190
Part II: Software
CAUTION
Some experts recommend that you do not use the Deny check boxes at all. If you want to remove a permis-
sion, clear the Allow check box for that permission. It has the same effect. Using a combination of Allow and 
Deny permissions makes it more complicated to troubleshoot permission problems, especially when subfold-
ers and files inherit permissions from their parent folders.
You can add other individual users or other groups to the Permissions 
list. To do so, click Add in the Permissions dialog box (Figure 6.3) to 
display the Select Users or Groups dialog box. From there, enter the user 
or group name in the text box provided, and then click Check Names to 
make sure that is a valid user or group. Some valid entries include:
◾	 An individual account’s user name
◾	 Everyone (to share with the Everyone group, which all accounts 
automatically belong to)
◾	 Administrators (to share with the Administrators group, which all 
Administrator accounts automatically belong to)
Figure 6.4 shows 
both an individual 
user name (Duncan) 
and the Everyone 
group being added. 
Notice that when 
there are multiple 
entries, they are 
separated by semi-
colons. After adding 
users or groups to 
the list, use the Allow check boxes in the Permissions dialog box to fine-
tune which permissions that group will get.
Figure 6.4  Add more users or groups to the Permissions list.
NOTE
What happens if a user is part of a group that has different permissions assigned? It depends on whether 
you are using Allow or Deny. If either the individual user or the group has an Allow permission, the user will 
have that permission. However, if either the individual user or the group has a Deny permission, the user will 
be denied. If there is a mix of permissions a Deny will always override any Allow permission.

Using System Utilities
Just as you don’t have to be a mechanic to drive a car, you don’t have to 
be a computer technician to use a PC. But just as everyone who drives a 
vehicle should be aware of its basic maintenance requirements, Windows 
users should understand how to assess and improve the computer’s 
condition. In the following sections, you will learn how to use several 
utilities that can provide information about your system and check for 
any problems.
Getting Information about Your Computer
You can get information about your computer in Windows 7 in several 
ways. The most appropriate method depends on the information you are 
seeking.
To see the Windows version and edition, the processor, and the amount 
of RAM, use the System window, as shown in Figure 6.5. To open this 
window quickly, click Start and then right-click Computer and choose 
Properties. This window also contains the computer’s network name, the 
workgroup to which it belongs, and the version of Windows 7 installed. 
These are all basic facts that a service technician might ask you when 
helping you diagnose a problem.
Figure 6.5  The System screen shows basic facts about your computer.

193
Chapter 6: Windows 7 Administration and Maintenance
From the System screen shown in Figure 6.5, you can click the Windows 
Experience Index hyperlink to open the screen shown in Figure 6.6. 
The Windows Experience Index is a numeric rating of your computer 
hardware’s capabilities to run Windows applications well. The scale goes 
from 1 to 7.9, with higher numbers being better. The overall score is 
the lowest of the five sub-scores. In Figure 6.6, for example, the lowest 
score is the primary hard disk, 5.9. When deciding whether or not your 
computer would benefit from a hardware upgrade, these numbers can 
help you decide which component to upgrade first. Looking at the scores 
in Figure 6.6, a new hard disk with a faster transfer rate would raise the 
score, but overall these scores are very good, so upgrading this system 
would probably not result in much performance increase.
Figure 6.6  The Windows Experience Index evaluates your hardware.
If you need more detailed information about your computer, you can 
view the Performance Information and Tools report. To access it from 
the Windows Experience Index page shown in Figure 6.6, click the View 
and Print Detailed Performance and System Information hyperlink. 
Figure 6.7 shows an example of the report. You can click the Print This 
Page button at the top to print it on your default printer.
Even more information is available via the System Information util-
ity. Access it from the Start menu. (The easiest way is to open the Start 
menu and type System, and then click the System Information utility.) 
Click a category on the left (click the plus signs [+] to expand categories 
as needed) and view information on the right. See Figure 6.8.

The Device Manager utility enables you to work with the drivers that 
control the PC’s hardware devices. For example, you can update device 
drivers, disable devices, remove and reinstall devices, and see what system 
resources a device is using. You can access it from the Start menu or 
from the Control Panel (under System). Device Manager is also use-
ful for identifying the exact model number of a device and its current 
driver revision number and date. You might need that information

when searching online for an updated driver for the device. To open 
the Properties dialog box for a device from Device Manager, double-
click it. Figure 6.9 shows the properties for a network adapter in Device 
Manager, with the Driver tab displayed, reporting, among other facts, 
the device’s driver provider, date, and version.

Step by Step
Displaying Basic System Information and the Windows Experience Score
To see your system’s Windows Experience score, follow these steps:
	 1.	Click the Start button to open the Start menu.
	 2.	Right-click Computer and choose Properties. See Figure 6.5.
	 3.	Click Window Experience Index. Information appears about the system’s performance. See Figure 6.6.
	 4.	(Optional) Click View and print detailed performance and system information, as shown in Figure 6.7.
	 5.	Close the open windows.
Browsing the System Information Utility
Use this procedure to review information about various system components:
	 1.	Click the Start button, and type system.
	 2.	When System Information appears at the top of the menu, click it. The System Information window opens, as 
shown in Figure 6.8.
	 3.	Click a + (plus) sign on the left to expand that category.
	 4.	Click a category on the left to display its information on the right.
	 5.	Close the open windows.

196
Part II: Software
Checking for Disk Errors
Disk errors are not common anymore because today’s hard drives are 
much more reliable than their predecessors, but errors do occur. Disk 
errors can cause Windows to crash or lock up, applications to stop work-
ing, and data files to be unreadable. When an error repeatedly occurs 
when you run a certain program or open a certain data file, checking the 
disk for errors may help solve the problem.
There are two kinds of disk errors: physical and logical. A physical error 
occurs when there is an unreadable spot on the hard disk surface. If data 
is stored in that spot, some of the data may be lost. Windows may be 
able to read the data from that spot by repeatedly querying the disk for 
the information if the drive is having only sporadic problems; if Windows 
is able to read the data, it relocates it to another spot on the hard disk, 
which solves the problem.
A logical error occurs when the drive’s table of contents, called the 
Master File Table (MFT), has an inconsistency in it. There are two cop-
ies of the MFT, and if the two copies don’t agree, a logical error occurs. 
Logical errors also occur when the MFT expects to find data for a certain 
file in a certain location and it’s not there, or when two different files 
claim the same physical spot as a part of them, or when data exists in 
a spot but no file claims it. You do not need to be able to differentiate 
between the types of errors, because Windows searches for them all auto-
matically, correcting the problems where possible.
physical error A hard drive error caused by a 
physically unreadable spot on the disk.
logical error A hard drive error caused by an 
inconsistency between the drive’s actual content 
and the Master File Table.
Master File Table (MFT) The internal table of 
contents for a hard drive.
Using Device Manager to View a Device’s Details
Follow these steps to check the properties of a device:
	 1.	Click the Start button, and type device.
	 2.	When Device Manager appears near the top of the menu, click it. Device Manager opens.
	 3.	Click the arrow sign beside a category to expand it.
	 4.	Double-click a device to see its properties, as shown in Figure 6.9.
	 5.	Click the tabs of the Properties dialog box to browse more properties of the device.
	 6.	Click OK to close the device’s Properties dialog box.
	 7.	Close the open windows.
CAUTION
Once a hard disk drive begins developing physical errors, it is unreliable. Even if Windows is able to recover 
the file from a bad spot, more bad spots are likely to appear. The drive should be replaced soon, and essen-
tial information should not be stored on it anymore unless the data is backed up elsewhere.
The Check Disk utility in Windows scans for and repairs disk errors. 
By default, it scans only for logical errors because they are much more 
common. To check for physical errors, you must enable the Scan for and 
Attempt Recovery of Bad Sectors feature. Doing so makes the Check 
Disk operation take much longer (up to several hours), so do not use 
that option for routine checks where there are no known problems.
Check Disk A Windows utility that checks for 
disk errors and corrects them if possible.

Chapter 6: Windows 7 Administration and Maintenance
Defragmenting a Hard Disk
A disk drive’s storage system is organized by sectors, which are 512 bytes 
each, or by clusters (also called allocation units), which are groups of sec-
tors. The cluster size depends on the file system (for example, Windows 
7’s file system for hard drives is NTFS) and the drive capacity. The default 
cluster size for most modern hard disk drives on a Windows system is 
4,096 bytes (4 KB).
When a file is stored on disk, it is placed in the next available cluster. If a 
file is larger than the cluster size, it occupies multiple clusters. Typically 
when a file is written to the disk, it is stored in adjacent clusters. When a 
file’s clusters are all adjacent, it is known as contiguous. 
When a file is modified, it may increase in size so that it requires more 
clusters. There might not be clusters available that are adjacent to the orig-
inal clusters for that file, so the new parts of the file are written to clusters 
somewhere else on the disk. The MFT keeps track of where the clusters 
are stored, and when the operating system asks for the file, the drive’s 
read/write head moves to the different locations to pick up the data and 
assembles it into a whole file. A file that is stored non-contiguously is 
fragmented. Fragmented files work just fine, but the drive accesses them 
slightly more slowly because of the time required for the read/write head 
to move to the different locations.
Defragmenting  relocates files so that they are once again stored in con-
tiguous clusters. Defragmenting can slightly improve the speed at which 
the disk drive retrieves files.
sector The smallest addressable unit of storage 
on a disk drive, at 512 bytes.
cluster A grouping of sectors. The number of 
sectors in a cluster depends on the file system 
and the disk size.
contiguous Physically adjacent to one another.
fragmented A file whose clusters are not 
contiguous.
defragment To relocate a fragmented file on a 
disk so that its clusters are contiguous.
Step by Step
Checking a Disk for Errors
To check a disk for errors, follow these steps:
	 1.	Click the Start button and click Computer.
	 2.	Right-click the hard drive and choose Properties.
	 3.	Click the Tools tab.
	 4.	Click the Check Now button. The Check Disk dialog box opens.
	 5.	(Optional) To scan for physical errors, mark the Scan for and Attempt 
Recovery of Bad Sectors check box.
	 6.	Click Start. Check Disk starts.
	 7.	If a message appears that Windows can’t check the disk while it’s 
in use, click the Schedule Disk Check button, and then restart the 
computer to run the check.
	 8.	When the check is completed, review the results and click OK to 
close the dialog box.
NOTE
Fragmentation is not an issue on solid state drives (SSDs) because there are no moving parts, and therefore 
no performance gain to be attained by files being stored contiguously.

Part II: Software
Working with Printers
In most cases, the best way to add a printer is to run the Setup software 
that came on CD or DVD with the printer. However, there may be times 
when doing so is not possible. For example, perhaps you don’t have the 
disc, or perhaps the printer is connected in a way that Windows can’t 
automatically detect (such as a parallel port interface or certain types of 
network connections). In such cases, you can use the Add Printer Wizard 
to connect Windows to the printer and install a driver for it.
Step by Step
Defragmenting a Hard Disk Drive
Use this procedure to defragment a hard disk drive:
	 1.	Click the Start button and click Computer.
	 2.	Right-click the hard drive and choose Properties.
	 3.	Click the Tools tab.
	 4.	Click the Defragment Now button. The Disk Defragmenter dialog box opens.
	 5.	Click the main hard disk drive on the list and click Analyze Disk. Then wait for a report to appear. It should take 
only a few minutes. The progress is shown in the Progress column.
	 6.	If the fragmentation is more than 5%, the drive may benefit from defragmenting. To defragment it, click the 
Defragment Disk button. Otherwise, click Close to exit the utility without defragmenting.
	 7.	If you chose to defragment in Step 6, wait for the utility to finish. It may take several hours. You can continue to 
use your computer while it works.
	 8.	When the defragmentation process is complete, close the Disk Defragmenter window.

199
Chapter 6: Windows 7 Administration and Maintenance
A driver is a program that serves as a communicator between Windows 
and a device. So many devices are created by different companies that 
Windows can’t maintain information about all the different languages 
they speak, so driver files are used to bridge the gap. When installing a 
printer in Windows, you are not literally installing the printer, but rather 
you are installing a driver for it. You can have multiple drivers for a single 
physical printer, each with its own settings.
After a printer has been installed, it appears in the Devices and Printers 
window. From there, you can do any of the following:
◾	 To see detailed information about the printer, double-click the 
printer’s icon. Depending on the printer, a screen may appear with 
information or the printer’s queue may open. If you see the infor-

driver A software interface between a device and 
the operating system.
Installing a New Printer
Most printers use the USB interface, which is Plug and Play, so Windows detects them automatically and in many 
cases is able to install a usable driver from the set of drivers the printer comes with. However, allowing Windows 
to set up a printer automatically like that is not always the best method. Some printers come with a full-featured 
software suite that is installed when you run the setup CD that came with the printer, and if you let Windows 
detect the printer and install a driver for it, only the most basic driver is typically installed. It may be better to run 
the setup software that comes with the printer before connecting the printer to the computer.
Put It to Work
NOTE
Besides the Printer Properties command on the shortcut menu, there is also a Properties command; selecting 
it opens a different dialog box with a different set of properties for the printer. Experiment with both, if you like.
Step by Step
Adding a Printer
To add a printer to your system, follow these steps:
	 1.	Click the Start button and click Devices and Printers. The Devices and Printers dialog box opens.
	 2.	Click Add Printer.
	 3.	If the printer is connected to your computer with a cable, click Add a Local Printer. If it is connected wirelessly or 
through a network, click Add a Network, Wireless, or Bluetooth Printer.
	 4.	Wait for your printer to be detected and appear on a list. Then click Next.

Troubleshooting Common  
Windows Problems
Windows 7 operates trouble free most of the time, but sometimes a 
problem may occur with some software or with a device driver, and you 
may experience one or more of these problems:
◾	 Windows might not start up correctly.
◾	 Windows might run very sluggishly, taking a long time to open and 
close windows.
◾	 Error messages might appear.
◾	 An application might stop responding to commands.
The following sections explain how to troubleshoot some of these 
problems.
	 5.	Change the printer’s default name if desired, and then click Next.
	 6.	If you don’t want this printer to be the default, clear the Set as the Default Printer check box.
	 7.	(Optional) Click the Print a Test Page button. It is always wise to print a test page to ensure the installation is suc-
cessful and the correct driver is installed.

Chapter 6: Windows 7 Administration and Maintenance
Troubleshooting Start-up and 
Performance Problems
Problems with Windows’ configuration may cause Windows to not be 
able to start normally at all, or they may cause performance problems 
such as slow performance and frequent error messages. The fixes are the 
same for both.
If Windows fails to start normally, a prompt may appear, asking if you 
want to get start-up troubleshooting help. If you choose to use this 
utility (recommended), the utility can diagnose and repair most start-up 
problems without any help, and can access the System Restore utility to 
return the system to an earlier state, before the problem began.
If Windows can’t start normally and you don’t see a prompt offering 
troubleshooting help, you may see a message that Windows failed to 
start normally, asking whether you want to start in Safe Mode. Safe 
Mode is a special operating mode with no non-essential drivers or pro-
grams loaded. After booting into Safe Mode, you can troubleshoot the 
problem by removing any recently installed software or using the System 
Restore utility.
If Windows doesn’t offer to help you enter Safe Mode, you can do so 
manually by using the following procedure.
Safe Mode A Windows start-up mode in which 
non-essential drivers and services are not loaded, 
used for troubleshooting.
Step by Step
Starting Windows in Safe Mode
Follow these steps to start your computer in Safe Mode:
	 1.	Restart the computer. As it begins booting, press F8 at one-second intervals until the Advanced Boot Options 
menu appears.
	 2.	Press the down-arrow key to highlight Safe Mode with Networking and press Enter.
	 3.	Wait for the PC to boot into Safe Mode. It may take several minutes.
Once you are in Safe Mode, you can try to fix the root cause of the 
problem. Think about what you did right before the problem started, 
and then do one of the following:
◾	 If you recently updated a device driver, roll back the update.
◾	 If you think a program loading automatically at start-up is causing 
the problem, disable that program from starting.
◾	 If you are not sure what caused the problem, restore the system to 
an earlier restore point.
See the following sections to learn how to do each of those activities.
Roll Back a Driver Update
If problems occur with a device, sometimes the problem can be solved by 
installing an updated device driver. This file usually comes with its own 
setup program that you download from the manufacturer, and it installs 

202
Part II: Software
itself with a few clicks. However, if there is a problem with the new 
driver, the device could stop working entirely or could cause Windows to 
not start up correctly or run sluggishly.
NOTE
If you stick with signed drivers, you will seldom have problems with a driver that require a rollback. Unsigned 
drivers are more likely to cause the hardware to malfunction or to cause system problems.
signed drivers Drivers that are certified to work 
with certain versions of Windows and certain 
hardware models.
To return to a previous driver if the new one is causing problems, you 
use the Roll Back Driver feature. You can access this feature from Device 
Manager, as explained in the following steps.
Step by Step
Rolling Back a Driver Update
Use this procedure to roll back a driver update:
	 1.	Click the Start button and type device. Click Device Manager when it appears near the top of the Start menu.
	 2.	If needed, expand the category of the device. Then double-click the device to open its Properties box.
	 3.	Click the Driver tab.
	 4.	Click the Roll Back Driver button.
	 5.	Follow the prompts that appear to roll back the driver.
	 6.	Close all open windows.
Disabling a Start-up Program
Some programs load automatically when Windows starts. Sometimes this 
is very useful. For example, antivirus software should load at start-up so 
it can protect the system. However, not all the programs that load auto-
matically are important. For example, some applications load a utility at 
start-up to check the company’s web server for updates.
If a program that loads at start-up malfunctions, or uses a lot of memory, 
Windows performance can be negatively affected. If your system starts 
running more slowly after you install some new software that loads at 
start-up, you may be able to restore normal system performance by 
preventing that program from loading at start-up. You can still run the 
program manually whenever you need it.
First, try looking in the program itself to see if there is a setting that con-
trols the program’s start-up. If there is, turn that setting off. The pro-
gram will then make the needed change to the system files automatically.
If that doesn’t work, you can use the System Configuration utility to dis-
able that program’s automatic start-up. This utility lists all the programs 
that load at start-up, with check boxes next to the names; you can clear 
the check boxes for any programs you don’t want to load.

203
Chapter 6: Windows 7 Administration and Maintenance
NOTE
The System Configuration utility does not always make it obvious what program a certain line represents. If 
you are not sure about a start-up item, do a web search on its name.
Step by Step
Preventing a Program from Loading at Start-up
Follow these steps to prevent loading a specific program at start-up.
	 1.	Click Start, and then type msconfig in the Search field and press Enter.
	 2.	Click the Startup tab.
	 3.	Clear the check box of the entry you want to prevent from loading at start-up.
	 4.	Click OK.
	 5.	Restart the computer to see if the problem is fixed.
Restoring System Files to an Earlier State
If you aren’t sure what the problem is that is causing your system to not 
boot normally or to run sluggishly, System Restore may be able to help. 
System Restore automatically saves a copy of your system files every day. 
If a problem occurs, you can roll back the system files to a previously 
saved version that was created before the problem started. In many cases, 
doing so fixes the problem.
Step by Step
Using System Restore
To return your system to an earlier version using System Restore, follow these steps:
	 1.	Click Start, and then type restore. When System Restore appears at the top of the menu, click it. System 
Restore opens.
	 2.	Click the Next button.

Shutting Down an Unresponsive Program
Sometimes a program stops responding to commands. It may appear as 
if it has a white film over it, and an error message may appear, letting 
you know the program is not responding and offering to close it. If you 
see such a message, click Close the Program. You will lose any unsaved 
changes to data files you have made in that program.
If you don’t see that message, you might need to manually shut down 
the unresponsive program. To do so, use the Task Manager, a utility 
that shows all the running applications and their underlying processes.
Task Manager A utility that shows the running 
applications and their processes and allows you to 
shut down unresponsive applications.
	 3.	Select the desired restore point. In most cases, the latest one is the best to use, but you might go back further if 
the problem started before the latest point.
	 4.	Click Next.
	 5.	Click Finish.
	 6.	Wait for the computer to reboot. When it does, the restore will have taken place.

Using Help and Support
Windows 7 has an extensive Help and Support database built in, with 
instructions for almost every task you might want to complete in 
Windows. You can access it from the Start menu by clicking Help and 
Support. You can also get context-sensitive help by pressing F1.
In the Windows Help and Support window, shown in Figure 6.10, you 
can type a keyword in the Search box to find related topics, or you can 
click Browse Help Topics (or click the Browse Help button at the top of 
the window) to browse the Help system by category. You can return to 
the home page of the Windows Help and Support window at any time 
by clicking the Home icon at the top of the window.
If you don’t find the answer you seek in the Help and Support system, 
you can click the Ask button at the top of the window to view the More 
Support Options page. From here you can access a variety of online 
resources, including these:
◾	 Windows Remote Assistance: You can use this feature to send an

Summary
Managing User Accounts
To use Windows, you must log in using a user account. A Standard account can run programs 
and make simple customization changes that don’t affect other users. An Administrator account 
can make any changes to Windows, including those that affect other users. Standard accounts are 
recommended for daily use because they pose fewer security risks. The Guest account is a limited 
account with no password; it is disabled by default.
User accounts may optionally have passwords assigned to them to prevent unauthorized use. A 
strong password is one that is difficult to guess; it may contain a combination of letters, numbers, 
and symbols.
Parental controls allow adults to limit the computer usage of children. Parental controls can 
include time limits, game restrictions, and application restrictions.
You can prevent other users from looking at your personal files by changing the permissions for 
the folders they are in. On a per-user basis, you can set an Allow or Deny property for various 
activities, such as reading the file and changing its content.
Using System Utilities
Some of the utilities that can provide information about your system include the System section 
of the Control Panel, the Windows Experience Index, the System Information utility, and the 
Device Manager.
Disk errors can be either physical errors or logical errors. A logical error occurs when the 
Master File Table (MFT) does not match the disk’s actual contents. A physical error is a bad spot 
on the disk surface. The Check Disk utility can find and fix both types.
Disks are organized by groups of sectors called clusters. When a file is stored in contiguous clus-
ters, the drive can read it faster than when the clusters are fragmented. The Disk Defragmenter 
utility relocates files into contiguous clusters, defragmenting the drive and improving its 
performance.
A printer driver helps Windows communicate with a printer. You can install a printer driver from 
the software that comes with the printer or with the Add Printer Wizard.
Troubleshooting Common Windows Problems
When Windows can’t start normally, it can sometimes be started up using Safe Mode. After start-
ing in Safe Mode, you can solve problems by rolling back drivers, disabling start-up programs, or 
restoring System Restore points.
To shut down an unresponsive program, right-click the taskbar and choose Task Manager. Select 
the program and click End Task.
To get help in Windows 7, click Help and Support on the Start menu or press the F1 key.

Balancing Security with Ease of Use
Each security measure you put in place has its drawbacks. For example, if you put a password on

that contains drivers that amateur programmers have created and made available. When you try 
to install one of them, a warning message states that it has not passed Windows 7 compatibility 
testing, and asks if you want to continue anyway. What would you do from here? Explain your

As you learned in Chapter 1, “Computer Basics,” software is a broad term for any 
program that runs on a computer. This can include the operating system and all its 
helper files, utilities that keep the computer healthy and running well, and applica-
tions. Another name for software is a program.
Application software is software that enables you to perform a useful task on your 
computer. Some programs are classified as productivity software because they allow 
you to get things done. Other application software is designed to entertain you, or 
to help you learn something.
Business Productivity Software
Businesspeople typically use a collection of applications known as an office suite 
to perform the most common tasks involved in their jobs, such as writing reports 
and correspondence, calculating numbers, giving presentations, and maintaining 
databases of information. You will learn about each of those tools in more detail in

Understanding Word Processing 
and Desktop Publishing
The most popular type of productivity software is the word processor. 
This type of program is used to create text-based documents. A word 
processor contains many features designed to help improve text, such 
as spell-checking, grammar correction, and formatting tools. In fact, 
Microsoft Word is the world’s most widely used word processor and one 
of the most advanced examples of this type of program.
In addition to creating and editing your own work, you can also open 
word-processing documents that other people have created. Word 
can open and save documents in a variety of formats, enabling you to 
exchange documents with people who use other word-processing applica-
tions. You will learn how to save and open files in Word and other Office 
applications in Chapter 8, “Understanding Microsoft Office 2010.”
A word-processing program provides a wide variety of text formatting 
options. For example, you can make the text larger, change its color, 
or use different fonts. You can structure the page to emphasize impor-
tant elements by using a larger type size. You can specify how the text 
is arranged, so that all the words start at the far left or far right of the 
page in a neat vertical arrangement. Figure 7.1 shows a document in 
Microsoft Word that includes several types of formatting, including shad-
ing, different fonts, and multiple columns. You will learn much more 
about Microsoft Word in the next two chapters.

213
Chapter 7: Understanding Application Software
For a detailed look at how to format a complete document and add images 
and charts, see Chapter 9, “Word Processing with Microsoft Word.”
For even more control over page layout, you can use a desktop publish-
ing program, sometimes called page layout software. Some popular desk-
top publishing programs include Microsoft Publisher for casual home 
users and QuarkXPress and Adobe InDesign for professionals.
Desktop publishing software enables users to precisely position the text 
and other elements on a page or across a double-page spread (facing 
pages) to create an attractive design. The text can be creatively wrapped 
around embedded images, and graphics can be made transparent, or 
“ghosted,” behind text so the words aren’t obscured.
The main difference operationally between word processing and desk-
top publishing is that a word-processing program typically enables you 
to type directly on the page onscreen, and it flows the text automati-
cally based on the margins, indents, and number of columns you specify. 
Desktop publishing, on the other hand, uses movable and resizable 
frames for everything, including text (see Figure 7.2). This gives you 
more control over the precise positioning of each element.

Understanding Spreadsheets
A spreadsheet program is used to analyze and present numeric data. 
For example, you might use a spreadsheet to create a budget, summa-
rize sales data, or compare mortgages. Figure 7.3 shows a sales sum-
mary report with a chart created in Microsoft Excel, the most popular 
spreadsheet program available today. You will learn more about Excel in 
Chapter 10, “Creating Spreadsheets with Microsoft Excel.”
spreadsheet A program that presents rows and 
columns of figures and other items against which 
time and other variables can be plotted.
Careers in IT
Administrative Assistant
An administrative assistant provides office and document support to a manager or executive. He or she is 
expected to know how to use a word processor to create and format documents. The templates supplied with 
word-processing software make the formatting and spell-checking processes much easier, but an administra-
tive assistant should be familiar with how they work and be capable of producing neatly formatted reports with 
charts and graphs. An administrative assistant’s duties may also include creating printed materials in other 
applications, such as Excel and PowerPoint, and combining content from multiple applications into reports and 
presentations.
All administrative support roles require a solid understanding of office productivity programs and strong organi-
zational skills. A diploma in administration, information technology, or business management is also expected. 
A business administration or IT degree plus vocational courses will help progress your career into office 
management.
Figure 7.3  Use spreadsheets to record everyday expenses and make simple calculations.

215
Chapter 7: Understanding Application Software
Spreadsheet data is entered into cells in rows and columns. You can enter 
text, numbers, or a combination of the two. If you enter numbers, you 
can apply number formatting that makes the numbers appear as currency, 
percentages, or any of several other number types.
Spreadsheet software does more than just record lists of text and data, 
however. It also supports formulas that calculate and manipulate the 
numeric data. For example, in Figure 7.4, each of the expense figures 
in column B is summed in the formula in cell B9: =SUM(B3:B7). See 
Chapter 10 for detailed information on creating spreadsheets and work-
ing with formulas.
Figure 7.4  A formula is used in cell B9 to sum  
the values in cells B3 through B7.
Spreadsheets can produce a range of charts and graphs based on the data 
they contain, like the one shown in Figure 7.3. These charts can then be 
exported and used in a report such as a word processing document or a 
presentation.
cell The intersection of a row and a column in a 
worksheet.
formula A mathematical calculation to be per-
formed in an Excel cell. It may refer to other cells 
for its values.
Data Analyst
Accountants, tax advisors, business owners, and managers all depend on spreadsheets for their work. However, 
as with word-processing skills, it’s likely you’ll need to use spreadsheets in almost any type of job. The ability to 
“crunch numbers” comes in useful for analysis, planning, and forecasting, too.
Spreadsheets are incredibly useful when working with a large amount of data. A data analyst must have the ability 
to categorize and process large volumes of information and draw meaningful conclusions from them. Databases 
and spreadsheets are both used to process and draw out information.
Data analysts may have a degree in statistics, mathematics, or business, but they also need an in-depth knowledge 
of spreadsheets in order to work with such large amounts of information and variables.

Part II: Software
Understanding Databases
A database is a structured collection of data, such as the inventory of a 
store or a collection of personnel files. A database contains one or more 
tables, each of which contains records. For example, you might have 
a table called Employees that contains a record for each employee. A 
record is information about one instance of the data being stored, such 
as one employee, one inventory item, or one sales transaction. Each 
record contains one or more individual pieces of information, called a 
field. For example, in an Employees table, one of the fields might be 
Badge Number, and another might be Hire Date. The software used 
to create and control a database is a database management system 
(DBMS). For small, simple databases, many people use Microsoft 
Access, which is covered in Chapter 11, “Managing Databases with 
Access.” For large-scale databases, a company might use an enterprise-
level database system like Oracle.
A database program makes calculations and extrapolates information 
using combinations of data and varying instruction sets. You might use it 
to see how one item or person compares to another. For example, your 
school uses a database to keep track of how well you’re doing in com-
parison to your classmates across different subjects. Extracting informa-
tion from a database is known as data mining. Web searches make use of 
data mining to provide search results based on the search query the user 
enters.
The most common type of database is called a relational database. 
In a relational database, there are multiple tables that have relation-
ships to one another. For example, in a sales database, there might be a 
Customers table, an Orders table, and an Order Details table. Because 
an individual customer can have multiple orders, and an individual order 
can contain multiple items, the details about the customer are stored 
separately from the details about the order, and the order line items are 
stored separately from both. Figure 7.5 shows these tables and their rela-
tionships in Microsoft Access. Using related tables allows a salesperson 
to pull up the customer’s shipping and payment information whenever 
he or she starts a new order, rather than having to reenter it each time. 
Microsoft Access, which you will learn how to use in Chapter 11, creates 
relational databases.
A hierarchical type of database has a tree structure in which elements 
consist of nodes. The database starts from a single point, known as the 
parent node. The database branches out and has multiple levels. Items 
on a branch are known as child nodes. There may be one or several child 
nodes. A hierarchical database works by narrowing down a search start-
ing with the entire set of records and successively excluding any that the

Personal Information Management 
Software
It can be a challenge to keep track of where you need to be, what you 
need to do, and whom you need to contact. Personal information 
management (PIM) software helps people stay organized by providing 
a calendar, an address book, and a to-do list. Some PIM software also 
functions as an email program, and allows you to send, receive, store, 
and organize email messages.
How an Online Store Uses Databases
When you buy something online, the online store uses an application program to manage the purchase process 
that will connect to the database to check stock levels. When you arrive at the site and log in, the application will 
look for you in the customer database and check that your password and email address match the details for 
your account. When you add an item into your shopping cart, a database query is run to check the stock levels 
and, if applicable, the application places the requested item in your cart and instructs the database stock level to 
decrease by one. When you click Checkout to go the payment page, the site will ask you to confirm or revise your 
payment details and then issue a request to your bank for the funds. Assuming the request is accepted, the online 
shopping application will confirm your purchase and send you an electronic receipt before issuing an instruction to 
the warehouse to send out your goods.

Part II: Software
Microsoft Outlook is a very popular email application that includes a 
full set of PIM capabilities. You can also get some of the individual PIM 
functions in other applications. For example, you can buy separate calen-
dar, task list, and email applications, or use free versions online, such as 
Google Calendar and Gmail.
Software Suites
Some software manufacturers, such as Microsoft, offer multiple related 
products that are designed to work well together. They are sometimes 
sold together as a suite, which is a collection of related applications. The 
Microsoft Office suite is a very popular suite of business applications; 
you will learn more about it in Chapters 8 through 12. It includes Word, 
Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, plus some extra applications in some 
versions such as Access and Publisher. All the applications in the Office 
suite have similar user interfaces and can exchange content freely. You 
can buy each application separately, but it is much less expensive to buy 
the suite.
Adobe also makes a well-known set of professional graphics and 
publishing tools, Creative Suite. In Creative Suite, the Photoshop, 
Dreamweaver, Illustrator, InDesign, and Director programs provide 
photo-editing, web design, vector graphics, desktop publishing, and 
video-editing capabilities. Each program in Creative Suite supports the 
proprietary file formats of the other programs, so a Photoshop file can 
be imported into Illustrator, where further elements can be added before 
the file is again opened for final edits to be completed in Photoshop.
Accounting and Personal Finance Software
Whether you are doing the accounting for a small business or just keep-
ing track of your own personal bank account, there is software available 
that can help you. Accounting software simplifies the entire process of 
managing a business’s finances, including creating invoices and purchase 
orders, processing payments, and running reports. QuickBooks is one 
of the most popular accounting applications for small businesses; larger 
businesses may use their own proprietary accounting software. An online 
version is also available on a pay-as-you-go monthly fee plan. Other 
accounting programs include FreshBooks and Outright, both of which 
are web-based.
If you are looking to track your own personal finances, you might want 
to consider a program such as Quicken, the most popular personal 
finance software. It can not only manage your bank accounts, but also 
your investments and loans. Microsoft also has a free online tool called 
Mint that can perform many of the same functions, and your bank may 
have its own web-based interface that you can use for free.
If you live in a country where you have to file a yearly income tax state-
ment, you may want to get help from tax software. TurboTax and H&R 
Block are two popular tax applications, each of which comes in various 
versions for different levels of tax filing complexity. This software can 
help you print the forms you need to mail, or in some cases to file the 
required forms electronically for you online.
suite A group of applications by the same manu-
facturer purchased as a group.

Graphics Software
Graphics software includes any application that enables you to create 
and manipulate visual images. This broad category includes drawing pro-
grams, photo manipulation programs, presentation creation programs, 
and video capture and editing software. The products available include 
both professional-quality software used in entertainment and advertising, 
and consumer-quality software that the average computer hobbyist might 
experiment with.
graphics software Software that enables you 
to create and manipulate visual images.
NOTE
Desktop publishing software, which you learned about earlier in this chapter, can straddle the line between 
text and graphics software because it enables you to combine text and graphics to produce page layouts.
Vector Image Drawing Programs
There are two main categories of graphic images: vector and raster. 
Although they may look similar, they are structured quite differently and 
require entirely different types of software to create them.
A vector-based illustration is created with math formulas, like in 
geometry class. A rectangle, an oval, a straight line—they all have a 
math formula that plots them on a two-dimensional grid. A three-
dimensional vector graphic, such as a 3D representation of a cube or 
sphere, plots the image in a three-dimensional grid space. (The software 
does all the math, so you don’t have to worry about that part—you 
just draw by dragging your mouse to create the lines and shapes you 
want.) Professional-quality programs such as Adobe Illustrator create 
very sophisticated vector graphics for commercial uses, such as techni-
cal drawings and architectural plans. At a much simpler level, Microsoft 
Office products like PowerPoint, Word, and Excel all come with basic 
vector drawing tools you can use in their data files. Vector graphics also 
figure prominently into many video games.
Vector images have many advantages. They do not take up much disk 
space to store because the information needed to display them is very 
simple and compact. They can also be resized to any size without any 
loss of quality, because the math formulas behind them are simply 
recalculated and the shape redrawn. The main disadvantage of a vector 
graphic is that even the best quality drawings don’t look completely real. 
Most people would never mistake a character from a game like “Second 
Life” or “The Sims” for a video of a real person, for example.

constructed of mathematically created lines.

	 9.	Close PowerPoint without saving your changes.
Raster (Photo) Editing Programs
A raster graphic, also called a bitmap image, is one that’s composed of 
a grid of colored pixels. When you use a scanner or digital camera to 
capture an image or take a photo, the result is a raster graphic. Raster 
graphics can also be created from scratch using a program such as Paint 
(the free raster image-editing program that comes with Windows) or, 
on the higher end, Adobe Photoshop (or the consumer-level version, 
Photoshop Elements, shown in Figure 7.6).
A raster graphic has a native size, known as its resolution. Resolution is 
measured in number of pixels horizontally by number of pixels vertically, 
like this: 1024 × 768. This is the same way monitor screen resolution 
is measured, as you may remember from Chapter 3, “Input, Output, 
and Storage.” The higher the resolution, the better the picture will look 
when printed at a large size.
A raster image also has a color depth, which means the number of bits 
required to describe each pixel’s color. A standard color depth is 24-bit, 
which uses 8 bits for red, 8 bits for green, and 8 bits for blue. There 
are 224 (that is, 2 to the 24th power, or about 16 million) unique colors 
possible in 24-bit color. The human eye can only detect about 10 million 
different colors, so this is more than enough for full photorealism.
raster graphic A graphic that consists of a grid 
of colored pixels that collectively form an image.
pixel An individual colored dot in a raster graphic 
or on a display screen.
resolution The number of pixels that comprise 
an image horizontally and vertically.
color depth The number of bits needed to 
describe the color of each pixel in a certain 
display mode, such as 16-bit or 32-bit.

222
Part II: Software
Figure 7.6  Photoshop Elements, a simpler version of the popular Adobe Photoshop, can be used to create and edit raster graphics.
One disadvantage of raster graphics is that they take up a lot of disk 
space. Each pixel requires 24 bits to describe it, at a minimum, so 
a 1024 × 768 image would take up at least 2,359,296 bytes (about 
2.3 MB) in an uncompressed file—maybe more, depending on the file 
format. Because raster images can be so large, some file formats employ 
compression.
Depending on the file format, compression can either be lossless (no loss 
of image quality) or lossy (some loss of image quality).
The other major problem with raster graphics is that they tend to lose 
their quality when resized—especially when enlarged beyond their origi-
nal dimensions. This happens because when you enlarge a raster image, 
the pixels don’t change size, so the software must simulate a particular 
pixel’s color, taking up more space than it originally did. The trouble is, 
it’s not nearly as simple as just adding another pixel of the same color 
next to the original, because resizing is often done in odd multiples, like 
15%. Therefore, the image-editing software must do its best to simulate 
the enlargement by doubling some pixels but not others, and the result is 
a jagged or fuzzy image. In Figure 7.7, for example, see how this image, 
originally with crisp lines, becomes pixilated (that is, you can see the jag-
ged edges of individual pixels) when it’s enlarged.
compression The process of reducing the size 
of a data file by encoding information using fewer 
bits than the original file.

Presentation Graphics Software
At various points in your working life, you’re likely to be asked to give a 
presentation or make a speech. It’s a daunting prospect. However, you 
can deflect some of the attention by giving your audience something 
else to look at. They will also find it easier to digest what you have to 
say if you provide a visual representation of key facts and figures you’re 
discussing. Presentation graphics software is the ideal tool for this pur-
pose. It enables you to create screen-sized slides containing a mixture of 
words and images that you can move through on demand as you deliver 
your presentation. You can incorporate audio and video clips, corporate 
branding such as company logos and color schemes, and other special 
elements and features. (See Figure 7.8.)
Figure 7.8  A PowerPoint presentation is used to summarize the speaker’s information.
presentation graphics software A program 
that combines charts, graphics, and bulleted lists 
of information as a series of slides that sum-
marize a report or verbal presentation. Microsoft 
PowerPoint is the most widely used program.
slide A screen of information that is displayed 
in a static fashion while a presenter elaborates 
on its contents. Often, the slide will be part of an 
electronic presentation file and the presenter can 
move through successive files on demand.

226
Part II: Software
Most presentations are created and delivered using the Microsoft 
PowerPoint part of the Microsoft Office productivity suite. On an Apple 
computer, the equivalent program is Keynote; there is also a version of 
Microsoft Office available for Apple devices such as Macs and iPads.
Presentation graphics generally distill what the speaker says into bulleted 
summaries, and bar and pie charts. Such presentations may accompany 
a detailed report or be used as part of a marketing pitch—for example, 
showing why a company is better to do business with than its rivals. The 
most effective presentations have only a handful of slides and feature 
minimal details, allowing the audience to focus on what the presenter 
says. To make your point effectively, avoid creating long and boring pre-
sentations crammed with far too much information.
For a look at how to create and present a PowerPoint presentation, see 
Chapter 12, “Creating Presentation Graphics with PowerPoint.”
Computer-Aided Design Software
Computer-aided design (CAD) software is used when designing any 
sort of item that has a physical form (rather than being flat like a photo). 
It uses the same basic idea as the two-dimensional vector graphics that 
you learned about earlier in this chapter, but it models them to have 
height, width, and depth. This is also known as 3D modeling.
Three-dimensional drawings are built around a wireframe. This is a sort 
of skeleton on which details of the computerized object or character are 
overlaid. The wireframe is created by extruding the flat shape to give it 
volume and depth.
The object is also given mass and assigned textures and properties such 
as skin, hair, bones, or fabric. Each of these elements has a predefined 
(but separately editable) set of attributes. For instance, the attributes 
of a brick wall would include strength, inflexibility, and resistance to 
wind and people bumping into it. The wireframe can be rotated so 
the designer can check that all the design elements and perspective are 
correct.
Once all the attributes have been added to an object created using a 
CAD program, the object is rendered to give it the appearance of a solid 
form by applying surface texture and color. For example, in Figure 7.9, 
which shows a rendered image in AutoCAD, notice how the image sur-
face of the handheld vacuum includes two different surface textures: One 
looks like solid plastic, and the other looks semi-transparent.
Rendering can require huge amounts of computer power. Especially 
detailed designs can take many hours to render. If you want to design in 
3D, you will need a powerful desktop computer with a multi-core CPU, 
lots of memory, and a high-quality graphics card.
computer-aided design The process of using 
computer software to produce technical drawings 
that include the product’s precise scale, simulate 
its textures, and show it in full three-dimensional 
detail.

only of drawn lines, without any surface textures

Computer-Aided Designer
Many creative industries depend on computers for their work. The computer games and film industries make 
extensive use of 3D design. Almost every new product that’s created is prototyped using CAD software, too. A CAD 
designer needs strong technical drawing and creative graphics skills.
Developments in CAD software and a new type of printer have made it possible to prototype objects much more 
cheaply. A 3D printer uses plastic rather than ink to lay down layer upon layer in order to build up three-dimensional 
objects. Consequently, there is a greater demand for people who can produce the designs for the objects that will 
be printed in 3D. 3D printers such as the Makerbot Replicator 2X (pictured) are being used in classrooms and by 
hobbyists to create 3D models.

Other Types of Software
Besides the big categories of software we’ve looked at so far in this 
chapter, there are many smaller categories, such as lifestyle and hobby 
programs, and educational software. The following sections only scratch 
the surface of what’s available; you will want to explore the many types 
of applications available on your own.
Music and Video Players
If you have a Windows computer, you’ll find that Windows Media Player 
can play music you’ve downloaded and any music CDs you insert. It 
will also play some video clips and movies. As an alternative to Windows 
Media Player, you might use iTunes, which is a free download from 
Apple’s website (see Figure 7.10). iTunes can play music, videos, pod-
casts, audio books, and more. You can also use online services, such as 
Pandora, to listen to music.
Figure 7.10  iTunes is one example of an application that can play music and video clips.
Your computer may come with a DVD movie player application, or you 
might choose to buy one, such as RealPlayer Plus, WinX, or CyberLink 
PowerDVD. This software provides an interface you can use to watch 
movies on DVD and Blu-ray discs (provided, of course, you have an 
appropriate disc drive).

229
Chapter 7: Understanding Application Software
Audio and Video Editing Software
If you want to create your own videos and music, you’ll need a camera 
and instruments to do so. You can easily capture video and record audio 
on a smartphone and then transfer them to your computer for editing.
Many applications are available for editing audio tracks. For example, the 
freeware program Audacity (audacity.sourceforge.net) lets you 
import multiple audio tracks, trim out the parts you don’t require, and 
then splice everything together. Mac users can record and mix digital 
piano, guitar, and drum tracks in the excellent GarageBand application. 
You can also buy more full-featured products, such as Adobe Audition.
Windows Live Essentials (windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/­
windows-live/essentials) contains a free Windows Movie Maker 
program that you can use to trim and combine video clips and photos and 
to add a sound track or commentary (see Figure 7.11). On a Mac, iMovie 
offers slick tools to quickly create your own mini movie. Neither of these 
programs will tax your computer’s processor, but if you want to create 
professional-looking movies you’ll need to use a dedicated video-editing 
program such as Sony Vegas Pro or Adobe Director. As with the animation 
and 3D graphics programs described earlier, you need a powerful computer; 
a quad-core or eight-core processor and powerful graphics card are essential.
Figure 7.11  You can use a free video editor such as Windows Movie Maker to make video 
clips from your photos.
Can’t Play DVDs?
If Windows Media Player won’t play DVDs, it may be because you are missing a codec. A codec is a translation file; codec 
is short for coder/decoder. Different file formats require different codecs, and not all versions of Windows 7 come with 
the one you need to play DVD movies. (If you have Windows 7 Home Premium, Ultimate, or Enterprise, you should have 
it already.) You can choose to buy and install the needed codec (see http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/
windows/windows-media-player-plug-ins), but before you do that, see whether there is some other application 
installed on your PC that will play DVD movies. Most PCs that come with a DVD drive also come with such software.
codec A translation file used to play back a 
certain audio or video format. An abbreviation of 
coder/decoder.

Education Software
Just about anything that you want to accomplish, you can find software 
to help you do it. For example, you can buy legal software that will help 
you draw up basic legal documents that are valid in your location, such as 
a will, a power of attorney statement, a lease, and a loan agreement.
You can also improve your life by using reference software, such as dic-
tionary and encyclopedia programs. These are mostly found online these 
days because it is easier to keep them current that way; you might choose 
to use free resources or to pay for a subscription to an online encyclope-
dia with premium content.
legal software Software that guides the user in 
creating legally binding contracts and forms.
reference software Software that provides 
access to established facts and information on a 
variety of topics.
NOTE
With so many free online reference sources today, why would someone want a reference tool such as an 
online encyclopedia with premium content? One important reason is that a commercial source of reference 
materials offers more accuracy and higher quality because they can afford to pay full-time fact-checkers and 
professional writers. Online sources that are collaboratively maintained, such as Wikipedia, do not provide any 
assurance of accuracy, and the writing quality varies a great deal among entries.
Educational software can teach new skills and expand your knowledge 
on a variety of subjects. When you think of educational software, you 
might at first think of software designed for children, but there are many 
adult education programs too, such as Rosetta Stone for learning new 
languages (see Figure 7.12). Many colleges and universities offer online 
courses that have their own proprietary learning interfaces, including 
video lectures, interactive tutorials, and text and graphical lessons.

Do you know someone who would like to be better educated but doesn’t have the money to spend on higher educa-
tion? Direct her to Open Yale, a service of Yale University, at http://oyc.yale.edu. To quote from its website: 
“Open Yale offers free and open access to a selection of introductory courses taught by distinguished teachers and 
scholars at Yale University. The aim of the project is to expand access to educational materials for all who wish to 
learn. All lectures were recorded in the Yale College classroom and are available in video, audio, and text transcript 
formats. Registration is not required.” This program does not issue any credit, degree, or certificate.

Communication Software
Communication software provides various ways of communicating with 
other people, usually via the Internet.
An email application helps you send and receive email messages. You 
might choose a stand-alone application like Eudora, a combination email 
and PIM application like Outlook, or an online web-based service like 
Outlook.com or Gmail.
Most operating systems come with a web browser application, but you 
can also download and install others, most of them for free. Popular 
browsers include Internet Explorer (which comes with Windows), 
Google Chrome (which comes with the Chrome OS), Safari (which 
comes with Mac OS X and iOS), Opera, and Firefox. Figure 7.13 shows 
the Google Chrome browser.
email application Software that assists in 
sending and receiving email.

Part II: Software
Figure 7.13  Versions of the Chrome browser are available for a variety of operating systems.
Free instant messaging applications such as Yahoo! IM and AOL 
Instant Messenger enable you to have text conversations with your 
friends and family from your computer desktop. Some of these pro-
grams also have some video chat capabilities. Services such as Skype are 
designed specifically for video chat; they enable you to have person-to-
person video chats with other people, provided you both have webcams 
and microphones on your computers.
Businesses use videoconferencing programs to hold meetings involving 
multiple people at multiple locations. These programs are the full-­
featured business version of video chat; they not only allow you to see 
and hear other participants, but also allow you to share computer screens, 
collaborate on documents in real-time, draw on a virtual whiteboard, and 
more. A company that does a lot of remote conferencing may have its 
own server with its own conferencing software.
Groupware helps people who are working on projects together to keep 
in touch. Users can post shared files that can be collaboratively edited, 
exchange messages, hold online meetings, and more in this environment. 
Microsoft SharePoint is one example of groupware software.
Web Authoring Software
Want to create your own website? There are many ways to do it. You can 
code your own files in a plain text editor like Notepad and then check 
your work in a browser, but most people (including most professionals) 
use web authoring software that provides a what-you-see-is-what-
you-get (WYSIWYG, pronounced wizzy-wig) interface. Using this 
software, you don’t have to constantly switch back and forth between 
your code and a browser window to see what you’re doing. One popular

Managing Your Applications
In the following sections, you’ll learn some important information 
that will help you choose the right software and manage your software 
collection.
Software License Agreements
Most software that you install is subject to copyright. This means that its 
design and content belong to somebody else and that person or organi-
zation has laid down rules governing how the program may be used. In 
order to install the software, you must agree to respect this copyright and 
to abide by the terms of use. The terms of use are also known as an End 
User License Agreement (EULA). Before you install the program, you 
are given the opportunity to read through the terms of this agreement in 
case there is anything you object to or there are any rights that you don’t 
want to agree to.
To learn about the different licenses that apply to different types of soft-
ware, refer to the section “Software Licensing” in Chapter 17, “Legal, 
Ethical, Health, and Environmental Issues in Computing.”
Application System Requirements
Before you purchase an application, you should check its system require-
ments. The system requirements represent the minimum hardware 
configuration required in order to successfully install and run the applica-
tion. You can find the system requirements printed on the software box 
if you buy it at a retail store; if you buy it online, you can find them on 
the application’s website. System requirements usually include a mini-
mum CPU speed, a minimum amount of RAM, and certain standards 
for sound and video support. They may also specify Internet access, a 
particular type of input device (such as a joystick), and a certain amount 
of free hard drive space. Figure 7.14 shows the system requirements for 
the World of Warcraft video game under Windows, for example. It is 
common for the system requirements for games to be more restrictive 
than for business applications because of the intense graphic processing 
needed for games that have complex motion graphics. As you can see in 
Figure 7.13, this application has two sets of specs: one for the minimum 
requirements, and one that is recommended for best performance.
End User License Agreement (EULA) The 
legal agreement between the owner of an applica-
tion and the user who wants to install and use it
system requirements The minimum hardware 
required to install and run an application.

Installing and Removing Applications
Installing an application is easy. To install an application that came on 
CD or DVD, simply insert the disc into your computer. The Setup util-
ity should run automatically. If it does not, browse the content of the 
drive and double-click the Setup.exe file. To install an application that 
you downloaded, double-click the downloaded file after it has finished 
downloading.
To remove an application in Windows 7, you use the Control Panel, as 
described in the following steps.
Step by Step
Uninstalling a Windows Application
Follow these steps to uninstall an application in Windows 7: 
	 1.	Click Start, and click Control Panel.
	 2.	Under the Programs heading, click Uninstall or Change a Program.
	 3.	Click the program to uninstall on the list of programs that appears.
	 4.	In the bar at the top of the list, click Uninstall.
	 5.	Follow the prompts that appear to uninstall the application. They will vary depending on the application.
	 6.	If prompted to restart the computer after the uninstall has completed, click Yes to do so.

235
Chapter 7: Understanding Application Software
Updating Applications
Application developers frequently release free updates to their prod-
ucts. These updates may add new features, fix problems, or both. Some 
updates even patch security holes that make your computer vulnerable 
to online attack. It is almost always a good idea to install any available 
updates right away.
Some applications are set up to automatically notify you when an update 
is available. The notification may pop up in a dialog box, or as a balloon 
near the notification area. Click in the message that appears, and follow 
the prompts. Some Microsoft products, such as Microsoft Office, update 
themselves automatically as needed through Windows Update.
Other applications must be checked manually for updates. For example, 
some applications have a Check for Updates command on the Help 
menu, as in Figure 7.15. Select the command to allow the program to 
check its home website for updates. Then follow the prompts that appear 
if an update is available. You might have to go to the website manually to 
look for updates.

Summary
Business Productivity Software
A word processor is used to create text-based documents. Desktop publishing software provides 
more control over page layout than a word processor. A spreadsheet is a grid used to analyze and 
present numeric data in cells. Spreadsheets use formulas to perform calculations.
A database is a structured collection of data. The data resides in tables, each of which contains 
records and fields. An application that creates databases is a database management system. Data 
mining is the process of extracting useful information from a database. The most common type 
of database is a relational database, which has multiple tables with relationships between them; 
another type is a hierarchical database, which uses a tree structure made up of nodes.
A suite is a group of related applications, such as the applications in Microsoft Office. There are 
other suites too, such as Adobe Creative Suite.
Accounting software helps small businesses maintain their financial records. Personal finance 
software helps individuals and families do the same. Tax software helps individuals and businesses 
file their tax forms.
Graphics Software
Graphics software is software that enables you to create and manipulate visual images. Vector 
graphics are lines and shapes drawn mathematically, like in geometry. Vector graphics are small 
and easily resizable but not realistic.
Raster graphics, or bitmaps, are composed of a grid of colored pixels. They are large and don’t 
resize well but can be photorealistic. A raster graphic’s size is its resolution (number of pixels 
horizontally and vertically). It has a color depth, which is the number of bits required to describe 
each pixel’s color. Some file formats support image transparency, image animation, and/or 
compression. When a raster image is resized, it may become pixelated.
Presentation graphics software enables you to create slides to use as visual aids in presentations.
Computer-aided design (CAD) software is used to design 3D objects using vector-based draw-
ings. An object drawing starts out as a wireframe and then is rendered by having surface textures 
and colors applied to it.
Other Types of Software
Music applications such as iTunes can plan and manage not only music but also videos, podcasts, 
and audio books. DVD player software can play movies from DVD discs on your computer. For 
Windows Media Player to play DVDs, you must have a supported version of Windows or purchase 
a codec. To edit your own audio and video files, a variety of free and low-cost programs are avail-
able, as well as higher-end professional tools.
Legal software helps people draw up basic legal documents that are valid in their location. 
Reference software provides a collection of information, such as a dictionary or an encyclope-
dia. Educational software can teach new skills and expand your knowledge through lessons and 
tutorials.

238
Part II: Software
Communication software includes email applications, instant messaging, and video chat. 
Professional-quality video chat for groups is called video conferencing. Groupware is software 
that helps people work together as a team from remote locations.
Web authoring software helps people create web pages and sites. Some are simple text editors, but 
most are what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG), for easier viewing of the edits.
Managing Your Applications
Software is licensed in different ways. Most applications are commercial software, owned and dis-
tributed by someone who wants to make a profit on them. Shareware allows you to try it first and 
then pay only if you keep it. Freeware is totally free. With public domain software, the owner 
gives up the copyright. When the author makes the source code available, it is called open-source 
software. The End User License Agreement (EULA) spells out the terms of the license.
Software piracy means stealing software by using it without abiding by the license agreement. To 
prevent this, some programs require a product key to install them, and require activation to lock 
that product key to a particular computer. Companies that buy multiple copies of an application 
may choose to buy a site license.
The system requirements of an application explain the minimum hardware configuration 
required to run the application successfully. It may include specs for CPU, memory, graphics, and 
hard drive space.
To install an application, insert its CD/DVD or run its Setup file. To remove an application, use 
the Uninstall a Program feature in the Control Panel in Windows.
Some applications update themselves automatically; with others, you must locate and run a Check 
for Updates command in the software interface or visit the manufacturer’s website to see if updates 
are available.

Making Older Software Work in Windows 7
Applications originally written to run under earlier versions of Windows may not always per-
form well under Windows 7. One work-around is to set up Compatibility Mode for an applica-
tion. Compatibility Mode can simulate any of several earlier Windows versions when interacting 
with that application. Using the Help and Support in Windows 7, look up information about 
Compatibility Mode to learn how it works and how to enable it.
With your instructor’s permission, download a shareware or freeware game from www.­download.
com, where the system requirements do not include Windows 7, and install it on your computer. 
As you are locating a game to download, look at the system requirements for the game to find out 
the highest Windows version it supports. Then configure Compatibility Mode to emulate that ver-
sion. Try the game to make sure it works with these settings. When you are finished, uninstall the 
game.
Other Software Types
There are many other software types besides the ones presented in this chapter. Using the Internet 
to help provide ideas, make a list of at least seven types of software that weren’t covered in this 
chapter, and write a brief description of each type, including who might use it and what they 
might use it for. If you can’t think of seven types, look at a website that sells software, such as 
Amazon.com, for ideas.
Think It Over
Paying for Application Software
Some types of software application cost hundreds of dollars, while other programs can be used for 
free. What are the advantages and disadvantages of paying for software? How do you think makers 
of free software make any money? What pricing model would you use if you were writing a pro-
gram, and how would you make money from it? How would you provide customer support and 
make sure improvements to the program were made?
Sharing Software and Games
License agreements mean you aren’t supposed to lend your friends the games you own. Do you 
think there is anything wrong with letting your friends make copies of the programs and games 
you’ve bought? Would you consider getting free copies of games you know normally cost money 
by downloading them from the Internet? Can you see any dangers or issues with doing so?

◽	 Identify the basic parts of an Office application’s interface
◽	 Use common features that all Office applications share
◽	 Save, open, and create data files
◽	 Print your work and email it to others
◽	 Adjust the options of an Office application
Microsoft Office is the most popular suite of business applications in the world. Its 
core products—Word, Excel, and PowerPoint—are considered the standard tools 
in millions of offices. In many companies, newly hired business professionals and 
support staff are expected to come into their positions already knowing how to use 
these tools.
Upcoming chapters in this book cover the individual applications. However, 
because Microsoft Office is a suite, the applications share many common features. 
You will learn about the common features in this chapter, including using the 
interface, managing the application window, saving and opening files, creating new 
files, and distributing your work to others. These will be important skills to have 
already mastered when you get to later chapters.

Understanding the Office 
2010 Interface
Each Office 2010 application has the same basic controls, so once you 
have mastered one application, learning another application is easy.
The heart of each Office application’s controls is a thick toolbar across 
the top called the Ribbon. The Ribbon has multiple tabs; click a tab to 
display a different set of controls. The Home tab is displayed by default 
when you open the application. Each tab of the Ribbon is organized 
into groups. A group is a named section; the group names appear at the 
bottom of each group. Some groups have a dialog box launcher in the 
lower-right corner. Clicking this button opens a dialog box or task pane 
with more extensive options than are shown on the Ribbon itself.
Some tabs are common to all applications, such as Home, Insert, and 
View; others are unique to a particular application, such as the Mailings 
tab in Word and the Formulas tab in Excel. Figure 8.1 shows the 
Ribbons in Word 2010 and Excel 2010.
To the left of the regular tabs is a File tab, which opens Backstage view. 
Within Backstage view, you can select a command for saving, opening, or 
closing a file, or click a category and then select commands on the right. 
The commands change depending on which category you choose. For 
example, in Figure 8.2, the Save & Send category has been selected.
Ribbon The main toolbar in Office applications 
and some other Windows applications, consisting 
of multiple tabbed pages of commands.
tab A tabbed page of a Ribbon, or the name of a 
particular tabbed page.
group A named section of a Ribbon tab.
dialog box launcher An icon in the lower-right 
corner of a group on the Ribbon; when clicked, it 
opens a dialog box or task pane.
Backstage view The area of an Office applica-
tion where you select commands that affect the 
entire active document or the application itself. 
Access it by clicking the File tab on the Ribbon.
Careers in IT
Microsoft Office Specialist
After you have mastered the Microsoft Office 
products, you may want to pursue Microsoft Office 
Specialist certification. Candidates take a series of 
tests that show their mastery of the applications, 
and after passing the exams, earn a certificate. 
Potential employers will see this certification as 
proof that you can use Office applications produc-
tively to tackle whatever tasks are given to you.
There are three levels of certification. You can 
earn a Microsoft Office Specialist certification 
in each application. For Expert level certi-
fi-
cation, you must pass the Expert level exams for 
Word and Excel. For Master level, you must pass 
the Expert level exams for Word and Excel plus 
the basic level exam for PowerPoint and one other 
basic level exam of your choice (Outlook, Access, 
or SharePoint). See http://www.microsoft.
com/­learning/en-us/mos-certification.aspx to learn about the certification program.

TIP
To temporarily hide the Ribbon for more workspace onscreen, click the up-
pointing arrow to the right of the Ribbon’s tab names. The Ribbon will appear 
only when you click a tab name. To restore the Ribbon to being always on, 
click the down-pointing arrow (which replaced the up-pointing arrow you 
clicked earlier).
Above the Ribbon, on the left end of the title bar, is the Quick Access 
Toolbar (QAT). You can customize this toolbar by adding and remov-
ing commands from it. This toolbar remains constant no matter which 
tab is displayed, so you can keep your favorite commands close at hand 
on the QAT without having to remember which tab contains them. The 
down-pointing arrow at the right end of the QAT opens a menu of com-
mon commands that you can toggle on and off on the QAT by selecting 
them, as shown in Figure 8.3. You can also choose More Commands 
from that menu to add other commands to it that aren’t on the list.

Chapter 8: Understanding Microsoft Office 2010
When you right-click, a short-
cut menu appears (also called 
a context menu). Its com-
mands depend on what you 
right-clicked. If you right-click 
a selected block of text, for 
example, commands appear that 
will help you format it, move or 
copy it, and check its spelling, 
as shown in Figure 8.4. If you 
right-click on a graphic, com-
mands appear for formatting 
and positioning the graphic. 
The shortcut menu that appears 
when you right-click a button 
on the Ribbon offers an option 
to add that command to the 
Quick Access Toolbar.
When you hover the mouse 
pointer over a button or 
command on the Ribbon, a 
ScreenTip appears, telling you 
its name and purpose. In some cases, ScreenTips also contain keyboard 
shortcut prompts. For example, when you point at the Justify button on 
the Home tab, you find out that Ctrl+J is the keyboard shortcut setting 
that alignment, as shown in Figure 8.5. To use a keyboard shortcut, hold 
down the first key while you tap (press and release) the second key.

when pressed in combination, issue a command.
Ribbon Doesn’t Look Right?
If the Ribbon in an application doesn’t appear to have the same commands on it as your classmates’ comput-
ers, yours may have been customized. To reset the Ribbon, right-click any button on the Ribbon and choose 
Customize the Ribbon. In the lower-right corner of the dialog box that appears, click Reset, and then click Reset All 
Customizations. Then click OK. Your Ribbon will be back to its original state.

TIP
For a list of all the available keyboard shortcuts in an application, open the application’s Help window (F1) 
and search for keyboard shortcuts. The status bar, at the bottom of the application window, provides several 
pieces of status-related information. In a Word document, for example, it tells you how many pages are in the 
document and what page number you are working with at the moment. It also tells you how many words are in 
the document. See Figure 8.6. The exact details the status bar provides depend on the application.

	 2.	 What is Backstage view and what kinds of commands are found there?
	 3.	 How do you display a context-sensitive shortcut menu for an object?
At the right end of the status bar are the Zoom controls. The Zoom 
controls enable you to zoom in and out to view your work at different 
magnifications. You can drag the slider, or you can click the - (minus) 
or + (plus) button on its ends to increment the zoom out (-) or in (+). 
The current zoom level is reported to the left of the Zoom slider; click 
the current Zoom level to open a Zoom dialog box in which you can 
set the zoom level more precisely. You can see the Zoom and View con-
trols in Figure 8.6. The View tab also has Zoom controls that perform 
the same functions (plus a few others).
As with any window, you can adjust an Office application window’s size. 
To resize a window, drag its border, and to move a window, drag its title 
bar. You can maximize it by clicking its Maximize button (in the upper-
right corner of the window), and then 
restore it to pre-maximized size by click-
ing the Restore button, which replaces 
the Maximize button when the window 
is maximized. You can minimize the 
window down to a button on the taskbar 
with the Minimize button, and you can 
close the window (which closes the appli-
cation and any open files) by clicking the 
Close button. Figure 8.7 points out the 
window controls in an Office application’s 
window.

Chapter 8: Understanding Microsoft Office 2010
Using Basic Features of 
Office Applications
Office applications have many commands and features in common. For 
example, the procedures for getting help, changing views, cutting and 
pasting, formatting text, and undoing mistakes are nearly identical. In 
the following sections, you will learn about some features that work the 
same way in each of the main Office applications.
Getting Help
To get help in any Office application, do any of the following:
◾	 Press the F1 key. If you do this while a dialog box is open, the 
help provided is context-sensitive.
◾	 Click the Help button. It’s the question mark in a blue circle 
above the right end of the Ribbon. You can see it in Figure 8.7, 
below the Close button.
◾	 Click the File tab and click Help.
In the Help window that appears, you can search for a particular topic by 
typing a keyword in the Search box, or you can browse the Help ­system 
by clicking on one of the hyperlinks on the home page of the Help 
­system. Figure 8.8 identifies the buttons on the Help window’s toolbar.
Figure 8.8  Use the Help window to look up information about using the active application.

Moving Around
As you create content in an applica-
tion, you might have more content 
than you can see onscreen at once, 
so you might need to scroll to 
view different parts of it. You can 
scroll using the scroll bars with 
your mouse. Figure 8.10 shows a 
scroll bar.
In Excel, the vertical and horizontal 
scroll bars are always available. In 
Word and PowerPoint, the vertical 
scroll bar is always available, but the 
horizontal one only appears if the 
displayed document is wider than 
the screen width.
The size of the scroll box indicates 
how much content you can’t see 
at the moment. For example, in 
Figure 8.10, the scroll box occupies 
about one-third of the scroll bar; 
that means that about one-third of 
the document’s content is currently 
visible. In a very large spreadsheet or 
document, the scroll box might be very small.
scroll To page through the document so that a 
different part of it becomes visible.
scroll bar The horizontal or vertical bar to the 
bottom or right of the document, containing scroll 
arrows and a scroll box, which you can use to 
scroll.
scroll box The box in the scroll bar that you can 
drag to scroll the display. You can also click above 
or below the scroll bar to scroll one screenful at 
a time.
Changing Views
Each application has its own unique set of views that you can switch 
among while working with your data. Different views are useful in 
different situations. For example, in PowerPoint, you use Normal 
view for general slide editing and Slide Sorter view to reorder and 
organize the slides. In Word, you use Print Layout view for most 
editing, but you can switch to Outline view to organize sections of a 
document or Web Layout to see how a document will appear when 
saved as a web page.
To switch views, select the desired view from the View tab on the 
Ribbon. See Figure 8.9. You can also switch to certain views using 
the Views buttons on the status bar (just to the left of the Zoom 
controls).
Figure 8.10  A scroll bar in Micro-
soft Word.
Figure 8.9  Choose an appropriate view for the task at hand from the View tab.

253
Chapter 8: Understanding Microsoft Office 2010
You can also move around using keyboard shortcuts. As you gain 
experience with the applications, you might find using keyboard short-
cuts more convenient than using the scroll bar. For example, press-
ing Ctrl+Home takes you to the beginning of the file in most Office 
applications.
Scrolling the display does not move the insertion point. To move the 
insertion point, click where you want it to go, or use the directional 
arrow keys on your keyboard to move it. In Excel, a thick outline around 
the active cell shows the cell in which content will be entered.
Selecting Content
Most of the commands you issue apply to whatever text or object is 
selected. For example, to italicize text, you first select the text to affect. 
Then when you click the Italics button, only the selected text is affected.
When you select in Excel, you usually want to select entire cells rather 
than individual characters of text. When a cell is selected, any format-
ting or other commands that you issue apply to everything in that cell. 
You can select a contiguous range (all in one rectangular block area) or 
a non-contiguous range (multiple cells are not adjacent to one another). 
To select an object (such as graphic), click it.
insertion point The flashing vertical line that 
indicates where typed text will appear.
TIP
Here are some ways to use a scroll bar:
	 1.	Click the arrow at the end of a scroll bar to scroll the display slowly in the direction of an arrow (a small 
amount each time you click).
	 2.	Drag the box in the scroll bar to scroll quickly.
	 3.	Click in the empty space on the bar to one side or the other of the scroll box to move one screenful at 
a time in that direction.
Step by Step
Selecting Text in Word or PowerPoint
Do any of the following to select text:
◾	 Drag the mouse pointer across it (holding down the left mouse button).
◾	 Click where you want to start and then hold down Shift as you press the arrow keys to extend the selection.
◾	 Click where you want to start and then hold down Shift and click where you want to end the selection.

Using the Office Clipboard
In the section “Moving and Copying Files and Folders” in Chapter 5, 
“Introduction to Windows 7,” you learned about the Windows 
Clipboard. This temporary holding area enables you to cut or copy an 
item from one location and then paste it into another location, effectively 
moving or copying it. The Clipboard can also be used to cut, copy, and 
paste snippets of data from different applications and data files into a 
single file. For example, you can copy a paragraph from Word and paste it 
into an Excel worksheet or PowerPoint slide, or into a different location 
in Word (either in the same document or a different document).
Table 8.1 provides a quick summary of the ways to cut, copy, and paste 
in Office applications.

Clearing the Office Clipboard
If you don’t exit from all Office applications before stepping away from your computer, anyone who sits down at your 
computer can see the items on the Office Clipboard. If you have any concerns about privacy, click the Clear All but-
ton at the top of the Clipboard task pane to remove all items from it after you are finished using the Clipboard.
Microsoft Office has an enhanced version of the Clipboard called the 
Office Clipboard. It uses the Windows Clipboard as its basis, but adds 
the capability to store up to 24 objects at a time. (On the Windows 
Clipboard, when you cut or copy another object, the previously saved 
object is removed from the Clipboard.)
Office Clipboard The enhanced version of the 
Windows Clipboard that appears in Office applica-
tions. It can hold up to 24 items at once.
Selecting Cells in Excel
To select a contiguous range of cells:
◾	 Drag the mouse pointer across the cells (holding down the left mouse button).
◾	 Click the first cell to select it and then hold down Shift as you press the arrow keys to extend the selection.
◾	 Click the first cell to select it and then hold down Shift and click the last cell.
To select a non-contiguous range of cells:
◾	 Click the first cell to select it and then hold down Ctrl and click each individual cell to select.

255
Chapter 8: Understanding Microsoft Office 2010
To display the Office Clip­board’s task pane, 
click the dialog box launcher in the Clip­
board group on the Home tab. Each 
time you cut or copy something to the 
Clipboard from an Office application, it is 
placed on the list in the task pane. If you 
want to paste the most recently cut or cop-
ied item, you can use the standard methods 
of pasting from Table 8.1. However, if you 
want to paste one of the earlier items, dis-
play the Clipboard task pane and then click 
the item you want to paste. Figure 8.11 
shows the Clipboard task pane with several 
items on it. The Office Clipboard is shared 
between all Office applications, so you 
can, for example, copy several cell ranges 
or charts from Excel and have access to 
them in PowerPoint or Word on the Office 
Clipboard.
Using Undo and Redo
If you make a mistake in an Office applica-
tion, you can easily undo your last action 
with the Undo command. You can either 
click it on the Quick Access Toolbar (see 
Figure 8.12) or press Ctrl+Z, its keyboard 
shortcut. You can do this multiple times in 
a row to go back multiple steps.
There’s an easy way to undo multiple 
actions at a time. The Undo button has a 
down arrow to its right; click it for a drop-
down list of recent actions, and then drag 
across the ones you want to undo.
After you have used Undo, a 
Redo button becomes available 
to its right on the QAT. Redo 
undoes the Undo operation. 
You can use Redo as many 
times in a row as you used 
Undo. For example, if you just 
clicked Undo three times to 
undo the last three actions, you can then click Redo three times to redo 
those actions. The shortcut for Redo is Ctrl+Y.
When Redo is not available, its button on the QAT turns into a Repeat 
button, which enables you to repeat the last action you took. If you 
aren’t sure which button is active in that spot (Redo or Repeat), hover 
the mouse over the button and see what name appears in the ScreenTip.
Figure 8.11  The Office Clip-
board task pane enables you to 
store up to 24 items to be pasted.

Text Entry and Formatting
To enter text, click in an area that accepts text, moving the insertion 
point there, and begin typing. In Excel, you type in cells; in PowerPoint, 
you type in object placeholder frames. In Word, you can type text 
directly on the document page. To edit, use the Backspace key to delete 
the character to the left of the insertion point, or use Delete to delete the 
character to its right. You can also select blocks of text, or cells contain-
ing content, and press the Delete key to clear the text. See “Selecting 
Content” earlier in this chapter. In Excel, rather than an insertion point, 
there’s a cell cursor, a thick outline that indicates the active cell.
cell cursor The thick line around the active cell 
in Excel, indicating that this is where typed text 
will appear.
Put It to Work
Click and Type
In Word, when you start a new document, the insertion point is in the upper-left corner of the  
page. What if you want to type something in the center of the page, or at the bottom? One 
method is to press Enter until you get to the desired vertical position. An easier way is to use 
Click and Type. Move the mouse pointer to the spot where you would like to place the insertion 
point, so that the mouse pointer turns into an I-beam with an image of one of the alignment 
buttons next to it (from the Home tab’s Paragraph group). Depending on where on the page horizontally you move, 
the alignment symbol changes to show how the text will be set to align if you click and type in that spot. Click, and 
the insertion point jumps to the spot you clicked, and Word automatically creates the needed paragraph breaks to 
get the insertion point to that spot. This only works in Word, not in Excel or PowerPoint.
All the Office applications have similar controls for text formatting. After 
you select some text, you can use the commands in the Font group on 
the Home tab to change the font, size, and color of text, as well as apply 
attributes like bold, italics, and underlining. Figure 8.13 shows the Font 
group in Word, and points out the buttons that are common to all the 
applications. To find out what the other buttons are in this group, point 
at each one to view the ScreenTip.
Figure 8.13  Use the Font group’s commands to format text.

Chapter 8: Understanding Microsoft Office 2010
Understanding Themes and Color Palettes
Each application enables users to apply themes, which are groups of format-
ting presets. A theme contains definitions of three key formatting aspects: 
fonts, colors, and effects (applied to graphic objects). In some applications, 
a theme may contain additional elements; for example, in PowerPoint, a 
theme may contain a background image that is applied to each slide. You 
can override a theme’s settings in one or more of those areas by applying a 
color theme, font theme, or effect theme (which are like themes but more 
limited, affecting only that one aspect of the formatting).
Each document, workbook, or presentation has a set of 12 color place-
holders: ten colors for standard use, and two colors that define the colors 
for followed and unfollowed hyperlinks. The choice of theme (or color 
theme) dictates what those colors will be.
Commands for selecting colors (such as the Font Color button on the 
Home tab) open a color palette from which you can select a color, like 
the one shown in Figure 8.14.
Figure 8.14  Select a color from a palette of choices.
On this palette, you see the following choices:
◾	 Theme Colors: The top row in this section contains theme colors, 
color swatches for the colors assigned to each placeholder position 
in the theme. Beneath the top row are variants of the theme colors, 
either lighter or darker than the original color by a specified amount. 
When you apply colors from this area, you are not choosing actual 
colors—you are choosing placeholder positions. If you change to a 
different theme or color theme, those colors will change.
theme A named set of formatting presets, gov-
erning font, color, and object effect choices.
color palette A grid of color choices that opens 
when you click a button for a feature that is 
color-related.
theme colors The colors assigned to the color 
placeholders in a theme.

258
Part III: Microsoft Office
◾	 Standard Colors: Standard colors are fixed and are not affected 
by the theme or color theme.
◾	 More Colors: If you want a fixed color but none of the color 
swatches in the Standard Colors section are right, choose More 
Colors to open a Colors dialog box from which you can select a 
color more specifically. On the General tab of this dialog box is a 
larger assortment of swatches. On the Custom tab, you can specify 
a color by number using one of the standard color models.
There may be other choices at the bottom of the palette, depending 
on the object you are applying color to. For example, there may be a 
Gradient option for applying a blend of colors.
Moving and Resizing Objects
Each application includes the capability to insert content in movable and 
resizable frames that either float over the top of the regular content (as 
is the case in Excel) or interact with the text on the underlying page in a 
way you specify (as in Word). In PowerPoint, all content is in frames.
The content within one of these frames is known as an object. An object 
can be a graphic, a chart, a drawing, or any of several other items. A text 
box can also be an object.
To resize an object, drag one of its selection handles. A selection handle is a 
small marker in a corner of the object’s frame or at the midpoint along one 
side of the frame. Depending on the application and the type of object, the 
selection handles may be either white or colored (black, pale blue, or bluish-
green), and may be either round or square. Figure 8.15 shows the selection 
handles around a text box, for example.
standard colors Fixed colors that are not 
affected by the theme in use.
object An item that is separate from the rest of 
the document, with its own movable and resizable 
frame.
selection handles The markers on the border 
of an object that allow the object to be resized.
CAUTION
As you resize an object, its aspect ratio (proportion of height to width) may change. If the object is a graphic, 
the graphic may become distorted. To avoid changing the aspect ratio when resizing an object, hold down the 
Shift key as you drag a corner selection handle. Some object types maintain their aspect ratio automatically 
when you drag a corner selection handle, even if you do not hold down the Shift key.
Figure 8.15  Drag a selection handle to resize an object.

259
Chapter 8: Understanding Microsoft Office 2010
To move an object, drag it with the mouse. You can position the mouse 
pointer over any part of the object and then drag. (Exception: If the 
object is a text box, you must drag it by any part of its border that is not 
near a selection handle.)

Saving, Opening, and Creating Files
Each application has similar procedures for working with data files. You 
can create, save, and open files in much the same way. In the following 
sections, you will learn the basic techniques for these operations.
Saving Files
As you work in an application, the content you create is stored in the 
computer’s memory. This memory is only temporary storage. When you 
exit the application or shut down the computer, whatever is stored in 
memory is flushed away forever—unless you save it.
The steps for saving and opening data files are almost exactly the same in 
each application, so mastering it in one program gives you a head start in 
other programs.
TIP
Ctrl+S is the keyboard shortcut for the Save command; Ctrl+N is the shortcut for the New command (to start 
a new file); and Ctrl+O is the shortcut for the Open command (to open an existing file).
Navigating the file system is the same in the Save and Open dialog boxes 
as it is in Windows Explorer, which you learned to use in Chapter 5, 
“Introduction to Windows 7.” You can move between volumes and 
folders, select favorite locations from the Favorites list, and so on. 
Figure 8.16 points out the navigation controls in the Save As dialog box 
in Word, for example.

260
Part III: Microsoft Office
Figure 8.16  Use the Save As dialog box controls to navigate to different locations.
Step by Step
Saving a File for the First Time
Use these steps the first time you save a new file:
	 1.	Click the File tab and click Save, or click the Save icon on the QAT.
	 2.	In the Save As dialog box, navigate to the desired location, as shown in Figure 8.16.
	 3.	Type the desired filename in the File name box.
	 4.	(Optional) Change the file type if desired.
	 5.	Click Save.
Re-Saving a File Subsequent Times (Same Settings)
Do the following to save a file again using the same settings:
	 1.	Click the File tab.
	 2.	Click Save, or click the Save icon on the QAT. The file is immediately saved with the same settings as before.

261
Chapter 8: Understanding Microsoft Office 2010
Saving to the OneDrive Cloud
If you use Microsoft OneDrive (formerly called SkyDrive) for cloud stor-
age, you can easily save to it directly from any Office application by 
using the OneDrive shortcut in the Favorites list in the Save As or Open 
dialog box. (If you don’t see a OneDrive shortcut there, go to https://
onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/download and download the 
utility for Windows 7 that integrates OneDrive with Windows Explorer.)
Put It to Work
Re-Saving a File Subsequent Times (Different Settings)
Follow these steps to save another copy of an existing file in a different location, or with a different name, or with a dif-
ferent file type:
	 1.	Click the File tab and click Save As.
	 2.	In the Save As dialog box, navigate to the desired location.
	 3.	Type the desired filename in the File name box.
	 4.	(Optional) Change the file type if desired.
	 5.	Click Save.
Understanding Data Formats
Each application has its own data formats, summarized in Table 8.2. 
When you save a file, you can open the File type drop-down list and 
select a file format.
Table 8.2 Office Application File Formats
Application
Native format
Macro-enabled format
Backward-compatible format (97-2003 format)
Word
docx
docm
doc
Excel
xlsx
xlsm
xls
PowerPoint
pptx
pptm
ppt
TIP
When you don’t have a reason to do otherwise, use the native file format for an application (the one where 
the extension ends in “x”). The resulting files are smaller and you ensure that you have access to the full set 
of application features that way. Some program features aren’t supported in backward-compatible file formats, 
and you won’t be able to use them (or save them) in a backward-compatible file.

262
Part III: Microsoft Office
Each application’s native format is the default format in which new 
content is saved. Each application also has a macro-enabled option, for 
files that contain macros. (Most don’t.) Making the general format non-
macro-enabled cuts down on the risk of spreading macro viruses. Each 
application can also save and open files from earlier versions for backward 
compatibility. (Use the format that has 97-2003 in its name.)
Privacy and Security
Password-Protecting Files
You can password-protect an Office application’s 
data file as you save it. To do so, from the Save As 
dialog box, click the Tools button, and then choose 
General Options from the menu. In the dialog box 
that appears, you can assign a password to the file. 
There are two password prompts: Password to Open 
and Password to Modify. The former allows read-only 
access; the user cannot save changes back to the 
same file. The latter enables changes to be saved. 
You can assign two different passwords to allow 
some people one type of access and others the 
other type.
Opening and Closing Files
To open an existing file, click the File tab and click Open, and then make 
your selection in the Open dialog box, after navigating to the location 
where the file is stored. After you have created a file and saved it, you can 
reopen the file to review or edit it.
NOTE
You can also open files when you are not already in an application. In Windows Explorer you can double-click a 
data file to open it in its native application.
If you want to open a recently used file, there’s a quicker method. After 
clicking the File tab, click Recent, and then click the shortcut for one of 
the recently used files that appear on the list, as shown in Figure 8.17.
When you are finished with a file, you can close it by clicking the File tab 
and then clicking Close. Closing a file frees up some of your computer’s 
memory for other uses. When you exit the application, all open files are 
automatically closed, and you are prompted to save any unsaved changes 
to them.

263
Chapter 8: Understanding Microsoft Office 2010
Figure 8.17  Select a file from the Recent list as an alternative to choosing it from the Open dialog box.
Creating New Files Using a Template
In each application, starting the program starts a new blank data file. You 
can start using this data file, or you can start another one using a tem-
plate. A template is a file containing preset settings and, in some cases, 
sample content. Templates serve as shortcuts to creating documents with 
complex formatting, such as newsletters.
Each application has a few templates stored locally on your hard drive. 
Office.com provides hundreds more professional quality templates for 
each application, and you can access them from within each application, 
provided you have an Internet connection. You can also create and save 
your own templates for personal use. For example, you could modify one 
of the downloaded templates and then save a customized version.

matting settings and sometimes sample content.

Starting a New File Based on a Template
Follow these steps to create a new file using a template:
	 1.	Open the application. Click the File tab and click New. Shortcuts appear for various template types. Local 
Microsoft-provided templates are found under Sample Templates in the top section. Online templates are found in 
the Office.com section.
	 2.	Double-click the category you want to open, and navigate to the desired template.
	 3.	Click the template and click Create. If prompts appear, follow the prompts. (Some templates require a download or 
more information.)

Chapter 8: Understanding Microsoft Office 2010
Printing and Sharing Files
Each application has a similar Print function that you can use to gener-
ate hard copies of your work. You can also share your work electronically 
with others by sending it to people via email.
Printing a File
To print a file, first set it up the way you want it in the application, 
including hiding or collapsing any content you don’t want to show, set-
ting font sizes and spacing, and so on. Then click the File tab and click 
Print, and make your selections of the options that appear.
The options are slightly different in each application; Figure 8.18 points 
out some of the common features. You can choose which printer to use, 
the number of copies to print, whether those copies should be collated, 
what page orientation to use, and more.
Figure 8.18  Print from the Print category in Backstage view.

266
Part III: Microsoft Office
In the Pages text box, you can specify certain page numbers to print. To 
print individual pages, separate the numbers by commas, like this: 1, 3, 7. 
To print a range, use a hyphen, like this: 3-6. Other print options may be 
available, depending on the application; click the Print All Pages button 
to open a menu.
The largest portion of the Print screen consists of a Preview pane, on 
which you can see the document exactly as it will be printed. Use the 
arrow buttons below the preview to move between pages. If you don’t 
like the preview, click any other tab to return to normal viewing and fix 
the document as needed before you print.
Step by Step
Printing a File
Follow these steps to print a file:
	 1.	Click the File tab and click Print. Options appear for the print job.
	 2.	Adjust any settings as desired, including choosing a different printer, number of copies, and page range.
	 3.	Click Print.
Sending a File as an Email Attachment
In your email software, you can attach files to your outgoing messages, 
but you can also attach and send files directly from within Office applica-
tions, without opening your email software separately. You can send a file 
in its native format (for example, docx for Word, pptx for PowerPoint, 
and so on), or you can choose to send it in some other format, such as 
PDF. When the recipient gets your attached file, he or she can double-
click it to open it in whatever application is associated with that file type 
on his or her PC.
NOTE
PDF (Portable Document Format) is a page layout format that is platform-independent; people often use it 
to send files to people who may not have the appropriate software to open the file in the application in which 
it was originally created. Sending a file as a PDF also makes it harder for others to make changes to the file, 
so it is useful for sending contracts and other official documents for review. XPS is the Microsoft equivalent of 
PDF. Office 2010 applications can save and send in either PDF or XPS.
Step by Step
Sending a File via Email
Follow these steps to send a file as an email attachment:
	 1.	With the file open in its Office application, click the File tab and click Save & Send.
	 2.	In the center pane, click Send Using Email.
	 3.	In the right pane, click the appropriate button to indicate the way you want the file sent. To send it in its native 
format, choose Send as Attachment.

	 2.	 How can you send a file to someone else as an email attachment?
	
4.	Follow the prompts to complete the send operation. The exact steps from this point depend on what format you 
chose in Step 3.
Setting Application Options
Each Office application contains a similar Options dialog box, in which 
you can make some choices about how the application operates. Some 
options are unique to the specific application; others are the same (or 
similar) across all applications. In the following sections, you will learn 
about some of the options you can set.
To access the Options dialog box, click the File tab, and then click 
Options. Then click a category in the navigation bar at the left to see a 
certain page of options.

268
Part III: Microsoft Office
General Options
On the General options page are settings that control a few very basic 
things about the way Office appears:
◾	 Show Mini Toolbar on selection: When this is enabled and you 
select some text and then point at the selection with the mouse or 
right-click the selection, a mini toolbar pops up containing some 
common formatting buttons for easy access.
◾	 Enable Live Preview: When this is enabled, certain menus and 
galleries that contain formatting choices are “live,” in that when 
you point at an option on the menu, you see it previewed in the 
document behind the open menu.
◾	 Color scheme: The default is Silver, but you can choose Blue or 
Black if you prefer. This setting governs the color of certain areas of 
the Ribbon and interface.
◾	 User name: Put your name here so that the application can fill in 
your name when it uses a Name placeholder in certain templates.
◾	 Initials: Put your initials here so the application can use your 
initials in certain features, such as identifying who made a certain 
comment.
Proofing Options
Proofing options enable you to define how the spelling checker and 
related features work, such as AutoCorrect. AutoCorrect enables you to 
set up corrections for words that you commonly misspell, and contains a 
preset list of many common misspellings to get you started. For example, 
it can automatically correct thier to their. To access the AutoCorrect set-
tings, click the AutoCorrect button on this page.
For the other options, mark or clear the check boxes, as shown in 
Figure 8.19. For example, you can control whether or not the spelling 
checker ignores uppercase words (which can help you avoid having acro-
nyms marked as misspellings). Word has more proofing options available 
than PowerPoint or Excel does.
Save Options
Save options, shown in Figure 8.20, define how the application saves 
files. You can choose whether to let it save AutoRecover information, 
for example, and at what intervals. AutoRecover automatically saves 
your work in progress in a temporary file; when you issue the Save com-
mand or exit the application, that temporary file is automatically deleted. 
However, if the program terminates abnormally, the temporary file per-
sists, and you can use it to recover unsaved work.
AutoCorrect A feature that automatically cor-
rects certain spelling errors.
AutoRecover A feature that automatically saves 
your work at specified intervals so you can recover 
it if the application terminates before you are able 
to save normally.

269
Chapter 8: Understanding Microsoft Office 2010
Figure 8.19  Proofing options define how the application’s spelling check and 
­AutoCorrect work.
Figure 8.20  Save options define how Save operations work.

270
Part III: Microsoft Office
Another commonly changed option is to set a different default file for-
mat, in the Save Files in This Format drop-down list. For example, if you 
exchange files with someone who uses Office 2003, you will want to set 
each application to the 97-2003 file format for backward compatibility.
You can also specify a location (in path format) for the AutoRecover file 
location, as well as the default file location. The default file location is 
the default folder that appears in the Save As and Open dialog boxes the 
first time you open them in a work session. After the first time, the previ-
ously shown location appears, until you exit and restart the application, 
at which point the location is reset back to the default.
You can also choose whether or not to embed fonts in the file when 
saving. Doing so makes the file larger than it would be otherwise, but it 
ensures that whoever opens it on another computer sees the presentation 
exactly as intended, even if that computer has different fonts installed.

Summary
Understanding the Office 2010 Interface
The Ribbon is the large, multi-tabbed toolbar at the top of each Office application window. It 
contains tabs (pages) of commands. Commands are organized in groups on each tab. A dialog 
box launcher, found in some groups, opens a dialog box related to that group.
When you click the File tab, Backstage view opens, which contains multiple categories in a 
navigation bar along the left side. Click a category to see a page of options relating to file manage-
ment. The Quick Access Toolbar (QAT) is the small, customizable toolbar that appears above 
the Ribbon. When you right-click, a context-sensitive shortcut menu appears, from which you 
can select commands relating to what you right-clicked.
When you hover the mouse over a button, a ScreenTip appears explaining its name and purpose. 
Some ScreenTips contain keyboard shortcut prompts too. The status bar appears at the bottom 
of the application’s window. Zoom controls adjust the magnification at which you see your work. 
Zoom controls appear on the right end of the status bar, and also on the View tab.
Basic Features of Office Applications
To open the Help system in an application, press F1, or choose Help from the File menu, or click 
the Help icon in the upper-right corner of the application window.
To scroll in the document, use the scroll bars. You can drag the scroll box, or click above or 
below the scroll box, or click one of the scroll arrows.
To select content, drag across it with the mouse, or click where you want the selection to begin and 
hold down Shift as you click at the other end or use the arrow keys to extend the selection area.
The Office Clipboard is like the Windows Clipboard except it has more features, and is available 
only in Office applications. It can hold up to 24 items.
Undo reverses the last action. Use the Undo button on the QAT or press Ctrl+Z. Redo reverses 
the reversal; press Ctrl+Y or use the Redo button on the QAT.
The insertion point is where text you type will appear. You can move it by clicking where you 
want it. In Excel, a cell cursor, a thick line around a cell, indicates that it is active, and text you 
type will be placed in it.
Office files can have themes applied, which are sets of formatting presets. They consist of font, 
color, and graphic effect choices. You can also apply each of those separately (color theme, font 
theme, effect theme). When you choose colors, you select from a color palette that contains 
theme colors, variants of theme colors, and standard colors.
A framed object within an Office document is called an object. Objects can include charts, graph-
ics, and text boxes. Drag a selection handle on an object to resize it, or drag the object itself to 
move it. Drag the border to move a text box.
Saving, Opening, and Creating Files
To save a file, use the Save command on the File menu. The first time you save a file, you are 
prompted for a name, location, and type in the Save As dialog box. When you save subsequent 
times, you are not prompted. If you want to be prompted, use the Save As command instead.

272
Part III: Microsoft Office
To open a file, use the Open command on the File menu. Navigate to the location of the file in 
the same way you do in Windows Explorer. To close a file, use the Close command.
When you create new files, you can create a blank file or you can start with a template. Select a 
template from the New category on the File menu.
Printing and Sharing Files
To print your work, open the File menu and click Print. Then use the controls that appear to 
specify the options for the print job.

Customizing the Status Bar
The status bar’s content varies, not only between applications, but also with customization. Right-click 
the status bar in any application for a menu of items you can show or hide on it (see Figure 8.21).
Figure 8.21  Right-click the status bar to choose what information should appear there.
More Keyboard Shortcuts
Each application has an extensive set of keyboard shortcuts available. Open the application’s Help 
system and search for Keyboard Shortcuts to see an article that lists the complete set. There are 
separate sets of shortcuts for various situations. For example, there are shortcuts for moving the 
insertion point, shortcuts for scrolling, shortcuts for selecting, shortcuts for commands, and so on.
Can’t get enough of working with the keyboard? Each Ribbon tab and command has a keyboard 
equivalent too. To see them, press the Alt key, as shown in Figure 8.22. Key tips appear next to 
each tab and command name. Then press that key to choose that command. (You have to press 
Alt each time to use these shortcuts.) This is how people who can’t use a mouse navigate in Office 
applications, by the way.

More Application Options
For some of the more obscure settings in an application’s options, check out the Advanced cat-
egory in the Options dialog box. You might be surprised at some of the changes you can make. 
For example, in Word, you can set default behaviors for cutting, copying, and pasting data, and in 
PowerPoint you can disable right-clicking during a slide show as a security measure to keep people 
from stopping a slide show at an interactive kiosk.

Ribbon Customization
Some people may find an application easier to use when the Ribbon is customized, but if multiple 
people share a computer, customizations can be a problem. If you were in charge of your school’s 
or workplace’s computers, would you allow people to customize the Ribbon, or not? Explain your

Who uses word processing? Just about everyone! Word processing is the most 
popular type of business productivity application, and Microsoft Word is the most 
popular program for doing it. In almost any workplace, you will be expected to 
know how to use Word to type letters and reports, and depending on your job, 
you might also need to know how to create more complex documents that include 
graphics and tables.
This chapter covers the basic Word skills that you need for success in a modern 
office setting, regardless of your specific job title. You’ll find out how to edit and 
manipulate text, format documents in various ways from individual characters to 
entire pages, insert pictures and tables, and correct your spelling and grammar 
errors. By the time you reach the end of this chapter, you will have all the basic 
information you need to create a variety of documents.

Editing and Formatting Text
In Microsoft Word, you can type directly onto a blank page. Just posi-
tion the insertion point and start typing. As you type, the text wraps to 
a new line automatically when you come to the right margin. To start a 
new paragraph, press Enter. To start a new line without starting a new 
paragraph, press Shift+Enter.
Pressing keys like Enter and the spacebar generates characters, but you 
can’t see them by default. Click the Show/Hide ¶ button on the Home 
tab to toggle the display of non-printing, hidden characters onscreen. 
In Figure 9.1, for example, each space appears as a small dot and each 
paragraph break appears with a paragraph symbol (¶), and each manually 
created line break (Shift+Enter) appears with a bent arrow symbol.
Careers in IT
Word Processing Specialist
Although anyone can learn the basics of word processing, some people take that extra step to become really profi-
cient in all aspects of the software. A word processing specialist is able to create consistent, professional looking 
documents, including memos, forms, legal reports, letters, and technical articles, in a variety of formats. Word 
processing specialist may be a full-time career in itself, or the duties may be combined with those of a general 
administrative assistant or receptionist. To prepare for this career, you should have at least a high school educa-
tion, and have specialized word processing training. Microsoft Office Specialist certification in Microsoft Word at 
the Expert level is recommended.
Figure 9.1  Hidden (non-printing) characters are displayed when you click the Show/Hide ¶ button on the Home tab.

Chapter 9: Word Processing with Microsoft Word
Editing Text
To edit text, you can click or use the arrow keys to position the insertion 
point and then use Backspace to delete to the left of the insertion point 
or Delete to delete to its right. Or, you can select a block of text and 
then press the Delete key to remove it. As you type, the text to the right 
of the insertion point moves over to make room for the new text.
NOTE
Existing text moves to accommodate new inserted text because Word operates in Insert mode by default. The 
alternative is Overtype mode, where new text replaces existing text. To switch to Overtype mode, first enable 
the Overtype indicator on the status bar. Right-click the status bar and choose Overtype. Then you can click 
the word Insert on the status bar to switch to Overtype mode, and then click the word Overtype to switch back 
to Insert mode.
You can move text using the Office Clipboard (by cutting and pasting), 
or you can drag and drop with the mouse to move text. Both techniques 
were covered in Chapter 8, “Understanding Microsoft Word 2010.”
Changing the Text Font
As you learned in Chapter 8, you can change the text font from the Font 
drop-down list on the Home tab. On the Font drop-down list, you’ll 
find all the fonts listed that are available on your computer. Office comes 
with many fonts, so that’s where most of them came from. Others may 
be installed on your PC from Windows itself or from other applications.
Before you choose a specific font from the Font drop-down list, how-
ever, consider whether you might prefer instead to use font placeholders 
and allow Word to apply a consistent font throughout the document, as 
explained next.
At the top of the Font list are two special fonts, marked (Headings) and 
(Body). These are not actual fonts, but placeholders. Every document 
has a default heading font and a default body font. The actual fonts 
assigned to those placeholders are subject to change. In Figure 9.2, the 
fonts assigned are Calibri Light for headings and Calibri for body.
Recall from Chapter 8 that a theme defines three formatting properties 
for the entire document: theme colors, theme fonts (for Heading and 
Body defaults), and theme effects (for graphics). Choosing a different 
theme or theme fonts from the Page Layout tab is one way to redefine 
which fonts are used as the Headings and Body fonts. Look back at the 
section “Understanding Themes and Color Palettes” in Chapter 8 for 
more information.
Another way to redefine the font set is to choose a different style set. 
A style is a named, preset combination of formatting. Word’s default 
template for blank documents includes several styles, including Normal 
(for body text), Heading 1 and Heading 2 (for headings), and Title (for 
document titles). The text in your document appears in Calibri 11-point 
font by default because the Normal style is defined that way. A style set 
is an alternative set of style definitions for the basic built-in styles such as 
style A named, preset combination of formatting.
style set An alternative set of style definitions 
for the basic built-in styles.

280
Part III: Microsoft Office
the ones just mentioned. You can quickly change the look of the entire 
document by applying a different style set. The style definitions in a style 
set include not only font choices but also line spacing and indentation for 
paragraphs.
Figure 9.2  To allow Word to control which font is  
used based on the theme or style set, choose the  
(Heading) or (Body) font from the Font drop-down list.
NOTE
Why are some styles treated as body paragraphs and some styles are treated as headings? It all depends on 
the style’s outline level. If it’s set to Body Text, the (Body) font is applied to it; if it’s set to any of the heading 
levels, the (Heading) font is applied. To check and change a style’s outline level, click the dialog box launcher 
in the Styles group on the Home tab to open the Styles pane, and then right-click a style and choose Modify. 
In the Modify Style dialog box, in the lower-left corner, click Format, and click Paragraph. In the Paragraph 
dialog box, set the Outline Level setting to the desired value.
You will learn more about styles later in this chapter, in the section 
“Working with Styles.”

281
Chapter 9: Word Processing with Microsoft Word
Step by Step
Changing to a Different Style Set
Use these steps to change the style set:
	 1.	On the Home tab, click the Change Styles button.
	 2.	Point to the Style Set command, and on the menu that appears, point to a different style set, and observe the 
formatting change to the document behind the open menu.
	 3.	Click the desired style set to apply it.
Changing to a Different Theme
Use these steps to change the theme:
	 1.	On the Page Layout tab, click the Themes button.
	 2.	Point to a theme, and see its formatting previewed on the document behind the open menu.
	 3.	Click the desired theme.
Changing to a Different Theme Fonts
Use these steps to change only the font aspect of the theme:
	 1.	On the Page Layout tab, click the Theme Fonts button. A list of font themes opens. This list corresponds to the 
overall themes on the Themes list.
	 2.	Point to a theme font set, and see the fonts previewed on the document behind the open menu.
	 3.	Click the desired theme fonts.

282
Part III: Microsoft Office
Changing Font Size
Select a font size from 
the Font Size drop-down 
list on the Home tab (see 
Figure 9.3). As the font sizes 
get larger on the list, they start 
skipping numbers; for exam-
ple, 20 and 22 are both on the 
list, but 21 isn’t. You can type 
an exact font size in the Font 
Size text box above the drop-
down list to use a size that 
isn’t on the list. You can also 
change the font size by clicking the Grow Font or Shrink Font button 
in the Font group. Each time you click one of those buttons, the font 
increases or decreases by one position on the Font Size list. (As pointed 
out earlier, that’s not necessarily one point; with the larger sizes, the 
increase or decrease could be several points.)
Formatting Text
Most people find it simplest to apply formatting from the Font group 
on the Home tab. Word has a few more commands there than the other 
applications because Word’s specialty is text. Figure 9.4 points out the 
text formatting commands in the Font group.
Troubleshooting
Fonts Don’t Change
If the fonts don’t change when they ought to—that is, when you apply a different style set, theme, or theme fonts—
it’s probably because the text has been manually formatted. To strip off manual formatting, select the text and then 
either press Ctrl+spacebar or click the Clear Formatting button in the Font group on the Home tab.
Figure 9.3  Choose a font size, type an exact 
font size, or use the Grow Font or Shrink Font 
button.
Figure 9.4  Use these commands to apply formatting to text in Word.
Some of the commands in the Font group deserve some extra explana-
tion because their functions are not obvious. Text effects, for example, 
opens a menu of types of special effects you can apply to the text, such 
text effects A set of special effects you can 
apply to text, such as outline, shadow, and glow.

283
Chapter 9: Word Processing with Microsoft Word
as Outline, Shadow, and Glow. Superscript makes the text smaller and 
moves it above the baseline, as in X2. Subscript makes it smaller and 
moves it below the baseline, as in H2O. You also can select some presets. 
Figure 9.5 shows the Shadow submenu open from this button.
TIP
You can access additional effects from the Font dialog box. Display the Font dialog box by clicking the dialog 
box launcher in the Font group, and then click the Text Effects button at the bottom of the dialog box to open 
a Format Text Effects dialog box.
Figure 9.5  Select special effects for text from the Text Effects button’s menu.
Figure 9.6  Use the Change Case button to shift the letter cases without 
retyping.
The Change Case button opens a menu from 
which you can choose different text cases. 
This feature enables you to quickly switch 
blocks of text from uppercase to lowercase 
without having to retype. See Figure 9.6.
The Clear Formatting button strips off all 
manually applied text formatting (such as any 
formatting you applied using any of the other 
buttons in the Font group). It leaves any for-
matting that was applied via a style or theme.
The Text Highlight Color enables a high-
lighter, like a highlighting marker you might 
use on a paper copy. You can select from 15 
different highlighter colors. After you turn on 
the feature, the mouse pointer changes to a 
highlighter; drag across the text you want to 
highlight, and then press the Esc key or click the 
button again on the toolbar to turn the feature off.

284
Part III: Microsoft Office
For more font 
formatting choices, 
click the dialog box 
launcher in the Font 
group, opening the 
Font dialog box (see 
Figure 9.7). Here 
you can select a font, 
font style (regular, 
bold, italic, or both 
bold and italic), and 
size, as well as a font 
color, underline 
style, and underline 
color. You can also 
apply a variety of 
text effects. Some 
of these, like Small 
Caps and Double 
Strikethrough, are 
not available on the 
Ribbon, but only in 
this dialog box.
Figure 9.7  Apply text formatting in the Font dialog box.
NOTE
In the Font dialog box, two of the font choices on the Font list are +Body and +Headings. These correspond to 
the (Headings) and (Body) fonts on the Font drop-down list, described earlier.

	 2.	 How do you choose a font size that is not on the Font Size drop-down list?
	 3.	 How would you apply Small Caps text formatting?
Formatting Paragraphs
Paragraph formatting, as the name implies, is formatting that applies to 
entire paragraphs, not to individual characters. For example, line spacing, 
indentation, tab stops, and bulleted and numbered lists are all types of 
paragraph formatting. In the following sections you will learn about the 
paragraph formatting capabilities in Word.
Creating Bulleted and Numbered Lists
Bulleted and numbered lists are both ways of making certain paragraphs 
stand out. Use bulleted lists for lists where the order is not important, 
like a grocery list; use numbered lists where the order is significant, such 
as a set of instructions for making a recipe.
To make a bulleted or numbered list, select the paragraphs to include 
and then click the Bullets or Numbering button on the Home tab (in the 
paragraph formatting Formatting that applies 
to entire paragraphs, not to individual characters.

285
Chapter 9: Word Processing with Microsoft Word
Paragraph group). For the default style, click the face of the button. To 
choose from a gallery of other styles, click the down arrow to the right 
of the button. Figure 9.8 shows the choices from the Bullets button’s 
menu, for example. You can also choose Define New Bullet from that 
library to use any character you like for the bullets.
Figure 9.8  Open the Bullets button’s library for other bullet character choices.
Creating Tab Stops
When you press the Tab key, the insertion point moves to the right until it 
encounters a tab stop. By default, body paragraphs have tab stops every half 
inch, but you can set custom tab stops for any paragraph at any positions.
Tab stops are left-aligned by default, meaning that when the insertion 
point stops at the tab stop, the text that you type at that point is left-
aligned with the tab stop. Tab stops can have several other alignments, 
though. Figure 9.9 shows some examples of the various tab stop types. 
Tab stops can be aligned to the left or right, centered, or decimal—that 
is, aligned with the decimal place in the entry. There is one other type 
of tab stop, called Bar, which places a vertical line between the tabbed 
columns of text at the tab stop position.
Figure 9.9  Examples of tab stop types.
tab stop A non-printing marker in a paragraph 
that stops the insertion point when the Tab key is 
pressed.

286
Part III: Microsoft Office
Tab stop indicators appear on the horizontal ruler above the document, 
as shown in Figure 9.9. (If you don’t see the horizontal ruler, mark the 
Ruler check box on the View tab.)You can place a tab stop on the ruler 
by clicking on the desired spot. If you want a type other than Left, click 
the Tab Type icon at the far left end of the ruler until the desired type 
appears, and then click on the ruler to place it. You can remove a tab 
stop by dragging it downward off the ruler. You can change a tab stop’s 
position by dragging it from side to side.
You can also create tab stops using the Tabs dialog box. The dialog box 
method has the advantage of enabling you to create tab leaders. A leader 
is a repeated character between the text before the tab stop and the tab 
stop. Leaders are sometimes used in tables of contents to help the eye 
follow across to the page number, as in Figure 9.10.
Figure 9.10  A tab leader.
Step by Step
Setting Tab Stops with the Tabs Dialog Box
Use these steps to create a tab stop using the dialog box method:
	 1.	Click anywhere in the paragraph to affect, or select multiple paragraphs to affect.
	 2.	Click the dialog box launcher in the Paragraph group on the Home tab.
	 3.	In the Paragraph dialog box, click the Tabs button. The Tabs dialog 
box opens.
	 4.	In the Tab Stop Position box, type a numeric value representing the 
tab stop’s position on the ruler, in inches.
	 5.	In the Alignment section, select the tab type.
	 6.	In the Leader section, if desired, select a leader character.
	 7.	Click Set.
	 8.	If you want to set another tab stop, repeat Steps 4 through 7. 
Otherwise click OK.
Modifying a Tab Stop with the Tabs Dialog Box
Follow these steps to modify an existing tab stop using the Tabs dialog box:
	 1.	Double-click the tab stop on the ruler. The Tabs dialog box opens.
	 2.	Make any changes as needed to the tab’s settings in the dialog box.
	 3.	Click OK.

287
Chapter 9: Word Processing with Microsoft Word
Indenting Text
Indentation is the amount that a paragraph is offset from the left and 
right margins. If the document has a 1 inch margin on the left, and the 
paragraph has a 0.5 inch left indent, the paragraph will start 1.5 inch 
from the left edge of the paper.
You can set indentation for selected paragraphs by dragging the indent 
markers on the ruler to the left or right. On the left end of the ruler are 
three markers: two triangles and a rectangle, as shown in Figure 9.11. 
The top triangle is the first-line indent marker. It controls the indent 
for the first line of the paragraph. The bottom triangle is the marker for 
all the subsequent lines of the paragraph (other than the first one). You 
can drag it to adjust the indent for just those lines. The square is the 
left indent marker; dragging the rectangle moves both triangles at once, 
keeping them in the same relational position to one another. At the right 
end of the ruler is a single triangle, representing the right indent for the 
paragraph.
indentation The amount that a paragraph is 
offset from the document margins.
TIP
A quick way to increase or decrease the left indent for a paragraph is to click the Increase Indent or Decrease 
Indent button on the Home tab (in the Paragraph group).
Figure 9.11  Indent markers on the ruler.
You can also set indentation from the Paragraph dialog box. The dialog 
box method has the advantage of being able to set an exact numeric 
value for the indents. The settings available there are Left, Right, and 
Special. The Special indent has a drop-down list containing two options: 
First Line and Hanging. They are both technically first-line indents, but 
the First Line setting indents the first line more than the general Left 
indent for the paragraph, and Hanging indents the first line by less than 
the general Left indent.
NOTE
First-line indents are commonly used in publishing to make paragraphs easier to read. The first paragraph 
below a heading is not usually first-line indented, but all the subsequent ones are.

288
Part III: Microsoft Office
NOTE
The Mirror Indents check box enables different left and right indents depending on whether the page is odd or 
even. It is used in situations where you are binding double-sided pages at the left and you want to leave extra 
indentation on one side or the other depending on whether the selected paragraph(s) fall on the right or left 
side of the binding.
Step by Step
Setting Paragraph Indents Using the Paragraph 
­Dialog Box
Use these steps to set paragraph indents using the dialog box 
method:
	 1.	Click anywhere in the paragraph to affect, or select mul-
tiple paragraphs to affect.
	 2.	Click the dialog box launcher in the Paragraph group on 
the Home tab. The Paragraph dialog box opens.
	 3.	On the Indents and Spacing tab, in the Indentation sec-
tion, set indentation settings for Left and Right indents.
	 4.	(Optional) If you want the first line indents to be different, 
open the Special drop-down list and choose First Line or 
Hanging and then enter an amount of additional indenta-
tion for the first line.
	 5.	Click OK.
NOTE
Documents created using the default settings have a line spacing of 1.08 and an After setting of 8 pt. 
If you want to choose one of the line spacing presets, you can do so 
from the Line Spacing button’s menu on the Home tab, as shown in 
Figure 9.13. For example, you could increase the line spacing slightly by 
choosing 1.15, or go for even more spacing with 1.5. You can also add 
or remove space before or after the paragraph from this menu.
Setting Line Spacing
Line spacing is the vertical blank space between each line of a paragraph. 
A paragraph can also have extra spacing before or after it. In Figure 9.12, 
notice that the paragraphs have a smaller amount of space between their 
individual lines than they do between them.

Working with Styles
As you learned earlier in the chapter, a style is a named collection of 
formatting attributes that you can apply simultaneously. For example, the 
default Heading 1 style consists of the font assigned to the (Headings) 
placeholder, 14 points in size, bold, and blue in color, with 24 points of 
space before the paragraph and no space after the paragraph.
Each template comes with a set of styles. The default Normal template 
comes with several heading styles, named Heading 1, Heading 2, and so 
on, as well as a Normal style (used for body text) and a Title style (for 
the document title).
	 3.	On the Indents and Spacing tab, in the Spacing section, 
open the Line Spacing drop-down list and select Single, 
1.5 Lines, or Double if you want one of those presets.
	
	 Or, select a unit of measurement, and then set a value in 
the text box to the right of it. The units of measure avail-
able are:
◾	 At Least: Specifies a minimum spacing, in points. The 
spacing might increase depending on the font size.
◾	 Exactly: Specifies an exact spacing, in points. The spac-
ing will not increase or decrease with font size changes.
◾	 Multiple: Specifies a multiple of 1 (which is single spac-
ing). The number is expressed as a multiple of single 
spacing, whatever spacing that entails based on the 
font size. For example, you could specify 1.15 or 1.75.

Storing Styles in a Template
Using styles in your documents can save a great deal of time because you can apply the same formatting over 
and over, not only within the same document, but across multiple documents. Start a new blank document, and 
create all the styles in it that you want. Then use the Save command (covered in Chapter 8) to save the docu-
ment as a template. (To do that, set the document type to Word Template.) Then whenever you want to create a 
document that employs those styles, start the new document based on that template, and the styles will be there 
waiting for you.

291
Chapter 9: Word Processing with Microsoft Word
To apply a style, click in the paragraph you want to affect, or select the 
text you want to affect if you want more or less than one paragraph. 
Then choose a style from the Styles group on the Home tab. If you 
don’t see the style you want, click the More button (
) to open the 
Styles gallery. Not every style appears in the gallery, though. For a full list 
of all available styles, click the dialog box launcher in the Styles group to 
open the Styles pane, as shown in Figure 9.14.
Figure 9.14  Choose a style from the Styles gallery or open the Styles pane to select one.
To modify a style, apply the style to some text, and then change that 
text’s formatting. Then right-click the style in the Styles pane and choose 
Update stylename to Match Selection.
You can also create new styles of your own. To do so, use the following 
steps.
Step by Step
Creating a New Style
Use these steps to create a new style:
	 1.	Format a paragraph exactly the way you want the new style to be, and select the paragraph.
	 2.	At the bottom of the Styles pane, click the New Style button (
). The Create New Style from Formatting dialog box 
opens.

Formatting Documents and Sections
Some types of formatting, such as margin settings, number of columns, 
and paper size, apply to the entire document. They aren’t relevant to 
individual paragraphs or characters because they deal with entire pages 
or groups of pages. In the following sections, you will learn how to apply 
settings that affect the document as a whole.
Creating Page Breaks
When you reach the bottom of a page, Word starts a new page automatically. 
That’s called a soft page break. If you add or remove text so that a change 
to the break point is required, Word makes it automatically. You can also 
insert a hard page break, which is a manually placed break. To do so, press 
Ctrl+Enter, or on the Page Layout tab, click the Breaks button and click Page.
soft page break A page break made automati-
cally by the application when the current page is full.
hard page break A page break created by the 
user in order to force a page break in a certain place.

293
Chapter 9: Word Processing with Microsoft Word
Creating Section Breaks
As mentioned earlier, certain settings apply to the entire document. 
What if you want to have two different values 
for one of these settings that are normally 
document-wide? For example, suppose you 
wanted a business letter and its envelope to 
be stored in the same document file, and the 
envelope has different dimensions than the 
letterhead paper. In a case such as that, you 
would create a section break. A section break 
divides the document, allowing you to have 
different document-wide settings on each side 
of the break.
Section breaks can be Continuous (which means 
Word doesn’t start a new page at the break), 
Next Page (which does include a page break with 
the section break), Even Page, or Odd Page. 
Those latter two not only insert a page break but 
also make sure that the text that follows the break 
begins on either an even or odd page number, 
and it inserts a second page break if needed to 
ensure that. To insert a section break, from the 
Page Layout tab, click Breaks, and then click 
the desired section break type from the Section 
Breaks section of the menu. See Figure 9.15.
section break A divider in a document that 
allows settings that are normally document-wide 
to be applied differently in parts of the document.
Figure 9.15  Choose a section break type from the Breaks button’s menu.
NOTE
In some circumstances, Word creates sections breaks automatically. For example, if you select one or more para-
graphs and then issue one of the document-wide commands found in the Page Setup group on the Page Layout 
tab, such as Columns, Size, or Orientation, Word automatically adds a section break before and after the selected 
paragraphs, and applies the settings only to the section between them (that is, the text you have selected).
Step by Step
Creating a Section Break
Use these steps to insert a section break:
	 1.	Position the insertion point where you want the section break, or select the text that you want to be in its own section.
	 2.	On the Page Layout tab, click Breaks and then click the desired section break type.
Deleting a Section Break
Use these steps to remove a section break:
	 1.	On the Home tab, click the Show/Hide ¶ button if hidden characters are not already displayed. The section break 
becomes visible.
	 2.	Select the section break and press the Delete key, or position the insertion point to the right of (or below) the sec-
tion break and press the Backspace key.

Changing the Paper Size and Orientation
You can set the Size setting in Word to accommodate any paper size you 
have and that your printer can accommodate. You can also set the ori-
entation of the page. The orientation is either portrait (the default) or 
landscape. On a portrait page, the text runs parallel to the narrower edge 
of the paper; on a landscape page, the text runs parallel to the wider edge.
orientation The direction that the text runs in rela-
tion to the paper. Can be either portrait or landscape.
portrait The page orientation in which the text 
runs parallel to the narrow edge of the paper.
landscape The page orientation in which the text 
runs parallel to the wide edge of the paper.
TIP
If you choose a paper size that’s smaller than your actual paper, Word prints on only part of the paper, and 
you can trim the paper down to the desired size later.
Figure 9.16  Choose a paper size from the Size 
button’s drop-down list.
Size and orientation are both 
controlled from the Page 
Layout tab, in the Page Setup 
group. On the Size menu, 
shown in Figure 9.16, you can 
choose from many popular 
paper sizes, or you can choose 
More Paper Sizes to open the 
Page Setup dialog box and 
create a custom size.

Setting Margins
The margins of a document represent the amount of blank space 
between the edge of the paper and the printable area of the document. 
On the Page Layout tab, you can click the Margins button to open a 
menu of margin presets, or you can choose Custom Margins to open the 
Page Setup dialog box, from which you can select exact margin settings 
for each side of the page, as shown in Figure 9.17.

Numbering Pages
Numbering pages can help you make sure the pages are in order after 
they are printed. It’s easy to drop a stack of papers and lose their origi-
nal order, but page numbering can make the work of putting them back 
together easier. Page numbering can also enable you to refer to a certain 
page when discussing the document with others.
Page numbers are placed in the header or footer, which you will learn 
about later in this chapter, but you don’t have to access the header and 
footer in order to set up page numbering. On the Insert tab, click the 
Page Number button, and then choose the desired position and style, as 
shown in Figure 9.18. Word places an appropriate page numbering code 
in the header or footer automatically.
Figure 9.18  Number pages by selecting a page number position from the Page Number button’s menu.
Working with Headers and Footers
The header and footer areas hold the text that repeats on each page of the 
document, such as the document’s name, a copyright notice, or page num-
bers. The header is at the top of the page, and the footer is at the bottom.
header The area at the top of each page that 
contains consistent or repeated information.
footer The area at the bottom of each page that 
contains consistent or repeated information.

297
Chapter 9: Word Processing with Microsoft Word
NOTE
You can have a different header/footer for the first page of a document, and different headers/footers for 
even- and odd-numbered pages. Each section can also have its own header/footer.
Each document has a header and footer area, but it is empty by default. 
When you use the Page Numbers feature, as in the preceding section, it 
places a code in the header or footer. You can also display the header and 
footer and manually type your own content into it, or insert codes into it. 
When the header and footer are open, you can type only in those areas; the 
rest of the document is dimmed and inaccessible until you close the header 
and footer, as shown in Figure 9.19. A special tab on the Ribbon also 
appears, containing commands for working with the header and footer.
Figure 9.19  Adding a date to the header.
To open the header and footer, you can do any of the following:
◾	 From Page Layout view, double-click the top or bottom of the page.
◾	 On the Insert tab, click Header and then click Edit Header, or click 
Footer and then click Edit Footer. This opens the header or footer 
without putting any content into it automatically.
◾	 On the Insert tab, click Header and then click one of the sample 
header layouts that appear. Or, click Footer and then click one of 
the sample footer layouts.
To discard the contents of the header or footer, click the Header but-
ton and click Remove Header, or click the Footer button and then click 
Remove Footer.
After you have opened the header or footer, you can format it using 
the tools on the Header & Footer Tools tab on the Ribbon, shown in 
Figure 9.19. For example, you can insert a page number code or a date 
and time code, you can set up a different first page, you can set up dif-
ferent odd/even pages, and you can adjust the divider between the main 
document and the header or footer.

298
Part III: Microsoft Office
When you are finished working with the header and footer, double-click 
the main body of the document, or click the Close Header and Footer 
button on the Ribbon.
Using Multiple Columns
A document can have multiple newspaper-style columns. These columns 
can all be the same width, or can be custom widths. And, thanks to 
section breaks, you can have different numbers of columns in certain sec-
tions of the document.
To switch the entire document to multiple columns, click anywhere in 
the document and then on the Page Layout tab, click the Columns but-
ton and select a number of columns. Or, choose More Columns from 
the menu and then set up the columns in the Columns dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 9.20.
To set only part of a document in multiple columns, select the para-
graphs to affect 
before choosing a 
number of columns. 
Word will insert 
continuous section 
breaks on both sides 
of the selection. 
If you want some 
other type of sec-
tion breaks, insert 
the section breaks 
manually first, and 
then position the 
insertion point in 
the desired section 
and choose a num-
ber of columns.
Figure 9.20  Configure column usage in the Columns dialog box.
Put It to Work
Newsletters and Multiple Columns
One common use for a continuous 
section break is to have a newslet-
ter masthead (title) that stretches 
across the entire page, followed 
by a multi-column layout of articles 
beneath it, as shown here.
To create this layout, start by typ-
ing and formatting the newsletter 
title. Then insert a section break 
after it. Then position the inser-
tion point below the section break 
and set the number of columns to 
2, 3, or whatever you want. The text 
 above the section break remains in  
single-column layout.

299
Chapter 9: Word Processing with Microsoft Word
NOTE
Don’t confuse newspaper-style columns with tables, covered later in this chapter. A newspaper-style column 
snakes from the top of the page to the bottom, and then back up to the top again. A table, in contrast, has 
well-defined sections in each column that are parallel to one another.

Working with Pictures
Pictures can add meaning to your documents, and can also make them 
more attractive and interesting. You can insert pictures from your own 
computer, such as those you have taken with a digital camera, and you 
can insert images from Office.com via the Clip Art feature. This is true of 
Excel and PowerPoint too; the skills you learn in the following sections 
will also apply to those applications.
Inserting a Picture
To insert a picture that you already have, position the insertion point 
where you want the picture and then on the Insert tab, click Picture. In 
the Insert Picture dialog box, select the desired picture, and then click 
the Insert button to place it in the document. If it’s the wrong size, or 
in the wrong place, see “Moving and Resizing a Picture” later in this 
chapter.
Finding and Inserting Clip Art
There are two meanings to the term clip art in Office applications. In 
a generic sense, clip art is line art drawing in a vector format. A vector-
based illustration is a line drawing constructed of mathematically 
created lines, like in geometry. (You don’t have to do the math yourself; 
you use drawing tools to create the images. The math is all behind the 
scenes.) Because they are vector graphics, clip art images can be resized 
to any size without loss of quality, and they do not add much to the 
file size. The other meaning of clip art is a piece of art that has been 
acquired through the Clip Art feature in an Office application, regardless 
of its type. It could be a vector graphic, a photo, a video (or animated 
graphic), or a sound file.
The Clip Art feature in Office applications relies on your Internet con-
nection to communicate with Office.com, where most of the clip art 
library is stored. When you search for a clip by keyword in an Office 
application, the application checks to see if you are connected to the 
Internet, and if you are, it includes Office.com images in the search 
results.
clip art 1) A vector-based line drawing. 2) An 
image inserted via the Clip Art feature in Office 
programs.
vector-based illustration A drawing that is 
constructed of mathematically created lines.

Part III: Microsoft Office
Moving and Resizing a Picture
After you insert a picture, it may not be exactly the way you want it. It 
might be the wrong size, or in the wrong position. You can move and 
resize pictures in just the same way you move and resize any other con-
tent in a frame, as you learned in Chapter 8. To move the picture, drag it 
by any part of it (other than a selection handle). To resize a picture, drag 
one of its selection handles. To resize it proportionally, drag a corner 
handle, or hold down the Shift key as you resize. You can also specify an 
exact size on the Picture Tools Format tab, in the Size group.
Adjusting a Picture’s Wrap Text Setting
Text and pictures that occupy adjacent spots in a document interact in 
different ways based on the picture’s Wrap Text setting. The default is 
In Line with Text, which means the picture is treated like a big character 
of text would be treated.
To treat the picture like a floating object and have the text wrap around 
it, set the Wrap Text setting to one of the other settings, like Square, 
Tight, or Top and Bottom. Make your selection from the Picture 
Tools Format tab, from the Wrap Text button’s menu, as shown in 
Figure 9.21. Figure 9.22 shows examples of some of the wrap types.
Wrap Text The feature in Office applications 
such as Word that enables you to specify how the 
graphic should interact with any adjacent text.
Step by Step
Finding and Inserting an Image from Clip Art
Use these steps to locate an image that matches a keyword and insert it in your document:
	 1.	Position the insertion point where you want the image.
	 2.	On the Insert tab, click Clip Art. The Clip Art task pane opens.
	 3.	In the Search For box, type a keyword.
	 4.	Open the Results Should Be drop-down list and make sure the check 
boxes are marked for the content types you want.
	 5.	Click Go. Search results appear in the task pane.
	 6.	Click the clip you want to insert. The clip appears in the document.
	 7.	Close the task pane.

Cropping a Picture
To crop a picture is to cut away the unwanted parts of the picture from 
one or more sides. You can then enlarge the picture if desired, result-
ing in a zoomed-in effect. Cropping is more commonly performed on 
photos than on clip art.
To crop a photo, use the Crop tool on the Picture Tools Format tab, as 
described in the following steps.
crop To cut away the unwanted parts of a picture 
from one or more sides.
Step by Step
Cropping a Photo
Use these steps to crop a photo that has already been inserted into a Word document:
	 1.	Select the photo.
	 2.	On the Picture Tools Format tab, click the Crop button. Black crop handles appear adjacent to the selection 
handles.
	 3.	Drag one of the crop handles inward to decrease the area of the photo. The areas to be excluded appear gray. 
Repeat if needed for another selection handle.
	 4.	Click the Crop button again to finalize the cropping.
Uncropping a Photo
Use these steps to revert cropping on a photo that has already been inserted into a Word document:
	 1.	Select the photo.
	 2.	On the Picture Tools Format tab, click the Crop button. Black crop handles appear over the edges of the cropped 
picture. The parts you cropped out before are still visible in gray.
	 3.	Drag the crop handles to different locations to re-crop, or drag them all out to the edges of the picture to uncrop.

303
Chapter 9: Word Processing with Microsoft Word
CAUTION
The Compress Pictures feature, located in the Adjust group on the Picture Tools Format tab, has an option to 
delete cropped areas of pictures to save disk space. If you use that option, you won’t be able to uncrop the 
photo, or change the cropping in a way that would restore any previously cropped out areas.
TIP
The Crop button’s menu contains several additional options, which you can access by clicking the button’s 
arrow below it. For example, you can crop to a shape, which changes the shape of the picture to any shape 
you choose from Word’s Shapes gallery.
Rotating a Picture
There are three ways to rotate a picture. One way is to drag its rota-
tion handle to rotate it manually, as shown in Figure 9.23. The rotation 
handle is the green circle that appears above a picture when it is selected. 
This method works well when you 
know the look that you want to achieve 
but you don’t care what the numeric 
value of it is.
The second way of rotating a picture is 
to open the Rotate button’s menu from 
the Picture Tools Format tab (Arrange 
group) and choose to rotate the image 
to the right or the left by 90 degrees. 
This method is the quickest, but is only 
good if you happen to want rotation in 
increments of 90 degrees. (For exam-
ple, you could use it twice in a row to 
rotate 180 degrees.)
The third way is to open the Rotate 
button’s menu and choose More 
Rotation Options, opening the Layout 
dialog box and click on the Size tab, 
as shown in Figure 9.24. From there, 
you can set a rotation amount in the 
Rotation text box, from 0 to 359. This 
method is best when you need a precise 
amount of rotation.

Working with Tables
The term table has different meanings in different applications. As you 
will see in Chapter 10, “Creating Spreadsheets with Microsoft Excel,” 
an Excel table is a range of cells grouped together to manage structured 
data stored in them. In Word and PowerPoint, however, a table is much 
more informal than that. A table in Word and PowerPoint is simply a 
grid of cells into which you can place data to help organize it and present 
it in orderly rows and columns. Figure 9.25 shows an example of a docu-
ment that benefits from using a table.
table In Word or PowerPoint, a grid of cells into 
which you can place data to help organize and 
present it in orderly rows and columns.

305
Chapter 9: Word Processing with Microsoft Word
Figure 9.25  A table organizes information in rows and columns.
Two contextual tabs are available when working with a table. The Table 
Tools Layout tab, shown in Figure 9.25, contains commands for chang-
ing the structure of the table—for example, adding and removing rows 
and columns. The Table Tools Design tab, which you will work with 
later in this chapter, contains commands for changing the formatting of 
the table, such as the cell background color and the width of the border 
lines.
Notice the small box in the upper-left corner of the table in Figure 9.25, 
containing a four-headed arrow. This is the table selector. You can click it 
to select the whole table. This is useful to do before you apply a format-
ting command that should affect the whole table, for example.
Creating a Table
To create a table, use the Table button on the Insert tab. When you click the 
button, a menu appears containing several different tools for creating tables. 
At the top of the menu is a grid of squares. You can drag across the grid 
with your mouse to select a certain number of rows and columns, as shown 
in Figure 9.26. When you release the mouse button, a table appears in your 
document.
If you prefer, you can use a dialog box to create a table instead. On the 
Table button’s menu (refer to Figure 9.26), select Insert Table, and then 
you can select a number of rows and columns from a dialog box.

306
Part III: Microsoft Office
Figure 9.26  Create a table by dragging across the squares on the Table button’s menu.
For maximum flexibility, you can draw your own table. From the Table 
button’s menu, choose Draw Table, and your mouse pointer turns into 
a pencil. Drag to draw a rectangular frame that will form the outside of 
the table, and then drag to draw each vertical and horizontal line in the 
table. This method works well when you need a table with a complex 
split of row and column dividers in different parts of the table, as in 
Figure 9.27. Use the Eraser tool to correct any mistakes or to remove 
any unwanted line segments. Then click the Draw Table button again to 
continue drawing more lines in the table if needed.
Figure 9.27  Draw a table with the exact cells you want; they don’t have to be the same for every row and column.

307
Chapter 9: Word Processing with Microsoft Word
TIP
Even if you create the table with one of the other methods, you can still use Draw Table to modify the table 
whenever you like. The Draw Table and Eraser buttons are available on the Table Tools Layout tab.
Typing in a Table
To type in a table, just click in a cell and begin typing. Text automatically 
wraps to another line when it reaches the edge of the cell. You can use 
most of the same text entry techniques as with any other text, such as 
Enter for a paragraph break and Shift+Enter for a line break.
To move to the next cell, you can click in it, or you can press the Tab key 
to move to it. The next cell is the one to the right of the active cell, or if the 
active cell is the rightmost one in a row, the next cell is the leftmost cell on 
the next row. If you press the Tab key in the rightmost cell in the bottom 
row, Word starts a new row. To go back to the previous cell, press Shift+Tab.
Adjusting Column Widths
To adjust a column width, position the mouse pointer over the border 
between two columns and drag. What happens to the other columns in 
the table when you change one column’s width? It depends on what key 
you press, if any, as you drag. Table 9.1 summarizes the differences.
Table 9.1 Adjusting Column Width
Hold Down
Result
No key
The columns to the left and the right change their relative sizes, but the amount of space they take up col-
lectively does not change. No other columns change, and the overall size of the table does not change.
Ctrl key
The column to the left of the divider you are dragging is resized; all other cells in the table are adjusted propor-
tionally to maintain the same relative ratio between the sizes. The overall size of the table does not change. 
Shift key
The cell to the left of the divider you are dragging is resized. No other cells change size; the overall size 
of the table changes.
You can also change the size of a row or column by specifying an exact value 
in the text boxes on the Table Tools Layout tab in the Cell Size group, as 
shown in Figure 9.28. Also in this group are Distribute Rows and Distribute 
Columns buttons, which equalize the height of the rows or the width of the 
columns in the table without changing the table’s overall dimensions.
Figure 9.28  Set an exact size for cell height or width in the Cell Size group.

308
Part III: Microsoft Office
You can also AutoFit the column width to the widest entry in that col-
umn. To do so, double-click the divider between the column to AutoFit 
and the one to its right.
Selecting Rows, Columns, or Cells
Before you issue certain commands, such as commands that apply 
formatting, you must select the cells you want to affect. You can select 
entire rows and columns, individual cells, or ranges (rectangular groups 
of cells).
To select an entire row, position the mouse pointer to the left of the row 
(outside of the table), so the mouse pointer becomes a white arrow that 
points slightly to the right ( ), and then click.
To select an entire column, position the mouse pointer above the 
column (again, outside of the table), so the mouse pointer becomes a 
down-pointing black arrow (
), and then click.
To select certain cells, drag across them with the mouse. To select one 
individual cell, right-click it, point to Select, and click Cell.
Inserting and Deleting Rows and Columns
To insert a new row at the bottom of the table, click in the last cell (bot-
tom right) and press the Tab key.
If you want a row in some other position, or a new column, use the 
Table Tools Layout tab. In the Rows and Columns group are buttons for 
inserting new rows or columns either before or after the active cell’s row 
or column. (Refer to Figure 9.28.) If you want to insert multiple rows or 
multiple columns, select a corresponding number of rows or columns in 
the table before clicking one of these buttons.
To delete a row or column, select the row or column and then click the 
Delete button in the Rows and Columns group, on the Table Tools 
Layout tab.
TIP
As an alternative method of inserting or deleting rows or columns, you can right-click a selected row or col-
umn and choose Insert or Delete commands from the shortcut menu that appears.
Merging and Splitting Cells
As you saw earlier in the chapter, you can use the Draw Table and Eraser 
tools to add and remove borders in your table. This is one way of merg-
ing and splitting cells. Click Draw Table and then drag a dividing line to 
split a cell into two pieces by drawing another line. Repeat as many times 
as needed. Click Erase and then click any dividing line to merge two cells.
Another way to merge and split cells is with the Merge Cells and Split 
Cells buttons on the Table Tools Layout tab.

309
Chapter 9: Word Processing with Microsoft Word
Formatting a Table
You can format each individual cell of a table with a certain background 
color (fill) and your choice of borders around each side of it (color, style, 
and thickness). However, it is often easier to apply a table style to the 
entire table, which applies preset combinations of formatting chosen to 
work well together. See Figure 9.29.
To choose a table style, open the gallery in the Table Styles group on the 
Table Tools Design tab and make your selection of colors and styles. The 
colors are from the theme colors currently applied. (See Chapter 8 for 
more information about themes and theme colors.)
Figure 9.29  Select a table style to format the entire table at once.
table style A style that applies to an entire 
table, formatting it with a set of preset formatting, 
including borders and sharing.
Step by Step
Merging Cells
Use these steps to merge two or more cells:
	 1.	Select the cells to merge.
	 2.	Click the Merge Cells button on the Table Tools Layout tab.
Splitting Cells
Use these steps to split a cell:
	 1.	Select the cell(s) to split.
	 2.	Click the Split Cells button on the Table Tools Layout tab. The Split Cells dialog 
box opens.
	 3.	Specify a Number of Columns and Number of Rows.
	 4.	Click OK.
You can set certain cells to be differently formatted by marking or 
clearing the check boxes in the Table Style Options group, as shown in 
Figure 9.29. For example, you can make the first row (Header Row) or 
last row (Total Row) different, or the first or last column different. You 
can also specify whether or not you want rows or columns to be banded 
(alternating in color).
To manually format certain cells, select them and then use the Shading 
or Borders button in the Table Styles group to apply different borders or 
shading to only the selected cells.

Correcting and Collaborating
In most business environments, more than one person has input on a 
document. You might create a document initially on your own, but your 
supervisor and coworkers may review it and add comments, or you may 
collaborate with multiple teammates throughout the process. In the fol-
lowing sections, you will learn about some features that make it easy to 
correct your work and collaborate with others.
Finding and Replacing Text
You might sometimes need to find certain words or phrases in an exist-
ing document, and you might also need to replace them with some 
other words or phrases. For example, if the contact person changes for a 
company to which you are selling products, you might need to find and 
replace all instances of the previous representative’s name in a contract or 
bid proposal. You could also use Find and Replace to repurpose an exist-
ing document for a new customer or product.
Word has two different Find methods. The first one is easy, and involves 
the Navigation pane. The other one has more options, and uses the Find 
and Replace dialog box.
Step by Step
Finding Text Using the Navigation Pane Method
Use these steps to find a text string in a document using the Navigation pane:
	 1.	On the Home tab, in the Editing group, click Find, or press Ctrl+F. The Navigation task pane appears.
	 2.	In the Search Document text box, type the text for which to search. Search results appear immediately in the 
pane.
	 3.	Click the first instance found to jump to it in the document. Click each additional instance to jump to it as needed.
	 4.	When you are finished, close the Navigation pane.
Finding Text Using the Dialog Box Method
Use these steps to find a text string in a document using a dialog box:
	 1.	On the Home tab, in the Editing group, click the down arrow on the Find button, and on the menu that appears, 
click Advanced Find. The Find and Replace dialog box opens with the Find tab displayed.
	 2.	In the Find What box, type the text you want to find.
	 3.	(Optional) To set options, click the More button to expand the dialog box, and then specify any options desired, 
such as matching the case of the text, finding whole words only, or using wildcards.

311
Chapter 9: Word Processing with Microsoft Word
TIP
Wildcard searches use the * (asterisk) symbol to represent any number of characters and the ? (question 
mark) symbol to represent a single character. For example, L?ve would find the words Love and Live; L* would 
find all words that begin with the letter L.
	 4.	(Optional) To find only text with certain formatting, click the Format button in the dialog box and select a type of 
formatting, and then set the specifications that the found text must have.
	 5.	(Optional) To find some special character, click the Special button in the dialog box and select the desired charac-
ter. For example, you might search for section breaks using this option.
	 6.	Click Find Next. The first instance appears.
	 7.	Continue clicking Find Next until you have found all instances, or click Cancel to close the dialog box.
Replacing is a lot like finding using the dialog box method; in fact, it 
uses the same dialog box, but a different tab in it. The Replace tab has all 
the same features as the Find tab, but it also has a text box in which you 
can type the text that should replace the found text.
Step by Step
Replacing Text
Use these steps to find a text string in a document using the Navigation pane:
	 1.	On the Home tab, in the Editing group, click Replace, or press Ctrl+H. The Find and Replace dialog box opens to 
the Replace tab.
	 2.	(Optional) If the advanced options don’t already appear, and you want to use them, click the More button.
	 3.	Set any advanced options for the Find portion of the operation, as described in the previous steps.
	 4.	In the Replace With box, type the text string you want to replace the found string with.

Correcting Spelling and Grammar
Everyone makes spelling and grammar errors now and then, even if they 
are just typographical errors. Word has tools for helping correct these 
before anyone else sees them, including both Spelling and Grammar 
checkers.
As you type, Word points out any words that are not in its diction-
ary with a red wavy underline. You can right-click the wavy-underlined 
word or phrase to see a shortcut menu of possible fixes. As shown in 
Figure 9.30, you can do any of the following:
	 5.	Click Find Next. The first instance is located.
	 6.	If you want to replace this instance, click Replace; otherwise, click Find Next. You can also click Replace All to 
replace all instances at once.
	 7.	Continue working through all instances, or click Cancel to close the dialog box.
Figure 9.30  Right-click a word with a wavy red underline to see a menu of correction choices.
◾	 Accept a suggested correction: One or more suggested spell-
ings appear at the top of the menu; click one to instantly make the 
correction.
◾	 Ignore the error: You can choose Ignore to ignore it once (turn-
ing off the wavy red underline) or Ignore All to ignore all instances 
of the same word within this document only.
◾	 Add the word to the dictionary: You can add the word to 
Office’s list of accepted words, so the word will not be flagged as 
misspelled in any document in the future.

313
Chapter 9: Word Processing with Microsoft Word
◾	 Set up AutoCorrect: You can choose to set the misspelling up as 
an AutoCorrect entry, so that any time in the future when you type 
this particular misspelling, Word will automatically change it to the 
correct spelling you specify.
◾	 Choose a different language: You can change what language the 
Spelling feature is working with; this changes which built-in and 
custom dictionaries it consults.
◾	 Open the Spelling and Grammar dialog box: Choose Spelling to 
open this dialog box, from which more choices are available.
A wavy green underline indicates a possible grammar error, as shown in 
Figure 9.31. Check the entry carefully, and make a correction if needed. 
Keep in mind, however, that Word’s Grammar feature sometimes makes 
mistakes, so do not rely on it over your own judgment. You can cor-
rect the sentence manually if you understand what is wrong with it; if 
you don’t, choose About This Sentence to open the Help system to the 
page where this type of error is explained. You can also choose Grammar 
to open the Spelling and Grammar dialog box, where more options are 
available.
Figure 9.31  Right-click a word or phrase with a green underline to see Word’s suggestions 
for correcting grammar.
If you want to review the entire document at 
once, instead of scanning through it looking 
for wavy underlines, on the Review tab click 
Spelling. The Spelling and Grammar dialog 
box opens, displaying the first error found. The 
controls in the dialog box depend on whether 
it is a spelling error or a grammar error; 
Figure 9.32 shows the dialog box for a spelling 
error. All the options from the shortcut menus 
are available (refer to Figures 9.30 and 9.31), 
plus additional options. For example, you can 
click the Options button to open the spell-
ing options in the Word Options dialog box. 
From there, you can create and edit custom 
dictionaries, set proofreading options, edit 
AutoCorrect entries, and more.
Figure 9.32  You can also check spelling and grammar from the Spelling 
and Grammar dialog box.

TIP
Another way to access the spelling and grammar options is this: Click the File tab, click Options, and then 
click Proofing.
Tracking and Accepting Changes
When editing someone else’s work, you might want to mark your 
changes so that they can be reviewed easily. Word’s Track Changes feature 
enables you to track each person’s changes individually, marking each one 
with a different color, so multiple people’s suggestions and changes can 
be reviewed in a single copy without losing any information about what 
the document originally contained. Figure 9.33 shows an example of a 
document with tracked changes. Depending on Word’s settings, some or 
all changes may also appear in balloons, which appear to the right of the 
document. Figure 9.33 shows one balloon. By default, only comments 
(covered later in this chapter) and formatting changes appear in balloons.
balloon A rounded text box appearing in the 
space to the right of the document, containing a 
comment or a tracked change.
Figure 9.33  A document with tracked changes.
Step by Step
Enabling or Disabling Change Tracking
Use these steps to begin or stop tracking changes:
	 1.	On the Review tab, in the Tracking group, click the Track Changes button.
Setting Change Tracking Options
Use these steps to customize the way change tracking works:
	 1.	On the Review tab, in the Tracking group, click the arrow below the Track Changes button. A menu appears.
	 2.	Click Change Tracking Options. The Track Changes Options dialog box opens.
	 3.	Make any changes to the settings as desired.
	 4.	Click OK.

315
Chapter 9: Word Processing with Microsoft Word
Also in the Tracking group on the Review tab, you’ll find these buttons 
for controlling what you see onscreen when tracking changes:
◾	 Display for Review drop-down list: From here, you can change 
what you see onscreen in terms of the changes:
◾	 Final: Show Markup shows the document in its edited form 
with the changes tracked.
◾	 Final shows the document in its edited form with the tracked 
changes hidden.
◾	 Original: Show Markup shows the document in its original 
form with the changes tracked.
◾	 Original shows the document in its original form and hides 
the tracked changes.
◾	 Show Markup drop down list: You can specify which types of 
changes you want to see when markup is displayed. For example, if 
you don’t care about formatting changes, you choose Formatting 
from this list to clear its check box.
◾	 Reviewing Pane drop-down list: Enables you to choose between 
a vertical or horizontal reviewing pane. The reviewing pane lists 
all changes in the document, so you can jump to a change easily. 
To turn the reviewing pane on or off, you can click the face of the 
Reviewing Pane button rather than opening its drop-down list.
One way to review the tracked 
changes in the document is to 
manually browse through and 
look at each one. Right-click a 
change and then choose Accept 
or Reject from the shortcut 
menu. The exact wording 
depends on the type of change. 
Figure 9.34 shows Accept 
Insertion and Reject Insertion, 
for example.
You can also use the Review tab 
to review the changes. In the 
Changes group, use the Next 
and Previous buttons to move among the changes, and then use the 
Accept or Reject button to specify how to handle each one.
Changing the User Name
Word shows each user’s changes in a different color. If you want to change to a different user name, follow these steps:
	 1.	On the Review tab, in the Tracking group, click the arrow below the Track Changes button. A menu appears.
	 2.	Click Change User Name. The Word Options dialog box opens.
	 3.	Change the name in the User Name box.
	 4.	Change the initials in the Initials box.
	 5.	Click OK.
Figure 9.34  Accept or reject a change individu-
ally by right-clicking it and making your selection.

316
Part III: Microsoft Office
To accept or reject all the remaining changes at once, open the drop-
down list for the Accept or Reject button and choose Accept All Changes 
in Document or Reject All Changes in Document.
Making and Reviewing Comments
When you want to make a note in a document without changing its 
contents, you can use a comment. A comment is like a sticky note that 
you attach to a certain spot in the document. It doesn’t print (unless 
you configure Word to print the comments). You can leave comments 
for other people who are working on the document to let them know 
your ideas and opinions. You can read other people’s comments and then 
make changes to the document, make your own comments in response, 
and/or delete the comment.
comment A non-printing note inserted into a 
document to share information or an opinion 
about the document with others editing it.
Step by Step
Inserting a Comment
Follow these steps to create a new comment in a document:
	 1.	Place the insertion point where you want the comment to be attached, or select the text or other object to which 
you want it attached.
	
	 You can attach a comment to one spot in a paragraph, to an individual word, sentence, or paragraph, to multiple 
paragraphs, to a graphic, or to just about anything else.
Privacy and Security
Locking Revision Tracking
If you don’t want others to be able to make untracked changes, or accept or reject 
changes without your permission, you can password-protect the feature. To do so, 
click the Restrict Editing button on the Review tab. In the Restrict Formatting and 
Editing task pane, mark the Allow Only This Type of Editing in the Document check 
box, and then open the drop-down list and choose Tracked Changes. Then click 
Yes, Start Enforcing Protection. In the Start Enforcing Protection dialog box, type 
and retype a password and click OK. Now all changes will be tracked, and only 
those who know the password will be able to make untracked changes.

Chapter 9: Word Processing with Microsoft Word
Protecting a Document from Changes
After you have spent a lot of time on a document, you might want to 
make sure that nobody makes unauthorized changes to it. There are sev-
eral ways to protect a document, each with its own features and benefits.
Password Protection
The most basic protection is password protection. You can assign two sepa-
rate passwords for a document: Password to Open and Password to Modify. 
When prompted for the password, the document either opens normally or 
in Read-Only mode, depending on which password the user enters.
	 2.	On the Review tab, click New Comment. A new comment balloon appears to the right of the main document.
	 3.	Type the comment in the balloon.
Moving Among Comments
Follow these steps to find the next or previous comment in the document:
	 1.	Click the Review tab on the Ribbon.
	 2.	In the Comments group, click Next to go to the next comment or Previous to go to the previous comment.
Deleting a Comment
Follow these steps to delete a comment:
	 1.	Right-click the comment balloon.
	 2.	Click Delete Comment.
	
	 OR
	 1.	Click to place the insertion point in the comment.
	 2.	On the Review tab, in the Comments group, click Delete.

318
Part III: Microsoft Office
Applying Non-Restrictive Types of Protection
Word offers a couple of protections that are very weak, in that users 
may circumvent them at will. They exist in order to warn users that the 
document should not be edited without a good reason, but they do not 
prevent the user from overriding the warnings.
Step by Step
Password-Protecting a Document
Follow these steps to password-protect a Word document:
	 1.	Click File and then click Save As. The Save As dialog box opens.
	 2.	At the bottom of the dialog box, click Tools. On the menu that appears, click General Options. The General Options 
dialog box opens.
	 3.	In the Password to Open box, type the password a user must know in order to open and view the document.
	 4.	(Optional) If you want to assign a password to edit, type it in the Password to Modify box.
	 5.	Click OK. The document is now password-protected.
Removing a Password
Follow these steps to stop password-protection on a document:
	 1.	Click File, and then click Save As. The Save As dialog box opens.
	 2.	At the bottom of the dialog box, click Tools. On the menu that appears, click General Options. The General Options 
dialog box opens.
	 3.	Clear the text in the Password to Open and Password to Modify boxes.
	 4.	Click OK.

319
Chapter 9: Word Processing with Microsoft Word
You can recommend read-only access to users so that a warning appears 
when someone opens the document, as shown in Figure 9.35. Users may 
bypass this warning.
Figure 9.35  When read-only access is recommended, this warning box appears when you 
open the file.
You can also mark a document as Final. When you do so, a notice 
appears at the top of the document letting users know that the docu-
ment is finalized, as shown in Figure 9.36, so that they hopefully will 
hesitate before making gratuitous changes. This warning, like the read-
only warning, is easy to override, so it is not to be considered a type of 
security.
Figure 9.36  When a document has been marked as final, this warning appears when you open it.
Step by Step
Recommending Read-Only
Follow these steps to discourage changes in a Word document:
	 1.	Click File and then click Save As. The Save As dialog box opens.
	 2.	At the bottom of the dialog box, click Tools. On the menu that appears, click General Options. The General Options 
dialog box opens.
	 3.	Mark the Read-Only Recommended check box.
	 4.	Click OK.
Marking a Document as Final
Follow these steps to mark a document as final:
	 1.	Click File and then click Info.
	 2.	Click the Protect Document button.
	 3.	Click Mark as Final.

Chapter 9: Word Processing with Microsoft Word
Summary
Editing and Formatting Text
Choose a font from the Font drop-down list, or use the (Headings) and (Body) fonts at the top of 
that list to stick with consistent body and heading fonts. Style sets and themes can apply the same 
fonts to all heading and body paragraphs in the entire document. To apply a different font size, 
choose it from the Font Size drop-down list, or type an exact size in the associated text box. For 
effects such as Bold, Italic, and Underline, use the buttons in the Font group on the Home tab.
Formatting Paragraphs
Paragraph formatting applies to entire paragraphs. For example, you can assign bulleted or 
numbered list formatting to a series of paragraphs. You can set tab stops using the ruler or the 
Tabs dialog box. You can indent a paragraph from the left and right margins, and set the first line 
indent separately from the rest of the paragraph. You can set line spacing, which is the amount of 
vertical space between the lines of a paragraph.
A style is a named collection of formatting attributes you can apply simultaneously. Word has 
built-in styles in the Normal template (and in other templates), and you can also create your own.
Formatting Documents and Sections
An automatically occurring page break is a soft page break. Press Ctrl+Enter to create a hard 
page break. A section break divides the document, allowing you to have different settings for 
different parts of the document that would otherwise be document-wide settings, like margins and 
paper size.
A page’s orientation is either portrait or landscape. The margins of a document represent the 
amount of blank space between the edge of the paper and the printable area of the document. All 
of those features can be set up from the Page Layout tab.
To number the pages, place a page numbering code in the header or footer. You can use the Page 
Number command in the Insert tab. The header holds repeated information for the top of each 
page, and the footer holds it for the bottom of each page.
A document or section can have multiple newspaper-style columns, set up on the Page Layout tab.
Working with Pictures
The term clip art can refer generically to line art in vector format, or to art placed using the Clip 
Art feature in an Office application.
To move a picture, drag it where you want it. To resize a picture, drag one of its selection handles. 
By default, a picture is an inline image; you can make it float so you can drag it freely by changing 
its Wrap Text setting.
To crop a picture, use the Crop tool on the Picture Tools Layout tab. To rotate a picture, drag its 
rotation handle, or use the Rotate button’s menu.
Working with Tables
A table in Word is a grid of cells into which you can place data. To create a table (using any of sev-
eral methods), click the Table button on the Insert tab. Click in a cell and type; press Tab to move 
to the next cell, or Shift+Tab to move to the previous cell.

322
Part III: Microsoft Office
Drag the border between columns to resize a column. The behavior of the other columns depends 
on whether or not you hold down Shift, Ctrl, or neither as you drag.
To select rows, columns, or cells, drag across them. To select a row, you can also click to the left of 
that row; to select a column, you can click above that column outside the table border. To insert 
or delete rows or columns, use the Rows and Columns group’s buttons on the Table Tools Layout 
tab. To merge or split cells, use the Draw Table and Eraser buttons, or use the Merge Cells and 
Split Cells buttons.
To format a table, you can apply a table style from the Table Tools Design tab, or you can select 
individual cells and apply border and shading format to them from that same tab.
Correcting and Collaborating
Use Find and Replace to locate a text string and optionally replace it with another text string. The 
navigation pane method of Find shows all instances in a list in the pane. The dialog box method 
allows options to be set.
Spelling errors are marked with a wavy red underline and grammar errors with a green wavy 
underline. Right-click an error and select a correction, or choose to ignore the error. You can also 
click Spelling on the Review tab to do a full check with a dialog box.
You can track changes by clicking the Track Changes button on the Review tab. Changes may 
appear in a balloon, depending on your settings; they also appear in the Reviewing pane. Changes 
are tracked by user name, so change the user name if you want to represent a different author.
A comment is a non-printing note inserted into a document. Insert a comment using the New 
Comment button on the Reviewing tab. To delete a comment, right-click it and choose Delete.
To protect a document, you can assign passwords to it for opening and/or editing. You can also 
mark a document as final or suggest read-only, although those latter two are not true security 
measures.

Advanced Text Formatting
On the Advanced tab of the Font dialog box, you can set some advanced options for character 
formatting that professional typesetters use. For example, you can change the Scale, Spacing, and 
Position, set up kerning, and use ligatures. Research what these features are (use the Word Help 
system or other web resources), and write a one-page paper explaining each feature, showing 
examples of each.
Modifying a Custom Dictionary
Suppose you add a word to the custom dictionary in Word and then realize that it was a mistake 
to do so. How would you edit the custom dictionary to remove it? Research this, either in Word’s 
Help system or online, and write a step-by-step procedure as if you were describing that process to

Tables
Spreadsheets help us to organize, calculate, and make sense of numeric data. 
Like the orderly row-and-column format of a paper ledger, a spreadsheet enables 
users to organize large amounts of data so that it is easy to understand and easy to 
refer to.
In businesses everywhere, Microsoft Excel is the most commonly used application 
for creating and managing spreadsheets. In this chapter, you will learn the basics of 
Excel, including how to enter data, how to calculate it, how to format it, and how 
to summarize it to find its meaning.

Understanding the Excel Interface
As you learned in Chapter 8, “Understanding Microsoft Office 2010,” 
each Office 2010 application has the same basic controls, including a 
tabbed Ribbon, a title bar, a status bar, scroll bars, and Backstage view. 
Turn back to Chapter 8’s section “Understanding the Office 2010 
Interface” if you need a reminder about these elements. The following 
sections describe some of Excel’s unique features.
Workbooks and Worksheets
Excel calls a data file a work-
book. Each workbook, by 
default, contains three tabbed 
pages. Each page is a work-
sheet. The tabs along the 
bottom of the Excel window 
represent the worksheets, as 
shown in Figure 10.1. You can switch to a different worksheet by click-
ing its tab. If there are so many tabs that you can’t see them all at once, 
use the arrow buttons to the left of the tabs to scroll through them.
workbook An Excel data file, containing one or 
more worksheets.
worksheet A tabbed page of a workbook, 
containing a grid of rows and columns.
Careers in IT 
Project Manager
A project manager makes things happen. Project managers keep all the workers, equipment, locations, and materi-
als on track for a building project, an event, a manufacturing process, or any other rollout that requires advance 
planning. Project managers need training in a variety of fields, including accounting, logistics, people management, 
and, of course, office productivity software. Excel is the go-to tool for project managers because it has so many 
different uses. You can store financial data in Excel to calculate a project’s budget, lists of items and their prices 
and availability, and scheduling constraints for multiple departments. You can use “what if” analysis to determine 
the optimal solution to a problem with multiple variables, and you can produce charts that graphically summarize a 
project’s status.
Figure 10.1  Worksheet tabs at the bottom of 
the Excel window.
TIP
You can change the name of a worksheet by double-clicking the tab and typing a new name.
Rows, Columns, and Cells
Each worksheet consists of a grid of rows and columns. Each row has a 
number, listed along the left side of the screen, and each column has a 
letter, listed along the top of the screen. At the intersection of each row 
and column is a rectangular area called a cell, into which you can type 
content. Together the column letter and the row number form a cell 
address, such as A1. When the letters increment past Z, they begin with 
double letters, AA through AZ, BA through BZ, and so on. The Name 
box, which appears above column A, shows the address of the active cell. 
The active cell is the one with the cell selector (the dark outline) around 
it. For example, in Figure 10.2, the active cell is C4.
cell The intersection of a row and a column in a 
worksheet.
cell address The column letter and the row 
number that intersect to form the cell, such as A2 
or BB6.
Name box The box above cell A1 where the 
name of the active cell appears.
active cell The cell that the cell selector is on. 
Any content entered will appear in the active cell.
cell selector The movable dark outline around 
the active cell.

329
Chapter 10: Creating Spreadsheets with Microsoft Excel
Figure 10.2  The active cell contains the cell selector, and its name appears in the Name box.
Formula Bar
When a cell contains a formula, the result of the formula appears in 
the cell itself. The formula appears in the formula bar, above the 
column headings. For example, in Figure 10.2, the formula in cell C4 
is =C2+C3. Because that cell is active, you can see the formula in the 
formula bar. Cell C4 itself shows the result: 7. Notice that the Name box 
shows the cell’s address: C4. If the cell contains a numeric value or a text 
string, the formula bar shows the same content as the cell itself.
formula bar The bar above the worksheet where 
the contents of the active cell appear. If the active 
cell contains a formula, the formula appears in the 
formula bar and the result of the formula appears 
in the cell itself.
Quick Review
	 1.	 Give an example of a valid cell address.
	 2.	 Under what circumstances does the formula bar display something different than what’s displayed in the active cell?
	 3.	 Which cell’s address appears in the Name box?
Moving Around in a Worksheet
To type in a cell, you must make it the active cell, either by clicking it 
or by using one of the keyboard methods of moving the cell selector. 
Table 10.1 summarizes the keyboard methods.
NOTE
Moving the cell selector is not the same as scrolling. When you scroll the worksheet, you change which cells 
are visible, but you do not change the active cell. Use the scroll bars to scroll, as you learned in Chapter 8.

Typing and Editing Cell Content
To enter content in a cell, make the cell active by moving the cell selector 
to it, as you learned in the preceding section, and then just start typing. 
When you are finished, move to another cell. For example, press Enter to 
move to the cell below the current one, or press Tab to move to the cell 
to its right. You can also click any other cell to save your entry and move 
on. If you want to cancel what you typed, press Esc.
To edit a cell’s content, make the cell active and then do any of the 
following:
◾	 To replace the cell’s content with a new entry, type the new entry.
◾	 To edit the cell’s content without replacing it entirely, click in the 
formula bar and make your edits there, as shown in Figure 10.3, 
or double-click the cell to move an insertion point into it and then 
edit the text directly in the cell.
◾	 To clear all the text from the cell, press the Delete key.
◾	 To clear both the text and the formatting from the cell, click the 
Home tab, click the Clear button, and click Clear All.

Chapter 10: Creating Spreadsheets with Microsoft Excel
NOTE
Just like in Microsoft Word, you can move the insertion point in the cell or in the formula bar by using the arrow 
keys. You can press Backspace to remove the character to its left, or Delete to remove the character to its right.
Working with Ranges
A range is one or more cells that are selected at the same time. A range 
can be a single contiguous rectangular block or multiple cells or groups 
of cells from different locations, including on different worksheets.
Describing a Range
When a range is a contiguous rectangular block, 
its name is written with the upper-left cell address, 
a colon, and the lower-right cell address, like this: 
B2:C8. When a range contains non-contiguous cells 
or blocks, the pieces are separated by commas, like 
this: B2:C8,E2:E8. Figure 10.4 shows that non-
contiguous range. Notice that even though multiple 
cells are selected, there is still only one active cell: 
E2. If you type something with this range selected, 
the typed text will appear in E2.
When an entire row or column is included, the row 
number or column letter appears twice, separated 
by a colon, like this: 10:10 or B:B. When multiple 
entire rows or columns are selected, the range is 
the row numbers or column letters, like this: 10:12 
or B:D.
Selecting a Range
To select an entire row, click its row number. To select an entire column, 
click its column letter. You can select multiple rows or multiple columns 
by dragging across the row numbers or column letters.
You can drag across a contiguous range to select it. To select a non-
contiguous range with the mouse, hold down the Ctrl key as you drag 
across the blocks of cells to select and click the individual cells to select. 
Release the Ctrl key when you are done choosing cells to include.
You can also use keyboard shortcuts to select a range, as shown in 
Table 10-2.

function as a single unit while selected.

Filling in Content in Multiple Cells
If you need to fill in the same value in multiple adjacent cells, you can 
use the fill handle to do so. The fill handle is the small black square in 
the lower-right corner of the cell selector. Drag it in any direction from 
the active cell to fill the same entry into the adjacent cells, as shown in 
Figure 10.5. This feature is called AutoFill.
Figure 10.5  Drag the fill handle (left) to extend the selection to adjacent cells (right).
You can also AutoFill a series, such as days of the week, months of the 
year, or any sequence of numbers. To do so, enter data in the first two 
cells of the series, establishing the pattern you want. For example, to fill 
days of the month, you might type Monday and Tuesday in the two 
cells. To fill a numeric series, type the first two numbers in the series. 
For example, to count by 10 starting with 2013, type 2013 and 2023. 
Then select both cells and drag the fill handle to continue the series. See 
Figure 10.6.

Create Your Own Series
To create new series for Excel to AutoFill, choose 
File➪Options, click Advanced, and then scroll down 
to the bottom of the dialog box and click Edit Custom 
Lists. From here, you can create your own custom lists 
that Excel will use to AutoFill. Click NEW LIST and then 
type the list entries in the List Entries pane, as shown 
here. Click Add to add the series and then click OK to 
close the dialog box.

Changing the Structure 
of a Worksheet
As you input your worksheet’s content, changing the structure of a 
worksheet is easy. You can add and delete columns, rows, and even indi-
vidual cells, merge multiple cells into one big cell, and move and copy 
data from one range to another.

334
Part III: Microsoft Office
Inserting and Deleting Rows and Columns
As you build a worksheet’s content, you might realize that you need 
more or fewer rows or columns between some existing ones. It’s easy to 
insert and delete rows and columns; the others shift over to make room 
(if adding) or to close up the space (if deleting).
Deleting is different from erasing/clearing. The Delete key on the 
keyboard clears the contents of the rows or columns you select, but it 
does not remove them. To remove the rows or columns entirely, use the 
Delete command on the Home tab or on the context menu that appears 
when you right-click the selected row or column.
Step by Step
Inserting Rows or Columns
Use these steps to insert one or more rows or columns:
	 1.	Select the row that the new row should appear above or the column that the new column should appear to the left of.
	
	 If you want to insert multiple rows or columns, select multiple rows or columns. For example, to insert three rows 
above row 10, you would select rows 10, 11, and 12.
	 2.	On the Home tab, click Insert.
Deleting Rows or Columns
Use these steps to delete one or more rows or columns.
	 1.	Select the row(s) or column(s) to delete.
	 2.	On the Home tab, click Delete.
	
	 OR
	
	 Right-click the selected range and choose Delete from the context menu.
Inserting and Deleting Cells
Inserting individual cells can be a layout challenge because the existing 
cells have to go somewhere to make room for them. When inserting cells, 
you specify whether the existing cells should shift down or to the right.
Similarly, deleting individual cells can be challenging because their dele-
tion leaves a “hole” in the spreadsheet that the surrounding cells must fill 
by shifting their positions either up or to the left.
Step by Step
Inserting Cells
Use these steps to insert one or more cells:
	 1.	Select a range where you want the new cells to be inserted. It doesn’t matter if that 
range already contains data.
	 2.	On the Home tab, click the down arrow to the right of the Insert button. The Insert 
dialog box opens.

335
Chapter 10: Creating Spreadsheets with Microsoft Excel
Merging and Unmerging Cells
The orderly grid format of a worksheet means that you have the same 
number of rows in each column, and the same number of columns in 
each row—usually. For special layout effects, you can merge two or more 
cells into a single cell that occupies the same space as the two would have 
taken up separately. Merging is often done to center a title or heading 
across the top of a set of columns, as in Figure 10.7.
merge To combine two or more cells into a  
single cell.
	 3.	Click the option button to describe what should happen to the cells in the selected range.
	 4.	Click OK.
Deleting Cells
Use these steps to delete one or more cells:
	 1.	Select a range of cells that you want to delete.
	 2.	On the Home tab, click the down arrow to the right of the Delete button. The Delete 
dialog box opens.
	 3.	Click the option button to describe what surrounding cells should shift to fill in the 
vacated space.
	 4.	Click OK.
Preventing Others from Changing the Worksheet Structure
Once you get the worksheet the way you want it structurally, you can 
prevent others from changing it. On the Review tab, click Protect Sheet. 
Then in the Protect Sheet dialog box, make sure that the check boxes 
are cleared for Insert Columns, Insert Rows, Delete Columns, and 
Delete Rows. If you want to include a password, do so by typing it in the 
Password to Unprotect Sheet text box. Then click OK.

Part III: Microsoft Office
Figure 10.7  You can merge and center a title over multiple columns.
NOTE
Unlike in Word, you cannot split a single cell into multiple cells. A single cell (at the intersection of one row 
and one column) is the smallest unit you can work with in Excel. You can, however, unmerge a group of 
merged cells.
Step by Step
Merging Cells
Use these steps to merge contiguous cells:
	 1.	Select the cells to merge. Keep in mind that only the text in the upper-left cell will remain after the merge; it will 
appear as the text in the merged cell.
	 2.	On the Home tab, click the Merge and Center button.
Unmerging Cells
Use these steps to unmerge a merged cell:
	 1.	Select the merged cell.
	 2.	On the Home tab, click the down arrow to the right of the Merge and Center button.
	 3.	On the menu that appears, click Unmerge Cells. Note that any text that was deleted as a result of the merge will 
not return when the cell is unmerged.

Chapter 10: Creating Spreadsheets with Microsoft Excel
Moving and Copying Cells and Ranges
To move or copy a cell, or a range of cells, first select the cell(s) to be 
copied. From there you can use the Office Clipboard, as you learned in 
Chapter 8, or you can use drag-and-drop. To drag and drop content, 
position the mouse pointer on the border of the selection so the pointer 
turns into a four-headed arrow, as shown in Figure 10.8. Then drag to a 
new location to move, or hold down the Ctrl key and drag to a new loca-
tion to copy. (If you hold down the Ctrl key, the mouse pointer changes 
to an arrow with a + (plus) sign on it, indicating you are copying rather 
than moving.)
When you move or copy cells that contain references to other cells, 
the references can be either relative or absolute. See “Understanding 
Absolute References” later in this chapter for information about that.

	 3.	 How can you insert multiple rows at a time?
Formatting Cells
Formatting the cells in a worksheet can make it much easier for people 
to read and understand. For example, you could make certain data labels 
stand out by applying background shading to them or making their 
font bold and italic. Formatting can also include making columns and 
rows different sizes to accommodate their contents better, and apply-
ing number formats that can, for example, distinguish currency amounts 
from percentages, or dates and times from quantities. In the following 
sections, you will learn some ways to format cells.
Resizing Rows and Columns
Sometimes a cell is too narrow to hold its contents. When this situation 
occurs, Excel handles it in different ways:
◾	 If the cell contains a numeric value and no number format has been 
applied to the cell, Excel displays the number in scientific format, 
which represents the number in a more compact format. For 
example, it would change the number 223456898 to 2E+08. The 
actual number still exists in the cell and will be used in any calcula-
tions that refer to this cell.
◾	 If the cell contains a numeric value and a specific number for-
mat has been assigned to the cell (besides General, the default), 
a series of # symbols fill the cell instead of the number itself, like 
this: #####.

338
Part III: Microsoft Office
◾	 If the cell contains text and the cell to the right is empty, the text 
overflows into the next cell.
◾	 If the cell contains text and the cell to the right is not empty, the 
text appears truncated.
You can widen the column to make the entry appear normally again. 
There are several methods of changing a column’s width. You can 
AutoFit a column width (resizing the column’s width to accommodate 
the widest entry in it) or make the column a certain size that you specify. 
You can do the same thing with row heights.
When you specify an exact column width, the number you use refers to 
the number of characters that will fit in the cell using the default font 
and font size. For example, the default column width in a blank work-
sheet is 8.43, and the default font is Calibri 11 point. If you use a differ-
ent font or size in that column, the numbers will not match the actual 
number of characters that fit in each cell.
When you specify an exact row height, the number you use is the num-
ber of points of font height. A point is 1/72 of an inch. The default font 
size is 11 point. A row will automatically expand its height to accom-
modate the largest text in it, so you normally do not have to worry 
about adjusting row height. However, if you have previously specified 
or adjusted the row height for a row and then you change the font sizes 
used in that row, the row will no longer auto-adjust, and you will have to 
adjust the row height manually.
AutoFit Automatically resizing a column width or 
row height to fit the largest entry.
point The measurement used to describe font 
height; one point equals 1/72 of an inch.
TIP
When specifying an exact row height, add about 30% to the size of the largest font used in that row so the 
letters will not be tight up against the top of the cell. For example, for an 11-point font, use 15 as the row 
height, and for a 16-point font, use 21 as the row height. That’s what Excel does when it automatically resizes 
row heights.
Step by Step
AutoFitting Column Width or Row Height
Use these steps to adjust a column’s width or a row’s height to fit the largest content in it:
	 1.	Position the mouse pointer between two row letters or between two column numbers. The column to the left or the 
row above will be the one adjusted.
	 2.	Double-click. The column width or row height is adjusted.
	
	 OR
	 1.	Select the rows or columns you want to AutoFit.
	 2.	On the Home tab, click Format and then click AutoFit Column Width or AutoFit Row Height.
Setting an Exact Column Width or Row Height
Use these steps to set the column width or row height to an exact amount:
	 1.	Select the rows or columns you want to affect.

339
Chapter 10: Creating Spreadsheets with Microsoft Excel
Setting Horizontal and Vertical Alignment
By default, text is left-aligned in 
a cell and numbers are right-
aligned. There’s a good reason 
for this custom: Text is read 
from left-to-right (at least in 
English and most European 
languages), and the eye is accus-
tomed to each line starting 
at the left margin. Numbers, 
however, are generally lined up 
on the right, so that numbers 
with different numbers of digits 
can be more easily compared. 
Figure 10.9 shows some text and numbers in cells with the default 
alignments.
You might sometimes want to change these defaults. For example, you 
might want a text label to right-align so that it is closer to the number it 
is labeling, or you might want the column headings to be centered over 
each column.
By default, each cell has a bottom 
vertical alignment, but most people 
don’t notice it because Excel auto-
matically sizes row height to fit the 
text. Therefore, you won’t notice 
the vertical alignment unless the 
text in the cell is smaller than text in 
some other cell in that row, or unless 
the row’s height has been manually 
changed.
To change a cell’s horizontal or 
vertical alignment, select the cell(s) 
and then use the buttons in the 
Alignment group on the Home 
tab, as shown in Figure 10.10.
	 2.	On the Home tab, click Format and then click Column Width, or click Row Height. A dialog box opens.
	 3.	Enter the desired column width (in characters) or row height (in points).
	 4.	Click OK.

and numbers align to the right.

Part III: Microsoft Office
Specifying a Number Format
Number formats specify how a number will be represented in the cell. 
In the Number group on the Home tab are buttons for the three most 
common number formats: Accounting, Percent, and Comma.
Accounting Style: Uses a currency symbol appropriate for 
the country set up in the Windows Region and Language 
settings (see Appendix B, “Customizing Windows 7”). It 
aligns the currency symbol with the left margin of the cell, and aligns the 
rest of the number with the right margin. It uses two decimal places, 
even if the original number had none, and shows negative numbers in 
parentheses. It uses commas as separators between each three digits to 
the left of the decimal point.
Percent Style: Uses a percent symbol to the right of the 
number. Because a percentage is, by definition, 1/100th of 
a whole value, the decimal point in the number is moved 
two places to the right, so .42 becomes 42%. This format does not show 
any digits after the decimal point, so 0.3% (.003) would appear as 0%.
Comma Style: This format is identical to the Accounting 
format except it does not have a currency symbol.
You can select other number formats from the drop-down list in the 
Number group, or click the dialog box launcher in the Number group 
to open the Format Cells dialog box to the Number tab, and fine-tune 
number formatting from there. Many of the number formats can be cus-
tomized, including changing the number of decimal places displayed and 
changing the way negative numbers are represented. For example, the 
options shown in Figure 10.11 are available for the Number format (yes, 
there is a format named Number), which is for general numbers that do 
not fall into one of the other categories.
Figure 10.11  Choose a number format on the Category list and then fine-tune it on the right.
number format A format applied to a cell that 
makes the numbers in it appear in a certain way, 
such as currency or percentage.

341
Chapter 10: Creating Spreadsheets with Microsoft Excel
NOTE
The difference between the Accounting and Currency formats is that Accounting left-aligns the currency 
­symbol and Currency right-aligns it.
Step by Step
Modifying a Number Format
Use these steps to select and then modify a cell’s number format:
	 1.	Select the cell(s) to affect.
	 2.	On the Home tab, open the Number Format drop-down list (in the Number group) and select a format, or click the 
Accounting, Percent Style, or Comma Style button.
	 3.	If you want to change the number of decimal places, click the Increase Decimal or Decrease Decimal button in 
the Number group.
	 4.	(Optional) If you want to make other changes to the number format, click the dialog box launcher in the Number 
group to open the Format Cells dialog box (see Figure 10.11).
	 5.	Make any additional number formatting selections as needed.
	 6.	Click OK.
In addition to normal number formats, Excel also supports Date and 
Time number formats. Excel stores dates as numbers. January 1, 1900, 
is represented by 1, and each day since then is incremented by one whole 
number. January 1, 1901 is 367, for example (366 because it’s a leap 
year, and then one more because it’s the day after 1900 ended). January 
1, 2014, is 41640, for example (365 x 114 years, plus 29 for the extra 
days in the leap years, plus 1 because it’s the new year).
Times are represented by numbers that follow the decimal point in the 
number. For example, 41640.5 is 12:00 noon (half of the day) on January 
1, 2014, and 41640.75 is 6:00 p.m. (three-fourths of the day) on that date.

Applying Cell Borders and Shading
Gridlines are the lines around each cell. They are always there, but  
they don’t always show. On the Page Layout tab, mark or clear the 
View and/or Print check boxes in the Sheet Options group under the 
Gridlines heading to control whether gridlines appear onscreen and/or 
on printouts. See Figure 10.12.
gridlines The lines around each cell, which may 
be visible or not depending on settings.
Figure 10.12  You can choose whether or not gridlines display onscreen and print.
You can optionally set up borders 
for one or more sides of certain cells. 
Borders are decorative lines used to 
enhance the appearance of the work-
sheet and make its meaning clearer. 
Borders can be different colors and 
widths, and can be solid, dotted, 
or dashed lines. A cell can have dif-
ferent borders on different sides. 
Figure 10.13 shows some data in 
which borders have been used to make

To apply a border preset, select the cells to affect, and then open the 
Borders button’s drop-down list on the Home tab (in the Font group) 
and select a border preset, as shown in Figure 10.14. Note that your 
choice will apply to the range as a whole, not to each individual cell. So, 
for example, if you choose to apply a bottom border, only the bottom of 
the bottommost row in the range will receive the border. From this same 
menu you can also choose a line color and a line style (such as dashed 
or double). If you want to make one of those choices, do it first, before 
selecting the preset from the top portion of the list.
If you want to fine-tune the borders even further, choose More Borders 
from the bottom of the list, opening the Border tab of the Format Cells 
dialog box. See the following Step by Step procedure to learn how to use 
this dialog box.

You can also apply a fill to certain cells to help them stand out from oth-
ers. A fill is a background color. You can select a fill from the Fill Color 
button’s palette on the Home tab (Font group). The color palette works 
just like the color palettes you learned about in Chapter 8; select a theme 
color or a standard color. See Figure 10.15.

Formatting Cell Text
Cell text can be formatted just like text in any other Office applica-
tion; you learned about text formatting in Chapter 8. Recall that the 
Home tab contains tools for applying text formatting in its Font group; 
Figure 10.16 labels these controls for your reference. You can choose 
different fonts, sizes, and colors here. You can also click the dialog box 
launcher for the Font group to open the Font tab of the Format Cells 
dialog box.

Entering Formulas and Functions
A formula is a math calculation to be performed, like =2+2. In Excel, 
formulas provide the instructions to perform calculations. A formula 
begins with an equals sign (=), which signals to Excel that what follows it 
is an instruction, not a literal entry.
A formula can contain both numbers and cell addresses. For example, 
the formula =A6+10 adds 10 to whatever value it finds in cell A6. The 
formula =A2*B2 multiplies the value in A2 by the value in B2.
Understanding Order of Operations
Formulas use math operators to express what needs to be done, and 
these math operators have an order of operations, just like in regular 
math. Exponentiation is done first (represented by the ^ symbol), fol-
lowed by multiplication and division (* and / respectively), and then 
finally addition and subtraction (+ and –).
formula A math calculation to be performed 
in an Excel cell. It may refer to other cells for its 
values.
order of operations The order in which math 
operators in a formula are calculated: exponentia-
tion, and then multiplication/division, and then 
addition/subtraction.
NOTE
Exponentiation is the process of taking one number to the power of another. For example, =3^2 is the same 
as 3 to the 2nd power (3 x 3), which is 9. =3^3 is three to the third power (3 x 3 x 3), which is 27.

346
Part III: Microsoft Office
If you want a formula to calculate in some other order than the default, 
use parentheses to indicate what should be done first. For example, the 
formula =1+2*3 would normally produce a result of 7 because you would 
first multiply 2*3 and then add 1 to it. However, the formula =(1+2)*3 
would produce a result of 9 because 1+2 would first be added, and then 
the result of 3 would be multiplied by 3. Figure 10.17 provides a few 
additional examples to review.
NOTE
In functions, you can refer to ranges of cells, like C1:C5. You can’t do that in formulas that are not functions. 
For example, to sum the range C1:C5, if you use the SUM function you can structure it like this: =SUM(C1:C5). 
However, if you do the same with a regular formula using math operators, you must write out each individual 
cell, like this: =C1+C2+C3+C4+C5.
Some functions’ complicated arguments have to be listed in a certain order, 
and it can be difficult to remember which arguments you need. Excel 
offers several ways of helping 
you remember. The simplest is 
the ScreenTip. When you start 
typing a function into a cell, a 
ScreenTip appears prompting 
you for its arguments, as shown 
in Figure 10.18.
Figure 10.18  A ScreenTip appears to help 
with a function’s arguments.
Figure 10.17  Review these order of operations rules for creating formulas in Excel.
Understanding Functions
A function is a named math operation, such as AVERAGE, SUM, or 
COUNT. Functions are traditionally written in all uppercase, but are not 
case sensitive. A function name is followed by a set of parentheses, and 
within the parentheses are arguments. An argument is a variable that 
tells the function what data to act upon and in what way. Most functions 
have one or more required arguments, along with one or more optional 
ones. For example, the SUM function has one required argument: the 
range of data that you want to sum, like this: =SUM(C1:C10). You can 
optionally specify other data ranges to include by adding more arguments, 
separating each one with a comma. For example, you could add the range 
F1:F10 to the previous example like this: =SUM(C1:C10,F1:F10).
function A named calculation that can be per-
formed in Excel, such as AVERAGE or SUM.
argument A variable in a function, placed in 
parentheses after the function name.

347
Chapter 10: Creating Spreadsheets with Microsoft Excel
Step by Step
Entering a Function
Follow these steps to use Insert Function to create a function:
	 1.	Click the cell into which you want to enter the function. (Select only one cell.)
	 2.	On the formula bar, click the Insert Function icon. The Insert Function dialog box opens.
	 3.	If you know the name of the function you want, select it from the Select a Function list, or select a category and 
then select the function. If you don’t know, type a description of what you want to do, and then click a function in 
the results to read about its purpose below the list. For example, in the following screen I am looking for a func-
tion that will calculate an interest rate, and RATE is one of the functions that Excel recommends.
	 4.	Click OK. The Function Arguments dialog box opens.
	 5.	In each argument box, either fill in a number or a cell reference. The arguments with boldface names are 
required, and the others are optional.
	
	 To find out the meaning of a particular argument, click in its text box and read the description that appears. For 
example, in the following figure, information about the Nper argument appears.
	
	 If you need to check the worksheet to see what cell to reference, you can either drag the dialog box to the side or 
click one of the Collapse Dialog buttons to temporarily shrink the dialog box so you can select the desired cell.
If you need more help than that, such as needing to know what those 
abbreviations stand for in the ScreenTip, you can use the Insert Function 
feature, as described in the following Step by Step.

348
Part III: Microsoft Office
	 6.	When you have finished filling in all the arguments, click OK to complete the function. It is entered into the cell.
Troubleshooting
Fixing Errors in Formulas and Functions
Here are some of the most common errors in 
worksheet formulas and functions:
◾	 Circular reference: Occurs when a cell 
refers to itself, such as =A2+1 being in 
cell A2.
◾	 #VALUE error: Occurs when a formula can’t 
calculate a valid result.
◾	 #NAME error: Occurs when the formula 
references a named range or cell address that is invalid.
You can use the Error Check feature to find and correct these types of errors and more. On the Formulas tab, click 
Error Checking in the Formula Auditing group, and then work your way through the errors it finds, correcting each one.
Understanding Absolute References
When you move or copy cells that contain references to other cells, such 
as a formula that references another cell, those references are relative. 
Excel will change the cell references to match the relative positioning in 
the new location. An example will make this clearer. Suppose, as shown 
in Figure 10.19, you have a function in cell C7 that adds up the amounts 
in cells C3 through C6. The function looks like this: =SUM(C3:C6).

349
Chapter 10: Creating Spreadsheets with Microsoft Excel
Now suppose that you click the Copy button on the Ribbon, click cell 
D7, and click the Paste button on the Ribbon. The formula is copied to 
D7. However, the copied version appears like this: =SUM(D3:D6). Excel 
has assumed that the references to the cells in column C in the original 
formula were context-sensitive. It assumed that what you really wanted 
was to sum the values in the four cells immediately above D7, rather than 
to sum the cells in column C. And, in this case, it is right. That’s called a 
relative reference.
The alternative to a relative reference is an absolute reference, 
which never changes no matter where you copy it. For example, in 
Figure 10.20, cell D4 contains a formula that multiplies the base amount 
in C5 by the bonus percentage in C2. When that formula is copied 
into D6:D8, you want the copies to update the references to the base 
amounts, but you don’t want the reference to the bonus amount to 
change. Therefore, you make the reference to C2 an absolute reference 
by placing dollar signs before the column letter and before the row num-
ber, like this: $C$2. An absolute reference does not change, no matter 
where you copy it.
A mixed reference is a reference that is partially absolute and partially 
relative. For example, $C2 makes the column absolute but keeps the row 
number relative, and C$2 does the opposite.
relative reference In a formula or function, a 
reference to another cell that changes if that for-
mula or function is moved or copied to another cell.
absolute reference In a formula or function, 
a reference to another cell that does not change 
if that formula or function is moved or copied to 
another cell.
mixed reference A reference that is partly 
absolute and partly relative. For example, the row 
number may be relative and the column letter may 
be absolute.
Figure 10.19  The formula in cell C7 is going to be copied to D7.
TIP
You can press F4 to toggle among the reference types (absolute, mixed, and relative) for a selected reference.

350
Part III: Microsoft Office
Figure 10.20  The formula in D5 will be copied to D6, D7, and D8. 
When copied, the reference to the base amount will change for each copy 
(C6, C7, and C8, respectively), but the reference to C2 will not change 
because it is marked as an absolute reference by the dollar signs.

	 3.	 In the function =AVERAGE(A2:A6), what is the argument?
Creating Charts
A chart can help show the meaning of data in a graphical way. For exam-
ple, suppose you were presented with the data shown in Figure 10.21. 
This data represents the sales quantities for several products, but it is 
difficult to gain any useful summary information by browsing it. When 
some of this data is presented in charts, as in Figure 10.22, you can 
immediately discern some useful facts.
chart A graphic that illustrates and summarizes 
worksheet data. Examples include pie chart, line 
chart, and bar chart.
Figure 10.21  This raw data is so detailed that the overall meaning is not obvious.

351
Chapter 10: Creating Spreadsheets with Microsoft Excel
Figure 10.22  When the data from Figure 10.21 is charted, more meaningful information becomes clear. Each chart extracts a different 
meaning from the data.
Types of Charts and Their Uses
Excel can create many types of charts. The pie charts in Figure 10.22, for 
example, are useful for showing the relationship of parts to a whole. In 
each case in Figure 10.22, the whole represents the total sales, and the 
pie slices are proportionally sized to represent each item’s contribution 
toward that whole.
A pie chart is a single-series chart; it plots only one data series and its 
associated labels. The series in the first pie chart in Figure 10.22 is total 
profit per item, and the series in the second pie chart in Figure 10.22 
is units sold per item. Other chart types plot multiple series at once. 
For example, the column chart in Figure 10.23 shows sales quantities 
for three different periods, inviting the reader to compare each item’s 
performance in one month against the other months. Charts can be two-
dimensional, like the ones in Figure 10.22, or three-dimensional, like the 
chart in Figure 10.23. When a chart’s bars run horizontally instead of 
vertically, it is called a bar chart. Variants of both bar and column charts 
are available with cylindrical or pyramid-shaped bars.
Figure 10.23  A column chart can plot multiple data series.
pie chart A chart that represents the data as 
slices of a pie, or parts of a whole.
data series The data representing one row or 
column in the data used to create the chart.
column chart A chart that uses vertical bars to 
represent values.
bar chart A chart that uses horizontal bars to 
represent values.

352
Part III: Microsoft Office
A scatter chart can be useful in seeing a pattern in data, especially data 
from an experiment that is not absolute or repeatable. In Figure 10.24, 
for example, the charted data indicates that there is a relationship 
between bird sightings and the average daily temperature. The straight 
line that runs through the data is a trend line; it shows the overall trend 
that the data represents.
Figure 10.24  A scatter chart helps find trends or patterns in data.
The key that tells what each color or pattern represents (as in 
Figure 10.23) is called a legend. Any chart can have a legend, but some 
charts don’t need one. For example, the pie charts in Figure 10.22 
don’t need legends because the information the legend would provide 
is already in the data label for each slice. The scatter chart shown in 
Figure 10.24 doesn’t need a legend because there is only one data series.
You can create a chart by selecting the data for it and then choosing a 
chart type from the Charts group on the Insert tab. A newly created 
chart appears as a floating object on the active sheet, in its own frame. 
You can drag it around, resize it, or move it to its own Sheet tab.
scatter chart A chart that plots data in patterns 
of dots scattered on the plot area. Scatter charts 
are useful for showing the results of experiments 
or studies where the results may not be repeatable 
or absolute.
trend line The straight line that runs through 
the data, showing the overall trend that the data 
represents.
legend The key that tells what each color or pat-
tern represents.
data label A label telling the exact value of a 
particular data point.
TIP
Placing a chart on its own Sheet tab is a good way of making a complex chart large enough to see clearly 
without obscuring any worksheet cells. It is also useful to place a chart on its own sheet if you want to be 
able to print the chart separately from the data it represents.

353
Chapter 10: Creating Spreadsheets with Microsoft Excel
Stock Charts
A stock chart is a special chart type used to show stock prices. Depending on the sub-type, it contains different 
information. An Open-High-Low-Close chart, for example, shows four values for each date: the stock’s opening 
value, high value, low value, and closing value. You must structure the data in that order in the worksheet before 
selecting the range and making the chart. Another sub-type is High-Low-Close, which contains only three values 
per date. Yet another is Volume-Open-High-Low-Close, which has five values per date.
The most important thing when creating stock charts is to make sure the data appears in the specified order.

Part III: Microsoft Office
Resizing a Chart
Use these steps to resize a chart:
	 1.	Position the mouse pointer on a selection handle on the border of the chart frame, so the pointer becomes a double-
headed arrow. The selection handles on a chart frame are located in the corners and in the center of each side.
	 2.	Drag the border to resize the chart’s frame.
Moving a Chart
Use these steps to move a chart:
	 1.	Position the mouse pointer over the border of the chart, but not over a selection handle.
	 2.	Drag the border to move the chart.
Moving a Chart to a Separate Sheet
Use these steps to move a chart to a separate sheet:
	 1.	Right-click the chart’s frame, and choose Move Chart on the menu that appears.
	 2.	In the Move Chart dialog box, click New Sheet.
	 3.	Type a name for the new sheet, replacing the default name.
	 4.	Click OK.
Adding and Removing Chart Elements
Each chart consists of a number of elements, and each element can be 
selected and formatted separately. Figure 10.25 points out a number of 
chart elements that you should be able to identify and select on a chart.

355
Chapter 10: Creating Spreadsheets with Microsoft Excel
Figure 10.25  Parts of a typical chart.
The totality of a chart (all its elements) is referred to as the chart area. 
When you apply certain formatting to the chart area, the entire chart 
is affected. The portion of the chart where the actual data is plotted is 
known as the plot area. Within the plot area are the data points, which 
are the individual pieces of data, represented by bars, lines, dots, or what-
ever marker the chosen chart type uses. Data points may be divided into 
multiple data series. A data series is all the data points of a certain type, 
such as all the bars of one color on a bar chart.
The large text at the top of the chart is the chart title. The numbers 
along the vertical axis are the vertical axis labels, and the product names 
along the horizontal axis are the horizontal axis labels. The explana-
tory labels along each axis (Units Sold and Products in Figure 10.25) are 
the vertical axis title and horizontal axis title. Depending on the chart, 
they might or might not be helpful. In Figure 10.25, they are mostly 
superfluous because the chart’s title and horizontal axis labels make the 
axes’ purposes clear. A data table shows the data on which the chart 
was based. Data tables are useful if you are going to distribute the chart 
separately from the worksheet on which the data appears.
Each of these elements can be enabled or disabled from the Chart Tools 
Layout tab on the Ribbon, as shown in Figure 10.26. This tab has but-
tons with separate drop-down lists for enabling and configuring each 
element. For example, in Figure 10.26, you can see the choices for the 
Primary Vertical Axis. To turn off an element, you can choose None 
from its menu, or you can select the element on the chart and then press 
the Delete key on the keyboard. Each of the elements has a More com-
mand at the bottom of the menu. You can choose it to open a Format 
dialog box for that element with more controls in it.
chart area The entire chart.
plot area The part of the chart on which the data 
is plotted.
data point A single point of plotted data.
data series The data representing one row or 
column in the data used to create the chart.

at the top of the chart area.
axis labels The text on the axes of the chart that 
shows the values.

Chapter 10: Creating Spreadsheets with Microsoft Excel
Adding and Configuring Data Labels
Use these steps to add a legend to use data labels on a 
chart and to change what is shown on those labels:
	 1.	Select the chart, and then on the Chart Tools Layout 
tab, click Data Labels.
	 2.	Choose one of the presets on the menu, or choose 
More Data Label Options to open the Format Data 
Labels dialog box. This dialog box may look different 
from the one shown, depending on the chart type.
	 3.	In the Label Contains section, mark or clear the check 
boxes to define what you want to appear on the labels.
	 4.	In the Label Position section, select a position.
	 5.	If you want the legend key in the label, mark the 
Include Legend Key in Label check box. If you do this, 
you might not need to have a legend on your chart.
	 6.	If you chose more than one item in Step 3, open the 
Separator drop-down list and choose the way the items 
will be separated.
	 7.	Click Close to close the dialog box.
Changing the Chart Type
To change a chart’s type, select the chart and then click the 
Change Chart Type button on the Chart Tools Design tab. 
In the Change Chart Type dialog box that appears, make 
your selection of one of the types from the list on the left 
and then choose a sub-type from the choices shown in the 
right. See Figure 10.27.
Figure 10.27  Change the chart type from the Change Chart Type dialog box, accessed 
from the Chart Tools Design tab.

358
Part III: Microsoft Office
Switching the Plot Orientation
You can switch the chart between plotting by rows versus 
by columns in your data. For example, in the chart shown 
in Figure 10.25, you could switch the chart so that it shows 
the months along the horizontal axis and uses different 
colored bars for each item. To switch the plot orientation, 
click the Switch Row/Column button on the Chart Tools Design tab.
Formatting a Chart
You can format each element of a chart individually, for precise control 
over its look. You can also format a chart using chart styles, which apply 
preset combinations of formatting to the entire chart at once.
To format individual chart elements, right-click the desired element and 
choose Format element, where element is the element name. For exam-
ple, when you right-click the chart title, the command on the menu is 
Format Chart Title.
You don’t have to close the Format dialog box for the chart element in 
order to do other things in the worksheet or chart. Any changes you 
make to the settings in it are applied immediately; Excel doesn’t wait for 
you to click an OK button as it does in a regular dialog box. Click a cat-
egory on the left and then make your formatting selections on the right. 
The categories depend on the element chosen. Figure 10.28 shows the 
categories for the chart title, for example.
Figure 10.28  Use the Format dialog box for a certain  
element to make changes to its formatting.
To format the entire chart at once, select a chart style from the Chart 
Tools Design tab in the Chart Styles group. Click one of the styles 
shown, or click the More button (
) to open a gallery of styles, as 
shown in Figure 10.29.

Working with Data Tables
In addition to its calculation capabilities, Excel can also store structured 
data. Structured data is data that has a consistent pattern to it, with the 
same type of information in every row, as in a database. For example, in 
Figure 10.30, Excel is shown storing phone numbers.
Converting a Range to a Table
When you are working with 
structured data, you might 
decide to convert the data 
range into a table. A table 
is a group of cells that work 
together as a data storage unit. 
When you convert a range 
to a table, certain extra tools 
become available for working 
with structured data, such as the 
capability to easily sort and filter 
the list using drop-down menus. 
For example, in Figure 10.30, 
notice the down arrows to the 
right of each column heading. 
Clicking one of those arrows 
opens a menu from which you 
can sort and filter the data.

If you don’t want to see the arrows on each field name onscreen, click the Data tab and then click the Filter 
button to toggle them off. Click Filter again to turn them back on again when you need to work with them.
There are two methods of converting a range to a table, as described in 
the following Step by Step. One applies the default table style, and the 
other allows you to pick a table style. After the table has been created, 
you can change the table style from the Table Tools Design tab.
Step by Step
Converting a Range to a Table (Default Style)
Use these steps to convert a range to a table and apply the default table style to it:
	 1.	Select the range.
	 2.	On the Insert tab, click Table.
Converting a Range to a Table (Your Choice of Style)
Use these steps to convert a range to a table and apply your choice of table style to it:
	 1.	Select the range.
	 2.	On the Home tab, click Format as Table.
	 3.	Click the desired style.

Chapter 10: Creating Spreadsheets with Microsoft Excel
Sorting a Table
In a table, each column is known as a field. A field contains a specific 
type of structured data, such as Phone or Address. Each row is a record, 
containing all the fields for a specific instance. To sort means to put 
records into a specific order according to the entry in a certain field. For 
example, you might sort a list by Last Name or by City.
To sort a table, click the down-arrow button to the right of the field by 
which you want to sort, opening a menu, and on that menu, click Sort A 
to Z or Sort Z to A, depending on whether you want an ascending sort 
or descending sort. See Figure 10.31. If the field contains something 
other than text (for example, numbers or dates), the choices of sort order 
may be different. For example, with numeric values your choices might 
be Sort Smallest to Largest or Sort Largest to Smallest.
Figure 10.31  Choose a sort order from the top of the field’s menu.
You can also sort a table in the same way you would sort a range: using 
the Sort buttons on the Data tab. Use the AZ button there for an 
ascending sort or the ZA button for a descending sort, or click the Sort 
button to open a Sort dialog box in which you can set up a multi-field 
sort. A multi-field sort is useful if you have some duplicates in the field 
by which you are sorting, because the secondary field you specify will

Filtering a Table
To filter means to hide certain records according to criteria you specify. 
You can filter a table in several ways:
◾	 If you want to exclude records that contain a certain value in a 
certain field, open a field’s menu, as in Figure 10.31, and at the 
bottom of the menu, clear the check boxes for any entries that you 
do not want to be included.
◾	 If you want to filter to include only records that contain a certain 
value in a certain field, find a record that should be included in the 
results, and in its row, right-click the field by which you want to 
filter. On the shortcut menu that appears, point to Filter and then 
choose Filter by Selected Cell’s Value.
◾	 If you want to filter by criteria you define, open a field’s menu, 
point to Text Filters (or Number Filters, or whatever appears, 
depending on the field data type) to open a submenu, and then 
choose a filtering criterion, such as Equals, Does Not Equal, Begins 
With, or Ends With. Then in the dialog box that appears, specify 
the criterion, as shown in Figure 10.32.
filter To hide certain records according to criteria 
you specify.
Figure 10.32  Define a filter using criteria of your choice.
After you have applied a filter, the down arrow to the right of the field’s 
name changes to a symbol that looks somewhat like a funnel. Clicking 
that symbol opens the field’s menu, the same as if it were the regular 
down-pointing arrow.
To clear a filter, display the Data tab and click Clear, or open the field’s 
menu and choose Clear Filter from Fieldname.
Converting a Table to a Range
You may decide that you want the table to be a regular range again, so 
you can more easily separate the data and work with it in other ways (for 
example, perform calculations on it rather than treating it as structured 
data). When you convert a table back to a range, it keeps the formatting 
applied to it.

Summary
Understanding the Excel Interface
An Excel data file is a workbook and can contain multiple worksheets. You can switch between 
worksheets with the tabs at the bottom of the window. A worksheet is organized in rows and 
columns; the intersection of a row and column is a cell. A cell’s address is its column letter and 
row number, like this: B9. The active cell is the cell that contains the cell selector (the thick black 
outline). You can move the cell selector by clicking or by using the arrow keys.
The formula bar is the bar above the column headings where the contents of the active cell 
appears. If the active cell contains a formula, the formula appears here and the result of the for-
mula appears in the cell.
Moving Around in a Worksheet
To bring different parts of the worksheet into view, use the scroll bars. To move the cell selector, 
use the arrow keys or click the cell you want, or use keyboard shortcuts, as shown in Table 10.1.
To enter data in a cell, select it and then type. To edit a cell’s content, you can replace its entry 
completely or move the insertion point into it and then edit text directly in the cell or in the for-
mula bar. To clear all text from the cell, press the Delete key.
A range is one or more cells selected at the same time. Ranges are described by the address of the 
upper-left and lower-right cells, like this: C3:F10. When a range is not contiguous, the additional 
parts of the range are added with commas, like this: C3:F10,F12:F13. Drag across a range to 
select it, or hold down Shift and use the arrow keys to expand the selection from the active cell.
The fill handle is the small black rectangle in the lower-right corner of the cell selector. Drag it to 
fill the data into adjacent cells from the selected cell(s). The AutoFill feature allows you to fill a 
series, such as days of the week or a sequence of numbers.
Changing the Structure of a Worksheet
You can insert rows or columns as needed. To insert rows or columns, use the Insert button on 
the Home tab. To delete rows or columns, select them and then use the Delete button on the 
Home tab. When you insert individual cells, the surrounding cells must move down or to the 
right. You can specify which action you prefer in the Insert dialog box. The opposite is true when 
you delete cells: Surrounding cells must move up or to the left.
When you merge cells, you make one big data entry area out of the space occupied by multiple 
cells. Use the Merge and Center button on the Home tab to merge contiguous cells.
To move a cell or range, select it and then use the Office Clipboard, as described in Chapter 8, or 
use drag-and-drop. Hold down the Ctrl key if you want to copy rather than move.
Formatting Cells
To resize rows or columns to fit the content (AutoFit), double-click between the row numbers 
or column letters. You can also manually resize them by dragging the divider between the row 
numbers or column letters.
To set the horizontal or vertical alignment for a cell, use the buttons in the Alignment group on 
the Home tab. Vertical alignment is not obvious unless the cell is taller than the text it contains 
requires.

365
Chapter 10: Creating Spreadsheets with Microsoft Excel
Number formats make the numbers in a cell appear in a certain way, such as currency or percent-
age. You can apply number formats from the Number group on the Home tab. Number formats 
also include Date and Time; Excel represents dates and times as numeric values.
All cells have gridlines, which are usually non-printing. You can also apply borders around certain 
cells to set them off from the rest. Use the Borders button on the Home tab, or use the Format 
Cells dialog box. You can also apply a fill (a background color) to cells using the Home tab or the 
Format Cells dialog box.
Entering Formulas and Functions
A formula is a math calculation in a cell. It may refer to other cells for its values, such as =A1+A2, 
or it may refer to literal numbers, such as =2+3. Formulas calculate using the same order of 
operations as in standard math: first exponentiation, then multiplication and division, and finally 
addition and subtraction.
Functions are named calculations such as AVERAGE or PMT. Functions have arguments, which 
are variables placed in parentheses after the function name. When there are multiple arguments, 
they are separated by commas, like this: =PMT(A2,A3,A4).
References to cell addresses in formulas and functions can be absolute, relative, or mixed. An 
absolute reference does not change when the formula is copied or moved; a relative reference 
does change. Absolute references are indicated with dollar signs, as in $A$1. A mixed reference 
uses an absolute reference for one part but not the other, such as $A1 or A$1.
Creating Charts
A chart is a graphic that illustrates and summarizes worksheet data. Many types of charts are avail-
able in Excel, including pie chart, column chart, and bar chart. A pie chart uses only a single 
data series; other chart types can have multiple data series. A scatter chart can help find the trends 
in non-repeatable data. A trend line helps find the overall meaning in the data points.
A legend is a color key that tells what each color in the chart represents. A chart can also have 
data labels on each data point to show its exact value. The entire chart is the chart area. The area 
on which data is plotted is the plot area. The chart title describes the chart’s overall purpose. 
Vertical and horizontal axis labels show the values on axes, and axis titles describe what those 
values mean. A data table shows the values from the worksheet that are plotted in the chart.
To format a chart, you can apply a different chart style, or you can format individual elements by 
right-clicking them and choosing the Format command.
Working with Data Tables
Excel can store structured data in tables. A table is a group of cells that work together as a data 
storage unit. Converting a range to a table makes it easier to sort and filter the data.
In a table, each column is a field and each row is a record. You can sort the data by a particu-
lar column in ascending or descending order. You can also filter, which means to hide records 
according to criteria you specify.

Working with Named Ranges
You can name ranges (and remember, a range can be as small as one cell) in Excel, and use those 
names in formulas. To name a range, select the range and then type a name in the Name box, or 
use the buttons in the Defined Names group on the Formulas tab to create and manage ranges.

369
Chapter 10: Creating Spreadsheets with Microsoft Excel
To try out named ranges, create the worksheet shown in the figure:
Name cell C4 Rate, and name cell C5 Hours. Then enter the following formula in C6: =Rate*Hours. 
If it correctly calculates the result as $800.00, you have named the ranges correctly.
Using Excel to Create Forms
You can use Excel to create business forms that people can fill out onscreen. By combining bor-
ders, fills, and merged cells, you can use Excel’s basic grid to create a variety of form types.
To get started, create a new document using a template that creates a business form, such as an 
invoice. (Search for Invoice when searching for a template.) See how the template uses fills and 
borders, along with varying row heights and column widths. Then start with a new blank docu-
ment and create a form of your own, such as a time card or a change-of-address form.
Exploring Other Number Formats
In a new worksheet, type the same number in cells A1 through A11. Format each of the cells 
using a different number format (from the drop-down list in the Number group on the Home 
tab), and compare the formats. Think of an example scenario in which each format might be 
useful.
Think It Over
Financial Functions
What financial functions would be useful for the average consumer? For example, what functions 
would someone use when comparing mortgage rates? When determining the payments on a per-
sonal loan made to a friend or family member? When calculating the interest earned on an invest-
ment? When determining the future value of an investment at a certain rate of return for a certain 
number of years? Browse the functions available in Excel and decide on the best functions to use 
for each activity.
Making Meaning with Charts
The same data can be used to draw very different conclusions, depending on how it is presented. 
For the chart shown below, how would you modify the chart for the following scenarios?
◾	 You want to make it easier to compare the values for each region from month to month. 
(Hint: What would make it easier to do so visually?)
◾	 You want to minimize the differences between the regions. (Hint: How would you change 
the scale of the numbers on the vertical axis to do this?)
◾	 You want to emphasize teamwork and show how each region contributes to the whole. 
(Hint: What about a different chart sub-type?)

Excel versus a Database
Excel works fine to store a single data table, as you learned in this chapter, but what about when 
your data storage needs are more complicated? Suppose, for example, you wanted to store infor-
mation about customers and their orders. How could you set that up in Excel tables to be most 
useful? Or would it be better to use a relational database application such as Microsoft Access 
(see Chapter 11)?

◽	 Understand how a database differs from a spreadsheet
◽	 Demonstrate how to create databases and tables
◽	 Create queries
◽	 Create and explain the benefits of forms and reports 
A database is a collection of structured data—that is, data in a consistent for-
mat. For example, your address book is a database, as is a catalog of items for sale, 
because the same facts are stored about each instance. In Chapter 10, "Creating 
Spreadsheets with Microsoft Excel," you learned how to store structured data in 
an Excel table, but in many cases the complexity and size of the database make 
Excel an impractical tool for storing and maintaining it. A better tool is Microsoft 
Access, which is also part of some editions of the Microsoft Office suite.
In this chapter, you will learn some basics about databases, and you’ll find out how 
to use Microsoft Access to create and store a simple database.

tured format, with the same facts stored about 
each instance. A database stores data in a way

Understanding Access Databases
Microsoft Access is a popular application for creating and managing small 
to medium-sized databases. This type of application is called a database 
management system (DBMS). A DBMS can not only store data, but 
can also use helper objects such as forms and reports to make the data 
easier to enter, summarize, and understand.
database management system (DBMS) 
An application that helps users create and man-
age databases.
NOTE
Large databases, such as the inventory for a large company, are not stored in consumer-level applications 
like Access. Instead, they are stored using powerful, multi-user DBMSs produced by companies like Citrix and 
Oracle. Managing these large databases is a professional job, and database administrators make a career of 
this work.
Database data is stored in one or more tables. You worked with some 
basic tables in Excel in Chapter 10, in the section “Working with Data 
Tables.” At its most basic level, a table is a collection of fields into which 
users can input records. Recall from Chapter 10 that a field is a type of 
information to be collected, such as Name or Phone, and that a record is 
a stored instance, such as an individual person, place, or thing.
An Access table can be displayed in Datasheet view, which makes its 
data appear in a two-dimensional grid that looks a lot like an Excel table. 
See Figure 11.1. As in an Excel table, the field names appear across the 
tops of the columns and the data records appear in rows beneath those 
column headings.
You can enter new data into the first empty row at the bottom of a table 
datasheet, as you would enter it in an Excel table or worksheet. There is 
another option, however; in Access, you can create forms for data entry. 
A form makes the process of data entry more user-friendly by display-
ing only one record at a time, as shown in Figure 11.2. The form itself 
contains no data; it merely funnels data into the table(s) with which it is 
associated.
One of the benefits of using Access is that you can have two (or more) 
tables in the same data file, and you can create a relationship between 
the tables. For example, you could have Customers and Orders tables for 
your business. In the Customers table, you could store the full contact 
information for each customer, and in the Orders table, you could store 
information about each order placed. The Orders table could have a 
Customer ID field that has a relationship to the Customer ID field in 
the Customers table, so that each order is tied to a particular customer’s 
record. You could also have a table called Order Details that contains 
each line-item of each order, with an Order ID field that is related to the 
Order ID field in the Orders table. Figure 11.3 shows these tables and 
relationships. Creating relationships between tables is very useful, and is 
one of the main benefits of using Access rather than Excel for a multi-
table database.
Datasheet view A view of a table in which the 
table’s data appears in a structured grid or rows 
and columns.
form A database helper object that simplifies 
data entry to presenting a user-friendly form in 
which to enter data.
relationship A connection between two tables 
based on a shared field.

Figure 11.2  A form makes data entry into a table more user friendly.

374
Part III: Microsoft Office
Figure 11.3  This database has three related tables.
In Chapter 10, you learned how to use Excel to sort and filter data in a 
table in a basic way, but in Access, the sorting and filtering capabilities 
are much stronger. You can create a query, which is a set of saved specifi-
cations for sorting, filtering, and other data manipulation. A query’s 
results display in a datasheet, like a table does, but may include a subset 
of the fields and/or records from the table on which it is based. A query 
can also be used to combine the data from multiple related tables. For 
example, looking back at the relationships in Figure 11.3, you could 
create a query that shows a record for each order placed on a certain 
date and the postal code to which it was shipped. The order number 
and order date would come from the Orders table, and the postal code 
would come from the Customers table.
A query can help you find key information quickly, such as in the preced-
ing example, but the results it generates will be presented in a plain-
looking datasheet. When you want to present data in a more attractive 
format, you can generate a report. A report takes data from a table or 
query and lays it out for printing with a title and page headers/footers. 
Reports can also optionally summarize data rather than presenting the 
full set of records. Figure 11.4 shows a sample report.
query A saved set of specifications for manipulat-
ing data in one or more tables.
report A saved definition of a layout for present-
ing database data in printed form.

Using Access for Web-Based Applications
Access databases are not just for personal computer use; you can also make them available on web pages. For exam-
ple, you can use Access Services, which is a component of SharePoint, to build a web application that others can use 
to enter and view data. For more information, read the article and watch the videos at http://office.microsoft.
com/en-us/access-help/build-an-access-database-to-share-on-the-web-HA010356866.aspx.

Creating Databases and Tables
A database file starts with one or more tables. A table is the only data-
base object that can hold data, so you must construct your tables before 
you can do any data entry or create any other objects. In the following 
sections, you will learn how to start a new database file, find your way 
around the Access 2010 interface, and create the tables you need.
Creating a Database
When you start Access, the New screen appears, as shown in Figure 11.5, 
and from here you can start a new database based on a template or start a 
new blank database. You can also click Open to open an existing data-
base, or choose one of the shortcuts to recently opened database files.

376
Part III: Microsoft Office
Figure 11.5  Start a new database or open an existing one.
For the purposes of this chapter, we will start with a new blank database. 
Doing so will give you a chance to create all the database objects from 
scratch, so you will learn how to do it. You may choose to start with one 
of the templates when you work with Access on your own in the future.
Step by Step
Creating a New Blank Database
Use these steps to start a new database:
	 1.	On the New page in Backstage view, click Blank Database (Figure 11.5).
	
	 If you do not see this page, click the File tab to open Backstage view and then click New in the navigation pane at 
the left.
	 2.	In the File Name box, change the generic name there (Database1) to a file name of your choice.
	
	 (Optional) If you want to save the database file somewhere other than your default Save location for Office docu-
ments, click the folder icon to the right of the File Name box and select a different location.
	 3.	Click Create. The database is created, and a new blank table appears in Datasheet view.
You will learn what to do with this new table as this chapter progresses. 
You don’t have to do anything with it for now. Just leave it onscreen.

377
Chapter 11: Managing Databases with Access
NOTE
You might notice that in the Access application’s title bar, Database (Access 2007-2010) appears. This refers 
to the format in which the database file is stored. Access 2007-2010 is the most recent format available; 
some databases may be stored in earlier Access formats, such as 2003 or 2000, for backward compatibility.
Understanding the Access Interface
Microsoft Access has the same basic elements as other Office applica-
tions, such as the Ribbon, the status bar (with View buttons in the right 
corner), and a File menu that opens Backstage view.
Along the left side of the screen is the navigation pane, which contains 
a list of all the database objects. You can create a variety of database 
objects, including tables, forms, reports, and queries, and you can switch 
among them by selecting them from this navigation pane. Right now, as 
shown in Figure 11.6, there is only one object there: Table1, the auto-
matically created table placed there when you created the database file.
navigation pane The pane along the left side 
of the Access window that lists and organizes 
database objects.
Figure 11.6  The Access 2010 application window with a table displayed in Datasheet view.
Because a table is open in Figure 11.6, the Table Tools contextual tabs 
appear: Fields and Table. These tabs contain commands for working with 
the table. Other contextual tab sets may appear when you are working 
with other object types.

378
Part III: Microsoft Office
Figure 11.6 shows the table in Datasheet view, which displays the fields 
in columns and the records in rows. In Figure 11.6, there are no records 
yet, and only one field: ID. The ID field is automatically generated; it 
will contain a unique value for each record entered into the table. To 
switch to another view, such as Design, click its button in the status bar, 
or click the View button on the Ribbon.
NOTE
The View button on the Ribbon changes depending on what view is currently displayed; in Figure 11.6, since 
you are in Datasheet view, it shows Design view.
Creating a Table in Datasheet View
You can create or modify a table in Datasheet view or in Design view. In 
Datasheet view, you can define the fields in a basic way, while still look-
ing at the table in its familiar row-and-column format.
When you create a new blank database, it starts out with a new table in 
Datasheet view, as you saw earlier. Use this table as your first table, nam-
ing and structuring it as needed with the fields you want. You can add 
more tables later from the Create tab.
When you are finished modifying a table’s structure, you must save it. 
Use the Save button in the Quick Access toolbar, or use the Save com-
mand on the File menu. You will be prompted to save it when you close 
the table or switch to another view of the table. Give the table a descrip-
tive but short name, such as Customers, Orders, or Inventory.
Step by Step
Creating a New Table
Use this procedure to start a new table (other than the one that Access creates automatically with a new database file):
◾	 On the Create tab, click Table to create the table in Datasheet view.
	
	
OR
◾	 On the Create tab, click Table Design to create the table in Design view.

Follow these steps to save a table:
	 1.	Click the Save button on the Quick Access toolbar. If you have not saved 
the table before, the Save As dialog box opens.
	 2.	In the Save As dialog box, type a name for the table.
	 3.	Click OK.
Renaming a Table
Follow these steps to rename a table:
	 1.	Close the table if it is open, and then right-click the table’s name in the navigation pane and choose Rename.
	 2.	Type the new name and press Enter.
Creating a Table in Design View
Design view provides more options and more control over the fields in 
your table. Many database professionals prefer to work with table struc-
ture and properties in Design view because it shields them from the data 
so they can focus on the table itself.
Design view A viewing mode for a database 
object that enables you to modify the object’s 
structure and properties.
NOTE
When you switch from Datasheet view to Design view, you will be prompted to save the table if you haven’t 
already done so.
Step by Step
Displaying a Table in Design View
Do any of the following to display a table in Design view.
1.	If the table is already open in Datasheet view, right-click its tab and choose Design View.
2.	Right-click the table’s name in the navigation pane and choose Design View.
3.	Click the Design View button at the right end of the status bar.
In Design view, the field names appear in the top section of the screen, in 
the order they appear in the datasheet. The data type appears to the right 
of each field name. You can modify the field names and data types freely 
here. The Data Type column uses a drop-down list from which you can 
select the field type, as shown in Figure 11.7. Table 11.1 summarizes the 
available field types and their recommended uses.

Field Type
Recommended Uses
Comments
Text
Fields that contain only text, or a 
mixture of text and numbers
This is also used for fields that contain numbers that are 
treated as text, such as postal codes and phone numbers.
Memo
Fields that will need to be able to 
hold a large amount of text 
This field type can hold up to 65,536 characters, but it lacks 
some of the benefits of a text field.
Number
Fields that contain a general numeric 
value (not currency)
Use this field for quantities and other numbers that you might 
need to calculate.
Date/Time
Fields that report a date and/or time
This field type is technically a numeric type, but it formats the 
numbers as dates or times. 
Currency
Fields that contain monetary values
This type is similar to Number except it uses the currency sym-
bol and two decimal places in its default format.
AutoNumber
Use this type for only one field in 
a table; it automatically assigns a 
unique numeric value to each record
You don’t enter data in this field; Access enters it for you. Use 
this field when each record should have a unique identifier but 
you don’t care what it is. 
Yes/No
Fields that contain logical conditions 
such as True/False, Yes/No, or On/Off
Users will select from a two-item drop-down list when entering 
data into this field.
OLE Object
Fields that store external content 
from other programs, such as an 
Excel workbook or Word document
Use for attaching Office documents to records, such as attach-
ing a person’s resume to his or her personnel file. The advan-
tage of OLE Object over Attachment is that you can more easily 
open and edit the document if you use the OLE Object type.
Hyperlink
Fields that store a web address or an 
email address
By using the Hyperlink field type, you make the address click-
able in Datasheet view.
Attachment
Fields that store external files from 
other programs
The advantage of Attachment over OLE Object is that it sup-
ports more file formats and you can have more than one 
attachment per record.

In Design view, you can enter a Description for each field. This descrip-
tion does not appear in most other views (including Datasheet view), so 
you can use it for your own internal notes about the field.
In the lower part of Design view are the field properties for the active 
field. You will learn about these in the next section.

Calculated
Fields that store the calculated val-
ues from one or more other fields in 
the same table
You don’t enter data into this field; Access populates it auto-
matically based on the calculation you specify.
Lookup 
Wizard
Fields that should display a drop-
down list of choices from a list you 
create or generate from another table
This is not a true field type, but a means of accessing the 
Lookup Wizard feature for setting up a lookup. 
Troubleshooting
Using Lookups
One of the biggest headaches for database administrators is that users make typographical errors when entering 
and editing data. One way to minimize the typos is to use lookups for fields. A lookup is a menu of choices that 
users select from; they don’t have to type the entry, so they don’t make typing errors. Lookups are useful for fields 
in which there are a fixed number of valid values, such as Marital Status. You can choose Lookup Wizard as the 
field type to open a series of dialog boxes that walk you through the process of creating a lookup.

Chapter 11: Managing Databases with Access
Modifying Field Properties
Each field has properties that determine how it looks (such as how 
numbers are formatted, if it’s a Number field), what kind of data it 
accepts (for example, a character limit), whether it is required, and what 
its default value is, if any. Different types of fields have different proper-
ties. Numeric fields can be assigned a format, for example, that dictates 
whether there will be any helper symbols (like currency or percentage) 
and how many decimal places will show.
To set a field’s properties in Datasheet view, as shown in Figure 11.8, 
click anywhere in that field’s column and then use the buttons on the 
Table Tools Fields tab to change the properties as desired.
Figure 11.8  Set field properties in Datasheet view.
To set a field’s properties in Design view, as in Figure 11.9, select the 
field at the top part of the screen, and then modify the fields on the 
General tab in the Field Properties area at the bottom of the screen.
Figure 11.9  Set field properties in Design view.
Setting the Primary Key
The primary key for a table is the field used to distinguish one record 
from another. All the other fields in the table can have the same value 
in multiple fields except this one. Access recommends that you have a 
primary key defined in each table, and if you try to save the table without 
choosing one, a warning appears.
primary key The field that is unique for all 
records in the table, by which records in the table 
will be referenced in other tables.
Reordering Fields in Design View
	 1.	Click the selector (the blank gray box) to the left of the field name to select that row in the field list.
	 2.	Drag and drop the field up or down to a different position.

Part III: Microsoft Office
Creating a Relationship between Tables
Creating relationships between tables has many benefits. It allows you to 
run queries and create reports that pull information from multiple tables, 
for example, and to create data entry forms that enter data into multiple 
tables simultaneously.
A relationship usually links the primary key field in one table with the 
corresponding foreign key in another table. A foreign key is a field that 
contains the same information as its related primary key field but is not 
unique for each record. For example, in the Customers table, the ID 
field is the primary key, and each record has a unique ID. In the Orders 
table, the Customer field—the foreign key—contains customer ID 
numbers that correspond to those in the Customers table. In the Orders 
table, multiple records can have the same value for that field, because 
a single customer might place multiple separate orders. This is called a 
one-to-many relationship.
You can create relationships between tables in the Relationships window, 
as shown in Figure 11.10. In Figure 11.10, there are three tables. In two 
of them, the primary key field has a relationship with the corresponding 
foreign key field in the other table. Notice the tiny 1 and ∞ symbols on the 
line. These symbols are present because this relationship enforces referential 
integrity in the one-to-many relationship between the tables. Referential 
foreign key A field that has a relationship to the 
primary key field in another table.
one-to-many relationship A relationship in 
which the connected field is unique in one table 
and not unique in the other table.
referential integrity A requirement that 
the data in related tables be matched, so that 
an entry in the “many” side of the relationship 
(the foreign key) must have a corresponding 
entry in the “one” side of the relationship (the 
primary key).
Step by Step
Setting the Primary Key
Follow these steps to specify which field should be the primary key:
	 1.	Display the table in Design view.
	 2.	Select the field that should be the primary key.
	 3.	On the Table Tools Design tab, click the Primary Key button to select it. A key symbol appears to the left of the 
field name.
TIP
If there are no unique fields in your table that would be suitable to be the primary key, consider adding an ID 
field for this purpose. Set the ID’s field type to AutoNumber so you don’t have to assign a value to it for each 
record.

385
Chapter 11: Managing Databases with Access
integrity means that the data on the “many” side must have a corresponding 
value on the “one” side. In Figure 11.10, that means that there can be no 
orders placed for customers who do not appear in the Customers table, and 
there can be no order details entered for orders that do not appear in the 
Orders table. You can create relationships without referential integrity if you 
choose, but your database will not be as error-proof that way.
Figure 11.10  A simple example of database relationships.
Referential integrity has two options: Cascade Update and Cascade 
Delete. Cascade Update changes the entry in the foreign key table when 
the entry in the primary key table changes. For example, if a customer’s 
ID number changes in the Customers table, her ID will be automatically 
updated for each of her records in the Orders table.
Cascade Delete deletes the entry in the foreign key table when the entry 
in the primary key table is deleted. For example, suppose a customer is 
removed from the Customers table for some reason (for example, the 
customer dies, or asks to be removed). If Cascade Delete is enabled, all 
records in the Orders table from previous orders that customer placed 
would be deleted.
Step by Step
Creating a Relationship between Tables
Follow these steps to create a relationship:
	 1.	Ensure that the fields to be related have the same data type.
Note: For Step 1, AutoNumber should be considered a Number data type. If you are creating a relationship between an 
AutoNumber field and a foreign key field, that foreign key field’s type must be set to Number.
	 2.	On the Database Tools tab, click Relationships. The Relationships window opens.

386
Part III: Microsoft Office
	 3.	If the table(s) you want to work with do not appear, click the Show Table button. Click a table to show, and click the 
Add button. Repeat this for each table you want to show, and then click Close.
	 4.	Drag and drop the primary key field from one table onto 
the foreign key field that matches it in the other table. 
The Edit Relationships dialog box opens.
	 5.	(Recommended but optional) Mark the Enforce Referential 
Integrity check box.
	 6.	(Optional) Mark the Cascade Update and/or Cascade 
Delete check boxes if appropriate.
	 7.	Click Create to create the relationship.
Deleting a Relationship between Tables
Follow these steps to remove a relationship:
	 1.	When viewing the Relationships window, click the line between the two tables to select it.
	 2.	Press the Delete key on the keyboard. A confirmation box appears.
	 3.	Click Yes.
Closing the Relationships Window
Follow these steps to close the Relationships window:
	 1.	On the Relationship Tools Design tab, click Close. A box appears asking if you want to save the changes.
	 2.	Click Yes.

387
Chapter 11: Managing Databases with Access
Entering Data in a Table
It is a good idea not to enter any data until you have finalized the tables 
and their relationships, because changing a table’s fields and properties 
may change the rules for what data a field will accept. For example, if 
you change a field’s type from Text to Number, text-based data in that 
field will become invalid.
You can enter data directly into a table in Datasheet view. Click in the 
first cell in the first blank row of the datasheet, and start typing. Press 
Tab to move to the next field, just like you did in Excel in Chapter 10, 
or press Shift+Tab to go back to the previous field. When you reach the 
final cell in the row, pressing Tab moves to the beginning of the next 
row and starts a new record. If you don’t want to tab all the way to the 
end of the row, just click the mouse to move the insertion point outside 
of that row, or click the Save button in the Records group on the Home 
tab. Records are saved automatically when you navigate away from them; 
you don’t have to click the Save button after each one to save it.
NOTE
Saving a table is needed only when making structural changes to the table itself, not when entering or 
changing data.
There are several ways to delete a record. Select it (by clicking the selec-
tion box, which is the gray blank box to the left of the record), and then 
do any of the following:
◾	 Press the Delete key.
◾	 Right-click the record and choose Delete Record.
◾	 On the Home tab, in the Records group, click the Delete button.

Creating Queries
A query is a view of a table that shows it in a different way. A query can 
hide certain fields, hide certain records, show records sorted in a certain 
order, and more. Queries are useful for cutting out the unimportant data 
to find an answer to a question, and for extracting data that helps make 
sense of a situation. For example, a query could answer the question 
“What orders did customer X place in January?” or “What were the top 
10 best-selling products in the Northeast region?” A query can also be 
used to make the data from two or more related tables appear together in 
a single datasheet. That query can then be used as the basis for a report, 
allowing you to create reports using data that spans multiple tables.

388
Part III: Microsoft Office
You can create a query using the Query Wizard, which walks you step-
by-step through the process of creating a query, or you can use Design 
view. This chapter briefly explains both.
Creating a Query with the 
Simple Query Wizard
The Simple Query Wizard is a good place to start for your first query 
because it makes the process very simple. The Simple Query Wizard 
enables you to create a query that includes fields from one or more related 
tables, and that includes only certain fields. It can either show all the 
records (a detail query) or show a summary of them (a summary query).
The drawback to the Simple Query Wizard is that it does not allow 
you to filter the records. In other words, it shows all the records (or a 
summary of all the records). You could not, for example, show only one 
customer, or only one date range of orders.
detail query A query that shows all records in 
the dataset.
summary query A field that totals or summa-
rizes the data from the records rather than listing 
each record.
NOTE
Queries are powerful and can do a lot more than what’s described in this brief chapter. The queries covered in 
this chapter are select queries, which means they select certain fields and records from one or more tables. 
However, there are other types of queries that can actually change the values of certain fields and even delete 
records. Queries can also be used to summarize data.
select query A query that selects certain fields 
and records from one or more tables.
Step by Step
Creating a Detail Query with the Simple Query Wizard
Follow these steps to create a detail query with the Simple Query Wizard:
	 1.	On the Create tab, click Query Wizard. The New Query dialog box opens.
	 2.	Click Simple Query Wizard and click OK. The Simple Query Wizard runs.
	 3.	Open the Tables/Queries list, and choose the table 
from which to pull fields.
	 4.	In the Available Fields list, click a field you want 
to include and click the > button to add it to 
the Selected Fields list. Do this for each field to 
include. Or, to add all the fields from the query, 
click the >> button.
	 5.	If you want another table’s fields to be included, 
repeat Steps 3 and 4. Otherwise click Next to 
continue.
	 6.	If you included one or more fields that can be 
calculated, such as a Number or Currency field, a 
screen appears asking if you want a detail or sum-
mary query. Choose Detail, and then click Next.
	 7.	If desired, change the default name of the query 
in the What Title Do You Want for Your Query? 
text box.
	 8.	Click Finish. The query opens in Datasheet view. The query’s name appears in the navigation pane.

389
Chapter 11: Managing Databases with Access
Creating a Summary Query with the Simple Query Wizard
Follow these steps to create a query with the Simple Query Wizard:
	 1.	On the Create tab, click Query Wizard. The New Query dialog box opens.
	 2.	Click Simple Query Wizard and click OK. The Simple Query Wizard runs.
	 3.	Open the Tables/Queries list and choose the table from which to pull fields.
	 4.	In the Available Fields list, click a field you want to include and click the > button to add it to the Selected Fields 
list. Do this for each field to include. Or, to add all the fields from the query, click the >> button.
Note: Make sure that you include at least one field that can be calculated, such as a Number or Currency field.
	 5.	If you want another table’s fields to be included, repeat Steps 3 and 4. Otherwise click Next to continue.
	 6.	When prompted whether you want a Detail or Summary query, click Summary, and then click the Summary Options 
button. A list of all the calculable fields in the 
selected list appears, with Sum, Avg, Min, and Max 
check boxes for each one.
	 7.	Mark the check boxes for the calculations you want 
to appear in the query.
	 8.	Click OK, and then click Next.
	 9.	If you included any Date/Time fields, you are asked 
how you want to group the dates in your query. 
Choose any grouping as desired, and then click Next.
	10.	If desired, replace the generic query name with a 
different name. Then click Finish. The query results 
appear in Datasheet view. For any calculations you 
requested, a calculated field (column) appears in 
the datasheet.
Creating a Query in Design View
When you create a query in Design view, you have full control over the 
query. You can filter out certain fields and/or records by the criteria you 
specify.
In Query Design view, the top section shows the fields from the tables 
that you add to the grid. The bottom section is the Query By Example 
(QBE) grid; you drag individual fields here and then set properties to 
configure how they will appear in the query results. For example, in 
Figure 11.11, four fields are included: Company (from the Customers 
table), Order Date (from the Orders table), and Quantity and Unit Price 
(from the Order Details table). The query is sorted first by Company 
and then by Order Date, and filtered to show only orders with a date 
between 3/1/2015 and 3/31/2015. Table 11.2 explains the syntax 
used to define the filtering criteria.
NOTE

Step by Step
Creating a Query in Design View
Follow these steps to create a detail query in Design view:
	 1.	On the Create tab, click Query Design. A blank QBE grid opens, 
and the Show table dialog box opens.
	 2.	Click a table from which you want to use fields, and click Add. 
Repeat for each additional table you also want to use fields 
from, and then click Close to close the dialog box.
	 3.	Drag a field from a table to the QBE grid at the bottom of the 
screen. Do this for each field you want to include, in the order 
they should appear in the query results.
Note: If you make a mistake in the order, you can drag a field to repo-
sition it. Select it by clicking the thin gray bar above the field name in 
the QBE grid, so that the column for that field turns black, and then 
drag to the left or right.
	 4.	To sort by a certain field, click in the Sort line for that field, so that a drop-down list 
arrow appears. Open the drop-down list and choose Ascending or Descending.
Note: If more than one field has sorting enabled, data will be sorted from left to right; the 
leftmost field marked for sorting will be the primary sort.
	 5.	To filter by a certain field, enter the criteria in the Criteria line for that field. Table 11.2 
summarizes the way to enter different types of data.
	 6.	(Optional) If you want to hide a certain field from the results, clear the check box in its Show line. You might filter 
by a certain field but then hide that field from the results, for example.
	 7.	Click the Run button on the Query Tools Design tab to see the query results, or switch to Datasheet view.

Setting Program Options
Access has a large array of customizable options, both for the individual database you are working with and for the 
program in general. Click File ➪ Options to open the Access Options dialog box and explore what’s available. Here 
are just a few highlights:
Current Database page:
◾	 On the Current Database page, if you want a certain form to open when the database opens, select it from 
the Display Form drop-down list. You can create forms with buttons on them that users can click to open 
specific forms and tables, creating a very user-friendly environment.
◾	 On the Datasheet page, you can change the default font size for text that appears in the datasheet. For 
example, you could increase the font size for someone with limited vision.
◾	 On the Object Designers page, you can change the defaults for new fields, such as choosing a different field 
type or default field size.
◾	 On the Client Settings tab, you can change the way Access behaves when users are entering and editing 
data. For example, you can choose what happens when they press Enter or an arrow key and whether or not 
to display a confirmation box when performing certain activities.
Step by Step
Creating a Quick Form
Follow these steps to quickly create a form for a table:
	 1.	In the navigation pane, select the table on which to base the form.
	 2.	On the Create tab, click Form. The form opens in Layout view.
	 3.	Switch to Form view to start using the form, or edit the form in Layout or Design view as needed.
There are three views for forms:
◾	 Form view: This is the view in which you use the form to work 
with the data. The form itself is not editable in this view.
◾	 Layout view: This is an editable view of the form that looks almost 
exactly like Form view: what you see is what you get (WYSIWYG). 
In this view, you can add and remove fields and other basics, and 
the existing fields move over to make room or close up the space 
when something is deleted. Layout view is simple for beginners.
◾	 Design view: This is a fully editable view of the form, on which you 
can make the full range of changes. You can drag fields around to 
position them exactly here, add calculated controls, and much more 
beyond the scope of this chapter. Design view provides the detailed 
level of control that professionals want to have. Figure 11.14 shows 
the form from Figure 11.13 in Design view.

Another easy way to create a form is the Form Wizard, which you can access from the Forms group on the 
Create tab. The Form Wizard enables you to select only certain fields to include on the form, and also allows 
you to choose among several layouts and formatting styles.

395
Chapter 11: Managing Databases with Access
Whereas forms are designed to be used onscreen, reports are designed to 
be printed. Forms and reports have much in common in terms of how 
they are created and edited. Reports also have Layout and Design views 
as two different ways of modifying them: Layout for simple edits that a 
beginner can make, and Design for precise control.
To create a report, use the Report button in the Report group on the 
Create tab to create a default-styled report with all the fields from the 
selected table or query, or try out the Report Wizard for a few more choices.
For reports, a Report view and a Print Preview view are both avail-
able. Report view is designed for reading the report onscreen, whereas 
Print Preview view is designed for seeing how the report will look when 
printed, but they are very similar.

Summary
Understanding Access Databases
Microsoft Access is a database management system (DBMS). It stores not only data but also 
helper objects such as forms, reports, and queries. Tables and query results are typically displayed 
in Datasheet view, which looks like a spreadsheet. A query is a saved specification for sorting and 
filtering the data in one or more tables. By creating relationships between tables, you can connect 
the data from multiple tables, such as connecting customers to orders.
Creating Databases and Tables
A database file starts with one or more tables; a table is the only database object that can store data. 
The tables and other objects in the database appear in the navigation pane. You can create a table 
in either Datasheet view or Design view. A table consists of one or more fields, each of which has 
a field type (text, number, and so on) that dictates what data can be placed in it. You can adjust the 
properties of a field to further define it, such as assigning a default value or making it required.
The primary key is the field that is used to distinguish one record from another. When creating 
relationships between tables, the primary key field in one table is usually related to a foreign key 
in another table. You can optionally enforce referential integrity on a relationship to prevent data 
from being entered that does not work with the relationship.
You can enter data directly into a datasheet. Click and start typing, and use Tab to move to the next 
field, just like in Excel. You don’t have to save a record; it is saved automatically when you leave it.
Creating Queries
A query is a view of a table that shows it in a different way, such as hiding certain fields or records 
and sorting the records in a certain order. One way to create a query is with the Simple Query 
Wizard. It enables you to select a subset of fields from multiple tables and show either details or a 
summary of the data (a detail query or summary query, respectively).
You can also create a query in Design view. You can add tables, and then select fields from those 
tables. You can choose to sort by certain fields, and enter criteria to filter the record set.
Creating Forms and Reports
Forms provide data entry assistance by displaying records in a more attractive and accessible 
onscreen format. Use the Quick Form feature by clicking the Form button on the Create tab. You 
can work with forms in Form view (for data entry), Layout view (for simple form changes), and 
Design view (for more complicated form changes).
A report is designed to be printed. You can create a Quick Report with the Report button on the 
Create tab, or try out the Report Wizard for more choices.

Normalization
Part I: A database is said to be normalized when certain design requirements are met. Use the web 
to research database normalization and write a one-page paper that explains the first two normal-
ization rules: First Normal Form (1NF) and Second Normal Form (2NF).
Part II: Plan a database (table names, field names, and relationships) in which 1NF and 2NF are 
enforced, and explain why you made the choices you made.
Form and Report Editing
After creating a form or report, modify it in Layout view. Make at least three edits, including 
reordering the fields, changing the title, and changing the font color of the data labels. Close it 
without saving your changes.
Next, do the same thing to the same form or report, but do it in Design view. Make the same edits 
you made before.
Write a one-page paper or an email discussing the experience. Which view did you find easier to 
use? Which view would you probably use in the future to make changes to forms and reports?
Northwind Traders
Microsoft provides a sample database called Northwind that contains many different objects along 
with example data. It is a good database to look through to see the scope of what can be accom-
plished with Access. To see it, start a new database using the Northwind template. Examine several 
of each type of object (table, form, query, and report). Make notes about what you see and what 
types of objects you might be interested in incorporating in your own databases.

Careers in IT
Presentation Specialist
Some companies supply professionally designed 
PowerPoint presentations to their salespeople to use dur-
ing their sales calls. If the company is large enough and 
the presentation needs great enough, a full-time person 
may be employed to create the presentations, update 
them, create customized versions of them, and organize 
all the slides into slide libraries from which salespeople 
can pick out the slides they need for each sales call. If 
you enjoy working with both text and graphics and have an 
eye for what makes graphical content attractive, you might 
enjoy being a presentation specialist. This career requires 
at least a high school diploma and specialized training in 
PowerPoint, such as Microsoft Office Specialist PowerPoint 
classes and certification.

Building a Basic Presentation
The PowerPoint interface is in some ways very similar to that of Word 
and Excel. It contains the same type of Ribbon, and a File menu with the 
same types of commands on it.
PowerPoint’s default view is Normal view, and it’s divided into three 
main panes, as shown in Figure 12.1. At the left is the Slides/Outline 
pane. It’s called that because there are two tabs at the top of this pane: 
Slides and Outline. The Slides tab shows thumbnail images of each slide 
in the presentation; the Outline tab shows a text-based outline of all the 
text from the title and content placeholders on the slides. The large cen-
ter pane is the Slide pane. This is where you create and edit the content 
of the active slide. (Only one slide is active at a time.) At the bottom is 
the Notes pane, where you can type notes to yourself or other authors 
or deliverers of the presentation; the notes don’t display to the audience, 
and they don’t print unless you specifically indicate that you want them 
printed.
As in Word and Excel, you can change to different views on the View 
tab, or by using the view buttons on the status bar. Each view is designed 
for a certain range of activities. For example, Slide Sorter view, shown 
in Figure 12.2, is designed for viewing and arranging all the slides in the 
presentation. There are other views too for special situations, such as 
Notes Pages view for editing speaker notes.
Normal view The default PowerPoint view, in 
which you can edit the content of individual slides.
Slides/Outline pane The pane on the left side 
of the screen in Normal view in PowerPoint, show-
ing thumbnail images of the presentation (on the 
Slide tab) or a text outline (on the Outline tab).
Slide pane The main editing pane for a slide in 
Normal view in PowerPoint.
Notes pane The pane in which you type speaker 
notes in Normal view in PowerPoint.
Slide Sorter view The PowerPoint view in which 
you can browse thumbnail images of all the slides 
in the presentation and easily rearrange them.

Entering and Editing Text
In PowerPoint, everything you enter (text, graphics, and so on) appears 
in a movable frame on a slide. You can’t type anything directly onto a 
slide the way you type directly into a Word document.
When you start a new blank presentation, it has a single slide in it, one 
that uses the Title Slide layout. A layout is an arrangement of place-
holders on a slide. The Title Slide layout contains two placeholders: 
one for the presentation title, and one for the presentation subtitle. See 
Figure 12.3. Click in a placeholder and type the desired text.

Figure 12.3  The Title Slide layout contains two placeholders.

407
Chapter 12: Creating Presentation Graphics with PowerPoint
To add another slide, click the New Slide button on the Home tab. 
This creates a slide with a layout called Title and Content. As the name 
implies, it has two placeholders: one for a title, and one multi-purpose 
placeholder that can accept any type of content. See Figure 12.4. In 
the content placeholder are six icons representing the six most com-
mon types of graphical content; you can click one of those icons to start 
inserting that content, or you can click in the content placeholder and 
then type text into it. A content placeholder can hold only one type of 
content at a time, so if you put text in it, for example, you can’t also put 
a graphic into it; you must either place the graphical content manually 
on the slide or switch to a different layout that contains more than one 
content placeholder.
Figure 12.4  The Title and Content layout contains a multi-purpose placeholder.
Changing a Slide’s Layout
The layout determines what placeholders appear on the slide and in what 
positions. Each template comes with a variety of preset layouts, and you 
can also create your own. To switch an existing slide to another layout, 
click the Layout button on the Home tab, and then click the desired 
layout from the gallery, as shown in Figure 12.5.

408
Part III: Microsoft Office

TIP
To create a custom layout, switch to Slide Master view (from the View tab) and then click Insert Layout. Use 
the Insert Placeholder button’s menu to insert the desired placeholders on the layout there.
Inserting and Deleting Slides
As you learned in the earlier section, “Entering and Editing Text,” one 
way to insert a new slide is to click the New Slide button on the Home 
tab. Doing so places a new slide immediately after the active slide. The 
active slide is the one that appears in the Slide pane, the one that is cur-
rently editable. You can change which slide is active by clicking a differ-
ent slide in the Slides/Outline pane.
Here are some other ways to create a new slide:
◾	 Press Ctrl+M to insert a new slide after the active slide.
◾	 On the Home tab, click the arrow below the New Slide button to 
open a gallery of layouts. Click the desired layout to create a new 
slide based on it.
◾	 On the Slides tab of the Slides/Outline pane, click between two 
slides to place a horizontal line between them. Then press Enter to 
create a slide that uses the same layout as the slide above it.
◾	 On the Outline tab of the Slides/Outline pane, click to place the 
insertion point at the beginning of the title line for a slide, and 
then press Enter to create a new blank slide immediately before 
that slide.
active slide The slide that currently appears in 
the Slide pane in Normal view in PowerPoint.

409
Chapter 12: Creating Presentation Graphics with PowerPoint
◾	 To promote a paragraph on an existing slide to be its own slide, 
position the insertion point at the beginning of that line on the 
Outline tab of the Slides/Outline pane and press Shift+Tab, or 
right-click the paragraph and choose Promote.
◾	 Right-click any part of any slide in the Slides/Outline pane and 
choose New Slide from the shortcut menu.
To delete a slide, select it in the Slides/Outline pane, and then do either 
of the following:
◾	 Right-click the slide in the Slides/Outline pane and choose Delete 
Slide.
◾	 Press the Delete key on the keyboard. (If working in the Outline 
pane, make sure all the text for the whole slide is selected before 
pressing Delete.)
Reordering Slides
You can reorder slides from either Normal view or Slide Sorter view, but 
most people find Slide Sorter view easier. From Slide Sorter view, drag 
and drop the slides where you want them. Use the Zoom controls on the 
status bar as needed to zoom in so you can see the slide content better or 
zoom out so you can see more slides at once.
From Normal view, you can reorder slides by dragging them up and 
down on the list in the Slides/Outline pane. If working on the Slides 
tab, drag the thumbnail images as you could in Slide Sorter view; the 
only difference is that the slides appear in one column in Normal view. If 
working on the Outline tab, click the icon to the left of the slide’s title to 
make sure the entire slide is selected before dragging up or down.
TIP
You can also right-click a selected slide in the Slides/Outline pane and then click Move Up or Move Down to 
rearrange slides.

Formatting a Presentation
When formatting a presentation, it’s important to maintain consistency 
between slides as much as possible, for a polished and professional look. 
It is possible to apply separate manual formatting to certain text or 
objects, as you learned to do in Chapter 9 in Word, but you should have 
a specific reason for doing so, such as to make certain text stand out or 
emphasize a point.
The following sections explain several ways to change the formatting of 
the presentation as a whole.

410
Part III: Microsoft Office
Setting the Slide Size and Orientation
You can set a size in inches for the presentation’s slides, but when you 
deliver an onscreen presentation, the slide fills the entire screen, regardless 
of the slide size. That said, it’s more useful to think about slide size as a ratio 
of width to height (an aspect ratio) rather than as a literal measurement.
The aspect ratio to choose depends on the aspect ratio of the monitor on 
which the presentation is going to be shown. For a standard monitor (like 
an older-style CRT or a standard-definition TV), choose a ratio of 4:3. 
For a widescreen monitor, choose a ratio of 16:9. (See Figure 12.6.)
Step by Step
Changing the Slide Size and Orientation
Use these steps to change the slide size:
	 1.	On the Design tab, click Page Setup. The Page Setup dialog box opens.
	 2.	Open the Slides Sized For drop-down list and select a size or aspect ratio.
	
	 OR
	
	 Enter an exact width and height in the Width and Height text boxes.
Figure 12.6  Aspect ratios for standard versus widescreen monitors.
If you are planning to distribute the presentation on paper rather than 
showing it onscreen, slide size does make a difference. You can specify 
an exact height and width for the slides, or you can choose from among 
many presets for different paper types, such as Letter, A3, Overhead, and 
Banner.
You can also set a slide orientation. By default, presentations are in 
Landscape orientation, which means the slides are wider than they are 
tall. You can reverse that by changing to Portrait orientation for special 
situations, such as when you are presenting on a monitor that is rotated 
90 degrees.

411
Chapter 12: Creating Presentation Graphics with PowerPoint
TIP
If you just want to change the orientation, and not the size, you can use the Slide Orientation button on the 
Design tab.
Changing the Presentation Theme
You learned about themes, theme fonts, and theme colors in Chapters 8 
(“Understanding Microsoft Office 2010) and 9 (“Word Processing with 
Microsoft Word”). Recall that a theme is a preset combination of format-
ting that you apply to an entire document, workbook, or presentation. 
At a minimum, a theme contains font choices, color choices, and effect 
choices. When applied to a presentation in PowerPoint, the theme also 
supplies other formatting information, such as a background image (in 
some cases) and a set of slide layouts with placeholders positioned in 
certain spots on each layout. Because different layouts are associated with 
different themes, applying a theme can change the presentation’s look in 
more dramatic ways than it does in Word and Excel files. For example, 
Figure 12.7 shows the same slide with four different themes applied to it.
Figure 12.7  A theme can change the placement and appearance of content on a slide.
	 3.	Under Orientation, click the Portrait or Landscape button for Slides.
	 4.	Click the Portrait or Landscape button for Notes, Handouts & Outline.
	 5.	Click OK.
TIP
If you don’t like the background graphics in a theme but you like the other features of it, apply the theme and 
then on the Design tab, mark the Hide Background Graphics check box.
If you like the colors from one and the background from another, feel 
free to mix up theme colors, fonts, and effects. First apply an overall 
theme and then use the Colors, Fonts, or Effects button on the Design 
tab to select different settings in one or more of those areas.

412
Part III: Microsoft Office
Step by Step
Changing the Theme
Use these steps to choose a different theme, colors, fonts, and/or effects for a presentation:
	 1.	On the Design tab, click the More button in the Themes group to open the full gallery of themes.
	 2.	Scroll through the list of themes, and click the desired theme.
	 3.	(Optional) Click the Colors button, and choose a different set of theme colors.
	 4.	(Optional) Click the Fonts button, and choose a different set of theme fonts.
	 5.	(Optional) Click the Effects button, and choose a different set of theme effects.
Working in Slide Master View
Slide Master view is the view in which you can view and modify the 
slide layouts on which you base individual slides. The slide master is the 
overall guide for slides using the currently selected theme. Subordinate to 
the slide master are multiple layout masters, each of which defines the 
exact content and positioning for a particular layout (such as the Title and 
Content layout you worked with earlier). To enter Slide Master view, as 
shown in Figure 12.8, click Slide Master on the View tab. To exit Slide 
Master view, click the Close Master View button on the Slide Master tab.
In Slide Master view, thumbnail images appear in the navigation pane 
on the left. The image at the top of the pane is the slide master itself. 
Changes made to it affect all layouts based on it. Below the slide master 
are the individual layout masters. Masters that contain content placehold-
ers that accept text include multiple levels of bulleted lists. Changes you 
make to one of these levels affects all paragraphs that have that level in 
the hierarchy of a slide. For example, make changes to the topmost bul-
leted list item to change first-level bulleted paragraphs.
Slide Master view The PowerPoint view in 
which you can make changes to the slide master.
slide master The template slide that controls 
the appearance and repeated elements for all 
slides in a presentation.
layout master The template slide that controls 
the appearance and repeated elements for all 
slides that use a certain layout in a presentation.
Troubleshooting
Theme Applies Inconsistently
If certain text doesn’t conform to the font and/or font size settings supplied by the theme, that text might have had 
manual formatting applied to it earlier. Manually formatted text doesn’t change when you choose a different theme 
or theme fonts. To remove manual formatting from text, select the text and press Ctrl+spacebar, or click the Clear 
All Formatting button (
) in the Font group of the Home tab.

413
Chapter 12: Creating Presentation Graphics with PowerPoint
TIP
The Footer, Date/Time, and # text boxes on slide masters and layout masters determine where the footer, date, 
and slide number elements will appear if they are enabled. (They’re not enabled by default.) Rather than typing 
text into these text boxes in Slide Master view, just position the text boxes where you want that information to 
appear on the slide. Then after exiting Slide Master view, on the Insert tab, click Header & Footer, and enable 
the desired repeating elements in the dialog box that appears.
Some of the changes you might make to a slide master or layout master 
include:
◾	 Changing text font, size, color, and attributes for certain paragraph 
levels. Use the tools on the Home tab’s Font group, as you learned 
in Chapters 8 and 9.
◾	 Moving or resizing the placeholders, the same way you learned to 
move and resize objects in Chapter 8.
◾	 Adding a graphic or text box that should repeat on every slide. Use 
the Insert tab to insert various types of content.
Figure 12.8  Slide Master view.

414
Part III: Microsoft Office
Creating and Inserting Content
PowerPoint slides can accept many types of content, so you can use 
PowerPoint to showcase information in a variety of forms. For example, 
a slide can include tables, graphics, videos, and charts, in combination 
with explanatory text.
Each content type can be inserted manually on a slide using the com-
mands on the Insert tab. When you manually place an object on a slide, 
it appears in the center of the slide, and from there you can move and 
resize it as needed. When you apply different layouts to the slide, the 
manually placed content does not move.
You can also put content into content placeholders. When you do this, 
the content becomes part of the slide’s layout, and if you change to a dif-
ferent layout that positions the content placeholder differently, the item 
moves to the new position. If the new layout does not have a placeholder 
appropriate to that type of content, the content is converted over to a 
manually placed object and becomes disassociated with the layout.
Inserting a Text Box
Besides the text placeholders on slides, you can also manually place text 
boxes on a slide. The content of these text boxes does not appear in 
the outline (on the Slides/Outline pane), so limit such text boxes to 
non-essential text, such as an identifying label near a graphic or a tip or 
caution.
You can insert a text box in two ways; each results in a text box with dif-
ferent settings:
◾	 On the Insert tab, click Text Box and then click where you want 
the text box to begin. Then start typing. The text box expands 
horizontally as needed for the text you enter. It doesn’t start a new 
line unless you press Enter (or Shift+Enter) to force it.
◾	 On the Insert tab, click Text Box and then drag a rectangle where 
you want the text box. The box takes on the width you specified. 
As you type, if the cursor reaches the edge of the text box, it moves 
to the next line.
Quick Review
	 1.	 What is the difference between a slide master and a layout master?
	 2.	 How do you apply a different theme to a presentation?
	 3.	 How do you change the aspect ratio of the presentation’s slides?
◾	 Adding or removing placeholders. To add a placeholder, use the Insert 
Placeholder button in the Master Layout group on the Slide Master 
tab. To remove a placeholder, select its border and press Delete.

415
Chapter 12: Creating Presentation Graphics with PowerPoint
Changing Text Box Settings
If the text box isn’t behaving the way you want, you 
can change its settings. Right-click the text box’s 
border and choose Format Shape. In the Format 
Shape dialog box, click Text Box in the category list 
at the left, and then change the text box’s settings 
in the controls that appear. For example, the Wrap 
Text in Shape check box toggles on/off the capability 
for text to wrap to the next line when it reaches the 
edge of the text box. You can also set the text box 
to Autofit, which shrinks the font size in a text box 
or text placeholder to make it continue to fit at the 
box’s current size.
Troubleshooting
Step by Step
Inserting a Table in a Content Placeholder
Use these steps to place a table in a slide’s content placeholder:
	 1.	On the slide, click the Insert Table icon in the content placeholder. The Insert 
Table dialog box opens.
	 2.	Specify a number of columns in the Number of Columns text box.
Creating a Table
A table in PowerPoint is a grid of rows and columns, with cells at their 
intersections. You type text into cells to organize the text into an orderly 
grid. Tables in PowerPoint are much like tables in Word, except somewhat 
simpler. To insert a table, click the Insert Table icon in a content placeholder 
box, or use the Table button on the Insert tab to insert a table manually. If 
you use the Table button, you can choose from among several methods, just 
like in Word, including dragging across a grid of squares to specify table size 
and drawing a table with the mouse pointer as a pencil tool.
You can move, resize, and format a text box just like any other object in 
an Office application. Chapter 8 covered object placement, sizing, and 
formatting.

Part III: Microsoft Office
	 3.	Specify a number of rows in the Number of Rows text box.
	 4.	Click OK to insert the table.
	 5.	Type text in the table as desired.
Inserting a Table without a Placeholder
Use these steps to place a table on a slide that may not have a content placeholder available to hold a table:
	 1.	Display the slide on which you want to create a table.
	 2.	On the Insert tab, click the Table button.
	 3.	Drag across the grid to select the number of rows and columns you want, and then release the mouse button to 
complete the table.
Inserting Audio and Video Clips
An audio clip is a file that contains sound, such as music, narration, or 
a sound effect. A video clip is a file that contains motion video. You can 
insert audio and video clips directly onto a slide, so that they play auto-
matically or when clicked as part of the slide show.
audio clip A file that stores a sound, narration, 
or music.
video clip A file that stores motion video.
TIP
You can also incorporate sound clips in other ways too. For example, you can assign a sound clip to a transi-
tion or animation effect, so that the sound happens whenever that event occurs. You can also attach a sound 
to a graphic object on the slide, so that when that object is clicked, the sound plays.

417
Chapter 12: Creating Presentation Graphics with PowerPoint
There are three different ways to insert an audio clip on a slide:
◾	 You can record your own audio 
clip from within PowerPoint. To 
use this method, on the Insert tab, 
click the down arrow under the 
Audio button and then click Record 
Audio. See Figure 12.9.
◾	 You can insert an audio clip from 
a file that you already have. To use 
this method, on the Insert tab, click 
the Audio button’s face (or click 
the down arrow below the button 
and then choose Audio from File) 
to open the Insert Audio dialog box 
and then choose the desired clip.
◾	 You can locate an audio clip using the Clip Art feature. Office.
com provides hundreds of audio clips you can use royalty-free. To 
use this method, on the Insert tab, click the down arrow below 
the Audio button, and click Clip Art Audio. Then search for an 
audio clip the same way you search for clip art (as described in 
Chapter 9).
Regardless of the method used for inserting the clip, you can work with 
it the same way after insertion. The clip appears on the slide, as shown in 
Figure 12.10, and controls for it appear on the Audio Tools Format and 
Audio Tools Playback tabs on the Ribbon. The Audio Tools Format tab 
contains commands for making the clip’s icon appear a certain way, and 
the Audio Tools Playback tab contains commands for controlling how 
and when the clip will play.
Figure 12.10  Control an audio clip’s playback and appearance.
Figure 12.9  Record an audio clip 
to include in the presentation.

418
Part III: Microsoft Office
Inserting a video clip is similar to inserting an audio clip except you 
don’t have the option of recording new ones from within PowerPoint. 
Click the down arrow below the Video button on the Insert tab to 
choose whether you want a clip from a file or a clip from the Clip Art 
collection. You can also click the Insert Media Clip icon in a content 
placeholder.
You can control whether a clip should play automatically when the slide 
appears or wait until it is clicked to play. You can find that setting on the 
Playback tab (Audio Tools Playback or Video Tools Playback, depending 
on the clip type). Open the Start list and choose Automatically or On 
Click.
Inserting Pictures
Inserting pictures in PowerPoint is similar to inserting them in Word, 
which you learned about in Chapter 9. To insert a manually placed 
image, use the Picture button to insert from a file you already have, or 
use the Clip Art button to find an image from Microsoft’s clip art col-
lection, both on the Insert tab. Or, to fill a placeholder, click the Insert 
Picture or Clip Art icon in the placeholder box.
Drawing Shapes
Using the Shapes feature, you can draw your own vector-based lines 
and shapes on a slide in PowerPoint, for all kinds of reasons. You might 
construct your own simple drawings out of these lines and shapes, or you 
could use them as accents for the other content on the slide, such as an 
arrow to point out a certain area of a photo or chart.
To draw a line or shape, click the Shapes button on the Insert tab, as 
shown in Figure 12.11, and then drag across the slide to draw the line 
or shape. You can move, resize, and format lines and shapes just like any 
other content. You can also type text into shapes, creating impromptu 
text boxes.
Shapes The drawing feature in Office applica-
tions that enables users to create vector-based 
lines and shapes.
TIP
A text box is the same element as a drawn rectangle shape, and can be formatted in all the same ways. To 
convert a rectangular text box to some other shape with text in it, select the shape and then on the Drawing 
Tools Format tab, in the Insert Shapes group, click the Edit Shape button, point to Change Shape, and select 
one of the drawing shapes.

419
Chapter 12: Creating Presentation Graphics with PowerPoint
Figure 12.11  Choose a line or shape and then drag on the slide to create it.
Inserting a Chart
To start a chart in PowerPoint, use the Insert Chart icon in the content 
placeholder, or use the Chart button on the Insert tab.
Excel’s charting feature is integrated with Excel, so that when you start 
a new chart in PowerPoint, an Excel window opens into which you 
can enter the data for it. In the Excel window, some placeholder data 
appears, as shown in Figure 12.12. A blue outline appears around the 
range that will be charted; you can drag the small triangle in the lower-
right corner of that outlined range to change the range area to have 
more or fewer rows or columns included. Change the generic labels in 
the sample data as needed.
Figure 12.12  Excel opens when you start constructing a chart in PowerPoint.

420
Part III: Microsoft Office
Formatting a chart works the same in PowerPoint as it does in Excel. 
Refer to Chapter 10, “Creating Spreadsheets with Microsoft Excel,” for 
information about chart formatting.
Creating SmartArt
SmartArt combines the visual interest of a graphic with the information 
of text. This type of object is available in multiple Office applications, but 
it is especially well suited for PowerPoint because of the focus on deliver-
ing information conceptually. Figure 12.13 shows several examples of 
SmartArt graphics. SmartArt not only can present text, but also can show 
relationships between ideas, illustrate processes, and outline an organiza-
tion’s structure.
You can use the Insert SmartArt icon in a content placeholder to start 
some SmartArt, or you can use the SmartArt button on the Insert tab. 
You can also convert existing text (for example, an existing bulleted 
list on a slide) to SmartArt by selecting the text and then clicking the 
Convert to SmartArt Graphic button in the Paragraph group of the 
Home tab.
SmartArt A tool in Office applications that 
combines shapes with text listings to create infor-
mative and visually interesting graphics.
Step by Step
Inserting a Chart
Use these steps to place a chart on a PowerPoint slide:
	 1.	Click the Insert Chart content placeholder icon, or on the Insert tab, click Chart. The Insert Chart dialog box 
opens.
	 2.	Select the chart type on the left, and then the subtype on the right, and then click OK. Excel opens (refer to 
Figure 12.12).
	 3.	Replace the generic data with your own data and then close the Excel window.
	
	 If you later need to reopen the Excel window to edit the data further, click the Edit Data button on the Chart Tools 
Design tab.

After creating the SmartArt, you can modify it using the tools on the 
SmartArt Tools Design tab. You can add and remove shapes, apply a 
different layout, reorder shapes, and choose a different style. On the 
SmartArt Tools Format tab, you can choose formatting for individual 
shapes to make one or more stand out from the rest.
For easier text editing, you might choose to use the text pane. To display 
it to the left of the graphic, on the SmartArt Tools Design tab click Text 
Pane, or click the arrow button on the left edge of the graphic’s frame. 
See Figure 12.14.
	 2.	Select the category from the left and then select the layout from the right pane. You can change layouts later if 
desired.
	 3.	Click OK. The graphic appears on the slide.
	 4.	Type text into the text placeholders.

Applying Transitions and Animations
Transitions and animations add movement to an otherwise static presen-
tation. A transition is a movement effect between one slide and another; 
an animation is a movement effect of a particular object on a slide.
Applying Transitions
To select a transition, first select the slides to which it should apply. You 
can do this in the Slides/Outline pane of Normal view or in Slide Sorter 
view. Or, if you want to affect only one slide, just make it the active slide. 
(If you want to apply the same transition to all the slides, apply it to one 
slide and then click Apply to All.)
Then, on the Transitions tab, click the desired transition in the 
Transition to This Slide group. You can click the More button to open 
the gallery for more choices. Some transitions have options you can set. 
If the chosen effect has options available, the Effect Options button 
becomes active, and you can click it to choose an option. For example, 
many of the transitions have directional options, such as in Figure 12.15.
Figure 12.15  Select a transition from the Transitions tab.
In the Timing group, you can control the timing of the transition. The 
Duration setting indicates how long the transition will take to execute, 
from start to finish. Transitions are set by default to Advance Slide On 
Mouse Click, but you can optionally set an After value to make the slide 
advance automatically after a certain amount of delay.
Applying Animations
Each slide has only one transition, so it’s simple to set up, as you saw 
in the preceding section. Animations, however, are more complicated 
because you can have multiple animations per slide. You can animate 
transition A movement effect between one slide 
and another.
animation A movement effect of an object on 
a slide.

425
Chapter 12: Creating Presentation Graphics with PowerPoint
each object separately, and a single object can have multiple animations 
applied to it.
You can apply four types of animations to an object:
◾	 Entrance: Controls when and how the object enters the slide.
◾	 Emphasis: Controls what the object does between its entrance and 
its exit.
◾	 Exit: Controls when and how the object exits the slide.
◾	 Motion path: Technically a type of emphasis effect but set up 
separately, a motion path moves an object along an invisible line (a 
path) that you set up, at a time and speed that you specify.
To sequence the animations on a slide, you can display the Animation 
pane. (Click the Animation Pane button on the Animations tab to do 
so.) On the Animation pane, you can move animation effects up or down 
on the list to change their order, and you can set options and timings for 
each effect individually. The different animation types appear in different 
colors in the Animation pane: green for entrance, yellow for emphasis, 
red for exit, and gray for motion paths. Figure 12.16 shows a sequence 
of animation effects that includes at least one of each of those.
Figure 12.16  You can set up a whole sequence of animation effects for individual items 
on each slide.

Step by Step
Adding an Animation Effect
To add an animation effect, follow these steps:
	 1.	Select the object to animate.
	 2.	On the Animations tab, click Add Animation.
	 3.	Click the animation effect you want (and then skip the rest of these steps).
	
	 OR
	
	 If you don’t see the effect you want, choose the More command that matches the type of animation you want 
(for example, More Entrance Effects).
	 4.	Select the effect from the dialog box that appears. (The name of the dialog box varies.)
	 5.	Click OK.

427
Chapter 12: Creating Presentation Graphics with PowerPoint
Adjusting the Animation’s Timing
To adjust the animation timing, follow these steps:
	 1.	In the Animation pane, click the animation event to change.
	 2.	On the Animations tab, in the Timing group, open the Start drop-down list and choose a start setting (With 
Previous, After Previous, or On Click).
	 3.	In the Duration box, enter the number of seconds for the duration. The lower the number, the more quickly the 
animation happens.
	 4.	In the Delay box, enter the number of seconds of delay between the previous event and this animation. The previ-
ous event is the item above this one in the Animation pane, or if none, the previous event is the transition to the 
current slide from the previous one.
Changing an Effect’s Options (Basic)
To change the animation event, follow these steps:
	 1.	In the Animation pane, click the animation event to change. If the Animation pane does not appear, click the 
Animation Pane button on the Animations tab.
	 2.	On the Animations tab, click Effect Options and then select an option. The options vary depending on the effect.

428
Part III: Microsoft Office
Changing an Effect’s Options (Advanced)
For more advanced options to change an animation event, follow these steps:
	 1.	In the Animation pane, click the animation event to change.
	 2.	On the Animations tab, click the dialog box launcher in the Animation group, opening a dialog box for the anima-
tion. The dialog box name varies.
	 3.	On the Effect tab, set any options as needed. For 
example, you can choose an accompanying sound effect.
	 4.	Click the Timing tab, and adjust the timing of the ani-
mation effect. These are the same controls as on the 
Animations tab but with a few more options available.
	 5.	Click OK.

Chapter 12: Creating Presentation Graphics with PowerPoint
When in Slide Show view, PowerPoint shows navigation icons in the 
lower-left corner of the screen. The icons appear semitransparent and 
dimmed until you move your mouse over them; then they become brighter. 
Figure 12.17 shows the navigation icons. They include Previous and Next 
buttons for moving between slides, and also two icons that open menus:
◾	 Pen: Opens a menu of 
choices for changing the 
mouse pointer to various 
types of pens and pointers. 
You can use the pen tool 
to draw on the slide using 
your mouse to empha-
size certain points. See

Locking Down Slide Show View
If you leave a presentation running on an unattended computer, you might want to take steps to prevent unauthor-
ized users from stopping the presentation. You can disable some of the ways that normally work to control the 
presentation in order to make the computer more secure. For example, you could give users only the mouse to 
navigate with and then prevent the right-click menu and the navigation icons from appearing, so all the users could 
do would be to click to move forward.
For basic security, on the Slide Show tab, click Set Up Slide Show and then choose Browsed at a Kiosk as the 
show type. This disables Presenter View and also sets 
the show to loop continuously until Esc is pressed. If you 
hide the keyboard so only you can press Esc, the show 
remains on.
For even more security, click the File tab and click Options, 
and then click Advanced. Scroll down to the Slide Show 
section of the options, and clear the Show Menu on Right 
Mouse Click and Show Popup Toolbar check boxes.

Summary
Building a Basic Presentation
Presentation graphics are visual aids used in public speaking activities, and PowerPoint is an 
application that creates them. PowerPoint’s default view is Normal view, in which you can edit 
slides individually. It contains a Slides/Outline pane, a Slide pane, and a Notes pane. Slide 
Sorter view is good for rearranging slides.
Each slide has a layout, which is an arrangement of placeholders. You can choose a different lay-
out from the Layout button on the Home tab. You can also choose a layout when inserting new 
slides with the New Slide button.
The active slide is the one that appears in the Slide pane. You can change which slide is active by 
clicking a different one in the Slides/Outline pane.
To reorder slides, drag their thumbnail images in the Slides/Outline pane (Slides tab) or in Slide 
Sorter view.
Formatting a Presentation
Slide size and orientation are set for the entire presentation, not for individual slides. Set these 
on the Design tab. Choose an aspect ratio of standard (4:3) or widescreen (16:9) for on-screen 
viewing.
You can apply a different theme from the Design tab’s Themes group. You can then optionally 
choose a different set of theme fonts and theme colors.
Slide Master view enables you to modify the slide master and the layout masters. Choose Slide 
Master view from the View tab. The slide master is the topmost slide in the navigation pane in 
Slide Master view, and the smaller thumbnails beneath it are its layouts.
Creating and Inserting Content
In addition to the text placeholders, you can manually insert extra text boxes, but their text will 
not appear in the outline. Use the Text Box button on the Insert tab. You can click and begin typ-
ing, or you can drag to create a text box of certain dimensions.
To create a table, use the Table button on the Insert tab or use the Insert Table icon in the con-
tent placeholder. To insert audio clips, use the Audio button on the Insert tab. To insert a video 
clip, use the Video button, or use the Insert Media Clip icon in the content placeholder.
To insert a picture from a file, use the Picture button on the Insert tab or the Insert Picture icon 
in a content placeholder. To insert clip art, use the Clip Art button on the Insert tab or the Clip 
Art button in a content placeholder.
To draw shapes, click the Shapes button on the Insert tab, choose a shape and then drag on the 
slide.
To insert a chart, use the Chart button on the Insert tab or the Insert Chart icon on a content 
placeholder. Excel opens when you insert a chart, and you enter the data in the worksheet that 
appears for it.
SmartArt combines the visual interest of a graphic with the information of text. Use the SmartArt 
button on the Insert tab or the Insert SmartArt icon in a content placeholder to start a new piece 
of SmartArt, or use the Convert to SmartArt button on the Home tab to convert an existing list.

432
Part III: Microsoft Office
Applying Transitions and Animations
A transition is a movement effect between slides; an animation is a movement effect of an 
object on a slide. They have separate tabs from which to create them: the Transitions tab and the 
Animations tab. There are four types of animation effects: Entrance, Emphasis, Exit, and Motion 
Path. You can manage multiple animations on a single slide using the Animation pane.
Presenting a Slide Show
To enter Slide Show view, you can click the Slide Show View button in the status bar or choose 
From Beginning or From Current Slide from the Slide Show tab.
To move between slides, you can click to move forward, or use the navigation icons in the lower-
left corner of the slide, or the arrow keys on the keyboard. Right-click and choose Go to Slide to 
jump to a particular slide. Press Esc to end the slide show.

Inserting Content from Word
Create an outline in Word using Outline view and then open it in PowerPoint. After doing that, 
close the file, and start a new blank Presentation. On the Home tab, click the down arrow below 
New Slide, select Slides from Outline, and choose the Word document to import slides from it. 
Was there any difference between the two methods of importing Word content?
Think It Over
Lots of Layouts
Suppose you need to create a presentation that has many different arrangements of content. Do 
you think it would be advantageous to create a lot of different layouts? Or would it be better to 
stick to just a few layouts and manually move the placeholders on each slide? Explain the pros and 
cons of each.
Sound Effects
What would you think of a speaker who used a lot of different wacky sound effects in his presenta-
tion? Would you find it entertaining, or would you think he was unprofessional? Would the topic 
of the presentation make any difference?
Consistency or Variety?
Which would be more appealing for an audience to view: a presentation that was consistent in its 
use of themes, layouts, and transitions, or a presentation that mixed all of those things up, with 
different slide background colors, different transition effects, and different fonts on every slide? 
Explain your answer.

Learning objectives
◽	 Identify communications networks in daily life
◽	 Distinguish between types of networks
◽	 Identify common types of network hardware
◽	 Understand the Internet and choose a connection method
◽	 Troubleshoot common network and Internet connectivity problems
When computing first began, each computer was separate, and data was moved 
between computers only with difficulty. Today, however, computers connect to 
both local and global networks that make information sharing easy, whether you’re 
sharing data with your brother’s computer in the next room or with a file server 
halfway around the world.
This chapter explains the basics of modern networking, both large and small net-
works, both wired and wireless, and both private and public. You will learn how 
networks are structured, how network resources are identified, and how network 
security helps keep your data safe. You’ll also learn how to troubleshoot some 
common network-related problems.

Our Connected World: Communication 
Systems
Networking is everywhere, and many of our everyday activities are 
enabled or assisted by computer networking, even the activities that 
might not on the surface seem to have anything to do with it. For 
example, when you withdraw funds at your local bank branch, the bank 
verifies your account balance on the bank’s main server at the home 
office. When you buy an item at your local discount chain store and pay 
for your purchase with a credit card, the cash register’s software checks 
a credit card verification server to make sure your card is valid before 
charging your purchase. It then sends the information to the store’s 
internal inventory management system via the local network. The local 
server then sends an updated inventory report to the company’s web 
server, so that someone ordering from the store’s website will know that 
the item is no longer in stock. When you call your mother on your cell 
phone on the way home to tell her about your purchase, your call goes 
through the wireless network for your cell phone provider.
Let’s start out this chapter by looking at some of the large-scale networks 
that make up our connected world.
Public Telephone and Data Networks
The first worldwide network ever created was the telephone network, 
predating computers by many decades. This network is an example of a 
circuit-switched network. It works by creating a point-to-point circuit 
between the two locations, as shown in Figure 13.1. The telephone 
network creates a pathway between the two points, and that pathway 
remains open for the duration of the phone call. Networks can be public 
or private. The public telephone system—the whole of the world’s 
circuit-switched telephone networks—is known as the public-switched 
telephone network (PSTN).
circuit-switched network A network that 
creates a point-to-point connection between 
locations that remains open for the duration of the 
communication.
public switched telephone network 
(PSTN) The worldwide network of circuit-switched 
telephone lines.
Figure 13.1  A circuit-switched network maintains a single constant line of communication.
In contrast, computer networks are packet-switched networks. A com-
munication channel does not remain open between two points for an 
entire conversation; instead, the data is broken up at the sending end 
into small packets, each with an electronic envelope around it that states 
the source and the destination, and sent individually to the receiver. 
Depending on the network traffic, each packet may take a different 
route to the destination, but when they arrive they are unpacked and 
­reassembled into the original message, as in Figure 13.2.
packet-switched network A network that 
transfers data by breaking it up into separately 
transferred packets.

441
Chapter 13: Networking and Internet Basics
Figure 13.2  A packet-switched network allows each packet to find the best route to the destination  
independently.
The Internet
The Internet is the world’s largest network. It is not owned or main-
tained by any one company; instead, it is a cooperative effort among 
many companies and governments, with multiple standards organizations 
managing the rules for its operation. The Internet is a packet-switched 
network with a worldwide addressing system. The Internet uses various 
protocols (rules) that all participating computers have standardized on, 
so that services like the web, email, and instant messaging work the same 
everywhere. Most companies and individuals don’t connect directly to the 
Internet; instead, they connect to an Internet service provider (ISP), 
which in turn connects to the Internet. For example, if you have cable 
Internet at home, your ISP is your cable provider.
The Internet is based on a protocol stack (a set of protocols) called 
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). 
TCP/IP provides a common set of standards by which data can be sent 
and received. It is used not only on the Internet, but in most private 
networks today as well. One of the key features of TCP/IP is IP address-
ing, which is a means of uniquely identifying each connected computer 
on the network by a numeric value.
Private Digital Networks
Many companies maintain high-speed connections between their locations. 
They can do so by leasing a line running their own cables, or using the exist-
ing pathways of the Internet. Using the Internet is the most cost-effective 
method, but not the most reliable method, because the connection can be 
affected by Internet traffic problems and connections that other companies 
control and maintain.
Using the Internet is also not very secure; it’s an open system, and data 
being sent and received can easily be snooped. To tighten the security 
when using the Internet as a conduit, many companies use a software 
technology called virtual private networking (VPN). VPN technol-
ogy creates a secure, tamper-resistant data tunnel between two points on 
the Internet, so that sensitive information can be exchanged securely, as 
in Figure 13.3. A VPN allows an employee who is working outside of 
the company’s main building to connect to any of the internal network 
resources, just as if he or she were in the building.

created cooperatively by multiple companies, 
governments, and standards organizations.

something is done. In a computer context, it refers

to physically carry the data.
Satellite Data Networks
A satellite is a transmitter/receiver unit that orbits the Earth, more than 
22,000 miles up. Satellites are in geosynchronous orbit (that is, their orbit 
is synchronized with the Earth’s orbit), so they do not appear to change 
in position compared to any location on Earth. A satellite contains tran-
sponders, which are two-way radios that communicate with stations on the 
ground. Satellites are used to quickly send information between two points 
on Earth that are physically separated by a great distance. For example, when 
the Olympics are held in one country, satellites are used to broadcast the 
video of each competition nearly instantly to every other country. Satellites 
are also used for services like satellite radio (Sirius/XM, for example) and sat-
ellite TV broadcasts such as DirecTV and Dish Network (see Figure 13.4). 
Some Internet services also use satellites to provide Internet access to areas 
where other high-speed connection technologies are not available.

chronous orbit with the Earth.

Chapter 13: Networking and Internet Basics
Cell Phone Networks
Cellular telephone companies have their own data networks, using a 
combination of satellites, cables, and on-ground towers with transmitters 
and receivers on them. Calls connect to the cell tower that is closest to 
the phone’s current location, 
and that cell tower then taps 
into the larger telecommuni-
cations network via satellites 
and cables.
Some cell phone networks 
can also be used to access the 
Internet (see Figure 13.5). 
You can access the Internet on 
a smartphone (a cell phone 
that includes computer func-
tionality), and you can tether 
(connect) a smartphone to a 
computer and use the phone 
as a modem to allow the com-
puter Internet access.

puter applications and Internet access capability.

Internet access.

Figure 13.5  Cell phone networks can carry 
both voice and data.
Tethering a Computer to a Smartphone for Internet Access
If your phone has Internet access, you can probably 
share its Internet access with a notebook or tablet com-
puter. The exact steps depend on you phone’s operating 
system. On an iPhone, the feature is called Personal 
Hotspot. On a Windows Phone, it’s called Internet shar-
ing. On Android, it’s called Tethering & Portable Hotspot. 
Check out your phone now and see whether that feature 
is available. It’s not cost-effective as a long-term Internet 
access solution, but it works great when you don’t have 
other access available, such as in a car or boat.

Ways of Classifying Networks
As you learned in the previous section, the world is full of networks of 
various types. Most of the rest of this chapter, however, focuses specifi-
cally on networks that help personal and business computers connect 
with one another.
There are several ways to classify computer networks. You can look at 
them according to their geographical scope, the way the network is phys-
ically laid out, the way data travels through the network, and whether 
the network is wired (that is, connected with cables) or wireless. In the 
following sections you will look at networks in several of these ways.
Geographical Range
One way to classify networks is according to the geographical range that 
they cover, from a few feet within a single person’s office to a huge area 
that covers multiple countries or even multiple continents. Figure 13.6 
provides a graphical explanation of some of these ranges.
Figure 13.6  The geographical range of linked devices determines the type of network that 
connects them.
Personal Area Networks
A personal area network (PAN) consists of devices that directly con-
nect to a single computer. For example, if you are showing a presentation 
in a conference room during a business meeting, you might connect your 
notebook PC to the projector in the room. You might also form a PAN 
by connecting your smartphone to your computer.
Local Area Networks
A local area network (LAN) is a network in which all the devices are 
located within the same physical location, such as a single building or 
a group of adjacent buildings. A key characteristic of a LAN is that it is 
contained within a relatively small area. For example, your home network 
is a LAN, and so is the network at your school.
personal area network (PAN) A network 
formed when devices are connected to an indi-
vidual computer.
local area network (LAN) A network that 
connects devices housed in the same physical 
location.

445
Chapter 13: Networking and Internet Basics
Metropolitan Area Networks
A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a network that spans an entire 
town or city—or, as the name implies, a metropolitan area that might 
span a major city and its suburbs. A city might invest in a network infra-
structure, for example, and then businesses and individuals within that 
area might sign up to use the network.
Wide Area Networks 
A wide area network (WAN) is a geographically dispersed network, 
usually consisting of at least two LANs connected together by an exter-
nal link. A business or college with multiple separate campuses might link 
all the individual LANs together to form a WAN, for example. A WAN 
is not necessarily managed by a single organization and may include 
architecture and communications hardware from several different service 
providers. In this sense, the Internet is a form of global WAN.
Peer-to-Peer and Client/Server Networks
Another way to classify networks is to look at whether or not a server is 
involved in their management. As you learned in Chapter 1, a server is a 
computer that is dedicated to providing network and sharing services to 
the other computers on the network. Very small networks (10 comput-
ers or fewer) can get by without a server by operating as a peer-to-peer 
(P2P) network, also called a workgroup. In a P2P network, each com-
puter shares in the administrative burden of maintaining the network, as 
shown in Figure 13.7. Each computer is responsible for authenticating 
other users who want to share its resources (files and printers) and for 
making those resources available. A P2P network slows down each com-
puter slightly because of the overhead involved in the network. It is not 
usually noticeable with just a few computers, but the more computers 
there are, the greater the slowdown.
metropolitan area network (MAN) A 
network that connects devices within the area of 
a city or town.
wide area network (WAN) A network that 
spans at least two geographical locations; a busi-
ness with two or more offices may have a LAN at 
each site but use a WAN to connect them all to 
the same network.
peer-to-peer (P2P) network A network that 
consists only of clients (no servers).
Figure 13.7  Every computer shares administrative responsibilities on peer-to-peer 
networks, which have no servers.

446
Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
For larger networks, a client/server model is more effective. A client/
server network, such as the one shown in Figure 13.8, is a network that 
consists of one or more servers plus one or more clients—that is, com-
puters with which individuals run applications. Client/server networks 
can be any size, and can have multiple servers. Each server may perform 
a different type of network task, such as a file server or a print server. 
Each server may also serve a subset of the total pool of clients.
client/server network A network that con-
tains one or more servers.
client A computer used by an individual to run 
applications.
Figure 13.8  Client/server networks have one or more servers through which multiple 
computers can perform various tasks.
Intranets and Extranets
Some organizations have a part of the network that can only be accessed 
from within the organization. This sub-network is known as an intranet. 
The network administrator may enable intranet users to share message 
board items, link to external web pages, and comment on photos or 
news items that are posted. The intranet cannot be accessed by anyone 
outside the organization and can’t be accessed when staff are not physi-
cally located in the office unless they are given specific permission for 
remote access.
In contrast, a company may maintain an extranet, a separate network 
that is specifically intended for people outside the organization. An 
extranet may be used by the company’s business partners, contract 
employees, or customers to get real-time information, such as about 
products they supply that might soon need restocking.
Ethernet
Over the years since networking began, there have been several popular 
networking technologies—that is, different sets of standards for net-
working hardware and software. Each of these technologies has involved 
different hardware and software installed in each computer, different 
connection hardware, and different types of cables. Some of the early net-
working technologies included Token Ring, Banyan Vines, and Ethernet. 
All of those technologies have become obsolete except Ethernet. Most 
intranet A special network that only staff within 
the company network can access. For security 
reasons, an intranet can only be accessed onsite 
and not remotely.
extranet A special network set up by a business 
for its customers, staff, and business partners to 
access from outside the office network; may be 
used to share marketing assets and other non-
sensitive items.
Ethernet The current dominant standard for local 
area networking devices.

447
Chapter 13: Networking and Internet Basics
network hardware that you buy in stores today can be assumed to be 
Ethernet-compatible unless it specifies otherwise.
Ethernet can technically be either wired or wireless, but it is becoming 
increasingly common to refer to only the wired type as Ethernet; wireless 
Ethernet is popularly called Wi-Fi. (See the following section for more 
information about Wi-Fi.)
Ethernet devices have a certain maximum speed. For example, 1000BaseT 
Ethernet, which is common in most residential and business networks, 
transfers data at up to 1000 Mbps (1 Gbps). The “T” in the name refers 
to the twisted-pair cables used; you will learn more about cables in the 
“Network Hardware” section later in this chapter. The Ethernet standard 
also allows fiber optic cable and very high rates of data transfer (such as 
10-Gigabit Ethernet, which transfers data at up to 10 Gbps).
Wireless Networking Technologies
A network can connect devices using either wired or wireless connec-
tions. A wired connection runs a cable between the points, whereas wire-
less connects the two points via radio frequency (RF) or infrared.
Wireless communications have two main uses. The first use is at the 
endpoints of network connectivity, where a device such as a smartphone 
or laptop computer connects wirelessly to a router or other device that 
provides network and/or Internet access. The second use is as a source 
of transferring data between locations when using cables is not practical, 
such as with satellite and microwave systems.
1000BaseT A type of Ethernet that transfers 
data at up to 1000 Mbps over twisted-pair cables.
NOTE
A single network can contain a mixture of wired and wireless connections, as long as they are the same 
network technology. For example, if you have a router in your home through which all the computers share an 
Internet connection, some of the computers can connect to it with wired Ethernet and others can connect to 
it via Wi-Fi. Because they all share a common network technology (Ethernet), they work together seamlessly. 
However, networks using different technologies cannot communicate with one another. For example, you can’t 
use a Bluetooth device to connect to an Ethernet network.
Wi-Fi
Wi-Fi is short for wireless fidelity. It’s the common name for the wire-
less networking technology that’s used for almost all home and business 
networks today, often referred to by its standard number: IEEE 802.11. 
Whenever you use wireless networking to access the Internet at your 
home or workplace or in a public location such as a cafe or library, you 
are using Wi-Fi.
Wi-Fi Wireless Ethernet. A means of connecting 
computers and other devices wirelessly. Another 
name for it is IEEE 802.11, its technical standard.
NOTE
IEEE is the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. It publishes the standards for many different 
technologies. IEEE 802.11 is the standard that governs Wi-Fi, but there are also many other standards too. 
For example, 1394 is the standard for FireWire, and 802.15 is the standard for Bluetooth (although nobody 
calls Bluetooth by its standard number).

448
Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
There have been different versions of the Wi-Fi standard since its original 
development. The popular version today is 802.11n, which can carry up to 
600 Mbps of data over a range of up to 230 feet indoors or 840 feet out-
doors. An update to it called 802.11ac has recently been approved; it may 
already be incorporated into networking devices you can buy in stores by 
the time you read this. 802.11ac has a maximum throughput of 1.3 Gbps, 
more than doubling the capacity of 802.11n. Table 13.1 lists the different 
Wi-Fi standards and their speeds and distances.

Bluetooth
Bluetooth is a wireless technology used to connect individual devices to 
one another in close proximity. It is most commonly used to connect a 
computer to an input or output device. For example, you might have a 
Bluetooth headphone that you use with your smartphone, or you might 
have a Bluetooth-enabled printer that you can use with your notebook PC. 
A personal area network (PAN) forms when the devices are within range 
of each other and they are paired (by using software to authenticate them 
to one another). When the devices are no longer in range of one another, 
the PAN stops. Bluetooth is limited to about 20 feet in range, so it isn’t a 
practical technology to use for wireless networking in general (such as to 
share an Internet connection with computers all over a home or office).
Bluetooth An inexpensive short-range network-
ing technology used for computer-to-device 
connections such as computer-to-printer or 
phone-to-headset.
pair To connect a Bluetooth input or output device 
to a computer.
Put It to Work
Pairing Bluetooth Devices
To connect devices via Bluetooth, 
you must pair them. Pairing can 
take several different forms, 
depending on the devices. For 
example, one device might gener-
ate a PIN code and the other one 
might prompt you to type that PIN 
code to confirm. Obviously, that 
works only if both devices have 
a display screen on which a PIN 
code could display, of course. For 
a device without a display, such 
as a Bluetooth mouse, the device 
will have a button you can press 
to make it temporarily discover-
able. Press the button (you may 
have to hold it for a few seconds), 
following the directions in the 
device’s documentation to make it discoverable, and then select it on the screen of the device with which you want 
to pair it. In Windows, you can access the Bluetooth controls via the Control Panel.

449
Chapter 13: Networking and Internet Basics
Infrared
Infrared technology uses light waves to “beam” information from device 
to device. Infrared was the method of choice for connecting wireless 
peripherals a decade or so ago, but Bluetooth has mainly superseded it 
today. However, infrared is still used for most remote controls for TVs 
and other home theater components. The main drawback of infrared 
transmission is that it must have a clear line of sight between the two 
points. The standard for an infrared connection is IrDA (short for 
Infrared Data Association, the organization that created and manages the 
standard).
Microwave
Microwaves are high-frequency radio waves. A microwave communica-
tion system allows two locations to be wirelessly connected by using 
a high-frequency communication band, much higher than that used 
for Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. The points can be miles apart (up to about 
25 miles), but as long as there are no visible obstructions between them, 
they can exchange data. Because line of sight is so critical for microwave 
communications, the transmitters are often placed high up on towers 
or buildings. Microwave technology is not as widely used today as it 
was prior to the development of satellite networking systems, but it still 
has some special uses; for example, military forces use it to quickly set 
up communications in areas where the terrain is too rugged to support 
wired connections and security is critical. (A point-to-point micro-
wave connection is more secure than a connection that goes through a 
satellite.)
infrared Older type of wireless communication 
that used light waves to pass simple information 
between nearby devices.
microwave communication system A secure, 
point-to-point wireless networking technology that 
requires a line of sight between the two points.

Network Hardware
Network connectivity requires both hardware and software. The software 
portion is handled by the operating system; all modern operating systems 
include network support. However, not all computers include network-
ing hardware, and some network hardware is independent of any one 
computer, so you may at some point find yourself shopping for network-
ing hardware. In the following sections, you will learn about several 
common network hardware devices.

450
Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
Network Adapters
Each network client device (computer, tablet, printer, and so on) must 
have a network adapter. A network adapter enables the computer 
to participate in the local area network. Most desktop and notebook 
computers come with a wired Ethernet adapter built in, and notebook 
computers almost always include a built-in wireless adapter as well.
When a network adapter is not built into the motherboard, but instead 
installed as an expansion board, it is called a network interface card 
(NIC). Although it is not technically accurate, the term NIC (pro-
nounced “nick”) has come to refer to any network adapter, not just 
an add-on card. Most portable computers (notebooks, tablets, smart-
phones) have a Wi-Fi network adapter built in. A portable device may 
also have other built-in network adapters, such as a Bluetooth adapter.
You can configure a device’s network adapter via the Settings or Control 
Panel in the operating system. You can turn the various wireless adapters 
on or off on a tablet or smartphone, for instance. Many people choose 
to keep Bluetooth and Wi-Fi turned off to save battery life when those 
adapters are not being used.
network adapter A hardware component that 
enables a computer to connect to a network.
network interface card (NIC) A network 
adapter that is on an expansion card, rather than 
built into the computer’s motherboard. Sometimes 
used informally to refer to any network adapter.
Careers in IT
Network Installer
Technicians who install networks have an active work environment. 
Rather than sitting at a desk all day, as most IT professionals do, 
installers are out crawling around in the ceilings and basements of 
buildings, running cables and mounting satellite dishes. They set 
up closets with stacks of switches and routers in them, configure 
network security settings, and make sure all network hardware is 
installed correctly and functioning well. To install networks, you should 
have at least a high school diploma, plus a technical certification such 
as CompTIA Network+. To learn more about Network+ certification,

Step by Step
Checking Device Manager for Network Devices
Not sure what network adapters are installed on your PC? Follow these steps to find out:
	 1.	In Windows, click Start and click Control Panel.
	 2.	Click Hardware and Sound.
	 3.	Click Device Manager. The Device Manager window 
opens.
	 4.	Click the arrow to the left of Network Adapters to 
expand that category. The available network adapt-
ers appear. For example, in the example screen-
shot, there are four network adapters. You can 
deduce from their names what kind of networks 
they support.
	 5.	Double-click the network adapter with Ethernet in 
its name. Its Properties box appears.
	 6.	Click each of the tabs in the dialog box to review 
its settings, and then click Cancel.
	 7.	Close the Device Manager window, and close the 
Control Panel window.
Each network adapter has a hardware address, called a media access 
control (MAC) address, that is unique in all the world. This address, 
also called a physical address, is hard-coded into a chip on the adapter 
and never changes, regardless of the network being used. Low-level net-
working software uses the MAC address to ensure it is delivering data to 
the right device. The MAC address is separate from the network-specific 
address, such as the IP address (covered in Chapter 15, “Web Basics”).
media access control (MAC) address A 
unique hardware address for a network adapter.

Switches and Hubs
A switch is a box that provides a central gathering point for all the 
computers in an Ethernet LAN. Each computer’s network adapter 
connects to the switch, either via a cable or wirelessly. (Bluetooth and 
infrared wireless networks don’t use switches because they only connect 
individual devices to one another, not groups of devices.) The switch 
manages the data traffic between the devices. If one device wants to send 
something to another device on the same network, it sends its request to 
the switch, and the switch delivers the message to the proper destination. 
Figure 13.9 shows a switch for a wired network, with eight ports into 
which you can connect cables from network adapters. A wireless switch is 
called a wireless access point (WAP).

Chapter 13: Networking and Internet Basics
A switch is able to read the addressing information on a packet and 
intelligently route it to the right port so it will reach its destination. An 
earlier version of a switch, called a hub, was not so intelligent. Rather 
than sending the message only to the correct port, it would send all traf-
fic to all ports and rely on each computer to ignore anything that wasn’t 
addressed to it. Using a hub placed a performance drain on each com-
puter because it had to spend so much time checking network packets; 
switches are much better for network performance and are much more 
commonly used today.
Routers
A router performs all the same functions as a switch, but it also has an 
added bonus: It can direct traffic into and out of the LAN. For example, 
suppose you have two separate groups of computers, each group con-
nected to its own switch, and you want their computers to be able to 
communicate with one another. If you use a router instead of a switch 
for each group, the routers will be able to transfer data packets that 
belong to the other group. Each router has an output port called a 
default gateway that enables data to leave the local network to be 
delivered. On some routers, the port may be labeled Uplink, WAN, or 
Internet.
Routers serve an important role in home 
networks because they enable multiple 
computers to share a single Internet 
connection. The broadband modem 
connects to the router’s output port, and 
the router directs all Internet requests 
from each of the computers to that port. 
When data comes in from the Internet, 
the router directs it to the computer that 
requested it. The type of router used 
for this purpose is sometimes called a 
broadband router. A broadband router 
can be wired or wireless; Figure 13.10 
shows a small wireless router suitable for 
home use. Like most wireless routers, it 
has several ports for plugging in Ethernet 
cables, so it can serve for both your wired 
and wireless devices. You can tell it’s a 
wireless router because it has an antenna.
Routers also make the Internet possible. The Internet consists of a mesh 
of interconnected commercial-grade routers that pass data back and forth 
between them. To deliver a packet from one point to another on the 
Internet, the packet is routed through a series of hops, from one router 
to another, until it reaches its destination.
Gateways, Bridges, and Repeaters
The term gateway has two meanings. At the software level, as you 
learned in the previous section, the default gateway is an output port 
on a router. At the hardware level, a gateway is a connector box that 
enables you to connect two dissimilar networks by translating the data 
hub A primitive version of a switch that lacks the 
capability to read packet addresses and route 
them to the appropriate port.
router A connection box for Ethernet networks 
that physically joins the devices in the network 
(wired) or provides wireless connectivity (wireless), 
and enables a connection to an outside network 
such as the Internet.
default gateway The port on a router that con-
nects to external networks.

Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
requests between them and providing the correct physical connectors for 
each network type. For example, a gateway might join an Ethernet-based 
LAN to a mainframe computer. A bridge is a device that connects two 
similar networks, such as Ethernet networks in two different buildings.
A repeater does just what the name implies—it repeats a network sig-
nal. As network traffic travels a long distance, the signal weakens and 
errors may be introduced. A repeater reads the incoming data and then 
rebroadcasts it.
Network Cables
Wired communication media consists mainly of various types of cables. 
Data can be carried efficiently and reliably through cables, and some 
cables can carry data at very high speeds. Here are the most common 
types of network cables you may encounter.
Twisted-Pair Cable
Most of the Ethernet cables in business and residential buildings are 
twisted-pair cable. It gets its name from the pairs of copper wires inside 
the cable. The wires twisting around each other help reduce electromag-
netic interference (EMI) caused by the magnetic field generated when 
electricity passes through the cable.
Most twisted-pair cable is unshielded-twisted pair (UTP). Shielding is 
an optional copper mesh in the lining of a cable that cuts down on EMI 
getting through to the cable from external sources. Shielded-twisted 
pair (STP) contains this extra lining and is used in environments where 
EMI is a problem, such as in cables run through ceilings with fluorescent 
light fixtures in them.
There are different types of 
UTP cable, which have differ-
ent numbers of wire pairs and 
can carry data reliably at dif-
ferent maximum speeds. When 
you connect a telephone to a 
phone jack in a home or busi-
ness wall outlet, for example, 
you use Category 3 (Cat3) 
cable, which contains either 
one or two pairs of wires (for 
a one-line or two-line phone 
system). The connector for a 
telephone cable is either an 
RJ-11 (two wires) or RJ-14 
(four wires). The cable used 
in Ethernet networking (the 
most common type of net-
working, used in most homes 
and businesses) is an 8-wire type called Category 5e (Cat5e) that can 
carry data reliably at up to 1000 Mbps (which, you may remember from 
the Ethernet section earlier in this chapter, is the same maximum speed 
as 1000BaseT Ethernet). It has a wider connector than that of a phone 
cable, called an RJ-45 connector, shown in Figure 13.11.

nect two networks of similar types.
repeater A device that receives and retransmits 
a network signal.
twisted-pair cable Cable that transfers data 
via pairs of copper wires that are twisted around 
each other to reduce electromagnetic interference.
electromagnetic interference (EMI) The 
corruption of data as it is passing through a cable 
due to the magnetic field generated by a nearby 
cable.

twisted-pair cable that does not have an outer 
sheath that protects against external EMI.

twisted-pair cable that has an outer sheath that 
protects against external EMI.

telephone systems.

cables.

Chapter 13: Networking and Internet Basics
Coaxial Cable
Coaxial cable is the 
type of cable used 
for cable TV con-
nections; if you have 
cable Internet, it’s 
the cable that runs 
from the wall to your 
cable modem. Like 
twisted-pair cable, it 
carries data in electri-
cal signals. It’s a 
more expensive cable 
than twisted pair, but 
it can carry much 
more data and at faster speeds. Coaxial cable consists of a single copper 
wire in the center, surrounded by insulation, with a plastic jacket on the 
outside. See Figure 13.12. Coaxial cable is not normally used for net-
working within a building anymore, although some older, now-obsolete 
forms of networking used it.
Fiber Optic Cable
Whereas the cables 
you’ve learned about 
so far carry data 
electrically, fiber 
optic cable car-
ries data in pulses 
of light along a 
glass fiber (see 
Figure 13.13). Each 
fiber is very tiny—
about the thickness 
of a human hair. 
Each cable con-
tains hundreds of 
fibers, and can carry 
billions of bits per 
second. Fiber optic 
cable is often used as the backbone (the central part) of a network, such 
as to move large amounts of data between points on the Internet. It’s 
reliable, fast, and not subject to EMI; it’s also very hard to snoop or hack 
into, making the connection very secure. Fiber optic cable isn’t widely 
used at the consumer level, though, because it is expensive and difficult 
to install and maintain. It’s also not compatible with most consumer-
level networking equipment.

copper core with an insulated sleeve around it.

Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
Understanding and Connecting  
to the Internet
The Internet began as a way of enabling research institutions and the 
military to share information. Today, however, it is the largest and 
most-used network in the world, and it is used not only by schools and 
governments but by businesses, non-profit organizations, and individu-
als in every country and of every profession. You can use the Internet 
to look up information on the web, send and receive email, exchange 
instant messages, upload and download files, and much more. You 
will learn more about the uses of the Internet in Chapter 14, “Online 
Communication,” and Chapter 15, “Web Basics.”
Internet Structure
Structurally, the Internet is a mesh of routers and servers connected to 
one another at multiple points, as illustrated in Figure 13.14. This makes 
the Internet very fault-tolerant. If any single router or server goes down, 
network traffic is simply routed around the point of failure.
© iStockphoto.com/iSergey
Figure 13.14  A mesh network does not rely on any one point being active; 
traffic can easily route around any blockages.
At the beginning of this chapter you learned about packet-switched 
networks. The Internet is a packet-switched network, which means each 
message sent is broken up into multiple data packets and each packet is 
sent individually across the network. When the packets arrive at the des-
tination computer, they are opened and the data is reassembled into the 
original message. In this description, the term message is generic, and can 
refer to any data sent or received, such as the request to display a web 
page, the information you enter in an online form, or an email you send.

457
Chapter 13: Networking and Internet Basics
Internet Speed
The Internet itself does not have a fixed speed. Data travels through 
the Internet as fast as it can go on whatever cable it travels through, 
and a single data packet may travel at different speeds during differ-
ent parts of its journey. At the heart of the Internet are high-capacity, 
high-speed data pathways that are like superhighways for data. These 
pathways form the Internet’s backbone. The backbone is made up 
mainly of fiber optic cables that can carry data very fast—literally at 
the speed of light! Large ISPs have entire buildings full of servers 
that are connected directly to the Internet off of this main backbone. 
From the ISP’s servers to the individual neighborhoods and individual 
homes and businesses, the connection speeds are lower because the 
cheaper copper-based cables used in those areas carry data at a lower 
rate. Some ISPs charge different prices for different speeds of Internet 
connection, and they throttle the connection speed (usually at the 
broadband modem) for customers who have signed up for a slower 
connection.
The Internet service that you subscribe to has two speeds, both mea-
sured in megabytes per second (Mbps). The first is its theoretical 
maximum speed, which is what your ISP tells you that it is delivering 
under optimal conditions. The second is your actual speed, which will 
be lower.
Some of the factors that affect actual performance speed include:
◾	 Internet traffic: During peak hours of the day, when more people 
are using the Internet, overall speeds may be slower.
◾	 Local traffic: If you have cable Internet, you share bandwidth with 
your neighbors. If someone is using a lot of bandwidth, such as 
streaming multiple movies at once into his or her home, your con-
nection’s performance may suffer.
◾	 Server issues: Individual websites that you try to view may be 
located on a server that has a slow connection to the Internet or is 
located in an area where Internet traffic is currently heavy, or the 
server may be experiencing problems such as overloading (when 
too many people try to access the same server at once).
◾	 Throttling: If you have used more data than your Internet service 
provider allows you to use for a certain time period, the ISP may 
temporarily throttle the speed of your connection for a certain 
amount of time (usually 24 hours) as a penalty. This is common 
on satellite Internet service, but uncommon on other service 
types.

a network, where connection speeds are high and 
the data pathway is wide.

offers free testing. You can search for a free testing site, or try one of these:

Types of Internet Connections
When choosing Internet service for your home or business, there are a 
variety of factors to consider. Speed is important, of course—faster is bet-
ter. However, faster may also be more expensive. It’s also important to 
look at availability, and evaluate any package deals you may be able to get 
with other services such as cable TV or phone service.
In the following sections, you’ll learn about the major types of Internet 
connections available to consumers today. All of these types except dial-
up are always-on broadband connections. The word broadband literally 
means wide path, but when referring to Internet connectivity it refers to 
a connection with a speed higher than 256 Kbps. Many of today’s broad-
band Internet options are much faster than that.
Dial-Up Internet 
In the early days of the Internet, dial-up access was all that was available. A 
dial-up connection uses a telephone line to connect to an ISP at a maximum 
speed of around 44.8 Kbps. Dial-up connections have many drawbacks. You 
cannot use the phone line for telephone calls while you are connected to the 
Internet, and the Internet connection is not always on; you must connect 
to the Internet when you want to use it, and then disconnect when you are 
finished. The speed is very slow (less than 1/100th of a more modern con-
nection, on the average), resulting in frustrating waits for every operation.
A dial-up connection is established using a dial-up modem. The word 
modem is short for modulator/demodulator. A modem converts the 
broadband A fast, always-on network connection.
dial-up modem A device that converts between 
analog and digital data so computer data can be 
sent over analog phone lines.

459
Chapter 13: Networking and Internet Basics
digital data from the computer to an analog (sound) signal for delivery 
over the phone line. Then at the receiving end, another modem converts 
the analog signal back to digital for the computer’s use at that end. The 
modems go on converting between analog and digital for one another as 
long as the connection is active.
A dial-up modem can either be internal (built into the computer) or 
external (a separate device you connect to one of the computer’s ports). 
Most dial-up modems have two phone jacks. You connect your phone 
cable from the wall to one of them, and you can optionally connect your 
phone to the other one so that when the modem is not in use, you can 
continue to use your phone normally.
To use a dial-up modem, you issue a command in the operating system 
or in a communication software application that tells the modem what 
number to dial. You get the phone number from your ISP. The modem 
makes some noises as it is connecting, but then the noises stop when the 
connection is made.
Cable Internet
At the other end of the speed spectrum from dial-up is cable Internet 
access. Cable is currently the fastest type of commercially available Internet 
access for residential customers, theoretically delivering top speeds of up to 
30 Mbps (although most connections top out at around 20 Mbps).
Cable Internet is delivered 
through the same coaxial cable 
as the cable TV program-
ming. You connect a splitter 
to the cable coming in from 
the wall, to allow the cable to 
go to both your TV and to a 
cable modem (which may be 
provided by the cable com-
pany for a monthly lease fee). 
Figure 13.15 shows one model 
of cable modem; there are 
many different models. You 
can connect one computer 
directly to the cable modem 
via an Ethernet cable to 
receive high-speed Internet on 
that computer.
You can also optionally share 
the Internet connection with 
other computers in your home 
or office by using a broad-
band router. You connect an 
Ethernet cable from the cable 
modem to the broadband 
router’s Uplink port, and the 
router sees the Internet con-
nection as an external network 
and allows all the computers

connected to the router to participate in it. Some cable modems are 
dual-purpose units, with a router built in. If you have one of these, you 
do not need a separate router. Sharing an Internet connection with a 
router works the same way with most other broadband Internet connec-
tion types too, including DSL and satellite (covered next).
DSL Internet
Digital subscriber line (DSL) is a high-speed Internet connection from 
your local land-based telephone company. There are two types of DSL: 
asynchronous DSL (ADSL), in which the download speeds are higher 
than the upload speeds, and synchronous DSL (SDSL), in which the 
upload and download speeds are the same. Ordinary DSL uses the same 
twisted-pair cable to provide Internet that it does to provide voice service, 
with a splitter used to separate the data and voice signals so you can use 
them both at once. This type of DSL has a speed ranging from 256 Kbps 
to 20 Mbps depending on the distance between the service address and 
the phone company’s connection box. It can also deliver high-definition 
TV and phone service, all on a single line. The main drawback to DSL is 
that it is geographically limited. For top speeds, the service address must 
be within 1,000 meters of a phone company service box.
Some newer types of DSL, such as AT&T’s U-Verse system, use a new 
technology called Very High Bit Rate DSL (VDSL). It can deliver up 
to 52 Mbps download and 16 Mbps upload on copper wires and up to 
85 Mbps (both download and upload) on coaxial cable.
Satellite Internet
Satellite Internet service uses the same communication satellites that 
you learned about earlier in this chapter. Satellite Internet service 
involves using a satellite dish for receiving and a satellite transmitter 
for sending data. Because the transmitter positioning is important and 
improper positioning may violate communication laws, professional 
installation is usually required.
Satellite service is not likely to be anyone’s first choice as a broadband 
Internet connection. It is relatively slow (around 1 Mbps) and suffers from 
significant latency (delay) issues that make it unsuitable for performance-
sensitive online activities like video conferencing and playing action-based 
games. Satellite Internet providers also typically place usage caps on user 
accounts, and penalize subscribers either by charging more or temporarily 
throttling connection speed for using too much data. However, satellite 
is available just about anywhere, even in the most rural of areas, as long 
as there is a clear view of the southern sky (in the northern hemisphere). 
When faced with the choice of dial-up modem connection or satellite, 
people who need a broadband connection will go with satellite.
Internet over Cell Phone Networks
Modern cell phone network providers such as Verizon and AT&T not 
only offer telephone service, but also Internet service. This service is 
mainly offered to be used to access the Internet via smartphones, but 
it can also be used to connect other devices as well, such as tablets,

notebooks, and even desktops to get Internet access in situations where 
Wi-Fi and other Internet connection methods are not available, such as 
when riding in an automobile.
Not all areas of cell phone networks worldwide have the appropriate 
technology and speed to access the Internet. There have been many 
different cell phone standards and technologies over the years, and it 
has only been recently, with the development of 3G, that cell phone 
networks have become fast enough to support Internet use. 3G, which 
stands for 3rd Generation, supports download speeds of up to 14 Mbps. 
An even newer and faster technology, 4G, can support up to 100 Mbps 
downloads. Cell phone companies provide coverage maps that show the 
areas in which they provide 3G or 4G service.
3G Digital technology for moving data through a 
cell phone network at up to 14 Mbps.
4G Digital technology for moving data through a

CAUTION
If your cell phone data plan is not unlimited, be aware of how much you are using the Internet via your cell 
phone, to avoid extra charges for going over your data limit. Your cell phone provider may have a website or a 
phone utility that enables you to see how much data you have used on the current billing cycle.

Summary
Our Connected World: Communication Systems
Networking is everywhere, and many of our everyday activities are enabled or assisted by com-
puter networking. For example, the public-switched telephone network (PSTN) is a worldwide 
network that predates the Internet. It is an example of a circuit-switched network, one that cre-
ates a connection between two points and maintains it for the duration of the communication. In 
contrast, a packet-switched network is one that sends and receives data in packets that may take 
different routes to the destination.
The Internet is the world’s largest network. It uses various standard protocols, so that services 
like the web and email work the same everywhere. Most companies don’t connect directly to the 
Internet; instead they connect to an Internet service provider (ISP).
The Internet is based on a protocol stack (a set of protocols) called Transmission Control 
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). TCP/IP provides a common set of standards by which 
data can be sent and received. It is used not only on the Internet, but in most private networks 
today as well.
To tighten security when using the Internet as a conduit, many companies use a software technol-
ogy called virtual private networking (VPN). VPN technology creates a secure, tamper-resistant 
data tunnel between two points on the Internet.
A satellite is a transmitter/receiver unit that orbits the Earth, thousands of miles up. Satellite 
networks are used to deliver services such as TV and video broadcasts, satellite radio, and satellite 
Internet service. Cellular telephone companies have their own data networks, using a combination 
of satellites, cables, and on-ground towers with transmitters and receivers on them. Some cell phone 
networks can also be used to access the Internet. You can access the Internet on a smartphone (a 
cell phone that includes computer functionality), and you can tether (connect) a smartphone to a 
computer and use the phone as a modem to allow the computer Internet access.
Ways of Classifying Networks
There are several ways to classify computer networks. One way is according to the geographical 
range that they cover: personal area network (PAN), local area network (LAN), metropolitan 
area network (MAN), or wide area network (WAN). Another way is to look at whether or not 
a server is involved. In a peer-to-peer network, there is no server; in a client/server network 
there is at least one server.
An intranet is a network accessible only from inside a company. An extranet is a network that is 
for the use of those outside the organization.
Ethernet is the most popular Internet technology, having outlived many competitors such as 
Token Ring and Banyan Vines. Ethernet can be wired or wireless; the wireless version is also called 
Wi-Fi. Ethernet devices have a certain maximum speed. For example, 1000BaseT Ethernet, which 
is common in most residential and business networks, transfers data at up to 1000 Mbps (1 Gbps).
A wired connection runs a cable between the points, whereas wireless connects the two points via 
radio frequency (RF) or infrared. Wi-Fi is short for wireless fidelity. It’s the common name for 
the wireless networking technology that’s used for almost all home and business networks today, 
often referred to by its standard number: IEEE 802.11. Bluetooth is a wireless technology used 

465
Chapter 13: Networking and Internet Basics
to connect individual devices to one another in close proximity. It is most commonly used to con-
nect a computer to an input or output device. When the devices are within range, they are paired. 
Infrared technology uses light waves to “beam” information from device to device. Infrared was 
the method of choice for connecting wireless peripherals a decade or so ago, but Bluetooth has 
mainly superseded it today. A microwave communication system allows two locations to be wire-
lessly connected by using a high-frequency communication band, much higher than that used for 
Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
Network Hardware
A network adapter enables a computer to participate in the local area network. When a network 
adapter is not built into the motherboard, but instead installed as an expansion board, it is called a 
network interface card (NIC). Each network adapter has a hardware address, called a media 
access control (MAC) address, that is unique in all the world.
A switch is a box that provides a central gathering point for all the computers in an Ethernet 
LAN. A wireless switch is called a wireless access point (WAP). An earlier version of a switch, 
called a hub, was not so intelligent. A router performs all the same functions as a switch, but it 
also has an added bonus: It can direct traffic into and out of the LAN. Each router has an output 
port called a default gateway that enables data to leave the local network to be delivered.
A gateway enables you to connect two dissimilar networks. A bridge connects two similar net-
works. A repeater does just what the name implies—it repeats a network signal to strengthen it on 
its way to its destination.
Most of the Ethernet cables in business and residential buildings are twisted-pair cable. The 
wires twisting around each other helps reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI) caused by 
the magnetic field generated when electricity passes through the cable. Most twisted-pair cable 
is unshielded twisted pair (UTP). Shielded twisted pair (STP) contains this extra lining, and 
is used in environments where EMI is a problem. Cat3 cable is used for telephone networks and 
has an RJ-11 or RJ-14 connector. Cat5e cable is used for modern Ethernet networks and uses an 
RJ-45 connecter. Coaxial cable is the type of cable used for cable TV connections. It is also used 
for some networking, such as delivering cable Internet to a home. Fiber optic cable carries data in 
pulses of light along a glass fiber.
Understanding and Connecting to the Internet
The Internet began as a way of enabling research institutions and the military to share information. 
Structurally, the Internet is a mesh of routers and servers connected to one another at ­multiple 
points.
At the heart of the Internet are high-capacity, high-speed data pathways that are like superhigh-
ways for data. These pathways form the Internet’s backbone.
The Internet service that you subscribe to has two speeds, both measured in megabytes per second 
(Mbps). Many factors can prevent an Internet connection from achieving its top speed, including 
local and Internet traffic and problems with your own broadband modem or router.
Types of Internet connections include dial-up and broadband. A dial-up connection is established 
using a dial-up modem. It is a very slow and inconvenient connection. Broadband connections 
are usually always on. Types of broadband connections include cable modem, digital subscriber 
line (DSL), satellite Internet, and cell phone networks with 3G and 4G service.

Troubleshooting Network and Internet Connections
The Windows Network Diagnostics troubleshooter can find and fix most network-related prob-
lems. To start troubleshooting a network issue, look at the network icon in the notification area; 
its icon’s appearance may give you a clue as to what is wrong. For Internet connection problems, 
restarting the router, broadband modem, and/or computer can often fix the problem.

Finding a Fast Internet Connection
Suppose a neighbor wanted to know what the best Internet connection available in your neighbor-
hood is. Use the Internet to research this topic, and find the fastest service available at your home 
address. Collect all the information you can about this service, including:
◾	 What company is providing it?
◾	 What is the advertised speed of the connection?
◾	 What connection technology does it use?
◾	 How much does it cost per month?
◾	 Are there any startup costs involved?
Think It Over
Virtual Private Networking
With a VPN, a company can use the Internet to establish a secure communication channel 
between two points without going to the expense of leasing a data line. There are some people 
who say that it’s unfair, though, that large companies can use so much bandwidth, making the 
whole Internet run slower for everyone else, without paying for it. Do you agree? Do you think 
companies that transfer a large amount of data on an everyday basis should pay more, or should be 
forced to lease their own lines?
Metropolitan Area Networks
Suppose you are the mayor of a small town, and it has been suggested that the town install a 
metropolitan area network that will provide low-cost, high-speed Wi-Fi to all citizens who want 
it. Proponents say that it will encourage people to move to the town and will encourage highly 
educated young adults to stay in town instead of moving away. Opponents argue that the town 
will go into debt paying for such a system with no guarantee that enough people will sign up for 
the service to make it pay for itself. What questions would you want answered in order to help you 
make up your mind?

Learning objectives
◽	 Understand the channels available for Internet communications
◽	 Recognize the features of the different communication types
◽	 Choose the correct communication medium for a particular situation
◽	 Understand appropriate etiquette for online communication
◽	 Understand the basic features of email programs and how to use them
The way we communicate with friends and business associates has changed dra-
matically in the last decade, thanks to the Internet. Our communication channels 
are increasingly shifting toward computer-assisted technologies, many of which are 
not only more immediate but also less expensive to use than the non-computerized 
alternatives. For example, a business can save a great deal of money by sending its 
advertisements to customers by email rather than postal mail and by meeting with 
clients through videoconferencing rather than having employees travel to the client 
site, and families can keep in touch using video chat services, as in Figure 14.1.
With all these new technologies for communication available, though, it can be 
a challenge to select the appropriate communication medium for a situation. In 
addition, each new form of communication comes with its own social conventions 
about the type of language to use, the format messages should take, and the appro-
priate level of formality. Whether or not you conform to these communication 
rules directly affects how well your message is received.
In this chapter, we will review the many different types of computer-assisted com-
munication technologies available in today’s world. You’ll learn about their pros 
and cons and accepted uses, and you’ll learn some of the etiquette rules and cus-
toms that will enable you to get your message across effectively.

Figure 14.1  The Internet has changed the way people communicate by offering 
technologies such as video chatting, email, and instant messaging.
Internet Communication Types
The Internet in its original form was for the transfer of data between 
computers over a network. Email was one of the first Internet applica-
tions and is one of the most popular means of communication. Many 
more ways of communicating online are now available, including:
◾	 Instant messaging
◾	 Social networking
◾	 Blogs and microblogs
◾	 Newsgroups
◾	 Forums
◾	 Voice over IP (VoIP)
◾	 Video chat/videoconferencing
Many of these communication options require little more than a web 
connection and a username and password for the particular service. This 
chapter explains how some of these systems work and helps you choose 
appropriate communications tools.
Email
Email (short for electronic mail) is the computer equivalent of postal 
mail. Billions of email messages are exchanged every day through a 
worldwide system of email servers.
Email is a store-and-forward system, as shown in Figure 14.2, not 
an instant communication medium. When you compose and send an 
email, your provider’s outgoing mail server forwards it to the recipient’s 
incoming mail server. The message is stored there until the recipient logs 
in and picks it up. Each ISP or organization that provides email service 
has its own mail servers that participate in this global network for mail

messages through mail servers.
store-and-forward A message delivery system 
in which messages are forwarded between servers 
and then stored on those servers until they are 
picked up.
mail server An online server that sends and/or 
receives email messages on behalf of the email 
addresses it supports.

Chapter 14: Online Communication
delivery. To access your messages on your incoming mail server, you can 
use a mail client (email software installed on your computer) or you can 
log into a web-based interface maintained by your email provider.
Figure 14.2  Email is a store-and-forward system involving mail servers on the Internet. Mail is forwarded from one mail server to another, 
and then is stored until the recipient picks it up.
Most providers that offer free email services, like Google, Yahoo!, and 
AOL, are primarily web-based. These types of email accounts are some-
times referred to as HTTP email accounts. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer 
Protocol) is a protocol for web content transmission. You might be able 
to set up certain mail clients to work with those accounts, but it is gener-
ally expected that you will use the web interface.
On the other hand, a mail client is customarily used for most email 
accounts that someone pays for, either directly or indirectly. For example, 
the email accounts at your workplace, the accounts that your ISP pro-
vides to you, and the accounts that you have through a web-hosting 
service (for example, if you own a domain name) are all designed to be 
used with a mail client.
Two kinds of email accounts are designed to be used with mail clients: a 
POP account and an IMAP account. Each uses a different protocol for 
receiving mail, and offers slightly different advantages.
◾	 Post Office Protocol (POP) is a literal store-and-forward proto-
col. It holds the messages until you pick them up, but it doesn’t 
maintain any direct communication with your email client. You can 
choose to leave the messages on the server or delete them from 
the server after you pick them up, but what you do with them after 
that point is of no concern to the server. For example, you could 
delete an email from your email client, and the message would con-
tinue to persist on the server. POP accounts work well for people 
who always work with their email from the same computer.
mail client Software installed on a computer 
that is used to compose and manage email.
HTTP email account An email account that 
is designed to be used with a web interface, and 
that uses web technology for email management.
POP account An email account that is designed 
to be used with an email client and that uses POP 
protocol for receiving mail.
IMAP account An email account that is 
designed to be used with an email client and that 
uses IMAP protocol for receiving mail.
Post Office Protocol (POP) A protocol for 
receiving email through a mail client.

474
Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
◾	 Internet Mail Access Protocol (IMAP) is a modified version of 
store-and-forward. It continues to hold your messages even after 
you pick them up, and anything you do in your email client is 
reflected on the server. For example, if you delete a message, or 
create a new folder for storing messages, that change is automati-
cally reflected in the email clients of every device that you use. The 
drawbacks are that you may not be able to access old mail without 
an Internet connection and not every email provider offers IMAP 
accounts.
The POP and IMAP protocol are used only for receiving email; a com-
plementary protocol called Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is 
used for sending email from a POP or IMAP account.
The line between HTTP, POP, and IMAP accounts has become blurry in 
recent years, as more email providers have attempted to give customers 
more options without making them change email account types. Most 
providers allow customers the option of a web-based interface no matter 
what type of email account they have, and some email clients can send 
and receive mail from HTTP accounts, either natively or with some spe-
cial setup. In addition, some free web-based email services offer custom-
ers the option of paying a small amount for an upgrade to an account 
that can be used as a POP or IMAP account.
Instant Messaging, Texting, and Chatting
Instant messaging (IM) is another type of written message that is sent 
over the Internet. As its name suggests, the message is sent immediately 
rather than waiting for the recipient to log on to the service to retrieve 
his messages. In many cases, the recipient will be online at the same time 
as the sender and may respond immediately. The immediacy of IM makes 
it more like having an online chat.
Instant messaging is a push technology. That means that the messages 
are pushed out to the recipient if he or she is logged in; it doesn’t require 
the recipient to do anything to check for new messages. In contrast, 
email is a pull technology, because the recipient must actively check for 
messages in order to pull the new messages to his computer. (The email 
client can be set to automatically check for new messages at certain inter-
vals, so the email messages may seem to be arriving on their own, but it 
is actually the client software pulling them.)
Instant messaging requires you to have IM client software installed 
for the service you are using. For example, Yahoo! Messenger’s client 
software for Windows appears in Figure 14.3. Other instant messag-
ing clients include AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) and Microsoft Lync 
(formerly known as Microsoft Office Communicator). IM client software 
is available for Mac, Windows, and Linux operating systems, plus several 
smartphone and tablet operating systems.
Some instant messaging services include voice and even video chat 
capabilities, as well as picture sharing. Including these features takes the 
applications beyond simple instant messaging, into the realm of Voice 
over IP (VoIP) and videoconferencing, both of which are covered later in 
this chapter.

475
Chapter 14: Online Communication
You can also send 
and receive instant 
messages on smart-
phones using a tech-
nology called Short 
Message Service 
(SMS), which goes 
through your cell 
phone provider’s 
network. This type 
of messaging is 
called texting.
The differentiation 
between SMS and 
IM messages can 
get blurry because 
services are avail-
able that can cross 
the platforms. For 
example, some IM 
services offer clients 
for certain smart-
phone operating 
systems, and there 
are computer-based 
applications that can 
send and receive 
SMS messages. If 
you use one of these 
services, it may not be obvious how the message delivery will be billed (that 
is, whether the messages count as SMS messages toward your cell phone 
plan’s text message allowance, or whether the messages use the phone’s 
Internet data plan), so monitor your usage carefully until you are sure.
Short Message Service (SMS) The text 
messaging technology used on cell phone 
networks.
texting Sending and receiving short text mes-
sages in real-time over a cell phone network.
Figure 14. 3  Yahoo! Messenger’s client software for Windows 
enables you to have one-on-one text chats with others.
WhatsApp
Depending on your cell phone plan, you may only get a certain number of SMS text messages per month. If you find 
yourself running out of SMS messages each month, consider using WhatsApp Messenger, a cross-platform smart-
phone application that can send text messages using your phone’s Internet data plan, bypassing the phone’s SMS 
service. You are still sending text messages, but you’re doing so through an Internet server, so you aren’t charged 
per message, but only for the small amount of Internet data used. WhatsApp is available for iPhone, BlackBerry, 
Android, Windows Phone, and Nokia. WhatsApp was originally developed by a very small company, but was pur-
chased by Facebook in February 2014, giving it a much broader audience and greater financial backing for future 
development.
New Technologies
Some IM clients allow group chats, but they are normally with people 
whom you specifically invite. In contrast, many public or semi-public 
chat rooms enable you to have group conversations with people you 
may not know. Many websites include chat room software on some of 
their web pages that anyone can log into to participate in a group chat. 
For example, a recovery support site for alcoholics might have a group 
chat every night at a certain time.
chat room An online virtual room in which you 
can meet and talk to other people.

476
Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
The largest system of public chat rooms is Internet Relay Chat (IRC), 
with about 400,000 users worldwide. IRC is a system of chat servers 
that users log into using IRC client software. The user can then select a 
channel, which is a chat room for a particular subject of discussion, and 
enter the channel to join the conversation.
Social Networking
Social networking is an umbrella term for sites such as Facebook, 
Twitter, LinkedIn, and Google+, in which users can post information 
about themselves and create groups of people with shared interests with 
which to chat and exchange ideas and web links.
Each user creates a profile, which can include details about her  
location, job, family, and interests. Social networks grow organically 
by friends inviting friends who in turn invite or include their own 
friends. Users are able to post and comment on photos and videos 
published to the network, share links, send each other emails, and 
conduct web chats.
Some social networks make extensive use of tags. These are search-
able labels that can be added to posted content allow other people to 
find like-minded users and join interest groups, fan pages, and more. 
However, these self-applied tags are also useful to marketers and enable 
them to target potential customers far more accurately. Information 
sharing and access to people’s private information has thus become an 
important area of debate. On Twitter and some other services, tags are 
preceded by hash symbols (#) and are referred to as hashtags.
Some social networks are specialized. You might use Instagram to share 
photos, Vine for video clips, Reddit for news snippets, and YouTube for 
video-sharing. Other networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, are more 
general but allow you to cross-post updates to and from other social 
network sites.
One reason social networks are so successful is that they have accom-
panying mobile apps, so it’s easy for users to post updates and read 
posts from their smartphones or tablets. Many apps let you log in using 
your existing Twitter or Facebook details. This makes for a convenient 
user experience and is also useful to the app developers and Facebook/
Twitter as a mechanism for promotion.

Careers in IT
Social Media Marketer
A social media marketer specializes in helping companies promote themselves using social networking tools such 
as blogs, social networks, and microblogs, including Twitter. Their purpose is to increase public awareness of the 
company and its products. The role requires marketing expertise and a thorough understanding of how search 
tools work and how to call attention to the client companies. Using this knowledge, the social media marketing 
person adds keywords and hashtags to the content they create. This helps the client company’s web pages appear 
more prominently and frequently in search results and rank higher in page rank indexes. The process of writing 
content in this way is known as search engine optimization (SEO). Marketing and business skills and professional 
courses in SEO marketing are expected for such a role. A successful social media marketer will demonstrate her 
expertise by maintaining her own use of social networks.

Chapter 14: Online Communication
Blogs and Microblogs
A blog (originally called weblog) is a web page where an individual or group 
publishes stories, essays, or articles that are generically referred to as posts. 
Blog posts differ from websites that contain news stories and marketing 
information in that they are personal and often opinionated in nature. 
Whereas a news story is objective, a blog post may put forth a point of view 
or an extended commentary. Some blogs are similar to personal diaries, but 
others are run by users with specialist knowledge of a topic they want to 
share with other people. A blog owner is likely to engage directly with read-
ers who comment on the topic and follow the blog.
Popular blogs with lots of followers and comments can be highly influ-
ential in their sphere of expertise. Social media tools such as Twitter and 
Facebook (www.facebook.com) are used to promote posts and get 
more people to contribute to the commentary.
Companies often use blogs to share news about forthcoming product 
launches and ideas they are working on. A blog of this type may be part 
of a company’s website. For example, Microsoft hosts several official 
blogs written by employees in various departments to let the public know 
informally about what its teams are working on for future products and 
services. Figure 14.4 shows the Extreme Windows blog, for example, 
found at http://blogs.windows.com, which highlights advanced-
level technologies for Windows.
Figure 14.4  Although blogs are best known for containing individual writers’ personal 
stories and opinions, some blogs are corporate-sponsored, like this one.
Many individual bloggers use a blog platform, which is a free or low-
cost blog-hosting website. Some of the most widely used blog platforms 
are WordPress, Typepad, and Blogger. These platforms act as the web 
host and offer customizable design templates as part of the blog. For a 
small additional fee, extra features are available, such as the capability to 
use your own domain name.
blog A web page containing the author’s personal 
experiences and opinions.
post An article published on a blog.
blog platform A web server that hosts the blogs 
of individuals, either free or for a small fee.
search engine optimization (SEO) The 
process of writing web content so as to increase a 
page’s ranking in online search results.

478
Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
Microblogging is a form of blogging that allows users to post brief text 
commentary or post photos and audio clips. On Twitter (the best-known 
microblogging platform), each post (called a “tweet”) can be no longer 
than 140 characters. This restriction is intended to keep updates interest-
ing and make people think about the essence of what they’re trying to 
say. Some updates are used to link to blog posts the users have written or 
to online articles they’ve found interesting and want to share or discuss, 
as in Figure 14.5, while others serve as a means for people in the public 
eye to communicate with their fans.
Figure 14.5  Twitter is used by all sorts of people and organizations to promote themselves 
and to comment on events.
Unlike email, microblogs can be seen by anyone and can be commented 
on by anyone, though people must usually register with the service to 
comment. To address a post to someone, put an @ sign in front of the 
username. To find a topic of interest, you can search within the blog-
ging platform. To make a post more likely to be found, you can add a 
# (hashtag) indicating the topic. Figure 14.6 shows a search for items 
tagged “Wimbledon.”
The best-known microblogging platforms are Twitter, Tumblr, and 
Google+. Video and photo-sharing sites Vine and Instagram can also be 
thought of as microblogs, because users generally post a photo or a video 
clip with a caption and then invite comments.
Smartphone and tablet apps for microblogging sites enable users and 
followers to view new posts and get notifications about them or about 
replies to their own posts. Relevant and interesting posts are reposted by 
followers to their own followers, thereby helping to promote the origi-
nal post. A particularly significant tweet from a prominent public figure 
might be retweeted thousands of times.

Wikis
A wiki is an online database of information that any user can copy or 
amend using a web interface. Wikis are usually set up so users can col-
laborate and share information and knowledge. If someone has addi-
tional information related to the wiki’s content, he can add it to the wiki. 
Wikipedia is the best-known example of a wiki; it is a form of online 
encyclopedia created by and edited by web users. Figure 14.7 shows the 
Wikipedia web page that describes a wiki.

Newsgroups
Newsgroups were created long before the web and were the forerun-
ners to the web-based forums we use today. These groups are part of a 
system called Usenet, which is a global distributed discussion system. 
Usenet users read and post messages to various categories known as 
newsgroups. Discussions are stored as threads, which follow a particular 
topic. Posts are not stored on individual servers; they are stored on a set 
of distributed servers that form part of the Usenet network. Newsgroup 
servers are connected to each other to form a network. Newsgroups have 
their own protocol for accessing the posts, called NNTP (network news 
transport protocol), which transports news articles between news servers 
and clients reading and posting articles. The client computer needs an 
application called a newsreader to read Usenet articles, or needs to use 
an email client that supports news reading.
Newsgroups usually focus on a particular topic of interest, but some 
groups allow postings on any topic. Discussions are not held on the 
servers indefinitely and typically will disappear after a few months. 
Newsgroups have declined in popularity as other forms of online com-
munication have come to prominence, but there are still more than 
100,000 active groups.
Forums
Web forums are a more sophisticated type of newsgroup. A forum is 
hosted on a standard website and can be accessed using any web browser. 
Many forums have a question-and-answer format in which members 
request advice from other forum members. Comments and replies to a 
post create a forum thread. Forum threads are saved and archived so 
that other users can easily find the answer to the same or similar question 
in future. You don’t always need to become a forum member in order to 
find useful advice on a forum or to search its threads, but you must join 
in order to create a new post and ask a question or start a discussion.
If you’re looking for advice on a brand or product, try typing that prod-
uct name plus the word forum into a search engine. For example, if you 
wanted to buy a new digital SLR camera, you might use a search engine 
to find answers to the question Which DSLR camera under $500 shall I 
buy? Your search results may include a link to a forum thread covering 
this topic at www.photography-forum.org (see Figure 14.8). You 
could then read everyone’s comments and advice on the matter, but you 
would need to join the forum to contribute to the discussion.
Forums are often set up by interest groups and cover every aspect of 
life—from hobbies to transport, technology, health, and so on. Other 
forums are hosted on a company’s website so customers can request help 
with support issues and get advice from other customers and from tech-
nicians within the company. On many forums, users can give a thumbs-
up to a post to show appreciation for it and to increase the poster’s 
forum rating.

VoIP
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is used to make voice calls via 
the Internet by turning the voice message into small packets of data. IP, 
short for Internet protocol, is used to identify individual devices that are 
connected to the Internet and to route calls between them. For more 
detail at how IP addresses work, refer to Chapter 15, “Web Basics.”
Making VoIP calls requires a reliable web connection with plenty of 
bandwidth. This bandwidth is needed in order to translate your voice 
into bits of data, transmit it to your friend, and then reassemble it in the 
correct order so what you said makes sense. On slower web connections, 
this process may not work so smoothly and the caller’s speech may sound 
garbled or have delays.
VoIP calls can be made from your computer using a SIP (session Internet 
protocol) client and a URI (unique resource indicator), but it’s far 
easier—and much more common—to use a VoIP service such as Skype, 
FaceTime, or an IM client that also allows you to make voice calls, 
such as Yahoo! Messenger. VoIP calls can also be made from a tablet or 
smartphone using a VoIP app. Skype, Facebook Chat, and Truphone are 
popular VoIP apps. Google users in some countries can also make calls 
from their Google accounts just by clicking on the name of the person 
they want to call.
VoIP was originally designed for making web-based phone calls, but the 
advent of much faster broadband and fixed-line Internet connections has 
made it possible for the web to carry video calls too. Not only has VoIP 
become so dependable that many offices have replaced their telephone 
systems with VoIP-based ones, but it is now also routinely used for cor-
porate videoconferencing.
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) A 
means of providing web-based telephony. The 
best-known example is Skype.
Skype A Microsoft-owned VoIP service used to 
make phone calls and sometimes video calls 
over a broadband, Wi-Fi, or cellular mobile web 
connection.
FaceTime An app installed on Apple iPhone 
and iPad devices that is used to make video calls 
between Apple device owners.

482
Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
Skype is the most popular VoIP service in the world. Skype began as a 
VoIP service for making free computer-to-computer calls, but can also 
now be used to make cheaper international calls from a smartphone and 
for one-to-one video calls. Other VoIP services work in a similar way to 
Skype, but they don’t all have video calling options.
To use Skype, download the software client from www.skype.com. 
Then use the software to create a user profile for inclusion in the Skype 
database so others who might want to call you can find you. You can also 
use your email contacts list and call anyone on it who also uses Skype. 
Skype is part of Microsoft, so if you already have an Outlook, Messenger, 
or Hotmail account, you can sign in with those credentials. You can also 
sign in with your Facebook account details. A commercial version of 
Skype enables you to add a Skype phone number that non-Skype sub-
scribers can use to call you.
To use Skype for VoIP calls on a computer or laptop, you need built-
in speakers and a microphone, or to use an external microphone and 
speakers or a headset. To make video calls using Skype, you also need 
a webcam. You can also make calls using a Skype app on your tablet or 
smartphone.
Videoconferencing
Most video calls you make using Skype or another video calling app 
involve one person at each end of the line. Videoconferencing is a 
multi-party version of the video call, as in Figure 14.9. An advan-
tage of videoconferencing is that meetings can be held without the 
need for participants to travel, saving travel time and associated costs. 
Videoconferencing is also becoming prevalent in education: Online 
lectures can be delivered, backed up with video-call–based mentoring 
sessions.

a video conversation remotely using an Internet 
connection and the webcam or camera on your 
laptop, phone, or tablet.

483
Chapter 14: Online Communication
Videoconferencing uses the same underlying protocols as VoIP uses, but 
it requires much more bandwidth. Corporate videoconferencing facilities 
can cost many thousands of dollars to set up, but the costs are quickly 
recouped because hotel bills, travel expenses, and time out of the office 
are not required. Companies such as Cisco and Polycom provide video-
conferencing telephony equipment. Microsoft Lync provides a phone 
and laptop-based videoconferencing service that companies can sign up 
their employees to use.
Videoconferencing can be far more effective than phone-based meetings 
because relevant graphics can be shown and because participants can see 
each other and interact in real-time.

Communicating Appropriately
The way you express yourself online is just as important as choosing the 
best means of communicating. The language and tone you use can be 
chatty, friendly, respectful, or persuasive. You should always choose the 
appropriate medium and tone to fit the occasion and relationship with 
your intended recipient.
Professional versus Personal 
Communication
As the use of social media plays an increasingly larger role in our lives, it’s 
easy to fall into the trap of being overly familiar in your communication. 
When corresponding with people you don’t know well, or who are older 
or in a position of authority, address them formally and use polite lan-
guage. Avoid jargon and slang. Emoticons such as smiley face characters 
are also inappropriate in professional communication.
When sending professional communications, use a sincere but not overly 
friendly tone and diplomatic language. Avoid unnecessary capitaliza-
tion and exclamation marks. Read through what you’ve written before 
sending the document. Check spelling and grammar. Microsoft Word 
and other word processors have automatic spell-checkers and grammar 
checkers, but keep in mind they are not foolproof. If the document is a 
job application or a letter asking for a work experience placement, your 
written material will be scrutinized on these elements in addition to the 
content.
Personal communication also involves a measure of good judgment. 
Remember that jokes aren’t always appreciated; something you think 
is funny and friendly may inadvertently upset someone else. Emails and 
text messages can come across more negative than the writer intended. 

484
Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
Emoticons can help, but they can also be misinterpreted. If possible, talk 
to the person face-to-face or chat online. Verbal communication and 
IMs can be a lot friendlier and allow your tone of voice or, in the case of 
video calls or face-to-face chat, gestures and facial expressions, to help 
convey your meaning.
For any type of digital communication, avoid language that could offend 
on the basis of race, religion, disability, sexuality, or gender. A good rule 
for any form of communication is to ask yourself if you would be happy 
to see the message printed in a newspaper or another public outlet.
Verbal versus Written Communication
Online communication has become the standard contact method for 
many people, but a phone call or face-to-face conversation can some-
times be the better choice. When deciding between written and verbal 
communication, consider these factors:
◾	 With whom am I communicating? If you know someone well 
and the two of you regularly chat face-to-face and by email, a less 
formal means of communicating, such as an instant message or a 
Facebook message, could be fine.
◾	 What is the context or subject of the communication? If you want 
to discuss something serious or enlist someone’s help and support, 
verbal communication is often the best approach.
◾	 Am I likely to need a record of the communication? Written com-
munications are generally best when you need a record of proof. 
An email may suffice, but a legal document or formal notification 
or application may require a typed letter sent by regular mail ser-
vice. For business communication, address the recipient formally, 
using a courtesy title such as Mr., Mrs., or Ms., and use polite, 
respectful language.
◾	 Is the speed of communication important? Some people check their 
email and social media messages frequently; other people do so 
much less often. Check whether the person you want to communi-
cate with uses online communication regularly.
In any medium, stay calm and moderate your language, even if someone 
is criticizing you. Slang and profanities undermine any argument.
Choosing the Appropriate Online Medium
Using the right means of online communication shows you understand what 
message you want to get across and whom you are corresponding with.
The following checklist can help you choose the right medium for the 
particular occasion.

485
Chapter 14: Online Communication
Email
◾	 Suitable for most types of communication, especially if they are not 
time-sensitive.
◾	 Good for formal messages and communication with strangers.
◾	 Provides a permanent record of outgoing and incoming messages 
(unless, of course, you delete them).
Instant messaging
◾	 Ideal to get a quick answer to a question or for passing small 
amounts of information between colleagues.
◾	 Useful for quick updates with friends.
Social networking—personal
◾	 Appropriate mainly for your personal world.
◾	 Useful for informing your network of friends what is happening in 
your life, not necessarily work related.
◾	 Good for posting photos and videos of recent events you’ve been 
involved in.
Social networking—business
◾	 Increasingly used for advertising and business promotion.
◾	 Many social networking sites are dedicated fully or in part to 
matching job-seekers with potential employers.
Blogs
◾	 Ideal for expressing personal opinions and providing updates about 
yourself publicly as well as to your friends.
Microblogs
◾	 Best for very short summary updates you want existing followers to 
see and that can also be found by anyone searching for you or for 
the topic you cover.
Forums
◾	 Best for discussing topics of shared interest and communicating as 
part of a community.
VoIP calls
◾	 Useful for chatting with friends or business associates. Requires a 
reliable, high-speed web connection and use of the same VoIP ser-
vice. Works well for families keeping touch around the globe using 
phone or video.
Videoconferencing
◾	 Appropriate mainly for the workplace or schools and colleges so 
groups can interact visually.
Choose your communication method carefully, understanding the ben-
efits and drawbacks of each channel. Tailor your communication to what 
you need to accomplish and with whom you communicate.

Using and Managing Email
Email is the online communication method you will probably use the 
most in your daily work, school, and personal life. As you learned earlier 
in this chapter, you can access your email using a web interface or you 
can use an email client application. In the following sections, you’ll learn 
how to use Microsoft Outlook 2010, the email client that comes with 
the Microsoft Office suite of applications that you have studied in earlier 
chapters. The general principles are the same no matter which email cli-
ent you use, though, such as setting up accounts, sending and receiving 
mail, and organizing messages into folders.
Setting Up Email
When you install an email client, the Setup utility offers to set up your 
email account. You can add more email accounts later, though, in the 
same email client so that you receive messages from multiple accounts 
in a single Inbox folder. Each time you send an email, you can choose 
which account it will be sent from. If you are using a web-based email 
interface, you do not have to set up your account; logging in with your 
correct email address and password is all that’s needed.
CAUTION
When you sign up for an email account, you will be asked what password you want to use. Make sure you 
choose a strong password. A strong password is one that is difficult to guess; it may include a combination 
of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numerals, and symbols. A strong password should be fairly long (at 
least eight characters) and should not match any word in the dictionary or any common phrase or number 
sequence.
strong password A password that includes 
a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase 
letters, numerals, and symbols, making it difficult 
to guess.
Some email clients can automatically configure some types of accounts 
without your having to enter the technical settings for them (such as the 
incoming and outgoing mail server names and the account type). When 
you set up an email account, Outlook attempts to determine the correct 
settings for that account automatically. It doesn’t always succeed, so you 
may need to manually configure the account settings. The following 
Step by Step exercise shows the steps for setting up a new account in 
Outlook 2010.

Step by Step
Setting Up a New Account Automatically in Microsoft Outlook 2010
Follow this procedure to set up a new account in Outlook 2010 by allowing Outlook to automatically detect the correct 
settings to use. Try this method first:
	 1.	Click File, and click Add Account. The Add New Account dialog box opens.
	 2.	Fill in your name, email address, and password in the fields provided. Then click Next.
	 3.	If you see a box asking whether to allow a website to confirm server settings, click Yes.
	 4.	If a message appears that the account has been successfully configured, click Finish, and you’re done. If, on the 
other hand, a message appears that the account cannot be automatically configured, click Cancel and then see 
the next section.

488
Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
Setting Up a New Account Manually in Microsoft Outlook 2010
Follow this procedure to set up a new account in Outlook 2010 manually. Use this method if the previous method has 
failed, or if your account has some special settings that email clients in the past have failed to detect.
	 1.	Click File, and click Add Account. The Add New Account dialog box opens.
	 2.	Click Manually Configure Server Settings or Additional Server Types, and click Next.
	 3.	On the Choose Service screen, accept the default of Internet Mail and click Next.
	 4.	On the Internet Email Settings screen, fill in all the requested information. You will need to know the incoming and 
outgoing mail server names; if you don’t know these, get that information from your email provider.

489
Chapter 14: Online Communication
	
	 Note: By default Outlook creates a new data file for each email account you set up. If you want the new email 
account to use an existing data file (for example, outlook.pst), select the Existing Outlook Data File option button and 
then browse for the data file. This is an issue only for POP3 accounts, IMAP accounts store the mail on the server.
	 5.	Click Next. Outlook tests the settings by sending and receiving a message. If both incoming and outgoing tests 
show Completed, click Close and then click Finish; your settings are correct.
	
	 If, on the other hand, you see a message that Outlook cannot connect to either your incoming or outgoing mail 
server, click Close and then click More Settings to open the Internet Email Settings dialog box.
	 6.	Use the options in the dialog box to configure your 
settings as directed by your email service provider. For 
example, here are some common settings you might 
need to change:
◾	 On the Outgoing Server tab, select the My Outgoing 
Server (SMTP) Requires Authentication check box.
◾	 If your email provider has told you that you need an 
SSL connection, on the Advanced tab, mark the This 
Server Requires an Encrypted Connection (SSL) check 
box.
◾	 On the Advanced tab, change the port numbers for 
the incoming and/or outgoing servers to the numbers 
that your email service provider has specified.
	 7.	Click OK, and then return to Step 5 to recheck your 
settings.
Receiving Email
Once the account is set up, your email client will automatically start 
using it. Your email address and password are stored, and you will not 
have to enter them again.
NOTE
If you are using Outlook, and if you followed the Step by Step exercise in the preceding section to set up the 
account, the first message you will probably receive is the test message you sent yourself. You may also 
receive other messages too, and you can send yourself additional test messages for practice.
The navigation pane in an email client typically appears on the left and 
shows a list of mail folders, with one of them being Inbox. The Inbox 
folder is where incoming mail appears by default. Nearly all email clients 
work this same way, with a navigation pane at the left. There are also 
folders there for Outbox (where outgoing messages wait to be sent), 
Sent (where copies of the messages you send are stored), and Trash 
(where deleted messages are stored). There may also be a Junk Email 
folder, where incoming messages that the email client classifies as junk 
mail are placed. Figure 14.10 shows these in Outlook 2010. Note that 
unread messages appear in bold in the list of messages.

490
Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
Figure 14.10  The Inbox in Outlook 2010 with received messages.
Also in Figure 14.10, notice that Outlook 2010 provides a reading pane, 
which shows the content of the selected message. When you use a reading 
pane, you do not have to open a message (by double-clicking it) to read 
its contents; you can preview that content just by selecting the message in 
the list. The Reading pane can appear either on the right or at the bottom 
of the window; you can control its setting on the View tab. Other email 
clients typically also have a reading pane. A web interface may or may not 
have one.
Your email client is probably set to send and receive message automati-
cally at certain intervals, such as every 10 minutes. If so, messages will 
appear in your Inbox throughout the day, as long as your email client 
is running. You can also manually initiate a send/receive operation. To 
do so in Outlook 2010, click the Send/Receive All Folders icon on the 
Quick Access Toolbar (above the File tab).
Sending Email
To send a message in Outlook 2010, click the Home tab and click New 
Email. Or, in another email client, click the equivalent button, which 
may have a slightly different name (like New or Compose). A message 
composition screen appears. Fill in the information as prompted, as 
shown in Figure 14.11, and then click the Send button.

email accounts set up in your mail client, you may be prompted to 
choose which account the message will be sent from.
◾	 To: Put the recipients’ email addresses here. If there is more than 
one recipient, separate the names with semicolons. You can also 
look up recipients from a stored address book in your mail client; 
in Outlook, addresses are stored in the Contacts list.
◾	 Cc: If you want to send an informational copy of the message to 
someone, put that person’s email address in the Cc field.
◾	 Bcc: This field might or might not appear. A Bcc is a blind copy—
in other words, a copy that other recipients are not aware is being 
sent. In Outlook 2010, this field doesn’t appear by default, but if 
you click the To or Cc button, a dialog box appears in which you 
can select or enter Bcc recipients along with To and Cc recipients.
◾	 Subject: This is the title of the message, which will appear in the 
recipient’s Inbox list. The subject should be short but descriptive; 
avoid general subject likes like “Hi” or “Info.”
◾	 Body: This is the area where you type the main part of the 
message.
Working with Attachments
Email you receive may have attachments, which are files that travel along 
with the text of the email. You can also send attachments with emails you 
send yourself.

492
Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
When you receive a message with an attachment, a symbol may appear 
on the message in your Inbox to indicate its presence. In Outlook 2010, 
the symbol is a paperclip, as shown in Figure 14.12.

To open an attachment, double-click it. To save it to your hard 
drive, right-click it and choose Save As (for one) or Save All 
Attachments (for all).
To send an attachment yourself, as you are composing the message, 
look for an Attach button or command. In Outlook 2010, an Attach 
File button appears on the Ribbon. Click it and then follow the 
prompts to attach the file(s).
The following Step by Step explains how to compose and send a 
message in Outlook 2010 that contains an attachment.

493
Chapter 14: Online Communication
Step by Step
Composing and Sending an Email that Contains an Attachment in Outlook 2010
Follow this procedure to use Outlook 2010 to send an email that contains an attachment:
	 1.	Click the Home tab, and click New Email. A new message composition window appears.
	 2.	Enter the recipient(s), the subject, and the message in the fields provided.
	 3.	Click the Attach File button on the Ribbon. The Insert File dialog box opens.
	 4.	Select the file(s) to insert and then click the Insert button.
	 5.	Click Send to send the message.
Working Around Attachment Size Limitations
Email providers have specific (but varying) limits to overall size of emails and their attachments. Larger files (such 
as video clips) will be rejected and prevent the email containing them from being delivered. If you want to send a 
large file, try compressing it first. You can do this by right-clicking the file in Windows Explorer and choosing Send 
To ➪ Compressed folder. If it still exceeds your email provider’s limit, it’s better to send a link for your friend to 
download the item. You can use an FTP service or upload a file to OneDrive or Dropbox (online storage services you 
can use for free) and send your friend a link to download it. This can also be preferable because large emails take 
longer to send and use up a large chunk of the recipient’s mailbox.

Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
Working with Stored Contacts
Outlook 2010 is a full-featured contact management application, and it 
includes separate sections for email handling, contact management, and 
calendars. All these sections are connected, though, so you can use them 
together. The contact management section is called Contacts. To view 
it, click Contacts in the lower-left corner of the Outlook 2010 screen. 
Figure 14.13 shows the Outlook 2010 Contacts list with three contacts 
in it. When you first open the Contacts list, you may not have any con-
tacts there. You can create some if you like by clicking the New Contact 
button and filling out the form that appears.

people’s contact information.

to change how the contacts appear.
When addressing an email message, if you know the person’s email 
address, you can type it directly into the To, Cc, or Bcc field. As you 
start typing, the email client’s autocomplete feature may offer to fill in 
the address for you. You can also select from your Contacts list, as shown 
in the following Step by Step.

Chapter 14: Online Communication
Step by Step
Addressing an Email Message from the Contacts List in Outlook 2010
Follow this procedure to look up email addresses in the Contacts list as you are composing a new email in Outlook 2010:
	 1.	Click the Home tab, and click New Email. A new message composition window appears.
	 2.	Click the To button. The Select Names: Contacts dialog box opens.
	 3.	Click the name of the person to whom you want to address the email.
	 4.	Click one of the buttons at the bottom of the dialog box to indicate the appropriate field in which to place the 
person’s email address: To, Cc, or Bcc.
	 5.	Repeat Step 4 to add more recipients if desired.
	 6.	Click OK to return to the message composition window and complete the email as you would normally.
CAUTION
Make sure you don’t share others’ contact information without permission. If you’re sending an email to 
multiple people, and you don’t want them to see each other’s addresses, put your own email address in the 
To field and then put all the recipients’ addresses in the Bcc field.
Responding to and Forwarding Emails
When you receive an email, you can choose to reply to it by creating a 
new message, but it is often easier to use the Reply feature in your email 
client. When you select a message and then choose Reply, the mail client 
starts a new message for you that is pre-addressed to the original sender, 
with the original subject in the Subject line preceded by RE: and the 
original message quoted in the message body. This saves time because all 
you have to enter is your reply. Figure 14.14 shows a reply being com-
posed in Outlook 2010.
Reply A message that is sent back to the original 
sender.

Figure 14.14  A reply includes the original subject and message body, and the original sender is set as the recipient.
The Reply All feature works just like Reply except it addresses the message 
not only to the original sender but also to any co-recipients on the original 
message. (It does not include recipients who got their copies through Bcc.)
To send a message you’ve received from one person to someone else, use 
the Forward feature. When you forward a message, the original subject 
appears in the Subject line, preceded by FWD:. The original message 
body appears in the body area, and if the original message contained any 
attachments, they are included as attachments in the forwarded email 
too. Everything is filled in for you except the new recipient. Fill in the 
new recipient in the To box and send the message.
Out of Office/Automatic Replies
If you know you won’t be responding to emails for a few days, it’s polite 
to set up an out-of-office message. When people send you an email, 
they’ll get an automatic response explaining that you are out of email 
contact at present but will attend to their messages as soon as you return.
A good out-of-office message should include the dates that you will be 
gone and an alternative contact person who can be reached in case of an 
urgent matter.
For example, here is a typical message:

Chapter 14: Online Communication
Out-of-office messages are set up on your mail server, not in your email 
client. That’s because when you are out of the office, your email client soft-
ware won’t be running, so you can’t count on it to handle the automatic 
reply.
In some cases, you may be able to set up automatic replies through your 
email client. It depends on the incoming mail server. If you are using a 
Microsoft Exchange mail server (for example, through your company’s 
network at work), you can use the Automatic Replies feature in Outlook 
2010. Click File, and click Automatic Replies. If you don’t see that com-
mand after clicking File, you can’t use automatic replies in Outlook.
To set up an automatic reply on your mail server, log into your mail 
provider’s website, or log into your hosting account if the email account 
you are working with is part of a domain you own. In the provider’s 
configuration pages online, you will find a feature that will enable you 
to set up an out-of-office message. You may also be able to set up an 
automatic reply in the web-based interface for your account, as shown in 
Figure 14.15.
automatic reply A feature on a mail server that 
automatically sends a message back to each one 
received when it is enabled.
Figure 14.15  It may be possible to set up an automatic reply in the web interface for your email account.
Signatures
Rather than typing your name at the end of each email you send, you can 
append a signature that is added automatically. This can include your 
Skype name, mobile phone number, Twitter handle, blog address, or 
other information. You set up a signature in your email client. The fol-
lowing Step by Step section shows how to set one up in Outlook 2010.
signature Text that is automatically appended to 
outgoing messages.

Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
CAUTION
Be conservative with the information you put in a signature line if you are using the same email account for 
both business and personal email. You might write a formal email address to a business client, for example, 
and forget that you have something very informal and silly in your signature.
Step by Step
Creating a Signature in Outlook
To create a signature in Outlook, follow these steps: 
	 1.	Select File ➪ Options ➪ Mail. Under Compose Messages, choose Signatures. A Signatures and Stationery menu 
appears.
	 2.	Click New, type a name for a new signature, and click OK.
	 3.	Type the text for the signature in the Edit Signature area. Use the formatting tools above the text entry area to for-
mat the text as desired.
	 4.	Repeat Steps 2 and 3 as needed to create additional signatures if you want different signatures for different 
accounts or situations.
	 5.	Open the E-mail Account drop-down list and choose an email account for which you want to set a signature.
	 6.	Open the New Messages drop-down list and choose the signature you want to use for that email for new messages, 
or choose (none) to turn off signatures.
	 7.	(Optional) If you want to use a signature for replies and forwards, open the Replies/Forwards drop-down list and 
choose the signature you want to use, or choose (none) to turn off signatures.
	 8.	(Optional) Repeat Steps 5–7 to configure additional email accounts if desired.
	 9.	Click OK.

Chapter 14: Online Communication
Archiving Emails
Your email client keeps emails indefinitely, so over time the data file for 
your email client may become very large. The larger the data file, the 
longer it takes for the application to open, and the longer it takes for 
some operations, such as searching. A large data file also takes longer to 
back up.
One solution is to delete the old emails, and it’s a good idea to do so 
if there are emails that you know you will never want to refer to again. 
However, there’s another way to keep your email data file small: You can 
archive old messages to a separate data file. That way, you can open that 
archive any time you need to refer to older mail, but your old mail isn’t 
in your mail client taking up space on a daily basis.
Some email clients have an Archive command that you can use to 
automatically archive items that meet certain criteria. Other clients 
require you to create archive files manually and move content into them 
manually by dragging and dropping content from existing folders to 
the archive folders. Outlook 2010 has a very good archiving feature, 
explained in the following Step by Step.
archive To move items from the current location 
to another for backup purposes; a useful way of 
storing old messages while freeing up space for 
new ones.
Step by Step
Setting Up AutoArchiving in Outlook
To set the defaults for automatic archiving, follow this procedure:
	 1.	Click File, and click Options.
	 2.	Click Advanced.
	 3.	In the AutoArchive section, click the AutoArchive Settings 
button.
	 4.	In the AutoArchive dialog box, adjust the default settings as 
desired. For example, you can choose where to move old items 
to, and how old an item must be before it is archived.
	 5.	Click OK.
Opening an Archive
To review archived content, follow these steps:
	 1.	Click File, click Account Settings, and click Account Settings.
	 2.	Click the Data Files tab, and click Add.
	 3.	 Select the data file containing the archive and click OK.
	 4.	Click Close. Now the archive data file appears in the navigation pane at the left, below your main Outlook data 
file's folders.

Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
Setting up AutoArchiving for Specific Folders
To set the AutoArchiving options for specific mail folders, follow these 
steps:
	 1.	Right-click the folder in the navigation pane and choose Properties.
	 2.	Click the AutoArchive tab.
	 3.	Choose Archive the Items in This Folder Using the Default Settings.
	
	 OR
	
	 Choose Archive This Folder Using These Settings, and then adjust the 
settings as desired.
	 4.	Click OK.
Manually Archive (One-Time Operation)
If you would prefer to retain control over archiving, do it manually, rather than setting up automatic archiving. Follow these 
steps:
	 1.	Click File, click Cleanup Tools, and click Archive.
	 2.	In the Archive dialog box, select a folder to archive, or to 
archive all folders, select the parent folder at the top of the 
list.
	 3.	Choose a date from the Archive Items Older Than pop-up 
calendar.
	 4.	Confirm the archive file name in the Archive File text box.
	 5.	Click OK.
Managing Junk Mail
Junk email, also called spam, is sent out by the millions of messages 
every day on the Internet. By some estimates, it accounts for more than 
80 percent of all email sent. Mail filtering software helps cut down on the 
number of unsolicited ads you receive by analyzing your incoming mes-
sages and applying message sorting rules and filtering to them to deter-
mine which ones are ads and which ones are legitimate correspondence. 
Using mail filtering software can save you lots of time because you don’t 
have to go through large amounts of junk mail to find the important 
messages sent to you.
spam Unsolicited “junk” mail, typically containing 
offers (some legitimate, some not) of products or 
services to buy.

501
Chapter 14: Online Communication
There are several ways to filter junk mail. Many email applications 
include a junk mail filter that automatically moves messages it suspects to 
be spam into a Junk Mail folder. You can periodically look through that 
folder to see if there is anything you want, and then delete the rest.
Many ISPs also offer junk mail filtering. This type of filtering is typically 
invisible to the end user; the mail that’s filtered out never even reaches your 
email client software. Because of the danger of missing a legitimate message, 
this type of filtering is usually very conservative in its targeting of junk mail.
Third-party junk mail filtering programs can work with your email client 
and can be fine-tuned for the level of filtering you are most comfortable 
with. Some people prefer to get more junk mail in order to be assured 
they aren’t missing any legitimate messages, whereas other people prefer to 
enable the most aggressive junk mail filtering settings. Some filtering soft-
ware can even get better over time by learning from the choices you make.
When you identify a piece of junk mail, you can add its sender to a 
blacklist. Any further mail from that sender will be automatically dis-
carded upon receipt. If you want to make sure that you always receive 
mail from a certain recipient, regardless of your junk mail settings, you 
can add that address to a whitelist, also called a safe list. Whitelisted 
senders will always have their mail delivered to your inbox.
In Outlook 2010, you can control your 
junk mail options by clicking the Junk 
button on the Home tab and then 
choosing Junk Email Options from the 
menu. In the dialog box that appears 
(see Figure 14.16), you can choose a 
level of filtering and choose whether 
junk mail will be deleted or stored in a 
Junk E-mail folder.
blacklist A list of prohibited email senders.
whitelist A list of allowed email senders; also 
called a safe list.

Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
Summary
Internet Communication Types
The Internet has fostered many means of communication, and it is important to choose the cor-
rect medium for a situation. Email is like postal mail for computers; it is not instantly delivered, 
using a store-and-forward system that employs mail servers to move the mail from place to place 
and a mail client to pick up one’s mail.
Some email accounts are web-based, also called HTTP email accounts. Most people use them via 
web interfaces. There are also Post Office Protocol (POP) and Internet Mail Access Protocol 
(IMAP) accounts, which are both designed for use with mail clients. POP and IMAP proto-
cols are only for receiving email; they are both paired with the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol 
(SMTP) for sending mail.
Instant messaging (IM) consists of instant text messages sent over the Internet. When instant 
messages are sent over phone systems, it is called texting or Short Message Service (SMS). IM is 
a push technology, whereas email is a pull technology.
Chat rooms are like group instant messaging. You signal your willingness to participate by enter-
ing a chat room, such as a channel in an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server.
Social networking is an umbrella term for sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and 
Google+. Users can post their own text and pictures and express their opinions. Tags (hashtags) 
are used to identify topics. Some common social networks are Instagram, Vine, Reddit, 
YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.
A blog is a web page where an individual or group publishes posts, which may contain news, 
opinions, photos, and essays. Blogs can be either personal or commercial. A blog platform 
is a service that enables people to create their own blogs and hosts the blogs on its server. 
Microblogging allows users to post brief text commentary, photos, and audio clips. Twitter is the 
best-known microblogging site.
A wiki is a collaboratively managed database of information. Wikipedia is the largest and most 
popular wiki. Newsgroups are no longer very popular, but used to be extremely so; they are pub-
lic message forums exchanged through a service called Usenet. To read in newsgroups, you use 
newsreader software. A forum is a web-based public discussion area.
Voice over IP (VoIP) is a technology for making voice calls over the Internet. These calls can also 
include video, through services such as Skype and FaceTime, or an IM client that includes video 
chat capabilities. Videoconferencing is a multi-user version of video chat.
Communicating Appropriately
Because there are so many means of online communication, the appropriate tone and language 
need to be chosen for each. More formality is typically expected in business communication than 
in social networking. Poorly written communications send out the wrong message and can be 
misinterpreted, leading to conflict. Face-to-face communications and phone calls are preferable to 
online exchanges in some circumstances because non-verbal communications methods, including 
gestures and tone of voice, can be used to ensure the message is correctly conveyed.
Using and Managing Email
Email is sent and received through an email client or a web interface. Microsoft Outlook is one 
of the most popular email clients. When you set up a new email account, make sure you choose a 
strong password, which is a password that is not easy for someone to guess.

503
Chapter 14: Online Communication
To get started with an email client, you set up your account(s) in that program. Your messages 
then appear in the Inbox, and you can compose your own messages from that program’s interface. 
The Inbox may include a reading pane, which shows the content of the selected message.
When composing email, you must enter a recipient, a subject, and a message body. You may 
optionally include an attachment. When addressing email, the To box is for the main recipients, 
Cc is for those who will receive a copy, and Bcc is for those who will receive an undisclosed copy. 
You may optionally select recipients from the Contacts list in Outlook (or equivalent in your email 
application).
Most email clients enable you to save email addresses of people with whom you correspond and 
use them when addressing messages. In Outlook, this is the Contacts list.
You can reply to a received message by clicking the Reply button; other options include Reply All 
and Forward.
An out-of-office message sends an automatic reply to anyone who emails you while you are 
away. You can set this up in Outlook only if you use an Exchange server. Otherwise, you must set 
it up with your mail provider. You may be able to configure it from the web-based interface that 
the provider supplies for your email account.
A signature is text that is automatically appended to outgoing emails. You can set this up in your 
mail client.
To avoid having your mail file get too big, you can periodically archive messages, which means to 
transfer messages to an auxiliary storage folder based on criteria you specify.
Unsolicited junk mail, also known as spam, can be minimized using mail filtering software, which 
may include both blacklists and whitelists.

The Impact of Social Networking
Social networking has become a major player in Internet communication and is now moving into 
the workplace. Look at your environment, school, college, or workplace and consider the impact 
of allowing social networking on the internal network. Ask yourself the following questions:
◾	 Would being able to use social networking during working hours affect productivity?
◾	 Can social networking replace existing communications in the workplace?
◾	 Are there disadvantages to using social networking in the workplace?
Discuss these questions with your colleagues and compare their views with yours.

How the Web Works
The Internet is a global network of millions of computers that can 
communicate with each other. Provided that two computers are con-
nected to the Internet, they can share information between them. The 
World Wide Web (WWW), often referred to as “the web,” is part of the 
Internet; it is network of interconnected pages of information stored on 
publicly accessible servers using a consistent page layout and formatting 
language. 
Web Browsing Components
Web browsing involves these three components:
◾	 Web servers: Store and provide access to web sites
◾	 Web browsers: Request and display information to individuals
◾	 Web pages: The individual documents that web servers store and 
web browsers request.
Web Servers
When someone connects to the Internet, he typically uses a computer 
with a desktop operating system, such as Windows 7. The informa-
tion accessed by that person, however, is stored on a different type of 
computer, called a web server. As you learned in Chapter 13, a server is 
a powerful computer that exists in order to provide data or services to 
other computers. A web server is a server on which web pages are stored 
and made available to the public.
Internet A global packet-switched network 
created cooperatively by multiple companies, 
governments, and standards organizations.
World Wide Web (WWW) A network of inter-
connected pages of information stored on publicly 
accessible servers.
web server A server that receives requests for 
web page data and supplies it by sending it over 
the Internet.
Careers in IT
Web Designer
A web designer creates websites for businesses, schools, organizations, and individuals. Web designers not only 
have a strong background in programming tools like HTML, Java, and ASP, but also an eye for what makes a page 
not only functional but attractive and easy to use. If you are interested in being a web designer, you will want to 
study computer technology, programming, user interface design, and computer graphics.
Web Browsers
A web browser, often referred to simply as a browser, is an applica-
tion used to access websites and to retrieve or upload information. The 
browser runs on an individual user’s computer and provides a communi-
cation interface to web servers.
web browser An application used to access 
websites and to retrieve or upload information. 
Often referred to as a browser.
NOTE
The relationship between a web browser and a web server is platform-independent, meaning that the hard-
ware and operating systems that each of them are using are irrelevant. They communicate using standardized 
languages such as HTML, so Windows, Mac, and Linux computers running a web browser can all communi-
cate equally well with a web server running UNIX, Linux, or Windows Server.
platform-independent An interaction between 
two computers in which the type of hardware 
and the operating system that each one uses is 
irrelevant.

509
Chapter 15: Web Basics
Many different browsers are available. The most popular ones include 
Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. All these browsers work 
in a similar fashion. Typically, if you know how to use one, you’ll be able 
to find your way around any of the others.
Internet Explorer comes preinstalled on computers that run the Windows 7 
operating system. To use a different browser, simply download it from the 
manufacturer’s website and install it. Note that certain web applications 
prefer certain browsers, so you may want more than one. You can have 
multiple browsers installed in Windows, and even have more than one open 
at a time. You’ll learn more about using a browser later in this chapter.
Web Pages
A web page is a file that is formatted for use on the World Wide Web. 
The content of a web page is displayed in a browser. Web pages can con-
tain a variety of content, including text, graphics, audio, and video.
Most Web pages are written in HyperText Markup Language 
(HTML), which defines the layout of a web page by using a variety of 
tags and attributes. Figure 15.1 shows some sample HTML code. When 
a web page is downloaded into a browser, the browser uses the instruc-
tions in the markup language to display the page as the page author 
intended. The codes in angle brackets, such as <title> in Figure 15.1, 
are tags. A tag tells the web browser how to treat the text that follows. 
Most tags are two-sided, meaning that whatever is between them will be 
formatted a certain way. For example, in <title>Wiley: Home</title>, 
the text Wiley: Home will be treated as the page title because it is sur-
rounded by an opening tag <title> and a closing tag </title>.
Figure 15.1  Sample HTML code.
Most web pages contain hyperlinks. A hyperlink, sometimes simply 
called a “link,” is a clickable link to another page (or another spot on the 
same page). The hyperlink is the main mechanism for navigating through 
web page A file formatted for use on the World 
Wide Web.
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) 
A language for encoding data and graphics for 
display in a web browser.
tag A bracketed code in HTML that tells a browser 
how to handle the text that follows it.
hyperlink A pointer to another point on a web 
page, which you access by clicking the hyperlink.

Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
a website. Each page on a website might have any number of links to 
content stored elsewhere on the site or even on another site altogether. 
When the mouse cursor changes from an arrow symbol to a hand, that 
indicates the presence of a hyperlink.
Some web pages are static. That is, its content does not change until 
its owner updates it manually. Other web pages are dynamic, providing 
frequently updating information, such as a current stock price or weather 
report. The site news.google.com, shown in Figure 15.2, provides 
news headlines that automatically update. If you open this page and keep 
it open, you will notice that the page reloads itself with updated head-
lines every few minutes.
Figure 15.2  The Google News page updates headlines automatically.
Understanding URLs and IP Addresses
You know what the main components of the Internet are. But how do 
users actually access the web pages they need online? This happens in 
large part due to the use of URLs and IP addresses.
URLs
A uniform resource locator (URL), sometimes called a web address 
or a uniform resource identifier (URI), is the set of characters you enter 
into your web browser’s address bar to navigate to a specific web page. 
uniform resource locator (URL) A string 
of characters that identifies the location of a 
resource on a website.

511
Chapter 15: Web Basics
An example of a URL is http://www.microsoft.com. If you type 
this URL in your browser’s address bar, your browser will display the 
main page of Microsoft’s website.
What makes up a URL? The full string of a URL is composed of three 
components:
◾	 The protocol: A protocol is a set of rules that govern the transmis-
sion of data between two devices. On the Internet, the HyperText 
Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is commonly used for this purpose—
hence the presence of http:// in most URLs. Another example of 
a protocol used on the Internet is the Internet Protocol (IP).
◾	 The destination server (domain name): This is indicated by a 
domain name, such as bbc.co.uk (you’ll learn more about domain 
names in a moment). In most cases, this domain name is preceded 
with the letters www followed by a period.
HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) The 
protocol used to send and receive web pages on 
the Internet.
NOTE
The letters preceding the domain name (such as www) represent the subdomain; they indicates the server 
(or area of the server) the data is on within the company or organization that owns the domain name. For a 
company with only one web server, it is customary to use www as the subdomain for a web server. However, 
companies with multiple servers may point to them by using different letters before the domain. For example, 
Google uses news.google.com, maps.google.com, images.google.com, and so on.
◾	 The path: This is the exact location of the file you are requesting 
on the server. For example, the document might be stored in a 
folder on the web server called news. A path might also include a 
specific filename, such as news/story24871.htm. If no filename 
is included in the path, a default page from the specified folder 
location loads.
A full URL would be http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/
story24871.htm. Figure 15.3 identifies each portion of the URL.
Figure 15.3  The URL explained.
NOTE
Notice the use of the forward slash as a separator. This is in contrast to the backslash used in Windows to 
describe a file path.
A domain name is a name that identifies an entity on the Internet. It’s 
a key part of a URL. A company or individual can register for a domain 
name. That name can then act as an identifier for that company or person.
domain name A name that identifies an entity 
on the Internet.

512
Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
In its basic form, a domain name consists of an identifier followed by an 
extension, like microsoft.com. The extension, also called the top-level 
domain, is often used to identify the type of organization that the name 
represents. For example, the .com extension represents a commercial 
organization, whereas the .edu extension is reserved for educational 
institutions, like harvard.edu.
Table 15.1 shows a list of the more common top-level domains. (Note 
that the list of available top-level domains is growing. For example, if you 
own a restaurant, your domain name could include the .food extension. 
Or if you are a doctor, your domain name could include the extension 
.doctor. For a list of available top-level domains, visit http://data.

training.microsoft.com or marketing.microsoft.com.
TIP
Companies that are global in nature should register their domains in multiple countries. For example, if you 
type www.microsoft.se, you receive Microsoft’s home page in Swedish.

Registering a Domain Name
For any company wanting to do business on the Internet or just have an online presence, choosing the right domain 
name is critical. Ideally, the domain name will match the company name as closely as possible. An exact match 
may not be possible, however, because the name may already be taken. If your company needs a specific name 
that is already taken, you may be able to buy the rights to that name from the current owner, or you may be able to 
register the name with a different top-level domain. For example, instead of a .com address, you might be able to 
get the .net or .biz version.
Anyone can register a domain name, as long as it doesn’t belong to an existing company or organization. You can 
register a domain name with a domain registrar company such as GoDaddy.com or 1&1.com. The exact cost varies 
with the registrar, but is generally between $10 and $30 USD a year.
The name registration must be renewed on a yearly basis, but you can pay for multiple years at a time. When the 
owner of a domain name fails to renew it, it becomes available for someone else to claim and register.

IP Addresses
Every computer that connects directly to the Internet has its own unique 
numeric address, called its IP address. IP stands for Internet Protocol, 
one of the protocols in the TCP/IP suite of protocols. A protocol is an 
agreed-upon rule or standard; the Internet is based on TCP/IP rules. 
Most networks today, including the Internet itself, use IP addressing to 
identify computers. If you connect to the Internet through an Internet 
Service Provider (ISP), your ISP assigns you an IP address automatically. 
Depending on the ISP, that address may be a static IP address (that is, 
permanently assigned to your modem) or a dynamic IP address (that is, 
temporarily assigned to your modem as long as it is connected to the ISP).
IP address A numeric address by which a par-
ticular computer is known on a network.
static IP address An IP address that is perma-
nently assigned to a device.
dynamic IP address An IP address that is 
temporarily assigned to a device.
Network Address Translation
Suppose your family has a single account with your ISP, but you have several computers that all need to share 
it. Your ISP assigns your modem (probably cable or DSL) a single IP address. Then you connect a router to the 
modem in your home. The router assigns its own private IP addresses to each computer, for them to use to com-
municate with one another, and it sets up the Internet connection as a gateway. When requests that should go out 
to the Internet reach the gateway, the router uses network address translation (NAT) to change the IP address on 
the outgoing message so that it appears to be coming from the IP address assigned to the modem. Then when 
the reply comes back from the Internet, the router changes the IP address back again to the address of the local 
PC. This is how many computers can share a single Internet IP address.
Put It to Work
There are two types of IP addresses currently in use. Their functionality 
is similar, but the addresses look completely different.
◾	 IPv4 address: An IPv4 address is a binary number made up of 
32 bits (binary digits). It is represented in dotted decimal notation. 
That is, the 32 bits are split into four groups of eight bits, and each 
block of eight bits is converted to a decimal number and separated 
by dots, like so: 131.107.23.100. There are more than 4 billion 
possible IPv4 address combinations. Although this number was 
deemed adequate when the Internet first appeared in 1969, it is 
no longer sufficient—hence the development of a new addressing 
scheme, discussed next.
◾	 IPv6 address: An IPv6 address is a much larger number. Made 
up of 128 binary bits, it has a maximum address space of 340,
282,366,920,938,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 addresses—
somewhat larger than the 4 billion with IPv4. Hopefully, with 
this scheme, we won’t run out of addresses again. The size of an 
IPv6 address makes it impractical to write it in the dotted deci-
mal format. Instead, IPv6 addresses are displayed in eight groups 
of four hexadecimal numbers separated by colons (:), like so: 
2001:0:0:635:7b62:12ab:34c2:1038. (A hexadecimal number is 
one that has 16 as its base rather than 10.)
IPv4 address An addressing system made 
up of 32 binary digits, represented as four 
decimal numbers separated by dots like this: 
131.107.23.100.
IPv6 address An addressing system made up 
of 128 binary bits, represented as eight groups of 
hexadecimal numbers.

Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
Running the ipconfig command displays your computer’s IP address, 
which is the private address assigned to it by your router. If you want 
to see your computer’s public address—that is, the one it uses on the 
Internet—visit http://whatismyipaddress.com. The main page 
will display your computer’s public IP address. There is also a map that 
shows the geographical location of your Internet service provider.
How Domain Names and IP Addresses Are Related
Suppose you want to visit a website on the Internet. That website—
like all websites—is accessible via its IP address. For example, suppose 
you want to visit Microsoft’s website. To do so, you could type its IP 
address—if you happened to know it. You probably don’t know it, 
though. Instead, you may know Microsoft’s site as www.microsoft.
com, its domain name.
If you enter an IP address in your web browser, the browser goes 
directly to that site. If you enter a domain name, though, it goes to a 
Domain Name System (DNS) server on the Internet, which is a direc-
tory lookup that converts domain names into their corresponding IP 
addresses. Looking up a name and finding the IP address is known as 
name resolution, or resolving the address. Your browser does this for 
you automatically.
Domain Name System (DNS) The naming 
system employed to enable users to access 
websites using their domain names or URLs rather 
than their IP addresses.
name resolution The process of translating 
domain names to numerical IP addresses. A DNS 
server is used to resolve a name to an address.
Step by Step
Identifying Your Computer’s IP Address
To discover your computer’s IP address, follow these steps:
	 1.	Click the Start button, type cmd into the Search Programs and Files box, and press Enter. A command prompt 
window opens.
	 2.	At the command prompt, type ipconfig and press Enter.
	 3.	Look for the line that includes “Local Area Connection.” You should see the two addresses allocated to your com-
puter—IPv6 first, followed by IPv4.

515
Chapter 15: Web Basics
The Internet contains thousands of interconnected DNS servers which 
collectively hold the entire Internet address directory. (Each server holds 
only a subset.) When you type a URL into your browser, your browser 
contacts a DNS server and finds out what the IP address is. It then uses 
the IP address to open up that page for you.

Accessing the Web with a Browser
As mentioned, you use a web browser to access content on the Internet. 
In this section, you’ll learn how to start your browser, access websites, 
navigate those sites, bookmark your favorite sites, and more.
NOTE
This section assumes you’re using the Internet Explorer browser, which is included with the Windows 7 oper-
ating system. Browsers are constantly being updated. When Windows 7 was launched, it included Internet 
Explorer version 8. The latest version of Internet Explorer (IE) at the time of writing, however, is version 11. If 
you have Windows Updates enabled (refer to Chapter 16, “Network and Internet Privacy and Security”), your 
system likely has the latest version.
Starting Your Browser
You can open Internet Explorer in a few different ways:
◾	 Click the Start button and select Internet Explorer from the list of 
programs (see Figure 15.4).
◾	 Double-click the Internet Explorer shortcut icon on your desktop 
(if there is one).
◾	 Click the Internet Explorer icon on your taskbar (assuming it’s 
been pinned there; see Figure 15.4).
◾	 Click the Start button, type iexplore into the Search Programs and 
Files box, and press Enter.
You can also start Internet Explorer (or your default browser, if not IE) 
by clicking a web hyperlink in an email address or document. In some 
programs, such as Microsoft Word, you have to hold down the Ctrl key 
as you click on a hyperlink to open it in a browser.

516
Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
Figure 15.4  Opening Internet Explorer from the Start menu.  
You can also see the Internet Explorer icon pinned to the taskbar.
When Internet Explorer opens, it takes you to your home page. Your 
home page is the page that is presented every time you open the 
browser. By default, the browser’s home page is msn.com. You can set 
your home page to the site of your choice, however. If you use a particu-
lar site all the time, you can set that site as your home page. This makes 
browsing more efficient.
home page The page that is displayed when you 
first launch your web browser.
Step by Step
Changing Your Internet Explorer Home Page
To change your Internet Explorer home page, follow these steps:
	 1.	Open Internet Explorer using one of the methods listed previously.
	 2.	Type the address of the website you want to set as your home page into the address bar and allow it to load.
	 3.	Click the Tools button (the one that looks like a gear wheel in the upper-right corner of the browser screen). A 
menu appears.

517
Chapter 15: Web Basics
Accessing a Website
After you launch your web browser, you simply type a URL in the 
address field to visit the site associated with that URL. DNS will resolve 
the URL to an IP address, and you will be presented with the page you 
specified. You can then click on hyperlinks on that page to see additional 
pages and information, or to visit other sites.
	 4.	Select Internet Options. The Internet Options dialog box 
opens, with the General tab displayed.
	 5.	In the Home Page section of the General tab, click the 
Use Current button. The box above it should now contain 
the URL of the current site.
	 6.	Click the Apply button. The next time you launch the 
browser, the home page you selected will be displayed.

Identifying Secure Sites
When you browse a website that uses the HTTP protocol, everything is transmitted and received in clear text. That 
means someone using a packet sniffer (discussed in Chapter 16, “Network and Internet Privacy and Security”) 
could easily intercept the information. This is okay for normal browsing, but not when carrying out financial trans­
actions that involve entering credit card information or other personal details.
To prevent criminals from acquiring your information, a secure encrypted connection is required when you are send-
ing sensitive data. HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) provides an encrypted connection between the web 
browser and the web server. With HTTPS, the two endpoints exchange an encryption key, enabling the encryption of 
all future communication between them. When a connection uses HTTPS, the URL starts with https:// rather than 
http://, as shown. In addition, a padlock appears in the browser’s address bar, and in some browsers the address 
bar may appear with a green background. A secure connection happens automatically when you log into a secure 
site; you do not have to do anything special to initiate it.
All sites that use HTTPS have a digital certificate that validates them as being trustworthy. This certificate is issued 
by a third-party certificate authority, such as Verisign. Certificates must be renewed on an annual basis, and can be 
revoked if questions about the company that holds it arise. To view certificate details for a site that uses HTTPS, click 
the padlock symbol displayed in the browser’s address bar and choose View Certificates from the menu that appears.

Chapter 15: Web Basics
Going Back, Going Forward, and Refreshing
Suppose that while visiting a website, you’ve clicked several hyperlinks 
to view many different web pages. Or maybe you’ve viewed additional 
websites during the same browser session. Either way, it may be that you 
want to revisit a page that you viewed previously. To do so, simply click 
the Back button in the upper-left corner of the browser window. (It’s the 
button with a left-pointing arrow on it.) This returns you to the page 
you viewed last. Click the button multiple times to cycle back to addi-
tional viewed pages.
When you click the Back button, the Forward button becomes active 
(that is, it turns blue). The Forward button is next to the Back button 
and features a right-pointing arrow. If, after clicking the Back button, 
you want to return to the original page, you can click the Forward 
button.
You can also refresh a web page. You might do so to make sure you are 
viewing the most current version of the page. (Sometimes, if you’ve vis-
ited a web page before, your browser saves it and reloads it the next time 
you visit. This helps to speed downloads but may result in an outdated 
page being displayed.) To do so, click the Refresh button. It’s the clock-
wise circular arrow at the right end of the address bar. Figure 15.5 shows 
the Back, Forward, and Refresh buttons.
Figure 15.5  The Back, Forward, and Refresh buttons.
Engaging in e-Commerce
One of the most important and culture-changing uses for the Web is as a means of conducting online financial 
business, also known as e-commerce. E-commerce can be business-to-business (B2B), business-to-consumer 
(B2C), or consumer-to-consumer (C2C). E-commerce can include a business ordering supplies or materials from 
another business, a consumer buying a book from an online bookstore, and a friend sending money to a friend.
From the consumer perspective, e-commerce is a win-win. Thanks to e-commerce, consumers have many more 
choices. Because e-commerce is global, people can buy from retailers all around the globe 24 hours a day, without 
leaving the comfort of their homes.
E-commerce makes economic sense for retailers as well. With e-commerce, there’s no need to maintain a brick-
and-mortar storefront. Online retailers can work from one or more large warehouses, selling and shipping a wide 
range of items.
With e-commerce, you aren’t limited to purchasing goods online. E-commerce covers all aspects of business and 
life. For example, many governments now offer services online, enabling citizens to pay their taxes, sign up for 
government services, and license their vehicles online.
When engaging in e-commerce, be sure you buy from secure sites. You’ll learn more about how to tell whether a 
site is secure in Chapter 16.

Working with Tabs
A tab enables you to have multiple web pages open at once within the 
same browser window. When you launch Internet Explorer, it displays 
your home page on a tab. To open another tab—leaving the page on the 
first tab accessible—click the New Tab button (the gray box to the right 
of the existing tab). A second tab opens, again with your home page 
displayed. You can then type a URL in the address bar to visit a different 
page as normal.
Perhaps even more useful, Internet Explorer enables you to open pages 
via a hyperlink on a separate tab. To do so, right-click the hyperlink and 
choose Open in New Tab from the menu that appears. Internet Explorer 
opens a second tab and displays the linked page on it. Figure 15.6 shows 
a browser window with multiple tabs open.

Adding Favorites (Bookmarks)
If you frequently visit a website, you might want to store it in your browser 
so you don’t have to type its URL every time you visit it. To do so, you 
can save it as a Favorite ( also called a Bookmark). A favorite is a website or 
page that you visit frequently, and to which you want easy access.
favorite A website or page that you visit fre-
quently, and to which you want easy access.
Step by Step
Adding a Website to Your Favorites List
To add a website to your Favorites list, follow these steps:
	 1.	Click the View Favorites, Feed, and History button in the upper-right 
corner of the browser screen. (It’s the one that looks like a star.) The 
Favorites Center pane opens. It has three tabs: Favorites, Feeds, and 
History. The Favorites Center pane also contains an Add to Favorites 
button.
	 2.	Click the Add to Favorites button. The Add a Favorite dialog box 
opens.
	 3.	Click the Add button to add the website to the Favorites tab.

521
Chapter 15: Web Basics
Another option is to add frequently visited websites to the Favorites bar. 
If enabled, the Favorites bar appears along the top of your browser win-
dow, just below the address bar. To enable it, right-click the title bar and 
choose Favorites Bar.
You can click a site in the Favorites bar to access it. Every new site you 
add to the Favorites bar will appear on the far-left end. When the bar is 
full, two small chevrons will appear on the right side of the bar, as shown 
in Figure 15.7. Click the chevrons to display a menu containing addi-
tional Favorites not visible on the Favorites bar.

	 2.	If necessary, click the Favorites tab to view your Favorites list.
	 3.	Click the link for the site you want to visit. Internet Explorer opens the site.
Organizing Your Favorites in Folders
If you collect a lot of favorites, you might like to organize them in the Favorites Center pane to make them easier to find. 
One approach is to place them into folders. For example, you could place all your news-related favorites in one folder, all 
your cooking-related favorites in another folder, and so on.
To create a folder for your favorites, follow these steps:
	 1.	With a site you want to add to your new folder open, click the View Favorites, Feed, and History button to open the 
Favorites Center pane.
	 2.	Click the Add to Favorites button. The Add a Favorite dialog box opens.
	 3.	Click the New Folder button. The Create a Folder dialog box opens.
	 4.	Type the name of your new folder and specify the folder’s location. (You can nest folders—create them inside one 
another—if required.) Then click the Create button.
	 5.	Click Add. The folder is created and includes a link to the website you have open.

Downloading and Uploading Content
Internet is a vast repository of data in the same way that a library is full 
of books. Some data is for onscreen consumption only, but much of the 
data is also downloadable.
When you click a hyperlink that points to a downloadable file, a dialog 
box may appear automatically inviting you to specify a file name and 
location on your local computer in which to save the file. You can also 
right-click the hyperlink and choose Save Target As (or an equivalent 
command, depending on the browser you are using). Some browsers 
automatically download files to a default Downloads folder, using the 
file’s default name, so you are not prompted for a name or location.
You can also upload content—that is, copy it from a desktop computer 
to a server on the Internet. You might do this to back up your data, stor-
ing it online on a personal storage site such as Microsoft OneDrive or 
Dropbox (also known as cloud storage). You can also use these sites to 
share data with others.

Another way to upload files for storage or sharing is to use the File Transfer 
Protocol (FTP). FTP is used solely for the transfer of files online. In the 
same way that there are web servers on the Internet, there are also FTP 
servers, maintained by businesses and individuals to enable users to upload 
and download files. Some of these are private, requiring a user ID and pass-
word; others are public, for distributing files that anyone may access.
You access an FTP site using a web browser in much the same way as 
a website; the main difference is that the address you enter into the 
browser starts with ftp:// rather than http://. You can also access 
an FTP site using an FTP application. FileZilla (www.filezilla-­
project.org) is a free FTP client that anyone may download and use. 
It is shown in Figure 15.11.

New Technologies
Using Web-Based Applications
These days, developers can use a number of programming languages to run web-based applications within a web 
browser. A web-based application is software that is downloaded and run within the web browser rather than being 
installed directly on the user’s computer.
A good example of a web-based application Outlook.com (previously called Hotmail). You use this program to read 
and write email messages. All the messages are stored on the server, not on your computer.
Web-based applications offer developers increased flexibility. Because they are browser-based, developers can 
build applications that work regardless of operating system. Web-based applications also alleviate concerns about 
local data storage. Finally, web-based applications are easier to update; there is no need to install and maintain 
applications on the local level. To capitalize on this new technology, many companies are moving to a subscription-
based model, where users pay a monthly fee to use it rather than purchasing it outright.

The answer to just about any question you may have is likely available 
on the Internet. The problem is knowing where to look to find it. This 
is where search engines come in. A search engine is an application that 
builds an index of sites on the Internet. Users can then search that data-
base using keywords or phrases to find sites that contain the information 
they need.

Conducting a Search
To conduct a search in Google, you type a keyword or phrase into the 
Search field and click the blue magnifying glass button on the right. 
Google returns a list of sites that contain information matching the 
word or phrase you typed. It also shows you how many matches Google 
found, and how long it took Google to conduct the search.
As shown in Figure 15.12, each entry in the list contains three pieces of 
information:
◾	 The title: This indicates the source of the information.
◾	 The URL: This is the web address for the page containing the 
information.
◾	 The text: Google shows an excerpt of the information, with the 
search words highlighted in bold.
To access a site that appears in the results, simply click it in the list.
The order in which the results are displayed depends upon multiple 
factors. One is relevance. The topmost result is, in Google’s estimation, 
the site that best matches the keyword or phrase your typed and is likely 
to provide the most informative answer. Subsequent results are likely to 
be less relevant. The excerpt shown for each result will help you decide 
which entry is most likely to provide the information you need.
Another factor that determines the order of results is money. Companies 
pay Google to ensure that when users conduct a search that’s relevant 
to their business, their page appears at (or closer to) the top of the list. 
Why? Because people who use search engines typically view only the first 
page of results. By ensuring their sites appear near the top of that page, 
companies increase the likelihood that their sites will receive more traffic.

Narrowing Your Search
Sometimes, you may find that a search yields too many results to be useful. 
To pare things down, try adding words to your search string. For example, 
if you type search for lapwing, Google finds over 337,000 results. If you 
search instead for lapwing nesting habits, the number of results drops to 
41,300, as shown in Figure 15.13. The longer the search phrase, the more 
likely it is to narrow down the results to a manageable number.

Chapter 15: Web Basics
Advanced Search Options and Features
Some search engines offer advanced search features, and Google is no 
exception. To access these features, type http://www.google.com/
advanced_search in the browser’s address bar. You’ll see a screen 
like the one shown in Figure 15.14. Fill in any of the relevant fields to 
narrow your search. For example, fill in the This Exact Word or Phrase 
field if you want to find pages that contain that text verbatim. Or, fill in 
the None of These Words field if you want Google to omit pages that 
contain that word from your search results. You can also narrow results 
by language, region, and more. After you enter all your search criteria, 
click the Advanced Search button to see a list of results.
Figure 15.14  The Google Advanced Search page.
Using Search Operators
Another way to narrow your search is to enter specific search operators 
in the Search field. A search operator is a word or symbol that has a spe-
cific function when carrying out a search. These operators tell the search 
engine to follow specific instructions when it carries out the search. 
Table 15.2 outlines the most commonly used search operators.

Evaluating the Accuracy 
of Web Information
The wonderful thing about the web is that anybody can create a website 
and publish her own information. The bad thing about the web is that 
anybody can create and publish her own information.
The web can provide answers to your questions, but how do you know 
how accurate or reliable this information is? To gauge this, consider the 
source of the information. If the information appears on a website hosted 
by a university, respected institution, or reputable company, it is likely 
that the information is accurate. If not, it’s possible that the information 
is accurate, but there is no way of knowing for certain. The information 
is only as good as its source. Information on an individual’s blog, for 
example, is not usually reliable information.
Keep in mind that many web sites are created with an agenda in mind 
that may conflict with providing objective facts. For example, someone 
selling a product may exaggerate the product’s benefits or post fictitious 
reviews, and someone promoting a certain political agenda may twist or 
intentionally misinterpret data to create an impression that supports his 
or her position.
Many web pages contain ads, and the ads are not always sectioned off 
separately from the main text; they may appear between the paragraphs 
of an article and might trick you into thinking they are part of the 
article. An ad is never a reliable source of information. Similarly, spon-
sored links are mini-ads that contain hyperlinks to other websites. Do 
not assume that a sponsored link is relevant to the topic of the article 
or that the author of the article even knows that the sponsored link is 
placed there.
Forums are public message boards that you access via websites. They 
may be sponsored by a particular company, such as a support forum for a 
certain kind of hardware or software, or they may be created and man-
aged by an individual. Because the posts on a forum are made by the 
general public, not by known experts, you must be cautious about apply-
ing any advice you read in forums. For example, a forum post might rec-
ommend that you download and install a certain file, but that file might 
have a virus or might cause compatibility problems on your computer. 
Some forums are monitored by official or unofficial representatives of the 
hosting company.
A knowledge base is a more reliable source of information. It is a 
set of articles provided and maintained by a company or government 
agency about their products. For example, Microsoft has a knowledge 
base in which you can look up officially approved articles about various 
Microsoft products.
Encyclopedia sites vary in their accuracy and reliability. Well-known ency-
clopedias such as Encyclopedia Britannica and World Book Encyclopedia 
may generally be thought of as accurate. However, many sites that appear 
to be encyclopedias at first glance are actually wikis. A wiki is a knowl-
edge base in which content is user-generated, so that anyone can post or 
sponsored link A hyperlink that is placed on a 
page because a payment has been made.
forum A web-based discussion and advice-
sharing site.
knowledge base A set of articles provided and 
maintained by a company or government agency 
about their products.
wiki A web-based application that can be edited 
by anyone and that is usually informational or 
instructive in nature.

534
Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
edit entries, even someone who is not an expert on the topic or who has 
an agenda to promote. The best-known wiki is Wikipedia (www.wiki 
pedia.org/). While Wikipedia is a good source of basic information 
on a topic, it cannot be trusted as a reliable source by itself, because of 
its nature; verify any information you learn from Wikipedia or any other 
wiki with other sources.
Wikipedia A free, online encyclopedia. Wikipedia 
is an example of a wiki.
Security and Privacy
Virtual Private Networks
Suppose you work for a company that has a head 
office and several remote sites. The company wants 
to connect the sites to form one network, and also 
to allow staff to work from home using the com-
pany network. However, they don’t want to go to the 
expense of running secure dedicated network cables 
between each person’s home and the company 
headquarters.
Virtual private networking (VPN) enables a user to create a secure connection to a remote server by going 
through the Internet. A VPN creates a secure tunnel, or pipeline, between a VPN-enabled web server and an indi-
vidual computer. This tunnel is very difficult to hack, so the connection is safe enough to use for sensitive data.
To connect to a VPN using Microsoft Windows, open the Network and Sharing Center (right-click the network icon 
in the notification area and choose Network and Sharing Center, or go through the Control Panel). From there, 
click Set Up a New Connection or Network, and click Connect to a Workplace. Choose Use My Internet Connection 
(VPN), and then follow the prompts to set up the connection, using the settings provided to you by the owner of the 
VPN server (your employer or school, for example).

of creating a secure, private communication tunnel 
using a public communications channel such as 
the Internet.

Summary
How the Web Works
The Internet is a global network of millions of computers that can communicate with each other. 
The World Wide Web (WWW, or the web) is one part of the Internet; it is network of intercon-
nected pages of information stored on publicly accessible servers. Web pages are stored on web 
servers, and accessed by web browsers. A web page is a file that is formatted for use on the web. 
A web server is a server on which web pages are stored and made available to the public. A web 
browser is an application that can display web pages. The relationship between a web server and a 
web browser is platform-independent.
Most web pages are written in HyperText Markup Language (HTML), a coding language that 
includes bracketed tags that tell the browser how to display the content. A hyperlink is a clickable 
link to another page.
A uniform resource locator (URL) is the address you enter into your web browser’s address bar 
to navigate to a specific web page. A URL consists of a protocol, a domain name, and, optionally, 
a path following the domain name.
A domain name is a name that identifies an entity on the Internet. It’s a key part of a URL. In its 
basic form, a domain name consists of an identifier followed by an extension, like microsoft.com. 
The extension, also called the top-level domain, is often used to identify the type of organization 
that the name represents. Some domain names also include a two-letter country code.
Every computer that connects to the Internet has its own unique numeric address, called the IP 
address. Two types of IP addresses are currently in use: IPv4 addresses and IPv6 addresses. An 
IPv4 address is a binary number made up of 32 bits. It is represented in dotted decimal notation. 
There are more than 4 billion possible IPv4 address combinations. An IPv6 address is made up of 
128 binary bits, and has a maximum address space of 340,282,366,920,938,463,374,607,431,768,
211,456 addresses.
Domain Name System (DNS) is the naming system employed to enable users to access websites 
using their domain names or URLs rather than their IP addresses. The process of mapping domain 
names to IP addresses is called name resolution and is done by DNS servers.
Accessing the Web with a Browser
To open Internet Explorer, use the shortcut on the Start menu or the taskbar, or click a web 
hyperlink in a document. The page that opens by default is the home page. Click on a hyperlink 
to go to a web page. Use the Forward and Back buttons to navigate between pages you have 
recently visited. Use the Refresh button to reload a page, or use the Stop button to stop a page 
from completing its loading. Internet Explorer enables you to have multiple tabs open at once, 
each displaying a different page.
To store a URL so you can easily recall it later, save it as a Favorite. IE maintains a list of recently 
visited sites called History. To access both favorites and history, click the View Favorites, Feed, 
and History button (which look like a star).
When you click on the hyperlink for a downloadable file, your browser downloads it, or prompts 
you for a filename and location to download it. To upload a file to a server, you can a web-based 
uploading interface, such as with Microsoft OneDrive, a type of cloud storage. You can also use 
the FTP protocol in your web browser (on some sites) or use a separate FTP application.

536
Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
A plug-in (also called an add-on) is a piece of software that can be added to a web browser to give 
it additional functionality, like the capability to view movies or Flash content. If you need a plug-in 
to play a certain type of content, your browser will prompt you to install it.
Using Web Search Tools
A search engine is an application that builds an index of sites on the Internet. Users can then 
search that database using keywords or phrases to find sites that contain the information they 
need. Examples include Google, Bing, and Yahoo!.
Sometimes, you may find that a search yields too many results to be useful. Search using multiple 
keywords to narrow down a search, or use search operators. Different search engines support dif-
ferent operators.
To gauge the accuracy of information you find on the web, consider the source of the information. 
Forums, ads, sponsored links, and blogs are all unreliable sources. Knowledge bases and official 
company sites are generally more reliable. A wiki may contain accurate information or not; it is not 
reliable.

Identifying the Path from Source to Destination
To see happens when you type a URL into a web browser to visit a web page, you can use the 
tracert command. It traces the path from the browser to the website, noting all the devices it goes 
through en route.
	
1.	Click the Start button, type cmd into the Search Programs and Files box, and press Enter. A 
command prompt window opens.
	
2.	At the command prompt, type tracert followed by the URL for the website of your choice 
(for example, www.bbc.co.uk) and press Enter. The command prompt window will list 
all the devices that your request travels through before it gets to the chosen destination. The 
program will also list the IP address of each device. When the process completes, the window 
will say “Trace Complete.”
As you can see, when you send the request, it leaves your computer, goes through your router, 
and then passes through a series of other devices between your browser and the destination. 
Notice that your request can probably get from one side of the world to the other in about 15 
stages or hops—sometimes fewer.

539
Chapter 15: Web Basics
Decoding URLs
When you visit a website, look at the complete path of the URL, including any folder names. Try 
different pages on the site and see if you can map how the site is laid out based on the different 
folder names you see.
Exploring DNS Name Resolution
DNS name resolution is a process that happens automatically whenever you type a URL into the 
web browser. This exercise enables you to see which DNS server you are using:
	
1.	Click the Start button, type cmd into the Search Programs and Files box, and press Enter. A 
command prompt window opens.
	
2.	At the command prompt, type nslookup, followed by the URL for the website you want 
to visit (for example, type nslookup www.google.com) and press Enter. The command 
prompt window lists the name and address of the DNS server you are using, followed by 
Google’s IP address. If you see more than one address in this part of the results, it means the 
DNS knows about five different Google servers. Your browser usually will go to the first one 
in the list, but if it is not available, your browser will go to the second, and so on.
Think It Over
Evaluating Web Browsers
Imagine you are working for an organization that uses Windows computers and notebooks. Users 
have been allowed to download any software they like onto these computers, including different 
browsers. This creates a problem for the support department, so your supervisor has asked you to 
evaluate possible web browsers so that all computers can be standardized with one program. What 
browsers might you evaluate? What features might you consider most important?
TIP
Try using tracert with www.disney.com as the target. As the request moves from 
device to device, see if you can identify the cities through which your request travels 
based on the names of the devices it passes.

Security Concerns
Computer crime is becoming increasingly common. It is relatively easy 
to attack computers to cause disruption or steal data. In fact, this can 
be carried out over a network or the Internet with low risk of the crime 
being traced back to the perpetrator.
Because of the ease with which attacks can be launched, it is essential that 
you remain aware of security and take the necessary steps to secure your 
data and online identity.
Computer security is built around upholding three basic goals:
◾	 Confidentiality. Your data should be visible and accessible only to 
those whom you choose to see it.
◾	 Integrity. The data you see and store should be reliable and 
accurate, and should not be tampered with. You need to be able to 
trust this data.
◾	 Availability. Your data should be accessible when you want it, 
including after a mishap or disaster.
The threat assessment and security measures discussed in this chapter 
center around the need to uphold these three goals.
Security Threats Posed by 
Computer Criminals
Computer criminals engage in many types of activities that can compro-
mise your computer system, your data, and your online identity.
Careers in IT
Security Specialist
Computer security is among the biggest growth 
areas in IT. With this comes a growing demand for 
engineers who have the skills to protect comput-
ers and networks. Security specialists are respon-
sible for ensuring that all the security devices in a 
company are correctly configured. These special-
ists must also be able to spot different types of 
attacks and know how to respond to each one.
To work in this area, you will need to master skills 
such as understanding operating systems and 
networks. You will also need good computer quali-
fications from a college or university, plus industry 
certifications from companies like CompTIA and 
EC Council. Finally, you will need experience in 
other areas of IT, such as troubleshooting and 
support, before you can move into this role.

Chapter 16: Network and Internet Privacy and Security
Phishing
One of the common threats—and one that is also easy to carry out—is 
phishing. In a phishing attack, offenders send email messages to unsus-
pecting users in an attempt to trick them into giving away personal 
information such as login details or credit card information. The attack-
ers then use this information to conduct fraudulent activity. This type of 
attack is often successful because the email messages appear to be from a 
trustworthy source, such as a bank or other reputable organization.
How does phishing work? Often, you will receive an email that appears 
to be from your bank. The email states that there is a problem with 
your account and it has been suspended. To reinstate your account, you 
must fill in the online form and submit your personal details. If you look 
closely, however, you’ll find that the email is not from your bank and the 
link to the form does not take you to the bank website—although it may 
appear as though it does. This is a very easy way for criminals to acquire 
information about account holders and, once they have it, to remove 
money from their accounts.
Such emails are not always sent under the guise of banks. They may 
appear to be from mobile phone providers, computer companies, or any 
other organization you may have an account with.
phishing The act of attempting to acquire infor-
mation such as usernames, passwords, credit card 
information, and so forth, by pretending to be from 
a genuine, trustworthy source such as a bank.
CAUTION
Legitimate banks and other companies will never send an email asking you to submit sensitive personal 
information online. Never click on the links in such emails. As a good Internet citizen, you should report the 
emails to the bank or other company to make them aware of the phishing attempts.
Phishing emails are getting more sophisticated and harder to recognize, 
but here are some considerations that will help you identify them:
◾	 Do you actually have an account with that bank or company? If 
not, then it’s reasonable to assume the message is an attempt at 
phishing.
◾	 Check the source of the email. Does the email address match the 
organization’s standard email address? Check not only the address 
that appears as text in the message, but also the address that 
appears as a ScreenTip when you point the mouse at it.
◾	 If you hover over the link to the company website with your 
mouse, it shows you the true URL. Is the address correct?
◾	 Are there grammar and spelling mistakes? Does the message appear 
in the language you would expect? Even if the body text is in the 
expected language, are there buttons or other details with text from 
another language? These are all indications of a possible attempt at 
phishing.
◾	 Check for the presence of the security padlock icon in the address 
bar. The presence of the security padlock icon is an indication that 
the message may be genuine—although it is not a guarantee.
Finally, remember that real companies and banks never ask for personal 
information in this way.

544
Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
CAUTION
In April 2014, security experts discovered a security bug that affected Internet users worldwide. Called 
“Heartbleed,” the bug placed around half a million of the world’s secure servers—the ones indicated by the 
aforementioned security padlock icon—vulnerable to attack, placing the servers’ private keys and users’ 
session cookies and passwords at risk. Most sites quickly patched the problem, but sensitive data for many 
users was vulnerable in the interim.
Figure 16.1 shows an example of a phishing email. The message 
claims to be from Apple, telling a user that his Apple account has been 
suspended.
Figure 16.1  An example of a phishing email.
Notice that the email is from service@id-appactivate.com. The address 
doesn’t end in @apple.com. If you were to click on the link to http://
facturation-apple.org (which you should not do if you suspect 
you have received a phishing email), you would see what initially appears 
to be the Apple login screen, as shown in Figure 16.2. The page may 
look authentic, but the URL indicates that it is not the official Apple 
website.
If you were to type your Apple username and password to log in (which, 
again, you should not do if you suspect the email is a phishing attempt), 
you would be taken to a page where you are asked to provide all your 
personal information, including your address, birth date, and full credit 
card details. (Do not be fooled into thinking that this screen is genuine

of MobileMe, which was discontinued in June 2012.)
CAUTION
Recipients of phishing email should delete them without opening them. If they do open the mail, they should 
not click on the embedded link.
Spoofing
When a computer connects to a network, it has several identities that are 
unique within that environment. It has a name and an Internet address, 
also known as the Internet Protocol (IP) address. In addition, the network 
chip in the computer has an address (known as a media access control, or 
MAC, address). A computer is granted access to a network as a legitimate 
device because its IP address is among those authorized for that network.
In a spoofing attack, the attacker’s computer assumes a false Internet 
address in order to gain access to a network. This type of attack is typi-
cally used by people who want to gain access to data but do not have a 
legitimate username or password to the network where the data resides. 
In that case, the attacker waits for a legitimate user to log in, and then 
hijacks that user’s IP address and takes over.
spoofing An attack in which a user pretends to 
be another by providing false IP address data.
by the presence of the padlock icon and the word “secure”; as noted, 
the presence of the padlock icon is no guarantee that the page is truly 
secure.) This gives the thief a complete, legitimate identity plus a credit 
card to use for illegal purchases.

546
Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
Packet Sniffing
When data is sent over a network, it is sent in multiple small packets 
rather than one large file. When you download a web page, you see the 
completed item on the screen, but in reality that one page might be 
composed of several hundred packets of data. The same applies to an 
Internet telephony program such as Skype. It takes upwards of 50 pack-
ets of data to carry one second of speech.
Sniffing is the capability to capture copies of data packets as they travel 
across the network and decode their content. Often, data sent over a net-
work or the Internet is unencrypted, so someone with the right software 
can capture and copy the packets that made up the data and decipher the 
contents.
In simple terms, the sniffer software draws a picture of what it sees and 
stores this data in a file. Figure 16.3 shows an extract from a sniffing pro-
gram called Wireshark. The snapshot identifies the address of the website 
that the user is visiting (Google.co.uk), the operating system (Windows), 
and the browser (in this case, Firefox). That’s a lot of information from 
just a few lines.
sniffing The act of intercepting and logging traffic 
over a network for future analysis. A sniffer can 
either be a software program or a hardware device.
Figure 16.3  A data sample captured by the Wireshark sniffer.
Password Cracking
When you log in to a computer or connect to an account on the 
Internet, you identify who you are with a username or number and you 
authenticate your identity, typically with a password. Passwords are the 
most common method of authentication because they are easy to use 
and maintain. Most systems and programs allow users to choose their 
own passwords, provided the passwords satisfy the system or program’s 
security policy.
It may be relatively easy to determine someone’s username. However, 
finding out someone’s password is often much more difficult. People 
who want to break into a system or account often attempt password 
cracking—that is, they attempt to identify a user’s password. Password 
cracking can be accomplished in several ways:
◾	 Guessing: The more you know about a user, the easier it is to 
guess his password. The most common passwords are based on 
the names of family members, but pets’ names, football clubs, 
birthdays, and other words are also common. People often choose 
passwords they can easily remember, but this practice can weaken 
security and help crackers.
◾	 Keylogger: A keylogger is a piece of hardware or a software pro-
gram that captures every keystroke a user types. A hardware keylog-
ger (see Figure 16.4) can be used to capture keystrokes sent from 
a physical keyboard to a computer, while a software keylogger can

capture keystrokes from a vir-
tual keyboard or other input 
device. When a user enters a 
password, the keystrokes are 
logged, and the password 
is captured for the attacker 
to use to gain access to the 
user’s account.
◾	 Social engineering: Social 
engineering is the art of 
obtaining someone’s pass-
word either by befriend-
ing her or tricking her into 
sharing it. Two classic social 
engineering methods are 
pretending to be an administrator who needs to know a password 
to fix a problem and sending a phishing email asking a user to fill in 
a form that requires her username and password.
◾	 Sniffing: As mentioned, sniffing is the practice of capturing data 
packets on the network. In many cases, when people enter their 
passwords, data packets contain those passwords in clear text. If the 
packets can be captured, the password can be discovered.
◾	 Password-cracking tools: Dozens of software programs are designed 
for password cracking. Different types of passwords (Windows logon 
passwords, Adobe document passwords, and website passwords, for 
example) require different password-cracking tools.
Malicious Programs
As noted in the preceding section, computer criminals engage in a wide 
variety of activities to compromise your computer system, data, and 
online identity. They are aided in their efforts by various types of mali-
cious software, grouped together under the title malware. This section 
outlines the main types of malware programs.
Viruses
A virus is a piece of malicious software that is installed without the user’s 
knowledge or consent. When executed, the virus program replicates and 
spreads to “infect” other computer programs, data files, or even the boot 
sector of the hard drive.
Viruses often carry a malicious payload. For example, a boot-sector virus 
might stop the computer from loading the operating system. Some 
viruses might delete all files of a certain type—for example, Word docu-
ments. Other viruses may simply have annoying consequences—perhaps 
opening and closing the CD drawer. Some viruses hide as long as they 
can so they can do as much damage as possible before being discovered. 
New viruses appear virtually every day, so it is vital that you take precau-
tions and protect yourself from them.
social engineering The art of obtaining 
someone’s password either by befriending her or 
tricking her into sharing it.
malware Harmful or maliciously created soft-
ware, such as a virus or spyware.
virus A type of malware that attaches itself to an 
executable file and spreads to other files when the 
program is run.

This model looks similar to a flash drive.

548
Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
The most common way for a virus to spread is for a user to open an 
infected email attachment or Internet link without having virus protec-
tion in place. This allows the malicious software to gain access to the sys-
tem. If the infected file is sitting in RAM memory and you run another 
program, the virus attaches a copy of itself to the second program—and 
so on and so forth.
Worms
A worm is similar to a virus in that it may have a malicious payload. 
However, worms are designed to automatically spread from computer to 
computer over a network or the Internet. Like viruses, the consequences 
of worms range from destructive to annoying. A worm might delete files 
or direct users to a fake website, or it might just do something annoying 
like swapping left and right mouse button actions. At the very least, a 
worm will consume network bandwidth.
worm A malicious computer program that 
spreads itself to other computers over a network 
or the Internet.
CAUTION
Some worms are designed to compromise the user’s email address book and send itself to all the user’s 
contacts. If you receive an odd or unexpected message from one of your contacts, it could indicate 
that her address book has been infected by a worm. Before opening the email, contact the sender to 
determine whether the email is legitimate and to alert her to the possibility that her machine has been 
infected.
Trojans
According to Greek mythology, the Greeks conquered the city of Troy 
through trickery. They constructed a large wooden horse, which they 
presented to the Trojans as a gift. Unbeknownst to the Trojans, however, 
the Greeks had hidden a select team of soldiers inside the horse. After 
the Trojans dragged the horse inside the city walls, the Greek soldiers 
emerged from the horse and opened the city gates, enabling the rest of 
the Greek army to swarm the town.
It is after this horse, called the Trojan horse, that Trojans are named. A 
Trojan is a piece of software, such as a game or utility, that may look 
innocent but has a malicious purpose. Typically, the user knowingly 
installs the game or utility, but doesn’t realize there’s a Trojan inside. 
When the user runs the program, the Trojan starts running in the back-
ground, often without the user’s knowledge.
A Trojan can do nasty things to a computer, but more likely it is there to 
gather information. For example, many Trojan programs are keyloggers. 
As described, a keylogger records all the keys the user presses on the 
keyboard and saves them in a file. It then sends the file with the user’s 
keystrokes to the person or group who sent the Trojan. In this way, 
whoever sent the Trojan can learn what the user does on the computer. 
More importantly, they can uncover the user’s username and password, 
enabling them to log in themselves.
A common type of Trojan is one that displays a screen that recommends 
that you purchase and download some type of anti-malware software, as 
shown in Figure 16.5. In this case, however, the software is fake and will 
probably put more Trojans on your computer. Worse, if you buy it, the 
thieves will then have your credit card details.

harmless but has a detrimental effect on a com-
puter when it runs.

Chapter 16: Network and Internet Privacy and Security

Ransomware
Some new, very nasty Trojans are called ransomware. These Trojans encrypt files on the system, such as pho-
tos, music, and documents. The Trojan then displays a message describing how to get the files back. Retrieval 
inevitably involves sending a payment over the Internet to an unknown destination with the promise that once 
the money is received, you will receive the key to unlock your files. The key doesn’t exist and the damage is 
already done, however. You will not get your files unlocked. Your best protection against ransomware is to 
frequently back up your system on an external hard drive. That way, if you fall prey to this type of Trojan, you can 
simply copy the files from your backup drive. You’ll learn more about backing up your system later in this chapter.
Privacy and Security

550
Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
Another type of Trojan runs spyware. Spyware is software that moni-
tors what the user does on the computer without her knowledge. It then 
sends the information it gathers to a third party, which uses it to target 
the user with pop-up advertisements—often for fake products.
Protecting Yourself against Malware
The earliest anti-virus programs were designed to detect and protect 
against viruses, but have improved over the years into broader security 
solutions that can detect viruses, worms, Trojans, and sometimes more 
complex threats. A good anti-virus package provides a wide range of pro-
tective measures and may include firewall management (discussed later in 
this chapter) and anti-spyware as well.
An anti-virus program aims to protect a computer against viruses in 
two ways. First, it contains a database of all known viruses; it can then 
compare the code in a program that your computer attempts to execute 
against this database. If the anti-virus software finds a match, it raises 
an alert and either removes the virus or puts the infected file in a special 
area where it cannot be accessed, or quarantines it. Second, the anti-
virus program looks at a program that is attempting to run and makes an 
intelligent guess as to whether it could be a virus. If the software thinks 
a program is a virus, it quarantines or cleans it, but this solution is not 
perfect. Sometimes anti-virus software raises a false alarm and removes 
a legitimate file, so you have to recover it manually. Still, this is a small 
price to pay for reliable protection.
Many good anti-virus products are in the marketplace: Symantec, 
Sophos, Kaspersky, and McAfee are among the most popular security 
solutions. They all work in a similar way and produce similar results. In 
addition, Microsoft has its own product, called Security Essentials. You 
can also find free anti-virus software, such as AVG (see Figure 16.6) or 
ClamWin. Free products usually have a more limited range of services 
than the commercial choices, but in some cases, you can upgrades to a 
paid version for expanded offerings.
Figure 16.6  Free anti-virus software.
spyware A type of malware that spies on the 
user’s activities and reports them back to the 
spyware’s developer.
ransomware A type of Trojan that encrypts files 
on a user’s system. It then displays a message 
describing how to decrypt the files—which inevi-
tably involves sending payment over the Internet. 
Even after the money is sent, however, the files are 
not decrypted.

551
Chapter 16: Network and Internet Privacy and Security
When an anti-virus product is installed, it provides real-time protection 
that checks files every time a user wants to run a program. The program 
will also do periodic scans of hard drives, checking every single file. See 
Figure 16.7. Most systems will carry out automatic scans and also allow 
manual scan runs at any time.
Figure 16.7  An anti-virus scan in action.
DoS Attacks and Zombies
In a denial of service (DoS) attack, the attacker floods a website or 
service with thousands of requests for access—so many that it cannot 
deal with them all. As a result, legitimate users are prevented from 
accessing the site or service. DoS attacks often involve many thou-
sands of computers from all over the world, all launching multiple 
requests against the target website or service, making them difficult to 
prevent. Once an attack is started, it can render the target site unavail-
able very quickly.
The computers that launch these attacks are called zombies. A zombie 
is a computer that has been infected with a particular type of Trojan 
called a bot. Initially, the bot runs in the background, doing very little 
beyond communicating with its master over the Internet every now 
and then, awaiting instructions. One day, it, along with thousands 
of other bots, receives instructions to bombard a particular website 
as part of a DoS attack. This is called a botnet. Millions of comput-
ers around the world are part of multiple botnets, all used for DoS 
attacks.
Wi-Fi Networks
Hackers frequently target Wi-Fi networks. When Wi-Fi networks are 
not properly secured, it is easy to steal data on them with little chance of 
being caught. Hackers don’t even need any special equipment to pen-
etrate such a Wi-Fi network.
denial of service (DoS) attack A coordi-
nated attack in which the target website or service 
is flooded with requests for access, to the point 
that it is completely overwhelmed.

attack.
bot A type of Trojan, used to infect a zombie 
computer to conduct a DoS attack.
botnet A network of zombie computers infected 
with bots, often numbering in the thousands. 
Computer criminals use botnets to conduct DoS 
attacks.

552
Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
When people use their devices 
to locate and connect to a 
wireless network, they see a 
list of available networks, as 
shown in Figure 16.8. Some 
of these networks may be open 
access, meaning you don’t 
need a password to connect. 
Others may require a password 
and will provide users with a 
secure connection. Insecure 
networks are identified with 
a small exclamation mark; the 
other networks have encrypted 
connections.
Some wireless networks 
appear to be genuine, but in 
fact attempt to intercept your 
traffic. These types of Wi-Fi 
networks are called rogue 
Wi-Fi. These Wi-Fi networks 
usually seem authentic, often with a name that is similar or the same as a 
legitimate network. The difference? This network “sniffs” all your traffic, 
making a copy of everything you type—including any usernames, pass-
words, and credit card numbers.
Public places where many people are looking for Wi-Fi, such as coffee 
shops, restaurants, and airports, are common locations for rogue Wi-Fi 
connections. How can you tell whether a Wi-Fi network to which you 
want to connect is in fact rogue? It’s not easy. If you are directed to a 
“Terms of Service” page after you connect, that’s a good indication that 
the network is legitimate. A time limit is another sign that the network 
may be genuine. But your best bet is to simply ask someone who works at 
the location whether it offers Wi-Fi, and if so, the name of the network.
Wireless Network Authentication
A wired network typically doesn’t have any special security that prevents 
someone from physically connecting to it. The switch or router to which 
someone might connect a cable is usually locked down in a closet or a 
special room in the facility to which only IT professionals have access, so it 
would be difficult for an unauthorized user to connect without permission.
With a wireless network, however, it’s a different story. Anyone within 
range of a wireless network may be able to see and connect to it. For that 
reason, there are several methods of protecting a wireless network from 
unauthorized usage.
A wireless network may be open (no security), or secure (having some 
type of encryption). If a network is secure, the first time a computer con-
nects to the wireless access point, a password prompt appears. The user 
must type the correct encryption key (password) in order to connect to 
the network. The encryption key is assigned and can be changed in the 
wireless access point’s setup utility.

including usernames, passwords, and credit card 
numbers.

NOTE
To access the wireless access point’s setup utility, use your web browser. Enter the IP address of the access 
point, and its configuration page will appear. If you don’t know its IP address, consult its documentation, or 
visit the support website for the device online.
Several systems of wireless network security have been developed over 
the years, each one an improvement over earlier systems in terms of secu-
rity level. Here are the most common ones, in order of oldest to newest 
(and most secure):
◾	 Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP): An older and less secure form of 
wireless encryption. An older and weaker form of wireless encryp-
tion. It is available in both 64-bit and 128-bit encryption key ver-
sions. (The more bits, the greater the security.)
◾	 Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA): A form of wireless encryption 
providing a 128-bit encryption key. A security system designed to 
overcome the weaknesses of WEP, providing an improved 128-bit 
encryption key.
◾	 WPA2: An improved version of Wi-Fi Protected Access that pro-
vides stronger protection with a 128-bit or 256-bit encryption key. 
An improved version of WPA that provides even stronger protec-
tion with a 128-bit or 256-bit encryption key.
To make it easier for devices to connect to home networks that use 
encryption, some wireless access points include a feature called Wi-Fi 
Protected Setup (WPS). A feature available on some wireless access 
points that enable a user to connect a device to a trusted network. This 
feature enables a user to connect a device to a trusted network by press-
ing a button on the wireless access point to temporarily place it into a 
mode that allows new connections, and then clicking an onscreen button 
in the operating system to complete the connection.
Another way to make a wireless network more secure is to set the wire-
less access point not to broadcast its service set identification (SSID), 
which is its name. By default, a wireless access point constantly broad-
casts its name so that computers that want to connect to it can find 
it. That makes it easy for computers to select it from a list of available 
networks. If you set it to not broadcast its name, only those who know 
its name will be able to find it and connect to it. You can set the wire-
less network’s SSID and choose whether or not to broadcast it from the 
wireless access point’s setup utility

Network and Internet 
Privacy Concerns
The Internet has changed the way people live, learn, and communicate. 
While the Internet offers enormous power to communicate and to find 
information, it also makes us more vulnerable to invasions of privacy. The 
Internet consists of vast amounts of data spread globally across millions 
of websites; thanks to the sheer size and scope of the Internet, it’s impos-
sible to know how all this information is stored and how private it is!
Here are just a few of the ways in which using networks and the Internet 
can put your privacy at risk:
◾	 When you use a search engine, the search engine site can gather 
information about you based on the terms you search for and the 
questions you ask.
◾	 When you provide personal information on the Internet—such as 
your name, address, email, and so forth—to a website, that website 
can store the information and perhaps use it for purposes other 
than those you intended.
CAUTION
Be aware of the personal information you make available online. That information may spread far beyond the 
sites you contact directly!
◾	 Your computer has a unique identity. Someone who knows this 
unique identity can access your computer via a network and view, 
change, or delete your personal data.
Data Storage
When you store data on your computer, you store it as files. As the num-
ber of files grows, it becomes harder to locate the data you want. This is 
where databases come in. A database stores data in a way that enables 
you to search for and locate it quickly.
There are millions of databases worldwide that, together, store billions 
of files. Often, these files contain information about individuals. For 
example, large companies have databases that contain information about 
their customers. Similarly, social networks like Facebook have huge data-
bases to store the information about their users. If these networks are 
vulnerable to unauthorized access, sensitive data for many people may be 
compromised.
Most of this data is stored by private companies, and we rely upon them 
to handle personal data with care. Everything should be based on the 
principle of least privilege—that is, you give people minimum access for 
the jobs they have to do. If you request data about yourself, that is all 
you should see—no one else’s details.
database A collection of data stored in a struc-
tured format, with the same facts stored about 
each instance. A database stores data in a way 
that enables you to search and locate it quickly.

Chapter 16: Network and Internet Privacy and Security
Privacy Laws in the United States
The United States has more than 25 data privacy laws, each dealing with different categories of data. Here are a 
few of those important privacy laws:
◾	 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA): This law includes provisions to ensure the 
privacy of medical records.
◾	 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act: This law governs the collection, disclosure, and protection of consumers’ nonpub-
lic personal information in financial institutions.
◾	 Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA): This law prevents unauthorized government access to 
private electronic communications.
Similar laws exist in different countries. More than 100 nations have specific privacy laws. Thanks to these laws, 
companies are prohibited from giving your information away to anyone who asks for it.
Privacy and Security
Privacy Laws
To protect people’s privacy, there are rules to govern how personal 
information is handled. Most countries have data protection and privacy 
laws to control the access and distribution of this personal information. 
These laws are needed to regulate the companies that hold our personal 
information and to ensure that all our information is properly protected.
Different countries have different rules, but most require that any per-
sonal information stored is:
◾	 Used only for the intended purpose
◾	 Accurate 
◾	 Sufficient for the purpose, with no unnecessary information held
◾	 Accessible by the owner
◾	 Obtained legally
◾	 Kept secure from unauthorized access
◾	 Deleted when no longer needed
Of course, just because there are laws designed to protect your privacy 
online does not mean that you shouldn’t take additional steps to keep 
yourself safe. For more information, read on.
Step by Step
Checking Your Online Identity
When you start using the Internet, you create an online identity. To get a sense of your online identity, try the following:
	 1.	Open your web browser and type www.google.com or the address of your favorite search engine.
	 2.	Type your name in the Search box and see what results you get. Do you see links to pages that contain informa-
tion about you?
	 3.	Click the Images link if the search engine provides one. Are there any pictures of you online?
The results may surprise you. Perhaps you find information about yourself that you would prefer were kept private. If you 
can see this information about yourself, so can anyone else!

556
Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
Understanding Social Networking Risks
A social network is an Internet-based system that enables users to inter-
act in real time and by using messaging programs. With a social network, 
users can share every aspect of their lives with others. Examples of social 
networks include Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
While sharing information via social networks can be wonderful, it is not 
without its risks. It is easy to get carried away on social networks and 
publish information about yourself that would be better kept private. 
Before you publish too much information about yourself, you must 
consider just who can see that data. After you have published it, it is very 
difficult—if not impossible—to remove it from the Internet.
social network An Internet-based system that 
enables users to interact in real-time and by using 
messaging programs.
cyberbullying Using computers and the Internet 
to deliberately harass or harm others by making 
malicious statements.
CAUTION
Never leave a computer or laptop without logging out of any social network sites you have open. If you remain 
logged in, someone else could post information while pretending to be you.
Social networks pose another risk—namely, that some of the “friends” 
you make online may not be who they say they are. Be careful how much 
you reveal about yourself to such people. Remember: A social network 
is global, your new “friends” could be anywhere, and some of them may 
ask you to do things you shouldn’t.
CAUTION
Never agree to meet someone you’ve met online in person unless you bring a friend with you for protection. 
Privacy and Security
Cyberbullying
Social networks have become part of our everyday lives—particularly among young people. Indeed, millions of 
young people spend time on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other social network sites, often to 
stay in touch with friends.
Sometimes, however, what starts as a fun activity—interacting with friends online—turns ugly. Someone makes 
unpleasant comments about you online. Others join the conversation. People might even post rumors or altered 
images of you in an attempt to harass you. This is called cyberbullying—and it’s a growing problem.
What should you do if you are being cyberbullied? The most important thing is to tell someone who can help. If 
you are being bullied at school or in the workplace, then your instructor or employer needs to know about it. He or 
she may be able to take action to stop it. Of course, telling others about the cyberbullying may be difficult because 
some of the comments may be hurtful or embarrassing. But it is important to let people know it is happening. You 
can’t just ignore it and hope it will go away. All that does is empower the bullies.
Deleting Cookies
When you visit some websites, they place a cookie on your computer. A 
cookie is a small file that stores information about your interaction with 
the website. When you revisit the site, the site reads the cookie on your

computer that stores information about the user’s 
interaction with the website.

computer to identify you. Figure 16.9 shows where cookies reside in a 
Windows system, while Figure 16.10 shows examples of actual cookies. 
Just one visit to a website can result in the installation of several cookies 
on your computer.

Figure 16.10  The cookies generated by visiting two websites.
While this can sometimes be handy—for example, for sites that you’ve 
personalized—it’s not always a good thing. For example, some cookies 
contain personal information that a hacker could use to gain access to 
a website while pretending to be you. The hacker could then use your 
PayPal or credit card information in a fraudulent manner, for example. Or, 
a hacker could trick you into downloading a Trojan that steals your cookies 
and sends them to the hacker’s computer, enabling him to use them at will.
To prevent this, you can delete cookies, and prevent your computer from 
storing them in the future. If you do so, the next time you go to a web-
site, it will not be able to identify you because there will be no cookies 
on your computer. While this may be frustrating on occasion—you may 
have to input information all over again—it can be a safer way to use the 
Internet. When you delete or disable cookies, you no longer leave a trail 
of information that others could use for malicious purposes.

Strategies for Improving Security
How can you improve security? Some of the work is done for you by 
operating system vendors, who typically add security features when they 
produce new versions of an operating system. For example, Microsoft 
Windows now has a built-in firewall, and Microsoft offers its own anti-
virus security products. The operating system is also more secure thanks 
to better login mechanisms and the presence of fewer vulnerabilities. 
There is still some work you can do, however. For example, you can 
restrict access to data, use encryption, protect against data loss, update 
your operating system, and more.
Restricting Access
Perhaps the easiest and most effective security measure you can take is 
to restrict access to the data on your computer. You can do this by using 
passwords, applying permissions, and enabling firewalls.
Using Passwords
When Windows is installed on a computer with only one user account, it 
does not require the use of a password to log in to the operating system. 
When you start the computer, it takes you straight to the desktop. That 
means anybody could start the computer and see what is stored on it as 
well as run programs without permission. This is not a good practice. 
What if someone rifled through your files until he found sensitive infor-
mation you’d rather keep quiet? Or what if someone were to use your 
computer to hack into a government network?
All this is to say that it’s critical to create a strong password for your 
computer. That way, no one who does not know the password can log 
in. A strong password should contain a mix of uppercase and lowercase 
letters, numbers, and special characters such as @ or #, and be difficult 
or impossible for other people to guess. An example of a weak password 
might be “manchester.” You could easily strengthen the password, how-
ever, by changing out some of the letters for other characters, like this: 
“M@nch35Ter.” You should, of course, create a password that you can 
remember, and also change the password on a regular basis.
Step by Step
Creating or Changing Your Password
To create or change a password on a Windows computer, follow these steps:

TIP
You should create similarly strong passwords for any accounts you create on the Internet. That way, you 
ensure no one “cracks” your password and accesses your online accounts.
Privacy and Security
Locking the Computer
If you’re logged in to a computer, you should never leave it unattended, even for a few minutes. If you do, someone 
could easily access your files, install a Trojan, or send an improper email as if it was from you. One simple security 
measure you can take to prevent this is to lock your computer when you are away from the machine.
You can lock your computer in one of two ways. One is to press the Ctrl+Alt+Del keys at the same time. You will be 
presented with an options screen; select the Lock This Computer option to lock the computer. Alternatively, press 
the Windows+L keys at the same time. To unlock the computer, simply enter your system password, as shown 
here.
Sharing Folders with Permissions
If your Windows computer will have more than one regular user, you can 
create a user account for each person. Each person’s data—his pictures, 
music, movies, documents, and so on—will be stored in his own user 
folder. As shown in Figure 16.11, only a folder’s owner can access the 
contents of his user folder. This is to help keep the data secure. A user 
can, however, choose to share some of his folders with other users on the 
computer, without granting access to all the data in his account. You can 
also share folders and files with other users over a network. This is done 
through the use of permissions.

561
Chapter 16: Network and Internet Privacy and Security
Figure 16.11  Trying to gain unauthorized access to a folder.
Before you start assigning permissions to share data with others, you 
should consider what you wish to share and how much access to allow. 
For example, you can set a folder’s or file’s permissions to give others 
access to its contents, but not allow them to change the contents. Or, 
you could set a folder’s or file’s permissions such that others can add, 
change, and/or delete items.
Step by Step
Setting Permissions on a File or Folder
To set permissions on a folder or file, follow these steps:
	 1.	Open Windows Explorer.
	 2.	Select the folder or file you want to share.
	 3.	Right-click the selected folder or file and choose Share With. A submenu appears.
	 4.	In the submenu, choose Specific People.
	 5.	The File Sharing window opens. Click the drop-down menu at the top of the window and choose Everyone or Find 
People. If you choose the latter, you’ll be prompted to find specific users with whom to share.

562
Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
	 6.	Whether you select Everyone or a specific user, Windows applies the default level of permission. To change it, click 
the appropriate entry in the list and choose Read or Read/Write from the menu that appears.
	 7.	Click Share to share the folder or file.
Be cautious when sharing folders and files with others. Give people only 
the level of access they need—and no more.
Using a Firewall
A firewall is a security barrier on your computer or network that con-
trols what traffic is allowed into and out of your computer or network. 
The barrier is designed to separate your computer or network, which you 
trust, from an external network, which you might not.
The firewall works from a set of instructions, or rules. It looks at every 
packet of traffic that attempts to travel through the firewall in either 
direction and decides whether to allow it or block it. Most firewalls come 
with a set of default rules, but they can be adjusted, enabling you to 
configure yours to allow or deny whatever traffic you choose. If you play 
computer games, for example, you may need to configure the firewalls 
on your router and your computer to allow the gaming traffic through.
Computers that run later versions of the Windows operating system 
include a firewall application by default, called Windows Firewall.
firewall A security barrier on your computer or 
network that controls what traffic is allowed to 
pass through.
Step by Step
Changing the Settings on Windows Firewall
To adjust the settings of Windows Firewall, follow these steps:
	 1.	Click the Windows Start button and choose Control Panel.
	 2.	In the Control Panel window, click the System and Security option.

563
Chapter 16: Network and Internet Privacy and Security
	 3.	In the System and Security window, click Windows Firewall. Windows displays the current status of your firewall. 
If the networks have green check marks, you are protected. If you see red X’s instead of the green check marks, 
your firewall is not running.
	 4.	To change the settings, click the Allow a Program or Feature Through Windows Firewall link on the left side. 
Windows will display a list of programs and note whether they are allowed or not.
	 5.	Click Change Notification Settings to modify the list.
NOTE
If you have a security software package installed, you may find that it has deactivated Windows Firewall in 
favor of its own firewall. For information about managing the rules of that firewall, see the security program’s 
Help files.
CAUTION
Do not disable the firewall unless you have another form of protection in place. If you don’t have an active 
firewall, your computer or network will be exposed to all sorts of threats that could damage your computer or 
cause you to lose files or data.
Encrypting Data
When you store data on a hard drive, the data is written such that it can be 
read by anyone who has access to the drive. That means if someone were 
to steal your computer, that person would have access to the data on your 
hard drive. Even if she did not have the password required to log on to 
your system, she could still access the contents of your hard drive simply 
by removing it from your computer and installing it on another machine.
Your data is vulnerable! Fortunately, there are ways to protect your data so 
that only you can access it. One method is to use encryption. Encryption 
involves using a mathematical process to scramble data to such an extent 
encrypt To scramble the contents of a file so it 
cannot be read without the required permission 
to decrypt it.

564
Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
it is impossible to read . . . unless you have the key. The key unscrambles 
or decrypts the data so that it is readable again. When you use encryption 
on your computer, you work as normal; the encryption and decryption 
processes take place in the background.
Windows has two encryption programs built into the operating system. You 
can encrypt individual files using the Encrypting File System (EFS) within 
Windows Explorer, or you can use a program called BitLocker to encrypt 
the entire hard drive if you have the Ultimate Edition of Windows 7.
decrypt To reverse the encryption of a file so that 
the file appears in its original form again.
Step by Step
Encrypting Individual Files Using EFS
If you only want to encrypt certain files, you can follow this process:
	 1.	Open Windows Explorer.
	 2.	Navigate to the file (or files) that you want to encrypt.
	 3.	Select the file you want to encrypt. To select multiple files, use the Shift or Ctrl key, as described in the section 
“Selecting Files and Folders” in Chapter 5.
	 4.	Right-click one of the selected files and choose Properties from the menu that appears. The Properties dialog box 
opens.
	 5.	In the General tab of the Properties dialog box, click the Advanced button. The Advanced Attributes dialog box opens.
	 6.	Select the Encrypt Contents to Secure Data check box.
	 7.	Click OK to close the Advanced Attributes dialog box, and click OK again to close the Properties dialog box. If you 
look in Windows Explorer, you’ll see that the files you encrypted are now shown in green rather than black.
Encrypting the Hard Drive Using BitLocker
You can use the BitLocker program (in the Enterprise edition of Windows 7) to encrypt the entire hard drive. Follow these 
steps:
	 1.	Click the Windows Start button and choose Control Panel.
	 2.	In the Control Panel window, click the System and Security option.
	 3.	In the System and Security window, click BitLocker Drive Encryption. You will see a list of all the hard drives in your 
system. If you have any USB drives plugged in, they will also be shown here.

565
Chapter 16: Network and Internet Privacy and Security
	 4.	Click the Turn On BitLocker link next to the drive you want to encrypt. BitLocker will start.
	 5.	When prompted, supply the password you want to use to decrypt the drive.
	 6.	The system will generate a recovery key that can be used if you lose or forget the password. Print this key and 
save it somewhere safe, or save it to a file on another drive or device.
	 7.	Click Next. The system is ready to encrypt the drive.
	 8.	Click Start Encrypting, sit back, and wait. The bigger the drive, the longer it will take to encrypt. When the process 
is complete, the list of drives in the Control Panel will show your encrypted drive as “On” rather than “Off.”
CAUTION
Don’t save the recovery key on the hard drive you have just encrypted. You won’t be able to read it if you lose 
the password!
Encrypting Internet Communications
In addition to encrypting your hard drive and the individual files on it, some websites enable you to encrypt your 
Internet communications. To determine whether an Internet connection is secure, check to see whether the 
URL starts with https rather than http or look for a padlock icon in the web browser’s address bar. (The padlock 
icon appears to the right of the URL in Internet Explorer and to the left in Firefox, as shown here.) Both indicate 
a secure connection between your computer and the website; data captured between these two points will be 
unreadable. (That said, see the Caution about the Heartbleed virus earlier in this chapter.)
Privacy and Security
Preventing Data Loss
Security is not just about preventing unauthorized access to your data. 
It’s also about protecting your data from damage or loss. In other words, 
it means ensuring that if anything should happen to your computer—for 
example, the computer is stolen, lost, broken, or destroyed in a fire or 
flood—you still have access to a copy of the data it contains.
To facilitate this level of security, you must be sure to store at least one 
copy of your data somewhere safe. One approach is to connect an exter-
nal hard drive to your computer and copy all your important files onto 
it. This is called “making a backup,” or “backing up.” After you have 
backed up the data, you must store the drive somewhere safe. You should 
back up your system on a regular basis. That way, you know you have 
copies if something goes wrong.

566
Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
Step by Step
Setting Up Windows Backup to Perform Automatic Backups
To set up Windows Backup to back up your files automatically on a regular basis, follow these steps:
	 1.	Click the Windows Start button and choose Control Panel.
	 2.	In the Control Panel window, click the System and Security option.
	 3.	In the System and Security window, click Backup and Restore.
	 4.	The first time you run Windows Backup, you must set it up. To begin, click the Set Up Backup link.
	 5.	Specify the drive on which you want to save your backup (usually an external drive for safekeeping). Then click 
Next.
	
	 If you prefer, you can save the backup to a network location rather than a hard drive. To do so, click Save on a 
Network. Then enter the network location’s file path in the Network Location field. (If you don’t know the path, click 
Browse, locate and select the folder on the network in which you want to save your backup, and click OK.) Finally, 
enter the appropriate username and password to access the network in the Username and Password fields and 
click OK.
	 6.	Specify what files you want to back up. Note that you can let Windows choose (recommended) or choose yourself. 
Then click Next.
	 7.	The Review Your Backup Settings screen summarizes your settings, including when and how often backups will 
occur. To change the backup schedule, click the Change Schedule link.
Windows comes with a built-in backup utility, Windows Backup, that 
you can use to back up your files and also restore them in the event of 
damage or loss.

567
Chapter 16: Network and Internet Privacy and Security
	 8.	The How Often Do You Want to Back Up screen appears. Make sure the Run Backup on a Schedule check box is 
selected.
	 9.	Click the How Often drop-down list and choose Daily, Weekly, or Monthly. If you chose Weekly or Monthly, also click 
the What Day drop-down list and choose the day on which backups should occur.
	10.	Click the What Time drop-down list and specify the hour on which backups should occur.
	11.	Click OK to close the How Often Do You Want to Back Up? screen. Then click Save Settings and Run Backup in the 
Review Your Backup Settings screen. Windows launches the backup operation; subsequent backups will occur on 
the schedule you specified.
Performing a Manual Backup with Windows Backup
You don’t have to wait for your system to back up automatically. You can also perform a manual backup. You might do so 
if you’re about to make a system change, or if your computer was turned off when the automatic backup was scheduled 
to occur. To run perform a manual backup, follow these steps:
	 1.	Click the Windows Start button and choose Control Panel.
	 2.	In the Control Panel window, click the System and Security option.
	 3.	In the System and Security window, click Backup and Restore. The Backup or Restore Your Files screen 
appears.
	 4.	Click Back Up Now to launch the backup operation.
Restoring Files with Windows Backup
If you’ve used Windows Backup to back up the files and folders on your computer, you can restore the backed up files 
and folders in the event of system failure or some other disaster. To restore the files, first connect the medium on which 
the backed up files are stored. For example, if you stored the backed up files and folders on an external hard drive, you 
must connect it to your PC. Then follow these steps:
	 1.	Click the Windows Start button and choose Control Panel.
	 2.	In the Control Panel window, click the System and Security option.
	 3.	In the System and Security window, click Backup and Restore. The Backup or Restore Your Files screen 
appears.
	 4.	Click Restore My Files. Windows launches the Restore Files wizard.
	 5.	To restore all folders and files in your system, click Browse for Folders. A Browse dialog box appears.
	 6.	Click the folder containing the backup of your hard drive and click Add Folder. The folder is added to the Restore 
Files wizard’s list of items to restore; click Next.
	
	 If you need to restore only certain files, click Browse for Files instead of Browse for Folders. Then locate and 
select the files you want to restore.
	 7.	Click the In the Original Location radio button to restore the folder to its original location on your hard drive.
	 8.	Click Restore. Windows restores the files, notifying you when the restore operation is complete. Click Finish.

Backing Up to “the Cloud”
In addition to backing up data to an external hard drive or network location, you can also back it up to “the 
cloud”—that is, to a data storage site on the Internet. When you back up your files to the Internet, you can access 
them from anywhere. Microsoft OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) is an example of one such site. After you set it up, it 
appears as a local folder on your computer. (Chapter 3, “Input, Output, and Storage,” provides more information 
about Microsoft OneDrive.) Other examples of data storage sites in the cloud are Google Drive and Dropbox. All 
these storage providers offer users a certain amount of free storage with the option to buy additional capacity as 
needed. You could even be extra cautious and back up to both a hard drive and to a storage site in the cloud. That 
way, if something happens to one of your backups, you still have another copy of the data.
Installing Operating System Updates
When you buy a computer, it usually comes with an operating system 
pre-installed so you can start work straightaway. The version of the oper-
ating system that is installed is typically the version that was available 
when the computer was manufactured. Operating systems are constantly 
being updated, however. For example, Microsoft is always looking for 
ways to improve its products. That means the version of the operating 
system installed on your computer might not be the most recent version 
available.
This would not necessarily be a problem, were it not for the fact that 
many of the improvements made to operating systems after their initial 
release pertain to fixing bugs and patching security holes—hence, 
the use of the word “patches” to describe these fixes. It’s critical that 
you install updates to your computer’s operating system (and to the 
programs that run on it) to ensure that all the most recent patches are 
applied.
Software manufacturers can distribute a patch as a single update to a 
program or as a group of updates to several programs. Periodically, 
Microsoft groups several patches together and produces a package 
called a service pack. A service pack contains all the patches released 
either since the product was launched or since the last service pack was 
released. To determine whether any service packs have been installed on 
your Windows computer, open the Control Panel and click the System 
and Security option. Then click System to see the current status of your 
operating system. (See Figure 16.12.)
service pack A collection of patches, released 
in a single package.

Figure 16.12  Windows 7 running with Service Pack 1.
To make it easier for you to keep your system up to date, Microsoft 
offers the Windows Update tool. To access it, open the Control Panel, 
click System and Security, and choose Windows Update. As shown in 
Figure 16.13, you can click on the links to choose from the following 
options:
◾	 Check for Updates: Select this option to perform an immediate 
check for new updates.
◾	 Change Settings: Choose this option to specify how and when 
updates are installed.
◾	 View Update History: To see when updates were installed, select 
this option.
◾	 Restore Hidden Updates: This option enables you to install 
updates that you have chosen not to install previously.
The simplest way to manage updates is to allow your system to install 
them automatically; you can select that option by choosing Change 
Settings in the navigation bar at the left and then adjusting the settings 
on the Choose How Windows Can Install Updates screen that appears. 
The default settings are for an automatic update at 3 a.m. every day. If 
your computer is not powered up at that time, Windows will perform 
the update the next time you turn it on. If you want, you can change the 
time of the update. If your system has not installed an available update, 
you will see a message in the notification area at the bottom right corner 
of the screen, indicating that updates are available.

Wiping Old Drives
In Chapter 5, “Introduction to Windows 7,” you learned how to delete 
files. You may not have realized, however, that when you delete files 
from a computer, you do not delete the data in those files. Instead, you 
delete the information about where to find the data on the hard drive. 
Many software programs can recover files that have been deleted. That’s 
good news if the files were deleted by mistake. But it’s bad news if some-
one in possession of your hard drive—for example, someone who obtains 
it after you have disposed of it—uses one of these programs to recover 
files you deleted on purpose.
To permanently remove files from your hard drive, you must use a 
software program that erases the hard drive permanently and securely. 
These programs work by writing a series of patterns over the entire 
disk so that all existing data is overwritten and cannot be recovered. 
Several good programs perform this task. Some are even available free 
of charge, such as Active@ KillDisk for Windows (see Figure 16.14) 
and Eraser.
If you want to dispose of a hard drive, even if only to give it to a friend, 
it’s important to remove all traces of personal information from the drive 
by running one of these programs on it beforehand. That way, you can 
be sure that the hard drive is blank, and there is no chance that anyone 
else could recover your data.
CAUTION
Before you erase your hard disk, copy all the data on it to a new hard drive unless you are sure you no longer 
want this data. Once you start the overwriting process, you can’t retrieve the data.

Summary
Network and Internet Security Concerns
Computer crime is becoming increasingly common. It is essential that you be aware of computer 
security and take the necessary steps to secure your data and online identity.
Computer criminals engage in many types of activities that can compromise your computer system, 
your data, and your online identity. One of the common threats is phishing. In this type of attack, 
nefarious users try to trick unsuspecting users into giving away personal information such as login 
details or credit card information. Another threat is spoofing. In this type of attack, the attacker’s 
computer assumes a false Internet address in order to gain access to a network. Attackers also 
use sniffing to capture copies of data packets as they travel across the network and decode their 
content.
Often, the goal of hackers or crackers is to obtain a user’s password. To do so, they often attempt 
password cracking—that is, they attempt to identify a user’s password. Password cracking can be 
accomplished in several ways, including guessing, using a keylogger to record the user’s key-
strokes, social engineering, sniffing, or using any one of a variety of password-cracking tools.
Many computer criminals employ malware—that is, malicious software—in their efforts to 
compromise a user’s computer system, data, and online identity. There are several types of mal-
ware, including viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, and ransomware. To protect yourself against 
malware, you must run a security program. Although these programs are often called “anti-virus 
programs,” they have evolved over the years into a broader security solution that can detect and 
protect against viruses, worms, Trojans, and sometimes more complex threats. A good anti-virus 
package provides a wide range of protective measures and may include firewall management and 
anti-spyware. Many good anti-virus products are in the marketplace, including Symantec, Sophos, 
Kaspersky, and McAfee.
Anti-virus programs are less effective against denial of service (DoS) attacks. In this type of 
attack, the attacker floods a website or service with thousands of requests for access—so many 
that the site or service cannot deal with them all. As a result, legitimate users are prevented from 
accessing the site or service. The computers that launch these attacks are called zombies. A zom-
bie is a computer that has been infected with a particular type of Trojan called a bot.
Users should also be wary of Wi-Fi networks. When Wi-Fi networks are not properly secured, it is 
easy to steal data on them with little chance of being caught. It’s not just un-secure networks that 
pose a risk, however. Some wireless networks appear to be genuine, but in fact attempt to inter-
cept your traffic. These types of Wi-Fi networks are called rogue Wi-Fi. Public places where many 
people are looking for Wi-Fi, such as coffee shops, restaurants, and airports, are common locations 
for rogue Wi-Fi connections.
Network and Internet Privacy Concerns
Using networks and the Internet can put your privacy at risk in a number of ways. For example, 
search engine sites can gather information about you based on the terms you search for and the 
questions you ask. In addition, websites for which you provide personal information, such as your 
name, address, email, and so forth, can store that information and perhaps use it for purposes 
other than those you intended. Finally, someone who ascertains the unique identity of your com-
puter can use this information to access your computer via a network and view, change, or delete 
your personal data.
To protect people’s privacy, most countries have data protection and privacy laws to control the 
access and distribution of this personal information. These laws regulate the companies that hold 
our personal information and ensure that all our information is properly protected.

573
Chapter 16: Network and Internet Privacy and Security
Of course, just because there are laws designed to protect your privacy online does not mean that 
you should not take additional steps to keep yourself safe. As a first step, you should determine 
what personal information is available online by conducting a search for your name. You should 
also take care when using social media to avoid sharing information about yourself that would be 
better kept private. Another strategy is to delete cookies from your computer. That way, no one 
can use your cookies in a malicious way.
Strategies for Improving Security
You can take many steps to improve security. One step is to restrict access to your computer and 
data by using strong passwords, applying permissions, and enabling firewalls. You can also use 
encryption to scramble the data on your hard drive, thereby preventing others from being able to 
read it.
Security is not just about preventing unauthorized access to your data, however. It’s also about 
protecting your data from damage or loss by storing copies of your data somewhere safe. This 
process is called “making a backup,” or “backing up.” You should back up your system on a regu-
lar basis. To do so, you can use the Windows built-in backup utility, called Windows Backup. If 
you used Windows Backup to back up the files and folders on your computer, you can restore the 
backed up files and folders in the event of system failure or some other disaster.
It’s important that you run the most up-to-date version of your operating system. That way, as 
manufacturers fix bugs and patch security holes, you ensure that all the most recent patches are 
applied. To make it easier for you to keep your system up to date, Microsoft offers the Windows 
Update tool, which performs automatic updates to the operating system. Using this tool, you can 
check for new updates, change the automatic update settings, view your update history, and more.
If you want to dispose of data you have on a hard drive, even if only to give your computer to a 
friend, you must remove all traces of personal information from the drive. To do so, simply run 
a special software program that is designed to permanently erase the contents of your hard drive. 
These programs work by writing a series of patterns over the entire disk so that all existing data is 
overwritten and cannot be recovered.

Backing Up Your Data
Have a look at the files on your computer and make a list of those that contain personal data. 
Compare the different methods and devices you could use to make a copy of this data and identify 
the best way of making a backup copy. If you have the means, make a backup copy and identify a 
safe place to keep it.
Keeping Your System Up to Date
Explore your computer to check how up-to-date it is. Does it have a service pack installed? Run 
the Windows Update process to see if there are any uninstalled updates. Is there a reason why you 
have not installed them?
Protecting Yourself against Malware
Identify what type of anti-virus solution you have in place. Every package has its own control 
panel for administration. Open this panel and see how often the software checks the Internet for 
updates. Carry out a manual scan of your computer.
What Are the Latest Threats?
Visit the website of one of the anti-virus software providers and look at what the latest threats are 
and how recent they are. Identify how many pieces of malware have been discovered in the last

Learning objectives
◽	 Be aware of the legal issues that arise from using computers and the 
Internet
◽	 Understand how to use the Internet in an ethical manner
◽	 Understand the potential impact on health when using a computer
◽	 Be aware of what to consider when disposing of a computer
This chapter moves beyond the technical aspects of working with computers and 
software to examine the legal and ethical issues related to computer use. These 
issues range from the legal ownership of online content to the ethical options for 
acquiring and using software, as well as what is appropriate (and inappropriate) 
online activity. This chapter also covers various health risks posed by computer use 
and the appropriate methods for disposing of computer hardware.
Legal Issues in Computing
Nearly everything we do in life is governed by laws of one sort or another. Not 
surprisingly, these laws extend to cover our use of computers and the Internet. 
Legal issues in computing are complex, however. Whereas we are usually governed 
by the laws of the country in which we reside, the Internet is global, and differ-
ent countries have different laws. That means you might access Internet content 
in your web browser that is regulated by local law, but the content itself is hosted 
on a server in another jurisdiction, and as such is governed by another set of rules. 
What is legal in one country is not necessarily legal in another, so you could end

up unwittingly being guilty of an offense. For example, in some coun-
tries, online gambling is legal, and citizens may both participate in online 
gambling and host their own gambling sites. In other countries not only 
is it illegal to host an online gambling site, but it is also illegal for citizens 
of that country to use an online gambling site hosted in a country where 
it is legal.
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property (IP), also called intellectual property rights (IPR), 
is a legal term that grants people the exclusive rights to the ownership of 
content that they have created. “Created” is the important word here. This 
can apply to tangible items, such a book, as well as to ideas that have been 
documented, such as patents, artistic works, photographs, and music.
IP has evolved over many years and can now be applied to certain aspects of 
computing and the Internet. For example, suppose you design a web page 
or produce some written material for a website. Depending on the nature 
of the material (and on any agreements you have in place with others), you 
may have the exclusive rights to use it because you created it. In effect, it 
belongs to you. Intellectual property provides protection for the owner of 
the material.
Copyright Laws
Copyright is a subset of intellectual property but differs in interpretation 
and use. Copyright is a legal protection that usually gives the creator of a 
work—be it written or artistic—exclusive rights to its use and distribution 
for a limited time period. For example, when an author writes a book, he 
might choose to obtain the copyright for that book. Then, the author (and 
his descendants) will be entitled to royalties from the sale of the book until 
the copyright expires. In many countries, a work’s copyright lasts for the 
duration of the creator’s lifetime plus an additional 50 years after his death. 
(Note that in some cases, a book’s publisher might hold the copyright on 
the work, depending on the agreement struck by the author. Note, too, 
that copyright can be limited to geographical boundaries unless there is 
some form of international agreement between the parties.)
There is no symbol to identify IP, but when something is copyrighted, you 
will usually see the © symbol along with the copyright owner’s name and 
sometimes a year. For example, if you look inside the front cover of this 
book, you will see the following copyright: ©2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 
Copyright has become difficult to enforce with the advent of digital media 
and the Internet, which make it easy to download and redistribute material. 
Unless some form of digital rights management (DRM) is in use, it is impos-
sible to enforce copyright law over so many jurisdictions. (You’ll learn more 
about DRM in the next section.)
Digital Rights Management
Digital rights management (DRM) involves the use of technology to 
control access to copyrighted material. It is a practical attempt to address the 
growing problem of the unauthorized copying and distribution of material. 
The practice of distributing digital content over the Internet via file-sharing 
networks has made the enforcement of traditional copyright laws difficult.
intellectual property (IP) The exclusive rights 
to the ownership of something that has been cre-
ated or produced.
copyright The granting of exclusive rights to the 
creator of a work for a limited period of time.

Chapter 17: Legal, Ethical, Health, and Environmental Issues in Computing
Imagine you want to download a copyrighted music track. Normally, you 
would do so by purchasing it. In essence, when you purchase the track, 
you pay for the right to access it, with part of the purchase price being 
paid to the author or artist in the form of royalties. If you were to instead 
download the track illegally from a free peer-to-peer sharing site, you 
would defraud the author or artist of her royalties.
DRM helps to prevent such illegal downloads. DRM allows for access 
verification to protected material. To access DRM-protected material, 
the user needs a username and password, which are stored in a database. 
When the user attempts to access the material, his credentials are checked 
against the database, and the user is granted or denied access accordingly. 
Once access is granted, the user can access the content, but there may be 
restrictions on what actions he can carry out.
In other cases, DRM helps to prevent already downloaded files from 
being widely shared with others. For example, iTunes downloads can be 
burned to an audio CD a limited number of times, can be placed only 
on portable devices that are registered to the signed-in user, and will not 
play if manually copied to another computer.
Some software vendors use DRM to allow document authors to protect 
content created with the software. Access to a document may be restricted 
by requiring anyone who opens the file to log into a DRM server online. 
Figure 17.1 shows an example of such a login screen.
Figure 17.1  Using digital rights management.
Opponents of DRM
DRM is not without controversy. Indeed, many organizations and computer scientists are opposed to the practice. 
Some argue that the use of DRM restricts users’ access from using content they have rightfully purchased as they 
see fit. For example, DRM prevents legitimate users from making personal copies of materials, lending copies to 
friends, and so on. In addition, DRM may on occasion prevent legitimate users from accessing their content. Finally, 
many argue that the use of DRM is pointless, as more often than not, users are able to crack the codes used to 
secure content.

Software Licensing
When you install an operating system or software program, one of the 
first stages of the process is to agree to its terms and conditions. These 
terms and conditions are presented in a legal document called an End 
User License Agreement (EULA), the end user being you. The EULA 
defines what you as a user can and cannot do with the product you are 
about to install.
These agreements, when displayed, often take up more than one screen. 
That means you’ll often need to use a scroll bar to read the entire agree-
ment. When you get to the bottom of the screen, you will typically see a 
check box or option button, as shown in Figure 17.2, which you select to 
accept the agreement. You will not be able to proceed to the next stage of 
the install until you accept the agreement. If you choose not to accept the 
terms and conditions, you won’t be permitted to install the software. It 
may take a few minutes to read through the terms and conditions, but it’s 
a good idea to do so, so you will know what you can and cannot legally 
do with the software.
Figure 17.2  A typical end user license agreement.
What are you agreeing to? This depends on the nature of the product 
and the terms the vendor defines. Here are a few points to keep in mind:
◾	 Usually you are “granted the rights to use” a particular software 
program, not necessarily “granted ownership” of the software in 
question.
◾	 Sometimes when you purchase software, you may be required to 
pay an annual fee to use it. In this case, your license would grant 
you access to the product only until the renewal date. For example, 
Adobe CC and Office 365 are both subscription-based.
◾	 You normally have explicit use of one copy of the software. That 
means you can download and run it, but you cannot make copies 
and install it on another computer, nor can you make copies and 
distribute them to your friends.
End User License Agreement (EULA) A 
legal document that grants you permission to use 
a piece of software.

581
Chapter 17: Legal, Ethical, Health, and Environmental Issues in Computing
NOTE
For most vendors, licensing is a way of ensuring that they collect revenue for the products they offer. Vendors 
also use licensing to ensure that if people use the software to break any laws, it is the user who is in trouble, 
not the vendor.
Types of Software and Licensing
Software vendors offer different types of software. Some software vendors 
offer proprietary software—that is, software you can use but do not own, 
and whose source code is kept private. Other vendors offer open-source 
software—that is, software that is free to use, and whose source code is 
accessible and can be altered by any user with the appropriate program-
ming skills. For more information about each of these types of software 
and their legal ramifications, read on.
Proprietary Software
Proprietary software is software you can use but do not own. The 
vendor retains ownership; you simply have the right to use one or more 
copies of the software after purchasing it and agreeing to the EULA. The 
source code used in this type of software is kept private. That is, users are 
not permitted to access and/or change the code.
Products such as Microsoft Office are licensed in this way. For example, 
if you purchase a copy of Microsoft Office Home and Student, you are 
allowed to run one licensed copy of the software on a single computer for 
the life of the PC. It is possible to transfer the license to another computer, 
but there are restrictions. As an alternative, you could purchase a copy of 
Microsoft Office Family Pack. This consists of a single instance of the soft-
ware, but in this case, you are allowed to run it on as many as three different 
computers. There are transfer restrictions, and you are not allowed to use 
the software for commercial or business use. That requires a different license.
proprietary software Software to which the 
vendor retains ownership rights. Users merely have 
usage rights.
Product Activation
During installation, some products require you not only to agree to the terms and conditions, but also to enter 
a license code or key to activate the product. This key can be sent by email as part of the registration process. 
Alternatively, it could be provided on a printed card as part of a physical software package.
Many products, particularly the more expensive ones like Microsoft Office, also require online activation. This calls 
for an active Internet connection. Online activation adds the license key to a database of active licenses, maintained 
by the software vendor. This prevents someone from using the same code again to license the software more than 
once, thus breaking the terms of the single user license. This figure shows the result of an online activation.
Privacy and Security

582
Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
Even with a basic computer—one that you use at home or at college—
you must consider how you manage the licensing. For example, to use a 
computer with Microsoft Office, you would need to have the following:
◾	 A valid license to use the operating system
◾	 A valid license to use Microsoft Office
◾	 Valid license agreements for all other software products you have 
installed on the computer
Fortunately, the process of agreeing to licenses is usually automatic, so it 
is not something you have to spend too much time on.
Put It to Work
Trial Software
Some vendors enable users to download a free trial version of a proprietary software program. When you do, you 
still have to agree to the terms and conditions, and you only get to use the software for a short period of time—
typically from 7 to 30 days. You may also find that the trial version is a scaled-down version of the full program, 
without all the features. In other words, certain aspects of the full-version software don’t function. The idea behind 
the trial software is for you to evaluate the software and see if it is the right product for you. At the end of the trial 
period, if you want to continue using the software, you will be asked to purchase a license. If so, you will be sent a 
code to activate the product.
Open-Source Software
There is a growing movement toward producing open-source software—
that is, software that is not only free to use, but also whose source code is 
accessible to users to modify and redistribute. You may be wondering, why 
is it free? What’s in it for the software developers? The answer is simple: 
The open-source movement is all about promoting freedoms and remov-
ing licensing restrictions. The theory is that by allowing the free distri-
bution of software that can be enhanced by others, the computer world 
benefits from having consistently improved products—and from that, we 
all benefit.
Although open-source software is about removing licensing restrictions, 
many types of open-source software do carry a license, called the General 
Public License (GPL). The GPL—developed by an organization called 
the Free Software Foundation, that exists to support the creation and distri-
bution of free software—is a simply worded license that enables individuals 
and companies to legally copy and modify software. This gives users much 
greater freedom with the product, allowing them to make as many copies as 
they like, installing it on all their computers, distributing it to friends, and, 
of course, making changes to the source code if they so desire.
Software Piracy
Software piracy is the unauthorized copying of software programs. 
There are various types of software piracy:
◾	 Counterfeit software. Counterfeit software is a copy of a legitimate 
product that is made and marketed as an original. With counter-
feit software, the media and packaging may look genuine, but only 
open-source software Free access to a soft-
ware program and the source code that produced 
the program.
General Public License (GPL) A license used 
for many types of open-source software, allowing 
the software to be legally copied and modified.
software piracy The unauthorized copying and 
distribution of software.

583
Chapter 17: Legal, Ethical, Health, and Environmental Issues in Computing
because the software has been copied and packaged to look like the 
original. It is sometimes difficult to tell the difference between the 
genuine article and a fake. Counterfeit software is even easier to sell 
over the Internet—particularly software that is downloadable rather 
than distributed on a physical disc. This type of software is often 
sold on sites that appear to be authorized, but if you look closely, 
you can usually spot clues that the site is not legitimate, such as a 
slightly different spelling in the URL, grammar or usage errors that 
indicate a non-native speaker may have created the page, or blurry 
or incorrect logos.
◾	 Corporate piracy. Often, a company or organization will pur-
chase software in a legitimate way, but install the software on more 
machines than it is supposed to. For example, a company might 
buy software with 50 licenses but install it on 100 computers. This 
practice, which can save corporations many thousands or even mil-
lions of dollars, is called “corporate piracy.” It may seem benign, 
but it is in fact a form of theft.
◾	 Unbundling packages. When you purchase a computer or note-
book, it frequently comes as an original equipment manufacturer 
(OEM) bundle. For example, the operating system comes pre-
loaded on the computer and is licensed to that particular computer. 
If the bundle comes with a backup copy of the operating system on 
DVD and the owner sells that copy to someone else, this breaks the 
terms of the license and is a form of piracy.
◾	 Internet piracy. There are many Internet sites where copyrighted 
software can be illegally downloaded free or at low cost. These 
sites even give users guidance on where to obtain the license key 
information necessary to use the program, or produce fake keys 
themselves. This is Internet piracy. With so many sites and so much 
software available, Internet piracy is virtually unstoppable. Much 
of the illegal software is published in countries where the necessary 
laws are not strongly enforced. Sites that offer these illegal activities 
sometimes contain malware that can infect your computer when 
you download from them.
CAUTION
Next time you accept an offer of some software from a friend, ask yourself these questions:
	 1.	 Has it come from a genuine source?
	 2.	 Is it okay to share this software with others?
	 3.	 Is it licensed for more than one computer?
You could quite easily break the law by accepting the software and using it. Remember, though, that ignorance 
is not a legal defense.

Ethical Issues in Computing
With computing comes several ethical issues—particularly with regard to 
the Internet. These range from plagiarism to censorship, libel, slander, 
and beyond.
Plagiarism
Plagiarism is the practice of copying someone else’s work and pretending 
that it is your own. Thanks to the Internet, it is all too easy to download a 
document from an obscure website and submit or republish it as yours.
Plagiarism comes in several forms:
◾	 Copying work produced by someone else word for word and pre-
senting it as your own
◾	 Inserting portions of someone else’s work into your own and 
claiming full credit
◾	 Changing a few words and phrases of a piece of work so it looks 
different but is based on someone else’s work
◾	 Taking material from multiple sources and putting it all together as 
your own work
Plagiarism has become a big problem in colleges and universities. Often, 
when students receive assignments, they simply research on the Internet, 
copy large blocks of text from various sources, stitch them together into 
a single document, and pass the result off as their own work. Even worse, 
some students patronize any one of several Internet-based companies 
that write assignments for them.
Using Citations
It is not always wrong to use someone else’s work. In many cases, you 
can quote or paraphrase (discussed next) someone else’s work in your 
own piece—provided you include a reference to the source (in other 
words, to the author and name of the work). This is called a citation. 
Including a citation to give credit to the original author of a piece of 
work is the only way to avoid plagiarism.
Citations generally appear in footnote form. A footnote contains infor-
mation about the source of the text being quoted, appearing at the bot-
tom of the page that contains the text in question. The quote is marked 
with a small number, which is then repeated next to the footnote. This 
enables the reader to match the footnote with the quote. Another way 
to cite sources is with a bibliography, which is a list of the sources you 
reference.
plagiarism The act of copying someone else’s 
work and pretending that it is your own.
citation A reference to a source—that is, to the 
author and name of a published or unpublished 
work—following a quotation from said source.
footnote Information about the source of 
a quote, which is marked with a number and 
appears at the bottom of the page.
bibliography A list of the sources referenced in a 
document, commonly used in academic writing.
NOTE
As an alternative to footnotes, there are endnotes. These appear at the end of a chapter or document rather 
than at the bottom of a page. They contain the same content as footnotes, however.

585
Chapter 17: Legal, Ethical, Health, and Environmental Issues in Computing
TIP
You can also use footnotes to supply other information about the text. For example, you might use a footnote 
to supply the full title of a book to which the text refers, as shown in Figure 17.3, or to fill in additional details 
about the topic at hand.
Step by Step
Inserting a Footnote in a Word Document
To insert a footnote in a Microsoft Word document, follow these steps:
	 1.	Click at the end of the quoted or paraphrased material 
in your document. Then click on the References tab. 
Finally, click the Insert Footnote button. This adds a 
superscript numeral to the right of the quoted material 
and moves the cursor to the bottom of the page, where 
the number is repeated.
	 2.	Type the citation, including the author’s name and the 
name of the work being quoted. (Note that the for-
mat of the citation may vary. If you are working on an 
assignment, ask your professor or supervisor for details.)
	 3.	To insert additional footnotes, repeat Steps 1 and 2. As you do, the footnote number will increment.
Figure 17.3  Using footnotes for other purposes.
Paraphrasing
In addition to quoting an author directly, you can paraphrase what he or 
she writes. When you paraphrase, you use different words to convey the 
same idea. Even so, you still must include a citation to acknowledge that 
the original idea came from someone else.
paraphrase To use different words to convey the 
same idea.
Combating Plagiarism
Recent years have seen the development of a range of anti-plagiarism software products, such as turnitin (www.
turnitin.com). These programs compare a submitted document against a large database of quotes and texts. 
Mathematical processes check not only for actual word-for-word plagiarism, but also for paraphrased text where it 
can identify the original source. The results then highlight any suspect or copied areas in text and state where cita-
tions should be applied.
New Technologies

Using software like this, it takes only a few seconds to examine a docu-
ment. Some educational institutions use this type of software as standard 
practice for all work handed in by students. Students can also use this 
type of software before turning in an assignment to ensure they have not 
inadvertently plagiarized.
Censorship and Filtering
Censorship is the act of preventing something from being printed or heard. 
Historically, censorship has been used to prevent important information 
from reaching the population at large by controlling what can be printed or 
broadcast. Censorship is sometimes implemented by governments so they 
can control the flow of information for political or military reasons. For 
example, writing that is deemed to be obscene or advocates that citizens 
break the country’s existing laws might be censored. Individuals or com-
panies can also apply forms of censorship by not allowing certain types of 
information to be published. For example, if you post a negative review of a 
product on the manufacturer’s website, your view may be deleted; this is an 
example of corporate censorship.
Filtering is a form of censorship performed by software. Filtering means 
to prevent something from getting through. For example, when you filter 
water, you remove all the impurities, making it safe to drink. Similarly, 
when you filter the Internet, you exclude certain categories of content 
from general access. For example, a parent might install web filtering soft-
ware on a child’s computer to prevent the child from accessing websites 
with graphic violent content, or a coffee shop might use filtering to pre-
vent its patrons from accessing adult-themed sites when using the store’s 
Internet connection. Companies also may filter their employees’ web usage 
at work, such as blocking social networking sites like Facebook to improve 
productivity.
Web filtering is accomplished by using a proxy server—that is, a server 
that sits between the user’s web browser and the Internet and manages 
all requests for content. Proxy servers work as follows:
	
1.	The user types a URL or clicks a link in her web browser in an 
attempt to visit a web page.
	
2.	The web browser sends a request for the page to the proxy server.
	
3.	The proxy server fetches the requested page on the Internet and 
passes it back to the user’s web browser, or lets the user know that 
the page cannot be displayed, depending on the proxy server’s 
filtering settings.
When users attempt to access a filtered site, a message is displayed in their 
browser, notifying them that the request is denied. Figure 17.4 shows a 
list of blocked site categories on a proxy server.

not allowing certain communications to be made

Figure 17.4  A list of blocked categories on a proxy server.
You can apply filtering using any or all of the following criteria:
◾	 Block access to certain websites based on their URLs
◾	 Block access to certain websites based on the actual content of the 
web pages
◾	 Prevent certain users from accessing certain websites
◾	 Restrict access based on time of day
◾	 Restrict access based on categories of content
Flaming
Most likely, when you use chat rooms or social networks or comment 
on websites, you interact quite happily with other users. Occasionally, 
however, you may find that some users become quite hostile. This hap-
pens frequently on sites like YouTube, which gives users the option to 
post comments, and on social networking sites like Facebook. Some of 
the comments become negative and personal, complete with insults and 
swear words. This is called flaming. When the negativity escalates as 
more comments are posted, it is known as a flame war.
Libel and Slander
Libel and slander are similar in that both are statements that can cause 
damage to someone’s reputation.
Libel is the act of putting a false and defamatory statement in writing. 
Any false statement that could damage the reputation of an individual 
or organization could be considered to be libel. Because it is written, it 
can have a lasting effect on the individual or company being libeled. For 
example, a libelous comment published on Twitter and then retweeted 
to others could spread quickly. It would be difficult to control the spread 
and to undo the damage caused. In most countries, libel is a civil offense. 
That means the person or organization being libeled would have to take 
legal action to obtain any form of compensation or redress. For libel to 
be upheld, it must be proved that the statement is untrue.
flaming Where Internet users interact in a hostile 
way with each other.
libel Putting in writing a defamatory statement 
that could damage a person’s or organization’s 
reputation.

588
Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
Slander is the verbal version of libel. Slander might consist of negative 
comments about an individual or group that are made as part of a phone 
or face-to-face conversation; in the digital world, it may include slander-
ous comments made on an online-published video or in a group video 
conference. The effect is just as damaging to the reputation of the target 
individual.
Spamming
Spam—that is, unsolicited or “junk” email, typically containing offers 
(some legitimate, some not) for electronic goods, drugs, software, and 
so on—is a major problem on the Internet. These emails are sent in bulk, 
bombarding thousands if not millions of users at a time. There are vary-
ing estimates of how much email is spam, but most put the number at 
80% or more. Although most email programs include a junk email filter, 
many of these emails still slip through to fill users’ inboxes, as shown in 
Figure 17.5. As a result, users waste valuable time reading and deleting 
unwanted messages.
Figure 17.5  Examples of spam.
Typically, spammers use mailing lists to send these unwanted messages. 
A mailing list is simply a list of email addresses. Sending an email to a 
mailing list is no more difficult than sending it to a single recipient. You 
don’t have to type all the individual email addresses in; you just type the 
name of the mailing list. Often, spammers purchase these mailing lists 
from companies that sell them. Additionally, software programs, called 
mail harvesters, also collect email addresses over the Internet, which 
spammers then compile into mailing lists.
Not all email received from a business is spam. Businesses with whom 
you have a previous relationship, such as a store where you have ordered 
before, might send you promotional emails because you have given 
them your email address. You can unsubscribe from such emails with the 
Unsubscribe link provided in the email. Beware, however, of using the 
Unsubscribe link in a generic mass email that you get from a company 
that you have no relationship with. Sometimes unscrupulous spammers 
use the Unsubscribe link to confirm that their message has reached an 
active email address, and trying to unsubscribe will only get you added 
to more spammers’ lists.
slander Making a defamatory verbal statement 
that could damage a person’s or organization’s

Chapter 17: Legal, Ethical, Health, and Environmental Issues in Computing
Is spamming legal? It depends on what country you are in. In the United 
States, spam is legal, provided the message conforms to certain formats. 
What is most definitely not legal is when spam encourages recipients to 
visit fake websites and share personal information. That’s when spam 
becomes phishing.

Health Issues in Computing
Using computers brings with it a host of health issues, from eyestrain to 
back and limb problems. The stress and strain placed on a human body 
while using a computer can cause discomfort and pain and can lead to 
long-term medical conditions if not addressed. To confront these prob-
lems, users can pay special attention to their work environment, using 
good posture, ergonomic furniture, and appropriate lighting.
Combating Eyestrain
When you use your computer, your eyes focus at a fixed distance on a 
small area (your screen) for a considerable period of time. They were not 
designed to do this, however. As a result, many computer users end up 
with eyestrain, which can lead to blurring or headaches.
Here are a few tips for combating eyestrain:
◾	 Have regular eye examinations. If you have corrective eyewear, use 
it while working at the computer.
◾	 Situate your computer monitor such that it is 20 to 40 inches 
(50 to 100 centimeters) from your face, with your eyes just 
above the center of the screen. If necessary, adjust the angle of 
the screen. (Adjusting the height and angle of your monitor will 
also help to protect your neck and shoulders.)
◾	 Use incandescent rather than fluorescent lighting in your work 
area, because fluorescent lighting tends to flicker more. If you can-
not avoid fluorescent lighting, avoid working directly underneath 
the light fixture if possible.
◾	 Position your monitor so that bright light does not shine directly 
on it, to reduce glare.
◾	 Use a flat-screen LCD monitor instead of the older CRT type. If 
you cannot avoid using a CRT, set its refresh rate to at least 100 Hz 
in the display settings in your operating system.
◾	 Take frequent breaks. Avoid sitting in front of your monitor for 
more than an hour at a time.

590
Part IV: Connectivity and Communication
◾	 When you take a break, exercise your eyes. That is, look at items at 
different distances so your eyes get used to focusing normally again. 
Another way to exercise your eyes is to follow the 20-20-20 rule. 
That is, every 20 minutes, look away from the screen at something 
20 feet away for 20 seconds. This prevents the eye muscles from 
being in the same position for too long.
In addition, to prevent eyestrain, opt for as large a screen as possible  
(19 inches, or 48 centimeters, is a good bet), and decrease the screen 
resolution so that icons and text appear larger. That way, you won’t have 
to strain to see them. A lower resolution may make the display on an LCD 
monitor appear fuzzy, so you may have to balance between resolution and 
sharpness. However, in Windows 7 and higher, you can increase the size 
of icons and text without decreasing the display resolution. You can also 
adjust the brightness and contrast of your display to reduce eyestrain.
Step by Step
Changing Your Screen Resolution
To change your screen’s resolution, follow these steps:
	 1.	Right-click the desktop in Windows and choose Screen Resolution.
	 2.	Click the Resolution drop-down list. Then, drag the slider that appears to adjust the resolution.
	 3.	To see how the selected resolution looks, click the Apply button.
	 4.	If you like the change, click the Keep Changes button in the dialog box that appears. Otherwise, click Revert, and 
repeat Steps 3 and 4 as needed.
	 5.	When you are satisfied with the resolution, click the OK button to close the Screen Resolution screen.
Changing the Size of Icons and Text
To change the size of icons and text without changing your screen’s resolution, do the following:
	 1.	Right-click the desktop and choose Screen Resolution.
	 2.	Click the Make text and other items larger or smaller hyperlink.

591
Chapter 17: Legal, Ethical, Health, and Environmental Issues in Computing
	 3.	Click one of the available option buttons to change the size of text and other items. (Here, Smaller is chosen.) 
Then click the Apply button. You’ll be prompted to log off your computer and log back on to implement the change.
Adjusting the Screen Brightness
To adjust the screen’s brightness, follow these steps:
	 1.	Click the Start button and choose Control Panel to open the Control Panel window.
	 2.	In the Control Panel window, click the Hardware and Sound heading.
	 3.	Click the Power Options heading.
	 4.	Drag the Screen Brightness slider, located at the bottom of the window, to adjust the brightness.

Easing Your Back and Upper Limbs
Everything we do depends on our back. If our back is injured or out of 
alignment, it affects our ability to perform even the most mundane tasks. 
And yet, the back is arguably the most abused part of the body. This is 
because we fail to adopt the correct position when we perform certain 
activities, such as lifting heavy items. Even sitting down must be done 
correctly to ensure back health.
Unfortunately, too many computer users suffer from back problems because 
they fail to care for their back while they work. Computer users are also sub-
ject to sore fingers, aching shoulders, tired arms, and injured elbows. Often, 
permanent damage is done. For help preventing this, read on.
Using Good Posture
Posture refers to how we sit or stand. When using your computer (or 
doing anything else), it’s critical that you use good posture. Otherwise, 
you put too much strain on your body.
A good working posture is one in which the body’s position can be 
maintained with minimal physical effort. Your body should be relaxed. 
This allows you to maintain your position for longer, without putting 
strain on the body. Here are some hallmarks of good posture:
◾	 The lower back is supported by the shape of the chair.
◾	 The head is up and level.
◾	 The upper arms are relaxed.
◾	 The forearms are at a right angle with the upper arms.
◾	 The wrists are in a straight line with the hands and forearms.
◾	 The knees are level with the hips and the thighs are horizontal.
◾	 The feet are flat on the floor (or resting on a platform or footrest).
For best results, obtain an adjustable chair. Then use it to adjust your 
position while seated—leaning slightly backward for a while, and then 
slightly forward. Moving around in this way will help reduce strain on 
your body. (Regardless of how good your posture is, it is not wise to sit 
in the same position for too long!) An adjustable table or monitor stand 
can also help, enabling you to position the monitor correctly, as well as 
promote the correct placement for your forearms and wrists.
posture How a person sits or stands. When 
someone has good posture, the body is straight 
and the spine is correctly aligned.
TIP
To prevent neck strain, position your monitor directly in front of you on the desk, not at an angle off to 
one side.
Compare Figure 17.6 with Figure 17.7. The person in Figure 17.6 is 
leaning forward, with his feet dangling in an unnatural position. This 
puts strain on the rest of his body. In contrast, the person in Figure 17.7 
is more upright, and his feet are resting on the floor. His spine is in cor-
rect alignment.

Figure 17.6  Poor posture.
TIP
Even if you use perfect posture, you should take frequent breaks to maintain back health. Get up and stretch 
every 1-2 hours, at a minimum. Taking frequent breaks will also help you minimize stress and fatigue.
Positioning Your Desk and Chair
Desk and chair height can make a big difference in your body’s comfort. 
For best results, think parallel lines. Adjust the desk and chair height so 
that when you sit up straight at the desk, your thighs are parallel to the 
floor and both feet are flat on the floor. Adjust the keyboard and mouse 
heights so that your forearms are parallel to the floor when you are using 
them. You may need to install a keyboard tray below the desk’s main 
surface to achieve this.
Ergonomic Input Devices
Even with the proper vertical positioning of your keyboard and mouse, 
you may still experience some wrist strain when you use them for a long 
time. Repetitive stress injuries such as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome can make 
the tendons in your hands and wrists swollen and painful and cause burn-
ing or tingling.
One way to further protect your hands and wrists is to use ergonomically 
designed input devices. These special keyboards, mice, and trackballs are 
designed to reduce the strain placed on your body when you use them. 
For example, the keyboard shown in Figure 17.8 has a split design, so 
that your hands extend straight from your wrists when typing, rather 
than curving inward. This keyboard also has a built-in wrist rest in front. 
Figure 17.9 shows an ergonomically designed mouse; notice how the 
hand and thumb fit naturally on it at rest.

Environmental Issues in 
Computer Disposal
Computers are made of more than just their metal or plastic case. They 
contain components such as a motherboard, hard drive, display, and 
peripherals. These components contain all sorts of different materials, 
some of which may be toxic to the environment.
To avoid damaging the environment, it’s imperative that you dispose 
of your computer properly when you no longer want it. Dumping a 
computer in a landfill could cause heavy metals and poisons such as 
arsenic from the components to enter the area’s water supply, putting the 
population at risk. Similarly, incinerating a computer could release ele-
ments such as mercury and cadmium into the atmosphere, which could 
be harmful to those nearby.
Many countries now have regulations that govern the disposal process. 
In some cases, these regulations require computer retailers and manufac-
turers to contribute toward having the computer recycled. This makes 
the disposal process much safer and easier.
Rather than disposing of an old computer, consider harvesting the com-
ponents and using them elsewhere. Here are a few ideas:
◾	 Hard drive: Consider reusing the hard drive in another computer, 
as an additional drive for yourself or someone else. Or, keep it as a 
spare. If you opt to give the drive away, be sure to wipe your data 
from it using a program such as Active@ KillDisk (discussed in 
Chapter 16, “Network and Internet Privacy and Security”).

595
Chapter 17: Legal, Ethical, Health, and Environmental Issues in Computing
◾	 Memory: If the RAM is still usable and of a suitable capacity and 
speed, you could use it in another computer.
◾	 Keyboard and mouse: These are pretty universal and could be 
used with any computer. It’s always worth keeping old keyboards 
and mice as spares!
◾	 Display: If the monitor is of the CRT variety, it is probably at the 
end of its life and should be disposed of. If it’s a more modern, flat-
screen monitor, you may be able to use it with another computer. 
Alternatively, you could use it as a second monitor on your primary 
computer, running dual displays.
◾	 Removable components: A desktop computer may contain 
removable components such as a display adapter, sound card, 
or network interface card that could be saved for use in another 
computer.
◾	 Notebooks: There is not much you can remove and reuse from 
a notebook computer other than the hard drive and possibly the 
RAM, so this is likely to be disposed of intact.
Alternative Uses for an Older Computer
Before you dispose of your old computer, consider whether there is an alternative, environmentally friendly way of 
dealing with it—especially if the computer still has some life left in it. Here are a few ideas:
◾	 Sell it: If there’s nothing wrong with the computer, why not see if you can sell it—for example, on eBay or some 
other market place? (If you go this route, again, be sure you wipe the hard drive clean. See Chapter 16 for details.)
◾	 Give it away: It may be that some deserving person or organization could make good use of your old com-
puter. Why not donate it?
◾	 Assign it a new role: Even if your old computer is a bit slow running newer versions of Windows, it’s probably 
fast enough to run an alternative operating system, such as Linux. Try installing such an operating system on 
your old computer if you want an extra computer to play with!
◾	 Keep it as a spare: It’s not a bad idea to keep the old computer as a spare, just in case you have a problem 
with your new one. That way, if your main computer needs repairs, you’ll still have a computer to use in the 
interim.

Summary
Legal Issues in Computing
Intellectual property (IP) is a legal term that grants people the exclusive rights to the ownership 
of content that they have created, such as books, artistic works, photographs, music, software, and 
patents. Copyright is a legal protection that usually gives the creator of a work exclusive rights for 
a specified time period.
Digital rights management (DRM) involves the use of technology to control access to copy-
righted material in an attempt to prevent the unauthorized copying and distribution of material. 
When you install an operating system or software program, you must agree to legal document 
called an End User License Agreement (EULA). The EULA defines what a user can and cannot 
do with a product.
Open-source software is software that is not only free to use, but whose source code is accessible 
to users to modify and redistribute. Although open-source software is about removing licensing 
restrictions, many types of open-source software do carry a license, called the General Public 
License (GPL). The GPL enables individuals and companies to legally copy and modify software.
Software piracy is the unauthorized copying of software programs. There are various types 
of software piracy, including counterfeit software, corporate piracy, unbundling packages, and 
Internet piracy.
Ethical Issues in Computing
Plagiarism is the practice of copying someone else’s work and pretending that it is your own. To 
avoid plagiarism, use citations when referencing the work of others. One way to site a source is 
using a footnote. You can also reference your sources in a bibliography. You must cite not only 
the source of exact wording, but the source of paraphprased ideas.
Censorship is the act of preventing something from being printed or heard. Governments, com-
panies, or individuals can apply forms of censorship by not allowing certain types of information to 
be published or distributed.
Filtering means to prevent something from getting through. When you filter the Internet, you 
exclude certain categories of content from general access. A proxy server—that is, a server that 
sits between the user’s web browser and the Internet—is used to filter web content.
Sometimes, online communications become hostile, with personal attacks and insults. This is 
called flaming. Libel is the act of putting a false, defamatory statement in writing. Slander is the 
verbal version of libel. Slander might consist of negative comments about an individual or group 
that are made as part of a conversation.
Spam is unsolicited junk email. Although most email programs include a junk email filter, many of 
these emails still slip through to fill users’ inboxes, wasting users’ valuable time.
Health Issues in Computing
To combat eyestrain, situate your computer so it is 20 to 40 inches (50 to 100 centimeters) from 
your face, with your eyes just above the center of the screen. If necessary, adjust the angle of the 
screen. Work in incandescent lighting rather than fluorescent when possible, and position your 
monitor so that light does not shine directly on it. Use an LCD monitor if possible rather than a 
CRT; if you must use a CRT, set its refresh rate to at least 100 Hz. Use as large a monitor as pos-
sible, and take frequent breaks from looking at it.

A good working posture is one in which the body is relaxed and can maintain its position with 
minimal physical effort. Even if you use perfect posture, you should take frequent breaks to main-
tain back health. Position your desk and chair so that your thighs and forearms are parallel to the 
floor as you work.
Repetitive use of the mouse and keyboard can strain on the hand and wrist muscles, causing them 
to become swollen and painful. To help prevent this, ensure that your arms and wrists are correctly 
positioned. Use ergonomic input devices if they are available to further reduce strain.
Environmental Issues in Computer Disposal
To avoid damaging the environment, it’s important to dispose of your computer properly. Many 
countries now have regulations that govern the disposal process.
Rather than disposing of an old computer, consider harvesting the components and using them 
elsewhere. You could also sell the computer, donate it to a deserving person or charity, repurpose 
it, or keep it as a spare.

Windows 8 is more than just an upgrade to Windows 7; it reflects a shift in comput-
ing in general away from desktop PCs and toward portable tablets and touch screens. 
Most of the desktop PC features you have come to expect are still there, but there are 
also many enhancements geared toward making the computing experience easier for 
people who use tablet PCs that may not have regular keyboards or mice attached.
Windows 8 includes the desktop that you are already familiar with from earlier 
Windows versions, but it also contains a Start screen that is similar to the tile-based 
interface of other tablet operating systems such as on the iPad. You can customize 
this Start screen in a variety of ways so that its tiles are sized and arranged appro-
priately for the activities you do most often. It also comes with many useful free 
applications that run full-screen in a tablet-style interface.

Appendix A: What’s New in Windows 8.1?
NOTE
Microsoft releases updates to Windows periodically. Sometimes those updates are numbered, like Windows 8 
and Windows 8.1, but sometimes they are issued as service packs that don’t have special numbering. Therefore, 
even if you have Windows 8.1, you might not see exactly what’s shown here. This book’s illustrations were cap-
tured using Windows 8.1 Service Pack 1.
Windows 8.1 is an update to Windows 8, offering some additional fea-
tures and interface improvements. This appendix covers Windows 8.1. If 
you are currently working with Windows 8.0, you can get a free down-
load of Windows 8.1 from Microsoft. Ask your instructor or system 
administrator for help if needed. In this appendix, if a statement applies 
to both Windows 8.0 and 8.1, it is phrased as Windows 8. If a state-
ment applies to only one version or the other, the exact version number 
is used.
Step by Step
Signing In to Windows 8
Use these steps to sign in to Windows 8:
	 1.	From the Welcome screen, press any key.
	 2.	Click your user account.
	 3.	If prompted for your password, enter it and press Enter.
Starting and Ending Your Windows 8 
Session
To use Windows, you must sign in. When you are done using Windows, 
you can sign out (which returns to the sign-in screen so someone else 
can sign in) or you can shut the PC down completely, which also signs 
you out automatically.
Signing In
When you turn on your computer, you see a Welcome screen, which 
contains a full-screen graphic and today’s date and time. You can press 
any key or swipe up from the bottom of the screen (on a touch screen) 
to get to the sign-in screen.
To use the computer, you must sign in by identifying yourself to 
Windows and typing your password. Signing in tells Windows who you 
are, so that it can set itself up appropriately for your use (color prefer-
ences, personal files and shortcuts, and so on).
sign in To log into Windows 8 with a specific user 
account. Windows 8 uses the term sign-in instead 
of log-in, which is what earlier Windows versions 
used.
After you have signed in, the Start screen appears, as shown in 
Figure A.1. You will learn more about the Start screen in “Using the 
Start Screen” later in this appendix.

603
Appendix A: What’s New in Windows 8.1?
Figure A.1  The Start screen appears after you sign in.
Signing Out
When you are going to be away from your PC for a while, you may want 
to sign out or to lock the PC to prevent anyone else from accessing it 
through your account. When you sign out, Windows closes any open 
documents and applications, so that when you sign in again, nothing is 
open. Windows returns to the Welcome screen after you sign out, so that 
someone else who also has an account on that PC can sign in.
sign out To quit the Windows session for the 
currently signed-in user account.
Step by Step
Signing Out of Windows 8
Use these steps to sign out of Windows 8:
	 1.	If the Start screen doesn’t already appear, press the Windows key (
).
	 2.	On the Start screen, click your username in the upper-right corner.
	 3.	Click Sign Out on the menu that appears.

604
Appendix A: What’s New in Windows 8.1?
You might notice that there are a few other commands on the menu that 
appears when you click your user name. For example, the Lock command 
enables password-protection but does not close your running applications 
or open documents. If other user accounts are set up on this PC, they 
are listed at the bottom of the menu, and selecting one of those accounts 
signs in with that account. The previously signed-in account remains 
signed in but is inactive in the background. (Only one account can be 
active at a time.) You can later switch back to the original account by 
selecting it from the same menu.
Shutting Down the PC
If you are going to be away from your PC for a long time, you may want 
to shut it down to conserve electricity (or battery life). Shutting down 
closes all open applications and documents and then turns the PC’s 
power off completely, so that it stops drawing any power.
To shut down the PC, click the Power icon in the top-right corner of 
the Start screen, as shown in Figure A.2. On the menu that appears, click 
Shut Down.
Figure A.2  The Power icon’s menu.
lock To prevent unauthorized users from using a 
computer by displaying a password prompt.
shut down To quit Windows and turn the com-
puter’s power off.
Troubleshooting
No Power Icon?
If you don’t see a Power icon, you don’t have Service Pack 1 installed. It’s a free Windows update that you can get 
by allowing the Windows Update feature to download and install it.
Users without Service Pack 1 installed must use the Settings charm to display a panel containing the Power icon in 
order to shut down. You will learn about the Charms bar later in this appendix.
As shown in Figure A.2, the other commands on the Power icon’s menu 
are Sleep and Restart. Use Sleep to place the PC in a low power con-
sumption mode without having to shut down your running applications 
and open windows. When you return to the PC, the PC wakes up from 
its sleep within a few seconds, so you don’t have to wait for the PC to 
completely restart. The Restart command is like Shut Down except it 
immediately restarts the computer after it finishes its shutdown sequence. 
sleep To place the computer in a low power 
consumption mode without shutting down running 
programs.
restart To exit from Windows and restart it with-
out shutting off the computer’s power.

605
Appendix A: What’s New in Windows 8.1?
Use Restart when you are experiencing problems with an application or 
with Windows itself; often a restart will clear a minor problem such as a 
display abnormality or a keyboard or mouse behaving erratically.

Using the Start Screen
The Start screen is new in Windows 8, and it replaces the Start menu 
from previous versions. When you sign in, the Start screen appears auto-
matically (refer to Figure A.1).
Switching to the Start Screen
From any other screen, you can redisplay the Start screen by doing any 
of the following:
◾	 Press the Windows key (
).
◾	 Click the Start button in the lower-left corner of the desktop (not 
available in Windows 8.0).
◾	 Swipe in from the right (on a touch screen) to display the Charms 
bar and then click the Start charm. If you do not have a touch 
screen, drag the mouse to the bottom right hand corner of the 
screen and the Charms bar will appear. (You learn more about 
charms later in this appendix.)
The Start screen displays a collection of tiles. A tile is a rectangular block 
that represents a shortcut to an application (app), a file, or a hyperlink. 
The Start screen by default has a generic collection of tiles, including 
many of the free applications that come with Windows, such as Mail, 
Photos, and Weather; you can customize the tiles by adding and remov-
ing them, rearranging them, and changing their sizes. You will learn 
more about these customizations later in this appendix.
Some of the tiles are solid-colored and static; others are live tiles, which 
means the information shown on the tile previews the content. For 
example, the Photos tile may show previews of some of the images. To 
specify whether or not a particular tile is live, right-click the tile and click 
Turn Live Tile Off or Turn Live Tile On.
tile A square or rectangular block on the Start 
screen that represents an application or file.
live tile A tile on the Start screen that shows 
current information about a setting or status, such 
as a weather report or news headlines.

Switching to the Desktop
If you upgraded from Windows 7, you may be wondering where the 
desktop went. It’s still there, but it may not be displayed by default, 
depending on your Windows version and its configuration. To access the 
Windows desktop (see Figure A.3), do either of the following:
◾	 Click the Desktop tile on the Start screen.
◾	 Move the mouse pointer to the top-left corner of the screen, so 
that a preview of the desktop appears, and then click.
Figure A.3  The desktop in Windows 8.
Although the desktop is still an important part of Windows 8, it is no 
longer the starting point for running most applications. You can still 
place shortcuts to applications on the desktop’s taskbar, and on the desk-
top itself, but access to the full listing of installed apps is available only 
via the Start screen. For more information about the desktop, see the 
section “Using the Desktop in Windows 8” later in this appendix.
Starting and Exiting Apps
Two types of applications (apps) are available in Windows 8. The first is 
the traditional type that runs on earlier versions of Windows also. These 
are commonly called desktop apps because they run on the desktop, 
usually in resizable window frames.
The second is a new type called Windows 8 apps, which have the fol-
lowing properties:
◾	 They run only under Windows 8.
◾	 They run full-screen.
◾	 Right-clicking displays a command bar from which you can select 
commands.
◾	 There is no menu system and no icon bar.
desktop app A traditional style Windows pro-
gram that runs in a window on the desktop.
Windows 8 app A new style of application that 
runs full-screen and is optimized for touch-screen 
use.

Appendix A: What’s New in Windows 8.1?
Figure A.4 shows the Calendar app that comes with Windows 8 after 
right-clicking to display the command bar. This particular app has two 
command bars: one at the top and one at the bottom.
Figure A.4  Calendar is a typical Windows 8 app.
Windows 8 apps are typically simpler than desktop applications, with 
fewer features, and their commands and buttons tend to be larger. That’s 
because Windows 8 apps are designed to be used with a touch-screen 
interface such as a tablet. In some cases, Windows 8 provides two sepa-
rate versions of the same application, one with the desktop interface and 
one with the Windows 8 interface. Internet Explorer is one example, and 
Calculator is another.
NOTE
You may occasionally hear Windows 8 apps referred to as Metro apps. Microsoft had planned to use that 
terminology for Windows 8 apps, but the term was dropped before Windows 8 was officially released due to 
copyright issues. Some websites and magazines still use the Metro name, however.
You can start both types of applications from the Start screen. If an appli-
cation has a tile on the Start screen, you can simply click that tile to start 
the application. You can scroll the Start screen to the right to see more 
tiles if they are not all visible at once. To scroll, drag the scroll bar at the 
bottom of the screen using the mouse, or use your finger to drag from 
right to left on the center of the screen if you are using a touch screen. 
If there is no tile for the application you want, see the later section, 
“Locating an App,” to learn how to find and start it.
The process for exiting an app depends on what type of app it is. If it 
is a desktop app, you can exit it by clicking the Close (X) button in the 
upper-right corner of its window, as you would in Windows 7.

608
Appendix A: What’s New in Windows 8.1?
To exit a Windows 8 app, you can do either of the following:
◾	 If you have Windows 8.1 Service Pack 1 or higher, move the 
mouse pointer to the top of the screen. A black title bar appears 
with a Close (X) button on the right end, as shown in Figure A.5. 
Click the Close button.
◾	 In any Windows 8 version, move the mouse pointer to the top of 
the screen and then hold down the left mouse button and drag 
down to the bottom.
Figure A.5  Move the mouse pointer to the top of the screen in a Windows 8 app for a title bar containing  
a Close button.
Viewing Two Windows 8 Apps at Once
If you drag from the top of a Windows 8 app window to the right or 
left rather than straight down, and then drop it on the left or right side 
of the screen, you set up a split-screen situation where you can have two 
Windows 8 apps open at once. After dropping an app on one side of the 
screen, press the Windows key to return to the Start screen and start 
another app. The two apps will appear side by side, as in Figure A.6.
Figure A.6  Two Windows 8 apps can be open side by side.
You can drag the divider to the right or left to change which app has the 
greater share of the screen space, and you can close each of the two apps 
individually by dragging down from the top of the app to the bottom.

609
Appendix A: What’s New in Windows 8.1?
Locating an App
Not all available applications appear as tiles on the Start screen. If you do 
not see the app you want to run, click the down-arrow button at the bot-
tom of the Start screen to display the Apps list, shown in Figure A.7. This 
list is like the Start menu in Windows 7; it contains all available applications.
Figure A.7  The Apps list shows all available applications.
If you know the name of the app you are seeking, or at least a few letters 
of the name, you can type those letters into the Search box, and the list 
will filter itself to show only apps that match your criteria. For example, in 
Figure A.8, I typed ca and only apps that contain those two letters in the 
name appear.
Figure A.8  You can type a partial or full name of an app to filter the list.

610
Appendix A: What’s New in Windows 8.1?
Displaying a Command Bar
Windows 8 apps do not have menus or toolbars; instead they have com-
mand bars. A command bar appears when you right-click in a Windows 8 
app. Depending on the app, the command bar may appear above or 
below the main content, or in some cases in both places. Figure A.4 
shows the Calendar app with command bars at both the top and the bot-
tom of the screen. When a command bar is visible, you can click any com-
mand on it to select it. Some of the buttons on the command bars open 
menus for even more choices. The display will vary from app to app.
Switching between Windows 8 Apps
You can have multiple Windows 8 apps open at once, but you can view 
only one at a time (or two if you use the split screen, described earlier in 
the appendix).
As of Windows 8.1 Service Pack 1, Windows 8 apps appear on the taskbar 
along with other running apps. To display the taskbar, move the mouse 
pointer to the bottom of the screen. Then click the app you want to 
switch to.
Another method of switching among Windows 8 apps also works with all 
Windows 8 versions, even if you don’t have the latest updates installed. To 
use it, move the mouse pointer to the upper-left corner of the screen. A 
thumbnail image of one of the open app windows appears. (The desktop is 
considered an app window, so the thumbnail you see might be one of the 
desktop.) You can click that thumbnail to switch to that app, or you can 
move the mouse downward to make a black bar appear containing thumb-
nails of all the open apps, as shown in Figure A.9. Then just select the one 
you want to switch to. This method shows only Windows 8 apps; you can 
access your desktop apps from the taskbar as you would in Windows 7.
Figure A.9  To switch among Windows 8 apps, display thumbnails of the open apps and 
make your selection.

Appendix A: What’s New in Windows 8.1?
Customizing the Start Screen
You can customize the Start screen in a variety of ways to make it easier 
and more convenient to use. For example, you can customize which tiles 
appear and in what order, and you can change the sizes of the tiles. In 
the following sections, you will learn several ways to customize the Start 
screen.
Pinning and Unpinning Apps
Each of the tiles on the Start screen is a pinned shortcut to something. 
Some tiles represent applications; others represent hyperlinks that open 
in Internet Explorer to access web content, or data files that open in 
their native applications. Most of the preset tiles represent applications.
When you display the Apps list, as you learned in the previous section, 
the complete list of available applications appears. You can pin any of the 
applications you find there to the Start screen by right-clicking its name 
and choosing Pin to Start. See Figure A.10 for an example.
Figure A.10  Right-click an application on the  
Apps list and choose Pin to Start.
To unpin an item from the Start screen, right-click the tile and choose 
Unpin from Start. Unpinning an app does not remove it from the Apps 
list; you can access it any time you like from there.
Resizing Tiles
You can change the size of the tiles pinned to the Start screen. To change 
a tile’s size, right-click the tile, point to Resize, and then click the desired 
size. Figure A.11 shows the menu and examples of the sizes.
Rearranging and Grouping Tiles
You can rearrange the tiles on the Start screen by dragging them. To 
drag a tile, click and hold down the mouse button for a few seconds and 
then drag the tile where you want it.
You can also group tiles. When you right-click the Start screen and 
choose Name Groups, notice that a Name Group bar appears above each 
of several sets of tiles. You can group the tiles by dragging them from 
place to place, and you can name the groups by typing text in the Name 
Group box above the desired group.

612
Appendix A: What’s New in Windows 8.1?
Figure A.11  Resize a tile by right-clicking it and choosing Resize, and then picking the 
desired size.
Unpinning Tiles
Unpinning a tile from the Start screen does not uninstall the application 
it represents. The tiles on the Start screen are merely shortcuts to the 
actual applications, and you can still access an application from the Apps 
list even if its shortcut has been removed from the Start screen.

Using the Charms Bar and Taskbar
The Charms bar is a thin bar containing five charms along the right side 
of the screen. It appears when you swipe in from the right (on a touch 
screen) or when you move the mouse pointer to the lower-right corner 
of the screen. Charms are icons that display panels containing com-
mands for accomplishing a certain kind of task. If you access the Charms 
bar via the mouse method, it appears with a transparent background at 
first, but the background becomes solid black when you move the mouse 
upward toward one of the charms. See Figure A.12.

charms Icons that appear in a Charms bar 
when it is activated. These icons open parts of the 
Windows interface, such as Search or Settings.

613
Appendix A: What’s New in Windows 8.1?
NOTE
When you access the Charms bar via the mouse method, the charms at first appear on a transparent back-
ground, but when you move the mouse upward toward the charms, the background becomes solid black, as in 
Figure A.12. In contrast, when you access the Charms bar via the touch-screen swiping method, the Charms 
bar always has a black background.
Figure A.12  Access the Charms bar by swiping in from the right or moving the mouse 
pointer to the bottom-left corner of the screen.
The icons on the Charms bar are:
◾	 Search: Use this to locate folders, files, and settings.
◾	 Share: If in an application that supports it, use this to share con-
tent with others. For example, while viewing the Weather app, you 
can choose to send weather information to someone in an email 
message.
◾	 Start: Returns you to the Start screen if you are not already there.
◾	 Devices: Enables you to quickly access hardware devices, such as 
printers and projectors.
◾	 Settings: Opens an app you can use to configure system settings.
When you select a charm, a panel appears along the right side of the 
screen containing the options available for that charm at the moment. 
The options that appear may differ depending on several factors, includ-
ing the active application and the connected hardware.
The Settings charm enables you to access many types of personalization 
settings for Windows 8, and provides information about network con-
nectivity, sound volume, display brightness, and keyboard layout. It also 
provides access to the Power button, as you saw earlier in this appendix, 

614
Appendix A: What’s New in Windows 8.1?
to notifications, and to the Help 
system. Figure A.13 shows the panel 
that appears when you select the 
Settings charm from the Start screen.
The Search charm enables you to 
quickly find almost any folder, file, or 
setting on your computer. You can 
choose to search everywhere, or to 
limit your search in any of these ways: 
◾	 Settings: Searches for your key-
word only among the Windows 
settings and options.
◾	 Files: Searches for your key-
word only in filenames and in 
the content of data files, such 
as files from Office applications 
like Word and Excel.
◾	 Web images: Searches for your 
keyword online, limiting the 
search to images.
◾	 Web videos: Searches for your 
keyword online, limiting the 
search to videos.
The range of search options varies 
according to the version of Windows 
8.1 that you have installed.
After selecting the Search charm, you can open the Everywhere drop-
down list in the search pane that appears and then select one of the 
preceding search types. See Figure A.14.
Figure A.14  Limit the search to a certain type  
of results if desired.

Appendix A: What’s New in Windows 8.1?
Using the Taskbar in Windows 8
The desktop is still very much a part of Windows 8, although it no 
longer automatically appears when you sign in. You learned earlier in 
this appendix several ways to switch between the Start screen and the 
desktop.
Like earlier Windows versions, Windows 8’s desktop has a taskbar. The task-
bar contains a Start button at the far left (except in Windows 8.0); you can 
use this to return to the Start screen any time you like. You can also right-
click the Start button for a menu providing quick access to many of the most 
common commands and locations you might want to work with, as shown 
in Figure A.15.
Figure A.15  Right-click the Start button for a  
shortcut menu of commonly accessed locations.
At the left end of the taskbar are pinned shortcuts. By default there 
are two: Internet Explorer and File Explorer. (File Explorer is the file 
management interface; it is essentially the same as Windows Explorer in 
earlier Windows versions.)
To the right of the pinned shortcuts are buttons for any open windows 
and applications. If one of the open windows is also one of the pinned 
shortcuts, the pinned shortcut appears with a highlighted background, 
as for File Explorer in Figure A.16. Other open windows in Figure A.16 
are Weather (a Windows 8 app) and Microsoft Word. At the right end 
of the taskbar is the notification area; the icons here represent applica-
tions or utilities that are running in the background, such as monitoring 
programs for sound, power, and networking and antivirus software.
Figure A.16  The taskbar in Windows 8 uses icons to show pinned or open windows.

616
Appendix A: What’s New in Windows 8.1?
If you find yourself using the desktop more than the Start screen, you 
might want to pin shortcuts to the taskbar for the applications you use 
the most. To do so, locate the application on the Apps list (from the 
Start screen), and then right-click it and choose Pin to Taskbar from 
the command bar that appears. To unpin an application from the task-
bar, right-click it on the taskbar and on the shortcut menu that appears, 
choose Unpin This Program from Taskbar.

Working with File Explorer
File Explorer is the Windows 8 replacement for Windows Explorer, the 
file management interface. It is similar to Windows Explorer but has a 
few improvements.
To access File Explorer, click the File Explorer pinned shortcut on the 
taskbar. File Explorer has a Ribbon, like Office apps do, rather than a 
menu system. Across the top are tabs (File, Computer, and View); click a 
tab to see a page of icons from which to select. For example, Figure A.17 
shows the View tab, from which you can control the view of the file list-
ing. As in the Office applications, the File tab is special; it opens a menu 
rather than displaying a Ribbon page.
Some other ways that File Explorer is different from Windows Explorer are:
◾	 You now open it from the pinned shortcut on the taskbar, not from 
the Start menu.
◾	 It opens to a screen called This PC, which is the same location as 
what Windows 7 called Computer.
◾	 Libraries are no longer enabled by default; the shortcuts in the 
Favorites group refer to individual folders rather than library loca-
tions and the traditional libraries of Documents, Pictures, Music, 
and Videos now appear in the This PC screen. You can enable 
the use of libraries if you want to by right-clicking in the naviga-
tion pane and choosing Show Libraries. If you enable libraries, the 
Libraries window appears instead of This PC when you access the 
pinned shortcut on the taskbar.
◾	 Windows 8 is fully integrated with OneDrive, Microsoft’s cloud 
storage system, and a shortcut to OneDrive appears in the naviga-
tion pane.
File Explorer The file management utility in 
Windows 8.

617
Appendix A: What’s New in Windows 8.1?
Figure A.17  File Explorer uses a tabbed Ribbon for commands.
To customize the File Explorer window, use the controls on the View tab. 
For example, you can choose what appears in the navigation pane (the left 
pane) by clicking the Navigation Pane button and then choosing com-
mands from the menu that appears. Here are the options on that menu:
◾	 Navigation Pane: Displays or hides the navigation pane itself.
◾	 Expand to Open Folder: When a folder’s content is displayed in 
the main (right) pane, the folder tree in the navigation pane will 
expand to show that folder’s location when this option is selected.
◾	 Show All Folders: When this option is selected, the navigation 
pane includes shortcuts for special folders such as the Control Panel 
and Recycle Bin.
◾	 Show Libraries: When this option is selected, the navigation pane 
includes an expandable Libraries heading under which all libraries 
appear. This is the same command as the Show Libraries command 
you see when you right-click the navigation pane.
◾	 Show Favorites: When this option is selected, a Favorites list is 
available at the top of the navigation pane, where you can drag and 
drop your most-used locations.

618
Appendix A: What’s New in Windows 8.1?
You can also click the Preview Pane or the Details Pane button to toggle 
one of those panes off or on. (Those two panes are mutually exclusive; 
both cannot be on at the same time.)
Windows 8 makes it easier than ever before to customize the file dis-
play listing itself. Using check boxes on the View tab, as shown in 
Figure A.17, you can toggle the display of file name extensions and of 
hidden items on and off. In earlier Windows versions, you had to open 
the Folder Options dialog box to make those changes. You can still open 
the Folder Options dialog box if you like, by clicking the Options button 
on the View tab, for more file management settings.
Another way that Windows 8 improves file management ease is that each 
file and folder now has a check box; when you move the cursor over a file 
name a check box appears to the left of the file name. You can mark the 
item’s check box to select the item, and then issue commands that act 
upon all selected items. Selecting with check boxes is easier than having 
to hold down Shift or Ctrl as you click multiple items to select, which 
was the only method available in earlier Windows versions. If you dislike 
the check boxes and don’t want to use them, you can disable them by 
clearing the Item check boxes option on the View tab.

	 2.	 What location opens when you click the File Explorer icon in the taskbar?
	 3.	 How do you enable the use of libraries, and how does that change your answer to the preceding question?
Working with User Accounts
When Windows was installed, a user account was created. You can 
optionally create additional accounts so that each person who uses the 
PC can have his or her individual settings. These settings include sepa-
rate Favorites lists in Internet Explorer, separate display personalization 
choices, and separate libraries for storing data files.
Windows 8 supports two types of user accounts: a Microsoft account 
and a local account. A Microsoft account is the default account type. A 
Microsoft account has many advantages, including the capability to seam-
lessly access your OneDrive online storage, work with contacts and updates 
from social media sites, buy new apps in the Windows store, and automati-
cally sync your personal settings such as color preferences and web browser 
favorites between multiple PCs that you use. To set up that type of account, 
you must provide a valid email address, and you must create a password, 
both of which are stored online at Microsoft. A local account is a Windows 
user account that exists only on this PC, and there is no record of it online. 
Local accounts provide more privacy, but not as many features.
Windows 8 also supports two security permission levels, just like in 
Windows 7: Standard and Administrator. An Administrator account can 
make changes to all system settings (such as adding and removing appli-
cations); a Standard account can change only settings that do not affect 
other users (such as desktop wallpaper and display resolution).
Microsoft account A user account that is 
registered with Microsoft, allowing use of online 
features such as OneDrive and social media 
connections.
local account A user account that exists only 
on a specific computer and is not linked to any 
online identity.

619
Appendix A: What’s New in Windows 8.1?
NOTE
As in Windows 7, Microsoft recommends that the account you use on a day-to-day basis be a Standard 
account, because malware will be able to do less damage with a Standard account. You can log into an 
Administrator account when you need to make system changes.
Step by Step
Creating a New User Account from the PC Settings App
Use these steps to create a new standard Microsoft user account:
	 1.	From the Start screen, display the Charms bar and click the Settings charm.
	 2.	Click Change PC Settings.
	 3.	Click Accounts if the Accounts screen does not already appear and then click Other Accounts.
	 4.	Click Add an Account.
	 5.	Type the email address to use for this person’s sign-in. If that user already has a Microsoft account, use the email 
address associated with it. Then click Next.
	 6.	If prompted for other details, enter them as prompted, including name, email address, password, and country. 
Then click Next. You will not be prompted if this email address has been used for a Microsoft account previously. 
If you are not prompted, skip to Step 8.
	 7.	Continue entering information as prompted until you see The following user will be able to sign in to this PC.
	 8.	Click Finish.

Summary
Starting and Ending Your Windows 8 Session
When you start a Windows 8 PC, a Welcome screen appears with a picture and the current date 
and time. Press any key to access the sign-in screen. Then click your user account and type your 
password.
To sign out, click your user name in the upper-right corner of the Start screen and then click Sign 
Out. You can also lock the computer from that same menu. To shut down the computer, put it 
in Sleep mode, or restart it, click the Power icon in the upper-right corner of the Start screen and 
then choose the appropriate command from the menu that appears.
Using the Start Screen
The Start screen replaces the Start menu in Windows 8. You can display it at any time by pressing 
the Windows key or clicking the Start button. The Start screen displays a collection of tiles. Some 
tiles are set to be live tiles, which means they display information updates on the tiles, such as the 
current weather conditions on the Weather app.
To switch to the desktop, click the Desktop tile on the Start screen, or move the mouse pointer to 
the bottom-right corner of the screen and then click.
Two kinds of applications exist: traditional desktop apps like in Windows 7, and new Windows 8 
apps that are optimized for touch-screen use. In a Windows 8 app, right-click to display a com-
mand bar that contains commands you can issue. To close a Windows 8 app, move the mouse 
pointer to the top of the screen and then either drag downward or click the Close (X) button.
To view two Windows 8 apps at once, start one of them and then drag from the top of the screen 
to the middle, and then drag to the right or left. Then return to the Start screen and start another 
app, which appears on the other side of the screen. You can drag the divider between the two 
panes.
To start an application that doesn’t appear on the Start screen, click the down arrow at the bottom 
of the Start screen to see the Apps list, which is the equivalent of the Start menu in Windows 7.
Windows 8 apps are included on the taskbar. To display the taskbar from within a Windows 8 app, 
move the mouse pointer to the bottom of the screen.
You can customize the Start screen. To pin or unpin apps, right-click the app and choose Pin to 
Start or Unpin from Start. To resize a tile, right-click it, point to Resize, and choose the desired 
size. To rearrange tiles, click and hold on a tile and then drag it to a new position.
Using the Charms Bar and Taskbar
The Charms bar is a thin bar containing five charms along the right side of the screen. It appears 
when you swipe in from the right (on a touch screen) or when you move the mouse pointer to 
the lower-right corner of the screen. Charms are icons that display panels containing commands 
for accomplishing a certain kind of task. The five charms are Search, Share, Start, Devices, and 
Settings.
On the taskbar is a Start button at the far left, which opens the Start screen. Next are pinned 
shortcuts, followed by a big blank area where icons for running applications and open windows 
appear. At the right end is the notification area and the clock, just like in Windows 7.

File Explorer is the Windows 8 replacement for Windows Explorer, the file management inter-
face. It is similar to Windows Explorer but has a few improvements. It opens from the pinned 
shortcut on the taskbar. It opens to This PC, which is the same as Computer in Windows 7. 
Libraries are no longer enabled by default.
You can customize File Explorer with the commands on the View tab. Click the Navigation Pane 
button on the View tab for options that control what appears in the navigation pane on the left.
Working with User Accounts
Windows 8 supports two types of user accounts: a Microsoft account and a local account. A 
Microsoft account has many advantages, but requires you to enter an email address and register it 
as a Microsoft account.
Windows 8 also supports two security permission levels, just like in Windows 7: Standard and 
Administrator.

Customizing 
­Windows 7
Learning objectives
◽	 Customize the keyboard, mouse, and display screen elements
◽	 Adjust language and time settings for your location
Windows 7 requires very little maintenance. Once it is installed, you can use it 
productively every day without putting much thought into what is happening 
behind the scenes. You are free to focus on the applications you run for work, 
education, or play.
However, there may be some times when you want to make a change to the way 
Windows operates. You might want to change a system setting, such as adjusting 
the mouse pointer speed, or customize the interface by changing the monitor reso-
lution or the background color. This appendix shows you some simple ways you 
can customize Windows 7 so that it looks and behaves just as you would like it to.
Customizing the 
Interface
Changing Location-
Based Settings

626
Appendix B: Customizing Windows 7
Customizing the Interface
The user interface (UI) enables you to communicate with the com-
puter. It includes the input devices that convey your commands and 
enter data, such as the keyboard and mouse, and also the display that you 
see on the screen.
You can customize the UI in several ways. You can adjust the way the 
input devices work, for example, and you can control many aspects of 
the display screen—not only the colors and fonts that it uses, but also 
the tools and features it includes. You will learn about some of the most 
common settings in the following sections.
Adjusting the Keyboard and  
Mouse Settings
The keyboard and the mouse are the two most popular computer input 
devices. Most of them work well with the default settings, but you might 
find that adjusting how one or both of them operate can make the user 
interface more comfortable for you to use. See “Changing the Keyboard 
Layout” later in this appendix for information about using a different 
keyboard layout (for example, for typing in a different language).
To customize the keyboard, open the Keyboard Properties dialog box 
from the Control Panel. (The easiest way to find it is to type keyboard in 
the Search box in the upper-right corner of the Control Panel window.)
Some of the settings you can change for the keyboard pertain to a feature 
called Repeat. When you hold down a key, after a certain amount of time 
the character represented by that key begins repeating on the screen rap-
idly. This feature enables you to create a row of dotted lines by holding 
down the period key, for example. The repeat delay setting determines 
how long Windows delays after you start holding down the key before 
the character beings repeating. The repeat rate determines how quickly 
the character repeats once it gets started doing so. You can also adjust the 
cursor blink rate, which determines how fast the cursor blinks.
You can also make many adjustments in how the mouse operates. The 
most commonly customized settings for a mouse are:
◾	 Button configuration: You can switch the functions of the right 
and left mouse buttons. This might be useful for someone who 
is left-handed and prefers to use the mouse on the left side of the 
computer.
◾	 Double-click speed: You can change the minimum threshold for 
how quickly the two clicks need to be in succession to be consid-
ered a double-click instead of two separate clicks.
◾	 Pointers: The default mouse pointer scheme in Windows 7 uses a 
small white arrow as the main pointer. It also defines graphics for 
many other pointer situations too, such as the graphic to appear 
while Windows is busy, when the pointer is over a clickable hyper-
link, and when the pointer is over the border of a resizable window. 
You can choose a different scheme, or you can customize each of 
the pointers individually.
user interface (UI) The interface that a human 
uses to communicate with a computer.
repeat delay The amount of time between when 
a key is held down and when it starts repeating.
repeat rate The speed at which a key repeats 
after the repeat delay period has passed.
cursor Also called the insertion point, the blink-
ing vertical line that appears in a text box or other 
area that can accept text input.

627
Appendix B: Customizing Windows 7
◾	 Motion: You can control how far the pointer onscreen moves 
in relation to the amount of mouse movement. This setting is 
adjusted on the Pointer Options tab.
NOTE
If you have a custom pointing device installed that has its own software, the Mouse Properties dialog box may 
look different from the one described and shown in this appendix, and you may have some different settings.

Appendix B: Customizing Windows 7
Customizing the Taskbar
As you learned in Chapter 5, “Introduction to Windows 7,” the taskbar 
is the bar across the bottom of the screen. The Start button is at the left 
end, and the clock is at the right end. In between them are various icons 
and shortcuts.
Here are some ways you can customize the taskbar:
◾	 Lock Taskbar: You can lock or unlock the taskbar. When it’s 
locked, it can’t be moved or resized and the toolbars on it can’t be 
resized. Keeping it locked except when you want to make changes 
ensures that there are no accidental changes made.
	 8.	Drag the Motion slider to adjust the pointer speed. Click 
Apply and then move the mouse to test the setting. Adjust 
as needed and click Apply again.
	 9.	Click OK to close the dialog box.
	10.	Close the Control Panel window.
TIP
You can lock or unlock the taskbar by right-clicking it and choosing the Lock the Taskbar command. 
◾	 Auto-Hide Taskbar: You can auto-hide the taskbar. When this 
option is enabled, the taskbar disappears when you aren’t using it. 
To make it reappear, move the mouse to the bottom of the screen 
and it pops into place. Auto-hiding the taskbar provides a little 
more room for application windows.
◾	 Icon Size: You can choose an icon size (small or large) for the 
icons on the taskbar. When the Use Small Icons option is enabled, 
the icons on the taskbar are smaller than when the option is dis-
abled. Smaller icons take up less space, but the icons may be easier 
to see at the larger size. Figure B.1 compares the two sizes.

630
Appendix B: Customizing Windows 7
Figure B.1  Small icons on the taskbar (above) versus large ones (below).
◾	 Taskbar Location: You can change the taskbar location. By 
default, it is at the bottom of the screen but you can move it to the 
top, left, or right.
◾	 Combine Buttons for the Same Application: You can choose 
whether or not to combine buttons for different items in the same 
application on the taskbar. The default is to combine them only 
when the taskbar is full, but you can choose to always or never 
combine. Figure B.2 shows a full taskbar with the icons for all the 
Word documents combined. Pointing at the combined icons pro-
duces a jump list of the names of the documents; you can click one 
of those names to quickly jump to that document.
jump list A list of files that appears when you 
hover the mouse pointer over a program icon on 
the taskbar.
Figure B.2  Combined icons on the taskbar. Point at the combined stack to see a list of the documents in the stack.
◾	 Choose Notification Area Icons: You can customize which icons 
appear in the notification area. As you learned in Chapter 5, the 
notification area is the area just to the left of the clock, where icons 
appear for programs that run in the background. Certain icons 
appear there all the time, whereas others are hidden until you click 
the up-pointing arrow to display them, as shown in Figure B.3. 
You can choose one of three settings:
◾	 Show icon and notifications: The icon will always appear. 
Use this setting for applications you interact with frequently, 
such as the volume control and your instant messaging pro-
gram.
◾	 Hide icon and notifications: The icon will not appear even 
if the program wants to show you a message. Use this for pro-
grams you never want to interact with.
◾	 Only show notifications: The icon will not appear unless the 
program has a message to show you, in which case it will ap-
pear in the notification area until you have read the message. 
Use this for programs that you usually don’t interact with but 
that you want to be made aware of if there is a problem.
	
You can also enable or disable each of the system icons that 
can potentially appear in the notification area: Clock, Volume, 
Network, Power, and Action Center.

631
Appendix B: Customizing Windows 7
Step by Step
Customizing the Taskbar
Use this procedure to set up the taskbar to work best for your needs:
	 1.	Right-click the taskbar and choose Properties. The 
Taskbar and Start Menu Properties dialog box opens.
	 2.	On the Taskbar tab, mark or clear the following check 
boxes as desired:
a.	 Lock the taskbar
b.	 Auto-hide the taskbar
c.	 Use small icons
	 3.	Open the Taskbar Location on Screen drop-down list and 
select the desired location. Bottom is the default. If the 
Taskbar is unlocked you can click the bar and drag it to 
the desired location, then release the mouse button.
	 4.	Open the Taskbar Buttons drop-down list and select a 
behavior for combining taskbar buttons.
	 5.	Click OK to close the dialog box.
◾	 Display or Hide Taskbar Toolbars: 
You can display a number of optional 
toolbars on the taskbar. Some of them 
can be useful, but each one takes up 
space that could otherwise be used 
for the buttons for running programs. 
For example, the Address toolbar, 
shown in Figure B.4, enables you to 
enter commands or searches without 
opening the Start menu. You can 
choose to display or hide each avail-
able toolbar individually.
Figure B.4  The Address toolbar shown here is one example of the several optional toolbars you can display on the taskbar.
◾	 Resize the Taskbar: The taskbar is one row high by default. You 
can make it thicker so that it can display more rows (useful if you 
have a lot of windows open at once).
◾	 Pin and Unpin Items on the Taskbar: The icons to the right of 
the Start button are pinned to the taskbar. By default, Internet 
Explorer and Windows Explorer are pinned there, but you might 
have other programs pinned there, too. You can pin shortcuts there 
for quick use, or unpin shortcuts for items you don’t use much.
pin To attach a shortcut to a program or data file 
to a certain menu or toolbar.
Figure B.3  You can specify which programs appear in the 
main part of the notification area and which programs are on the 
pop-up list.

	 2.	Click the Toolbars tab.
	 3.	Click to mark or clear the check box for each toolbar.
	 4.	Click OK.
Shortcut Menu Method:
	 1.	Right-click the taskbar and point to Toolbars. A pop-up menu appears of the toolbars. Toolbars already displayed 
have a check mark next to the name.
	 2.	Click the toolbar to enable or disable.

634
Appendix B: Customizing Windows 7
Resizing the Taskbar
Follow these steps to resize the taskbar:
	 1.	First, deselect the Lock the taskbar option and select Apply. Position the mouse pointer over the upper edge of the 
taskbar until the symbol changes to a double headed arrow.
	 2.	Drag upward or downward to adjust the size.
Pinning a Program to the Taskbar
Use this procedure to pin an item to the taskbar:
	 1.	Click the Start button.
	 2.	Locate the program you want to pin to the taskbar. Use All Programs to browse if needed.
	 3.	Right-click the program and choose Pin to Taskbar.
Removing a Pinned Program from the Taskbar
To unpin a program, follow these steps:
	 1.	Right-click the pinned program on the taskbar.
	 2.	Click Unpin This Program from Taskbar.
Customizing the Start Menu
The Start menu contains links to many of the most common folders and 
utilities. You can easily customize those links in a variety of ways.
One way you can change the Start menu is to make certain items into 
menus rather than links. For example, if Computer is set to be a menu, 
a menu of top-level items appears when you click Computer, as in 
Figure B.5. You can then click the desired item to open the Windows 
Explorer window starting at the chosen location. This same option 
is available for several folders too, including Control Panel, Games, 
Documents, and Pictures.

635
Appendix B: Customizing Windows 7
Figure B.5  Some Start menu items can be set to appear as menus.
You can also choose for some items to not appear on the Start menu at 
all, such as Default Programs or Devices and Printers. Hiding unneeded 
items on the Start menu can make it more tidy and compact. In addition, 
by default, some items don’t appear, but you might want them to appear, 
such as Favorites, Videos, and the Run command.
The Start menu contains shortcuts to recently run programs in the 
lower-left section. You can control how many recent programs appear 
here. The default is ten; Figure B.5 shows six. The larger the number 
you choose, the taller the Start menu may grow to be; a smaller number 
will result in a shorter Start menu. If privacy is an issue, you can also 
choose to disable the feature altogether so that no recently opened pro-
grams appear at all.
You can pin frequently used programs to the top left section of the task-
bar so that they are constantly available, even when they don’t appear on 
the list of recently run programs. To pin a program, right-click its short-
cut on the Start menu (for example, from the recently run programs list 
or from the All Programs list) and choose Pin to Start Menu.

Changing the Screen Resolution
Screen resolution is the number of pixels horizontally and vertically that 
comprise the display. For example, most screens shown in this book use 
1024 × 768 screen resolution. At higher resolutions, the icons and text 
on the desktop appear smaller in proportion to the desktop background. 
Figure B.6 compares two resolutions.
Figure B.6  A desktop display at 1600 x 900 (left) and 1024 x 768 (right).
screen resolution The number of pixels used 
to form the display image, expressed as width × 
height, like this: 1024 × 768.

638
Appendix B: Customizing Windows 7
Different screen resolutions can have different aspect ratios. A wide-
screen display like the one shown on the left side of Figure B.6 has an 
aspect ratio of 16:9. In other words, for every 16 pixels horizontally 
there are 9 pixels vertically. A standard aspect ratio like the one shown on 
the right side of Figure B.6 has an aspect ratio of approximately 4:3.
aspect ratio The ratio of width to height in the 
number of pixels in a display.
On most flat-screen monitors, the display looks best at the maximum 
resolution. At lower resolutions, the display may appear fuzzy and the 
text may not be crisply defined. Fortunately, Windows has a setting that 
enables you to make the text and icons on your screen larger without 
changing display resolutions. In the Control Panel, under Appearance 
and Personalization, there is an option to make text and other items 
larger or smaller. As shown in Figure B.7, Smaller – 100% is the default 
size. You can choose Medium – 125% or Larger – 150% to increase the 
text and icon size. There is a drawback, however; some items may not 
fit on your screen at the higher settings, or may look strange, because 
the application they are associated with is not aware of Windows hav-
ing made the size change. The only way to know how it will affect your 
screen and the applications you use is to try it out; it’s easy to reverse the 
setting if you are not happy with the results.
Figure B.7  You can make text and other items on the screen larger without decreasing the 
screen resolution.
Put It to Work
Choosing the Right Resolution
When selecting a screen resolution, keep your monitor’s aspect ratio in mind; if you choose a screen resolution 
with a different aspect ratio than your monitor, the display might be distorted. If you aren’t sure what aspect ratio 
a particular screen resolution represents, divide the larger number by the smaller one. If it comes out to approxi-
mately 1.78, it’s a widescreen aspect ratio. If it comes out to approximately 1.3, it’s standard. Or if you don’t want 
to pull out your calculator and do the math, you can just try different aspect ratios until you find one that seems to 
fit your monitor well.

639
Appendix B: Customizing Windows 7
For instructions on changing the screen resolution, see Chapter 17, 
“Legal, Ethical, Health, and Environmental Issues in Computing.”
Step by Step
Changing the Text and Icon Size
To change the size of your text and icons, follow these steps:
	 1.	Right-click the desktop and choose Screen Resolution.
	 2.	Click the Make Text and Other Items Larger or Smaller hyperlink.
	 3.	Click Smaller, Medium, or Larger.
	 4.	Click Apply.
	 5.	If prompted to log off, click Log Off Now. When you log back in, the new text and icon size will be in effect.
Personalizing the Desktop
You work with the desktop almost constantly when working in Windows, 
so you will probably want to adjust its appearance to be pleasing to you. 
You can make several changes to the desktop. For example, you can 
change the background image to your favorite photo, an abstract design, 
or a solid color. You can also change the window color, the sounds 
that Windows makes as it operates, and the screen saver. To access the 
interface for changing the desktop right-click the desktop and choose 
Personalize. The Personalization screen appears, as shown in Figure B.8.
Figure B.8  Personalize the Windows desktop in one or more ways.

Appendix B: Customizing Windows 7
As a time-saver, Windows 7 provides themes, which are preset combina-
tions of formatting features. A theme specifies one or more background 
graphics plus window color settings; some themes also specify system 
sounds. Themes can be Aero themes, meaning they use features that are 
part of the Aero interface, or they can be Basic themes, which do not use 
those features. You can create your own themes by saving your current 
Windows settings as a new theme. A number of high-contrast themes 
are also included along with the basic themes; high-contrast themes are 
often useful to people with limited vision.
theme A named set of formatting presets, gov-
erning font, color, and object effect choices.
Aero theme A theme that uses Aero features 
such as semi-transparent window borders.
high-contrast theme A theme that uses starkly 
contrasting colors for adjacent items, such as 
window borders and the Windows desktop, to 
make them easier to see.
NOTE
Aero is the term Microsoft uses for the high-tech visual design of Windows 7. Its features include semi-
transparent windows (called Aero Glass) and several types of animations, like animated opening and closing 
effects for windows. Not all systems support Aero. Aero isn’t available if you are using the Starter or Home 
Basic version of Windows 7, and you can’t use it if your computer’s display hardware fails to meet the mini-
mum standards for Aero. Microsoft discontinued Aero in Windows 8.
Selecting a Desktop Background
Windows 7 comes with many interesting and attractive desktop back-
ground photos and abstract graphics. You can choose any of those, or 
you can use your own photos. Select the location to browse from the 
Picture Location drop-down list in the Desktop Background window, as 
shown in Figure B.9.
If you select only one desktop background, that’s one that stays on all 
the time. However, if you select multiple backgrounds, Windows will 
cycle through them, changing the background at the interval you specify. 
To choose multiple images, click to place a mark in the check box in 
the upper-left corner of each image you want. To show them in random 
order, mark the Shuffle check box.
After selecting an image as the background, you must specify how it will 
appear if it is not exactly the same size (that is, the same resolution) as 
the current desktop resolution. Table B.1 summarizes the choices avail-
able. Some of the choices involve a background color behind the image. 
The default is black; if you want a different color, click the Desktop 
Background hyperlink at the bottom of the window (see Figure B.8) to 
open a dialog box from which you can choose some other color.
Step by Step
Applying a Theme
Follow these steps to apply a theme:
	 1.	Right-click the desktop and choose Personalize. The Personalization screen appears (see Figure B.8).
	 2.	Click the desired theme.
	 3.	Close the window.

If the image is smaller than the desktop, the image enlarges to fill the desktop completely. Image 
quality may suffer.
 Fit
The image enlarges or shrinks to match the screen resolution vertically. If the image is not as wide 
as the screen, a solid color appears on the sides of the image. The image’s aspect ratio does not 
change.
 Stretch
The image expands to fill the entire screen, changing its aspect ratio as needed. The image may be 
distorted.
 Tile
If the image is smaller than the desktop, the image repeats itself in any remaining space. This set-
ting sometimes works well for small pictures that can repeat many times onscreen.
 Center
A single copy of the image appears in the center of the desktop, with a solid color filling the remain-
der of the space.
If you don’t want any image at all—just a solid color on the desktop—
then choose Solid Colors from the Picture Location drop-down list and 
choose the desired color.

Selecting a Sound Scheme
As Windows operates, it makes sounds (provided the computer has 
sound support and the speakers aren’t muted). For example, there is 
a Windows log-off sound, an Exit Windows sound, and sounds made 
when windows open and close.
The process of choosing individual sounds to be associated with each 
system event can be tedious, so Windows provides sets of sounds called 
sound schemes. A sound scheme includes a sound clip pre-selected for 
each system event. Some Aero themes include a sound scheme, and some 
use the Windows default sounds or the current sound scheme setting.
sound scheme A set of sounds that are used to 
indicate common events.
Selecting a Screen Saver
Screen savers were necessary in the early days of computing because if 
the same image remained on the screen for a long time there was the 
likelihood of damage to the screen because the static image could end 
up being “burned in” and would always be visible in the background. 
The moving image of the screen saver prevented this from happening. 
Monitor technology has changed now, and screen savers are no longer 
necessary for this purpose. However, the screen saver feature remains in 
Windows, partly because some people enjoy them, and partly because a 
screen saver provides a certain level of privacy by obscuring your screen 
after a certain period of inactivity so that passersby cannot see what you 
were doing when you stepped away from the PC. You can also set the 
screen saver to display the logon screen when the computer wakes up 
from a screen saver operation, providing some extra security.
screen saver A utility that displays a moving 
object or changing pattern on the screen after 
there has been no user interaction for a specified 
amount of time.

message may appear that it has no options you can set. 
Adjust any settings available and click OK.
	 5.	(Optional) Click the Preview button to preview the screen 
saver. Move the mouse or press any key to return.
	 6.	Change the Wait value to the number of minutes you 
want to wait after the computer is idle before the screen 
saver starts.
	 7.	 (Optional) If you want a password to be required when 
waking up from the screen saver, mark the On Resume, 
Display Logon Screen check box.
	 8.	Click OK to close the dialog box.
Saving Your Settings as a New Theme
After making all your desktop appearance selections, you may want to 
save those settings as a new theme so you can quickly reapply the same 
settings later if you temporarily switch to some other theme. When there 
are unsaved changes to the current theme, an Unsaved Theme entry 
appears in the Personalization window in the My Themes area. You can 
save Unsaved Theme as a new theme with a name that you specify.
You can also save the theme in a file that can be shared with other peo-
ple. You might do this if you wanted all the PCs in your home or office 
to have exactly the same settings, for example.

Adjusting Accessibility Features
Accessibility features are utilities and settings that make Windows easier 
for people with disabilities to use. Windows contains a broad array of 
accessibility options that can help people with visual, hearing, and move-
ment impairments.

people with disabilities use Windows more easily.
New Technologies
Controlling a Computer with Your Brain?
People with disabilities who have some movement 
that they can control can operate a computer using 
some form of adaptive input device, such as a joy-
stick, a special keyboard, or a laser pointer mounted 
on the forehead. But what about people who can’t 
control any movements at all? Researchers are 
working on a type of computer input device that uses 
brainwaves for control. People can be trained to use 
thought patterns to fire certain neural pathways in 
the brain voluntarily, and a sensor can pick up that 
pathway activity and use it to control an on-screen 
pointing device. Clinical trials and studies are in prog-
ress now that could improve and refine this technol-
ogy to make it available to everyone who can benefit 
from it. For more information about this technology, 
read the article at http://www.alsa.org/

Changing Location-Based Settings
Location-based settings help you tell Windows where you are and what 
languages you read and write in while you are there. They can help you 
install and switch between display languages, keyboard layouts, and 
regional settings for how dates and times are written, what currency 
symbols are used, and what time it is. In the following sections, you will 
learn how to adjust your computer for the language and location that 
best fit your current situation.
Changing the Display Language
The version of Windows 7 that you use has an interface in a specific 
language. The menus, dialog boxes, error messages, and controls are all 
in that language (most commonly English). This is called the display 
language. If you want Windows 7 to support more than one display 
language, you must install a language pack.
display language The language in which the 
commands and menus in the user interface 
appear.
language pack Add-on software that allows a 
copy of Windows originally written in one language 
to use a different display language.
NOTE
Go to http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/language-packs to learn how to acquire 
and install a language pack. Some language packs require Enterprise or Ultimate editions.
Language packs and language interface packs are not provided for all 
Windows versions. Depending on the language, the pack may be available 
only for systems that run Windows 7 Enterprise or Ultimate editions. If 
you have the Enterprise edition, you must contact your system adminis-
trator to acquire language packs. If you have Ultimate edition, you can 
install language packs through Windows Update by choosing to browse 
and select optional updates. For information about using Windows 
Update, see the section “Installing OS Updates” in Chapter 15. If you 
have any other edition of Windows 7, you cannot use multiple display 
languages unless you upgrade to an edition that supports them.
NOTE
If you have the wrong edition of Windows for the features you want to use, you can easily upgrade to an edi-
tion with more features. Open the Control Panel from the Start menu, click System and Security, and click 
Windows Anytime Upgrade. You will need a credit card to pay for the upgrade.

	 2.	Click the Clock, Language, and Region heading.
	 3.	Click the Region and Language heading. The Region and Language dialog box opens with the Language tab displayed.
	
	 If you do not have a Display Language setting on this tab, you cannot proceed because no language packs are available.
	 4.	Under the Display Language heading, select the desired language.
	 5.	Click OK.
Changing the Keyboard Layout
If you create documents in different languages, you may sometimes 
want to use a different keyboard. You can tell Windows to use a differ-
ent keyboard layout, so that when you press the keys on the keyboard, 
Windows displays the appropriate characters. Changing the keyboard 
layout has no effect on any other regional or language setting.
Keyboard layouts are based on the input language you select. The input 
language is the language in which you input data. It is separate from the 
display language. Each input language has one or more keyboard layouts. 
You might possibly have multiple keyboard layouts for a certain input 
language. For example, there is an alternative English-language keyboard 
layout called Dvorak, named for its inventor.
After enabling the keyboard layouts and input languages 
you want, you can switch between them using keyboard 
shortcuts or using the Language bar. The default key-
board shortcut for switching input languages is Left 
Alt+Shift. The Language bar is a part of Windows 7; it 
appears on the taskbar when multiple input languages are 
installed. It provides a quick pop-up menu from which 
you can select the desired input language, as shown in 
Figure B.14. You can also choose Show the Language Bar 
from the pop-up menu to use a larger, floating version.
keyboard layout The arrangement of the keys

Appendix B: Customizing Windows 7
Changing Regional and Location Settings
When you are working in different parts of the world (or creating docu-
ments designed to be used in different parts of the world), dates, times, 
numbers, and currency may customarily be written in a different format. 
For example, in the USA and most countries in the Middle East, dates 
are written with the month first, then the day, and then the year, like this: 
06/15/2015. However, in most countries in Europe, dates are written 
with the day and month in reverse order, like this: 15/06/2015. And in 
most of Asia, dates are written with the year first, like this: 2015/06/15.
Rather than trying to memorize the appropriate format for each region, 
you can choose a global format in Windows for a particular country, and 
Windows will automatically make the appropriate settings for the cho-
sen country the defaults. When you select a country from the list, all the 
regional settings are automatically set to the defaults for that country, but 
you can fine-tune the settings as desired. For example, you could use the 
date formats for the United States but the currency symbols for the United 
Kingdom.
Windows also has a Location setting that you can use to let Windows 
know where you are physically located at the moment. This setting will 
interact with any software that requests your location to allow it to pro-
vide you with local weather forecasts and other region-specific news.
Step by Step
Changing Regional and Location Settings
To change the setting for your region or location, follow these steps:
	 1.	Click the Start button and click Control Panel.
	 2.	Click the Clock, Language, and Region heading.
	 3.	Under the Region and Language heading, click Change 
the Date, Time, or Number Format. The Region and 
Language dialog box opens with the Formats tab 
displayed.
	 4.	Open the Format drop-down list and select the desired 
country or region. The settings in the dialog box update 
automatically to its defaults.
	 5.	(Optional) Under Date and Time Formats, open any drop-
down list and make a different selection, based on your 
preferences.
	 6.	 (Optional) Click the Additional Settings button to open 
the Customize Formats dialog box. Make any additional 
changes to the settings on the Numbers, Currency, Time, 
and/or Date tabs, and click OK.
	 7.	Click the Location tab in the Region and Language dialog 
box.
	 8.	Open the Current Location drop-down list and select the 
country where you are.
	 9.	Click OK to close the dialog box.
	10.	Close the Control Panel window.

Changing the Date and Time
The current time 
appears in the lower-
right corner of the 
Windows desktop, 
on the taskbar. You 
can click it to pop 
up a calendar that 
shows today’s date 
(see Figure B.15), 
and you can browse 
this calendar to 
look up other dates 
too. The date and 
time are not just for 
your information; 
Windows uses the 
date and time to 
manage files. For 
example, Creation Date is a file property; the current date and time are 
automatically assigned this property for each new file you create. Some 
file searches are also based on dates and times assigned to the files.
Figure B.15  Click the date to pop up a small calendar.
CAUTION
If you set the computer’s clock ahead of the current date, some Windows features that use the clock to deter-
mine when to perform certain activities may be affected. For example, you might see a message that your 
virus definitions are out-of-date.
Windows automatically updates the system date and time using Internet 
time servers whenever an Internet connection is available, so you should 
seldom have to change the clock in Windows due to it being off by a min-
ute or two. It’s possible to change the date and time manually but most 
people do not do it. Windows offers several choices for Internet time 
servers, but you can add a time server of your own choosing if you want.
However, if you travel to a location that’s in a different time zone, you 
will need to let Windows know of your new time zone so that it can 
update the clock automatically for you. The Windows list of time zones 
includes information about Daylight Saving Time (DST) so that it can 
automatically set your clock forward or back as needed on the appropri-
ate days of the year.
Internet time server An online server that 
provides the current date and time to any software 
that asks for it.

655
Appendix B: Customizing Windows 7
Time Not Updating?
If your computer’s time is off in increments of exactly 
one hour, you probably have the time zone set incorrectly 
for your current location. However, if it is off by any other 
increment of time, the computer may be having trouble 
connecting to the time server. Check your Internet con-
nection. If it seems okay, try rebooting the computer. If 
you are still having problems, do the following: Click the 
clock and choose Change Date and Time Settings. Click 
the Internet Time tab and see if there is an error mes-
sage. Click Change Settings to open the Internet Time 
Settings dialog box, and choose a different time server.
Troubleshooting
You can optionally display up to two 
other clocks besides the main clock. 
This might be useful if you frequently 
work with someone who lives in 
another time zone and you want to 
remember what time it is there when 
making phone calls or scheduling 
meetings. When you set up additional 
clocks, they appear on the pop-up 
panel when you click the clock, as 
shown in Figure B.16.
Figure B.16  Additional clocks appear when you click the time in the taskbar.

Appendix B: Customizing Windows 7
Summary
Customizing the Interface
The User Interface (UI) can be customized in a variety of ways. You can change the keyboard’s 
repeat delay, repeat rate, and cursor blink speed. For the mouse, you can customize button con-
figuration, double-click speed, pointers, and movement speed.
The taskbar can be resized and locked, and can be set to auto-hide when not in use. You can 
change the icon size on the taskbar, pin additional shortcuts to it, and move it to another side 
of the screen. You can also customize the notification area’s icons. You can customize the Start 
menu and the taskbar by right-clicking either one and choosing Properties. In the dialog box that 
appears, make settings changes as desired.
The screen resolution determines how small or large text and icons appear onscreen. Different 
resolutions have different aspect ratios. Right-click the desktop and choose Screen Resolution to 
access the settings.
Windows provides themes that customize the desktop’s appearance by applying a background 
image, a window color, and sound setting. Some of the themes use Aero features such as semi-
transparent window borders. Background, color, and sound scheme can also be selected sepa-
rately. You can also set up a screen saver.
Accessibility features help people with disabilities use Windows more easily. Features are avail-
able that help with vision, hearing, and movement disabilities. The Ease of Access Center in the 
Control Panel provides several methods of setting them up.
Changing Location-Based Settings
The display language is the language in which the Windows user interface appears. You can have 
multiple display languages installed and switch between them if you have the right language packs 
and Windows edition installed.
The input language is the language in which you type input. An input language may have one or 
more keyboard layouts that you can switch among. You can change the display and input lan-
guages and the keyboard layouts from the Region and Language dialog box, accessed from the 
Control Panel. You can also choose a region from the Format list in the Region and Language dia-
log box to specify how Windows will handle dates, numbers, and currency symbols. The Current 
Location setting lets Windows know where you are physically located, which may affect certain 
news feeds and custom content.
Windows keeps the date and time current by connecting with Internet time servers automatically. 
You can also manually change the date and time if you like. When you travel between time zones, 
you must let Windows know the new time zone you want to use. If you frequently work in differ-
ent time zones, you can optionally display up to two additional clocks.

More Mouse Settings
There are many more mouse settings you can adjust than were covered in this appendix. Try out 
the following settings and then write a brief explanation of which tab of the Mouse Properties 
dialog box they are located on and what each of them does:
◾	 Click Lock
◾	 Snap To
◾	 Pointer Trails
Adaptive Input Devices
Many people with disabilities who use a computer have special input devices that help them issue 
commands and input data. Pick one of the following topics and research on the Internet what 
products are available and how much they cost. Write a report that details your findings. Include 
photos where applicable. Make sure you document your sources appropriately.
◾	 Adaptive keyboard or other text-entry alternative to a keyboard
◾	 Adaptive mouse or other pointer-movement alternative to a mouse
Think It Over
Screen Resolution
With a high screen resolution you can fit lots of content on the screen at once, but it may be more 
difficult to see because icons and text will be smaller. Windows allows you to adjust the size of 
the text and icons somewhat to help with this, but overall, a higher resolution results in smaller 
onscreen content. Try out several resolutions on your PC, and determine which one is the best for 
your needs. Is it the highest one, or one of the lower resolutions?
Another consideration with resolution is that on LCD monitors, the screen looks the sharpest and 
clearest at the highest (native) resolution. As you tried out different resolutions, did you notice 
that some resolutions appeared fuzzy? This doesn’t happen on a CRT monitor.
