INTRODUCTION
Scams and fraud have been a part of history since the 
dawn of time. Many of the new scams we see today are 
not new at all but just variations on old cons. Schemes 
around in the 1500s and referred to as the Spanish Prisoner 
Scam have morphed over time to become the Nigerian Letter 
Scam of today. Claims of medical charlatans were as attractive to 
the early American colonists as they are to us now. 
Clever con artists can manipulate every human need and desire. 
After all, they are the only criminals known as artists. And as much 
as we rightfully deplore their actions, we must recognize their art 
to better defend ourselves. Scam artists adapt their art to paint 
whatever picture they sense will make us vulnerable to their con. 
They know how to appeal to our own particular weaknesses and 
psychological makeup. They appeal to whatever works. They 
construct a network of “people like us” whom we trust; they trumpet 
legitimate and impressive-sounding business connections; they 
appeal to our fears; they appeal to our friendship; they appeal to 
our optimism; they appeal to our desire for quick and easy solutions 
to life’s problems; and they appeal to our greed. Sometimes they 
even appeal to and exploit that little kernel of dishonesty that many 
people have.
According to the Federal Trade Commission, every year more 
than ten percent of Americans lose more than a billion dollars to 
scams. Interestingly, the largest group of victims is between the 
ages of 25 and 44; ages when you are young enough to know 
everything—which, of course, makes you more vulnerable to a 
scammer. Particularly troublesome is a study by the National 
Association of Securities Dealers which indicates that wealthy people, 
who are ﬁ nancially literate and astute, are actually more likely to be 
suckered in by a ﬁ nancial scam. The only defense against scammers 
is knowledge and skepticism. This book provides you with some of 
both. It teaches you how to recognize and avoid scams.
Being aware of the criminals who are out to take your money is not 
enough. A scam by any other name is still a scam, and unfortunately, 
there are some scams that are perfectly legal that can cause you to 
lose money. Or perhaps they are imperfectly legal, but at this point 

x
in time, the law may not be on your side. A good example of a legal 
scam is what credit card companies can do legally in many instances.
So read this book and gain the knowledge that can 
protect your wallet. This book teaches you the truth about 
scams and how to keep from becoming a victim of both 
illegal and legal scams.

PART I: THE TRUTH ABOUT IDENTITY THEFT
TRUTH
1
Identity theft—your money 
or your life
“You may fool all the people some of the 
time, you can even fool some of the people 
all of the time, but you cannot fool all of the 
people all of the time.”
—Abraham Lincoln
“But you can come awfully close if people 
aren’t careful.”
—Steve Weisman

“We’re number one.” That chant can be heard at many 
sporting events. Being number one generally is a 
position of great prominence. However, when it comes 
to scams, being number one is a dubious distinction. Identity 
theft is and will be for the foreseeable future number one among 
scams. More than a third of all fraud complaints to the Federal 
Trade Commission are for identity theft. In 2006, 14 million 
Americans were victims of identity theft.
Identity theft occurs when 
someone obtains your personal 
information, such as a credit 
card number or a Social Security 
number, and then either uses this 
information to gain access to your 
accounts or uses it to obtain credit 
in your name and run up enormous 
bills that come back as black marks 
on your credit report.
Identity theft is an attractive growth industry in the criminal world. 
It is easy to accomplish and difﬁ cult to catch. It can be done through 
high tech, low tech, or no tech. Identity thieves obtain your personal 
information by sophisticated computer tactics that trick you into 
providing your personal information, or they can obtain it by going 
through your garbage for credit card applications that you have 
thrown in the trash. You may be victimized by organized criminals 
continents away or by members of your own family. Identity theft is 
everywhere.
The damage to your credit report is one of the most harmful 
aspects of identity theft. The information contained in your credit 
report is used by the credit reporting agencies to calculate your 
credit score. The range of credit scores is between 300 and 850. The 
higher your score, the better your credit. Your ability to get a car loan, 
credit card, or a mortgage loan as well as the interest rate for which 
you will be eligible is affected by your credit score. Many people are 
unaware that their credit score affects the interest rate that they will 
be offered on loans or credit cards. Your ability to get a job, obtain 
insurance, or rent an apartment is often dependent upon your credit

third of all fraud 
complaints to 
the Federal Trade 
Commission are for 
identity theft.

score. When you are the victim of identity theft, the misuse of your 
credit by the identity thief can drastically reduce your credit score, 
thereby making your life much more difﬁ cult and expensive. It is a 
complicated, frustrating, and time-consuming task to try to correct 
your credit report after you have been the victim of identity theft. 
Identity theft can be like herpes: You have it for life. Once you have 
been victimized, it can come back to haunt you, even years later.
One of the latest identity theft twists is medical identity theft, or 
the theft of a person’s identity to access his health insurance. The 
effects on the victim can be enormous. In addition to the usual 
damage to your credit for unpaid bills, your medical treatment could 
be based on the identity thief’s medical history. You could receive a 
prescription that harmfully interacts with other prescriptions you take. 
You could even receive a blood transfusion of the wrong blood type. 
Credit records can be difﬁ cult to correct following an identity theft, 
but medical records can be almost impossible to ﬁ x due to medical 
privacy laws.
Medical identity theft is often 
an inside job. An employee of the 
health care provider gives the 
information to identity thieves, 
who in turn sell the information 
to people needing medical care. 
Sometimes, however, medical 
identity theft is an outside job, where the identity thieves go through 
the trash of a health care provider.
Protect yourself from medical identity theft as you would from 
any identity theft by shredding medical bills and records that 
you are discarding. In addition, keep an updated copy of your 
medical records that your physician maintains. Always read any 
communications from your health insurance provider carefully, 
regardless of how difﬁ cult they sometimes are to understand. Ask 
your health insurance provider to give you a list of all 
payments made in your name. If you ﬁ nd any irregularities, 
you can follow up with both your physician and the credit 
reporting bureaus.
Medical records 
can be almost 
impossible to ﬁ x 
due to medical

Go phish

Conmen construct counterfeit websites that appear to 
be those of legitimate companies but, in fact, are just a 
way of hooking you into providing personal information 
that can be mined for identity theft. This scam is called phishing.
Phishing occurs when an identity thief lures you through a phony 
email that purports to be from a bank or other legitimate company 
to a bogus website that looks like the website of the legitimate 
company that the scammers pretend to be. This website requires you 
to provide personal ﬁ nancial information to verify your account or 
even allegedly to protect you from the very type of fraud that you are 
about to become a victim of. One telltale ﬂ aw in phishing schemes 
is that although the website to which you link from the phony email 
appears to be legitimate, if you look closely at the web address, you 
will notice that it is not correct. Unfortunately, many victims do not 
notice that the domain name does not match the site to which they 
have been directed.
One early phishing expedition set 
up a phony America Online website. 
The conmen sent email messages 
to their victims claiming that there 
was a problem with their America 
Online accounts and, if they did not 
update their billing information, 
their AOL accounts would be 
canceled, causing a loss of Internet 
access. The email message directed 
the victims to click on a hyperlink 
contained in the fraudulent email 
to reach the AOL Billing Center. The 
people who did this ended up at a 
website that looked amazingly like 
the real AOL website, but it was a 
phony. The unwary victims were 
then instructed to provide the credit card numbers for the cards they 
used to pay their AOL accounts. They were also asked for a new credit 
card number to replace the one that was alleged to have resulted 
in the original problem with the billing. In one variation of this con, 
the scammer also asked for the customer’s name, mother’s maiden 
One telltale ﬂ aw in 
phishing schemes 
is that although 
the website to 
which you link 
from the phony 
email appears to 
be legitimate, if 
you look closely at 
the web address, 
you will notice that 
it is not correct.

name, billing address, Social Security number, bank routing number, 
and AOL screen names and passwords, a veritable mother load of 
potential identity theft information.
Another phishing expedition involves an email from your bank 
with information to help you avoid identity theft. It tells you that the 
bank can provide you with a special security system that will generate 
online codes with which you can conduct online business without the 
fear that your personal information will be compromised. The email 
goes on to tell you that all you need to do to register for this service is 
to click on the link contained in the email to direct you to the website 
to register for the security system. That is the carrot approach. 
However, the same email also uses the stick approach and informs 
you that if you do not complete the application for the new security 
system, your online access to your bank account will be temporarily 
suspended for security reasons.
The email looks quite authentic. I received such an email and 
might have even been tempted to respond to it had I actually been 
an account holder at the national bank that contacted me about my 
account. Scammers send out waves of emails without knowing who 
is and who is not a customer of the particular bank. It’s a numbers 
game to them that at least some of the people who get the emails 
will indeed be customers of the bank and fall for the scam.
If you click on to the link to which the email directs you, you are 
also in danger of unwittingly downloading a Trojan horse keystroke-
logging program without your being aware of it that can provide 
the scammer with passwords and other important information from 
your computer that can be used to defraud you. Even worse, if you 
go to the website to which you are directed, you will ﬁ nd that you 
are asked, for identiﬁ cation purposes, to provide your user ID and 
password, which in turn gives the scammers all the information they 
need to empty your account at that bank.
TIP You can install many kinds of antiphishing software on your 
computer that will warn you if you are on a known phishing 
site. A good one that is available free is Netcraft, which you can 
download at www.toolbar.netcraft.com.

The truth is, your bank or Internet server will never contact you in 
this manner. If you get an email that purports to be a notice that 
an account of yours will be closed unless you reconﬁ rm your billing 
information, do not follow the prompts to reply or click on any 
hyperlinks contained in the email. Instead, contact the real 
company at a telephone number that you already know to 
be accurate and inquire about your account.

Vishing down on the pharm

10
First came phishing; then came pharming and vishing. 
Perhaps next will come spelling lessons. Pharming and 
vishing are next steps in the evolution of phishing.
Pharming involves a virus or malicious program, sometimes called 
malware, that is secretly installed on your computer, often through 
an attachment to an apparently innocuous email or attached to 
music or other free downloads from sites with which you may not 
be familiar. And that is one of the key lessons. Never download 
from sites with which you are not totally familiar. Just as you would 
instruct your children not to take candy from strangers, you should 
also instruct them never to download music, games, or anything else 
from an unknown source. There is just too much of a risk of malware. 
Once the malware is installed on your computer, you may, in the 
course of your normal computer use, correctly type in the name of 
a bank or other company with which you do business but end up 
being directed to a phony website even though the domain name 
that appears on the address line may indicate the correct, legitimate 
address of the bank or other business you were trying to contact. The 
truth is that the address of the legitimate website has been hijacked 
by the identity thieves, and their malware is now imbedded in your 
computer. Once you arrive at the phony website, if you succumb to 
the requests for personal information on the website, you are on your 
way to becoming a victim of identity theft.
The truth is, you should never click on links within emails from 
people with whom you’re not familiar. Don’t provide personal 
information online to anyone with whom you are not totally familiar. 
And, of course, keep your computer as secure as possible through 
the use of spam ﬁ lters and antivirus and antispyware software 
along with a good ﬁ rewall. It is 
also critical to keep that protective 
software current because scammers 
are constantly improving their 
technology.
Vishing takes advantage of a new 
technological advance for a scam. 
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) 
is a new technology that permits 
Never download 
music, games, 
or anything else 
from an unknown 
source. There is 
just too much of a 
risk of malware.

people to make telephone calls through their computer instead 
of a phone line. If you call a regular telephone number from your 
computer, your voice converts into a digital signal that transmits over 
the Internet and then converts to a regular telephone signal when it 
reaches the regular telephone that you want to call.
People who would be wary of an email message purporting to be 
from their bank or credit card company telling them that their security 
has been breached are more likely to trust a message they receive 
in a telephone call. And that is just what the scammers do in a new 
technique that is known as vishing. A recorded phone message is 
sent out by computers using Voice over Internet Protocol technology 
to vast numbers of potential victims telling them that their bank 
account or credit card security has been breached and that they 
should call the security ofﬁ ce of the bank or credit card company 
immediately. Once the victim calls the number, a prerecorded 
message tells them that for account veriﬁ cation, they need to provide 
their name as well as their bank account number or credit card 
number. When they provide this information, their security actually is 
breached because this is a scam.
The truth is, if you were to receive such a legitimate call regarding 
your bank account or credit card, it would not be through a 
prerecorded message. In addition, 
you should never call the number 
provided to you by an unsolicited 
telephone call. Instead, you should 
go to your monthly bank statement 
or credit card statement and retrieve 
the telephone number for your bank

Do Not Call Registry, 
Patriot Act scams

14
Many scams come about through telemarketing. 
Although legitimate companies use telemarketing, the 
combination of annoyance that many people feel when 
they receive telemarketing calls coupled with the increased risk of 
fraud in a telemarketing call where you receive information that is 
impossible to verify while you are speaking with the telemarketer 
makes many people choose to enroll in the Do Not Call list 
established by the federal government. Enroll by going online to 
www.donotcall.gov or by calling 888-382-1222.
The national Do Not Call Registry set up by Congress permits you 
to enroll as part of a list of people who telemarketers are prohibited 
from calling. It works. However, anything can be turned into another 
opportunity for scammers. Although it may seem somewhat ironic, 
scammers have called people on the telephone telling them that 
they are with the Do Not Call list and they need information to sign 
them up. They then use this information to make you a victim of 
identity theft. Don’t fall for this ploy. The real Do Not Call Registry 
does not call.
Whatever is in the news can be turned into a scam by clever 
scammers—from natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina, to 
antiterrorist legislation such as the Patriot Act. Many people have 
received emails purporting to be from the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation, or FDIC. The email looks legitimate. It’s not. The FDIC will 
never contact you by email. The email you receive from the conman 
tells you that the Director of Homeland Security is suspending all 
deposit insurance on your bank accounts due to possible violations 
of the Patriot Act. The email goes on to urge you to provide personal 
identifying information to revive your FDIC insurance, which you can 
do by clicking on the link in the email. The website you are linked 
to in the email, which purports to be an FDIC website, is a phishing 
expedition run by some not very patriotic conmen. You will be asked 
to provide personal information, including your Social Security 
number. Once the scammer obtains this information, he uses it to 
make you a victim of identity theft. You should ignore any emails 
you receive that say they are from the FDIC. If you are 
concerned that there may be a real problem with your bank 
accounts, call the FDIC at a telephone number you know to 
be accurate.

Protect yourself from 
identity theft

16
Follow these guidelines to protect yourself from 
identity theft:
1. Don’t give out your personal information on the phone to 
someone you have not called.
2. Don’t give your personal information online to anyone you have 
not contacted directly, and be sure that the company with which 
you are dealing is legitimate.
3. Check your credit report annually. It’s free. Go to https://www.
annualcreditreport.com/cra/index.jsp or call 877-322-8228.
4. Don’t carry your Social Security card in your wallet.
5. Don’t use your Social Security number for identiﬁ cation purposes 
unless you’re required to do so by law. Generally, you are not 
required to provide your Social Security number to a business 
unless the company is required to report transactions to the 
Internal Revenue Service. Unfortunately, many businesses ask 
for your Social Security number for their own identiﬁ cation 
purposes, and there are few laws to prevent them from doing so. 
If a company asks for your Social Security number, don’t give it 
immediately. Ask the company to use an alternate number such 
as your driver’s license number. The Government Accountability 
Ofﬁ ce (www.gao.gov) has compiled a list of state laws that limit 
the use of Social Security numbers. You can consult this list to 
learn about the rights you have in your particular home state.
6. It has been against the law since December 17, 2005, for states to 
use your Social Security number as your driver’s license number, 
but many people still have older driver’s licenses that are not yet 
up for renewal that display their Social Security number. Ask for a 
new license without your Social Security number.
7. Take yourself off the list to receive those nuisance preapproved 
credit card offers. Identity thieves retrieve these from the trash 
and apply for credit cards in your name. Call 888-5-OPT-OUT or go 
online to www.optoutprescreen.com to get your name removed 
from the lists used to generate preapproved credit card offers. 
You need to enter your name, phone number, address, and Social 
Security number. You can take yourself off the list for ﬁ ve years or 
permanently. I suggest permanently.

17
8. Change your health insurance card number from your Social 
Security number.
9. Check websites that require personal data. See if the web address 
bar begins with https rather than just http. The “s” means that 
the website is protected by SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) security 
that encrypts your data. Look for a closed padlock image in the 
bottom-right corner. Double-click on the padlock to check that 
the website’s security certiﬁ cate is genuine and up-to-date. The 
padlock indicates that your information is being encrypted.
10. Shred, shred, shred. Cross shredding is best, because some 
methamphetamine addict could stay up all night piecing together 
your vertically shredded trash to get information to be used to 
make you a victim of identity theft.
Credit freeze
You can also opt for a credit freeze. 
You know about the pain people 
experience after eating ice cream 
or drinking a cold beverage too 
quickly. (If you are academically 
inclined, the proper name for 
brain freeze is Spheno Palatine 
Gangleoneuralgia.) However, you 
may not be familiar with credit 
freezes, which can provide you 
with tremendous protection from 
becoming a victim of identity theft.
To evaluate an application for 
credit, particularly for credit to 
buy a large ticket item, such as 
expensive electronic equipment 
or a car, the retailer looks at your 
credit report to determine whether 
you are creditworthy. A credit freeze 
is a lock on your credit report that prevents your credit report from 
being seen by anyone unless you speciﬁ cally, through the use of a 
PIN, make the credit report available. This provides a great deal of

Trojan horse
“Honesty pays, but it doesn’t 
seem to pay enough to suit some 
people.”
—Kin Hubbard

20
Keystroke logging programs, most commonly called 
Trojan horses, are a kind of spyware that, once 
installed on your computer, monitors all activity on your 
computer and transmits that information back to the scammer, 
who uses it to access your bank accounts, credit cards, brokerage 
accounts, or any of your online business. This information can 
even be used to establish credit in your name that the scammer 
will use without, of course, ever paying on the account, which 
then turns up as a black mark on your credit report and makes 
your life more difﬁ cult.
The truth is, Trojan horses are aptly named because they are 
installed in your computer by you when you unwittingly download 
them. A common way they reach your computer is an infected email 
with an attachment that installs the program onto your computer. 
Sharing of songs, games, or other material through peer-to-
peer usage is another way that Trojan horses are stabled in your 
computer. To combat this threat, you must be more than cautious 
when downloading anything. Certainly, don’t download anything 
from a source you’re not entirely familiar with. Even downloading 
attachments from friends or family is no guarantee that your 
computer won’t be infected, because the person may unintentionally 
be passing the Trojan horse on to you. The best course of action is to 
have a good ﬁ rewall and antispyware software on your computer and 
keep the software constantly updated.
TIP  A good ﬁ rewall is an essential element in protecting your 
computer against keystroke logging programs. But not all 
ﬁ rewalls are created equal. Use a ﬁ rewall, such as ZoneAlarm, 
which not only limits access to your computer, but also 
blocks unidentiﬁ ed programs on your computer from sending 
information back to the scammer who planted it, thereby 
minimizing the damage of a Trojan horse on your computer.

PayPal, eBay

22
If you have used eBay, the Internet auction site, you 
have probably used PayPal, which started as an 
independent company to help people pay for goods 
and services online and was bought by eBay in 2002. A phishing 
scam starts with an email claiming to be from PayPal telling 
you that it has had some computer problems and it needs you 
to log on to your account to conﬁ rm your personal information. 
However, the link takes you to a phony PayPal website. If you go 
there and provide the information requested, you soon become a 
victim of identity theft.
Another PayPal scam involves an email that purports to be from 
PayPal informing you that you have received money from someone. 
(In many instances, the name used is Betty Hill, which interestingly 
enough, was the name of a woman who said she was abducted by 
aliens in New Hampshire in 1961.) You are then directed by a link to 
what looks like the ofﬁ cial PayPal site, where you are asked to input 
your PayPal ID and password. If you do so, your PayPal account is 
now in the hands of scammers. If you have any thoughts that such a 
letter might be real, call PayPal.
Another common PayPal scam also starts with a phony email. This 
one conﬁ rms your payment of hundreds of dollars for a particular 
item you actually have not purchased. The email also indicates that 
if you have not authorized the particular charge, you can click on a 
link to cancel the payment and receive a full refund. This takes you to 
an ofﬁ cial-looking website where you are required to input personal 
information, including the number of any credit cards or debit 
cards used for your PayPal account. This is just another example of 
phishing used so that the scammer can get your personal information 
and access your accounts.
When using eBay and other online auctions, check out the refer-
ences of the seller of anything you consider buying. Also, consider 
using an online escrow service. And never provide information to 
PayPal or anyone else online unless you are absolutely positive of 
the identity of the person. Always be skeptical when PayPal 
or anyone else asks for information that they should 
already have.

Second chances—eBay

24
Who doesn’t like a second chance? Who wouldn’t like 
a Mulligan? So when people receive an email telling 
them that they have another chance to bid on an item 
that they had lost out on because the winning eBay bidder failed 
to purchase the item, they are pleasantly surprised. Sometimes 
they are told that the winning bidder did not meet the reserve 
price, which is the minimum price set by the seller for sale of a 
particular item. What scammers do is wait until the end of an 
online auction and then look at the list of bidders and compose 
an email to losing bidders posing as the seller.
The phony email looks legitimate. However, it asks for personal 
information to process the bid and receive an invoice from eBay. 
Unfortunately, once the victim provides his or her personal 
information, the invoice never comes. It is a scam that provides 
identity thieves important information about you. Another variation of 
this scam involves your being permitted to rebid on an item and then 
being instructed to send in your winning bid by a wire transfer. Once 
you send in your money by wire, the money is gone, but the item 
never comes.
The truth is, although second chances do sometimes come in life 
and even in eBay, they do not come through emails directly from 
the seller of the item, but rather from eBay itself. Sometimes the 
authentic second chance offer will come in an email from eBay with 
a “buy it now” icon you can click on to accept the offer. The email will 
also provide you with a new number and page for the item.
Legitimate second chance offers also may appear as a link on the 
page of the particular listing. Below the message “You were outbid” 
will appear any second chance opportunities. Second chance offers 
will also appear on your “Items I Didn’t Win” page on eBay.
 The truth is, you should never consider emails for second chance 
offers that purport to be from the seller personally rather than from 
eBay. Never pay by a wire transfer, such as from Western Union or 
by a bank electronic transfer. If there is a problem with the item, you 
have no recourse to get your money back if you have wired 
it. Finally, ignore messages that do not come to your eBay 
email account but rather turn up in your regular email.

Free adult entertainment

26
Pornography abounds on the Internet. Fully aware of 
the public’s apparent never-ending appetite for online 
adult entertainment, enterprising scammers have used 
this to scam people out of money through their phone bills.
A number of websites, such as the now shut-down sexygirls.com, 
were used in one particular scam to lure people by providing free 
Internet pornography that could be accessed only after downloading 
what was referred to as a special “viewer” program. However, what 
the downloaded program actually did was disconnect the computer 
users from their local Internet service providers and reconnect the 
computers to a phone number in Moldova, an Eastern European 
country found between Romania and the Ukraine. Consequently, 
when the unwary computer user went to the adult entertainment 
websites promoted by the scammers, he incurred international 
telephone charges of more than $2 per minute. To make matters 
worse, the program did not disconnect the computer user from the 
international call until the computer was turned off. Thus, even after 
the computer user left the particular adult entertainment website to 
do other online surﬁ ng, or even when the computer user was not on 
the Internet but merely using his computer for other purposes, such as 
word processing, the international call and the commensurate charges 
continued to accumulate so long as the computer was not turned 
off. The special “viewer” program also automatically turned off the 
computer user’s modem speakers so that the computer user would 
not hear the disconnect or the dialing of the international number.
The lesson here is one not 
restricted to these particular 
pornographic websites. Do not 
download anything from a website 
you’re not familiar with and not 
conﬁ dent as to its legitimacy. In 
some instances, downloaded 
material may even contain Trojan 
horse, keystroke logging programs 
that can follow all your online activities and steal your 
passwords and personal information used online. This 
information, in turn, can be used to make you an identity 
theft victim.

If you can’t trust Oprah
Oprah Winfrey is one of the most popular and 
trustworthy people in America today. So, if you got an 
email from Oprah, certainly you could believe that what she said 
was the truth—and the information contained within that email 
probably would be information you could rely on.
Unfortunately, for the many people who received an emailed 
invitation from Oprah to attend a taping of her show, the email they 
received was not from Oprah but from an identity thief. By the way, 
Oprah herself has been a victim of identity theft. It can happen to 
anyone. In the unsolicited email purporting to be from Oprah, the 
recipients were told that they would receive tickets to her show 
after they either veriﬁ ed ﬁ nancial information or wired money to a 
supplied address. As with all television shows, the Oprah Winfrey 
Show does not sell tickets. They are free. And there would be no 
reason for Oprah to have anyone’s ﬁ nancial information. As always, 
the cardinal rule is: Never give your ﬁ nancial information to someone 
whom you have not contacted directly and whom you have not 
checked out for legitimacy.
From Russia, but not with love—the hit 
man scam
Imagine how you would feel if you opened an email and found that it 
was a communication from a hit man saying that he has been hired 
to kill you by a “friend” of yours. Apparently, the hit man remembers 
the quote of Eddie Cantor, “He hasn’t an enemy in the world—but all 
his friends hate him.” Fortunately, however, the hit man goes on to 
tell you that after following you for some time, he has decided that 
if you pay him a sum, typically ranging from $80,000 to $150,000, 
he will let you live. The FBI has tracked a number of these emails to 
Russia. They are a total scam. There is no hit man. The goal of the 
people behind this particular scam is to either get you to part with 
your money or induce you to provide them with personal information 
that can be used for identity theft. Either way, you lose. If you 
receive such an email, many of which have come from 
1wayout@myway.com, report it to the FBI and the Internet

Ponzi scheme
“The sure way to be cheated is to think 
one’s self more cunning than others.”
—Francois De La Rochefoucauld

30
If scammers had a national holiday, it would be 
March 3—it was on March 3, 1882, that Charles Ponzi 
was born. Ponzi was the early scammer who conned 
Bostonians through a scam that is still with us today and has 
come to be known as a Ponzi scheme—a scam ﬂ exible enough 
to adapt to changes in society and simple enough to stand the 
test of time. It is also effective enough to have cheated people for 
almost a hundred years with no sign of slowing down.
In essence, the Ponzi scheme is the classic pyramid scam—an 
investment advisor claims to be getting really good returns on your 
money when, in fact, he or she is merely taking money from newer 
investors to pay the early investors outlandish interest rates so that 
they generate the word of mouth needed to get the next wave of 
investors. It is a house of cards destined to collapse, usually with the 
originator long gone by the time most of the victims try and fail to get 
the money back.
During the early 1900s, postal 
reply coupons were used to 
permit someone sending mail to 
a person in a foreign country to 
furnish means for a reply instead 
of requiring the recipient of the 
letter to pay for return postage. 
An American businessman, for 
example, could send a contract 
to his or her counterpart in the United Kingdom along with a postal 
reply coupon to cover the cost of sending the contract back to 
America.
Through what appeared to be a rather complicated transaction 
similar to currency trading today, Ponzi purported to convert his 
American dollars into currencies in other countries with favorable 
exchange rates and purchase postal reply coupons in those countries 
at a proﬁ t. To ﬁ nance this project on a large scale, Ponzi sought out 
investors, promising them a 50 percent return on their investment 
in only 45 days. Initial investors were paid off handsomely, and the 
word got out that this man was a ﬁ nancial wizard. More and more 
people invested. At the height of his scheme, investors poured 
money into Ponzi’s scheme at a rate of $250,000 a day.
The simple scam 
of paying off 
early investors 
with the money 
of later investors 
continues to this 
day.

31
Unfortunately for Ponzi, his success was not long lived. 
Investigative reporters, along with state and federal ofﬁ cials, were 
looking into Ponzi’s investment company. Perhaps the most telling 
piece of information came out in a newspaper article published 
in the Boston Post that said the number of postal reply coupons 
equal to the money invested in the scheme would have had to be 
160,000,000 coupons, whereas the total number of postal reply 
coupons in the world was only 27,000. Soon thereafter, Ponzi’s 
empire crumbled, and eventually he pleaded guilty to mail fraud and 
was sent to prison.
Finally, the truth of Ponzi’s scheme became clear. He would take 
the investment money of later investors to pay the promised returns 
to earlier investors. This, in turn, would lure more and more investors 
to him. However, his scheme was ultimately doomed to failure by 
simple mathematics, because there just were not enough people to 
keep this scheme or any such scheme going forever.
Ponzi had made one great mistake. A good conman knows when to 
leave. Ponzi did not. His greed kept him in Boston right up until the 
time of his arrest. Charles Ponzi’s short reign as the king of the scams 
was over, but like the events around Boston in 1776, Ponzi’s scam 
was the scam heard ’round the world. His scheme has been repeated 
with just slight variations for nearly 
100 years. The form of investment 
changes from time to time, but the 
simple scam of paying off early 
investors with the money of later 
investors continues to this day.
Our teachers used to implore us 
to do our homework, and nowhere 
is that more important than in evaluating investment opportunities. 
The truth is, if it sounds too good to be true, it usually is. View 
promises of outlandish returns on investments with great skepticism. 
Don’t let greed make you less vigilant. As Charles Ponzi’s later 
investors learned, just because earlier investors saw great 
proﬁ ts does not mean that you will see proﬁ ts or even a 
return of your initial investment.

Chain letters

34
Aretha Franklin was right when she sang the song 
“Chain of Fools,” because anyone who gets involved 
with a chain letter is a fool. Like many scams, chain 
letters have been around for a long time. People have been losing 
money to chain letters since 1888. The scam is tweaked now and 
then to look a bit different or even to make it appear legal, but 
the bottom line is that a chain letter is not a love letter, and it is 
never legal.
At its essence, a chain letter involves a letter that you receive 
containing a list of people, commonly ﬁ ve. You are asked to send a 
certain sum of money to the ﬁ rst person on the list, take her name 
off of the list, add your name as the last numbered person on the list, 
and send the list to ﬁ ve more people with the same instructions.
The attraction of chain letters is easy to understand. It is simple to 
do and promises enormous wealth for little effort. The problem is not 
just that it is illegal, but that it is doomed to fail.
Let’s start by looking at the 
math—something I have been 
loathe to do since junior high 
school days, but something that 
begrudgingly I must admit comes 
in handy sometimes. If every one of 
the typically ﬁ ve people appearing 
on a chain letter had followed the 
instructions and sent the letter 
to ﬁ ve of their friends (not that a 
true friend would ever involve you 
in a chain letter), by the time you 
receive it, the chain letter would 
have had to sustain itself through 
3,905 people or links on the chain. 
And that is assuming that the chain 
began with the person who is listed 
ﬁ rst on the chain letter that you receive. If everyone had followed the 
instructions precisely and a person who had just been just bumped 
from the list initiated the chain, the number of people involved in 
the chain letter rises to 19,530. And that begins to tell you why chain 
letters are illegal. Chain letters are a pyramid scheme that will fail as

we run out of people on the planet. It is impossible for a chain letter 
ever to fulﬁ ll its promise to everyone participating.
Those ethically challenged people who do not care that eventually 
the chain letter must fail as long as they receive signiﬁ cant money 
in the early stages of the letter should consider the real possibility 
that people receiving the chain letter will not follow the instructions 
exactly but will insert their name at the top of the list rather than at 
the bottom. They also might even change all the names on the list 
so that they are just aliases of themselves, thus putting themselves 
on the list in ﬁ ve different ways. Either way, you do not move up the 
list, and you do not get money. Or perhaps the people to whom you 
send the chain letter follow the instructions exactly with one notable 
exception: They do not send money. No matter how you look at it, 
Aretha was right: Chain letters are for fools.
In one famous incident, the Federal Trade Commission sent out 
its own mass mailing to 2,000 people who had participated in 
an Internet chain letter that promised participants a minimum of 
$46,000 in 90 days if they did not break the chain. The FTC letter 
warned participants in the letter that chain letters that involve money 
are illegal. Even if you did not originate the chain letter, but merely 
participated, you have violated the law. The chain letter that caught 
the attention of the FTC was pretty much the standard chain letter. 
However, what made it somewhat unique was an attempt to make it 
appear to be legal through a provision that the money contributed 
to the chain letter participants was in return for something of value. 
Interestingly enough, in this case, the something of value was 
instructions on how to start your own chain letter over the Internet.
It is important to remember that chain letters are always illegal. 
As was the situation with the chain letter that prompted the mass 
mailing by the Federal Trade Commission to known participants, 
sometimes chain letters will be disguised to resemble a legitimate 
business proposition by selling you some inexpensive item, but the 
essence of any chain letter is the 
pyramid scheme that drives it. It 
does not take the proverbial rocket 
scientist to see the characteristics of 
a chain letter even when disguised 
as a business.

A couple of the basics

38
Pyramid schemes
Pyramid schemes have probably been with us since 
the pyramids in Egypt were being built. This particular 
scam gets its name from an image of the scam, with the originator 
of the scam at the apex of the pyramid and an ever-increasing
number of participants (and ultimately victims) fanning out from 
the top. For example, if one person who recruited ten people to 
pay him started the pyramid, and each of the ten recruits in turn 
recruited ten more people to pay them, after eleven rounds, the 
number of people required to sustain the pyramid would exceed 
the Earth’s population. And therein lies the scam. Ultimately, the 
pyramid must fall, and people will lose their money.
At its essence, a pyramid scheme is a fraudulent, unsustainable 
business model in which people receive money through enrolling 
new people in the scheme who, in turn, receive money from enrolling 
more people in the scheme. No ﬁ nancially equivalent product 
or service is received for the enrollment fees, the only return on 
“investment” comes from bringing more people into the scheme. 
Chain letters are a form of a pyramid scheme.
As with chain letters, pyramid schemes prey upon people’s greed 
and a desire for easy money, common human traits that invite 
scammers. As with chain letters, pyramid schemes have managed 
to evolve in a manner that even Charles Darwin would have found 
amazing as they change the terminology and the format to make 
them appear legal. Sometimes 
they are called investment clubs or 
gifting networks, but it is easy to see 
that they are pyramid schemes. One 
recent version of a pyramid scheme 
involved a “gifting club” in which 
people made cash “gifts” to higher 
ranking members of the club with 
the promise that as they recruited 
new members to the club, they 
would rise through the ranks of the 
club until they reached a position 
where they themselves would be 
receiving substantial “gifts” from

newer members of the club. The truth is, pyramid schemes are always 
an illegal and losing proposition.
One complicating factor with pyramid schemes is their close 
resemblance to multilevel marketing practices. We are all familiar 
with multilevel marketing companies such as Mary Kay Cosmetics, 
Tupperware, Amway, and Avon, which use a network of independent 
distributors to sell various consumer products. In multilevel 
marketing, you can obtain income from the efforts of members of 
your sales team who, in turn, can have their own sales teams from 
which they obtain income. However, money is not earned merely by 
recruiting new people to the company. A simple way to distinguish a 
legitimate multilevel marketing company from a disguised pyramid 
scheme is that with a pyramid scheme, actual sales of products, if 
any, are small. The money is made from signing up new members 
regardless of the amount of product sold. Generally, the fees to 
become involved in a legitimate multilevel marketing company 
enterprise are small, whereas the fees involved with joining a 
pyramid scheme may be substantial. Another key way to distinguish 
between legitimate multilevel marketing companies is that legitimate 
companies that require you to purchase inventory generally buy back 
unsold inventory if you leave the business. Pyramid schemes will not.
Pyramid scheme scammers are clever. They never call their con 
a pyramid scheme because they understand that we all know that 
those are illegal. Instead, they may go under the name of investment 
clubs or gift clubs. Often, they will even have a completely worthless 
letter supposedly issued by the IRS 
or a legal opinion from a law ﬁ rm 
or even the FTC indicating that this 
particular club is legal and not a 
pyramid scheme. The truth is, these 
supporting pieces of documentation 
are just another piece of the fraud.
Bait and switch
A bait and switch scam occurs when you are lured by advertising 
to purchase a particular product but then steered toward buying a 
different, usually more expensive product. This scam at one time 
or another has victimized almost everyone, which is why federal 
regulations prohibit the practice.

The fact is, bait and switch remains one of the slimier forms of 
deception. Show you a beautiful car, and sell you a more expensive 
car—which the seller convinces you will better meet your needs. The 
truth is, you should be wary any time a vendor brings you in with an 
advertisement to purchase a particular product but then discourages 
you from buying that particular product, instead urging you to buy 
another “better” product. Even if ultimately, before purchase, you are 
told the facts regarding the products, the mere attracting 
you to the seller through this deceptive form of advertising 
is illegal.

Nigerian scam

42
A staple of the Internet and omnipresent in everyone’s 
email is the Nigerian scam. Although it has many 
variations, a common version of it is an unsolicited 
email that you receive from someone in Nigeria who tells you 
that the sender needs to transfer large amounts of money out of 
Nigeria and needs your help.
Although this scam is now commenced primarily through email, 
the scam itself is an oldie that dates back to 1588 when it was known 
as the “Spanish Prisoner con.” In those days, a letter was sent to the 
victim purportedly from someone on behalf of a wealthy aristocrat 
who was imprisoned in Spain under a false name. The identity of the 
nobleman was not revealed for security reasons, but the victim was 
asked to help raise money to obtain the release of the aristocrat, 
who, it was promised, would reward the money-contributing victim 
with great sums of money and, in some versions of the con, the 
Spanish prisoner’s beautiful daughter in marriage.
In its most recent incarnation, you are promised great sums of 
money if you assist a Nigerian in his effort to transfer money out of 
his country. Variations include the movement of embezzled funds by 
corrupt ofﬁ cials, a dying gentleman who wants to make charitable 
gifts, or a minor bank ofﬁ cial who is trying to move the money of 
deceased foreigners out of his bank without the government taking 
it. One popular variation of the scam involves an email from a lawyer 
informing you that there was a plane crash in Nigeria in which a 
wealthy person died. The lawyer represents the estate of the plane 
crash victim, who, you are told, has the same surname as you. Due 
to complicated Nigerian law, the 
millions contained in the estate will 
revert to the government unless it 
can be transferred to you as an heir. 
For your trouble, you are promised 
millions of dollars, with the 
remaining money to go to charity. 
However, you soon learn that you 
need to send money to the lawyer 
for various fees, bribes, insurance, 
and other costs before you get your 
inheritance that never comes.
The essence of 
the Nigerian scam 
is a promise of a 
huge reward for 
payments that you 
make in advance of 
the ultimate payout. 
But the payout 
never comes.

43
The essence of the Nigerian scam is a promise of a huge reward for 
payments that you make in advance of the ultimate payout. But the 
payout never comes.
Many of us would immediately look at such an email with a 
chuckle, secure in the belief that such a proposal must be a scam. 
But thousands of people have fallen for this con. Some, who make 
the mistake of thinking that they are smarter than the scammers, try 
to do their own “due diligence” and ﬁ nd what appear to be actual 
places of business and even apparent contacts at government 
ofﬁ ces. On the surface, which is what the scammers are counting 
on, the ridiculous scam looks like it might even be legitimate. It 
never is. Once the victim has initially agreed to take part in this 
mutual effort to move funds, often after receiving what appear to 
be ofﬁ cial documents, the victim ﬁ nds that the deal is not as simple 
as it originally appeared. Complications arise. Government or bank 
ofﬁ cials need to be bribed. Lawyers need to be paid. The victim is 
asked to contribute money, often as a loan to the enterprise. You 
can guess what happens next. The victim sends money to advance 
what he or she thinks is a big payout but ﬁ nds that the only payout 
involves the funds sent to the scammers. After they have received 
the victim’s money, the scammers suddenly stop communicating and 
vanish. However, in some instances, 
adding insult to injury, once the 
well has gone dry and the victim 
has stopped sending money, the 
scammers use the information they 
have obtained about the victim 
during the con to victimize them a 
second time through identity theft.
One thing to look for immediately 
is the email address of the 
person sending you the initial 
communication. Although they 
often purport to be associated 
with a bank, the email address will not be that of a bank, 
but rather a private email address. But the best course of 
action is to just ignore an email that you know in your heart 
is a scam.

Travel fraud
Like many other scams, travel fraud often starts with 
your being notiﬁ ed that you have won a contest that 
you never entered. This time the prize is a terriﬁ c vacation trip.
You may learn of your winning through a telemarketer, an email, a 
fax, or a postcard. The “free” trip that you have won usually comes 
with fees that are barely visible in the ﬁ ne print. Hidden charges, 
conditions, and additional fees that you must pay to get the free trip 
can add up quickly. Often, you are asked for your credit card number 
or bank account information, sometimes just for identiﬁ cation 
purposes; however, the identiﬁ cation purpose is just to identify 
you as a sucker. Other times, you are required to pay a good faith 
deposit for your free trip that you lose when it becomes impossible to 
schedule your trip.
Another vacation travel scam is an offer that you receive, often by 
fax, that has a too-good-to-be-true price for a great vacation. And it 
is indeed too good to be true. Generally, the hotel accommodations 
are pretty bad, and it may cost you dearly to upgrade. In addition, 
scheduling the vacation for the 
time you wish may carry extra fees. 
Remember, you get what you 
pay for.
Charity scams
Particularly around holiday time or when there’s been a tragic storm 
(a tsunami or Katrina), scammers take advantage of our charitable 
nature and solicit by mail, in person, and on the phone for phony 
charities. Often the names of the phony charity may be amazingly 
similar to a legitimate charity, but the money that you give to this 
“charity” does not end up advancing legitimate charitable activities 
but merely ﬁ nds its way to the pockets of clever scammers. An 
independent problem that arises even when you make a contribution 
to a so-called “legitimate” charity is when that charity takes most 
of your donation and spends it “administratively” or on more fund 
raising efforts rather than applying the money directly to charitable 
actions. Always check out the charity to which you give to determine 
not just if it is legitimate but also how much of what the charity 
receives actually is applied to charitable works. Go to the website 
You get what you 
pay for.

47
www.nasconet.org to get a link to the regulators of charities in your 
particular state. You can also get ﬁ nancial information on speciﬁ c 
charities at GuideStar at www.guidestar.org, the Better Business 
Bureau’s Wise Giving Alliance at www.give.org, the American Institute 
of Philanthropy at www.charitywatch.org, or Charity Navigator at 
www.charitynavigator.org.
It’s common for charities to hire professional fund-raisers to 
manage their fund-raising. There is nothing illegal or improper about 
this practice. But you may want to ask if the person contacting you is 
a professional fund-raiser and what percentage of your donation the 
fund-raiser will keep. If you are uncomfortable with this arrangement, 
you may want to send your check (never send cash) directly to 
the charity to ensure that the charity gets the full beneﬁ t of your 
donation. If the charitable solicitor offers to send a courier or an 
overnight delivery service to pick up your donation, beware! That is 
characteristic of a scam.
If you are contacted on the phone by a charity, play it safe and 
ask the charity to send you written material for you to evaluate the 
particular charity. Even if you have registered on the national Do Not 
Call list to avoid telemarketing calls, the law still permits you to be 
solicited on the phone by charities directly. However, as with any 
telemarketing call, the truth is, you have no way of knowing on the 
phone if the person you are speaking to is legitimate or a scammer. 
Play it safe, and never give out personal information or your credit 
card number to anyone who calls you on the phone.
You should be aware that when it comes to donations to charitable 
organizations, “tax exempt” and “tax deductible” are not the same 
thing. A “charitable” organization may be tax exempt and not be 
required to pay income taxes. However, your payment to such an 
organization is not automatically “tax deductible” as a charitable 
gift on your income tax return. Just because an organization is 
non-proﬁ t and, therefore, tax exempt does not mean that your gift 
is tax deductible to you. Only gifts to charitable organizations that 
receive their tax exemption through section 501(c)(3) of the Internal 
Revenue Code are tax deductible. You can conﬁ rm that the charity 
you contribute to is one to which gifts are tax deductible by going to 
the IRS website at www.irs.gov/charities.

Staged auto accidents
You get cut off in trafﬁ c by a car that suddenly stops, and although 
you slam on your brakes, you rear-end the car that just cut you off. 
You attempt to merge into a line of trafﬁ c and are waved in by a 
helpful driver whose car you collide into when he then doesn’t let you 
into the lane. You are driving close to (or perhaps slightly over) your 
lane line when you get side swiped by another car. You are going 
through an intersection when another car coming from a different 
direction hits your car. Not all automobile accidents are accidents. 
Sometimes they are staged as a way of defrauding insurance 
companies or you. In each of the previously described scenarios, the 
scammers will have phony victims and phony witnesses to bolster 
their stories that the accident was your fault. Sometimes they may 
suddenly turn into your best friend 
and be willing to just settle with 
you for cash rather than involve the 
insurance companies. This may even 
seem like a good offer because it 
avoids insurance complications 
(see www.fbi.gov/page2/feb05/
stagedauto021805.htm).
The truth is, this settlement is not 
a good offer. It is a scam. If you are 
involved in an automobile accident, 
call the police. When you exchange 
license and registration information, 
be mindful not to provide more 
information than required that can 
be used for identity theft purposes. 
Report all accidents to your insurance company and do not pay a 
cash settlement at the scene. Get the license and registration of the 
other driver and take down the pertinent information. Do not merely 
accept his offer to you of this information written down on 
a piece of paper. Make sure you see the actual license and 
registration.

More reasons to be wary

Lost pets
Emotion, fear, and concern are allies of scammers, and 
all three elements are present when a pet owner has 
lost a beloved pet.
Taking advantage of this situation, scammers who notice ﬂ iers put 
up by owners of missing pets or who read online postings of missing 
pets contact the owners and tell them that they have found their 
wandering pet and will be happy to ship the pet back to the owner 
as soon as the owner sends sufﬁ cient money to cover the shipping 
costs. Often there will be a follow-up communication that looks 
like it is from a legitimate shipping company conﬁ rming the initial 
communication.
The truth is, it is a scam. If you are contacted as a potential victim, 
ask for a picture of your pet to be sent. You can say that you merely 
want to conﬁ rm that it is your pet. Or if it is a parrot, you can ask to 
speak to the bird.
The old gray mare—the gray market
The old gray mare just ain’t what she used to be—and often, neither 
are products that you may buy on the gray market. Everyone is aware 
of the term black market, which refers to items that have been stolen 
and then resold, sometimes to unwary consumers and other times to 
consumers who know full well that they are buying stolen goods but 
do not seem to be particularly bothered by this fact.
Goods such as electronic equipment sold throughout the world sell 
at different prices based on differences in currency valuations as well 
as market conditions in the particular country. Entrepreneurs, looking 
to make a buck and take advantage of these ﬂ uctuations in prices 
worldwide, buy up large quantities of goods such as cameras or 
electronic equipment and then sell the items online here in America. 
It has been estimated by the Alliance for Gray Market and Counterfeit 
Abatement that about 40 billion dollars’ worth of technological 
products are sold on the gray market annually throughout the world.
One problem with items purchased on the gray market is that often 
the manufacturers of the products do not honor warranties on gray 
market products. In fact, some manufacturers will not even service 
these unauthorized imported goods not sold by an authorized retailer. 
Whether it is on eBay or other online auction sites, gray market goods 

51
often are readily available online. However, when you buy gray market 
goods from a seller with whom you are not familiar, not only can you 
not be sure that any manufacturer’s warranty will be honored, but 
also sometimes, less than honest merchants even substitute cheap 
components for more expensive parts of the item you purchase.
So, how do you protect yourself and feel conﬁ dent that the deal 
you are getting is good but not too good? Make sure the item comes 
with a full warranty. This is particularly important with electronic 
equipment and cameras. Get a serial number and check with the 
manufacturer to conﬁ rm that it is indeed under warranty. The seller 
may insist that the product is covered by a warranty, and maybe it 
is, but you can never be sure when you are not dealing directly with 
the manufacturer that the warranty offered is legitimate and will be 
honored. Make sure there are no hidden fees that jack up the price 
for expensive parts that should be included with the product, and 
make sure that you know who you are dealing with.*
Hotel scam
People have come to expect things to go wrong. It is Murphy’s Law 
that whatever can go wrong will go wrong. There is even a common 
expression that tells us that “Fecal matter happens,” although not 
precisely in those words. And that is why people are so susceptible 
to the scam in which, as a hotel guest, you get a call to your room 
from the front desk or the manager that there is a problem with the 
credit card you used when you checked into the hotel. You are asked 
to verify your credit card number over the phone, which unfortunately 
some people do. Shortly thereafter, charges are made to your credit 
card that you never authorized.
The truth is, the caller is not the manager or anyone else from 
the hotel. The call is from a scammer. The ﬁ rst thing to remember 
is that no hotel employee will ever ask you for your credit card over 
the phone. If, somehow, there were a problem with your credit card, 
you would be asked to come to the front desk. The rule in a hotel is 
the same as the rule anywhere: Never give out personal information 
of any kind to anyone whom you have not called unless you have 
veriﬁ ed whom you are speaking to. In a hotel, you should call the 
manager of the hotel directly.

Adoption scam
A sad fact is that when people are the most vulnerable and trusting, 
they are more likely to become a victim of a scam. So it should come 
as no surprise that people seeking to adopt a child have been a 
common target of scammers.
There are many different scams involving adoptions that never 
are completed but where the prospective adoptive parents lose 
considerable money to scammers arranging these phony adoptions. 
Many adoption scams originate online, where it is cheap and easy to 
establish a website and a presence at little cost that appears to be 
legitimate but, in fact, is not. Sometimes the scammer promises, for a 
fee, to bring together birth mothers willing to put their children up for 
adoption with adoptive parents. In many instances, there are no birth 
mothers; in other instances, these birth mothers promise their babies 
to multiple adoptive parents. Many of the phony adoptions involve 
babies born in foreign countries. This scam plays on an additional 
vulnerability of people wanting to adopt—namely, that they are 
unfamiliar with the laws of these foreign countries.
The truth is, adoption is a complicated matter. You should deal 
only with agencies that are licensed in your state. In addition, you 
should not take for granted a license document or license number 
provided to you by the adoption agency. Check with your state’s 
adoption regulatory agency. You should also not rely on the Internet 
as your sole resource for adoption information and assistance. Meet 
the person offering to help you at his or her ofﬁ ce to see for yourself 
if there even is an ofﬁ ce. Surrogate parent adoptions are particularly 
complicated and fertile ground for scams. You should never consider 
a surrogate parent adoption without being represented by a lawyer 
familiar with this complicated and evolving area of the law. For 
international adoptions, check with the State Department about the 
regulations for adoption in the country where you are considering 
adopting. The State Department’s Ofﬁ ce of Children’s Issues in the 
Bureau of Consular Affairs has many helpful brochures that 
deal with foreign adoptions. Finally, hire a lawyer to assist 
you. International adoptions are intricate and complicated.

Afﬁ nity fraud
We tend to trust people who are just like us. That is 
a truism. With a knowledge of psychology that would 
make Sigmund Freud envious, conmen use that trust to their 
advantage. Scammers know that once they have a potential 
victim’s heart and trust, their wallets soon follow.
We are experiencing an epidemic of fraud that targets particular 
nationalities, ethnic groups, racial groups, fraternal organizations, 
and religious groups. Religion-related scams are particularly 
common. A scam artist may join a particular church, synagogue, or 
mosque and gain the trust and conﬁ dence of the congregants or 
even the religious leader of the congregation by making a signiﬁ cant 
contribution to the religious organization. But this is just seed money. 
Scammers often target members of a religious, ethnic, fraternal, 
or other group that they appear to belong to and offer “special” 
investment opportunities that ultimately turn out to be worthless. 
Often, to sweeten the pot, particularly in a religious afﬁ nity group 
scam, the scammer tells the charitably inclined victims that a portion 
of the proﬁ ts of his investment program will be used for a charitable 
purpose near and dear to the hearts of the victims. Sometimes the 
fraud is organized as a Ponzi deal so that people in your church, 
synagogue, social organization, or community group become the 
unwitting accomplices of the scam 
artist who ends up making the 
initial victims of the scams his best 
salespeople as they recommend 
the particular investment that has, 
at least initially, worked so well for 
them.
The truth is, you should never 
trust anyone who asks you to 
trust him. Trust me. Always do 
your homework before you invest 
your money. The endorsement of 
someone you know and trust is no 
substitute for real research into any 
investment.

Psychics
Letters, emails, or telephone calls from psychics either offering good 
fortune or the ending of bad fortune are common scams. The positive 
psychic scam occurs when the psychic promises to share a secret 
with you that will bring you fame and fortune. Often the psychic 
offers to sell you a special good luck charm that is guaranteed to 
make good fortune smile upon you. Sometimes this particular scam 
is coupled with a lottery scam by which, shortly after purchasing the 
requisite good luck charm, you receive a notice that you have just 
won a lottery. Unfortunately, this is just another scam in which you 
are required to send an advance payment to receive your lottery 
winnings. Paying for a worthless good luck charm and then sending 
in money to claim a nonexistent prize is a double whammy. The nega-
tive psychic scam occurs when you are told that you are in danger 
from a demonic force and that if you do not send money to the 
psychic to ward off this force, something terrible will happen to you.
The truth is, if you want to believe in psychics, it’s your business, 
but when you receive an unsolicited email or letter from someone 
claiming to be a psychic, I predict it is just a scam.
One last word on psychics. Many people remember the Psychic 
Friends Network, which was a service by which you could talk with 
a psychic on the telephone for $3.99 per minute. At the height of 
its popularity, the Psychic Friends 
Network professed to have more 
than 2,000 psychics available to 
take your call. The service was 
advertised extensively in television 
infomercials during the early 1990s, 
many of which were hosted by 
singer Dionne Warwick. After it 
raked in more than $100,000,000 
dollars of proﬁ ts, the company 
landed in bankruptcy in 1998 due to 
a combination of bad management 
and competition from other psychic 
services. I wonder if any of the 
psychics saw it coming.

Voter registration fraud
The Bible says that to everything there is a season. Scammers also 
are aware of seasons when it comes to fresh opportunities for 
scamming you. During hurricane season, you can expect to be hit for 
a charitable contribution to victims of particular storms by scammers 
pretending to be legitimate charities. During Super Bowl season, 
scams offering phony Super Bowl tickets and travel packages are 
common. And during election years, you may expect to get a call from 
a scammer pretending to be from either your local voter registration 
board or a civic organization offering to either help you register to 
vote or to conﬁ rm your status as an enrolled voter. After the initial 
pitch, the scammer asks you for information to conﬁ rm your identity, 
such as your Social Security number. Some scammers are even so 
audacious as to ask for a credit card number.
The truth is, this is a scam. The 
information is being gathered not to 
register you to vote, but to register 
you as a victim of identity theft, 
because the scammer is taking your 
personal information to make you 
a victim of identity theft. Legitimate 
voter registration drives are not 
generally done over the phone, 
and they will never ask you for 
personal information. As always, 
follow the rule of not giving out 
personal identifying information on 
the telephone to anyone 
whom you have not called 
and are not sure who 
they are.

Unclaimed property
You are told through an email or other communication 
that there are billions of dollars of unclaimed or 
abandoned money being held by the states and federal 
government and that some of this money is yours. For a fee, 
this helpful person will assist you in locating your property and 
claiming it.
The truth is, various state and federal agencies are indeed holding 
more than 24 billion dollars of unclaimed money that is waiting 
to be retrieved by the rightful owners. State law requires ﬁ nancial 
institutions, such as banks, to turn over money from inactive 
accounts. Typical abandoned property includes savings or checking 
accounts, stocks, uncashed dividend checks, certiﬁ cates of deposit, 
and utility security deposits.
The illegal scam involving unclaimed property begins when you 
receive an email or other notice from a company that promises to do 
a free search on your behalf to locate any money that is being held 
by the government as abandoned property. You are told that all you 
have to do is call the company’s 809 number for more information. 
The ﬁ rst piece of information that you may not know is that by calling 
the 809 number, you incur a charge on your telephone bill. The call is 
not free. Then, in response to your call, the illegal scammers merely 
send you some useless general information while they inform you 
that you need to pay a membership fee or some other sort of fee 
before the search can proceed.
The legal scam involving unclaimed property occurs when you are 
contacted by a legitimate company that searches public records of 
the data banks of the individual state agencies holding unclaimed or 
abandoned property to identify people who may have property to be 
claimed. Once the company has identiﬁ ed these people, it contacts 
them and offers to help them through the process for a fee. However, 
due to privacy regulations, although the company contacting you 
may have general information that indicates that property of yours 
is being held by the state, the company does not know for sure if 
you are the true owner of the property and doesn’t know the value 
of the property being held. Most importantly, and why I believe that 

59
this is just a legal scam, all the information that you need to ﬁ nd 
property of yours that may be held by the government as unclaimed 
or abandoned property is available online at no charge to you. 
These companies cannot do anything that you cannot readily do for 
yourself.
The best place to begin your search for lost property being held 
by each of the 50 states is to go to the website of the National 
Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators at www.unclaimed.
org. This website can link you to your own state’s agency that deals 
with unclaimed or abandoned property. Some other useful websites 
that can help you ﬁ nd lost money are www.irs.gov, which is the 
website of the IRS to which you can go to ﬁ nd tax refund money 
you may be owed, and www.pbgc.gov, which is the website of the 
Pension Beneﬁ t Guaranty Corporation, a federal agency that holds 
unclaimed pension funds.
Loan scam
It’s easy to get a loan if you don’t need the money. However, if 
you really need the money, a low credit score may make it difﬁ cult 
to borrow from your local bank or credit union. Scammers take 
advantage of desperate borrowers through advertisements for 
phony loan companies with ofﬁ cial sounding names, such as “B & 
T Financial Group,” offering loans that are easy to qualify for even if 
your credit score is low. You provide your personal information in a 
credit application by phone, mail, or online. You are then told that if 
you wire a money order of between $500 and $1,000 for processing 
fees, your loan will be approved, and your money will be on its way.
The truth is, this is a scam. The only money that is on its way is the 
money that you send to the scammer. And, to make matters worse, 
not only will you lose the money you send for processing fees, but 
also the information you provide may lead to identity theft that may 
make you a victim a second time. The telltale clue in this, as in so 
many scams, is the advance fee payment. Legitimate lenders usually 
deduct fees from the loan amount. Do your homework, and check 
with your local Better Business Bureau and the consumer protection 
division of your state’s Attorney General before sending any personal 
information or money to an unfamiliar lender.

Gambling scam
As long as there have been people, there has been gambling. Early 
cave drawings depict gambling. Gambling with dice was popular 
in the Roman Empire. And, as long as there has been gambling, 
there has been someone either cheating or scamming people with 
a “system” that is touted to enable people to break the laws of 
probability.
The truth is, with the exception of Blackjack, the math is always in 
favor of the casino. And even with Blackjack, to exploit a potential 
slim mathematical advantage, it takes the brain of an MIT student, 
as shown by the success (for a while) of the famous MIT Blackjack 
team during the 1990s that beat the casinos for millions of dollars. 
Their system involved a sophisticated card counting system that 
determined when a signiﬁ cant number of high cards remained in 
the deck that would provide a slight mathematical edge to the card 
playing team member. Such a system is technically legal if no device 
or calculator is used at the Blackjack table. But it also takes the mind 
of an MIT student to pull it off.
A typical gambling scam is one that offers to sell you a system 
that can be used to win at the casinos. Playing on our memory of the 
MIT Blackjack team, the system offered is often said to have been 
designed by a mathematical scholar. Generally, the systems are 
merely variations of a strategy that goes back to French gamblers in 
the 1700s called the Martingale betting system. At its most basic, 
the strategy requires the gambler to double his bet after every loss 
so that in his ﬁ rst win, he will recover all his previous losses along 
with a proﬁ t. To the mathematically unsophisticated, this may seem 
somewhat attractive both in its simplicity to understand as well as 
the complex mathematical formulas that are purported to support 
this strategy. The truth is, this strategy would work only if you 
had an unlimited amount of money with which to gamble. 
Gambling systems that guarantee success are a scam. 
They always have been, and they always will be. You can 
bet on it.

Lottery and contest scams

62
Conmen know that everyone loves to win a prize. 
As a result, phony prize scams are rampant. It is 
hard enough to win a prize when you have entered a 
legitimate sweepstakes, but when you are notiﬁ ed that you have 
won a contest that you never even entered, you should be hearing 
“Danger Will Robinson” ringing in your head even if you never 
watched the old television show Lost in Space.
One form of a contest prize scam requires you to buy something 
to qualify for the prize that you have “won.” Generally, the things you 
are required to buy are particularly overpriced when compared to the 
prize that you have supposedly won.
Another common lottery scam involves up-front fees that you are 
required to pay to claim your terriﬁ c prize. Knowing that some people 
might be initially skeptical of being told that they have won a prize in 
an international lottery that they did not enter, one particular scam 
came in the form of an email purportedly from the FBI. The message 
line in your email read “FBI Internet Fraud Watch/Alert,” and the 
return email address gained people’s conﬁ dence by appearing as 
FBIfraudalert@hotmail.co.uk or FBIfraudwatch@hotmail.co.uk. The 
truth is, it was a scam. The email told you that you had won a big 
prize in a lottery sponsored by a large, familiar company such as 
Microsoft or MasterCard, and the lottery had been examined by both 
the FBI and Scotland Yard and determined to be legitimate. You were 
also told that the lottery funds were 
insured. So who wouldn’t send in a 
processing fee when both the FBI 
and Scotland Yard have assured 
you that the lottery is legitimate? 
Someone thinking clearly. Don’t 
let your greed overrule your brain. 
Never trust an email to be from 
whom it says it is from. The FBI does 
not work with or endorse particular 
lotteries.
Many people who received a check from Clorox, the bleach 
company, indicating that it was part of the “American Lottery 
Sweepstakes” may have merely thought that this was a legitimate

advertising promotion. Along with the check and a congratulatory 
letter, the victims received instructions to wire money (always a 
danger signal in scams) to a Canadian clearinghouse to cover the 
fees for processing the prize money. The truth is, this, too, is a scam. 
You don’t win contests that you have not entered. You don’t have 
to pay fees to receive winnings in legitimate sweepstakes. And you 
should never consider any check as real money, regardless of how 
legitimate it looks, until the funds have not only been deposited in 
your account, but also the check has actually cleared. As for money 
that you wire to the scammer while his check is in the process of 
bouncing; that money is gone forever.
Another form of prize scam involves the income taxes due on prize 
winnings. As with many scams, there is just enough of a kernel of 
truth in this assertion to make an unsuspecting victim susceptible 
to the scam. Lottery and contest 
winnings are generally subject 
to income taxes; however, the 
operators of scam lotteries tell you 
that you must pay them the income 
tax due on your prize. The truth 
is, you pay the tax on your prize 
winnings either directly to the IRS 
through an estimated tax payment, 
or the taxes are deducted from the prize before you receive it, in 
which case you would receive a Form 1099 from the sponsor of the 
sweepstakes informing you of the amount already deducted for your 
income taxes. Never pay income taxes to the sponsor of a lottery or 
other contest.
In another variation of the lottery scam, you may be sent a check 
for a portion of your winnings along with directions to send back 
money for processing fees. Unfortunately, the check from the phony 
lottery bounces, but your check back to the scammer does not. 
Adding insult to injury, some people who have fallen for this scam 
not only lost the money they sent to the scammer for processing fees 
but also were charged overdraft fees by their own bank when they 
bounced checks assuming that they had the prize money in their 
bank account.

Another lottery scam occurs when the scammer buys a lottery 
ticket choosing the winning numbers from the previous day’s or 
week’s lottery drawing. He then alters the date on the ticket to make 
it appear to be a winning ticket. Next, he approaches you with a sob 
story explaining why he cannot collect the money. Perhaps he is 
going through a divorce. Perhaps he is ineligible to claim the prize; 
this scam works particularly well with scammers who may appear 
to be teenagers. Whatever the reason, the result is the same: They 
offer to sell you the ticket so that 
you can collect the prize, and they 
get a signiﬁ cantly reduced amount 
of money from you. It’s a win-win 
solution, if you ever saw one. The 
truth is, buying a lottery ticket from 
anyone who is not in the 
business is a sucker’s bet.

Exercise scams
“We are never deceived; 
we deceive ourselves.”
—Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

66
A common feature of many exercise scams takes 
advantage of our desire to get in better shape with the 
least effort possible. Unfortunately, you are left with a 
program that often is expensive and doesn’t come close to the 
representations in the print advertisements or infomercials that 
prompted you to buy the product.
The truth is, exercise takes effort. There are many forms of exercise 
that can be enjoyable and not too taxing. There are tremendous 
beneﬁ ts to just a regular walking program. In fact, the key to a 
successful exercise program is to ﬁ nd something that you enjoy 
doing and feel comfortable ﬁ tting into your regular, daily routine. This 
is the only way you will stick with an exercise program for the period 
required to get into shape and maintain a healthy body weight. Too 
many pieces of exercise equipment are gathering dust or are used to 
hang clothes on after purchasers did not incorporate the particular 
exercise equipment into their daily lives.
One thing that all exercise scams have in common is exaggerated, 
overstated claims that we know in our hearts, not to mention our 
biceps, are too good to be true. If an exercise program or machine 
promises amazingly swift results without effort or promises to burn 
off fat from a particular part of your body, such as your waist or your 
buttocks, you should know the program is a scam.
Forget about the testimonials in the advertisements. The ﬁ ne print 
may even tell you that the results achieved by these people may not 
be typical. If you are considering an exercise program, talk with your 
physician or a certiﬁ ed trainer at a local gymnasium before buying a 
program or a particular piece of exercise equipment.
When you evaluate the price of the particular exercise equipment 
or program, look at the total price. How many “easy” monthly 
payments do you have to make? How much is the shipping and 
handling going to cost you? What are the delivery charges? What are 
the sales taxes? Exercise your mind and a little caution before you 
buy exercise equipment.
And don’t forget: The money-back guarantee for a scam 
exercise product is as much of a scam as the product itself. 
It is worthless. The truth is, you should never rely on the 
guarantees of a company you’re not totally familiar with.

Weight loss scams

68
Many of us need to drop a few pounds. Fortunately, 
losing weight is not particularly complicated. Eat a 
healthy diet with reasonable portions and exercise 
regularly. It’s simple, but not that easy. Many of us want a quick, 
easy way to lose weight. The market for weight loss programs and 
products is huge. The advertisements are compelling, often using 
celebrities we’re familiar with who proclaim the effectiveness 
of the particular weight loss product. Generally, these products 
share two important characteristics: They’re easy to use, and 
they’re not particularly effective.
In January 2007, the Federal 
Trade Commission (FTC) settled 
claims against four major marketers 
of weight loss products. Pursuant 
to the settlement, the companies 
Xenadrine EFX, CortiSlim, TrimSpa, 
and One-A-Day WeightSmart 
agreed to pay the government $25 
million in ﬁ nes as well as not to 
misrepresent studies purporting 
to support their products’ weight 
loss claims. They also agreed to 
stop their deceptive advertising. It should be noted that, consistent 
with similar settlements negotiated by the FTC, although all four 
companies agreed to forfeit substantial money and agreed to change 
their product claims, the companies ofﬁ cially denied that they had 
done any of the things they were accused of. In effect, the companies 
were permitted to say that they didn’t do anything wrong, but they 
promised not to do it again.
In the case of Xenadrine EFX, it was disclosed by the FTC that none 
of the studies commissioned by the company showed that using the 
product brought about substantial weight loss. In fact, in one of the 
studies, the users of Xenadrine EFX lost an average of 1.5 pounds 
over the entire ten-week duration of the study, while the control 
group that received a placebo lost 2.5 pounds during the same 
period. There is nothing like a good placebo. In addition, the FTC 
also alleged that the slim, attractive people whose “before and after”

69
pictures were used in the advertisements actually lost weight through 
rigorous exercise and diet rather than merely popping Xenadrine EFX 
tablets.
The lesson with weight loss products is to be skeptical. The truth 
is, there are no quick ﬁ xes. Here are a few rules to remember when 
evaluating weight loss products and programs.
Be wary of any weight loss product that is sold exclusively either 
over the Internet or through mail-order advertisements.
Don’t believe the claims of any weight loss product or program 
that promises that you can lose tremendous amounts of weight 
quickly without dieting or exercise.
No cream that you rub into your skin can help you lose 
substantial weight.
No product can block the absorption of fat or calories. There is 
no magic potion that will help you lose weight while still eating a 
high-calorie diet.
Spot reducing of hips, thighs, or 
anywhere else is impossible.
The Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) and the FTC are continually 
taking action against the scammers 
who operate phony diet programs 
and products, but their chances of 
keeping every phony diet program 
and product off the market are 
slim. Just because you see a 
product advertised in a legitimate 
newspaper, magazine, or television 
infomercial does not mean that 
the product is legitimate. The best 
course of action is to ask your 
physician about the effectiveness of a particular weight 
loss product or program before you reduce your wallet in 
an effort to reduce your waistline.

The CIA medical scam

72
Who could possibly fall for a claim that the CIA has spy 
satellites that can scan your body—while you sleep—for 
medical problems undetectable by conventional 
means, and that once identiﬁ ed, these problems can be cured 
by secret medicines—also while you sleep—that will keep you in 
robust health? No one, you say? Wrong. For six years, this story 
was the one used by Stacey Finley to scam people throughout 
Louisiana, Texas, and Mississippi out of close to a million dollars.
We often hear only what we want to hear. A quick and easy route 
to good health is enticing. The federal prosecutors of Stacey Finley 
described her victims as “solid, middle-class, educated citizens.”* 
These same people trusted someone because they thought they 
knew her. They thought she was their friend. They wanted to believe. 
Wanting to believe is a scam artist’s greatest ally. The lesson here 
is not to fall into the herd mentality. Scam artists depend on us 
following the recommendations and endorsements of well-meaning, 
trustworthy people, who themselves got taken in by these scams. 
Scam artists use the naiveté of their victims to expand their inﬂ uence. 
There is no substitute for skepticism and doing your own research. 
Fortunately, there is much legitimate medical information available 
online. Some valuable sources are the Merck Manuals (www.merck.
com/pubs), the National Institutes of Health (www.nih.gov), the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services (www.os.dhhs.gov), and 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (www.fda.gov).
Beware of touted products that 
will cure just about anything. Don’t 
trust testimonials. Legitimate 
medicines and treatments don’t 
carry testimonials. Beware of the 
quick ﬁ x. And don’t fall prey to the 
conspiracy theorists who tell you 
they have a secret medicine being suppressed by the large 
pharmaceutical companies because they will lose their 
proﬁ ts if everyone becomes aware of this miracle cure.

Education scams

74
Scholarship scams
Unless you’re careful, trying to ﬁ nd the money for 
higher education can put you at risk of being scammed. 
You may be encouraged to pay a fee to apply for a scholarship 
that you never receive. People often think that they merely have 
not won the scholarship—not that they have been scammed out 
of their money.
You may apply for an educational loan that carries a particularly 
low interest rate. However, there is one catch—you have to pay an 
advance fee to apply for the loan. Unfortunately, you never receive 
the promised loan, but you do manage to lose your advance fee. 
Any fees that may be required for a legitimate educational loan are 
deducted from the money you receive from the lender. You don’t 
have to pay the fees in advance.
Then there is the scholarship that 
you are notiﬁ ed you have already 
won, although you never applied 
for it. Any kind of prize, scholarship, 
or award that you are told you have 
won even though you never applied 
for it is probably a scam.
Some companies promise they’ll 
match you with scholarships that 
you’ll be eligible for, and that if 
you don’t get the scholarship, they’ll refund your money. Some of 
these companies are legitimate. Sort of. They may not be looking 
to steal your money, but they don’t have any greater access to free 
scholarship information than you do, particularly in these days of 
the ubiquitous availability of information on the Internet. You can 
ﬁ nd sources for free scholarship information at www.ﬁ naid.org, www.
fastweb.monster.com, and www.nasfaa.org, which is operated by the 
National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. Other 
companies offering to ﬁ nd a scholarship for you merely take your 
money and vanish into the night. You may be offered a money-back 
guarantee, but you probably won’t get your money back.
Many scholarship scams involve ﬁ nancial aid consulting. Finan-
cial aid consultants are not all scammers. Honest ﬁ nancial aid

consultants help people navigate through the Free Application for 
Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form for a fee of anywhere from $50 to 
$100. Others may charge as much as $1,000 to provide unethical 
information that can get you in trouble. Often these scammers tell 
you that they can show you how to shift ownership of family assets 
to increase the chances of getting greater needs-based ﬁ nancial 
aid. There are no legal tricks or strategies they can provide that you 
cannot obtain for free by going to www.ﬁ naid.org. Also be aware 
that if you pay a ﬁ nancial aid consultant for services, even if those 
services do not include assistance in actually ﬁ lling out the FAFSA 
form, the consultant is required by law to sign the FAFSA form. If the 
consultant refuses or is hesitant to sign the form, that should alert 
you to the possibility that you are dealing with an unethical advisor.
Watch out for anyone offering a scholarship who tells you that they 
need your credit card or bank account number just for identiﬁ cation 
purposes to hold the scholarship.
Diploma mills
A college degree can be helpful in getting a better job. But, as always, 
people look for shortcuts. Attaining a college degree can be a long 
and arduous process. You actually have to study. But what if you could 
get a college degree based on all that you have learned in life, your 
work history, or as the advertisements say, your “life experience?” 
That is the promise found in the advertisements placed in legitimate 
publications that tout the ability to get a college degree based not 
on a rigorous course of study, but rather just upon your accumulated 
wisdom garnered through years of on-the-job experience or just your 
“life experience.” Sound too good to be true? It is. Phony colleges that 
sell college degrees without requiring you to do any actual academic 
work to achieve that degree are called diploma mills, and the whole 
thing is a scam. Having a college degree can be helpful when applying 
for a job, but having a phony diploma will not enhance your resume. In 
fact, it can actually hurt your chances for employment if a prospective 
employer recognizes the degree listed on your resume as one that has 
been issued by a diploma mill.
So, how do you identify a diploma mill? Diploma mills often have 
names that appear quite legitimate or similar to institutions that you 
know are legitimate. Columbia State University is a diploma mill. 

76
Columbia University is an eminent Ivy League school. They have 
nothing to do with each other, but the similarity in their names can 
cause confusion.
Use common sense. What’s the value of a degree you didn’t 
have to do much academic work for? How signiﬁ cant is a diploma 
for which you had to do little or nothing more than pay your 
tuition, which can be as much as $5,000? Scammers exploit the 
fact that legitimate institutions do, in some instances, grant some 
credit—and I emphasize only some limited credit—for your work 
or life experiences. You still must complete substantial academic 
work to earn a degree. Also making it easier for this scam to appear 
legitimate is the fact that although many of these diploma mills exist 
exclusively online, most legitimate educational institutions now offer 
opportunities to take courses online.
A school that offers you a degree based exclusively on your work 
or life experience; that doesn’t require you to attend actual classes 
in person or online; that will grant you a degree for the payment of 
a ﬂ at fee as compared to paying for individual courses; and that will 
guarantee you a degree in a few days or weeks is illegitimate.
If you want to determine whether the school offering a program 
you’re interested in is a legitimate school that’s accredited by a 
legitimate source of accreditation and not by a sham organization 
that may even be sponsored by the phony school, you can go to 
the interactive Web site of the U.S. Department of education at 
www.ope.ed.gov/accreditation to 
check on the validity of the degree 
that you’re being offered.
A ﬁ nal word to the would-be wise: 
Not only may you be scammed if 
you pay for a worthless degree, you 
may also be committing a crime if 
you use the degree granted by a 
diploma mill. Some states, such as 
Oregon, have criminalized 
the use of diploma 
mill degrees by their 
“graduates.”
Not only may you

Romance scams

78
Online dating scams
The Johnny Lee song, “Looking for Love in All the Wrong 
Places,” featured in the movie Urban Cowboy might 
also be a good name for the various romance and dating scams 
that may be found on the Internet.
Online dating services and Web sites are in great supply, and many 
of them are quite legitimate. However, there are some illegitimate 
ones that are out to steal more than your heart. They also want 
your money. As in many other Internet scams, Nigeria is prominent 
in online dating scams. Similar to the Nigerian letter scam, the 
Nigerian dating scam gains your conﬁ dence by allowing you to 
make contact with someone who, like you, is looking for love. Online 
correspondence between victims and scammers progresses to a 
point where love grows and trust is established so that it doesn’t 
seem unreasonable when the object of the victim’s online romance 
asks for help cashing a check from his work in Nigeria or elsewhere. 
The scammers send checks or money orders to their victims, telling 
them that they can’t cash the checks in Nigeria for various technical 
or bureaucratic reasons, and ask the victims to cash the check, wire 
the money, and even keep a portion 
of the check as a token of their 
appreciation. Needless to say: The 
check is worthless. The victim is left 
with a broken heart and a reduced 
bank account when the check 
that appeared to be so legitimate 
bounces, while the check that the 
victim sent to her romantic partner 
in a land far away lessens her own 
bank account.
A picture is worth a thousand words
Online dating services generally include photographs of the 
participants. Many phony Nigerian dating scams have used pictures 
of models from the Web site www.focusagencyhawaii.com. Focus 
Hawaii is a legitimate company, but its pictures have often been 
misappropriated by scammers.
The Nigerian

someone who, like 
you, is looking for 
love.

Russian dating scam
From Russia with Love was the second James Bond movie, but it 
also could be the name of the scam that hooks people looking for 
romance on the Internet with allegedly Russian men and women 
who, after the relationship has sufﬁ ciently progressed online, hit 
their victims up for money to come to the United States or for other 
seemingly legitimate purposes back in Russia. Many of these scams 
are part of a highly organized crime ring in the Russian Republic 
of Mari El, which has been an independent country since 1990. 
Pictures used are often of Russian celebrities, but they also may be 
of ordinary, but attractive local women who are paid a small fee for 
their photographs. The organizers of this scam have rooms full of 
computers and, in many instances, local students, typing away the 
correspondence and getting paid a 10 to 15 percent commission on 
the money they con their victims out of worldwide. Despite the efforts 
of law enforcement in Mari El, this scam continues.
Secret admirer scam
Having a secret admirer can be ﬂ attering. Having a secret admirer 
steal your computer passwords, credit card numbers, and online 
banking information can be devastating. This particular scam begins 
when you receive an email that appears to be from one of the 
many online greeting card companies. Online greeting cards are a 
legitimate business. The cards can be clever combinations of music 
and animation. Not to mention the fact that if you forgot someone’s 
birthday till the birthday itself arrived, you can still send a card that 
gets there on time. Many of these online greeting card companies 
offer free cards.
The names of the online greeting card companies are familiar to 
many people. It’s easy as you go through your emails not to notice 
that what appears to be a notice of a card from one of the legitimate 
companies is instead from one with a very similar name. So you go to 
the email that contains a message that you have received an online 
greeting card with a link to the card. If you go to the link, you see 
the card sent to you by your secret admirer. Unfortunately, by linking 
to the malicious Web site, you also have unwittingly downloaded 
a Trojan horse, keystroke logging program that, without your being 
aware of it, tracks everything you do on your computer and sends

Rental car insurance

82
We’ve all had this happen to us. Pressure to buy rental 
car insurance.
You rent a car on vacation, and the clerk at the counter 
goes through some of the terms of the rental agreement with you. 
It is long, confusing, and full of ﬁ ne print, much of which remains 
undiscussed. Standing out in the form, however, is a section that 
the clerk points out to you and is so signiﬁ cant that it requires 
your initialing of a special box to indicate your choice. The special 
box deals with the optional insurance that the car rental agency 
urges you to purchase. It is at that time that many people have 
a brain freeze as you try hard to remember what you have heard 
regarding this insurance. Will your credit card cover your insurance 
needs? Does your own automobile 
insurance policy cover the same 
risks? The cost of the insurance can 
considerably increase the cost of 
renting the car, so the stakes are 
high. Do you need the coverage?
The truth is, in many instances, 
this is a legal scam. Generally, if 
you own a car and have your own 
automobile insurance, its coverage 
carries over to protect you while 
driving your rental car when the 
rental is not for a business trip. 
In addition, some credit card 
companies still provide insurance 
coverage for you while driving 
a rental car paid for through their credit card. The key to making 
the right decision and not getting scammed is to check with your 
automobile insurance agent and your credit card company 
well before your trip to learn precisely what coverage you 
have and what limitations there may be.

Personal information 
privacy

84
The privacy of your personal ﬁ nancial information held 
by companies you do business with, such as banks 
or credit card companies, is not just a matter of these 
companies sharing this information with other companies who 
ﬂ ood you with junk mail solicitations. As we see in the news, 
businesses are hacked into almost every week by identity thieves 
who harvest this information and use it to steal your money and 
ruin your credit. The more places that have your personal ﬁ nancial 
information, the more likely you are to become a victim of identity 
theft.
In 1999, Congress passed the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act. Congres-
sional press releases bragged about the protections this new law 
would bring to consumers concerned about the privacy of their 
personal data. However, if you actually read the law, you would ﬁ nd 
that rather than provide substantial consumer protection, the law’s 
primary objective was to permit banks, insurance companies, and 
investment companies to merge and do business together more 
effectively.
You probably remember receiving 
the ﬁ rst annual disclosure of the 
privacy policies of the ﬁ nancial 
companies, such as insurance 
companies, credit card companies, 
and brokerage companies you do 
business with, as required by the 
Gramm-Leach Bliley Act. But then 
again, maybe you don’t remember, 
because these disclosures just 
looked like much of the ﬁ ne-print junk mail that we often get from 
these companies. Many people didn’t even take the time to read 
these disclosures, and you can’t blame them, because the confusing 
language often bafﬂ ed those that did take the time to read these 
disclosures. The privacy disclosure was required by law to be clear, 
conspicuous, and accurate. Unfortunately, it was anything but clear, 
conspicuous, and accurate. The disclosure was supposed to inform 
consumers about the particular company’s policy regarding sharing 
your personal information with other companies.
The more places 
that have your 
personal ﬁ nancial 
information, the 
more likely you are 
to become a victim

Unbeknown to many consumers was the fact that, prior to 
the enactment of this law, many of the companies that you do 
business with were providing your personal information, not just to 
companies that they might have been afﬁ liated with, but even with 
telemarketers. The law now at least no longer permits the sharing of 
this information with telemarketers.
Consumers were told by Congress that their right to protect the 
conﬁ dentiality of their personal information was provided for in the law 
by giving consumers the ability to opt out of permitting the companies 
that they do business with from sharing that information with other 
companies. Forgetting for the moment the question as to why we 
should have to opt out of having our personal information shared 
rather than being required to opt in if we wanted our information to 
be shared with other companies, the truth is, even if you opt out of 
information sharing, the law is seriously ﬂ awed by loopholes and 
exceptions that still permit information sharing even if you opt out.
Even if you opt out of sharing 
information, the company you do 
business with can still share your 
personal information with any 
company it’s afﬁ liated with. An 
afﬁ liated company is a company 
that’s either owned or controlled 
by the company you do business 
with. In addition, even if you opt 
out of information sharing, the 
company holding your information 
can also share your personal 
information with any company it has 
a joint marketing agreement with. 
An example of a joint marketing 
agreement is where your bank 
agrees to endorse or offer insurance 
policies issued by another company.
So, ultimately, despite what Congress tells you, your ability to 
require businesses that have your personal ﬁ nancial information 
to keep that information private and secure is quite incomplete.

Yet, the truth is, if you haven’t yet opted out of sharing this

with from sharing this information with other companies, 
it’s still better than nothing.

Cramming
“There are some frauds so well 
conducted that it would be stupidity 
not to be deceived by them.”
—Charles Caleb Colton

88
Cramming is not just for exams. Cramming is also the 
name for unauthorized charges that appear on your 
telephone bill. These charges may be a one-time rip-
off, or they may turn into a regular monthly dip into your wallet. 
Telephone bills today are so complicated, long, and full of ﬁ ne 
print that many people either do not bother to read them, or just 
give up when they can’t understand them. Either way, scammers 
adding phony charges to your telephone bill rely on your inability 
to discover that you are a victim of cramming to continue their 
scam.
As Pogo, the cartoon character of years past, said, “We have 
met the enemy and he is us.” We often cause ourselves to be 
victimized when we’re not particularly careful. Many times at sporting 
events or other public gatherings, there will be booths sponsoring 
sweepstakes. It only takes a few moments to ﬁ ll in a sweepstakes 
application that carries the potential 
of a big prize. Unfortunately, few of 
us take the time to read the small 
print that provides the details of 
the sweepstakes. Buried within 
the ﬁ ne print of some of these 
sweepstakes’ materials is a notice 
that informs you that by completing 
the sweepstakes form, you are 
also signing up for a telephone 
calling card or other service that 
will be added to your telephone bill. 
Sometimes you don’t even get the 
service, but you always get the bill. In either case, it’s a scam to be 
avoided.
Some key phrases to look for in your telephone bill to determine 
if you are being crammed are “Miscellaneous charges and credits,” 
“Min Use Fee,” “Activation Fee,” “Member Fee,” “Voice Mail Fee,” or, 
for that matter, any fee that you don’t recognize. If you ﬁ nd 
such cramming charges, there will be instructions on your 
telephone bill as to how to dispute them.

900 numbers

90
When you call a telephone number that begins with 
900, you’re entering the world of telephone pay per 
call. Originally, 900 numbers were seen as a way for 
people to receive information or entertainment without having to 
use a computer. Unfortunately, although legitimate companies 
use 900 numbers and comply with the laws that regulate them, 
many unscrupulous scammers use 900 numbers to scam people 
out of their money.
One scam involves responding to an advertisement for a job by 
calling an 800 number. People are usually conﬁ dent that when they 
call a telephone number that begins with the digits 800 or 888, 
they’re calling a toll-free number. Generally, that’s true. However, 
many people are unaware of a scam through which the 800 number 
that you call gets transferred to a 900 number and, without your 
being aware of it, you’re charged 
for the call. In one particular job 
advertisement 900 number scam, 
when you call the 800 number, 
you’re greeted by a recorded 
message that asks you to press 
#9 to verify your phone number. 
Unsuspecting victims do so without 
realizing that by pressing #9, they 
have just transferred their call to a 
900 number. Once this is done, the 
unwitting victim is asked question 
after question, not for purposes of 
an interview relating to a job, but 
merely to keep the victim on the line 
so that the phone charges incurred 
while discussing a nonexistent job 
can grow and grow. This switching 
scam is prohibited by federal regulations, but that doesn’t stop the 
scammers from making these calls.
If you’re a victim of this switching scam, you will not become aware 
of being victimized until you see your next telephone bill containing 
the scam-related charges. Contact your telephone company and tell 
them to remove the fraudulent charges from your bill. You should, 
When you call 
the 800 number,

by a recorded 
message that

…by pressing #9, 
they have just 
transferred their 
call to a 900

91
however, be prepared to be harassed by a collection agency on 
behalf of the scammer even if you are successful in having the 
charges removed from your telephone bill. If you are contacted by a 
collection agency attempting to collect on an 800 number call that 
was switched to a 900 number call, tell the collection agency that 
you were switched from an 800 number to a 900 number without 
being told, which violates federal regulations.
TIP You may want to consider having your telephone provider put a 
block on your telephone line to prevent access to 900 numbers 
from your telephone number.
The truth is, even some 800 and 888 telephone numbers 
are permitted to charge you for calls if the call provides audio 
entertainment or information services. However, the law requires 
that these companies comply with the FTC rules that regulate 900 
numbers. These rules require that you be asked at the start of the call 
to pay with a credit card or make billing arrangements at that time. 
The company must also provide you with its name, address, business 
telephone number, and rates for its services.
Direct American Marketers, 
Inc. (DAMI) sent out millions of 
sweepstakes notices throughout 
the country telling people to call a 
900 number to claim the prize they 
were lucky enough to have won. 
Unfortunately, the only big winner 
of this sweepstakes was DAMI. The 
average 900 number telephone 
call by “winners” inquiring as to the 
prize they had won in a contest that 
they had not entered was about 
seven minutes, which resulted in a charge of anywhere from $20 
to $40 being added to their telephone bill. Following actions by a 
number of states’ Attorneys General, DAMI went out of business and 
declared bankruptcy.

The truth is, federal law requires sweepstakes promoters to tell 
you the odds of winning before you have to call a 900 number. The 
promoters are also required to tell you how to get the information as 
to whether you have won or lost for free. A loophole in this federal 
law, however, is that this does not apply to contests where you have 
to answer a question, regardless of how simple, to win. The 
bottom line is that 900 numbers are moneymakers, but not 
for the caller.

Phony caller ID

94
Phony caller ID is a real boon. If you get a call from 
someone you don’t wish to speak to, you merely let 
your answering machine take the call. If it is someone 
you do wish to speak to, the caller ID screen tells you who is 
calling, so you don’t have to worry about recognizing her voice.
However, caller ID isn’t always accurate. Identity thieves are able 
to manipulate caller ID systems so that telephone calls from them 
appear to be from someone else, such as, for instance, the local 
district court. People who have fallen for a particular variation of this 
scam received a telephone call that appeared to be from their local 
district court. When they answered 
the phone, they were told that they 
had failed to appear for jury duty. 
When the victims told the caller 
that they didn’t receive a notice to 
appear for jury duty, the caller then 
asked for personal information, 
such as a Social Security number to 
conﬁ rm the identity of the person 
receiving the call. Once the victim 
did that, the trap was sprung. The 
scammer had all the information 
needed to make the person 
receiving the call a victim of identity 
theft. You should never give personal information over the 
telephone to anyone you haven’t called, regardless of what 
your caller ID may say.

Area code 809

96
Area code 809 is the area code of a telephone number 
you are asked to call by way of a message left on your 
answering machine.
Most people are unfamiliar with the 809 area code or think that 
it, like 800 numbers, represents a toll-free call. The truth is, area 
code 809 is an area code for much of the Caribbean, most of which, 
except for the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, are not subject to 
American laws and regulations that regulate pay for call services. The 
message that you receive tells you to return the call for any number 
of compelling reasons, such as that you have won a prize, that a 
family member is sick or died, or even that a family member has been 
arrested. If you return the call, you will be charged $25 per minute, 
and the person on the other end of the call will endeavor to keep you 
on the phone as long as possible to run up your bill.
You should never return a call from an 809 area code unless 
you know the person calling, such as a relative vacationing in the 
Caribbean. If you do fall victim to this scam, you will ﬁ nd a large 
charge for the call on your next telephone bill. Immediately, you 
should contact your telephone company and long-distance carrier 
and inform them that you are disputing the call. Your telephone 
service cannot be terminated for 
your refusal to pay for these calls. 
However, as with scam 900 number 
calls, you should be prepared to be 
contacted by a collection agency 
attempting to collect on the call. 
Fortunately, even if the call was not 
subject to federal regulations, the 
scammer will not be able to collect 
the “debt” through a foreign court. 
The scammer must get a judgment 
against you in the United States, 
and it is unlikely that the scammer 
will ﬁ le a lawsuit against you in an American court, so don’t be 
bullied by a collection agency that threatens to take you to 
court. In fact, the threat to take you to court to collect the 
“debt” may even constitute an unfair collection practice in 
violation of federal law.

return a call from

Fear and loathing of the IRS
“By the time the fool 
has learned the game, the 
players have dispersed.”
—African proverb

98
The income tax is fertile ground for scammers. No one 
likes paying taxes. Unfortunately, the almost universal 
desire to avoid paying income taxes can be exploited by 
conmen with phony tax scams. There also are some people who 
believe that the federal income tax itself is a scam. This belief is 
also used by con artists to advance their scams. Even our fear of 
the IRS and our desire to follow the rules when contacted by them 
can be used against us when it comes to phony tax scams.
The “Slavery Reparations” scam, 
for instance, continues to be with 
us despite the best efforts of the 
federal government to quash it. 
Conmen tell African Americans that, 
for a fee, they will help them get a 
substantial tax credit or refund that 
the law provides as reparation for 
slavery. Often the con artists tell 
their victims that although this is 
the law, the government is quite secretive about this to reduce the 
number of people who can take advantage of it. Once again, a kernel 
of truth is enough for a conman to grow a scam that can entrap 
people who want to believe. In this case, at the end of the Civil War, 
Congress passed a bill authorizing the payment to all former slaves of 
40 acres of land and a mule as compensation for their enslavement. 
However, the bill was vetoed by President Andrew Johnson and never 
became law.
The risks of getting involved in this scam can be signiﬁ cant. You 
not only lose the money that you pay the con artist, but you also risk 
being assessed a $500 penalty by the IRS for merely making the 
claim and thereby ﬁ ling a fraudulent income tax return. Previously, 
the IRS did not assess this penalty unless a person had ﬁ led a claim 
for slavery reparations after being informed by the IRS that the claim 
was invalid. However, now the IRS takes the position that it may 
assess the penalty against anyone who ﬁ les such a claim, even once.
The IRS’ attempts to quash this scam certainly were not helped 
by its own admission that it had mistakenly paid out as many as 
200 slavery reparations claims for a total of $30 million. However, 
once these mistaken payments were discovered, the IRS took action

to recover the money improperly sent to those people who did 
receive slavery reparation payments.
You don’t even have to leave the comfort of your home to become 
a victim of a scam. Some conmen come to your door and tell you that 
they are from the IRS and that they are there to collect your taxes. The 
truth is, no IRS ﬁ eld auditor would ever come to your home without 
calling ﬁ rst. He also would have a photo identiﬁ cation card. In any 
event, if someone comes to your door and tells you that he is from 
the IRS, you can always call the IRS directly to check on the identity of 
the person on your stoop.
Phony tax forms
Scammers often use phony tax forms to obtain your personal 
information, which is used to turn you into a victim of identity theft.
One scam tax form appears to be an ofﬁ cial request for information 
from your bank or the IRS. It requests personal information such 
as your marital status, place of birth, bank account numbers, 
employment history, and parents’ names. The form looks quite 
ofﬁ cial and, as often is the case, has some similarity to legitimate 
forms. Another phony form that has been making the rounds is a 
“Reporting and Withholding Exemption Form” that purports to be 
from your bank or the IRS. This particular scam form asks for your PIN 
and the maiden name of your mother. No such IRS form exists. And 
no IRS form ever asks about your mother or your PIN.
Another commonly used scam 
tax form is a Form W-9095, 
which is titled Application for 
Certiﬁ cate Status Ownership for 
Withholding Tax. This form has 
a strong resemblance to the legitimate IRS Form W-9 Request for 
Taxpayer Identiﬁ cation Number and Certiﬁ cation. Anyone who has 
ever obtained a mortgage loan with a tax escrow account is familiar 
with the W-9. However, the phony form asks for much more personal 
identifying information than the W-9.
Whenever you’re confronted by a tax form you’re 
unfamiliar with that asks for personal information, check 
with the IRS to make sure it’s not a scam.
No IRS form ever 
asks about your 
mother or your PIN.

Notices from the IRS usually are dreaded. They rarely 
seem to be good news. But, that’s not so when you’re 
receiving a tax refund.
One scam that takes advantage of this mindset occurs when you 
receive an email that claims to be from the IRS. One scammer used 
taxrefunds@irs.gov as an email address. Another phony address 
used was admin@irs.gov. Both addresses sure look good, but they 
sure are bad. In the letter from the phony IRS, you’re told that you’re 
eligible for a tax refund. To obtain your tax refund, you’re told to 
use the form that you can access through a link in the email. The 
link takes you to a phony IRS Web site that asks for personal and 
ﬁ nancial information. The ﬁ rst thing to remember if you receive such 
a letter is that the IRS won’t notify 
you by email, and they won’t ask for 
personal identifying information or 
ﬁ nancial information. You should 
also keep in mind that it isn’t 
necessary to ﬁ le a form other than 
your income tax return to obtain a 
tax refund. Finally, don’t under any 
circumstances download anything in an email that you think may not 
be genuine. Unbeknown to you, you may be downloading a keystroke 
logging program that can infect your computer and transfer all of your 
computer’s activity to the identity thief who sent you the message.
Electronic ﬁ ling tax scam
Filing your tax return electronically can be quite helpful in avoiding 
a number of situations in which your income tax return could be 
misappropriated and used to steal your identity. However, this very 
system, which is called the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System 
(EFTPS), is also used as the basis for a scam to steal your identity. The 
scam starts when you receive an email purportedly from the IRS that 
tells you that someone else has used your credit card and tried to pay 
income taxes through the EFTPS. To correct the situation, as well as 
receive funds that the IRS is holding in the victim’s name, you must 
click on a link in the email to go to an IRS Web site and complete a 
form. Unsuspecting victims who do go to the Web site ﬁ nd something 
that looks ofﬁ cial, but actually it’s not. The Web site asks for personal

The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the federal 
agency that investigates tax fraud, found numerous phony IRS Web 
sites emanating from 18 different countries including Argentina, 
Aruba, Australia, Austria, Canada, Chile, China, England, Germany, 
Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Singapore, 
and Slovakia. No matter how authentic they may look (and it’s 
easy to compose a phony Web site with graphics that look like the 
legitimate IRS), the IRS doesn’t use 
email to contact people, and the IRS 
doesn’t ask for personal ﬁ nancial 
information. In addition, look at 
the Web site’s address. It may be 
a tip-off. One such phony Web site 
was http://tzk.kozle.pl. Whenever

received from the IRS is genuine.
IRS is illegal scam
No one likes paying income taxes, but they are legal. People who 
believe scammers who try to sell them a system to avoid having to 
pay federal income taxes are asking for trouble. The IRS has never 
lost a single court case on the issue of whether the federal income 
tax system is constitutional. The arguments used by people selling 
you their “inside” information as to how you can avoid paying income 
taxes may sound legitimate. They may even quote statutes and 
regulations that you’re unfamiliar with, that really sound 
compelling, but the bottom line is that all of these schemes

Phony trusts
Phony trusts that sometimes go under the name “Pure 
Trusts,” “Pure Equity Trusts,” or “Common Law Trusts” 
are another scam tactic that the promoters of these trusts know 
is not a legitimate way to avoid taxes. Placing all your assets in a 
trust that you control doesn’t avoid income taxes. However, this 
fact doesn’t stop the promoters of such trusts, used for income 
tax avoidance, from selling the scammer’s “special knowledge” 
and such trusts to avoid paying income taxes.
David Marvin Swanson’s business, 
Dynamic Monetary Strategies, sold 
fraudulent trusts that he called 
unincorporated business trust 
organizations which, according to 
Swanson, could protect income 
and assets from federal income tax. 
The federal government disagreed 
and obtained an injunction preventing him from making these 
representations and selling these trusts. Since 2001, more than 
200 similar injunctions have been obtained, shutting down phony 
income tax avoidance schemes.
Offshore accounts
Another scam used by people to avoid income taxes is putting assets 
in an offshore bank account. Indicative of the fact that offshore 
accounts are subject to federal income taxes is the section on your 
IRS 1040 form where you are required to answer, under the pains and 
penalties of perjury, questions as to whether you have any offshore 
bank accounts or trusts. People with offshore accounts are faced with 
the choice of lying to the IRS and committing perjury or telling the 
truth and alerting the IRS to a possible scam. Thinking that they are 
more shrewd than Wile E. Coyote, some promoters of these offshore 
scams have promoted offshore accounts in various Caribbean 
countries that have strong ﬁ nancial privacy laws ﬁ guring what the IRS 
doesn’t know can’t hurt them. The fatal ﬂ aw in this plan, however, is 
that although people access their money in these accounts through 
credit cards issued through these foreign banks, the records for

IRS collections
A letter from the IRS is not one 
of life’s pleasures. A call from 
a collection agency is also not 
something that people tend to 
enjoy. Put them together, and 
you have a gift to conmen and identity thieves. The IRS, in its 
inﬁ nite wisdom, has started a program through which thousands 
of taxpayers who owe less than $25,000 may be contacted by 
private collection ﬁ rms that have been hired by the IRS to collect 
overdue taxes, penalties, and interest. The IRS is hiring private 
collection agencies to collect this money even though the cost to the 
government of having these overdue taxes collected by collection 
agencies is much higher than 
having IRS employees do it. But 
that isn’t the worst of the situation. 
The possibility of fraud by people 
claiming to be from a private 
collection agency authorized by 
the IRS to collect taxes is great. The 
truth is, the simplest way to protect 
yourself from potential fraud is to 
just not deal with these collection 
agencies at all. If you’re contacted

agency, you have the right to merely

 “It’s morally wrong to allow

Confusion about government beneﬁ t programs is fertile 
ground for scammers. Social Security has been the 
basis for many con artists, who use this confusion to 
take advantage of unwary seniors.
One common Social Security scam 
involves promises by the criminals 
that they can get back to you from 
the federal government all of the 
Social Security tax payments you’ve 
made throughout your lifetime. 
For the proverbial “small fee,” 
which is usually about $100 and a 
percentage of the refund that never comes, the con artist promises to 
ﬁ le the proper claims forms with the IRS. The truth is, there’s no such 
program. Social Security tax payments are never refundable. 
The victims pay their fees and wait for a refund that never comes.
Direct deposit veriﬁ cation scam
Another Social Security scam involves a call you receive from 
someone purporting to be from the Social Security Administration 
who says that he needs to verify your direct deposit banking 
information. It’s easy to fall victim to this type of scam, but the truth 
is, you should never give personal information over the phone to 
anyone whom you haven’t called. If you think that a call from Social 
Security might be legitimate, you should call your local Social Security 
Administration ofﬁ ce to conﬁ rm the identity of the person calling you.
The windfall scam
Yet another Social Security scam occurs when you’re told that your 
beneﬁ ts are being reduced because you’ve inherited a home or 
money from a deceased relative. You’re told that you must pay back 
beneﬁ ts you’ve received. The truth is, Social Security isn’t a program 
based on need or that you must qualify for by having a limited 
amount of assets, so the basic premise is wrong. Yet, unwitting 
victims pay the amounts demanded to the scammers, who say 
they’re collecting on behalf of the government.

One particularly insidious Social Security scam preys on our fear of 
identity theft. Many people have received an email that purported to 
be from the Social Security Administration warning the recipient that 
they were the victim of identity theft and that someone was using 
their Social Security number. They were then directed to a phony 
Web site that looked like an ofﬁ cial Social Security Administration 
Web site, where they were directed to conﬁ rm their identity not just 
with their Social Security number, but also bank information, credit 
card information, and even PIN 
information. This is the real indicator 
that you’re being scammed. The 
truth is, under no circumstance 
would the Social Security 
Administration ever ask for your 
credit card information and certainly 
not your PIN. Once again, the rule 
is that you should never give out 
personal information to someone 
that you didn’t contact, and only 
then when you’re conﬁ dent that the 
information being given is secure. When in doubt, call Social Security 
if you ever receive anything that says it is an ofﬁ cial communication 
seeking personal information.
COLAS
Colas can be quite refreshing. For Social Security recipients, COLAs, 
which is an acronym for Cost of Living Adjustments, are annual 
additions to Social Security beneﬁ t checks that get paid automatically 
to recipients. Each year, scammers take advantage of news stories 
about COLAs to scam people through identity theft. Typically, the 
Social Security recipient will receive an email, such as was done in 
a large-scale scam in late 2006, that there will be a cost-of-living 
adjustment beginning in January of the next year. However, then 
comes the hook and the scam. The email goes on to tell you that, 
to receive your increase in beneﬁ ts, you must update your personal 
information with the Social Security Administration. And even 
worse, you’re told that if you don’t update your information by a

told that you can merely click on

to takes you to a Web site that looks

phony one that asks for personal information, such as your Social 
Security number, that’s used to make you a victim of identity theft. 
The truth is, you should never provide your Social Security number 
to anyone online unless you’re absolutely sure about the identity of 
the person you share it with. As for this particular scam, 
you might also ask yourself: Why would the Social Security

Medicare

Medicare, the national health insurance program for 
people over the age of 65, is an attractive area for 
scams. Like most medical insurance programs, it’s 
complicated, and this always feeds into the hands of scammers. 
In addition, many older Americans are more trusting than many 
younger people, which also makes them attractive targets. Finally, 
Medicare is an insurance program that involves the deep pockets 
of both insurance companies and the U.S. Treasury, which makes 
the stakes high for scammers looking for a lucrative target.
Medicare prescription 
drug scam
The recently enacted Medicare 
prescription drug program is 
helping millions of American seniors 
pay for their prescription drugs. But 
it’s confusing. As always, scammers 
take advantage of this confusion to 
their own ends. Many seniors have 
received telephone calls about a 
phony prescription drug plan being 
offered as a part of the Medicare 
Part D prescription drug program. 
The scam has become known as the “299 dollar ring” because that’s 
the typical amount that a Medicare-eligible senior is told to withdraw 
from his checking account to enroll in the ﬁ ctional plan. Other times, 
the caller asks for your checking account information, credit card 
information, or other personal information that can be used to steal 
money from you. The answer to these calls should always be the 
same. As Nancy Reagan used to say, “Just say no.” No legitimate 
Medicare prescription drug plan has an initial enrollment 
fee. And no legitimate Medicare prescription drug program 
will ever ask you for personal information over the phone.

Veteran scams

116
Veteran’s insurance scam
No one is safe from being targeted by scammers, 
and veterans of the military service are no exception. 
Additionally, veterans are accepting of the fact that much of the 
way that our government in general and the military speciﬁ cally 
operate is ﬁ lled with complexity, which makes the job of a 
scammer that much easier.
Many veterans have been receiving notices that appear to be 
from the Veteran’s Administration informing them of recent federal 
legislation that provides for a “dividend” on the life insurance that all 
military personnel are provided while they are on active duty. Notices 
of this new law have also even been posted on bulletin boards in VA 
medical facilities. According to the email, letter, or notice, the new law 
provides for a payment of as much as $528 to insured veterans. The 
notice also states that veterans are eligible for this beneﬁ t even if they 
didn’t maintain their insurance after leaving the service. Then comes 
the kicker. The veteran is informed that the beneﬁ t is not automatic. 
He’s told that he must apply for the beneﬁ t and must provide 
identifying information, such as birth date and Social Security number.
This is another identity theft 
scam. There’s no such law. 
Scammers merely use the personal 
identiﬁ cation information provided 
by victims of the scams to steal 
their identity. The best course of 
action, as always, when asked for 
personal information by anyone 
whom you haven’t contacted 
directly is to contact the legitimate 
organization at a telephone number 
that you know is correct and 
verify the accuracy of the original 
communication.
Veteran’s Administration pharmacy
Disabled veterans are another easy target for scammers. A recent 
scam involved disabled veterans receiving a telephone call from 
someone representing himself to be from the VA pharmacy, saying

that they needed personal information, including the veteran’s Social 
Security number along with a list of the prescription drugs he is 
taking, because of new co-pay regulations. In some instances, the 
caller tells the veteran to supply a credit card number to pay for such 
co-payments.
This is a scam. The information taken is used for identity theft and 
to make charges to the victim’s credit card. There are no such new 
regulations pertaining to co-payments for veterans who use the 
Veteran’s Administration to obtain their prescription drugs, and under 
no circumstances does the Veterans Administration contact veterans 
by telephone for personal information or regarding prescription 
renewals. The rule to follow, as always, is not to give out personal 
information on the phone to anyone unless you’re positive as to the 
identity of the person requesting the information.
Medicare free medical equipment scam
There are no free lunches, and there certainly are no free motorized 
wheelchairs. A common Medicare scam occurs when a scammer 
offers medical equipment or medical screening tests to a Medicare 
recipient. Your new friend may tell you that even though the 
particular piece of medical equipment or test is not generally 
covered by Medicare, he knows how to manipulate the system to get 
Medicare to cover the expense. The 
truth is, before Medicare will pay 
for medical equipment, a doctor 
must certify that the equipment or 
test is medically necessary. Some 
scammers fake signatures or use 
crooked doctors as accomplices 
to ﬁ le false claims. In both cases, 
you’re in danger of getting a bill for 
equipment that Medicare refuses 
to pay.
In other instances, scammers troll for seniors on the telephone, in 
malls, or in retirement homes with offers for medical services that will 
be paid for by Medicare. You provide your Medicare number, but you 
get nothing in return except a bill to your insurance company.

PART VIII: THE TRUTH ABOUT CREDIT CARD SCAMS
TRUTH

Credit cards
“Who is going to believe a con 
artist? Everyone, if she’s good.”
— Andy Grifﬁ th as Matlock

120
It isn’t uncommon for you to receive a notice for a credit 
card that seems to say that you’ve been preapproved 
(whatever that may mean) for a credit card that may 
provide you with a low interest rate, a high credit limit, and an 
incredible rewards program. In fact, it may promise just about 
anything. The truth is, the preapproval letter actually is just an 
invitation to apply for a credit card at an interest rate that will 
be determined later depending on your credit report and credit 
history.
When you actually receive a 
credit card after responding to the 
“preapproved” application, you 
should make it a point to carefully 
read the ﬁ ne print of the card holder 
agreement, not just the letter that 
comes with the card, because within 
the tiny print and the confusing 
language of the card holder 
agreement is found the actual terms 
of that particular credit card. You 
may ﬁ nd that the terms bear little 
resemblance to what you thought 
you were getting. 
Unfortunately, the law still permits credit card companies to 
mislead people, particularly people who do not take the time to read 
the ﬁ ne print. Failure to read the ﬁ ne print in a credit card agreement 
can be detrimental to your ﬁ nancial well-being. Cigarette packages 
carry warnings. Credit cards probably should, too. It isn’t unusual for 
people to seek a new credit card with a high enough credit line to 
carry the balance transferred from a previous card as well as carry 
new purchase debt. However, sometimes people assume that they’ve 
gotten the credit line they applied for and use their new card for 
the ﬁ rst time only to ﬁ nd out that the entire credit line was used by 
the transferred balances, leaving them with an over-the-credit-line 
fee and a card that has no credit left for purchases. If you ﬁ nd that 
the terms of the credit card you receive are not what you thought 
you were getting, don’t activate the card. Cut it up. Or call the credit 
card company and try to negotiate the terms you want. If you can’t

get those terms, be prepared to walk away. Don’t just not use the 
card. Don’t even activate it, because merely activating the card may 
subject you to fees and adversely affect your credit report.
TIP  If you don’t want to receive unsolicited credit card offers, you 
can opt out of receiving the so-called preapproved credit 
card solicitations by calling 1-888-5-OPT-OUT or by going to 
the Web site of the consumer credit reporting industry, www.
optoutprescreen.com. Some of you may be a bit wary when 
you call the telephone number or go online to have your name 
deleted from the lists, because you’re asked for your Social 
Security number, but you can feel relatively conﬁ dent that this 
is not a scam. Far from being a scam, having your name taken 
off these lists can dramatically improve your chances of not 
becoming a victim of identity theft.
Credit card fees
Fees are big business for credit card issuers. Go over your credit 
limit by the slightest amount, and you may be facing a penalty fee. 
To make matters worse, this penalty fee can be assessed on your 
account multiple times during the same month because many banks 
impose this charge whenever a charge is over your credit limit rather 
than at the end of the month. And, to add insult to injury, banks 
may approve a charge at the time it is made even though it puts 
the customer over his credit limit and then hit the customer with a 
penalty fee. The credit card issuers say that they allow you to exceed 
your credit limit as a “convenience” to you. And, to make things even 
worse, the ﬁ ne print in your credit card agreement may permit the 
credit card issuer to raise your interest rate to a ﬁ gure higher than the 
drinking age if you go over your spending limit.
And even if you’re completely up-to-date in your payments at all 
times, and even if you have a “ﬁ xed” rate credit card, the credit card 
company can change your interest rate whenever it desires by giving 
you 15 days notice of the change. A ﬁ xed rate merely means that, 
unlike a variable rate that automatically increases in accordance with 
a regular index, your ﬁ xed rate is ﬁ xed for only as long as the credit 
card issuer desires and can change whenever the issuer of the credit 
card so determines.

Universal default
You make sure you pay your credit card bill every month on time. 
Surely you’re at no risk of having your credit card interest rate singled 
out for a large penalty-triggered increase. After all, you didn’t miss a 
payment, and you weren’t late with a payment. Unfortunately, you’re 
still at risk. The ﬁ ne print in some credit card agreements says that 
if you’re late with any payment to 
anyone—the telephone company, 
your car payment, or your rent, for 
example—the credit card company 
reserves the right to increase your interest rate to a punitive rate as 
high as 32 percent. Always read the ﬁ ne print.
Late fees scam
If you read your monthly credit card statement carefully, you will note 
that your monthly payment must not only arrive by a speciﬁ c day, but 
by a speciﬁ c time within that day, such as 1:00 p.m., or your payment 
is considered late and you are subject to a punitive late fee. These 
late fees add up. Between 1995 and 2006, according to the General 
Accountability Ofﬁ ce, late fees rose more than 160 percent, to an 
average of $33.64. About 70 percent of the more than $17 billion that 
the credit card issuers assessed in penalty fees in 2006 came from 
late fees.
A particularly irritating variation on the late fee is the Same Day 
Payment Fee, where your credit card issuer charges you a fee, usually 
about $15, for transferring money electronically from your bank to the 
credit card issuer. In other words, if you ﬁ nd that your payment has 
not been made in a timely fashion, leaving no time to send it through 
the mail, and you send it in electronically to avoid a late 
charge, you’re charged an “on time charge” merely because 
you sent the money electronically.
Always read the 
ﬁ ne print.

More credit card offers

Credit card balance transfers
Many banks encourage you to transfer your outstanding 
balances from other credit cards to a new credit card 
that they issue you. By doing this, you’re promised that you’ll be 
able to pay off your outstanding credit card balance at a low or 
even zero percent interest rate.
But if the bank issuing the new credit card is charging you no 
interest on the amount you’re transferring, they must be looking to 
make a proﬁ t on your business somewhere else. Generally, if the 
bank is offering you a zero percent interest rate on the balance of 
your previous credit card that you’re transferring to the new credit 
card, they will be charging you a proﬁ t-making interest on new 
purchases you make using the new credit card. And in another 
example of there rarely being 
anything ﬁ ne in ﬁ ne print, the 
conditions of your new credit 
card will generally state that any 
payments you make will be ﬁ rst 
applied to the transferred balance, 
with interest accumulating on any 
and all purchases made using 
the new credit card. In addition, 
although you may get a low percent 
interest rate by transferring an 
outstanding balance to a new card, there are, of course, charges for 
transferring the balance. At one time, the fee was 3 percent of the 
amount that you transferred, with a cap of generally $75. However, 
now many credit card issuers have lifted the cap, so a transfer of a 
balance of $7,500, for example, may cost you $225 even though 
that amount bears no relationship to either the cost or the risk of 
transferring the balance to the new card.
The check is in the mail—convenience checks
All of us who have credit cards periodically receive from our friends 
at the credit card company a block of “convenience checks” that we 
can use to access the credit line of our credit card. Convenient they 
may be, but they also could be considered a legal scam. Start off with 
the fee for using the convenience check that may be 3 to 4 percent 
They will be 
charging you a 
proﬁ t-making 
interest on new 
purchases you 
make using the 
new credit card.

125
of the amount of the check. Add to this the fact that the interest rate 
for these convenience checks is probably greater than the voting 
age. And then comes the risk from the illegal scammers. If the 
blank convenience checks are stolen from your mail and used by an 
identity thief, you won’t know about it until you read your next credit 
card monthly bill and see the shocking news. Unlike unauthorized 
charges on a credit card, where your liability is limited by federal law 
to no more than $50, there is no federal law that limits your liability 
with convenience checks. And although you can stop credit card 
companies from sending you solicitations for new credit cards, you 
cannot stop them from sending you convenience checks. You can ask 
very nicely, but the credit card companies don’t have to honor your 
request.
Credit card theft insurance
The credit card companies are excellent at selling you things you 
don’t need. If they could, they would sell umbrellas in the Sahara 
desert. So it should come as no surprise that they sell you insurance 
to cover your losses if your card is stolen or lost. But why would you 
even consider paying for this when 
your maximum exposure if your card 
is lost or stolen is only $50, and 
most credit card companies don’t 
even charge you that amount?
Credit card disability

Disability insurance may be one of 
the least used and most important 
insurance coverage available today. 
However, even Thomas Jefferson

Skimmers and ATM scams

128
Skimmers
Skim milk may help to keep you thin, but a skimmer 
may make your wallet thinner.
A skimmer is a small electronic device about the size of a deck of 
cards that is used by a rogue salesclerk, waiter, or anyone to whom 
you give your credit card to steal from you. This person swipes your 
card through the skimmer, which reads the information contained on 
the magnetic strip on the card and gets all your personal information 
contained on the card. Identity thieves then use this information 
to fraudulently use your credit card and steal your identity. In 
many instances, the people initially skimming your card gather the 
information contained on the skimmer about your card and many 
others victimized at the same location and sell this information to 
other criminals, who use the information to create phony credit cards. 
And just like the cost of so much technological equipment such as 
ﬂ at screen televisions have come down over the years, so has the 
cost to criminals of skimming equipment. Skimmers can be bought 
over the Internet for a few hundred dollars, and the equipment to 
make counterfeit credit cards with the information gathered on the 
skimmer can be had online for a few thousand dollars.
A good practice is to watch your 
credit card from the time it leaves 
your hand until the time you get 
it back. Unfortunately, this is not 
always an easy rule to follow, 
particularly in restaurants.
Fraud scams
Federal law limits your liability for 
the fraudulent use of your credit 
card if it’s lost or stolen to $50. And, in most instances, the credit card 
companies even waive this charge. However, often the greatest harm 
that occurs when you become a victim of identity theft is not the 
money that you lose directly through the misuse of your credit card 
and your identity, but rather the damage that occurs to your credit 
report, where unauthorized charges may appear and affect your 
ability to obtain credit in the future. To protect your credit report, it’s 
critical that you monitor your monthly credit card statement carefully

for unauthorized charges. The 
sooner you notice a problem, the 
easier it will be to put a stop to the 
crime and ﬁ x your credit.
When you use a debit card, you’re 
even more vulnerable than when 
you use a credit card. Although a 
debit card looks like a regular credit 
card issued by MasterCard or Visa, 
it provides immediate access to your checking account. In addition, 
federal law does not provide the same $50 limit for unauthorized 
charges. If you’re not careful, you can have your entire checking 
account emptied without legal recourse if you’re tardy in reporting 
the misuse of your debit card.
Having your card skimmed at an ATM can lead to a fraud that skims 
more than the surface of your bank account. ATMs are a wonderful, 
modern convenience that we’ve all grown dependent on. Using an 
ATM is a quick and easy way to access your bank account for some 
quick cash. Unfortunately, using an ATM can also be a quick and 
easy way for scammers to steal your money right out of your account 
by using a skimmer and a camera. A small skimmer is attached by 
the scammer to the ATM where you insert your card. The skimmer 
then reads the information on your card as you insert it into the 
ATM. Meanwhile, a camera—which may even appear to be a security 
camera—installed at the location of the ATM looks over your shoulder 
and observes your PIN as you enter it into the ATM.
Armed with the information gathered from the skimmer and the 
camera, the thieves can create a duplicate card with your information 
and use it along with your PIN to access the money in your account.
The truth is, to avoid being victimized by this scam, you should 
always carefully observe any ATM you use for evidence of tampering 
or anything else that appears 
unusual in the machine itself, 
particularly in the card-insert area. 
And always shield the keyboard as 
you enter your PIN.

The Lebanese Loop
Another ATM scam is commonly known as the Lebanese Loop. The 
way this scam works is that when the victim inserts his card into the 
ATM, it fails to register when he enters his PIN. After repeatedly and 
unsuccessfully inserting his PIN, the victim usually leaves, assuming 
that the machine has swallowed the ATM card, which the machine 
didn’t return after being inserted.
Sometimes there’s a sign on the ATM informing the victim that it’s 
necessary to enter your PIN three times; other times there may be a 
“helpful” stranger nearby who says that he had the same problem 
with this machine not registering his PIN until he entered it three 
times. Many victims are quite willing to accept the help of this good 
Samaritan and follow his advice, but they’re disappointed when the 
ATM still doesn’t permit their account to be reached, nor does the 
machine return the card.
The truth is, a scammer has previously altered the particular ATM 
machine by inserting into the card slot a thin plastic sleeve that 
disables the ATM from being able to read your card when you put 
it into the ATM. There’s nothing particularly magical or signiﬁ cant 
about the number of times that you enter your PIN. What is signiﬁ cant 
is that by entering your PIN multiple times, it gives the scammer 
standing by you at the ATM multiple times to “shoulder surf” and 
note your PIN as you repeatedly try to access your account. Once 
you’ve given up and left the ATM, the thief pulls out the plastic sleeve 
and, now armed with both your ATM card and your PIN, can get into 
your account and steal your money.
So, what can you do to protect yourself from this type of scam? 
Always make sure that no one (or no well-positioned camera) can 
observe your PIN as you enter it. Also, you should be wary of any 
signs around the ATM that provide instructions for use of the machine 
that appear to be out of the ordinary. You also might want to get into 
the habit of carefully inspecting the card insert mechanism whenever 
you insert your card to make sure that it hasn’t been tampered with, 
either by a Lebanese Loop or a skimmer.

131
One more thing. If you ever do 
have your card eaten by an ATM 
machine and not returned to you, 
you may receive a telephone call 
purportedly from the police or bank 
security telling you that they’ve 
recovered your card but need your 
PIN for conﬁ rmation purposes. Don’t 
give the caller that information. The 
call is not from the police or bank 
security. The call is from a scammer 
who wasn’t quick enough to get 
your PIN when you were originally 
scammed and is now using this new tactic to get your PIN 
that will provide him with access to your account.

Free credit report

134
Everyone can obtain a copy of their credit report 
free once a year from each of the three major credit-
reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. 
You can order your free credit reports online at https://www.
annualcreditreport.com or by phone at 1-877-322-8228. You 
can also mail an Annual Credit Report Request Form, which 
you may obtain at the FTC’s Web site of www.ftc.gov, to Annual 
Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, Georgia 
30348-5281.
Making sure your credit report is accurate is important for many 
reasons, but it’s particularly helpful to alert you if you have become a 
victim of identity theft. Many people don’t learn that they’ve become 
a victim of identity theft until they check their credit report and see 
accounts that they never authorized that are either outstanding or in 
collection.
As always, be alert; there are a 
number of companies with names 
and Web sites that are similar to the 
ofﬁ cial Web site that you may obtain 
your free credit reports from but 
that will charge you for their services 
after a free trial period ends. Some 
of these Web sites have names 
that contain common misspellings 
or typographical errors that might 
easily be typed by someone seeking 
the real free credit report Web site. If 
you sign up for a “free” credit report 
through any of these services, you 
may also be obligating yourself to 
additional services that you may not need or want to buy. Often these 
involve getting your initial credit report free, but unwittingly signing 
up for a continuing costly credit monitoring service. Buried in the ﬁ ne 
print are the dirty details as to additional services that you may be 
obligating yourself to if you sign up with one of these “free” services. 
A typical scam provides your free credit report with an additional 
30 days of free credit monitoring; however, unless you have the eyes 
of an eagle, you may miss the ﬁ ne print that tells you that unless

you notify the company promptly within those 30 days that you 
wish to cancel the contract for future credit monitoring services, 
you’re hooked into a long-term contract that is anything but free. 
Unfortunately, as misleading as the tactics of these companies might 
be, technically they may be acting legally.
Credit monitoring services are of dubious value in any event. Prior 
to authorizing a major purchase on credit, a merchant will check the 
purchaser’s credit report to ensure that the person is creditworthy. 
Even if an identity thief obtained your Social Security number or 
other important identifying information, if your credit report was 
kept secure by the credit reporting agencies so that access to the 
report was only permitted when you, and not an identity thief, had 
authorized access, the effects of the identity theft could be greatly 
reduced. However, rather than meet their responsibility to keep 
this information secure, the major credit reporting agencies offer to 
sell you credit monitoring services and notify you of any unusual or 
suspicious activity. The problem with this approach is that the credit 
reporting agencies inform you of a problem after the problem has 
occurred rather than help prevent the problem. It is as if you were hit 
by a truck while crossing the street and someone came over to you 
while you were lying in the highway to tell you that you had just been 
hit by a truck. I would much rather have someone warn me before 
the truck hit me. If credit reporting agencies instituted better security 
policies and supported universal credit freeze legislation, there would 
be less unauthorized access to our credit reports. The truth is, the 
actions and inaction of the major credit reporting agencies contribute 
to a problem for you, which they, for a fee, then offer to help solve by 
providing you with credit monitoring services of questionable value.
TIP When a credit reporting agency signs you up for this “free” 
credit report, it may tell you that it needs your credit card 
number merely to establish your account or verify who you are. 
The truth is, the purpose of getting your credit card number is 
solely to charge you for future services as soon as the initial 
30-day period has ended. A good piece of advice is never to use 
your credit card to pay for something that is supposed to be 
free.

to the FTC Web site (www.ftc.gov) and click on the link to a free credit 
report to make sure you’re going to the truly free ofﬁ cial Web site.
Many people who have taken to heart my message about not 
providing personal identiﬁ cation information except in the most 
limited of circumstances are concerned when they are required to 
provide personal information including their Social Security number 
and birth date to get free credit reports. However, with the major 
warning that you must be sure that you’re giving this information to 
the proper entity to obtain your free credit reports, this information 
is needed to obtain your free credit report, and you shouldn’t be 
worried that this is a scam.
TIP Although you may obtain a free copy of your credit report from 
each of the three major credit reporting agencies once each 12 
months, you don’t need to do them all at the same time. A good 
habit to get into is to request your credit report from one of the 
credit reporting agencies and then four months later request 
one from another credit reporting agency and eight months 
later request one from the last remaining credit reporting 
agency so that you‘re reviewing your credit reports every four 
months for free.
Free credit reports and identity theft
Another scam occurs when criminals lure you to a Web site that 
appears to offer access to your free credit report but instead takes the 
identifying information you provide under the guise of assisting you 
in obtaining your free credit report and uses it to steal your identity.
So how can you tell if you’re being scammed by an offer of a free 
credit report? First, check for misspellings and poor grammar in the 
email message from anyone soliciting you to obtain a free credit 
report through their services. It’s been said that no generalization is 
worth a damn—including this one—but it does quite often appear 
that criminals don’t proofread their copy and don’t pay particular 
attention to their grammar. The connection between criminals 
and bad grammar may not be deﬁ nitive, but it does appear to be 
real. Perhaps junior high school English teachers are in some way 
responsible for the crime wave of today.

137
Another simple test to see if the Web site you’re using to obtain 
your free credit report is legitimate is to go to www.networksolutions.
com and click on the “WHOIS” search, which indicates who actually is 
operating the particular Web site.
TIP Never use a Web site that asks for personal information that has 
no relation to conﬁ rming your identity. No one needs to know 
your PIN or credit card numbers to authenticate who you are for 
purposes of providing you with a free credit report.
Finally, a way to make sure that you’re on a secure site is to look for 
the padlock icon at the bottom of your computer screen. Also look for 
an s on the Web address following http so it reads https, 
which indicates that the data is encrypted and the site is 
secure.

Credit repair services

Vulnerable people who have gotten in over their heads 
in debt often ﬁ nd themselves desperate for a way out. 
Being in debt is a three-headed monster, because not 
only are you hounded by your creditors, but in addition, heavy 
unpaid debts will negatively affect the credit score contained in 
your credit report which, in turn, will have a negative effect on 
your ability to get a job, buy insurance, rent an apartment, buy 
a car, or get a mortgage. In their desperation, many people turn 
to fraudulent credit repair services that promise to solve all their 
problems. Unfortunately, all they may ﬁ nd is a scam that takes 
their money.
The advertisements for credit repair services are pervasive and 
persuasive. You ﬁ nd them in legitimate newspapers and magazines, 
on television, on the radio, and all over the Internet. Unfortunately, 
many of the credit repair services you read and hear about are scams. 
We should know better. Some make elaborate claims that sound too 
good to be true because they are just that. They promise to erase 
your bad credit instantly, create a new clean identity for you instantly, 
and remove bankruptcies as well as other bad credit information 
from your credit report. These are just a few of the false claims made 
by unscrupulous credit repair services to lure you to them.
The law mandates that adverse credit information remain on your 
credit report for seven years, except for bankruptcies, which are 
permitted to remain on your credit 
report for ten years. Credit repair 
services run by con artists will tell 
you that they can get rid of negative 
information on your credit report 
and give you a clean record. Legally 
they cannot. Veriﬁ ably correct 
information cannot be removed 
from your credit report until the 
applicable seven- or ten-year period 
has elapsed.
Clifton Cross double-crossed his customers through his credit 
repair company, Build-It-Fast, which promised to erase bad credit 
and obtain a new clean credit report for its customers. Cross used

a common illegal technique called ﬁ le segregation. Customers were 
told how to obtain an Employer Identiﬁ cation Number from the IRS 
by ﬁ ling a form SS-4 and then use the number to set up a new credit 
history for themselves and thereby abandon and segregate their 
bad credit history. IRS form SS-4 is properly used to get a taxpayer 
identiﬁ cation number for an employer, a trust, an estate, or other 
legitimate business. This number has the same number of digits as a 
Social Security number. Through ﬁ le segregation and using the new 
identiﬁ cation number in the place of their Social Security number, 
Cross’ customers attempted to establish clean credit reports and 
isolate their bad credit.
The truth is, ﬁ le segregation is 
illegal. Hiding a true credit history 
is illegal. Anyone who tells you 
that she can remove accurate 
information from your credit report earlier than seven years from the 
time of the reported ﬁ nancial transaction is lying to you, stealing your 
money, or inducing you to participate in a crime. Clifton 
Cross was sentenced to 49 months in federal prison for his 
illegal activities.

Credit counseling agencies

144
Legitimate credit counseling agencies can be a boon to 
people with debt or credit problems. Among their most 
important services, they provide ﬁ nancial education 
programs to help you identify the behavior that may have resulted 
in your debt problems. In many circumstances, they can negotiate 
a plan with your creditors through which your creditors may agree 
to accept reduced payments, reduced ﬁ nance charges, or even 
waived late fees. Many times they will require you to pay a single 
payment each month to the credit counseling agency, which will 
then, in turn, pay your creditors the agreed-upon amounts as part 
of a comprehensive debt repayment plan.
Such plans often take from one to four years to liquidate your 
debts. Many credit counseling agencies charge little or nothing for 
their services, while others charge small monthly maintenance fees. 
If this sounds too good to be true, you are right to be skeptical. 
However, many credit-counseling agencies are actually partially 
funded by payments from the credit card companies and other 
creditors. These payments from 
the credit card companies and 
other creditors are called fair share 
payments and represent a classic 
example of a win-win solution. 
Through such a plan, the creditors 
can help support an industry (the 
credit counseling agencies) that 
helps the credit card companies 
receive a larger portion of their outstanding credit card debt than if 
the consumers went bankrupt or if the debts became uncollectible 
while, at the same time, reducing the amount of the debt that the 
consumer has to pay. Originally, the fair share payments to the 
credit counseling agencies averaged between 12 and 15 percent for 
managing a debt management plan; however, in recent years, these 
payments have been reduced to an average of 6 percent.
Unfortunately, giving an industry that does good work a bad name 
are a large number of scam credit counseling agencies that hide 
behind tax-exempt status and have little interest in helping you ﬁ x 
your credit but are quite interested in getting some of your money 
while your debt and credit problems continue to grow.
Such plans often 
take from one 
to four years to 
liquidate your 
debts.

145
So how do you tell the good guys from the bad guys in this 
industry? If an agency wants a large initial payment before it does 
anything for you, that is your signal to walk out the door. Federal law 
mandates that you are not required to pay a credit repair service until 
its work has been completed.
If an agency suggests that you 
apply for an Employer Identiﬁ cation 
Number to establish a new clean 
credit history, just say no. That is the 
ﬁ rst step in ﬁ le segregation, and it’s 
illegal.
If your ﬁ rst payment goes to the 
credit-counseling agency instead of 
your creditors, this is a good sign 
that it’s a bad company.
Finally, if the agency’s solution for everyone is a consolidation 
loan, beware. Credit counseling scams often involve being referred 
to another company they control that will lend you money to 
consolidate your debts when such a loan is unwarranted.
How to pick a credit counseling agency
Comparison shop. Smokey Robinson was right: “You better shop 
around.”
Check out a few agencies and don’t provide any personal 
ﬁ nancial information before you determine which agency you 
wish to use.
Only consider credit-counseling agencies that are afﬁ liated 
with the National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC) or 
the Association of Independent Consumer Credit Counseling 
Agencies (AICCCA). These are legitimate companies that adhere 
to ethical standards.
Investigate whether the company you’re considering has any 
complaints against it with your state’s Attorney General’s 
consumer protection division as well as the Federal Trade 
Commission.

Credit card rate reduction 
scam

148
Would you be enticed by a telephone call purportedly 
from someone connected to your credit card company 
telling you that he could help you reduce the interest 
rate on your credit card to as low as 4.75 percent? Many people 
are.
And why not? If you have caller ID, the call appears to be from your 
credit card company. The cost for this service is generally hundreds 
of dollars that, you are told, will be totally refunded if the promised 
credit card interest rate reductions are not obtained. So what is there 
to lose? Upon sending the company the initial money, you receive a 
form to ﬁ ll out that requests information about your credit cards and 
other debts as well as requesting your Social Security number and 
other identifying personal information.
Once the scammer receives the information, minimal services are 
provided to the extent of a three-way telephone conference call with 
you, the scammer, and your credit card company, during which a 
lowered interest rate is requested. Although this request generally is 
denied, you don’t receive the promised refunds of the fees you paid 
for this service.
The particular scam I am describing originated in Canada and was 
shut down by the FTC. The scammer used technology that permitted 
it to have its initial calls to its victims appear to be coming from the 
victim’s credit card company. This is called caller ID spooﬁ ng, and 
it’s a reason that you can’t trust your caller ID to be a totally effective 
fraud screener. Although credit card companies have the ability to 
reduce credit card rates for individual cardholders, it’s an ability 
that they rarely exercise, and only then in unusually compelling 
circumstances. You should always be wary of anyone who promises 
that he can get your credit card interest rate lowered. If you receive 
a cold call from someone saying that he is afﬁ liated with your credit 
card company offering assistance in lowering your credit card interest 
rate, you should dismiss the call out of hand. Credit card companies 
don’t operate in this fashion. If you want to check into it further, you 
can contact your credit card company’s customer service 
people at the genuine telephone number found on your 
monthly statement.

Advance fee credit cards

150
Getting by in our society without a credit card is 
difﬁ cult. Have you ever tried to pay for a rental car or 
make a hotel reservation without one? But getting a 
credit card may be difﬁ cult for people who have a bad credit 
history or a bankruptcy.
Preying upon people who are desperate to get a credit card are 
scammers who place advertisements in legitimate newspapers and 
send out mass mailings offering credit cards with credit limits of as 
much as $7,500 regardless of your credit history. All you need to do 
is pay a processing fee, which may be anywhere from $50 to $90. 
The names of the companies offering these credit cards sound like 
companies you’re familiar with, 
but having a name that sounds 
legitimate is just part of the scam. 
Legitimate credit card companies 
don’t charge you a processing 
fee for a credit card under any 
circumstances until you’re actually 
approved for the particular card. In 
fact, what you may receive from the 
scammer for your processing fee 
is no credit card at all, but merely 
a list of banks that offer credit 
cards. None of these banks have 
any relation with the scammer. 
The payment that you made to the 
scammer does not in the slightest way make it any more likely that 
any of these banks will offer you a credit card. But that is not even 
the worst of it. Other conmen working a variation of this same scam 
merely take your money for the processing fee and send you nothing 
at all. And, worst of all, you become a potential victim of identity theft 
by providing your personal information to the scammer.
Another form of advance fee credit card fraud occurs when people 
are scammed into believing that they are being sold a regular 
credit card, but ﬁ nd out that what they are actually sold is a credit 
card whose use is limited to purchasing merchandise contained in 
catalogues issued by the same company selling you the card. The 
cost of the credit card is usually a couple of hundred dollars. And, to 
Legitimate credit 
card companies 
don’t charge you a 
processing fee for 
a credit card under 
any circumstances 
until you’re 
actually approved 
for the particular 
card.

151
make matters worse, often the products that you can buy through 
the catalogue are more expensive than you would be charged if you 
bought the items elsewhere. Compounding the fraud even further 
are the fees you’re charged for this worthless credit card. The initial 
activation fee is just the beginning of the fees you pay. People 
buying these cards, which appear to be no-interest credit cards with 
credit limits of up to $8,000, soon ﬁ nd that in addition to the initial 
“activation fee,” they’re charged a host of other fees automatically 
unless they cancel the card immediately.
The scammers who sell these cards represent that they help you to 
establish a credit history that will be reported to the credit reporting 
agencies and assist you in improving your all-important credit score 
maintained by the credit reporting bureaus that can affect whether 
you get a job, insurance, an apartment, or a loan. The truth is, there 
are much less costly ways to improve your credit score without using 
an advance fee “credit” card. Moreover, many of the purchases made 
through the card are not even reported to all of the credit bureaus.
Advance fee credit cards are 
a sucker bet. You are better off 
obtaining a secured credit card 
if your credit makes it difﬁ cult to 
obtain a conventional credit card. 
A secured credit card is one issued 
by a legitimate bank—even if you 
have bad credit—if you establish 
a bank account that will serve 
as collateral for your credit card 
purchases. Through the responsible 
use of a secured credit card, you 
can establish your credit until your 
credit score is sufﬁ cient to enable 
you to obtain a conventional unsecured credit card. It’s important 
to be a prudent consumer when applying for a secured credit card. 
The fees can vary greatly from bank to bank. If you’re a member of a 
credit union, you might get a secured credit card there at a 
reduced cost. For a list of banks that offer secured 
credit cards and the fees that they charge, go to

Radio frequency cards

“Instant gratiﬁ cation takes too long” was a great line 
uttered by Meryl Streep in the 1990 movie Postcards 
from the Edge.
Apparently, the credit card companies have adopted this as their 
motto. It just takes so damn long to process a credit card purchase. 
And then there is that interminable time it takes to sign a credit 
card slip. So, utilizing the latest technology, they have come up with 
credit cards embedded with radio-
frequency tags. Now all you have to 
do is merely wave your credit card 
in front of a scanner. No swiping 
your credit card through a machine, 
no signature, no muss, no fuss. 
And no security. That’s because 
identity thieves, also using the latest 
technology, can take the information 
off of your radio frequency credit 
card with their own scanner and 
start charging things in your name. 
The credit card companies will tell 
you that the information on your 
card is encrypted so that someone 
without the proper decoding device 
cannot lift it. They also will tell you that you can keep your credit card 
in a safe holder that will block access to the information on 
your card. But are the milliseconds saved really worth the 
added risk to your security?

Work-at-home schemes
“They were a people so primitive they 
did not know how to get money, except by 
working for it.”
—Joseph Addison

156
Like many cons, this one appeals to us on many levels. 
You get to work at home. Your commute is from your 
bedroom to your computer. The work is easy. It requires 
no skill. Your time is your own and, best of all, you make lots of 
money. All you need to do is get “the word” from the promoter of 
the scam.
One of the most common types of 
these is a “work-at-home” scheme 
where you merely stuff envelopes. 
And just what are you stufﬁ ng into 
those envelopes? The truth is, often 
you’re sending out information on 
the same work-at-home envelope 
stufﬁ ng business that you’re doing. 
There’s no money in stufﬁ ng 
envelopes at home. The only money 
made in envelope stufﬁ ng is by the 
scammers who con you out of your 
money and lure you into this scam.
Work at home—medical billing
We all know how complex the health care system is in this country. 
Advertisements in legitimate newspapers and magazines tell you 
that medical billing by physicians is a huge business and that little 
of it is done electronically. In fact, the medical industry is lagging 
behind much of the business world in its use of electronic billing 
and information transmittal. It seems reasonable when we’re told 
that with so much money involved in processing medical bills and 
insurance bills, there’s money to be made by enterprising people. 
We’re then told that many physicians don’t want to spend their 
time or their staff’s time doing this important billing task. We’re told 
that they wish to send out this work to others to do for them. And 
that’s where you come in. Armed with the proper software, some 
instruction, and a list of interested physician-prospects, you’re 
promised by the scammer that you’ll rapidly be in a position to make 
large amounts of money doing medical billing and administrative 
services in the medical ﬁ eld. The cost of this package to put you in

business can range from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand

This scam is operated by many different people and continues to 
ﬂ ourish despite convictions for fraud such as those of the people 
involved in such a scam under the names Data Medical Capital, Data-
Jed, and Medco.
The truth is, the medical billing business is a complex, competitive 
one that’s difﬁ cult to get into, particularly without experience. 
Medical billing involves extensive 
knowledge of the ever-changing 
code system used by insurers to 
designate various procedures. 
The training you receive from the 
scammers is worthless. The software 
program you receive is marked up 
in price tremendously from what 
it would cost you to buy the same 
software at any computer store, and 
it may not even be the software you 
need. As to the list of physicians 
just waiting for you to call, the list 
is just a compilation of names of 
physicians, none of whom are likely 
to be interested in your services.
The advertisements for these 
scams appear in many legitimate 
sources, but don’t take the fact that 
such an advertisement appears in a 
newspaper or magazine that you trust as an endorsement 
of that particular publication. The truth is, it’s not.

What could be easier? Get paid for giving your opinion? 
Get paid to shop? Get paid for going to dinner at great 
restaurants? Unfortunately, it’s not quite what it appears.
Although there are legitimate companies that will pay people to 
perform market surveys, the pay is hardly great for the time involved, 
and the work is far from steady. Scammers count on your willingness 
to be conned and tell you that by signing up for their program, you 
will be paid considerable money for giving your opinion of the retail 
experience at a particular store, eating at a particular restaurant 
or, without having to even leave your home, just taking a survey. 
However, what you end up doing when you join these programs is 
paying more for your membership than you will ever earn. Or worse. 
These companies might also be planting viruses on your computer, 
stealing money from your credit card, or making you susceptible to 
identity theft.
Another variation on the mystery shopper scam occurs when you 
receive a letter informing you that you’ve been chosen as a mystery 
shopper to do product and marketing research for companies you’re 
familiar with, such as Wal-Mart or McDonalds. When you join the 
program, you’re sent a cashier’s check for thousands of dollars and 
instructed to make purchases with the money and evaluate the 
products. You even get to keep the products. What a deal! However, 
the check is always for more than 
the amount of your purchases, so 
after your fee is taken out, you’re 
instructed to wire the balance of 
the money by Western Union back 
to the mystery shopping company. 
By now, you should have guessed 
that the cashier’s check is as 
phony as a crocodile’s smile. You 
end up wiring your own money to 
the scammer without any effective 
legal recourse to get it back.
Anytime you’re asked to wire money, a bell should go off 
in your mind, because wiring money is a quick way to 
empty your account without the legal protections that come 
with paying by a check that you could stop payment on.

Check cashing scam
You made the mistake of answering an enticing 
email that tells you how you can make money quickly 
and easily. Now you’re in the business of transferring funds 
internationally.
How this works is money is sent to you by check, wire transfers, 
or even certiﬁ ed checks. You, in turn, are told to deposit the money 
in your account and then send the money back to the person you’re 
dealing with, while keeping a small percentage of the money for 
yourself. What could be easier? But why do they need you? You’re 
told that your role is important to 
avoid various international fees and 
taxes. So you deposit the money 
in your account and send back the 
money minus your commission. It’s 
only later that you learn that the 
check deposited in your account 
bounces, and you’re on the hook 
for the money you paid back. Think

We’ve all heard stories of disgruntled postal workers who have

But why don’t we hear more about all the “gruntled” postal workers? 
Apparently there are many of these contented workers, because their 
jobs seem to be in such great demand. Jobs with the United States 
Postal Service are in such demand that scammers see this as an 
opportunity to separate people from their money regardless of rain, 
snow, or gloom of night.
Victims of one scam responded to advertisements informing them

that there were jobs available in 
their area of the country, but they 
would need to pass an examination 
that would guarantee them a 
job. The company placing the 
advertisement told them that, for a 
fee, they would help them register 
for a job opening with the postal 
service as well as provide them 
with material that would enable 
them to get a score of at least 90 
on the examination, which would ensure them a job with the post 
ofﬁ ce. Sounds good. Too bad it wasn’t true. Like many scams, there 
is just a kernel of truth to this one. It’s true that examinations are 
required for many entry-level positions with the United States Postal 
Service. However, the tests are not offered every year. It’s also true 
that if an applicant achieves a score of at least 70 on the exam, he’s 
placed on a register for when postal jobs do become available. When 
a job becomes available, the local post ofﬁ ce looks to the register 
for that particular geographic location and interviews the top three 
applicants. However, the truth is, the score that the applicant gets on 
the legitimate examination is only one factor in determining whether 
an applicant gets the job. And the exam itself is an aptitude 
test. It’s not the kind of test in which you stand a good 
chance of improving your score through any kind of study.

Cruise ship employment

What could be better than working on a cruise ship, 
spending your winters in the Caribbean and your 
summers in Alaska? What’s not to love?
This promise has been enticing to many people who have respond-
ed to advertisements in legitimate newspapers looking for people 
to work on a cruise ship. When you respond to the advertisement by 
telephone, you get to do your interview online. The job is described 
to you in great detail, as is the pay and beneﬁ ts package. It looks like 
a great deal. You just need to send the agency your Social Security 
number and $150 to cover the cost of your uniform.
The truth is, the whole thing is a scam. And not only have you 
lost $150 or whatever the scammer charged you for uniforms, an 
application fee, or a security investigation charge, but you’re also 
in serious danger of becoming a victim of identity theft because 
you’ve provided your Social Security number as well as perhaps other 
personal identifying information.
The ﬁ rst warning should go off in your mind whenever an advance 
payment is required before you start work for a company. Advance 
payments are extremely unusual for legitimate companies and par for 
the course with scammers. Never wire money to anyone whom you’re 
not absolutely positive is legitimate. Once you’ve wired money, it’s 
gone. If you later ﬁ nd out the whole thing was a scam, you’ve lost the

something you want to pursue, check out the speciﬁ c company with 
the Better Business Bureau, the Federal Trade Commission, and your

indeed legitimate. Even then, call them back at a telephone number 
that you know is an actual number for the legitimate company they 
purport to be to conﬁ rm that the offer is legitimate. And remember,

The convenience of posting a resume online with 
an online employment service is tremendous. In 
addition to the convenience, you get the advantage of 
having your resume available to a large number of prospective 
employers. Unfortunately, your resume may also be available to a 
large number of scammers.
A common scam occurs when someone posing as a job recruiter 
for a legitimate company contacts you. He tells you that he’s 
impressed with your resume, but that before the company can 
schedule an interview with you, it needs to do a background check on 
you. To do that, it needs some personal identifying information from 
you, including your Social Security number.
Your Social Security number is the key to identity theft in the hands 
of a scammer. You should never provide your Social Security number 
or other sensitive information to a recruiter or employer until you’ve 
met with him in person at his ofﬁ ce during normal working hours. 
Personally meeting someone in this 
way can help you conﬁ rm that she 
works for a legitimate company. You 
can also check out the legitimacy of 
a prospective employer through the 
Better Business Bureau.
Never provide information in 
an online resume that can be 
manipulated into identity theft. 
Don’t list your Social Security number, your birth date, your 
home address, or your telephone number. Even as to your 
name, it’s prudent to use only your ﬁ rst initial and your last 
name.

Home sweet scam
“If stupidity got us into this mess, 
then why can’t it get us out?”
—Will Rogers

170
For many people, the biggest investment they will ever 
make during their lifetime is the purchase of a home. 
Because real estate is so valuable, it is a prime target 
for scammers.
One scam involves your being 
approached by a person who tells 
you that although he’s a reputable 
real estate investor, he can’t get 
conventional ﬁ nancing from local 
banks because banks are too 
conservative in their underwriting 
standards and they consider him 
to have too many loans in place 
even though he’s a successful 
businessman operating a proﬁ table 
business. But he has a win-win 
solution to his problem—one that 
will help him and help you at the 
same time. He will use your good 
name and credit to buy a piece 
of property. You get a couple of 
thousand dollars merely for letting him use your name to buy the 
property and obtain a mortgage. You have nothing to lose because 
he will pay all of the closing costs as well as ﬁ nd a tenant to pay the 
cost of the mortgage and other carrying costs. He also tells you that 
after about a year, he will “ﬂ ip” the property and sell it for a tidy proﬁ t 
that he will share with you. Sounds good? It isn’t.
The truth is, although in some instances these straw buyers who 
lent their name and credit to such transactions actually did get 
paid, in many instances, the people who provided their name and 
credit ended up in foreclosure and even personal bankruptcy as the 
banks came after the straw buyers, not just for the property, but also 
for any amounts left owing the bank after a foreclosure auction of 
the property. Often the mortgage amounts were particularly large 
because the scammer provided illegitimate, inﬂ ated appraisals of 
the properties to get more money out of the scam. Elderly people 
on ﬁ xed incomes but with a lifetime of good credit have been prime 
targets for this kind of fraud.
For many people, 
the biggest 
investment they 
will ever make 
during their 
lifetime is the 
purchase of a 
home. Because 
real estate is so 
valuable, it is a 
prime target for 
scammers.

Everyone should avoid deals like 
this. Again, Mom was right. Don’t 
take candy from strangers. No 
matter how sweet the deal sounds, 
you’re safer avoiding real estate 
transactions unless you’re a real 
estate professional. Never falsify 
documents, and never go into 
business with someone that you 
don’t know extremely well. If you 
even consider such a proposition, 
check out the banking references of 
the person offering the deal to you. Get his credit report. Check local 
courts for lawsuits. Check with the consumer protection division of 
your state’s Attorney General’s ofﬁ ce for complaints as well.
I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll blow your house 
down
He wasn’t called the big, bad wolf for nothing. Scammers are out 
there who can do more damage to your home and your ﬁ nances than 
the big, bad wolf could ever do. A scam that often preys in particular 
on elderly homeowners involves the scammer obtaining information 
from public records as to who owns homes with no mortgages left 
on them. Often this is an elderly homeowner whose home not only 
is mortgage-free, but whose home also may have substantially 
appreciated in value since the homeowner ﬁ rst bought the home. 
It’s relatively easy for a scammer to forge your signature on a deed 
to himself and then forge a notarization of your signature. There’s no 
regulation that requires anyone to provide evidence that he’s indeed 
a notary public before obtaining a notary seal. Once the title appears 
to be in the scammer’s name, he can then get a large amount of 
money through a mortgage loan secured by your home and never 
make a single mortgage payment. Fortunately, your home can’t be 
taken away from you by a forged deed, and you won’t owe money 
on a loan taken out by the scammer, but you’re in trouble anyway 
because you’ll be compelled to expend considerable time, effort, 
and legal fees to clear the title to your home, ﬁ x the damage to your 
credit, and prove the true state of affairs.

Foreclosure fraud
Financial vulnerability makes people more susceptible 
to being defrauded. In the wild, predators seek out 
the weakest and most vulnerable animals for the kill; so do the 
predators in the “civilized” world.
Mortgage foreclosures are increasing throughout the country. Many 
people took out adjustable rate mortgages and home equity loans 
when interest rates were low and property prices high, thinking the 
bubble would never burst. But it always does. So now that prices in 
many places have ﬂ attened or even gone down and interest rates 
have increased, many homeowners are facing foreclosure as they 
ﬁ nd themselves unable to make their mortgage payments. These are 
desperate times for these people and unfortunately, many of them 
consider that desperate times call for desperate measures. This may 
mean becoming more susceptible to the claims of scam artists who 
tell these people what they want to 
hear, namely that the scam artist will 
come to their rescue by taking over 
their mortgage and paying their loan 
for them while renting their property.
The truth is, scammers know 
that it can take as long as a year 
from the time that a mortgage 
ﬁ rst is in arrears and a foreclosure 
proceeding is begun before the 
home is actually auctioned off. This 
gives the scammer ample time to 
rent the house and pocket the rent 
without paying the bank anything.

ﬁ nancial problems.
It’s never over till it’s over
Regardless of how wealthy you are or how smart you may think 
you are, you can easily become a victim of real estate fraud. One 
particular scam involves a wealthy buyer who is so thrilled with your 
expensive home that he gives you a full-price offer and provides 
a certiﬁ ed check for the deposit that may run into the hundreds of 
thousands of dollars. But after a couple of days, the prospective 
buyer decides that he doesn’t want the home and, in accordance 
with the terms of the Offer to Purchase, withdraws the offer and 
requests that you wire his deposit money back to him. So you do, 
and the cashier’s check that he gave you turns out to be phony, and 
you’re out all of the money that you wired to the scammer.
You should never return money 
for anything that you’re in the 
process of selling until the check 
to you has actually cleared. Just 
because it looks like a cashier’s 
check or bank check doesn’t make 
it one.
Reverse mortgages
A reverse mortgage is the name 
for a loan that uses your home 
as security for a loan, just 
like a conventional mortgage 
arrangement that we’re all 
familiar with. However, unlike a 
conventional mortgage, with a 
reverse mortgage you generally 
don’t have to pay back the loan for 
as long as you live in the home. This allows people to take the equity 
out of their home and turn it into cash to meet their daily needs 
without having to be concerned about making monthly payments. 
Repayment of the loan with interest is generally done when the 
borrower sells the home, moves out of the home, or dies, whichever 
ﬁ rst occurs. For many house-rich, but cash-poor seniors, this might

seem to be a great solution to their ﬁ nancial concerns. There are 
many different types of reverse mortgages and a large number of 
fees involved in obtaining a reverse mortgage. A reverse mortgage is 
an expensive way to borrow money. However, it can be particularly 
expensive if you are conned out of money in the process of obtaining 
a reverse mortgage.
Taking advantage of the public’s interest in reverse mortgages 
coupled with the public’s lack of knowledge about reverse 
mortgages, scammers have “counseled” people interested in 
reverse mortgages by providing them with information about reverse 
mortgages and where they may obtain one. For this information 
and “counseling,” often provided under the guise of estate planning 
services, they charge unwary seniors a fee of between 6 and 
10 percent of the money ultimately borrowed through a reverse 
mortgage. Once the unwary elderly homeowner has signed up with 
the scammer, the homeowner gets little in return for the money 
he pays the scammer. Many times the scammer merely provides 
the homeowner with the name of a ﬁ nancial institution that deals 
in reverse mortgages. Sometimes the scammer accompanies the 
homeowner to a counseling session with a HUD-approved counseling 
agency that is required as a condition of obtaining a HUD-approved 
reverse mortgage. HUD has issued 
a directive to reverse mortgage 
lenders to stop doing business with 
these scammers. The information 
provided by the scammer for which 
a senior may pay thousands of 
dollars is available absolutely free 
from the Department of Housing

are both expensive and exceedingly

Pump and dump
We’ve all received emails that contained glowing 
recommendations of a particular stock, or perhaps 
you’ve learned on an Internet forum about a particular “steal” of 
a stock that’s about to take off. Or maybe you even received an 
email intended for someone else giving you “inside” information 
about a particular small company stock that is about to rocket to 
high proﬁ ts on the stock market. Just ask Martha Stewart. It’s not 
a good thing.
When you get this email or pick up this information, it looks so 
harmless and appears to be such an easy way to make a big buck 
that the temptation may be great. The companies involved in this 
scam are actual companies, but with such small capitalization that 
they aren’t even required to ﬁ le reports with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, so it’s difﬁ cult to ﬁ nd good information 
you can rely on to check out the validity of the tip you receive. If 
you fall for this scam, you buy the stock, and the stock price soars 
quickly but plummets just as quickly. The truth is, the original tip 
you received was sent to a large 
number of people merely to inﬂ ate 
the value of the stock by creating 
a demand. As soon as the suckers 
have momentarily shot the price of 
the stock up, the scammers dump 
the stock they bought when it was 
cheap and vanish with their proﬁ ts 
while you’re left with a worthless 
stock and a lesson in greed.
Churning
Churning is the name given to the practice by unethical stockbrokers 
of making excessive trades of stocks for accounts that they manage 
on behalf of investors. The reason behind these excessive trades is 
not to maximize your proﬁ ts as an investor, but rather to generate 
more fees for the broker, who gets a commission every time a sale 
occurs in your account. For this reason, it rarely makes sense to give 
your stockbroker the authority to trade whenever he wants. And

burned by having their accounts

their accounts are being turned 
over frequently because they 
consider the monthly statements 
too complicated. They’re afraid 
that they wouldn’t understand the

you didn’t authorize or even just an unusually high level of

Promissory notes
Corporations legitimately issue promissory notes as 
a way to raise money to operate their businesses. 
Through a promissory note, a corporation borrows money from 
the purchaser of the note and agrees to pay interest on the money 
borrowed. The loans are paid back over a period of months or 
even years.
Even legitimate promissory notes are far from a sure thing. If the 
company borrowing the money comes upon hard times, the lender 
may not be paid. In any event, genuine corporate promissory notes 
are rarely available to anyone 
other than large corporate lenders 
and sophisticated, experienced 
investors. But this doesn’t stop 
scammers from marketing to the 
general public promissory notes 
issued by companies that are 
either not well known or, in some 
instances, don’t even exist. The 
promise is that you can get as 
much as a 15 percent monthly 
return on the money you lend 
these companies. Many times 
the promissory notes come 
with a worthless guarantee or 
representations that they are 
secured loans, which they aren’t. The 
promissory notes are sold by sales 
people, who are often insurance 
agents, as being a safe investment. 
Often the insurance agents 
themselves are not aware that this is 
a scam, but they too may be blinded by their own greed and the high 
commissions paid by the promoter of the scam. All too often, the 
only thing you can safely count on is that you will lose money when 
the company fails to pay you back the money loaned through the 
promissory note.

2. Check with your own state’s securities regulator to see if the

issuing the notes is said to be headquartered for any complaints 
against the company and to see if it is legitimate.
Prime bank schemes
In this scam, investors are promised huge returns on their 
investments by being let in on the “secret” investments used by 
some of the wealthiest people in the world, namely access to the 
investment portfolios of the world’s most elite or prime banks. The

A step up from the smaller 
fraud of promissory notes is the 
more complex fraud perpetrated 
by scammers selling prime 
bank ﬁ nancial instruments. Like

these investments promise big 
returns that never materialize. At

told that the entire transaction must be kept secret; therefore, no 
references may be supplied to you. You’re told that indeed these 
Prime Bank investments are the best-kept secret in the world of

International Monetary Fund. You may be told that only select 
banks and a few privileged investors are permitted access to these 
investment programs. In fact, you’re required to ofﬁ cially participate 
in this cloak of secrecy by signing a nondisclosure agreement. You’re 
even told with a wink that this program is so secret that federal 
regulatory agencies will deny its existence. This certainly helps the 
scammer when it comes to perpetrating a fraud. Lucky you to be 
able to join the elite group of people invited to participate in this 
investment. Sometimes to make the fraud seem more legitimate 
and appeal to you on yet another level, the scammers tell you that 
the funds invested are used by these major international banks for 
various humanitarian purposes, and that indeed, you must agree 
to have a portion of your exorbitant proﬁ ts be used for whatever 
particular humanitarian purpose the scammer tells you is the basis 
for the particular investment program.
The truth is, there are no such 
investment programs. They’re a total 
scam. A tip-off is the fact that, unlike 
any other investment, you won’t 
be able to ﬁ nd any independent 
information about the investment 
that you’re asked to put your money

Viatical companies
A viatical settlement company buys life insurance 
policies from policyholders while the policyholder 
is still living. The company then makes itself the beneﬁ ciary 
of the policy and continues to pay the premiums. The viatical 
settlement company makes a lump-sum payment to the original 
policyholder, who can use the money for long-term care needs, 
medical needs, or whatever he wants.
The development of the viatical settlement industry was spurred 
on by the AIDS epidemic, when sick people sold their policies 
to investors for money to use while they were still alive. Viatical 
settlements offer a legitimate source of funds for someone with a 
hefty life insurance policy in force, but with few other assets to meet 
his needs while alive. Unfortunately, the viatical settlement industry 
is not well regulated, with only about half of the states regulating 
these companies. The crux of the regulation problem seems to be a 
technical one as to whether the companies should be regulated as 
insurance or investments. 
Some scammers hold “free” 
seminars at which potential 
investors are told how they can 
invest in viatical settlement 
companies. The appeal is that the 
money invested will go to help a 
sick person in dire need of cash. 
It truly appears to be a chance 
to do well while doing good.

companies, such as Mutual Beneﬁ ts

Currency trading
One of the ﬁ rst rules of investing is to only invest in things you 
know and understand. But what fun or proﬁ t is there in that? And 
who has time to actually learn about something before you invest? 
Unfortunately, people seem to prefer to invest in things that they 
don’t understand but that promise great proﬁ ts, which just makes the 
scammer’s job that much easier.
Currency trading is legal. It’s also complicated. People who watch 
media coverage in television sound bites of the world of investment 
and ﬁ nance are bombarded by information about the ﬂ uctuations in 
the value of the dollar against the Yen and other world currencies. 
Some knowledgeable investors, mostly institutional investors, do 
make money in currency trading by, in effect, betting on which 
currencies are going up in value and which are going down. It’s a 
risky high-stakes game.
But the exotic lure of getting in on some of this “easy money” with 
the promise of extraordinary high returns and low risk is too much for 
many people. They are given sales pitches at “free” seminars. They 
receive a telemarketing call. They receive emails or snail mail. The 
scammers who deal in this form of investment fraud are slick and 
persuasive. A recent hook for scammers involved in currency trading 
has been the war in Iraq. They use compelling advertising that claims 
that people “in the know” are making big proﬁ ts by buying and 
selling Iraqi currency.
This is a risky investment with rapid price swings that can wipe 
out proﬁ ts quickly even when it’s done legally. But when you’re 
investing through a scammer who may be operating the scam as a 
Ponzi deal and has little intent of doing anything other than stealing 
your money, your chances of coming out of this with a penny in your 
pocket are slight.

Variable annuities
Variable annuities are a technically legal investment 
that can easily morph into a scam. In fact, the North 
American Securities Administrators Association has called 
variable annuities one of the top ten scams of the year because 
of the failure of many salespeople to tell their customers of 
the extensive fees and charges they involve. Unscrupulous 
salespeople love variable annuities because the commissions 
are as high as 12 percent, but unwary customers, including many 
older people who are particularly unsuited for this investment, 
have come to hate them. Variable annuities are touted as being 
able to bring a greater investment return than other investments, 
but as a general rule with most investments that make that 
promise, they come with more risk.
A variable annuity is a tax-
deferred investment that has 
an insurance component and 
subaccounts made up of various 
mutual funds. It’s done as a 
contract with an insurance company 
that promises to provide regular 
payments to you in the future. The 
size of the payments depends on 
the performance of the mutual 
funds that make up the investment 
portion of the variable annuity. As 
with any investment, it’s not the 
money you make that’s important, 
but rather the money you keep. With 
a variable annuity, the money you get to keep is drastically reduced 
by the many fees involved. The fees found in a typical variable 
annuity can be quite high, particularly as they compound over time.
The Mortality and Expense Risk Charge is an annual charge that is 
usually about 1.25 percent of the value of the account. This charge 
relates to the insurance aspect of your annuity.
Variable annuities 
are one of the top 
ten scams of the 
year because of 
the failure of many 
salespeople to tell 
their customers of 
the extensive fees 
and charges they 
involve.

191
The Account Maintenance Fee is a ﬁ xed fee of about $35 per 
year that compensates the insurance company issuing the annuity 
for administration costs. However, in addition to this fee, you will 
indirectly pay the management fees of the various mutual funds that 
make up the investments contained in your annuity.
Then there are the surrender fees. Not since the days of General 
George Armstrong Custer have there been stiffer surrender fees. 
Depending on the individual annuity, taking your money out of a 
deferred variable annuity to invest in something else or merely to 
use the money can carry a surrender charge of as much as 7 percent 
of the value of the annuity. Surrender charges can exist for as long 
as ten years in some deferred variable annuities. These surrender 
charges make deferred annuities a particularly poor investment 
choice for many older Americans who may have a need to readily 
access their funds but who are often a target audience of sellers of 
variable annuities.
Sellers of variable annuities tell customers that there are income 
tax advantages to owning a variable annuity because the income you 
derive is tax deferred, like a traditional IRA. What they don’t tell you is 
that when you take money out of your variable annuity, it’s taxed at 
higher ordinary income tax rates rather than the lower capital gains 
income tax rates you would be paying for a comparable investment 
in a mutual fund. If you owned the same mutual fund both inside an 
annuity and outside an annuity, you 
would pay income taxes at the lower 
capital gains rates when you took 
the money out of your individually 
owned mutual fund, but you’d pay at 
the higher ordinary income tax rates 
when you took the money out of 
your annuity.
The truth is, most people would 
do considerably better by investing 
their money directly in the various 
mutual funds that make up the 
subaccounts of the annuity with 
fewer costs.

FEES IN LEGITIMATE INVESTMENTS
TRUTH

Mutual fund fees
Mutual funds are not only legal, but they can also be a simple way to 
get a ready-made diversiﬁ ed investment portfolio. However, the level 
of fees found in some mutual funds can turn a legal investment into 
a legal scam.
All mutual funds must disclose their fees and charges in their 
prospectuses. The prospectus must also contain a chart that 
shows the effect of the particular fund’s fees and charges on a 
$1,000 investment over one-, three-, ﬁ ve-, and ten-year periods. 
Unfortunately, most people don’t bother to read the prospectus. You 
should.
Some of the fees and charges 
that you may ﬁ nd in a mutual 
fund include front-end load fees, 
redemption fees, management fees, 
and marketing fees.
Front-end load fees are sales fees on mutual funds sold through 
a broker or ﬁ nancial planner. Often the fact that this fee is present 
is not readily discerned unless you read the prospectus. Load funds 
don’t earn more money than no-load funds that don’t charge you 
a sales commission, so unless you need the help of a broker or 
ﬁ nancial planner to choose a fund for you, you’re wasting your money 
buying a load fund.
Redemption fees are just back-end loads. They represent a fee you 
pay merely for the privilege of selling your shares in the mutual fund. 
Again, unless you read the prospectus, you may not be aware of this 
fee that can eat into your proﬁ ts.
Management fees are necessary, but they can range considerably 
from one mutual fund to another from .5 percent to 1.0 percent 
annually. In addition to this fee are charges for administrative costs 
of the fund that range from .2 percent annually to .4 percent.
But the biggest legal scam fee of all is the Mutual Fund Marketing 
Fee, or 12b-1 fee. The Securities and Exchange Commission ﬁ rst 
approved this fee in 1980 to permit the mutual fund industry, 
which was in a slowdown at the time, to pass on to its customers 
the marketing costs, such as advertising and mailing costs, for the 
Most people don’t 
bother to read the 
prospectus. You 
should.

mutual fund. With a 12b-1 fee, you 
are, in effect, each year paying 
for the mutual fund to do more 
television and print advertising. 
Even though you are already 
invested in the fund, through the 
payment of this fee, you pay for the 
continual marketing of the fund 
to others. This cash cow varies 
from mutual fund to mutual fund 
with some, such as The Vanguard Group, charging fees of just a bit 
more than 4 percent of investor’s proﬁ ts while other mutual fund 
companies have marketing fees that take almost 16 percent of your 
proﬁ ts. And what about the essential question as to why, year after 
year, you should as an investor have to pay for the marketing of the 
mutual fund company to other people.
So how do you compare the costs of different mutual funds to 
determine who is giving you the most bang for your buck and who 
has fees that might be considered by some to be a legal scam? An 
easy way to compare costs is to go to the Securities and Exchange 
Commission’s Web site www.sec.gov and use its interactive Mutual 
Fund Cost Calculator to see how different funds compare.
TIP  If you want to reﬁ ne your investment choices to the simplest 
form, you may want to choose index funds. Index mutual funds 
are an investment arrangement by which a mutual fund holds 
all the securities in a particular index. Investment guru John 
Bogle of Vanguard Funds pioneered index funds. The particular 
index may be the S&P 500, the Wilshire 5000, or any of the 
many other index funds, some of which invest in the stocks of 
foreign countries, thereby facilitating your investing in emerging 
world markets. The theory of index funds is based on the fact 
that few people, if any, “beat” the market, particularly when you 
consider the additional costs of fees. Interestingly, over the past 
15 years, index mutual funds have actually beaten 
actively managed funds by 3.4 percent. The expense 
costs for an actively managed no-load mutual fund 
may be six times that of an index fund.
With a 12b-1 fee, 
you are, in effect, 
each year paying 
for the mutual 
fund to do more 
television and print 
advertising.

Free ﬁ nancial seminars

196
Free ﬁ nancial seminars are common. Sometimes they 
are offered through mailings or advertisements in 
newspapers telling you about the investment seminar 
that will change your life. Sometimes they even provide a free 
lunch or at least coffee and doughnuts. But we all know there are 
no free lunches.
Sometimes the seminar you’re invited to has a cost for tickets 
of as much as hundreds of dollars, but because you’re “special,” 
your invitation (along with just about everyone else’s) has tickets 
to allow you to attend this costly seminar for free. At the seminar, 
you’re told how to buy real estate with no money down, how to avoid 
income taxes, how to totally protect your assets from claims of all 
those people out there who are just waiting to sue you, or how to 
buy a unique investment that only 
they are offering that can earn you 
tremendous amounts of money in 
no time at all with no risk.
The truth is, there are no free seminars. Even legitimate estate 
planning or investment seminars are not put on due to the 
goodness of the hearts of the seminar promoters. They’re done to 
gather clients. They’re done to sell you something. There are many 
legitimate “free” seminars, but scammers also put on free seminars, 
and they’re adept at luring you into an investment, tax, or ﬁ nancial 
scheme that is nothing but a fraud.
Once again, do your homework. Check on the promoter of the 
seminar with the local Better Business Bureau, the Federal Trade 
Commission at www.ftc.gov, the Securities and Exchange Commission 
at www.sec.gov, and your state’s Attorney General’s ofﬁ ce. Ignore 
any money-back guarantees that may be offered by the promoter 
of the seminar. If you don’t know the promoter, how can you trust 
his guarantee? Be wary of the second step involved in many “free” 
seminars, which is the sale of books, CDs, software, videos, and other 
information to take you to the “proﬁ table” level of their program. In 
these scams, this is just the beginning of the proﬁ table 
level for the scammer, not for you. Beware of inﬂ ated 
promises. They tend to deﬂ ate quickly, as does your wallet.
There are no free 
seminars.

PART XII: THE TRUTH ABOUT SOLUTIONS
TRUTH
58
Some solutions
“It isn’t that they can’t see the solution. 
It is that they can’t see the problem.”
—G. K. Chesterton

198
It’s difﬁ cult to totally avoid being scammed or 
becoming a victim of identity theft. But there are 
some things that you can do to lessen your chances of 
becoming a victim. Some of these things are simple, while some 
require a little bit of work on your part. Many people are lazy 
and don’t want to take these steps to protect their own security. 
These are the people that the scammers are counting on, because 
they’re the easiest victims.
Do you really want to receive those unsolicited offers of credit 
cards and insurance that not only clutter your mailbox, but also 
provide ample opportunities for identity thieves to open credit in 
your name by either stealing your mail or stealing your trash if you 
merely throw out the solicitations without shredding them? And 
while we’re on the subject, mere tearing of the solicitation or even 
straight shredding is not enough to protect you. Identity thieves often 
hire methamphetamine addicts with a predisposition to meticulous 
boring work to piece together your trash to provide a usable credit 
card offer.
You can avoid the entire problem by merely contacting the major 
credit reporting bureaus to have your name taken off the lists used to 
generate those offers. You can either call 888-567-8688 or go online 
at www.optoutprescreen.com to be removed from what the three 
credit reporting agencies—Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion—refer 
to as their prescreened offer lists. Your security will improve.
If you’ve been procrastinating taking yourself off the prescreened 
offer lists, a good time to act is when you apply for a mortgage. Once 
you apply for a mortgage, your name will be put on a “trigger list” 
maintained by the credit reporting bureaus that they sell to other 
mortgage lenders, and you’ll soon be ﬂ ooded with communications 
from other lenders. Of course, particularly after reading this book, 
you may be nervous about having your name removed from the 
prescreened offer lists, because when you call or go online to do 
so, you’ll be asked for identifying information including your Social 
Security number. But the good news is that it’s safe (or at 
least as safe as you can be) to give this information for the 
purpose of removing your name from these lists.

Keeping your computer 
secure

200
It seems that everyone does Windows, at least when 
it comes to a computer operating system. A key to 
avoiding fraud online is to keep your Windows software 
up-to-date with all the latest security updates. You’ll be notiﬁ ed 
when new updates to your Windows operating system become 
available. Don’t put off installing Windows security updates.
In addition to the updates of your Windows software, you should 
have a ﬁ rewall and antivirus and antispyware software installed on 
your computer. Firewalls prevent outside computers from gaining 
access to your computer, although they’re far from foolproof. 
However, like the lawyer joke about what do you call a hundred 
lawyers at the bottom of the sea: 
“It is a good start.” There are many 
ﬁ rewalls you can choose from. You 
can ﬁ nd out about free ﬁ rewalls at 
www.free-firewall.org.
Protect your computer with 
antivirus software such as Norton 
AntiVirus or McAfee VirusScan. 
Keep your subscription to whatever 
software you choose up-to-date. 
Your antivirus software is worthless 
unless it’s constantly updated to 
prevent the latest attacks. Getting 
automatic updates is a good choice.
Install antispyware software such as Lavasoft’s Ad-Aware, which 
can be found at www.adawareresource.com, or Spybot Search and 
Destroy 1.4, which can be found at www.safer-networking.org. Both 
of these are free, but once again be aware of proper spelling. There 
are phony versions of these programs that are spelled just slightly 
differently that are actually the very spyware that you’re trying to 
avoid. Installing one of the phony software programs would only 
infect your computer rather than protect it. It sure is dangerous out 
there in cyberspace.
Some other choices include Zone Labs’ Zone Alarm Internet 
Security Suite, which combines antivirus, antispyware, and antispam 
protection.
Keep your 
Windows software 
up-to-date with all 
the latest security 
updates. You’ll be

updates to your 
Windows operating 
system become

TIP Scammers gain access to your computer to implant keystroke 
logging programs and other malware. Downloading “free” 
computer games, screensavers, or music is a quick way to 
compromise your computer, affect your security, and increase 
your susceptibility to identity theft. Even downloading what 
you may think are free software programs to protect your 
computer from hackers may jeopardize you because you may 
be downloading the very malware you’re trying to avoid. Always 
be sure of the source of anything that you download online.
Zombies
Anyone who ever saw the Night of the Living Dead movies, 
particularly the ﬁ rst one, knows that zombies are pretty scary 
creatures. But as scary as they are, chances are pretty good that 
you’ll not be attacked by one of those kinds of zombies. However, 
the chances of your being attacked over the Internet and having 
your computer turned into a zombie computer is a very real threat to 
anyone who goes online.
Scammers who want to avoid 
detection send out viruses to the 
computers of unwary victims that 
turn their computers into zombies. 
Through your computer and 
those of other victims, a network 
is formed known as a botnet. 
The scammer then can use your 
computer to send out malware 
that may take the form of spam, 
Trojan horse keystroke logging 
programs, or even major denial-of-
service attacks. Denial-of-service 
attacks occur when your computer 
and other zombies in the botnet

ﬂ ood a target Web site with data requests that it can’t handle. The 
targeted Web site is effectively shut down as a result of such an 
attack. Threats of denial-of-service attacks have been used to extort 
money from major online businesses. At one time, it took some 
signiﬁ cant computer skills to create a zombie virus botnet, but now 
the technology has been dumbed down and sells for as little as $20 
to criminals looking for a new opportunity to scam the public.
Sometimes it’s difﬁ cult to know that your computer has been 
turned into a zombie. Some possible clues may be difﬁ culty sending 
emails or using the Internet or blood seeping out of the keyboard. 
Okay, I was just kidding about the blood and the keyboard. You may 
even notice emails that are returned to you as being undelivered 
that you didn’t send. If you have any concern that your computer is 
a zombie, have your computer scanned thoroughly by an expert to 
learn if it has been turned into part of a botnet and to remove the 
infection.
Security patches—The proverbial ounce of prevention is worth 
a pound of cure has never been more accurate than in dealing 
with an infected computer that has been turned into a zombie. 
It is much easier to prevent the problem than to clean up the 
mess after the fact. Prowling cyberspace are worms looking for 
computers that have security ﬂ aws and holes to exploit. Windows 
software is the most commonly used computer operating 
system. Like all systems, it has ﬂ aws. Microsoft does a good job 
of constantly updating its system with security patches, and it 
notiﬁ es people to install these security patches. Far too many 
people don’t. Don’t be one of those people. Update your software 
with security patches as soon as you’re notiﬁ ed.
Unsolicited emails and downloads—Most malware, spyware, 
and zombie viruses attack your computer through unsolicited 
emails. Don’t open any email if you’re at all uncomfortable with 
it. And never download attachments from someone whom you’re 
not totally conﬁ dent is legitimate. It’s in these attachments that 
many of these viruses come in. Also, many viruses and other 
malware come from sharing ﬁ les with people you’re not familiar 
with. Sharing music or games is a risky business even with 
people you know, because you don’t know where their

Wi-Fi

206
Free Wi-Fi hot spots are computer networks made 
available as a free accommodation by restaurants, 
coffee shops, malls, and airports; however, rarely are 
they very secure.
And even if a legitimate Wi-Fi hot spot were secure, you would still 
run the danger of using a Wi-Fi hot spot that is operated by an identity 
thief through a peer-to-peer network set up by a nearby computer 
hacker who is plugged into the Internet. This hacker’s network permits 
you to connect to the Internet through his connection rather than 
independently connecting to the Internet on your own. Because 
you’re connected to the hacker’s laptop, he sees everything you do 
online and may even be able to access your ﬁ les through ﬁ le sharing. 
He also is now able to install a Trojan horse keystroke logging 
program on your computer without your being aware of it.
So what can you do to protect yourself? To avoid the hacker and 
phony Wi-Fi connection, you should disconnect your computer’s ad 
hoc mode, which enables your computer to connect without wires to 
another computer, before you use Wi-Fi. You should also turn off your 
ﬁ le-sharing capabilities before using a Wi-Fi hot spot.
If you use the new Microsoft Vista 
operating system, you should turn 
off the Network Discovery feature 
that alerts other network users of 
your availability for connection. 
You should also use software that 
encrypts your email so that anyone 
who is able to intercept it will be 
unable to read it.
It’s a good policy not to keep any sensitive private data on the 
hard drive of your laptop. Judging by the many stories of laptops full 
of unencrypted, sensitive information being stolen, this policy is not 
being followed enough by many people in business and government. 
Use a USB ﬂ ash drive to hold the programs you need and your 
personal data in an encrypted form. When you boot up at a Wi-Fi 
hotspot, use the USB drive so that even if someone were able to 
get through your ﬁ rewall and other security programs, he 
would be unable to obtain any useable information from 
your laptop computer.

Due diligence

208
Before investing in anything, you should always do your 
homework.
To assist in evaluating the broker or salesman looking to 
sell you an investment, go to the BrokerCheck service of the National 
Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), a private regulatory 
organization at www.nasd.com/index.htm, or call them at 800-289-
9999 to conﬁ rm that the salesperson is licensed to sell investments. 
You can also check at that Web site to learn whether there are any 
complaints against the broker as well as any disciplinary proceedings 
or criminal convictions. In addition, you can check on whether the 
investment itself is registered. Follow this up with a look into these 
same issues with your own state securities regulators and the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
For business opportunities, contact the Better Business Bureau to 
see if there are any relevant complaints by going to its Web site at 
www.bbb.org. Also check with the Federal Trade Commission at 
www.ftc.gov and the consumer protection division of your state’s 
Attorney General.
Finally, when in doubt—and you should always have a little 
doubt—do what you always do when you need some information. 
Google it. Check out the investment and particularly the person 
pitching it to you on Google and other search engines. Don’t forget to 
try a search with the salesman’s name and the word scam. It might 
save you some money.
Some ﬁ nal words
Knowledge is the key to making 
ourselves safe from scams—
knowledge of ourselves and our own 
weaknesses as well as knowledge 
of the dangers that lurk in so many 
places.
Some people are overwhelmed by a fear of being scammed, but 
this kind of paralyzing fear serves no useful purpose. It’s better 
to heed the words of James Thurber, who said, “Let us 
not look back in anger or forward in fear, but around in 
awareness.” Be aware, and you’ll be all right.
